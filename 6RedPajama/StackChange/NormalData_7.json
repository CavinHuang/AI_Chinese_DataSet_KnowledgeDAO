["Q: What is the difference between iTerm2 and Terminal? I keep hearing that iTerm2 is much better than Terminal. However, when I downloaded iTerm2, I didn't see what made it preferable over Terminal. What are the differences between these two apps?\n\nA: There are several features listed on their features page.\nSome of the features I like are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Split pane view\n\n*Hotkey window for instant terminal anywhere\n\n*Search will highlight all found words (like in Chrome and Safari)\n\n*Mouseless copy\n\n*Instant replay (can \"rewind\" your session in case you forgot to note/copy something)\n\n*Paste history\n\n*Growl support for notification when a process completes\n\n\nA: The feature I chose iTerm for is being able to cut or copy by just selecting text and paste by just using the middle button\n\nA: @joel's answer is good, but Terminal.app gained some exclusive features in Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*support for Lion's restore feature\n\n*support for system services - this means I have a system shortcut for “new terminal in this folder” without strange hacks.\n\n*support for system services means great automator integration\n\n*document proxy in the window and generally better D&D support\n\n*right click on a string to search in man pages or open its man page in a cool floating window. Really handy!\n\n\nSee:\nhttp://www.macosxautomation.com/lion/terminal.html\n\nA: iTerm supports opening windows in full screen by default, and there is an option to use custom full screen windows that don't have the animations for changing spaces and don't disable ⌘H.\nIt also has an incremental search banner instead of a find dialog. And you can select text by searching for the start and pressing tab to extend the selection by single words.\n\nA: I use iTerm2 for my work in bioinformatics and have, for example, set it up in such a way, that it automatically opens a Genome Browser website in a specific chromosome position, when I cmd-click on the chromosome position.\nAlso, I tinkered with smart selection to allow me the selection of only DNA sequences, etc.\nAlso I set it to play a sound, if an Error message occurs in a terminal.\nThat's of course very specific use cases, but shows how capable iTerm2 is, compared to the simple Terminal client.\n\nA: If you're a keen user of VIM then mouse mode in iTerm2 works properly - you can position the cursor and select text using the mouse (it kind of works in Terminal but it's buggy). Plus when you're running VIM (or other console based apps that use the 'alternate' screen (t_ti, t_te)) then the scrolling works properly too.\nAlso there's a very useful search facility which can be used to search the contents of all open iTerm2 tabs which can be reached by going to Window->Exposé all Tabs(⌥⌘E).\nI also like the inline image display functionality which is possible using the iTerm2 tools tools which use some custom escape codes\n\nA: I just love iTerm because it does have the auto-complete for commands.thats just awesome.\nFrom the feature list for iTerm2's on its website:\n\nJust type the start of any word that has ever appeared in your window\n  and then Cmd-; will pop open a window with suggestions. The word\n  you're looking for is usually on top of the list!\n\n\n\nA: Besides the features already listed, iTerm2 is constantly improving, while Terminal receives minor updates every few years. Feature requests have a much better chance of being honored in iTerm2. There are some cool things coming in the next release that are not yet documented, but have a look through the recent release notes to see them.\nAlso, I'd note that there's some confusion about split panes in a comment in the OP. Terminal's split panes give you two views of the same window, while iTerm2's give you unlimited independent terminals in one tab.\n\nA: From the iTerm2 web site:\n\niTerm2 has a lot of features. Every conceivable desire a terminal user might have has been foreseen and solved. And these are just the main attractions!\n\niTerm2's feature page highlights the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Split Panes\n\n*Hotkey Window\n\n*Search Highlighted\n\n*Autocomplete\n\n*Mouseless Copy\n\n*Paste History\n\n*Instant Replay\n\n*Configurability\n\n*Unixyness\n\n*256 Colors (or more!)\n\n*Readability\n\n*Mouse Reporting\n\n*Growl Support\n\n*Exposé Tab\n\n*Tagged Profiles\n\n*Multi-Lingual\n\n*Triggers\n\n*Smart Selection\n\n*Shell Integration\n\n*Automatic Profile Switching\n\n*Inline Images\n\n*Timestamps\n\n*Password Manager\n\n*Advanced Paste\n\n*Annotations\n\n*Badges\n\n*Captured Output\n\n\nA: I use iTerm2 since I can't configure my Mac Terminal have different colors background when I open different Terminals.\n", "Q: How do I spin down a secondary disk when not mounted? I have Macbook Pro 13\" (Early 2011). I replaced the SuperDrive with a SSD that now is my main disk. The existing HDD is used for Time Machine and nothing else. \nI have 2 problems with the secondary disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*After a Time Machine backup, it stays awake way too long. I want it to go right back to sleep.\n\n*When I eject the disk, it keeps waking up after a while, and then keeps spinning forever.\n\n\nHow can I fix these 2 issues?\nEdit\nI found a program called Cocktail that you can set the sleep timer with, unfortunately this is for both disks. How will this affect the SSD?\n\nA: Solution is a terminal command with which you can control the sleep timer.\nI set it to 1 minute.\nsudo pmset -a disksleep VALUE\n\nThis still means the disk wakes up every hour for the time machine backup, and also every 15 minutes-ish for god knows what reason.\nBut its much better than before, just annoying that it regularly wakes up for a minute, which is distracting.\n\nA: Time machine backs up at 1 hr intervals but the interval can only be changed if you download an app called \"time machine editor\" located here:\nhttp://timesoftware.free.fr/timemachineeditor/\nFirst you turn off time machine from the Apple Time Machine app, then down load time machine editor and turn on time machine from within the editor.  The editor also allows you to set your back up interval to whatever number of hours you want.  From then onwards, time machine editor controls Time Machine.   BUT..... this still didn't solve my Mac waking up every 15 seconds......I suspect the external hard drive is causing this.  \n", "Q: LogMeIn Hamachi \"Network\" menu gone in Lion I have used LogMeIn Hamachi to play on different game servers, however since I update to Lion I have been unable to change the server I want to connect. The whole \"Network\" menu is gone.\nHere is a video showing LogMeIn Hamachi in action, where the \"Network\" menu is visible: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf2ttAWFrxg (See 1:20)\nI have the latest version installed (2.1.0.65)\n\nA: Just found out now that you have to click the connect button first and then it works perfectly.\n", "Q: Screen turns off at lid opening When I close the lid, the computer behaves correctly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen turns off  \n\n*Does not go to sleep (front light stays on and does not flash)  \n\n*Still can hear fans\n\n\nIt behaves this way because I share my wired network connexion via Wifi (System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing).\nWhen Internet Sharing is disabled, the computer goes to sleep and at lid opening, I don't have the problem described below.\nWhen I open the lid:  \n\n\n*\n\n*The screen turns on...  \n\n*...and turns off about 2 seconds later\n\n\nI can see my desktop background and the login screen for 2s, and after that the screen becomes black (actually it really turns off, that's not backlighted black).\nThe little trick I found is to reduce the luminosity thanks to the F1 key, and then increase it again to come back to maximum luminosity thanks to the F2 key.\nIt's not really handicapping since I found this little trick, but it's a little bit annoying to have to do that every time I open my Macbook :(\n\nComputer specs :\n  - Macbook Pro 15\" bought 2 months ago\n  - It came with OS X Lion already installed\n  - I choose the screen resolution option (don't know if it matters)\n\n\nUPDATE : Doesn't seem to be a problem any more in Mountain Lion.\n\nA: There is a similar discussion on discussions.apple.com from which I picked the hint to run\npmset -g assertions\n\nto list a summary of power assertions. Assertions may prevent system sleep or display sleep.\nIn my case I had a print job in queue that was preventing sleep.\n\nA: I stumbled onto this link when trying to find out why my 15\" MBP (late 2011) macbook pro with Lion (10.7.3) would not keep the display on after opening the lid and plugged in.\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your laptop.\n\n*Close the lid.\n\n*Open the lid.\n\n*Type your password.\n\n\nExpected result:\nThe laptop wakes, the display shows the login screen and remains on.\nActual result:\nThe laptop wakes (the keyboard is lit), the display shows the login screen for approximately 3 seconds and then goes dark.\nWorkaround:\nUnplug the laptop, and successfully login then plug the laptop back in.\nFix:\nAs another poster stated, it's the network attempting to access resources which shouldn't be available when the lid is closed then when waking the laptop it is technically already awake.  I did not have internet sharing enabled, however, the only difference between adapter and battery options in my settings was \"Wake for Network Access\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your System Preferences.\n\n*Click Energy Saver from the Hardware section.\n\n*Click Power Adapter.\n\n*Un-check the box for \"Wake for Network Access\".\n\n\nThis resolution assumes that Internet Sharing is not enabled in System Preferences -> Internet & Wireless -> Sharing\n\nA: Try Resetting the PRAM. That's always the first thing to try for strange behavior like you're experiencing it. \n\nA: What you describe actually doesn't make sense.  If you enable wake on lan then the machine will go to sleep but will respond to a wake on lan packet.  The machine will also boot if completely off with the same event. \nHow long are you waiting for the machine to sleep?  Chances are you're not waiting long enough because you might not be aware of how sleep works on a Mac laptop.  If you tell a Mac laptop to sleep it first writes out a hibernate image to disk and then goes to sleep.  If for whatever reason that battery dies before you wake the computer it will resume from the hibernate image, if the battery does not die then it wakes from ram. \nWhat you're describing sounds like you are closing the lid and then opening it before the machine actually enters sleep state.  As far as I know, short of using some software, there is no way to prevent the machine from entering sleep when you close the lid if there isn't a keyboard/mouse/monitor attached.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Air 2010 and I have those problems too (no more screen backlight after sleep and sleep going wrong with possible over heating).\nA friend of I told me his MacBook Pro does that too since Lion.\nI presumed that is a Lion induce problem, ether the system itself and me maybe 10.7.2 will fix this, or due to an app which could work badly with the new app state saving thing.\nDo you use Chrome, Adium or SparrowMail ?\nI suspect one of those that could be it, but since the problems don't show off all the time I don't feel like spending hours to fix this.\n\nA: I've noticed that no one here is actually looking at the problem correctly. I have the same problem when I leave on internet sharing but I assume it is only a small bug. The internet sharing keeps the computer awake with the lid closed and the hardware has conflicts with it because it should sleep with the lid closed. So you get some mismatched commands from the computer causing the problem upon opening the lid. I haven't tried it but resetting the power assertions looks like the only good answer on the page. The rest of them won't fix the problem\n\nA: If plugged in, my 15\" MBP late 2011, would not sleep when the lid was closed and if I opened the lid the screen would come on for about 1-2 seconds and then the back-light would turn off. After disabling org.cups.cupsd every thing was back to normal ! :)\nFrom this link.\nCups\nI noticed that a process called ‘cups’ was making TONS of requests on my local network. CUPS is “the standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple Inc. for Mac OS X and other UNIX-like operating systems.” (via discussions.apple.com)\nTo see the list of services running on your machine:\nsudo launchctl list\n\nYou should see org.cups.cupsd in there. \nTo disable it:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cupsd.plist\n\nTo re-enable it:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cupsd.plist\n\nYou can run sudo launchctl list again to see if org.cups.cupsd is there or not.\n\nA: Unchecking the box Wake for network access in System Preferences > Energy Saver got rid of the backlight shutting down after 2-3 of reopened lid for me. This also allows me to immediately open the lid back up without fault. Seems like a software default setting that doesn't mesh with the impedance of power thresholds of some transistor(Swithch[i.e., SW]).\n", "Q: How to send 'print' key with RDC (Remote Desktop Connection)? I use Microsoft's RDC on Mac. I need to click on print key to have some screen capture, but Mac Keyboard doesn't have one.\nHow do I send print key with Mac through RDC?\n\nA: Try Option + F4- it worked for me!\n\nA: \nThe MS RDC has a preference menu so that you can customize the shortcuts.\n\nA: Try using the virtual keyboard windows has under the \"accessibility\" programs menu\n\nA: Shift+Control+3\n⇧+Ctrl+3\nIt worked for me! (I'm using rdesktop on Linux > Windows Server 2012 R2, with -K option).\n\nA: The print screen command on a Mac is:\nShift+Command+3 \n⇧⌘3\nSo on Windows it would most likely be:\nShift+Control+3\n⇧Ctrl3\n", "Q: Will Lion install MySQL with it? I had MAMP running on my laptop. I use MySQL a lot. I kinda messed with the user file permission and I fixed it , in that process I changed some password in MySQL config files. So now SQL does not work even though MAMP runs perfectly.\nI was planing on installing OS X Lion. I am wondering if upgrading to Lion will install MySQL and all its packages? Will it fix the problem? Or should I have to reinstall MySQL even after I upgrade?\n\nA: No, I don't believe Lion comes with any sort of SQL server pre-installed.\n\nA: You probably need to reset the root MySql password, there's a guide on how to it on HowToForge. You only need to have it happen once, back up the config files before tinkering with them\n", "Q: Use Apple TV and iPad 2 in a car How can I use an Apple TV with the iPad 2 where there is no internet WiFi? e.g. in a car?\n\nA: It can't be done. If you want to watch media on the iPad in a car, copy the media (music, movie, TV show, photo) to the iPad via iTunes before you leave.\n\nA: @Negrino is right, you cannot do this. What's stopping you from copying your movies etc onto the iPad and just using that? That's one of the main advantages of having such a beautiful portable device!\n\nA: Using an AC converter, you could run a Wi-Fi router in your car and set up a network with a lightweight media host.\n\nA: Neither device is capable of starting a wireless network, adhoc or otherwise.\nHowever, you likely have a laptop with you.  You should be able to start an ad-hoc wireless network, attach both devices, then stream between the two.  You can also use a wireless router to set up a real network and attach to that.\nDepending on what you're actually trying to accomplish (watching digital movies on the go, watching streaming movies on the go, playing iOS games on the car TV, etc) there is likely a better solution to the problem than an apple tv, router, and ipad.  However it can be done if that is your only option.\n\nA: Yes it can be done if you Jailbreak.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Mywi on it and create a network.\n\n*Use a power inverter in your car to power your Appletv 2\n\n*Configure the AppleTv onto the new network you created\n\n\nYou now have full airplay in your car audio and video.\n", "Q: How can I log into the desktop environment as Root on a new mac running 10.6 or 10.7 without creating a user account? Under Mac OS 10.5, you could boot a fresh-out-of-the-box Mac into single user mode, mount /, set the root password, and touch .AppleSetupDone - this would allow you to log into the desktop environment as the root user without ever creating a 501 user. I've never been able to do this under 10.6 or 10.7, however. Has anyone been able to do this without first creating a traditional user account? \nMany thanks!\n\nA: You can still use SUM by holding Cmd + S when booting up.  If I recall correctly from the last time I did it, that should automatically give you root.\n", "Q: Will changing my harddrive to a SSD void my MBP 2011 warranty? I want to upgrade my harddrive to a SSD. Does apple offer this service? I was going to do it myself, since its easy. Does this void my warranty?\n\nA: No, it will not void your warranty. If you refer to the top of these instructions, they clearly state only a deviation of the steps outlined may void your warranty:\n\nFollow the instructions in this document carefully. Failure to follow\n  these instructions could damage your equipment and void its warranty.\n  Online instructions are available at\n  http://www.apple.com/support/diy/\n\nTypically, anything that is printed in the owner's manual is covered under warranty. RAM and changing the hard drive are both topics that are carefully covered, so legally speaking, that means they are user serviceable. Anything user serviceable is covered under warranty (following the above proviso of course).\nUnless it explicitly states in the manual that such modifications must be performed by a qualified technician, you will not be in breach of your warranty.\n\nA: http://blog.macsales.com/18244-owc-diys-wont-void-your-macs-warranty\nThe link above states the following:\n\"We address this topic directly with customers via our support portals and are happy to inform you here of the same fact: upgrading your Mac does not void its warranty.\nThis consumer protection is owed to the little known Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975. Put simply, the act states that a company can’t require you to upgrade with only its own branded parts to retain the warranty. This important act protects your rights as a consumer and allows you to install OWC upgrades with peace of mind confidence.\"\n", "Q: How do I make Firefox open a PDF in a tab instead of downloading it? I find it really annoying, that firefox on my Mac (OS X Lion) automatically downloads a pdf instead of viewing it in a tab. On Windows this works flawless. But why is it not working on the Mac? Is there a way to change this?\n\nA: What you need is a PDF plugin for Firefox. For instance, this PDF Browser Plugin will work for that. It will allow you to open a PDF in the browser without downloading it.\nMore information on this Firefox support doc.\n", "Q: Mac Mini Won't boot with a PC keyboard The Mini was installed with Windows 2003 now and its the only OS installed. It's a Mac Mini A1176 and now I want to install reformat the box and install Mac OSX.\nBut the problem is unlike any other Mac products I have, by holding 'c', 'shift', 'option', or 'd' on the keyboard immediately after power on the box cannot successfully change the booting sequence, it only boots from hard disk which is installed with Windows now.\nI think the problem is that I'm not using a Mac keyboard, but a normal PC keyboard, is that because it doesn't recongnize the keyboard at the booting stage?\nPlease tell me what to do to force the box to boot from CD, because I don't have a Mac keyboard with me right now.\n\nA: (reposting my answer from your Stack Overflow question in case you don't check that one)\nIf you have Apple's Boot Camp utility installed in the Windows installation, you should be able to choose the startup volume from its' control panel. Insert your OS X install disc, choose that as your startup volume, and reboot.\n", "Q: How do I change the menubar transparency in Lion? So I love the login screen in OS X lion, and I want to make my desktop look like that. I found the background image they use, but now I want to make my menu bar completely transparent like it is in the login screen. \nI've tried the \"translucent menu bar\" option in system preferences, but thats not the same at all. I googled quite a bit about this, but I can't find anything. Any ideas?\n\nA: You would most likely need to use a translucent/transparent background image to accomplish what you're asking. If you know how to make an image 90% transparent then you should be able to experiment and to come up with something similar. Tweaking the UI is art in many ways, however, it's not necessarily a function of the interface creating the effect; the elements that compose it (background color, wallpaper, dock and icons) play a key role. \n[posted for reference] \nSystem Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Translucent menu bar\n\n\n\n*\n\n*One app that I've used to achieve a similar effect is called Nocturne. I'm unsure of it's compatibility with Lion though.\n\n\nA: is this what are you looking for?  \nMenu Eclipse 2  (Mac App Store link)\n\n", "Q: Fixed region screen capture on Mac OS X? I use both Windows and Mac OS X on my work/home computers, and on Windows I love SnagIt, because it allows me to capture fixed regions of the screen: I select a resolution (for example, 500x400), and then when I click on the capture button a rectangle with that fixed dimensions appears on the screen. I only have to move it to the exact location of the screen where I want to make the capture and it's done. \nThe capture utilities that I've used on Mac OS X (native, or Jing, for example) doesn't have this feature afaik. \nIs there some way to have this kind of feature in Mac OS X? Any utility that could add this to my day-to-day?\n\nA: The free screen capture tools built into QuickTime and the OS will allow you to take full screen video capture as well as partial captures. You can then edit these down using preview and iMovie to crop and adjust them. This takes time, so there is room for some inexpensive apps that help you by pre-defining the capture area so you don't have to edit down a larger file or worry about being pixel perfect each time you make another capture using the mouse/trackpad.\nI use Skitch for static images and used Screeny for video images until Mavericks came out. It doesn't work now, so ScreenFlow is my tool of choice if QuickTime doesn't cut it.\nI'm hoping Screeny gets updated since it's lighter and simpler. Nothing will replace ScreenFlow for big projects due to it's post production workflow tools, but you might be well served by a less expensive option or even prefer simplicity over complexity if that's more important than a one time cost.\nSkitch is currently free, Screeny is $15 and ScreenFlow $99 - all are available on the Mac App Store.\n\nA: You can achieve the same result by using advanced editing capacities of ScreenFlow.  \n\nScreenFlow's advanced algorithms only encode areas of change on your\n  screen, so you can capture your entire screen with the highest quality\n  and keep your file sizes low. The ability to capture your whole screen\n  gives you the flexibility to record everything and decide later what\n  to edit out.\n\nYou record in fullscreen and then you crop during the post-processing step, handles zoom factor, add mouse overlays etc...\nIt's a very powerful workflow imo.\n\nA: I use Snapz Pro X for screencasts, but I believe it has the functionality you want for doing screengrabs of screen regions. You can specify a fixed resolution and move the rectangle to where you want to capture the image. It's $69.\n", "Q: Assign monospaced font family to selected text with keyboard shortcut in mac os x I write a lot of technical emails, and like to use a monospaced font for the code bits. Highlight text, hit apple-T, choose my font from the list of favorites, then close the font window. Is there a way to use a keyboard shortcut to apply a given font to the currently selected text? Ideally this would be OS-wide, but if that's not possible I can use it for just a single app (Mail.app)\n\nA: I've been looking for doing this for a very long time.\nI finally managed to end up with something that really works great for me, with the help of Alfred and Highlight CLI tool.\nHere is the Alfred script portion :\nquery=\"{query}\"\nif echo $query|grep -e \"^__SHORTCUT__\"\nthen\n    echo \"$query\"|sed -E \"s/^__SHORTCUT__//\"|pbcopy\n    syntax=txt\nelse\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}'\n    syntax=$query\nfi\n\npbpaste|/usr/local/bin/highlight --syntax $syntax --font Menlo --font-size 12 --out-format=rtf|pbcopy\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using {command down}'\n\nMake sure the shortcut trigger adds __SHORTCUT__ to be recognized and argument is \"Selection in OSX\" :\n\nShort demo https://youtu.be/y8NJT52APRQ\n\nA: I don't know of a system-wide way to script the Fonts panel but here's a few ways to get quick access to monospace fonts in Mail.app\nWay 1: Plan Text Message\nGo to Mail.app's preferences > Fonts & Colors and check the checkbox for \"Use fixed-width font for plain text messages\"\n\nNow when you're in a message where you want to use a monospace font you can simply hit: Command-Shift-T and you can toggle between the fixed-width font of your choice and your standard font (plain text message & rich text).\nThe downside of this method is if the receiver has not set their font to a fixed-width font they may not see the message as intended.\nWay 2: Set the Font with Applescript\nThe second way to do this would be to create a new message with the correct font chosen using Applescript. You can do that like this:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set outgoingMessage to make new outgoing message\n    set fontFace to \"Times\"\n    tell outgoingMessage\n        set the content to \" \"\n        set font of content to fontFace\n        set size of content to (14)\n        set visible to true\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nYou do have to set the content to something with this script. It seems Mail doesn't let you set the font for an empty message.\nWay 3: Use TextExpander\nThis way costs money but it might give you what you are after. You could setup a couple of TextExpander ($34.99 USD on the app store) shortcuts for fixed width and normal type so that you can switch back and forth by typing a few characters.\n\nTextExpander will allow you to insert rich text (text with a font, color, style, etc set). Just create a snippet of type Formatted Text, Pictures and set a font for the text you'll be inserting. You will need to include at least a space character for this strategy to work.\nYou will need your snippits to include at least a space character to ensure that the font will take.\n\nA: What I ended up using was manually specifying monospace in some text, then Format -> Copy Style (Option+Cmd+C) which copies the format but not the text. Then select some other plain text and Format->Paste Style (Option+Cmd+V) which assigns this format to the selection. After restarting, you need to do this again, and it only works for one style, but this meets my needs.\n\nA: Copy a character with a specific style:\necho \"<span style=\\\"font:14px 'Monaco'\\\">&nbsp;</span>\" | textutil -format html -convert rtf -stdin -stdout | pbcopy -Prefer rtf\npbcopy -Prefer rtf doesn't include plain text data, so paste will only work in rich text views.\n\nInsert a character with a specific style:\ntry\n    try\n        set old to the clipboard\n    end try\n    set html to quoted form of \"<span style=\\\"font:14px 'Monaco'\\\">&nbsp;</span>\"\n    do shell script \"echo \" & html & \" | textutil -format html -convert rtf -stdin -stdout | pbcopy -Prefer rtf\"\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\n    delay 0.03\n    set the clipboard to old\nend try\n\n\nPaste style:\ntry\n    try\n        set old to the clipboard\n    end try\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using command down\n    delay 0.03\n    set input to Unicode text of (the clipboard as record)\n    set txt to quoted form of (\"<span style=\\\"font:14px 'Monaco'\\\">\" & input & \"</span>\")\n    do shell script \"echo \" & txt & \" | textutil -format html -convert rtf -stdin -stdout | pbcopy -Prefer rtf\"\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\n    delay 0.03\n    set the clipboard to old\nend try\n\n", "Q: How can you add your own custom video to your iPhone/iPod on start up?

If that's not possible I'd like to define standard settings for the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Turning off \"natural scrolling\" when using the trackpad  \n\n*Turning off \"welcome screens\" for Firefox, iWork and others  \n\n*OS language\n\n\nA: How to Customize the Guest Account\nIt would probably take me longer to type out how to do it than it will take you to make your changes so I am going to send you to this YouTube video which details the process:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra9ThVi7zZo\nThe only thing I would add is that may want to make a backup of the original template.\n\nA: The technique I use is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign into the Administrator account.  Enable \"fast user switching\".\n\n*Switch to the Guest Account.\n\n*Set things up as I like.\n\n*Switch to the Administrator account.  Copy preferences files as needed.\n\n*Log out of the Guest Account, and back in.\n\n\nI do the copying from a 'Terminal' window:\ncd /System/Library/User\\ Template/English.lproj/Library/Preferences/\nsudo defaults read /Users/Guest/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nsudo cp /Users/Guest/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist .\n\nWhich copies the current Guest dock to be the system default dock for new accounts.

I turned it on, and it seemed to start up normally.  I turned to my computer, which saw the connection, but couldn't successfully make a connection.  When I looked back at my iPhone, the option was completely gone.  I then went to the general -> network panel, and I see the personal hotspot, but the option just has the \"wait spinner\" going with no buttons.  This persists even after powering down and restarting the phone.\nWhat do I need to do to get this back up and running.\nA possible side effect is that I don't seem to be able to connect to my VPN, but that might be an unrelated issue with my VPN provider.  Not sure....\n\nA: Personal hotspot only depends on the carrier and the OS of the device.\nAssuming you have a backup (and it won't get overwritten during testing and activation of your newly wiped phone), you can restore the phone and set it up as new.\nIf that fixes the issue - you can then know it was software corruption. You'll have to decide if you want to slowly delete things on the phone after restoring from your backup or just start new and set it up again from zero, but you'll have determined that the carrier settings and the hardware are working.\nConversely, if it fails after a new setup - focus on hardware and the carrier for support.\n\nA: Tis thus. IOS personal hotspot is buggy at best. Other ios devices seem to connect o.k. but my iMac always causes iphone personal hotspot to crash. Requires me to reset all network settings in order to try again.\niOS is still a beta software the way Apple releases it. Marketing drives their product cycle, not quality and innovation.\n", "Q: Protect each user account in Lion? I have enabled File Vault in Lion on a shared computer with several user accounts.  Is it possible to encrypt each user home directory such that other users cannot access their data?  As it stands, I can go on the terminal and (using sudo) access all the files in all accounts.  I'd like to be able to prevent this.\n\nA: As you know - the root user can undo anything that another admin/root does, but since all calls to sudo are logged, so you could use that to deter and detect access. If you only need to discourage idle copying/browsing, the command below will restrict access to all but the root user and the owner of the directory.\nsudo chmod go-rx /Users/username\n\nUnless you are going to physically restrain the mac (to prevent access to the insides) and use a firmware password to prevent booting from an alternate OS where the \"bad actor\" can bypass all account restrictions and permissions, you'll need to consider installing Truecrypt or another actual encryption tool. It has a plethora of options to encrypt files, folders, entire hard drives, etc.\nAlso, for other hardening tips refer to this NSA document:\nhttp://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/factsheets/macosx_hardening_tips.pdf\nThe advantage of this over the legacy Filevault is it's more likely to be supported going forward and all of your encryption eggs are not stored in Apple's basket using just Filevault.\n\nA: It's easier to just have each user store their private information in encrypted disk images since the old Filevault (1) method of encrypting the entire home folder isn't something you can set up on Lion with easy tools.\nLion does still support it, so you could migrate in a shell system that had the necessary accounts set up to use file vault, then encrypt the drive and finally move in the files from a backup external drive and presumably have both the legacy filevault storage scheme as well as the new scheme where the entire disk is unavailable until the drive password is entered.\nKeep in mind - root (and any admin user that knows sudo) has total control of the system and can delete, remove any protection that was set by root. Using encryption with a distinct password is the only method to prevent root from actually making sense of the files it can easily access.\n", "Q: Adding copyright info on each photo using iPhoto Is it possible to add copyright information, or a logo, on the pictures themselves (bottom right corner for instance) for a selection of photos, at once, using iPhoto ?\nIf iPhoto is not the right app to do it, what would be a free tool to do it ?\n\nA: Your best bet would be to use an application such as ExifShopper, which allows you view/edit image Exif information; It's free and also let's you do batch jobs. I wouldn't recommend iPhoto for doing this, people have complained quite often about it corrupting Exif data, etc.\nIf you're looking to watermark your images try iWatermark. \n\nA: I finally found an app that makes it very well; I let the information here for future readers. it's called JetPhoto Studio. And there is free lite version that allows watermarking. \n", "Q: Where can I test a path? I have tto check a path like \"volume1:FTPRoot:StenRoot:Stnp00:A12:B38:f000031913\".

I don't know much Mac OS X tools, so I was wondering if anyone could let me know how I can copy my entire harddrive (including OS) to my SSD.\nI have a MacBook 2011 and am using OS X Lion.\n\nA: CarbonCopyCloner or SuperDuper. Both are amazing programs, and will do a bit-for-bit copy to your new HD. CCC is free, while SuperDuper costs about $30. There are very few differences between the two, so I'd go with CarbonCopyCloner for being free.\n\nA: I just connect the new SSD using a cheap USB to SATA adapter, install Lion on the new drive, then boot from that new drive (hold the option key while booting to select an alternate boot source). \nIt asks if I want to migrate data from another drive, and I say yes and point it at the internal drive. Everything migrates over, you get to test things on the external drive to be sure all is good, then power off and make the exchange.\nThe benefit is this gets you a Lion recovery HD since some of the imaging tools don't yet perform that operation and only move the main partition data to the SSD.\n", "Q: Good Video Editing Software, around $100? I'm looking for some Video Editing software that allows me to\n\n\n*\n\n*Have more than one video track, so I can do Picture-in-Picture, cross-fades etc.\n\n*Read AVCHD and AVCHD Lite\n\n*Have good options for synchronizing video and audio\n\n*Have a few limited options to cut audio and take parts of audio, just so that background tracks can be made to fit\n\n*Export into at least one standard format, be it uncompressed so that I can do it later\n\n*Compatible with Lion\n\n\nUsually, Final Cut Pro X would come into mind now, but it's $300. In the Windows world, there's stuff like Pinnacle Systems Studio, but I don't know what's available on a Mac and what doesn't totally \"suck\" (\"Consumer\" Products that are limited, naggy and otherwise just a cash grab)\n\nA: Just FYI, I bit the bullet and went with Final Cut Pro X in the end.\n\nA: Check out Openshot — It's free and quite powerful; it's definitely one of the best. Another one you might look at trying is Mediaedit ($40), which isn't bad for the price. In my opinion FCPX is not much better than iMovie currently; Actually iMovie might be better.\n\nA: I would recommend getting FCE 4, if you can find it. I was able to get it for $50 from a friend. The one thing I haven't figured out is how to export nicely from FCE. I think I may have solved it by getting the $50 Compressor from Apple. I highly recommend the editing part fo FCE, but I'm not so sure about the exporting. I know there's a way; I just haven't figured it out.\nEDIT: FCE 4 is just fine when you export using Export>Export to QT, then drop it into Compressor.\n", "Q: Show text in large type on the screen via terminal I can put large text on the center of my screen with certain apps, such as Address Book (click on a phone number and choose \"Show in Large Type\") or using Quicksilver (type some text and choose the \"Large Type\" action). \nIs there any way I can invoke this functionality from the terminal, to show arbitrary large text by writing, say, Applescript or a bash script? \n\nA: Since you already have QuickSilver installed:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Quicksilver\" to show large type \"your text here\"'\n\nYou can use this to define a bash function (and put somewhere like ~/.profile):\nfunction big {\n        osascript -e \"tell application \\\"Quicksilver\\\" to show large type \\\"$1\\\"\"\n}\n\nThen you can invoke it with arbitrary strings by doing\n$ big \"This will cause large text to appear\"\n\n", "Q: Can I delete the /Developer-3.2.6 or /Developer-3.2.5 folders? I did a quick, pseudo-system audit this morning and found an unexpected directory hogging up ~10GB of space on my drive. I assume that it's a remnant from a reasonably recent upgrade to XCode 4, but that's more of a guess than anything else.\nI'm not an Objective-C/Cocoa developer. XCode is really installed just to support Homebrew. Off the top of my head, I can't think of anything else that I do with it. \nAre these older 3.2.x directories safe to delete if I can reinstall Xcode 4 or will doing so make kittens cry?\n\nA: Nuke it (you've got a backup, right?)\nIf you run sudo /Developer-3.2.6/Library/uninstall-devtools it should clean up things like terminal add ons, but they take little space.\nSince you only use gcc and such for homebrew - you'll not need all the SDK and such from this old alternate install of Xcode. One compiler set is plenty unless you're really into maintaining some old code that breaks when the newer compiler sees it.\nIt's probably from an old install where you could pick an alternate destination - not something Xcode 4 moved around.\n\nA: Do you use XCode? If you don't go run the XCode uninstaller script, then go to the GCC installer github page and download that. It should let you keep running Homebrew without needing all the very disk heavy XCode iOS/OS X stuff included.\n", "Q: Is there a way to write rules for incoming calls? I'd like to write some rules for incoming calls on my iPhone.  For instance, if a call from a certain number comes in, I'd like it to go to voice-mail.  Or simply hang up and not answer at all.\nIs there a way to do this natively on the iPhone or perhaps an app that does that?\n\nA: Without jail breaking iOS - you can't get a phone call on any app but the Apple phone app (which doesn't support call screening as you asked).\nSome carriers will let you set this up - but it's nothing to do with the iPhone.\nLastly, there are tons of services that require another phone number. Google Voice is one where you can program quiet hours, white list or black list and have exactly such control. \nThe downside to these other apps is that you'll need to have people call your alternate number, so it's not as easy - even with the ability to port an existing number to GV and then get a new number from your carrier.\nSeveral iOS apps work with Google Voice like the official app and GV Mobile + and there are probably a hundred other VOIP solutions on the app store, but Google and Skype are the big players today.\n\nA: If you DO want to jailbreak, iBlacklist works great for this.\nYou can have blacklists, whitelists, lists just for SMS, lists that occur during a certain schedule (say work hours), multiple lists active simultaneously, and different actions for different lists, etc. \nSo you could use it to ignore some calls, some some calls straight to voicemail, and ignore other calls while automatically sending that number an SMS that says \"At work, will call you back tonight\" etc\n\nA: While there are some jailbreak options, which I think have all been discussed in other answers here. Have you tried just calling up your network and seeing if they will block calls from the specific number from ever getting through? You can certainly do this on landlines so I can't see why a mobile would be any different.\nThere is no feature built into the iPhone, nor any 3rd party iPhone app that will do what you're after. Unless you join the darkside ;)\n\nA: Settings/Do Not Disturb - select manual on(green), allow calls from (all contacts), silence (always).  This will allow all contacts on your contact list to ring through.  Everyone else gets the silent treatment.  \n\nA: just turn your phone on airplane mode!! and if you have wi-fi then you can turn on the wifi and still use the internet but you will not recieve phone calls or texts from anyone it will go straight to voicemail.. if you only want it for certain people tho then you need to call your carier and have them blocked. hope this helps\n", "Q: Continuous Scrolling Through Desktops on Lion I have a few desktops set up in mac and and browser with my calendar and mail in full screen mode.  In total I normally have 3 running.  I also have custom hotkey to quickly scroll through the desktops, but when I get to the last one how do can I make it cycle through to the beginning.  \nFor example if I'm on the 3rd of three desktops, is there a way I can go the right to a 4th, but since it's not there it will go back to the 1st.\nThanks\n\nA: Alas, this feature was removed along with some others when apple moved from Expose/Spaces to Mission Control.\n\nA: TheWellington is right, sadly. Using the Keyboard pane in System Prefs, you can still assign Command-n to take you to the nth desktop, though. So Command-1 (or whatever your favorite hotkey is) would take you to the first space from the third.\n", "Q: Can I flash a PC Radeon 5870 for use in a Mac Pro? I have a Mid-2010 Mac Pro, Single CPU, MC560LL/A. It's equipped with the Apple-provided Radeon 5770.\nHowever, I have a Radeon 5870 from my old PC lying around. I know I can't directly use it, but I wonder if there's a way to flash it to work with the Mac?\n\nA: Yes you can. Netkas has a ROM at that link that works for 5870s.\nYou might also get by without flashing by going the Hackintosh route and adding some kexts\n", "Q: Limiting a standard user to use 50 GB of the hard drive I have added a standard user for my brother on my Mac Mini, and I would like to limit the amount of space he can use on my hard drive, but I can't see where I can set this kind of restrictions.\nI have read online that you can set it from accounts; however, I can't see any option there. The only options I can see are checkboxes to allow the user to administer the computer, and to enable parental controls.\nDoes anyone know where I can set this?\n\nA: This should work for you:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a root shell session in Terminal with sudo -s, providing your admin password when asked.\n\n*Create an empty quota options file with touch /.quota.ops.user\n\n*Run quotacheck -a to generate a list of drive space used by user\n\n*Run repquota -a to list the drive space used by each user\n\n*Enable quotas by typing quotaon / (You can turn them off again with quotaoff / )\n\n*Set quota limits for a given use by typing edquota -u username\nThis will put you in a vi editing session, where you can set both hard and soft limits on drive space and inodes (files).\nNote: vi is a text editor and can be a bit of a handful to use if you're not used to it, try searching for a basic tutorial on the net if you've never used it before. \n\n\nYou'll get a file that looks like this:  \nQuotas for user fakeuser:\n/: 1K blocks in use: 14968, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)\n        inodes in use: 224, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)  \n\nThe soft limit can be exceeded for one file, allowing users to save a file which puts them over their limit but not allow them to save any more until they get back under their limit.  Hard limits cannot be exceeded though.  \n", "Q: Optimize macbook pro for internal SSD+HDD drives I upgraded my MacBook Pro by replacing the SuperDrive with an SSD. I'm now using the SSD as the boot volume and have all my applications. My home folder is on the HDD. \nMy question is how to best optimize my setup for speed/performance/lifetime. \nA few specifics questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the SSD the ideal location for applications?\n\n*Where should the swapfile be located? Will it decrease the lifetime of the SSD?\n\n\nMy computer's specs\n\n\nA: Yes, absolutely keep all of your applications on the SSD. You'd lose many of the benefits of switching to an SSD by keeping the apps on the main hard drive.\nAs for the swap file, there seems to be a good deal of debate both for and against on the subject such as on Super User and official Windows 7 support docs. My thought is to enable TRIM on the drive (using the handy TRIM Enabler) and keep the swap on the SSD. TRIM will help to minimize the read/writes, and everything I read implies that even considering the worst case for swap degradation, the drive will long outlast the computer it's in.\n\nA: Is the SSD the ideal location for applications?\nThe SSD is the ideal location for all your data. However, if you are short on room (as are most SSD owners), \"offloading\" some of the bigger and more generic files types (music, movies, etc.) is recommended and won't adversely affect the performance of your day to day.\nHowever, with that said, having your home folder on a separate drive may be overkill as there are many small files housed there (application preferences, program caches, and other miscellany) that help your software and system function efficiently, and in doing so, you may inadvertently decrease your performance moderately to quite substantially in some cases.\nAlso bear in mind that OS X will create tmp files as needed and even juggle things back and forth depending on the demand and this is all written to the drive where your system is installed (places like /var/tmp, etc.). And truthfully, there is little point in purchasing an SSD to make use of its benefits if you are going to offload everything. SSDs are cheap these days and all have longer warranties (most are 5 years) than most traditional HDDs.\nWhere should the swapfile be located? Will it decrease the lifetime of the SSD?\nLeave the swap file alone. One of the first things new SSD owners do is scour their systems looking under ever nook and cranny for ways to prevent read and writes (read: slow cell wearing), ultimately in an attempt to lengthen the life of their drive, as if they had only a few short months (BitMICRO actually debunked some of the myths around SSD life-span). This is an impossible task. OS X (and all other OSes) perform millions upon millions of small read/writes to and fro in their tasks.\nFiles are cached multiple times over and a lot of \"voodoo\" is done under the hood. Lion, with Versions, local Time Machine backups, etc. doubly so. It will drive you towards insanity if you constantly worry about read/write cycles and all those that suggest the disabling of swap, running without atime, or even creating a RAM disk, are just peddling snake oil (however, there are some optimizations you can perform to free up space or reduce SSD wear, but the do often involve disabling services, which some may find useful). None of them ever present real, hard data on their performance increases. My car drives way better after it's had a good wash and detailing, but clearly, soap and water don't tune engines. It's a placebo affect and it is quite strong.\nNow the new trend is TRIM. Firstly, the only genuine article on the subject (which has been criticized to some extent, though no one has debunked it outright) shows that OS X benefits very little from TRIM. Secondly, TRIM enabler (developed by Oskar Groth) has been a point of contention lately, with some claiming the installer is inherently flawed. Grant Pannell took it upon himself to fix it. But one question still remains: Does OS X need TRIM? And if that's a resounding \"yes,\" under what circumstances?\nIt is now the case that many SSD manufacturers are putting their own garbage collection routines right on the drive. All SandForce chipsets come with something dubbed recycler, \"which intelligently performs garbage collection with the least impact on flash endurance\" (and it is now the consensus that TRIM shouldn't actually be used for any SSD with these controllers). Therefore, adding TRIM only serves to add overhead and decrease performance, albeit only slightly (based on my own testing using XBench and HD Speed Test). Other manufacturers, like Kingston, are also following suit by adding native garbage collection right on the controller (though this is nothing new). Therefore, it's not enough to flip the switch on TRIM and assume it's to your benefit.\nWhile the net is filled with misinformation and rumour, one particular person (Hyram) as posted some interesting information on the topic. You can head over here to read more about what he has to say as to why exactly Apple has not elected to enable TRIM for all SSDs (be sure to read his follow up comment as well, just a couple below). He talks of the following in his initial post:\n\nApple locked TRIM support for a very good reason — their code works reliably with the SSD’s they’ve chosen to use and no others, because they have programmed in nanosecond-critical timing loops that match perfectly with the access timings of the controllers used in Apple’s SSDs. Using these drivers with other controllers can, at best, slow them down, and at worst, increase the thermal effect that kills storage cells by forcing the controller to act when it isn’t quite ready. This thermal increase hastens the death of the SSD, reducing the already-low lifespan down to six months, if not less.\nThen there is the Sandforce issue. SSDs which use one of Sandforce’s DuraClass controllers (SF1200 or better) do not need TRIM at all, as they have their own garbage collection and wear levelling system built in which uses parallel writes, as there are actually two sets of chip controllers built in — whilst one is satisfying the demands of the host in reading & writing requested data, the other is autonomously managing the solid state arrays, shifting regularly-accessed data into new cells, updating block indexes and generally spreading the workload around to ensure thermal effects are kept to an absolute minimum. By enabling TRIM, the SSD is forced to work twice as hard as there are now two separate element management systems running, one from the OS and one built into the device itself. This dramatically increases thermal damage, and again, reducing the life-span of the drive.\n\nWhile no one has officially confirmed whether he's on the mark or not, you'd have to be quite thick to completely ignore his warning. To put it bluntly, it does make sense. If the issue is nothing more than telling a kernel extension to flip the switch on TRIM for all SSDs, it wouldn't make much sense for Apple not to do it. Many would counter-argue that Apple does it so you'll buy their high-priced SSDs, but from my experience, Apple is in the business of expanding the user-experience, not stifling it. There exist a myriad of cheap, 3rd party peripherals on the market (from video adapters to mice and keyboards) and Apple has not blocked any of them from working optimally. Why would they start with SSDs? Clearly there is more going on here.\nI urge you to look into your SSD and find out if it has on-board garbage collection. And even if it doesn't, I would give TRIM a second thought. It is my understanding and interpretation that TRIM is a deprecated system, in favour of much more efficient on-board garbage collection.\nIn all honesty, SSDs all carry a minimum 3 year warranty (most manufacturers have bumped it up to 5) and should the drive fail before then, you will receive a new one. Anandtech has written an exceptional article on the current state of SSDs that you may find useful, but even such things shouldn't frighten you. Just make regular backups and enjoy your new drive, balance the limited space of course.\n\nA: I just turned off my swap all together. I have 8Gb of ram on my 2009 MBP. I just don't see the value in adding Virtual-RAM (what the old Mac OS called it) where I never really seem to need any, and if anything just slows the system. The system has been running cool and cleanly for a while now. I'm sure someone will pipe up with some reason why that is \"dangerous.\" But it's a laptop, it has a battery, OSX is designed to hibernate before the battery dies. I rarely run any apps that would consume 8Gb of RAM anyway. I'm thinking of moving my home folder, and yes, the home library folder does hold plenty of user specific data for each Application, But the drive I'm planning to offload to is a hybrid. So I'm sure much of that library data will end up in the 4Gb SSD part of the hybrid drive, as it would be frequently accessed. \n\nA: OK, this is much later, but of course, now you would create/use a Fusion Drive with your SSD(s) and HDD(s). Then, the OS will manage putting oft-accessed files on the SSD and lesser used files on the HDD.\nAutomagically.\n", "Q: Is there a way to \"split\" one display so that it treated as two separate screens? Is there any app or hack which can split a monitor into multiple screens? So for instance, a 1920x1080 display could be treated by the operating system as though there were two 960x1080 screens connected instead.\n\nA: There's a major difference between Window Management and actually having the operating system, macOS, see one single monitor as two (or more) physical monitors.\nThe OP is asking for the latter.\n\na 1920x1080 display could be treated by the operating system as though there were two 960x1080 screens connected instead.\n\nEmphasis mine.\nUntil now, there have been no apps or hacks that would trick the OS into thinking there was two physical displays when there was only one.  The monitor, via EDID data, tells the system what type and configuration the connected display has.  In order for the OS to see two separate monitors, the monitor itself must present as two separate displays.  This also required separate display interfaces.\nThe LG 43UN700-B is a true hardware answer to the question.  It has a true \"4 screen split\" that is supplied by 4 independent inputs.  These inputs can be from one source (your Mac) or from 4 different sources like your Mac, a camera, a video game console and your PC (or any other combination).  The Display's EDID info will tell the connected system(s) that it's either a single 43\" monitor or 4 separate 21\" monitors.\n\nOther than the accepted answer, the other answers address the question with window management tools.  These tools simply automate the task of sizing and \"snapping\" the window to a particular location on the screen.  These apps do not present multiple physical monitors to the system.\nTL;DR\nIs there an app or a hack that can make macOS think a monitor is actually two (or more) separate monitors?  No.  However, circa 2020, LG has created a monitor that actually does this\n\nA: There isn't a software solution that answers the OP's request exactly, but in its place you might consider a window manager:\nWindow managers\nOriginal answer: Adding my vote for the window manager Moom! Excellent tool - as simple or complex as you need it to be, and keeps out of the way.\nThis is a tool that, like the ones mentioned in the other answer, lets you resize windows to fit defined sections of your screen.\n\nUpdate July 2019: Since writing this answer, I have switched to using Magnet which is even simpler and more modern; matching my needs.\n\nUpdate October 2021: I am now using a combination os Swish (mouse gestures for window management) and Yabai (automatic or command-line driven window management)\n\nA: Ever since the Mojave update you can hold click on the expand button:\n\nof any window to go into multi-tasking view where the screen is split into two distinct window spaces.\n\nA: Since El Capitan, you can zoom two windows to \"full screen\" in the same Space: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948\nTo the best of my knowledge, you can't rearrange the two applications within the Space (for example, splitting vertically instead of horizontally) other than swapping them side-to-side, nor have more than two windows in the same Space.\n\nA: There is No: True Multi-Monitor Support for a Single Display\nThere is no way to get the OS to treat a single display as more than one display.\nYou Can:  Fill Defined Sections of your Screen with an App\nYou can get very close to what you are looking for with a tool like SizeUp or Divvy. They will allow you to fill sections of your screen with an app. Halves, quarters, etc.\nUpdate: Answer still largely accurate as of 7/2020\nAfter many years a friend mentioned he came across this post. Here is an updated response:\nYou still can't do true Linux-like window management or split a large screen into multiple monitors. Mac OS has added to it's Spaces feature including the ability to have fractional spaces (two apps side by side) which is really just a first party version of the third part solution mentioned above. It is still very limited as a window management system and generally less useful than any of the third party tools mentioned in this thread so far.\nYou can find a pretty thorough walk through of Spaces over at Apple Insider.\nAlso, today I use Moom (as mentioned by other commenters below). I find it to be the best modern answer to this question.\n\nA: You can use BetterDummy to make your virtual displays, then do PIP window streaming without title bar. NOTE that the PIP streaming is only available with the $15 Pro version. I also believe that you need macOS Big Sur or newer.\n", "Q: How do I remove the \".local\" suffix from my computer's hostname?

From some googling, it appears that $ hostname macpro won't stick permanently.\n\nA: Just put macpro back in the sharing field.\nThe .local is there to catch fully qualified domain names and help with bonjour - you can't avoid that, but it won't show up anywhere but that pane.\n\n\nA: The submenu Sharing under System Settings is the preferred way to change the hostname of your machine.\nThe .local domain simply means that the IP address will be resolved by the Bonjour ZeroConf service instead of DNS.\n", "Q: Looking for a offline app to learn Spanish I'm looking for an app to learn Spanish offline.\nI want to hear it while driving, so it's basically MP3 based, and not interactive.\nDo you have any recommendation?\n\nA: Personally I use the language learning apps from BYKI, both on iPhone and Mac:\nhttp://www.byki.com/iphone/iphone.html\nServus!\nEdit to add more info why I like it (as per request in comment): The iPhone version has an AUTO button on the lessons. You start the lesson when you start driving, and just let it run (with the choice in preferences to say the text in only the language to learn, or also in English). Only issue is that the version I have (Italian) sometimes stops at the end of a lesson, but not always (weird issue there). When you are not driving you can enjoy the quizzes, flip cards, etc, of course.\nThe Mac/Windows versions come with MP3 files that you can put onto your iPhone and play in a loop.\n\nA: A new learning platform is coming out for the iPad.

Outlook 2011 does not support the webcal protocol for calendar syncing. It supported Apple's Sync Services as of Office 2011's Service Pack 1, but then Apple discontinued Sync Services support as of 5 May 2011.\nMicrosoft, unsurprisingly, wants you to sync your calendars with an Exchange server, not via webcal.\nTwo links from Microsoft will give you more information:\nHow to sync calendars in Outlook for Mac 2011 (don't get your hopes up; it basically tells you how you can't sync) and Outlook for Mac and Your Calendars (again, tells you what doesn't work).\nIt's unfortunate how this doesn't work. I suggest you consider strong calendaring alternatives, such as BusyCal.\n\nA: Here is one way to get webcal feeds to show up in Outlook 2011 for Mac if you are using Office 365.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Office 365 Web Application\n\n*Go to My Calendars on the left and right click\n\n*\"Open Calendar\" and paste your webcal URL into the \"from the Internet\" field\n\n*The calendar (basecamp or tripit for example) will now show up both in your Office 365 web app and also in Outlook 2011 for Mac (assuming you have this set up)\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to get a new MacBook Pro (Max OSX Lion) with the Aqua style on it? I am looking at Mac OSX Lion and I am not liking the fact that Aqua is gone. No more blue scrollbars, no more 3D look, no more beautiful Aqua design. (drop-downs, radios, scrollbars, etc.) I do not currently have a Mac but if I ever get one, (I highly want one, but they're too expensive for me to afford right now) I want the Aqua look back. Is there any way to do this? I really hope that there is.\n\nA: There is no \"official\" way of changing it, though OSX is customizable with 3rd party apps. I researched around a bit and found out though that most of these apps won't work with Lion. Perhaps as time passes by Lion updates for these apps will be released, and perhaps you will be able to make Lion look however you want.\nHere is a page with some themes for both Mac OS and iOS. They provide a theme for Lion, the only one I could find. \nNevertheless, I should clarify:\nAqua is still there. The term \"Aqua\" refers to the whole UI of Mac OS X, including that of Lion. Over the years it has changed, and it happened again in Lion. I too thought the Leopard-style aqua was better, but trust me, you will like the Lion Aqua. \nScrollbars hide automatically and they are meant to be discrete: having the blue scrollbars back would just defeat the purpose. Just the same, Lion tries to streamline elements such as tab views and progress bars that were perhaps to \"obtrusive\" to the eye, or called to much attention. \nIm typing this from a machine with Lion, and can tell you you will love the new UI whenever you get your mac. Just give it a try! :) Designers at Apple did a great job to my opinion.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Google Maps app crashes on open for iPad I'm traveling now and relying heavily on Google Maps on my iPad. with no warning, the app now crashes instantly when I click on it. no warning at all. I tap the icon, the default screen comes up, a second later the app closes.\nHas anyone else experienced this problem? More imporrtantly, has anyone found a solution?\nI tried restarting my iPad, as well as a hard reset. I do not have my laptop so I cannot sync. Since the app is one of the few default apps, I cannot delete and re-download it. I'm really at a loss here, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Deleting a downloaded app does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jettisons the data (like a reset for that app)\n\n*Allows for a clean copy of the app to be downloaded again\n\n\nYou could restore the entire device and test maps before restring your backup or you could back it up and erase all content and settings and then test.\nFlip a coin if one of those two options does not seem better to you and feel free to ask a follow on question if you find some more details to add to the question and don't want to edit them into the existing question.\n\nA: I was about to say \"Have you tried turning it on and off again\" ;)\nAs an alternative to what you're experiencing whilst in your situation have you tried just using Safari and browsing to http://maps.google.com? Failing that you could download the National Geographic Map app. This uses some older-style-maps and if you zoom in far enough it revents to Bing Maps. I don't know why they didn't go for Google maps, probably a licensing thing as their app is a tidy $3.99.\nThe only real answer I can give you is update your iPad.

I want to export my iPhoto library so that I can import it onto another computer and still keep the Events I've organized etc. How can I do this?\n\nA: Everything in your iPhoto Library is stored in ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.aplibrary (note that the extension is hidden by default).\nSimply copy that file to whatever Mac you'd like to move it to.

In iPhoto '11, I have created a slideshow and sent it to iDVD 7.1.2 (Share > iDVD...).\niDVD does fine with maintaining the timing, the music, the transitions, etc. However, even though I have the project set to 16:9 and under iDVD's options I have disabled \"Always scale slides to TV Safe Area\" the images of the slideshow are stretched vertically, compressed horizontally. No toggling of any of these options has had any effect. Burning to DVD, \"burning\" to image, and preview all show the same thing: stretched/compressed images.\nThis is not a problem of my player's aspect ratio, or my TV's aspect ratio.\nHow do I prevent image scaling when burning an iPhoto Slideshow in iDVD?\n\nA: The only way I've found to do it is to have iPhoto render the video, and then import the video file to iDVD rather than the slideshow directly through this \"integration\" of their apps and letting iDVD attempt to render it. \nThis worked fine, and actually didn't take as long to re-render from .mp4 to MPEG2 as I expected it would. I experienced no- or negligible loss of quality to the video during transcoding, although I'm sure that there was some as I was going from lossy to lossy format.\n", "Q: How can I charge an iPod with an unsupported cable?

I have found many Windows-based solution but nothing for Mac OS X.\nAre you aware of\n\n\n*\n\n*a build-in way to perform a diff (didn't find much in the help)\n\n*a standalone tool (for Mac)\n\n*an online tool (data is not sensitive, comparing in the cloud would be no problem)\n\n\nAt the moment the only solution I got is exporting to a comma separated file and compare with diff on the command line. I was thinking to write a small Perl script but before investing too much time I wanted to be sure I am not missing a simpler option.\n\nA: Usually what I would do is copy the Excel spreadsheets into Word, then use Word's Merge Documents feature (might have been Merge/Compare or simply Compare Documents previously to 2011) to see the differences between them. Depending on how big your spreadsheet is, however, that might not work for you.\n\nA: There is a Mac version of Araxis Merge, which is an excellent program for comparing and merging mange kinds of files, and folders of files.\nIts History page seems to suggest that it does compare Excel files on Mac.\nThere's a 30 day evaluation, so you could try it out and see if it does what you need.\n(I have no affiliation with the company - am just a very frequent user of the Windows version of the tool)\n\nA: You might want to try this tool. It does the job and it's free.\nhttp://www.nunobrum.com/excelcomparator.html\nIt works in Windows and on MAC OSX. It's based on a VBA macro running in the native Excel Application, so it doesn't need any installations.\nOnly suffice to enable the Macros and it works. \nContrary to other Excel comparators, this one also enables you to compare different sheets of the same workbook or, different ranges of the same sheet.

The question: is it somehow possible to easily synchronise the folder with a NAS storage device?\nI stumbled over this answer, but I wonder if it is also possible with the \"onboard tools\" of Mac OSX.  \nActually I would not mind using the command line and kicking of the process manually \n\nA: I would recommend that you look into using rsync. This is a very powerful and widely used backup tool that is included in OSX. You control it via the terminal, or via a script. Meaning that it can be scheduled to run backups at certain times or manually when you invoke it.\nThe prerequisite is that your NAS has an rsync server daemon running on it.\nThe beauty of rsync is that you can tell it to incrementally update files - that is, it will only upload files that are new, or have changed. (It can even upload the bits of existing files that have changed). It's very quick and efficient.\nCheck that your NAS supports rsync and then read into it, rsync is a large topic to cover here but I highly recommend it!\nTypically, you'll run the command like this:\nrsync [options] source destination\n\nCheck this page out for some good explanation and usage examples.\n\nA: I believe you can use rsync to accomplish this task:\nrsync -avz /<path to Photos>/ /Volumes/<NAS Mount>/<path to Photos>\n\nThe man page provides some more examples a well.\n", "Q: Where does OSX 10.6 store user specific location data For some reason, whenever websites try to identify my location, my MacBook Pro always gets confused and spits out a location that is not based on my current coordinates, but rather is my hometown, Cleaning browser data didn't help to solve this problem, thus I am thinking it has something to do with OS settings.\nDo you know if and where OS could store my incorrect gps coordinates?\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro does not have a GPS adapter. Geo location usually works on either looking up your IP address and nearby WiFi networks in an online database, while the latter usually gives better results. Location providers keep large databases of all WiFi networks and their location. For example, Google collects them while shooting photos for StreetView and also mobile phones collect them all the time. Looking up your location transfers a list of all networks in range to such a provider who guesses a location based on this list.\nIf you recently moved to another town, chances are high your own WiFi network moved with you but is still in these databases at the old location. Maybe there aren't more many more networks in range or they are unknown to the location provider. Thus, any geo location lookup returns your hometown as that is the only known spot where this WiFi network existed.\nYou could try to disable Airport and connect to the internet using a cable. This way the location provider only has your IP address as a fallback. At least this should give you a different result.\n", "Q: External applications opening Safari links in new window rather than new tab I've noticed that when an application, such as iChat or Twitter for Mac, sends a link to Safari it opens in a new window rather than a new tab. I can manually force it to open in a new tab by holding down cmd, but I'd like this to happen automatically. I don't recall links opening in new windows in Snow Leopard.\nTo be clear, I'm not talking about opening links within Safari itself, I've set these to open in new tabs already. I'm talking about external applications sending links to Safari.\n\nA: So this is strange - I just got this to work.\nIn the above window I set \"Open pages in tabs instead of windows: Always\" and then I unchecked the option for command-click opens a link in a new tab. After doing that - links from external apps opened as a tab in the same window.\n\nA: In Safari > Preferences > Tabs, there's a preference for setting when pages should open in windows or tabs. \nLook here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Safari > Preferences and select Tabs along the top\n\n*Under the option for \"Open pages in tabs instead of windows:\" select \"Always\" from the drop-down.\n\n\n\nThis will force every application to open links in tabs.\n\nA: If it only happens occasionally, it can be because there's some unsubmitted text on the location bar. If you've typed something on the location bar, open http://example.com opens a new window even if you've told Safari to always open pages in tabs.\n\nA: What I want to say is... the \"Safari > Preferences > Tabs > Always\" is correct.\nBut my suggestion is that... set the value \"automatically\" instead of \"Always\".\nin Always... if code wants to open the page in new window then also browser restrict it\nto open the page in the new page and open in new tab...\nbut in automatically... it opens according to requirement..\n", "Q: How can I specify delimiters in Terminal for word and character selection before copying and pasting? I am new to Mac and still struggling to be productive with fewer clicks and keys...\nWhen I use Terminal and click on a word, I would like the delimiter to be only space and not other characters like . _ / etc. I want these to be treated as part of the word. Then, I would like to be able to click on a word, be able to select the whole word and then copy and paste it to another place, say command line or into an editor etc. How do I achieve this?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: You might want to take a look at iTerm2, where you can set the word delimiter in the preferences. I'm a recent convert myself and like it a lot better than Terminal.app. There's a special Terminal.app keyboard shortcut compatibility set to make switching easier.\n\n", "Q: How do I move Mac and Windows partitions to single Hard Drive?

However, I do not want to reinstall Mac OS X. I may be able to reinstall Windows, but I'd like to avoid that as well.\nDoes anyone have some hints how I should proceed? I'm also worried about stuff like the Boot Sectors.\nCould I just use something like dd on the paritions? I heard about Carbon Copy Cloner, but that seems to be a file copy rather than a partition copy?\nSince the 600 GB Drive uses MBR, I need to wipe all partitions anyway and repartition using GPT, correct?\n\nA: Before you start, make sure you have a verified working clone of both partitions/systems.\nYou will ideally want to have software that can clone partitions, such as either the excellent CarbonCopyCloner, or the equally awesome SuperDuper, both of which will allow for your needs (complete clone) in their Shareware mode.\nI don't know what tools are suitable for PC, but find one that does the equivalent for Windows installations.\nReboot from your cloned Mac OSX installation, and prepare to repartition your target Hard Drive. Disk Utility can sometimes repartition volumes non-destructively, but for this I would recommend quick erasing the drive and repartitioning to the desired sizes for each OS, with a caveat for the situation below.\nRepartition as desired (ensure GUID, journaled, case-insensitive for the Mac Volume), noting you may need to go through various procedures if you are using OSX 10.7 Lion and wish to retain the hidden recovery partition (ie: you may have to reinstall Lion and restore from your backup, then proceed with Bootcamp installation which will again walk you through creating a suitable PC formatted boot volume which you can later clone your Windows installation back to).\nClone back the OSX Installation that you are booted from to the target Mac partition on the internal drive (if you haven't already restored from this in the previous step). Do the equivalent process in Windows for your Windows installation.\nTest each by booting into each and making sure everything works as expected.\n", "Q: Aperture to automatically import videos Is it possible to have Aperture import videos alongside pictures when importing from a phone. It can handle videos, but when it shows me the list of things to import, only pictures are displayed.\n\nA: Aperture 3.2.2 imports video and stills by default for me from my iPhone with iOS 5.0.1. Are you perhaps using older software or different hardware?\nThe only time I've seen Aperture not show items for import is when you take more photos / videos after the import window is open and the new captures will not show until you disconnect and reconnect the USB 30 pin connector.\n\nA: You may have video files disabled in the import options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Aperture and click Import\n\n*Click Import Settings on the right, and make sure File Types is checked in the list to show the File Types options.\n\n*Under the File Types options, make sure Exclude videos is not checked.\n\n\nIf these options are set properly, connect the phone, locate the video files in the Finder, and verify they're playable by Quicktime player and/or the Finder (via Quick Look).  You can also try importing the file directly, by dragging it onto Aperture's dock icon.\nIf you can't view the video via Quicktime Player or Quick Look, try installing Perian and rebooting, but I'd be surprised if this is the case; most Android phones record in standard formats.\nUpdate: Missing Sync reportedly correctly synchronizes Android videos, according to someone with the same phone as you http://androidforums.com/htc-desire/79684-htc-desire-mac.html\nThis is more of an alternative, but hope it helps.\n", "Q: How do you prevent a process from automatically restarting? (specifically, sophos antivirus) I am required by my VPN software to have Sophos anti-virus installed and running.

What do I need to do to prevent that?\n\nA: I'd comment on Agos' post, but I'm too new to do that. So:\nAs far as I remember they should have a launch agent in /Library/LaunchAgents. I'd just ask you to do a ls /Library/LaunchAgents, ls /Library/LaunchDaemons and ls /System/Library/LaunchDaemons. Something will show up.\nAlso you could open /Applications and check Uninstall Sophos.app with Show Package Contents then check out the uninstall script.\n\nA: man launchctl\n\n\nlaunchctl list |grep -i 'sophos'\n\nto unload a daemon permanently, but not uninstall it\nlaunchctl unload -w /full/path/to/file.plist\n\n\nA: This means that there is another monitor process which relaunches it.  \nYou can check out who is the parent process: select the process in activity monitor and use the Info button, or via terminal with ps -ax -O ppid if I recall correctly.\n\n\n*\n\n*It might be another process by Sophos but with a stealth name, or maybe even your VPN software. In that case you can just kill'em all.\n\n*The other possibility is that the process is being kept alive by the launch daemon launchd. In this case you will find an entry (a plist XML file) for your antivirus in either ~/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchAgents (likely) or /System/Library/LaunchAgents (I dearly hope not).  \nIf the second is the case, you can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file, and change the KeepAlive parameter, either removing or changing it (you can do nifty things, see the docs for more).\n\n*Just ask launchd to do the stopping for you. Unfortunately you can't just tell to launchtl stop since the process would just respawn. You'll have to use  sudo launchctl unload /path/to/the/plist file \n\nA: To find out which launchd job is spawning things back, tail -f /var/log/system.log and sudo kill -9 <pid> the process you are interested in.\nSuddenly, launchd will tell you exactly which job is responsible:\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.sophos.managementagent[83911]): Exited: Killed: 9\n\nYou can also try increasing the log level to precisely determine what's happening: launchctl log level debug\nBear in mind that some jobs will be run as root, so sudo launchctl list might show you some extra jobs running on your machine.\n\nA: You can also control which Launch Agent and Daemons run and when with the useful app Lingon, available through the Mac App store and online.\n", "Q: How to use an existing Apple ID to download free apps from App Store without using Credit Card?

In the last step, I'm asked to furnish credit card information, which I don't want to, since all I want to do is to be able to download free apps !!\nSo, do I have to register a second Apple ID just for downloading free apps ??\n\nA: As I commented - try setting your payment type to None in iTunes\nOpen iTunes, and go to the iTunes Store, then click on your account on the top right.

I am considering buying a used iPod touch. I really don't know too much about buying used iPod touches. What should I watch out for when I am looking at used iPod touches? (If it makes any difference, I am going with Craigslist rather than Ebay)\n\nA: *\n\n*First thing to look for is whether the unit has suffered water\ndamage. All Apple devices have two moisture sensors. One in the\nheadphone jack and the other in the cable connector port. They will\ncolour pink or red on water contact:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The next thing is the physical condition of the unit. Scratches,\nscuffs, or other physical signs of trauma. This one is rather\nintuitive, but what people don't often look for is 3rd party repair using shoddy parts. Look for bulges in the seal around the screen or scratches on the screws (which are signs the unit as been opened). A keen eye can find these discrepancies, and if you do, steer clear. Knock off, aftermarket displays (or so-called OEM replacements) don't have the same capacitative capabilities that the original units do. \n\n*Check the battery next, make sure it charges and shows the correct\ncharge/not charging icon. If the unit responds when a cable is\nconnected and disconnected, then there likely won't be any damage to\neither the internals, the battery, or the connector.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, trust your gut. If it even smells like too good of a deal, walk away. Ideally, it would be great to find a unit that is still under warranty and then extend that warranty with Apple Care. Another avenue would be to look to Apple's website for refurbished products. They all come with the same warranty as all new Apple products. Honestly, this would be the way I would go about it. You will get a \"like\" new product at anywhere up to a 30% discount.

If so, does this mean that I will lose the originals if I delete them from the card?\n\nA: The iPad Camera Connection Kit is simply a USB hardware interface. It performs no processing and can store raw as well as jpeg from a camera or SD cards. \nThe iOS photo app will show you the pictures it can, but of you have an exotic raw camera - it will simply hold the images unchanged to deliver to your computer rather than process or change any images.\n", "Q: Installing Python on Mac 10.5.8 64-bit I'm working on getting Python installed on my Mac 10.5.8 and I have been having a heck of a lot of trouble.\nThe standard downloads at Python.org do not show a compatible version.\n\n\n*\n\n*They have 10.3 - 10.6 for 32 bit\n\n*They have 10.6 - 10.7 for 64 bit\n\n\nI tried downloading and installing the 32 bit version for 10.5, yet when launching the IDLE, it \"Unexpectedly\" quits.\nI've been told that Python comes pre-installed on Mac OSX computers, but when running \"python\" in the terminal I receive this error:\nwilliam-johnsons-macbook:~ Will$ python\ndyld: unknown required load command 0x80000022\nTrace/BPT trap\nwilliam-johnsons-macbook:~ Will$ \n\nIf anyone has any advice or other references not on the python.org site, I would really appreciate it.\n\nA: It's been a long time since I had to do this for 10.5.8, but I followed these instructions:\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20090508090926/http://blog.captnswing.net/2009/04/19/python-mod_wsgi-64bit-mac-os-x-105/\n(note that the original website is gone, hence the WayBack link)\nHere's a post I made on the topic back when I was trying:\nhttp://buffalothedestroyer.blogspot.com/2009/04/python-64-bit.html\nBut, do you need 64 bit python on 10.5.8?  Frankly, I don't think it's worth the pain - I'd pay a few bucks and upgrade to 10.6 or 10.7.\nIf it's just a problem with 32-bit python, which python are you using? (i.e., what does which python return?)\n\nA: What's about python from MacPorts? it is the same as from Python.org, but for your architecture and you can manage libs more easily.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade the carrier settings without the original SIM? I have an iPhone 4 that I got from my uncle (it's a little used), but I don't have the original SIM that came with that iPhone, and I want to unlock it, can I ask the old carrier to unlock it with only the IMEI and others information that do not depend on the SIM card? Will it be able to receive a carrier settings update on iTunes?\n\nA: Yes. Carrier settings are sent when you connect to their respective cellular service. So if you purchased an unlocked iPhone 4 from Apple, and inserted a SIM from AT&T, you would be pushed the latest carrier update. If the next day, you removed the AT&T SIM and inserted one from Bell Mobility, then you would be pushed a carrier update for that respective carrier.\nThe updates are based on your iOS version number and the wireless network you are connected to (of course you need the respective SIM as well). You won't receive updates should you remove the SIM (or fail to insert one), but then it becomes a moot point because you need the card to connect to a network, making a carrier update rather pointless to begin with.\nWhen the original carrier unlocks the device, it will be able to handle any wireless network. And the new carrier you sign with, will issue you a SIM.\n\nA: I had to take it to the carrier, they didn't tell me if I could do this without them. That's all I know :(\n\nA: Been having the same problem for 4 months. I backed up and restored and it still didn't worked. I was pretty bummed out..and I really didn't want to go to a repair shop for phones cause they cost a tonnnn! So I just randomly thought that maybe something sticky got inside the button and used a pair of eyebrow tweezers (the pointy ones like this one: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31xBWTSHbiL.jpg) \nand I basically just stuck it around the button maybe 3 or 4 times really well and TADA! I DON'T HAVE THE ISSUE ANYMORE!!! I'm so happy I saved money by not getting it repaired :'D\n", "Q: Say name of a caller on iPhone Is there an app, or any other way, to make my iPhone 4 to say the name of the caller while ringing, just the same way we are used to on Nokia phones? Preferable without jailbreak or sophisticated scripting trickery...and preferably a text to speech solution.\n\nA: By default, no.\nBut it wouldn't be that hard to record the name (or perhaps using the voices in VoiceOver Utility to speak them), turn that into a ringtone, and then apply it to the specific contacts you have via the Address Book as a custom ringtone.\nIt's a bit of legwork, but it's a clean way of doing it and won't require any outside software or hacking of the device.\n\nA: I know you said Preferably without jailbreak, but if you do there are a few solutions:\nCallTell - Announces who's calling before ringing. Text support too.\niAnnounce - Announces incoming calls. iOS4\nI personally use CallTell and would happily recommend it.\n\nA: Google Voice has a feature similar to this. It's called call screening. The main problem with the feature, though, is that it will probably annoy your callers. Basically every time you get a call from a new number, the caller is asked to say their name. Then when you pick up the phone, you hear their name, and have the option of answering the call or sending it to voicemail.\nWhile it's not exactly what you requested (since you have to answer the phone before you hear who it was that caused the ringing), it does provide a similar solution.\n", "Q: iTunes can't download song purchased from old computer, on to new computer I bought and downloaded a song in iTunes on a PC of mine. I never synced it to my iPhone. Well, I got a new computer, and no long have the old one. I think there might be a problem now.\nHere is what happens when I click Check For Available Downloads in iTunes:\n\nAnd here is what happens when I click on buy, for the song in the iTunes Store:\n\nIs this a case of a badly worded dialog? I've seen something like this before in the App Store when I needed to reinstall a paid app. In that case I \"bought\" the app again, the second time without being charged.\n\nA: In iTunes 10.3.3 or later, select Edit, Preferences, Store.  Under Automatic Downloads you can select which categories to automatically download.  If Music isn't an option, then you'll have to transfer your library manually.  I suspect Music is only an option in the US.\nSee iTues Store Support for more information.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is the expected behaviour. Re-download of music is not supported.\nYou have a only a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for iCloud to become available for Japan. Currently Automatic Downloads for Music is only available in the US. Once it is eneblaed internationally you can enable it as Hand-E-Food described in his answer.\n\n*E-Mail Apple support and tell them you lost the music due to an hardware-crash or something similar. There are reports that Apple support allows re-downloads of your complete purchase history. But this is a one time offer and a courtesy of Apple.\n\n", "Q: Spilled stuff on my iPod, USB cable port doesn't work Today I spilled some yogurt I was drinking. My iPod Touch was right there besides the glass, so almost all the screen was covered. I quickly cleaned it with a wet towel, but some yogurt got into the USB cable port. I left the iPod standing vertically for a while, hoping that the yogurt would just fall off.\nThe iPod still works fine. The problem is that when I connect it to the computer, nothing happens. When I look into the port, there seems to be some white stuff, but I don't know if that was there before.\nShould I take the iPod to a Mac store, or should I attempt to clean it myself? If the latter, how should I do that?\nI can get pictures if it helps.\n\nA: If it's still under warranty, absolutely take it into an Apple Store (not an authorized Apple repair shop) and talk to one of the Geniuses. Tell them the story, and above all be completely honest with them.\nI've had my iPhone 4 replaced for a faulty home button, but couldn't reproduce the symptoms. My friend, the same deal (we really did try with his, but just couldn't reproduce the issue). My other friend dropped her iPhone 4 from a truck, smashed the glass. They happily gave her a new one, no hassle. My brother, same exact deal (although he did not drop it from a truck, but rather it fell from his pocket).\nSome Geniuses tell you they charge $299 for a replacement, but will often waive that fee the first time. Other's will smile and make your day.\nI encourage everyone I know to put Apple's legendary customer service to the test.\nNow if it's not under warranty, cleaning it before it sits on there too long and likely corrodes the connectors is an excellent idea. You want to grab a q-tip (cotton swab) and some isopropyl alcohol (try to grab 99.9% pure if you can). Do not use anything else, it will harm the connectors. And again, I strongly suggest you do this soon.\n", "Q: How can I use Sparrow to send iCal e-mail notifications instead of Mail.app? I am really annoyed how iCal uses Mail.app to try to send e-mail notifications. It always pops up Mail.app and I do not want it to at all. How can I make iCal use Sparrow instead to send e-mail notifications/reminders?\nI tried this: http://gidogeek.com/post/6037637963/ical-sparrow\nBut that didn't work for some reason.\n\nA: There is a solution to your issue but it requires a little AppleScript jiggery pokery.\nJohan Bruning posted an AppleScript for this on GitHub. He's included instructions for installing it in the README which is also visible on the project's GitHub page.\nIn his blog post about the script he writes, \"I am happy to report it works like a charm and my iCal now finally sends e-mails trough Sparrow.\"\n\nA: It is still using Mail.app because the script from github is the original. You need the other one which seems to be missing. Someone will need to contact the author to let him know that it is not showing up.\n\nA: As mentioned, I'm not sure about the specifics of your question/input, but I can confirm that the modified script does not function as the author intended (or confirmed as such). Apple Mail is still used to send notifications of iCal events even though I have completed the script workaround originally mentioned. \n", "Q: Keychain says \"Access to this item is restricted\" after upgrading to Lion I recently upgraded to Lion and since then I haven't been able to use Keychain to look at my stored passwords.  When I click on the checkbox to show them it prompts me for my master password, then pops up a dialog that says \"Access to this item is restricted\".\nBased on reading questions here and on other support sites, I've tried using the Keychain Access program's \"Keychain First Aid\" feature.  It reports that there are no errors.  I also used Disk Utility to Repair Disk Permissions, and this didn't fix the problem either.\nI looked in ~/Library/Keychains/ and it looks like I do have owner permission to read and write the keychain file, and my main account is the owner.\nIs there anything else I can try to fix this?  I'd hate to lose my keychain passwords.\nUpdate:\nI also tried dragging my login.keychain file from Finder into Keychain Access, and had no luck.  I tried some digging around in the security command line app as well, but have made no progress...\nUpdate 2:\nAfter trying all the suggestions I commented on here I was still getting this error, but then I did a software update, and rebooted, and now my keychain is working again.  So, I have no idea what went wrong, but it is now fixed!  I'll just pick an answer as accepted.\n\nA: There are several reasons Keychain does this. Often it's because a new account that you might have switched to does not have the same/correct paths to Keychain that it used to. For starters try changing the main login password of your account; if that doesn't do anything try this in terminal:\n$ sudo touch login.keychain\n$ codesign -vvv /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\\ Access.app\n\nIf you get an error such as:\n/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app: code or signature modiﬁed\n\nthen:\n$ codesign -vvv /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\\ Access.app\n\nwhich should give you the response:\n/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app: valid on disk\n/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app: satisﬁes its Designated Requirement\n\nReboot.\n\nA: For starters Keychain has a nifty little tool called: \"Keychain first aid\" (⌥⌘A) which should do the trick. After completion you do need to logout and login again.\n\nA: Here is what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open keychain access\n\n*Run the Keychain first aid (⌥⌘A)\n\n*Restart mac\n\n\nI tried a couple approaches noted above and none of them worked.\n\nA: Does running the command-line version of Keychain:\nsecurity dump-keychain -d login.keychain\n\nalso fail, but with the weird message In dark wake, no UI possible?\nThen part of Mac OS is confused about whether it is asleep or not. There’s no need to reboot. Put it to sleep, wake it up, and Keychain should be fine again. This happens on my MacBook Pro sometimes: I open it to wake it, press the power button out of habit, only to turn it off as it is trying to start up, resulting in weird Keychain behaviour.\n\nA: this worked for me - open Keychain access, click the lock to lock the keychains, then unlock again!\n\nA: I suspect you are a MobileMe user?\nI had the same issues.  If you are still using/syncing MobileMe on a 10.6.8 or earlier Mac, then you're probably best to stop.  It seems that the certificates issued from Snow and Lion are not entirely compatible.\nMake a copy of your Keychain, then in Keychain Access, delete everything that has .mac or MobileMe in its name and restart.  The MobileMe certificates will be repopulated and you should be okay.\nIf that fails, then try just dragging your old Keychain into the Keychain pane of Keychain Access.  You will then have a new Keychain, separate from your Login Keychain, which will have to be unlocked for use.  Once things are working okay, you can drag the items from here into your Login Keychain.  You may find that some still will not give you permission to access.  I had one or two like this and in the end, just re-did them manually.\n\nA: I encountered this problem after an El Capitan upgrade (10.11.2). Access to this item is restricted Error 253200. Only some passwords were unobtainable. Here is what I did to solve the problem.\nIn El Capitan there is NO Keychain First Aid feature. Disk Utility can NO longer be used to Repair Disk Permissions (you can do this from the command line but is not helpful in this case). Much advice on the Internet is thus OUT OF DATE hence this note.\n\n\n*\n\n*I used Keychain Access > Preferences / General to Reset my default\nlogin keychain.\n\n*I quit Keychain Access\n\n*I  opened the ~/Library/Keychains/\n\n*I entered Time Machine\n\n*I went back to a time before the likely corruption (in my case the\n10.11.2 upgrade)\n\n*I restored the login.keychain item\n\n*I did not replace but added the file and renamed it old.keychain.\n\n*I opened it using keychain access. I could now read my old passwords.\n\n*I did have to re-enter passwords - including for Mail. Note that you\nwill need to re-enter passwords for the smtp servers too\n\n\nA: Keychain says “Access to this item is restricted”\nAs posted by Matt:  This worked for me as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*open Keychain access, click the lock to lock the keychains, then unlock again! -\n\n\nIts the simplest least potentially destructive option and I was very sceptical, but it worked. So worth a shot as it takes seconds. I'm running OS X El Capitan V 10.11.6\n\nA: On Mojave, with error code \"-25320\", the fix was to put the system to sleep and re-wake it. That's it! No reboot or permission changes necessary.\n\nA: I found that when I was in the keychain access menu and clicked on my network to open it, I got the \"access is restricted\" message when, on the far left, the \"login\" icon was highlighted. However, if, on the far left, the \"system\" icon was highlighted, I was able to retrieve my password for the network I selected. No reboot necessary. I hope this helps someone else!\n\nA: I was getting the same message.  First I tried the Keychain First Aid which found nothing wrong.  I then went to the Disk Utility and selected the Macintosh HD and ran Repair Disk Permissions, then went back to the Keychain First Aid and ran it again, still did not show anything wrong BUT, now my Keychain is working as it should.\n\nA: In my case what helped was going to the Access Control tab for that specific entry of Keychain Access and selecting Allow All Applications to access this item. Once I had set that up, it worked.\n\n", "Q: AirPlay enabled speaker disappears from iTunes I have the AirPlay enabled B&W Zeppelin Air all set up correctly on my local WiFi. However, quite often when waking my iMac from sleep it will have disappeared from the list of AirPlay devices in iTunes to stream to.\nI am not sure what the problem is. The speaker still shows up on all my other iDevices, and in iTunes I still get my AppleTV in the list of devices. I also can ping the IP address of the speaker from the computer without a problem.\nSo far the only solution for me has been restarting the computer. Just restarting iTunes does not do the trick. Disabling and re-enabling my network interface (it is connected through cable) also seems to work. However I am looking for a more elegant or permanent solution.\n\nA: This has been a common issue with the Zeppelin Air and upgrading your firmware should resolve the issue.\nHow to Upgrade the Zeppelin Air Firmware\nYou should check the firmware installed on your Zepplin Air. You can view the current firmware version on the screen of an attached iPhone and most iPods. Generally it can be found in the \"About\" section in the \"Settings\" in the iPod menu.\nThe latest firmware for your Zeppelin Air is available in the support section on the B&W website. Download the installer from their site and then follow the instructions found in the manual to upgrade the software via a USB 'B' cable.\n\nDidn't help?\nIf this does not help can you please provide the following additional pieces of information: the firmware version of the software installed on your Zeppelin Air, the version of Mac OS running on your machine(s), the version of iTunes you are currently using.\n", "Q: Ideas for reinstalling Mac OS X on a 2009 Macbook Pro whose shift key is constantly stuck down? I have a Macbook Pro 13 inch from 2009 on which I spilt gin a few months ago. As a result the shift key is constantly stuck down. \nInitially, the problem was that I couldn't start the machine up, as it automatically went into safe mode, due to it booting with shift stuck down. I could get around this by holding the CMD button and tricking it. When it's started up, I disable the keyboard via command line and use a bluetooth keyboard from there.\nNow I want to reinstall Mac OSX on it, but I can't do anything on boot; it won't boot into device selection screen or boot from CD. \nHas anyone got a crafty plan on how I could go about getting OSX reinstalled on this machine? I have a 2011 Macbook Pro at my disposal also to help the case.\nI was thinking doing a network install, but I still think that needs me to get the broken macbook into the device screen via holding a button right. Is it that correct?\n\nA: Can you get the broken Mac to start in Target mode? You achieve that by pressing T while booting, it might work with the shift key too.\nAfter that you can use the Mac as an external drive, so you can start the installation using the working MBP, pointing the installation to the broken Mac.\n\nA: If you mean the key is physically stuck down ...\nThe keys just pop off.  Try leveraging it up with a flat-head screwdriver or a rounded cutlery knife.  Once off you should be able to unstick/clean the gin. To replace, just position it and push down.  It should click into place.\n\nA: I think the easiest way to get a working OSX on your stucked Mac will be that you disassemble your hard drive, connect it to your working Mac (maybe with a external hard drive case or a USB adapter), install OSX and do your keyboard correction (disabling internal keyboard) and reattach the hard drive to the broken Mac. Maybe it is more easier to use the target mode but I haven´t used it before. \n\nA: Try an external keyboard\nif that doesn't work immediately (I believe both would be active,) consider disassembling your MB and unplugging the onboard keyboard ribbon connector.\nBut, at that point, you are close to being able to just replace the keyboard, so . . . you may want to have procured a spare that you could just swap in while you have it apart...\n", "Q: Does iPad 2 3G's GPS work without SIM card inserted?

I found How can I reinstall an application that the Mac App Store thinks is installed already? but the solution reported there didn't work for me.\nThe app doesn't exist in either /Applications or /Downloads. Do you have any idea about what I might be able to do to re-download the app?\n\nA: It sounds like you have a backup drive attached. The easiest thing is to add the backup drive to the ignored list in Spotlight preferences.\n\nA: Try the following steps in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the App Store\n\n*Eject all disks (including any .dmg files you have mounted)\n\n*Use Spotlight to search your hard drive for anything with a similar name to your application.\n\n*If you find anything related to the application in question remove those files.\n\n*Delete the file at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.appstore.plist\n\n*Delete the file at ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore/Cache.db\n\n*Delete the file at ~/Library/Cookies/com.apple.appstore.plist\n\n*Delete the file at ~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.plist\n\n*Open terminal and run this command: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\n*Logout of your computer & log back in\n\n*Reopen the Mac App Store\n\n*Try to install the application again.\n\n\nA: Might it be possible that you have some other version or backup copy on another volume lying around?

I found that the apps I have stored in iTunes take up more than 10GB of space on my computer. Since I have a 128GB SSD I'd like to tell iTunes not to backup apps. I can download them again for free, anyway. If I uncheck the Sync Apps box, I get the message:\n\nAre you sure you do not want to sync apps? All existing apps and their\n  data on the iPhone \"kPhone\" will be removed.\n\n\nA: Back up apps is probably a wrong wording as you don't want to store the apps at all on your iTunes, if I understood you correct.\nOne option could be, to disable app sync. However, all apps are then probably deleted from your device and you have to download all of the again on your device again. If your apps will be deleted from your iOS device, you also will lose all the application data. Also the application data wont be backed up then to your iTunes (but could be backed up to iCloud).\nAlthough you can redownload apps for free, you should keep in mind, that a developer (or Apple) can also remove an app from sale. It is then no longer possible to redownload the app. If you still have the app in your iTunes you still can continue to use it.\n\nA: To disable automatic backups in iTunes, type the following using Terminal.app\n\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunes AutomaticDeviceBackupsDisabled -bool true    \n\nHowever, this command disables the entire backup, not just for apps.\n", "Q: What is the cheapest way to upgrade from OS X10.4 to 10.6? I have been living in the past, and it is finally catching up to me.\nWhat is the cheapest way to upgrade from Mac OS X 10.4 to 10.6?\n\nA: Spend the 30 bucks to get the 10.6 DVD and then use it for a clean install.\nThere's no reason to buy 10.5 so you can \"upgrade\" to 10.6. The 10.6 DVD is exactly the same as all the other release DVDs.\n\nA: Well, the cheapest way to upgrade to Snow Leopard is to find someone who has a legal DVD but is no longer using it, and ask him/her to give it to you.\n(Note: IANAL and I don't know if Apple's EULA \"allows\" such transfers, but you did ask for the cheapest way, and I'm assuming that you do not want to simply use Bittorrent.)\nIf it was me, I would definitely spend the $30 to buy it from Apple.\n", "Q: Uninstalling OS Lion, and transferring photos to MacBook if full restore needed I have, stupidly, upgraded to OS Lion on both my desktop and laptop.\nI've now done a hard restore on my laptop, back to Snow Leopard, and reinstalled my photo software, which wouldn't work with Lion.\nNow I need to remove Lion from my desktop, but must save 19,000 photos first, either by transferring onto my laptop (preferred) or onto my WD 2Tb hard drive, so I can reinstall after downgrade to Snow Leopard.\nCrazy, I know, but I've never needed to do this before, so please be gentle with an upgrade novice.\n\nA: Use Time Machine to backup your entire system to your WD drive.\nOnce finished, clean restore your machine back to Snow Leopard, re-install your applications and then perform a manual drag-and-drop restore from your Time Machine drive back to your clean machine.\nThis will avoid restoring any upgraded system files, preferences or other content Lion would have upgraded at point of upgrade.\nI've recently had to perform the steps above for a family member after a misbehaving Lion upgrade (bad kernel extensions or preferences causing random shutdowns).\n", "Q: How do I use the STIX Font in Mac OS X 10.7 I just found out that Mac OS X 10.7 ships with STIX fonts (Scientific and Technical Information Exchange format).

I have a satellite Internet connection (because I have no other choice, that's why :-) which has a quota of 200 MB per day (that is not a typo).\nAs you can imagine, we can very easily go through that quota and end up severely throttled for the next 24 hours (starting when the quota is exceeded, even if the quota was only minutes from 'rolling over').\nI am trying to figure out ways to minimize usage.\nMy first thought was to use something like GlimmerBlocker on the iMac (which is our media server, so it is already on 24/7), and point all of the other devices to use it as the proxy.\nBut I am looking for other ideas as well. I do not know of many applications out there which might be of use for this.\nTechnical details of the network and devices\nOur household has 3 Macs (iMac, MacBook Air, MacBook) and 3 iOS devices (iPad 2, iPhone 3GS, iPod Touch [current gen]).\nAll of the devices except the iMac connect to the network via Wi-Fi.\n(There is no 3G coverage, so the iPhone or iPad must use the Wi-Fi network.)\nThe network is served by an AirPort Extreme 802.11n (3rd generation) which operates in 'bridge mode' connected to the satellite modem (because the modem has to be the router and DHCP server and I cannot access those controls at all).\nWhat are my options?\nI have already 'trained' myself and my family members to avoid downloading audio or video files, but even with simple web surfing it is easy to exceed 200 MB per day. A local proxy/filter like GlimmerBlocker can block ads and other cruft we can't afford to download, but that's all I can think of.\nMost of the \"bandwidth monitoring\" apps out there will not help because they do not differentiate between local (LAN) traffic and Internet traffic.\nCan anyone think of other solutions to help minimize the pain of this daily quota?\n\nA: Most of the useful stuff is proxy side, but I'd recommend disabling Flash on every machine if you've not already done it, then disabling images in browser (to do it on Safari you need to enable the Developer settings). Not the best web experience but you'll stay under your bandwidth limit. \nI'd also recommend disabling the Apple automatic software updates, they'll try slowly pull down the updates so they're ready to go. If there's a security one you need then download it on one from the Apple website and install it locally. \n\nA: I don't see why your modem has to be \"the\" DHCP server. You can simply run another NAT behind the router using your Airport Extreme. In that case the modem will have only one IP address to serve, namely your AE.\nTo solve this properly you need to control all internet traffic of your household by putting some server between your household and the modem. One way of doing that would be to use an extra USB ethernet dongle in the iMac (or if the cable modem has wifi, a separate wifi network). Then you can intercept all outbound traffic on your iMac and put a transparent proxy in place.\nThe Squid proxy for example allows you to configure it so it blocks HTTP transfers over a certain size.\nIt's not easy to set all this up under OS X, but you could run a Linux firewall distro in virtualbox on your iMac.\n\nA: I hope you remember back to the days when 200MB/day was an incredible amount to have. :-)\nThere are some simple things and then some more complicated things.\nLimit access by time of day\nFirst of all, you can block times of day for connections by MAC address (advanced settings) on the Airport Extreme base station.  This can keep machines from pulling down files, updates, etc., without your permission.\nCache data with a proxy server\nSecond, you can install a \"caching\" proxy server, such as Polipo http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/, which will allow multiple machines to access the same content, fed from your iMac instead of the Internet.  You'll need to perform the same sort of proxy chaining as you currently do with GlimmerBlocker.  You should look around for a caching proxy that offers plugins for ad blocking, etc.\nLimit your bandwidth so you cannot exceed your daily transfer limit\nThird, you could perform what is called \"rate limiting\", \"traffic shaping,\" or \"QoS\" (Quality of Service) (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping).  You can do this by installing software (http://intrarts.com/throttled.html is one I have Googled but have not used) or by purchasing a home router that offers this option and putting it between your AE base station and the satellite router.  Here's a list from CNET: http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/?filter=500563_5554972_\nWith this option, you could do some rough math to figure out, given your peak usage, how much bandwidth to allow to your network.  I don't think the software solution will work with your iMac proxy solution since people do not connect through the iMac (but the caching proxy will help) so you may have to spend $50 or so on a router and configure the allowed bandwidth.\nThis will basically cause you to treat your 200MB/day satellite connection as a 18kbps modem assuming 24 hours a day usage.  If you really only use it eight hours a day, you could have the equivalent of a 56kbps modem.  Fudge up or down based on your comfort level.  It will stink but you won't have overages, and you can always \"turn it off\" if you need to make a big download.  \nIt will also allow your entire family to download video or other media.  It will be self-correcting, in that it will be so painful to download high definition video that it won't be worth doing.\n", "Q: Finder allows rename on Exposing desktop When I press F11, It directly shows me the current-desktop of OSX.\nNow, Let me describe the issue ( which is an issue according to me ).\nStep 1) open any finder window ( for example as follows.

Always been happy with it, even if I ran into trouble when switching to Lion (see here). However, I don't know yet (help guys!) if it's linked to the NAS or not.\nIt's TimeMachine compatible, it can also act as an rsync server, supports AFP protocol as well as NFS. I don't know other brands so I will only speak for this one.\n1- and no, I don't work for Synology, I'm just a happy user :)\n\nA: The entire Promise line is solid. You'll want to look for NS models that are aimed/priced for home user / small office. None of my existing Promise drives has had any issues with Lion.\nhttp://www.promise.com\n", "Q: What tool exists to identify the RGB value of a pixel? I need to get the RGB for a pixel that is in an image. Under Windows this is easy but is there a way to do this on Mac OS X?\n\nA: You can use macOS' built-in Digital Color Meter, however there is a very important caveat:\nIf you simply use the default settings naively, the values it displays are probably not the values you are looking for. (This can be an issue for most color dropper tools).\nBy default, the Digital Color Meter displays the \"Native Values\", which sounds like the original RGB values, but it's not. \"Native Values\" actually means the values after they've been converted to the Color Profile for the current display. (The Color Profile in use is displayed at the bottom of the Digital Color Meter window.) This is usually going to be a specific Color Profile for your display. For example, my Macbook Pro is set to the \"Color LCD\" profile.\nSolution\nTo get the exact original RGB values before conversion, you need to temporarily change your System Preferences > Displays > Color > Display Profile to sRGB (which is the most common Color Space, so use sRGB unless you know otherwise). Then the Digital Color Meter's Native Values will give you the exact original RGB values that you are looking for.\nAnother alternative method for web pages is to use the browser inspector and look for the css color value directly.\n\nDetails\nYou can easily test this for yourself. Go to a web page that lists CSS web colors and their RGB values. Open the Digital Color Meter and set it to Native Values. Scan down the list of colors and compare the Digital Color Meter values with the original values. Probably most of them will not match exactly. (If they all match perfectly, then you probably have set your display to use the sRGB profile).\nWhat's happening is that the dropper can only capture the value after it's been converted to the display's Color Profile.\nYou can change Digital Color Meter to \"Display in sRGB\", but that will not always give you the exact original values. That is because it is double converting from original sRGB to display's Color Profile, then back to sRGB. Sometimes there will be rounding error and it will be off by a tiny bit.\nThe only way to guarantee the exact original is to temporarily change your display to sRGB, because then there will be no conversion at all.\nFor further reading, here is an excellent article.\n\nExample\nHere is an example using DCM on ForestGreen rgb(34, 139, 34). In the first DCM screenshot, you can see that the values are all off, because it is showing the \"Native Values\" for \"Color LCD\" profile. In the second DCM screenshot, I've changed it to \"Display in sRGB\", but one of the values is still off due to double conversion rounding error. In the third DCM screenshot, notice that I've changed my Display to use sRGB color space. Finally it gives the exact original values.\nThe second row shows what happens if I naively took the wrong rgb(40, 138, 41) values and used them. Although you can't really see the difference through human eyes, it's off. And if you repeated the process, you would keep drifting further off.\n\n\nA: I usually use DigitalColor Meter (in Utilities). As long as it's open, it gives you the RGB values of the pixel below your mouse cursor.\n\n\nA: Use the built-in app /Applications/Utilities/DigitalColor Meter. Place your mouse pointer over the pixel you want the color of, and DigitalColor Meter will show the RGB values.\n\nA: I use SpotColor (recently renamed to Hues, more info here)\n\n\nand HexPicker (which currently has a slight issue with Lion still)\n\n\nA: ColorSnapper is the best. $4.99 on the Mac App Store.  \nJust take a look at the demo video and you'll see what I mean.\n\nA: I have started relying on the Digital Color Picker plug in to extend the Mac OS X color palette. It's made by Wade from Panic.\n\nA: If you need a lighter option to DigitalColor Meter you can check out Point&Paste. It's a free open-source tool that allows you to just place the cursor on the color you want and copy it to the clipboard with a key-binding of your choice.\n\n\nA: I use GraphicConverter.  It has an optional (turns on or off in settings) RGB readout in the window frame that follows the cursor.  It also has a tool represented by an eye-dropper that copies the color value into the foreground color setting.  The eye-dropper, however, averages the colors of the pixels around the point clicked.  But the radius can be adjusted from ten pixels to one (and one would mean just the pixel clicked on).\n", "Q: Lion hangs on boot with empty progress bar and then switches off Today as I was working on my MacBook Pro, it became incredibly slow and almost impossible to work with. I spent five minutes trying to restart it from the system menu, and eventually I did.\nIt took it another ten minutes to switch off, and then I got the booting gray screen with the wheel indicator. I expected it to boot after a while, but apparently 20 minutes weren't enough.\nI had to switch it off while booting and try again. During subsequent boot attempts, I would get a gray screen with a wheel and an empty progressbar that never moves (tested—I left it for three hours).\nI inserted the Snow Leopard DVD so I could launch Disk Utility (as advised on the Internet) but it gave no effect. I still see the empty scrollbar, and worse, the MacBook turns off after a while (about 5 minutes after the start).\nWhat are my next steps?\nTo recap my observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first time I restarted the system via menu so apparently it saved the state\n\n*Second time I restarted it while booting\n\n*I do hear the chime\n\n*Then I see the spinning wheel, Apple logo and an ever empty progress bar\n\n*Now it turns off on its own after a while\n\n\nLater Update\nI tried holding D to launch diagnostics as described here. I heard the DVD slot make a sound about ten times, and then it spat out the Install DVD. I saw no diagnostics, and then it turned off again.\nHolding C with the DVD inside gives me ten minutes of the optical drive sounds as if it were stuck (to clarify, I never had problems with it before). Then it rebooted and got stuck again.\n\nA: One more thing to try:  Boot in Safe mode holding the Shift key at the startup sound.  If the internal drive is bad (failed drive or borked OS), this won't work.\nIf you have an external drive as a full bootable backup (and I hope you do), connect it a power it up. Then try booting the Mac holding the Option key, and select the external drive.\nIf you have another Mac, connect the sick Mac to it and boot the sick Mac in Target mode (hold the \"t\" at startup sound).\nIf either works, copy all critical data to the drive you are booted in.\nI agree that there is at least one hardware failure involved.\n\nA: I took it to an Apple Store and they were going to replace the hard drive but were going to do nothing about my data.  I took it to an Apple Repair Shop and they replaced the hard drive and recovered my data at no charge.  It's as if nothing ever happened.  Not sure why someone mentioned not to take it to an Apple Repair shop but I'm happy with the results.\n\nA: What I would do is make a Bootable disk drive, Just google \"How to make a mac 10.9(Or lower) disk drive and plug it in. While booting, hold the option key. the file should come up. then install the OS onto the HDD or SSD.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem with my MacBook Pro (early 2011). At one time I was able to run TechTool and attempt to repair the hard drive. This worked for a short time, but after a restart for another reason, I get the same problem.\nI'm not sure if this has anything to do with FileVault 2 as well, but I did notice that my drive (for whatever reason) was not formatted with 'Journaling' enabled. You could try checking that and also run TechTool to see if it helps.\n", "Q: Configuring SSL with Apache under Lion Following on from my previous question (which I answered myself),\nConfiguring OS X 10.7 Lion Server to serve Rails Apps via Apache\n...I'm now looking to set up SSL.\nAgain, I have the config working fine under Snow Leopard, but I want to set this up on a new i7 Mac Mini, so running Snow Leopard isn't an option.\nI'm using the named virtual host kludge described in the link answer above, but I've been unable to get SSL working.\nThe Snow Leopard config I'm basing my Lion config is included below.\nTips on configuring the equivalent under Lion would be very much appreciated.

So you wont have to connect to the computer to have files sync with your iDevice. Or you can download a movie trailer and automatically have it show up between all your movies.\nIs this possible, and if so, how?\n\nA: No. The built in player doesn't do downloads (which would also bypass the parental controls and ratings the app is intended to enforce if set). You only get the App Store to pick apps that do this (there are numerous that do this) but they store the downloads in their own \"sandbox\" - not the iTunes music store.\nThe only non-jailbroken App I know of that injects music or movies into the main \"sandboxes\" is the iTunes App Store app which doesn't really go for arbitrary movies or mp3.\nIf, however, you are jailbroken there are numerous apps that can inject music into your library.\n\n\n*\n\n*MewSeek allows for downloading music, editing tags, and injecting music.\n\n*iFile now also includes an option to add music to your library if you also have Celeste.\n\n", "Q: How do I AirDrop hidden (\"dot\") files? I'm fairly new to OS X and just started working on a Lion box at work.  I went ahead and purchased a new MBP with Lion, and am enjoying it immensely so far!\nI have tried to transfer some files from my work desktop to my MBP using AirDrop.  This works well and quickly for normal files.  When I attempt to transfer a \"dot\" (in particular my .emacs) file, upon dragging the file to the AirDrop icon for my MBP there is a white circle with a line through it indicating this is not allowed.\nIs this intended behavior?  Is there a workaround that allows AirDropping of \"dot\" files?\nTo enable seeing hidden files in Finder, I did the following if it makes any difference:\n$ defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\n\nA: There are a few restrictions with .files, mainly because they are usually files important to the system. For example, aside from being hidden by default you can't rename a normal file to \".file\" (You will get a system alert, I'm pretty sure), nor you can rename a \".file\" directly from any Finder window, like most other files: you need to \"Get Info\", and rename it from there.\nOne plausible solution I can think of is perhaps renaming it before you send it, though if you want to avoid this (because they are sensitive files after all) you can compress it and then rename the zip file you get. Simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Control click on the file and select \"Compress ...\"\n\n*Control click the zip file and select \"Get Info\"\n\n*Under \"Name and extension\" you should be able to change the name of\nthe file. Simply remove the period.\n\n\nI know its kind of a log workaround, but its the best I could find. :/ Hope it helps though!\n\nA: I moved all hidden (.prefixed) files into a new directory that was not hidden, then transferred them all via airdrop.  All hidden files nested in the top directory were successfully transferred.\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro 3,1 uneven startup behavior - sometimes start between 5min to 30min after pushing power button First of all, my Mac Book Pro won't start up after going to sleep mode - all black screen etc. When I choose power down from the menu, well, it doesn't power down completely. The hard drive is still running. Only when I hold down the power button will it power down properly. When I try to boot, the Mac book simply won't turn on; nothing happens until I keep pushing and pushing several times then it turns on, but there is no pattern to how many times I have to push the button. The super strange thing is that it sometimes turns on after a good while, say anything from between 5 min - 30m - 1 hour AFTER I've pushed the power button. And the Mac Book prior to that has no sign of being in sleep mode or anything at all, no heat or anything - just cold and dead. Then I turn my back and then as if nothing has happened it boots up!? I've tried several routines like taking off the power cord, dropping the battery, then holding down the power button for several seconds before then applying the power cord and again putting in the battery, etc. Sometimes this has an effect, sometimes not. Sometimes it seems it helps to take off the powercord immediately after pushing the power button several times, but maybe it's just luck. It also seems that my right USB is recognising devices slower than before and sometimes not at all. My left usb is dead.\n\nA: Once you've gotten your backup - get into Disk Utility and try to repair the disk / consider an erase install. It will likely fail (unless the delay was caused by a very unlikely file system corruption or startup conflict).\nDropping a clean install - only the OS will let you know right away if the Hard Drive (HDD) can take new data or if other hardware issues are causing the half hour delay. Something fairly destructive is needed to cause a mac to take that long to successfully boot. Take it to a hardware tech if you have any doubts how to troubleshoot this, but odds are it's storage related.\n", "Q: How Do You Change The Default Genre Artwork in iTunes? If you look at the album art for \"Alternative Rock\" and \"Electronica,\" iTunes automatically puts up default album artwork and for specific cases, like \"Acoustic Rock,\" it uses the album art of the music artist.\nHow can I change the album artwork to something I want then? \nFor example, I would change the default album artwork for \"Alternative Rock\" to an image different from \"Alternative\" music, etc.\n\n\nA: Doing it manually:\nYou can also place your genre image in /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/Resources (shift+cmd+G and paste this path to open it directly) and add your genre in genres.plist file.

I want to know if deleted devices from the Developer Portal are reallocated. After deleting a device, I can use that spot to allocate it to a new one?\nI have read in \nProgram Renewals\n\nYes. You are allowed to assign up to 100 devices for testing and Ad Hoc distribution per membership year. At that start of a new membership year, Team Agents and Team Admins can remove devices and restore the available device count for their development team to 100 devices. When Team Agents or Admins first log into the iOS Provisioning Portal at the start of a new membership year, they will be presented with the option to remove devices and restore the device count for those removed devices. Important Note : Devices can be removed and their device count restored only up until the first new device is added. Therefore, it is important to remove all devices you are no longer using for development prior to adding any new devices.\n\nBut as I understand this is after renewal?\nI have deleted a device for testing in my account, but havent seen the number of available devices update?\n\nA: Each year when you renew your program membership you can remove devices added in previous years.  So if you had 100 devices allocated, you could delete 5 and add 5 new devices.\nAs soon as you add a new device, you can no longer remove devices for the remainder of that year.\nSo what they are telling you is each year, after renewal, delete any devices you need to remove first.

Doing it manually I have a Terminal window displaying the requests coming in and enabling me to Ctrl+C to end the webserver.\nThe Automator workflow is silent and I have to open Activity Monitor and quit Python to close it.  Is there a way to have it run the script in a Terminal window?\n\nA: Figured out how to do it myself based upon adapting the following article.\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050827164648766\nAdded a line in to run the python command:\non run {input, parameters}\n  tell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    if (the (count of the window) = 0) or ¬\n     (the busy of window 1  = true) then\n      tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"n\" using command down\n      end tell\n    end if\n    do script \"cd \\\"\" & (POSIX path of ¬\n     (input as string)) & \"\\\"\" in window 1\n    do script \"python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\" in window 1\n  end tell\n  return input\nend run\n\n\nA: If you like using Automator try the Growl Notifier in Automator (below is an example). Growl is extensible to almost any application/script/service on OS X. It works really well for showing output for just about anything imaginable.\n\n", "Q: How Do You Label The 3D Axis in Grapher? I want to label each axis with an x, y, and z. I know it's possible to label x and y axes in 2D view, but for some reason, I can't do it in 3D view. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Another helpful method that I've found was to save a standard 3-d template with colored unit vectors for the positive xyz-axis. I made the positive x-axis red, the positive y-axis blue, and the positive z-axis green. \n\nA: It appears as though it's impossible to actually label them in 3D view. Although this probably wasn't the answer you were looking for, there is a workaround.\nThe reason you can't actually label the graphs:\n\nLabels can not easily be added to 3D graphs because the text would have to be rotated through three dimensions with the graph itself (Apple explained this as difficult to write the code for).\n\nSo, a workaround for this:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Save as a pdf\n  \n*Open the graph and then copy it.\n  \n*Paste into a word document\n  \n*Add any text where you need it with text boxes, label axis.\n  \n\nIf you'd like to see the original copy of the above information, you can find it here.\n\nA: Note: If you want to quickly know what axis is what without labeling realize that the z axis will always be above the \"horizon.\"  Now use the Right hand rule with the thumb pointing to z (above the horizon).  Your fingers should curl from pointing to the X to the y axis.  Look up \"right hand rule\" for a picture.\n", "Q: How do I diagnose a slow login?

What you need to do is run repair permissions on your user folder which you cannot do with Disk Utility's \"Repair Permissions\" option. Using Disk Utility only repairs system files.\nTo repair user file permissions you would need to boot into Lion's built Repair Utilities.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off your computer\n\n*Power on your computer and press and hold Command + R until you see the Apple Logo. This may take little longer than usual to load.\n\n*Once the Repair Utilities loads, click on Utilities on the menu bar and select Terminal\n\n*Within Terminal, type resetpassword and hit Return. This will open up a password reset utility\n\n*In this window, select your hard drive (Macintosh HD) and then select your user account from the drop down menu located just underneath your hard drive's icon\n\n*With your username selected, click on the Reset button at the bottom right of the window. This process may take a couple of minutes to complete. This will repair all file and folder permissions for all files and folders located within your User Folder.\n\n*Once completed, quit the Reset Password application then the Terminal application, and finally, the Utilities application which will reboot your computer.\n\n\nSource: Repair User Permissions in Mac OS X Lion\nIf your disk is encrypted you have to unlock it first:\n\n\n*\n\n*diskutil coreStorage list will give you the UUID.\n\n*diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume YOUR_UUID will unlock the disk (the passphrase is the password for your user account)\n\n\nA: Some next steps to isolate the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does a new account take the same 10 seconds to load. Be sure to discount the first log in as the system has to populate many preference and cache files the first log in. By logging out and back in to the test account you can see what your current mac has for speed on a thin user. Do turn off automatic log in and reboot the mac to re-test a log in to the test account when the files are not cached in RAM.\n\n*Take your home folder to another mac and verify it's fine there, delete and migrate it back. This often fixes problem accounts where I can't just nuke it and have the user set it up again.\n\n*Erase the Mac after ensuring your Time Machine (or other) backup is properly updated.\n\n", "Q: Automatic network location in Lion I'm looking for a Lion compatible application similar to AirportLocation that will automatically change the Network Location based on my current location.\nIt's becoming a bigger and bigger pain to change it every day, manually.

I have the new Mac Mini with Mac OS X, with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5, with 2 GB of DDR3 memory at 1333 MHz, and a graphic card (Intel HD Graphics 3000 288 MB) that uses shared memory; the screen I am using has a resolution of 1600x900.\nPeriodically, Safari keeps freezing, and becoming unresponsive; all I can do is using Finder to force quitting it.\nI am wondering if the memory I have (with the configuration I reported) is not sufficient, or it is simply a problem with Safari that can be resolved changing some of its settings. Which one is it?\n\nA: If it's Safari 5.1 you're in the same boat as a lot of people. The recommended suggestion is bail out and go to Chrome, but I like Safari so I've stuck with it. I've completely removed Flash from my system (I sandbox it in Chrome), I trash Safari's cache once a week, I completely shut Safari once every 4 hours, and I never have more than 10 tabs open at once. That keeps it relatively stable, but I'm probably going to move to Chrome as it's a bit much for one app.\n", "Q: Is Apple throttling web apps on iPhone? According to the Register Apple is throttling web apps:\n\nIf a web app is run from the iOS 4.3 home screen – in other words, if\n  it is saved to the screen alongside local apps downloaded from the\n  Apple App Store – and launched into full-screen mode, it runs roughly\n  two to two and a half times slower than it does in the browser,\n  according to various tests. It appears that whereas Apple has updated\n  the iOS 4.3 Safari browser with its high-speed Nitro JavaScript\n  engine, Nitro is not used when web apps are launched from the home\n  screen.\n\nIs this true?\n\nA: It's more that Safari was being boosted in 4.3 and that that boost was not available to Web Apps on the homescreen\nAccording to ArsTechnica this is fixed in iOS 5.\n", "Q: Adobe Creative Suite CS5 - One License Multiple Macs As freelance web designer I have a total of four macs. I have an office I use during the day with an iMac and MacBook for taking to client meetings. And I also have a iMac and MacBook at home for generally personal use.\nI have bought licenses for Coda, Postbox and a few other programs that I use and they work across all four macs but I would like to do the same with Adobe Creative Suite CS5.\nI know the simple answer is buy more than one license but at the price they are that would be very expensive. I understand that using it on more than computer may break terms of the EULA? My question is will it even activate on more than one computer or is this impossible?\nAny advice or guidance would be much appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: Adobe's answer will be:\n\nQ: Can I distribute a Creative Suite 5.5 edition across multiple\n  users or computers?\nA:The software license agreement accompanying your product may\n  entitle you to install and activate the software on two systems with\n  certain restrictions.  The product license agreement for suite\n  editions does not allow you to install the individual components of a\n  single suite edition across multiple computers. Read the software\n  license agreement for more information. Subscription editions follow\n  the same license agreement terms.\n\nWith that in mind you will need two licenses for the products you use, you may not need the entire creative suite on each computer and find it cheaper to purchase licenses for individual apps.\nIf you buy apps from the Apple App Store you can install those apps on any computer that you use the same Apple ID with. Adobe has yet to move their apps to the App Store, but I suspect they will at some point.\n\nA: You can activate CS on 2 different computers. You can however install it on more than 2 computers and (de)activate on an as-needed basis, given that only 2 installations are activated at any given time. To deactivate, go to the Help menu of one of the CS applications.\n\nA: Why don't you email Adobe and ask them to give you an additional license key, explaining your situation.  I've heard of other software vendors doing similar things such as Ableton\n", "Q: Lock screen with LaunchBar I extensively use Launchbar and have almost all my daily productivity items working through it.\nSince I use my personal MacBook at work, I do not have use a screen saver password, however, when at work, when I leave my desk, I use the Lock Screen feature of Keychain to lock my machine. When at home it hardly ever gets locked, so putting a password on the screensaver is really not useful to me.\nI have searched far and wide, but can't seem to find a way to have Launchbar emulate the Lock Screen feature of the Keychain. \nAny suggestions on how this can be achieved using Launchbar? \nI would also be happy if someone can just provide me with guidance on an AppleScript that can achieve my goal?\nSolution\nbmike gave a very usable solution, however I ended up purchasing Lock Screen 2 from the App Store which allows you to set a hotkey to lock your screen among other options.\n\nA: First you need a script. There are countless ways to script things, based on individual skills and knowledge of AppleScript or other languages. For simplicity, let's use automator. \nYou will want to use the Watch Me Do action to show Automator how to trigger the menu item to lock the screen.\n\nI made this a service, since I like to use FastScripts for something like this. Launchbar will find your service as the top hit if you name it LockScreen as I did in this example when saving from Automator.\n(You can make an Application and store it in Apps, but services seem more light weight to me and perhaps a little faster...)\nTo start, click the record button at the top. Once the screen locks and you get back in, do edit down the action - you can get rid of the \"ScreenSaverEngine\" task if recorded you getting back in before you stopped the \"recording\"\nI moved the Playback speed to the max. I also told automator that this service receives \"no input\" just under the record button.\nHere is what you should have after saving your new service. Pay attention to the requirements of the Watch Me Do action in the lower left if you have any problems with training your mac to sing itself a short lullaby.\n\n\nA: In AppleScript:\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\"\n\nThis doesn't require you to keep the menu bar item.\n\nA: A simpler version is here: http://www.harukizaemon.com/2008/02/lock-your-screen-with-launchbar.html\nRepeating it (with an update for LaunchBar 5):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the the Script Editor, /Applications/AppleScript/Script Editor\n\n*Enter the text activate application \"ScreenSaverEngine\"\n\n*Save it to ~/Library/Scripts/Lock Screen\n\n*Open the LaunchBar\n\n*Press ⌘⌥I\n\n*Select \"Actions\"\n\n*Click \"Options\"\n\n*Check \"~/Library/Scripts/\"\n\n*Click \"Index\"\n\n*Click \"Update\" to make sure your index is up-to-date.\n\n*Close, saying yes to save.\n\n", "Q: Sync iPad on a different device I would like to stop syncing my iPad with my MBP & start syncing it with my iMac instead; when one connects an iOS device with a machine other than the one they previously synced with they get a message saying that they should erase & sync their device. Is there a way to sync my device to my iMac without erasing all my data first; PS. the MCP & the iMac share the same library. \n\nA: I tried many different approaches but none of them worked, had to erase & sync\n\nA: If the two libraries are really the same, throw away the iOS backups and iTunes folder on the \"new\" mac and just move the two folders from the old mac to the new one when iTunes isn't running.\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes: How to move your music to a new computer - move ~/Music/iTunes and optionally your iTunes Media folder if it's not embedded \n\n*iPhone and iPod touch: About backups - move ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n\n\nIf they're not the same, use Home Sharing or whatever other method makes sense to get things corrected or transfer purchases through iOS. You can export the library to XML to get playlists, ratings, play counts and such over. Artwork can get lost if you just move the files and not the whole database structure.\nWhat primarily matters is the iTunes backups and settings stored in the database, not whether the music or media files are shared or identical - as long as the songs to be synced are equivalent.\n", "Q: Why is my RAM nearly fully used? I bought a Macbook Pro 15 inches 3 months ago. It's running on Mac OS X Snow Leopard and it has 4GB of RAM.\nI consider having a fair use of this computer :\n- surfing (Chrome)\n- developing (Fraise)\n- gaming\nBut after some hours of use, here is what happens :\n\nIt's in french but you can easily see that only some tens of MB (Mo) are still available, whereas the sum of all launched processes is far to reach 4GB...  \nSo where the hell did my RAM go ?\n\nA: There's more memory available there than you think. \"Inactive\" memory is memory that has been used, and is essentially keeping its old data so that it can be swiftly grabbed again if needs be. However, if your computer needs the memory for some new process, that memory is capable of being used - the old data is dropped out, and new data is put in.\nAs others have said, you also need to show all processes for a full idea of what's going on with your memory. But you're not nearly as tapped out as it first appears.\n\nA: You are displaying only your processes 'Mes opérations'. You can switch to 'All processes' to see what is using the remaining part of the memory.\n\nA: Unix-like kernels automatically take almost all available memory for the page cache.  The page cache is essentially a copy of portions of your hard drive present on DRAM.  This greatly improves performance.  As your applications require more memory, the kernel will quickly decrease the size of the page cache to give the applications more room.\n", "Q: Can I uninstall stock Apple applications (e.g. Stickies) Is it safe to uninstall stock OS X applications that I do not use?  They're really just taking up space on my Applications list (and my SSD).  The applications I'm eyeing for deletion are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Front Row\n\n*iDVD\n\n*Image Capture\n\n*iMovie\n\n*Mail\n\n*Photo Booth\n\n*Stickies\n\n*Textedit\n\n\nDoes OS X malfunction if these stock applications are uninstalled?\n\nA: Yes, technically, you can, but you shouldn't.\nReasons you shouldn't:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple will sometimes update the applications in minor OS upgrades. As the rest of the application isn't there, you end up with only the files that were changed. \n\n*What if you decide you need them in the future? You'll have to reinstall the OS.\n\n*On Snow Leopard and later, the apps you mention take up almost no space - Mail is a measly 77 megs.\n\n\nIf you do decide to delete them, it's easy: drag them to the Trash or hit Command-delete just like any other file. Do make a backup before you delete things, and do also test the apps you delete or trim right away. You want the Mac to crash now while you remember what you deleted.\nBe hesitant to delete Image Capture or TextEdit. The former controls scanning and importing pictures from any device and the latter is called for in some cases if you need to edit a system file. I'd also say leave Mail around - especially if you ever will set up a guest account and let someone use your Mac for a short amount of time.\nYou probably won't hose up too much with the rest. I should mention again that this is very much discouraged because it breaks the system that tracks what software was installed. Software installed by Apple gets recorded in a receipts database, and these receipts don't contemplate a partial uninstallation and you are gambling that there isn't a connection between these apps and others you may need later.\nWhy not look elsewhere to save some space? You can and should look in /Library/Application Support and delete some of the iDVD loops and Audio Loops for GarageBand. Also, compare the size of all the apps you intend to clean out and compare it to one music video or a few songs in iTunes. You probably can find much better targets to free up substantial space rather than getting rid of some essential system utilities that take up little to no space in reality.\n\nA: They're really just taking up space on my Applications list...\nOn a 27\" monitor there is room in Finder for 60 apps without scrolling, of those around 25 (almost half) are non-removable Apple applications.\nOne workaround to keep the list manageable is to create a subfolder called MoreApps for all your Third party applications.\nYou can then drag the MoreApps folder onto the finder sidebar for quick access.\n\nA: Yes you can. \nI suggest using AppCleaner\n\nA: If you're trying to save space by deleting these; don't. It's hardly any space and who knows what any possible complications might be. A few harmless ways to slim down the size of applications on you're boot drive.\nMonolingual is a free application that let's you delete unused language support and architectures. Since most apps are still \"universal,\" you'll find that just by deleting the powerPC version of the code you'll save between 1-4GB, plus around 500Mb from the language packs.\n", "Q: Can I use Macbook Pro as a wireless router? The only internet connection point in my current apartment is PPPoE service(via cable). I can plug it into my Macbook Pro to get internet connection. The problem is how to bring the internet connection to my iPad. Is it possible to configure my Macbook Pro as a wireless rounter for my iPad?\nOr, if I have a separate wireless router with the PPPoE cable plugged in, how can I get it to work?\n\nA: Try this...\nSharing your Internet connection - http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/8156.html\nYour mac will basically create a WiFi network for the iPad to join and then it will share traffic from the ethernet connector/PPPoE/cable.\nYour mac's buit in help might be newer than the link I provided, so check there first. Also, be sure you turn off any firewalls if you don't know how or what holes to poke in them. You may be less secure, but it's a bit harder to set up the firewall on one interface and not the other.\n", "Q: Gmail Draft emails do not sync properly between Apple Mail.app (on Mac) and iPad My Gmail drafts are not syncing properly between Apple's Mail.app (on the Mac) and the Mail app on the iPad. What is the proper way to set up drafts so that they sync properly?\n\nA: First - you'll want to set up two draft messages. One on the iPad and check using a gmail web interface if it's really storing the drafts properly to gmail. The iOS uses exchange active sync, but that shouldn't matter to you - either the iPad is storing it to the server (as viewed through mobile safari or any other web interface to gmail) or it isn't.\nRepeat for Mail.app on the OS X. Here, you have more control (and more opportunity to set it up improperly).\nThe main item that would cause issues is if mail thinks it's not supposed to store drafts on the server. See the Accounts preference for your gmail account.\n\nFrom there, you'll have to use the help menu to look into how to manually synchronize or run the connection doctor to see if/why mail isn't able to store drafts as directed. The last resort would be to hit up the google support link provided at the bottom of the mail account pane. Hopefully, you can suss it out with these tips.\n", "Q: iBooks alternate language dictionaries? Is there any way to change the dictionary used in iBooks? When reading books written in a non-English language I would like to have access to the dictionary function in the book's language (not translation, just dictionary lookup).  Currently I'm reading Don Quijote in Spanish, and it would be really helpful to be able to lookup unfamiliar words.\n\nA: This has changed in iOS7. Look up a word, at the definition UI push \"Manage\" in the bottom left, and a list of foreign dictionaries comes up:\nEnglish, Apple, Oxford-EN, Spanish, Korean, KOR-EN, JP-EN, Italian, German, French, Dutch, Simplified CN, SCN-EN, and Japanese.\nAny & all can be downloaded from inside this \"Manage\" screen, and the definitions will trail (as things do on the OSX side with Dictionary.app).\n\nA: No, it's not possible yet, only English and Japanese as provided by Apple.  Extra dictionaries are available from 3rd parties for the OS X version of Dictionary.app, but Apple does not provide any way to add these in the iOS version so far.\n", "Q: How can I add static route? How can I add a static route \"forever\", that means without retyping add route in Terminal each time I'm using VPN? I found this solution for 10.6, but what if there is a nicer one for 10.7?\n\nA: I would use Lingon to script this as a system startup - you can always use launchd to load or unload the job from the command line (or delete the route).\nYou don't need Lingon, it just makes it so much more friendly to assemble a plist that launchd likes to run.\n", "Q: Installing gnuplot (or similar) on Lion All the packages needed to install gnuplot through MacPorts on Lion succeed, except for aquaterm.\nInstalling gnuplot through Fink is far less lucky on Lion. Fink bails out after only a third of the packages needed for gnuplot have been installed, but Fink does install aquaterm.\nIs there a way to 'port install gnuplot' while pointing MacPorts to the aquaterm installation generated by Fink?\nAlso nice would be to know of a method to install gnuplot on Lion that uses neither Fink nor MacPorts. Learning about a replacement for gnuplot itself on OSX would be handy.\n\nA: I used Homebrew to install gnuplot. I believe I had to use specify --nolua. First, I installed aqua term:\nbrew install aquaterm. Then I installed gnuplot with brew install gnuplot --nolua and that was it, gnuplot picked up aquaterm immediately.\nAdditionally, I sometimes use octave to plot. It's also got a formula in Homebrew, so just run brew install octave and away you go!\n\nA: Download Maxima. It contains a working Gnuplot.app for Lion.\n", "Q: Scrambled screen when going out of sleep With my 2011 MBP, when connected to my external screen I always encounter an issue when waking up from sleep mode, if the lid was closed (and only if lid is closed from what my tests show).\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*MBP + External screen + Lid closed\nWake-up with scrambled external screen and black MBP screen. MBP frozen.\n\n*MBP + External screen + Lid not closed\nWake-up normally from sleep mode.\n\n*MBP without external screen (lid closed or not)\nWake-up normally from sleep mode.\n\n\nDo you have any idea of what could cause this and how I could fix the issue?  \nHere is how my external screen looks like after a wake-up in the first case:  \n\nI've seen this issue but it's for older version of MBP and my system is up to date regarding the Software Update option.\n\nEdit: Last EFI update installed yesterday seems to have fixed the issue!\n\nLast update:\nSeveral years without any issue and then, recently, having really serious issues appearing (MBP freezing or rebooting (console showing gpuRestart crash logs)), I went to the Apple Store.\nThey changed the GPU (hence the full motherboard). This was free because of an extended repair program for this very specific problem. See details here. Program ends in Feb 2016, so hurry up in case you have the same issue!\n\nA: Although it's likely a hardware issue, you could try a few things if you don't want to get hardware help from Apple yet.\n\n\n*\n\n*See if this happens when booting in Safe Mode.\n\n*Install a clean OS on an external drive to be sure it's not some extension or conflict.\n\n*Look in the console logs - see if you can see any obvious errors.\n\n*Try with other monitors and cables - it could be a bad cable or display. An EFI or firmware update might be needed to make the mac handle this situation better (it should never freeze) - and a report to Apple with details how to reproduce this might help get a fix sooner unless others have reported this specific combination.\n\n*If you have alternate RAM - do try swapping that in for testing. The newest macs use RAM heavily for display buffering - and wake from sleep is a time when you first can see issues with RAM going bad.\n\n\nI'm lucky to have stores close by and would head there for a diagnostic checkup - so keep that in mind - it could just be a hardware failure / bad RAM, but anything you can do to narrow down the cause or rule out software / accessories by disconnecting everything but the bare minimum could save you a trip to the shop.\n", "Q: Why is mdfind only returning my most recently accessed files? I've imported most of a javascript code base via mdimport (using the packaged SourceCode.mdimporter provided by Xcode) and it succeeds. However, mdfind only ever returns to me at most two results, those being the two most recently accessed files. For example, if files A, B and C all contain the substring \"term\", mdfind \"term\" would show only A and B. If I then opened file C, the subsequent call of mdfind would only show B and C. How do I get mdfind to return to me all files containing my term?\n\nA: When I performed a test for a term contained in three files, it showed all the files when running the mdfind command. I would recommend rebuilding your spotlight index on the current folder/s you are in and see if that fixes it.  To rebuild your spotlight index: Spotlight: How to re-index folders or volumes \n", "Q: How do I sync Gmail contacts with my iMac's address book and my iPhone? I enable the sync with Google inside the preferences of address book on snow leopard but I don't know how to set the time between the syncing and how to force to update. I added a new contact to gmail from the web browser now I eed this contact in the iPhone and on the iMac too.\nBefore Lion there was iSync which stay in the status bar and keep update my contacts every time I wanted, but now with Lion it's gone!\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: When I had Snow Leopard I had the Google address book sync enabled and I somehow managed to put a 'sync' icon in the menu bar.\nIf I remember correctly I added it from the \"old\" iSync application (unsuccessfully trying to sync with a Samsung phone).\nNow in Lion I still have it and it allows me to manually force the update of my Google address book, but I can't find how to obtain it as the iSync app seems to have disappeared.\n\nThis article here describes the situation of iSync in more details\n\nA: You probably want to give this a read:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3963741?start=0&tstart=0\nThe key part would be:\n\nFor AB to send new info immediately (not knowing the time interval), quit AB and restart it. It should update all info. If not, uncheck the sync option in AB prefs, the recheck and reinput the username and password. That should create an immediate sync.\n\n\nA: I sync between mac, iphone and gmail (I have google apps for our company, so we can share contacts etc). \nThe best way to do it is through iTunes as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your phone.\n\n*When iTunes pops up, click the info tab.\n\n*Make sure \"Sync Address book contacts\" is selected\n\n*Click \"Sync with Google\"\n\n*Click Configure and enter your gmail username and pass.\n\n\nThat's it. Now whenever your phone syncs (settings you can further control, but not really for this post), your contacts will sync with both google and your address book.\n", "Q: On iPad, how to organize Shows in a native Video player app On a computer, in iTunes I add a number of video files that I group by marking them as TV Shows. The shows, in turn, have files grouped into seasons.\nWhen I transfer files to an iPad, I only see the Season number in the native Video app. It would be logical to at least show a show name and a season number. So if I add two different shows to an iPad, and both of them have season 1, the in Video app on the device I get two Season 1 enters on the initial screen. I can only see the name of the show if I select one of these \"season 1\" entries.\nSo my question is: is there a way for me to group files in ipda, so that I get a name of the group displayed? It doesnt necceseraly has to be shows, as long as there is grouping.\n\nA: I figured out that I can't get the name of the show to come up in iPad's show list. The only way to differentiate is to get a readable album art with the show name and apply it to all seasons. This way I know what show I am clicking, as well as what season. \n", "Q: Why is my Time Machine backup failing to fire at the hourly interval? At some point after upgrading to Lion my Time Machine backups have stopped firing on the hourly interval.  It works manually, but not automatically.  It also works first thing in the morning when I plug the external drive into my laptop.\nI have basically gutted the Time Machine config files, launchdaemon files with no luck.  I've even reformatted my TM drive.  So far, no matter what I do, TM just never fires on the hour.  \nThe interface shows when the last backup occurred as well as when the next one is set to happen.

I saw a similar question (Can I delete the /Developer-3.2.6 or /Developer-3.2.5 folders?), but I am unclear if it would break anything. That question assumes the user is not a developer, so I was a little worried and would like to be sure before I do anything. Can I delete this folder? I updated to Xcode 4, but I am unsure if deleting this would remove things that I may need. For example, before Xcode 4 came out, I installed Xcode 3 to compile my C programs (gcc). \nRight now, there is a Developer and a Developer-3.2.5 folder, so I assume Developer is for Xcode4 stuff.\n\nA: Yes, you can absolutely delete the folder Developer-3.2.5 - it shouldn't effect your workflow in any way UNLESS you want to add an older SDK at a later date.\nIf you are interested in seeing more discussion about it, there is also an Apple Support Community thread that essentially says the same thing - that you don't need the folders.\n\nA: It should be safe to delete, if for no other reason than if something does get messed up, you can just reinstall Xcode 4.\n", "Q: Screenshot tool that uses current state of web browser? I'm looking for a screenshot tool that will snap the current page, in its current state. So if I've filled out a form, or changed the page from its default state in some way via DHTML, or I'm using AdBlock, that's what the screenshot looks like. SnagIt Pro on Windows works this way. \nBut the screen shot utilities that I've used on MacOS that do scrolling captures of full web pages all seem to send the URL of the desired page via Applescript and then snap the page using their own browser-like engine, which doesn't give me the state that I want.\nRecently I've tried Skitch (Safari only), Littlesnapper (my current tool), and a few others that I can't remember any more. I don't mind paying a reasonable amount for a good tool, so I don't need it to be free... app store is always a plus. And I like having a screenshot-only library, the way Littlesnapper does it. Really, Littlesnapper would be perfect (odd interface behavior aside) if it just snapped the current page state.\n\nA: SnagIt for Mac\nseems to do exactly what you want. I own the product. I just tested it on a web page in Safari with ad-blocking and with some text I typed into a field. It did a scrolling capture faithfully with all the ads blocked and the text still in the field.\n\nA: LittleSnapper looks to do exactly what you wish.\n\nA free alternative might be Skitch. Both are on the App Store and you can demo LittleSnapper for free as well. \nI use sketch more, so the rest of this pertains to that solution...\nAll snaps are stored in a Skitch folder in ~/Pictures and you don't have to pay to get what used to be the premium capture feature like capturing the entire browser window - even if it scrolls off the page.\nYou are correct that the \"Safari Capture\" re-renders the page, but it appears to inherit many of the cookies since it shows me still logged in here.\n\nYou could always snap the window (or frame the same size snapshot) multiple times and stitch them together if you need to make one larger capture of how your specific browser rendered a long or wide page. This stitching process requires another program as skitch only gets the snaps, you'll have to combine them elsewhere.\n\n", "Q: Password protect removal of apps on iOS I have had instances of people deleting my applications (purposedly or unpurposedly) and it's a real annoyance to get them back, plus you lose all of your data. \nIs there a way to password protect the removal of applications, maybe through the use of a Cydia tweak?\n\nA: No need for a jailbreak. Simply go into Settings>General>Restrictions and don't allow \"Deleting Apps\". Restrictions are protected using a password just like your lock passcode (although it can be a different code if you would like).\n\nA: If you have the current or a recent version of iOS such as iOS 13 or 12, you can prevent accidental app deletions by disabling all app deletions via Settings -> Screentime-> Content & Privacy Restrictions -> iTunes & App Store Purchases > Deleting Apps > Don't Allow. If you want this option to be password protected, set a password via Settings -> Screentime-> Content&Privacy Restrictions -> Use Screen Time Passcode. \n\nA: Erase and supervise the device in Apple Configurator, then enroll it in Jamf Now - first three devices are free forever.  Other MDMs are similar, but Jamf is the easiest and most developed.\nWith a supervised device, you can then enable various security settings, including disabling the ability to delete apps, among many others.  You could also use Jamf to distribute and remove free apps, or set up an Apple Business Manager account (requires a DUNS number) and manage free and paid content from the App Store and Books Store.\nIn this way, app management is password protected - but at the login to Jamf, not onboard the device.\n", "Q: Why don't .ico files created in Icon Composer work on Windows? For a couple of months now I've been creating favicons using Icon Composer (which comes with Xcode). It can save .ico files, and I know that sometimes Windows shows (or used to show) larger versions of the icon in some circumstances, so I thought I'd do it that way instead of just using a tiny .png.\nImagine my surprise when a Windows-using coworker tells me that he can't see any of the favicons I've created this way. No Windows browser seems to render them correctly, and only Firefox even attempts to render them at all.\nSo are .ico files produced by Icon Composer not supposed to be Windows-compatible? If not, is there any quick way to convert them into versions that are? If so, what might I be doing wrong?\nUPDATE: Here is an example of a broken .ico file  produced by Icon Composer. My coworkers are all on Windows 7, so it's not just a Windows XP issue.\n\nUPDATE 2: This happens with .ico files saved from both Icon Composer 2.1 (Xcode 3) and 2.2 (Xcode 4). In Firefox on Windows, display of these icons is corrupted; the icon is shifted to the right several pixels, and the right side is cut off and wraps around to the left side, as seen here:\n.\n\nA: Do you get the same issue if you try Hobiconer to export your icons? Superior to Icon Composer in every way, and free. \nThe commercial successor of Hobiconer called Icon Slate is $4.99 in the App Store, however Hobiconer is still out there for grabs (hence the link to Softpedia's mirrored file)\n\nA: What version of Icon Composer do you use?\nI will upload the icon you listed after I made it a converted ico with Xcode 4's Icon Composer.\nhttp://f.cl.ly/items/2v2R473k1N0z1D2R3R3i/badfavicon.ico\nAs noted 256x256 is what windows 7 uses for icons.\nWhat exactly are you doing that required them to be in ico format? \nIf you are making web icons would it not be easier to use a different more generic format of an image such as a png or jpeg.\nEdit: I tested my image made in the same format and in firefox on mac it decides to display the 16x16 instead of the 256x256 so maybe the browser is being selective on the sizes it presenting or it cannot process the way the ico file is built to determine the image size\nIts hard for me to assist without really knowing the reason they need to be in ico format for view in web browsers\n\nA: My suggestion is to use GIMP instead of Icon Composer. I used to fiddle with Windows icons a fair bit, and it never messed up for me. My only problems with it (on Mac OS X) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Much slower startup time compared to Icon Composer.\n\n*Can't drag-and-drop (have to use File->Open [as Layers]).\n\n", "Q: Use Macbook Pro's single audio jack for both input and output at the same time? Basically, the Macbook Pro 13inch (early 2011) has only one audio jack, but I need two.\nWhat I want to do is to plug in my electric piano (I have a male-to-male audio cable, I plug one end into the piano, the other in the microphone jack) into the computer, then play some backing track on the computer, and finally plug in headphones into the computer so that I can listen both to what I'm playing and the backing track.\nThis worked perfectly fine when I used my netbook. However, now I would like to use my macbook, but it has only one jack, so I can't plug both the piano and the headphones in.\nIs there some kind of a splitter I could use so that I can plug in both at the same time? I found some threads online, such as this one, but some of the posts seem contradictory, so I thought I'd post here.\nI would also welcome any answers that could explain the rationale Apple used for not including a second jack. Please do not use size as an argument; 10 inch netbooks fit 2 jacks just fine.\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes - the good splitters mix the pins correctly to provide mono microphone and stereo output in the same jack. You can of course get breakout boxes like the Griffin iMic and have the benefit of a cleaner D/A circuit at the expense of carrying another device that's plugged into USB. Just like everything - some of the expensive products are over priced and some of the cheap ones are worthless. I'd go with a name brand - especially if their products are carried on the Apple Online or stocked in the retail stores.\nLion does add a control where you can select the speaker icon in the menu and switch from input and output.\n\nAs to the rationale - unless an engineer from Apple steps up, we'll have to speculate.\nHere are the reasons to have fewer ports. (They're not al good, but they are reasons)\n\n\n*\n\n*Simplicity - the iPhone / iPad / iPod touch all have one port. Many people don't need or want the confusion of knowing which port they plugged in to their mac. Just as you really appreciate having two, many appreciate having only one stereo jack.\n\n*Internal simplicity - one less switch, one less moving part, several solder points.\n\n*Internal spacing is far more important than external space. If you look at iFixit's excellent take apart manual - you will see there actually isn't room on the logic board for another connector. The design would have to sacrifice an USB port or the SD card slot to make room for a second package without reducing the space for the battery. These macs are packed incredibly tightly and despite the clean appearance of excess external space, inside they are packed like proverbial sardines in a can.\n\n\nThis lack of space likely cuts features from the smaller macs like a redundant mini headphone port.\n\n\nA: It is a size issue :).  If you look at the system board vs the cavity for the battery and hard drive, you'll see they couldn't fit it.  What I'd do is get some sort of USB sound card such as these at newegg.com (just an example, not plugging newegg.com http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&Depa=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=usb%20sound%20card%20mac&IsRelated=1&cm_sp=KeywordRelated-_-usb_sound_card-_-usb%20sound%20card%20mac\n", "Q: Why is iTunes only syncing some of the pictures (seemingly randomly) in each Aperture Event to my iPad? When I sync my iPad, a random selection from each event is there after I sync. Some events seem to have all of them, some have only one (of hundreds), some have a minority percentage.\nAnd there's no rhyme or reason - it's not the first, last, edited ones, or any other category I can think of.\nI've tried rebuilding Aperture's database, turning photo syncing off, syncing, and then turning it on again, restarting, all to no avail.    \nI do get the \"some of your pictures couldn't be sync because they can't be dispayed on your iPad, but I always do, and can't fathom that's the issue - they're standard, non-giant jpegs.\nHelp?\n\nA: Well, two trips to the genius bar couldn't solve it (\"you need to start a new library from scratch and retag your 15,000 photos\" - WHAT?!?!), but I dug around and experimented and finally came up with the answer:\niTunes won't sync pictures without up-to-date previews; so, if they stop auto-generating for some reason, you have to force it to update previews for the pictures that aren't syncing.\n\n\n*\n\n*You may want to go to iTunes and select \"Sync all Photos\" and note the number of photos that appears in the upper right of the window, so you can make sure that it's higher after this process.\n\n*Go to Aperture and select \"Photos\" up near the top of your library, in order to select your whole library of pics.\n\n*In the \"Photos\" menu up top, you should see \"update previews for library\".  (If you're not seeing it, you probably skipped step 2, or selected an individual photo, in which case, it will be replaced with \"update preview\".  You want to do it for everything, so be sure to highlight \"photos\" first.\n\n*That may take some time, depending how many you were missing, but once it's done, go back to iPhoto, and uncheck \"sync all photos\" and then recheck it.  That should force it to recount the pics, and you should now see a number that matches your library (less any in a format that iTunes can't handle.)\n\n", "Q: Preload and preconfigure an iPad for someone else I need to preload and preconfigure some software on an iPad, and then give the iPad to someone else.\nI thought about just buying the software with my App Store account, but is there a way that I can \"transfer\" the ownership of the app (and the registration of the iPad itself) to the other person?\nThis is similar to Is it possible to pre-install apps on an iPad? except that I can activate the device first, and I want to do more than just install an app, I want to be able to pre-configure everything and then (I suppose) transfer the app to the other person.\n\nA: You can do several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convince them to permit you to use their Apple ID and password (they can change the password to something you prefer - then change it back). They can also remove the credit card and let you gift the apps or redeem a gift certificate.\n\n*Just gift them the apps and assist them as they learn.\n\n\nIn the long run, you'll either be acting as a custodian or want to be hands off - look at things six months from now and you can decide if you'll just be on the hook to support them perpetually or if you just want to be with them and let them do the setup so they are self sufficient.\n\nA: I don't believe there's any way to transfer ownership of apps already purchased. Does this person have an iTunes account already? If not, set one up and make the purchases, using a gift card, or switch the CC info when you transfer the iPad. If they already have an account, best way may be to gift the apps to the user's account (you may have to do this from iTunes on a computer).\n", "Q: What is the best way to set up Gmail on IPad? I just got an iPad and want to know, what is the best way to set up Gmail on the iPad? As far as I can tell there are three methods to set up the account:\n\n\n*\n\n*As a Gmail account\n\n*As an Exchange account\n\n*\"manually\" (I.e. you enter in all the information on the servers yourself). \n\n\nAccording to this website, manual setup allows you to store your drafts on the server, but exchange allows for push. Can someone please explain the differences between the options and the best way to set up Gmail?\n\nA: Setting up via Exchange is my preferred iOS Gmail setup. In earlier iOS versions (I think 3.0) you were limited to one Exchange account. So in my case, that was reserved for my work email. But once that limitation was lifted, I switched Gmail to Exchange and have been quite happy with it. \nYou get push email, which is the main benefit, but you also get push contact/calendar updates. Depending on if you use Google calendar as your main calendar, push calendar updates and invites can be a huge help to managing one's day. \nIf you decide you don't need push while using Exchange (or ActiveSync, which is the specific mobile protocol used by Exchange and Google), disabling push is quick and simple. Setting up via ActiveSync also saves a few steps in that you don't have to link your calendar and contacts manually.  So I say go for Exchange, even if you don't use push. But it's not a huge deal either way, and as it's so easy to add/remove accounts on iOS, if you pick one and don't like how it works out, you can always switch to the other with minimal effort. \n\nA: The big advantage of Exchange account is push as you mentioned already. That will also get you synced contacts and calendars if you don't disable those options in the account settings on your iPad. Gmail contact sync can be a little wonky at times, so be careful about that one or it's possible in some cases to end up with a ton of contacts for anyone who's ever emailed your Gmail account. Worth noting that push can negatively affect your battery life, but I'm not sure if there's any great data on that - generally I don't think it's a substantial hit.\nThe advantage to doing it via the standard Gmail option (which is just IMAP) is simplicity. Doing it that way generally gets things set up the way they should. You get an archive option in place of \"delete\". You can still add your Google calendars separately via CalDAV if you're inclined to do so.\nManually will just get you the same results as the \"Gmail\" account option, possibly without the archive option, I haven't tested. No real reason to do this unless you really want practice typing server addresses in.\nI don't think there's really a \"best\" way, but if you want push or contacts, I'd say go with Exchange, otherwise just keep it simple and use the standard Gmail option.\n", "Q: Enable home directory sites in Lion server?

Some background: I have my screen saver turned off. I have Energy Star set to never put the computer or the display to sleep. I generally Switch out to the Login Dialog and turn my monitor off because often times I remote into this computer and it freaks family members out when they see a computer operating by themselves...\nOn to the issue. Occasionally, when I turn my monitor back on, I see a dark screen with the remnants of the Flurry screen saver drawn to the screen. Note, it's frozen and nothing is responding. Often times, I can use the Eject button on my keyboard to \"shock\" the system into responding and it brings up the Login Dialog and I can continue as normal. However, sometimes, even this trick doesn't work. Then, what I have to do is use my laptop to ssh into my MacPro and sudo kill -9 the process for\nroot     12856   0.0  0.0  2476680   2420   ??  S     5:18PM   0:00.08 /System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgent.app/Contents/Resources/authorizationhost\n\nWhich then clears the dead Flurry screen saver image and brings up the Login Dialog and again, everything works as normal. \nSo, does anyone else have this situation? Do they have a better way to fix it so that this problem doesn't happen?\nNote: I am using Mac OS X 10.6.8. Alternatively, if someone had this problem and upgraded to 10.7, was the problem fixed?\n\nA: It seems that the cable from the monitor to the power box wasn't fully connected. I noticed this a few days ago and made sure the cable was fully connected and I haven't had my issue since. At this point, it's just anecdotal evidence, but I wanted to log the answer in case others were having the same issue. Make sure your cables are fully connected!\nUPDATE I received a new monitor for the holidays but it forced me to purchase a new monitor card, one that could handle Mini DisplayPort. Now that I have swapped out the monitor card, this problem is not happening anymore. So it seems it was related to the hardware, but more likely the card had some issue that was causing the problem.\n", "Q: Re-appearing folder in OS X Lion At some point in the past, I had a folder on my desktop that I placed temporary music files off of my Aunt's iPod. I imported the files from her old school iPod in order to add to her iTunes library and import to her iPhone.\nThis specific path to the folder was ~/Desktop/Jean.\nI deleted this folder and emptied the trash, but 9 times out of 10, after I login after restarting my computer, the folder named Jean has reappeared on my desktop. I have no idea why this would be the case, what would be causing it, or how to make it stop occurring.\nAnybody know?\ninfo: I am running OSX 10.7.1.\n\nA: Did you use an application to get those files off the iPod? If so, did that application create a folder to export the files to? \n\nA: BE VERY CAREFUL in following my instructions as below.  There is potential for seriously screwing up your system if anything gets mis-typed.  Which implies the following:  backup before you do any of this!\nEmpty your trash, then open a terminal session (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app), and very carefully, type the following:\nsudo rm -rf ~/Desktop/Jean\n\nThen:\ncd ~/.Trash/\nls -al\n\n(If you get any output, then these are the things that are in your trash.)\nsudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/*\n\nAnd restart.  Let us know if the folder comes back.  The rm command removes stuff, the -rf flags indicate a forced removal (f) and recursive, in order to remove folders (r).\n\nA: I figured out the cause of my issue. I have the application PhotoSync, which was configured to sync to that particular folder. On startup it was checking that the folder existed, and when it didn't, it was creating it. Changed the default location, and its all good now. Thanks for the help guys, I +1ed everybody's response.\n", "Q: SIMBL Plugins not launching properly under OS X Lion I have OS X Lion installed on my 2011 MacBook Pro. I also have SIMBL with two plugins: Colorful Sidebar and Safari Omnibar. I (obviously) have Finder launch when I login, and I also have Safari launch at login.\nMy issue is that when I first use either application, the desired effect of the application does not kick in. i.e. the icons in Finder's sidebar are still gray, and the google search box can still be found as a separate entity in safari.\nRestarting either application causes the SIMBL plugin to kick in for that application.\nMy question is why are these plugins not activating and doing what they are supposed to do until after I relaunch their respective application?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is the behaviour of the SIMBL plugin.\n\nOne oddity about this solution is that you may need to kill the Finder\n  again to bring the color icons back after a full system reboot\n\nSource\n\nA: On the Omnibar page's FAQ they say that it is known issue and it is suggested to reinstall Omnibar since newer versions are shipped with patched SIMBL.\nSee the third question from the bottom of this page.\n\nA: The plugins will not activate by themselves. They activate when the app is launched, as an intended accessory to the app.\nI do not know what to do about Safari Omnibar, but I have an Applescript someone compiled that runs on login.  It  shuts down the Finder and relaunches it immediately after the Finder is active at startup, giving me thee Colorful Finder window.\nI would imagine that the Applescript could be modified to do the sam for Safari Omnibar, but I am not a scripter.\nI just searched for the source of this script to provide the link, but failed.  Being new here, I don't know the protocol about sharing this script, as it is essentially a hack.  \n\nA: Here you can find the answers \nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110825114202681\n", "Q: How does one reorganize one's entire Aperture library from scratch? I imported pictures into Aperture from iPhoto and since then, added a lot of new ones. I'd like to start over because the dates on the tags/folders in which the pictures are organized are not consistent.\nIn effect, what I'm looking for is a way to do a re-import of all pictures in my current Aperture library (not that many... just over 1,000) to have it apply its import rules/magic to have it all sorted properly.\nThat feels like a hack, though. Is there a proper way to do this?\n\nA: By default, there is not any magic when importing photos to aperture.\nProbably at that point, what it might be confusing is that Aperture has transformed your iPhoto albums to folders/projects, which are not what you exactly want.\nMy advise would be to create one project, move all your images there, delete all other projects/folders, and then create new projects as desired.\nFurthermore, you can find a lot of articles of how you may use projects/folders to organize your photographs, like this one.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean when you write that the dates/tags are not consistent after import from iPhoto. Do you mean that those attributes are wrong in the metadata? Or that you have a folder structure organized by date, and the photos are in the wrong folders (but with correct metadata)?\nIf your situation is the latter, I had a similar problem when I moved from iPhoto to Aperture. At the time I wrote a little Applescript to help me reorganize. I won't post it unless you'd like to see it, as the code is very specific to my situation and probably won't be helpful to you. But in general, my approach was this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a set of folders by year (i.e. \"2007\", \"2008\", \"2009\")\n\n*Identify a set of photographs to move (in my case the contents of a single large folder containing everything from iPhoto)\n\n*Loop over each photograph, get the date from the EXIF data, and move it into the appropriately dated folder.\n\n\nThat sounds conceptually simple, and writing the script that way is fairly straightforward since Aperture has a good scripting dictionary. Remember that Aperture has both folders and projects, which is a slightly different nomenclature from iPhoto albums. You'll need to decide how you want to use projects and folders for organization. I use projects named by Year-Month, for example, with one giant folder of Archives and one folder of Current photos.\n(I realize that I've resurrected an old discussion here, but this was a problem I've encountered just recently and I thought it would be helpful to document one possible solution)\n", "Q: Email privacy on iPad : any trick to share the device without session feature? I wonder if some of you have found a way to share an iPad in a family and keep a reasonable privacy on the emails stored on the device (since there is nothing like a session management feature...)\nAny tricks or ways to handle this?\n\nA: The only trick is to actually go into settings app and delete the mail account by turning it off. Your password is still stored - just the data is flushed until you or the family goes to turn it on.\nIt prevents casual or accidental exposure of the mail contents in a similar manner to closing an unlocked door. It's a little better since your family will need to go poking to learn mail is off - especially if you leave enabled one account that has mail of a less private nature.\nFor meaningful security, you'll have to delete the account credentials and use webmail or enter it in only when you want access to the mail you consider private.\n\nAnother \"trick\" is to use a feature in gmail where it allows you to suppress certain mail folders from IMAP. This setting has worked for me on iOS to keep some archival folders from ever syncing to my devices (even though iOS uses exchange active sync to get the mail from gmail). You can see these messages through webmail or toggle the settings when you need to have them temporarily on your IMAP/exchange sync devices.\n\nA: If a jailbreak is a option for you you can search for iUsers: How to Have Multiple User Accounts on the iPad with iUsers Jailbreak Tweak\n", "Q: How can I share a link to a folder on a Time Capsule drive?

Now i have macbook pro with snow leopard OS and i am searching for equivalent of windows+l.\nSo my question is what is the keyboard shortcut to lock macbook pro? \ni know the shortcut COMMAND+SHIFT+Q.\nBut this shortcut is for logout not to lock the system.\n\nA: There isn't really a \"lock\" feature in Mac OS X. Your best option is to enable the \"Require password after sleep or screen saver begins\" option in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General. Then, either put the screen or entire computer to sleep. To put just the screen to sleep from the keyboard, type Shift+Control+Eject. This will make the screen go blank, but your computer will still be running. To put the entire computer to sleep, type Command+Option+Eject. This will cause all running processes to stop until the computer is woken up.\n\nA: control+shift+eject sets the display to sleep. If you have then the option \"Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins\" set in \"Security & Privacy\" it will lock your machine.\nThis will only put the display to sleep not the system: not exactly what you asked but the additional screen sleep is not bad (less energy consumption :-)\nThere are other answers here that point out ways to establish a automation to lock the screen from a keyboard command of your choosing.

I've tried toggling the setting and still get the flash animation.\n\nA: rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist\n\nThis will fix it every time.  Maybe someday apple will fix the bug that keeps corrupting com.apple.universalaccess.plist.\n\nA: Uncheck the 'visual bell' box in the preferences for your terminal style.\nTerminals->Preferences->Profiles->Advanced:\nBell:\nAudible bell\nVisual bell <>\n\nA: This sounds ridiculously simple, but it has worked for me in the past. Try checking and then unchecking Universal Access » Hearing » Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs -- this really sounds like that is the behavior in question, and sometimes setting it and the unsetting it resets to the desired behavior. (Note, this might be under Audio in newer versions of Mac OS.)\nThis basically checks that the preference file can be written to have a no then a yes and will clear up all sorts of minor issues in how apps can store preferences. The next step is to delete (or move to the desktop) the preference file for the affected application. In this case, the system stores this flash preference here:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist\nAt this point, you might need to expand to see if rebooting, trying a new user account helps isolate the issue.\n\nA: As discovered by corwin.amber in another post, the problem sometimes lies with a dead coreaudiod and can be fixed with:\nsudo killall coreaudiod\n\n\nA: Reposting here from another post as suggested by David Wolever. \nIn a similar situation, I was about to give up and reboot, but then I found that restarting the audio daemon resolves the issue:\nsudo killall coreaudiod\n\nThe symptom was: in the \"Sound Effects\" system setting panel, selecting alert sounds didn't do anything (usually it triggers a preview of the selected effect). My guess is that OS X fails to play an alert sound, and falls back to the visual cue.\n\nA: Aware this is an old thread, but today I realized this was happening since updating to Mac OS Catalina, so hopefully, this can help others.\nuser20095's comment above helped me to solve it.\nIn Sound > Sound Effects, the output device for alerts (HDMI monitor) was set differently to my main audio output (Headphone port). As this selected output was muted, no alert sounds were playing, therefore Mac OS defaulted to flashing the screen - even though the screen flash option was unchecked in Accessibility.\n\nA: Restart. This happens to me periodically. Restarting always fixes it.\n\nA: You can turn it off in System Preferences > Accessibility > Audio > Flash screen\n\nA: Could have to do with your audio alert set-up. This worked for me in OS X Mavericks. Under apple > preferences > assessability > audio:\nuncheck \"Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs\".\n\nA: Checking and then unchecking Universal Access » Hearing » Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs works pretty well.

Just wondering if I can, using Disk Utility, format the hard drive such that it is OS X Extended (HFS+) Journaled encrypted. Will Lion be able to install on that disk?\n\nA: I'd say this is more work than it's worth since Lion clearly isn't expecting to be able to deal with the new encryption scheme. You'd be better off running Lion virtually as that's far less work to do than hacking together the parts of Mountain Lion needed for file vault 2.\nThe obvious catch-22 is where you need to expose that disk to Lion to get it encrypted in the first place, the recovery HD placed on that drive will allow the installer to prompt for a password and get the CoreStorage keys set up to unlock that volume for the installer.\nAs mentioned in the comments, it's easiest to connect your encrypted Mac to another Mac in target disk mode to get the Lion installer to run (or better to just image things) - but advanced knowledge of fdesetup and the boot process also might allow other solutions. You will likely have continual problems with automatic rebooting since Lion isn't going to know how to decrypt the boot volume nor will the Recovery Boot image want to hand off to Lion since it's not supposed to know how to handle Filevault 2 drives in the first place.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/using-fdesetup-with-mountain-lions-filevault-2/\n\nA: I tried to install it and it is not possible or simply not straight forward to do.\nI tried it on a new MBA 2011 and a 2009 MacBook Pro.  The installer will let you install lion on the newly encrypted hard drive.  However it will not boot.  \nOn the MBA air you will get the below.  The Universal No Sign.\n\nIt was also very difficult to fix the install on the encrypted drive.   \nThe new MBA Air only has internet recovery,  somehow it cannot read the external hard drive or flash disk you installed OS X lion (from installesd.dmg).  This is a big pain.\nTo fix the encrypted HD issue you got again use Disk Utility to reformat it in to Os X extended Journaled .. only.   \nIf your lucky the install should go smooth.  However if you get an install error, saying you need to reinstall OS X.  \nYou need to reset the P-R ram.\nTurn off the computer,\nHold down “Command”, “Option”, “P” and “R” on the keyboard,\nTurn on the computer,\nKeep holding down the keys until the computer restarts itself again (maybe ten or fifteen seconds at most),\nRelease the keys after the computer has restarted again.\n\nAll in all. I don't recommend you try to format your boot able hard drive to be encrypted.  OS X has a security option that does that now.  Encrypts/Decrypts files on the fly.\nIf someone has successfully been able to format their hard-drive to be extended journaled encrypted and be able to boot and install lion.  Please let me know the instructions.\nOtherwise don't do it, it is a pain to try fix once you try to format your drive to be encrypted and try to install lion on it.\n\nA: I am guessing here:\nThe disk may have to be unlocked first.  It will either prompt you to unlock it during the installation, or you may have to do it by accessing Disk Utility before the install process (Utility menu on the 1st or 2nd screen of the install).\nAnother way of doing the same thing is not to have an encrypted disk, and install Lion.  After the installation completes, encrypt the disk through System Preferences -> Security.  It will prompt you to restart and then it will begin encrypting the whole disk, even as you use it.  Great feature.\n", "Q: Tips for using spotlight with webpages served via https I've started using spotlight with webpages today.

I have recently starting using Mail.app with two email accounts (work and home).

Are there any extensions or tips to make the currently selected \"from\" jump out at me in the compose window if it's not the 'default' from address?  In other words, 99% of the time, I use my main account, but if I accidentally open a compose window with the alternate account, I'd like a different background color in the compose window, or some big flashing icon or something.

To avoiding hassles sending from the wrong account with multiple mail accounts the only satisfactory way I have found, is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a real email account that does exist, for instance null@yourdomain.com, and set it up so that it works. \n\n*Once set up set after working so it appears in the available list of default mail accounts from which to send, set it as your default account. Then open Mail preferences, edit that account and chose 'None\" from SMTP server list for that account so you cannot send email from it, by mistake or otherwise. Save, and voila, you cannot send email from the wrong account.\nIt does mean you have to select the account you want to send to each time, but since the embarrassment of using the wrong account outweighs the hassle, for me, it is worth it. If you hit send without spotting it you just get the SMTP server list or the choice to edit your message, and so choose the right From account after clicking Edit Message.\nI wish Apple would have a blank field, or Null, for the default send account, that would solve this problem more elegantly.\n\nA: You can set up distinctive signatures, and link different ones to each account [in Mail/Preferences/Signatures]. \nAt one point I had an account that was being forwarded to me, but didn't have the capability to send outgoing emails.  Kept getting errors when I would inadvertently just try to reply from that account.  So I made a sig for it that was 36 pt bright red and said \"Wrong Account!\"  Usually, though, the differences are just strong enough to catch my attention without looking too \"loud\" to the recipient.  Perhaps just your work affiliation/title for the business one and a favourite quote or just a friendly signoff (\"Toodle-oo!\") for the personal one.  Since the sig is inserted at the end of the email automatically, it's easy to notice if it doesn't match your intent.\n\nA: There's a way to safely prevent sending new emails from a wrong account:\nIf you want to ALWAYS send emails from the same account, simply select that account in the \"Send new message from\" dropdown at Mail - Settings - Composing.\nIf you want to be forced to ALWAYS select the sender when composing an email, do the following:\n\n*\n\n*At Mail - Settings - Accounts add a new account which you call \"INVALID\". At \"Server Settings\" provide invalid credentials for the outgoing email server.\n\n*Then at Mail - Settings - Composing select \"INVALID\" in the \"Send new message from\" dropdown.\n\nWhenenver you compose a new email, you see \"INVALID\" (you can also call it \"PLEASE SELECT ME\") in the FROM line, incidcating to pick the correct account from the dropdown. Even if you forget to choose the correct account, Mac mail will remind you to do so by prompting that sending is not possible.\n", "Q: Launch terminal in new window by default Is it possible to set up Terminal to launch a new window by default? I recently came from running Ubuntu and I normally open hundreds of terminals a day. It's a pain to have to always right-click on the shortcut and select \"New Window\". If I could use Spotlight and have it open a new window instead of giving focus to the existing window, it would speed things up a lot.\n\nA: Not precisely the answer you asked for, but when Terminal is open, hitting Command-N will open a new window. Also, the first set of Terminal preferences (Settings tab, the \"On startup, open:\" buttons might be useful to play with.\n\nA: You can create a AppleScrip with this command:  \nopen -n /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app\n\nAnd add a global shortcut to call this script ;)\n\nA: If you want to have a means to quickly open a new Terminal window whether or not Terminal is already open, and whether or not it is the active application, you could use an AppleScript \"applet\" to do so. By placing the applet in the Dock, you can click on it to open a new Terminal window.\nThis script will create a new Terminal window:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    do script\nend tell\n\nTo create an applet containing this script from the command line:\nosacompile -o \"New Terminal Window.app\" -e 'tell application \"Terminal\"' -e 'activate' -e 'do script' -e 'end'\n\nTo reveal it in Finder so you can drag it to the Dock:\nopen -R \"New Terminal Window.app\"\n\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts for renaming file and accepting extension When I try to rename a file (by pressing enter, then changing the extension of the file), it pops up with an alert asking \"Are you sure you want to change the extensions ... \" and the old extension is selected in blue. I haven't found a keyboard shortcut for selecting the new extension from the popup alert. Is there a way? I need to rename dozens of files, and doing it all through the keyboard would be so much quicker than selecting this one alert with a mouse. \n\nA: You can disable the prompt under Finder's Preferences (see picture below):\n\nThis might save you some time if you are renaming multiple files. Additionally, you may want to look at Rename. It is a free utility that should serve you well for such simple batch renaming.\n\nA: After trial-and-error, figured it out. It's ⌘+U.\n\nA: There is no keyboard equivelant that I am aware of...\nYou could however use the terminal to make your life a little easier.

And it does not appear to be part of the initial improvements to Mail in iOS 5, according to news reports.\n", "Q: How to clean ._AppleDouble files from unix packages? Introduction\nHere's my problem. On occasion, I create the odd deb package using dpkg-deb (e.g., dpkg-deb --build \"folder\" file.deb). The problem is that any file with an extended attribute, carries along an ._AppleDouble file to the package. So when the user installs the bit of software, their system is littered with ._AppleDouble files.\nFor example, \n-rw-r--r--@  1 cksum  staff      18305  9 Sep 22:42 ScreenShot.png\n\nwould carry with it a ._ScreenShot.png file.\nCurrent Method of Coping\nCurrently, I'm using the incredibly agonizing xattr command to list the extended attribute and then strip them. For example, the above would be carrying the following as shown by xattr,\ncom.apple.FinderInfo\ncom.apple.metadata:kMDItemIsScreenCapture\ncom.apple.metadata:kMDItemScreenCaptureType\n\nIn this case, I would have to strip the resources one at a time, again using xattr,\nxattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo ScreenShot.png\nxattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemIsScreenCapture ScreenShot.png\nxattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemScreenCaptureType ScreenShot.png\n\nThis is quite arduous when you sometimes have dozens of files and has become far too much of a pain.\nI'm aware of the utility BlueHarvest, but I'm not keen on paying for something I won't use all that much. Additionally, I've trialed the software and have noticed that unfortunately, it sometimes fails to remove them all. Lastly, it is more suited for the management of disks used by different operating systems than it is for local folders.\nIdeal Solution\nAn ideal solution would be to continue using xattr (as it is the most reliable) but having the process automated. It is important that I remove the ._AppleDouble files before I package them. This, however, is not the only solution and I am certainly open to all manner of ideas. But I am hoping that I can accomplish my goal without the need to install additional programs or rely on daemons.\n\nA: There are many ways you can do this; Here are a couple that I've used:\ndot_clean /path/folder\n\nmerges dot-underscore files with their parent files.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/dot_clean.1.html\nIf you want to specifically target the .AppleDouble files you can use:\nfind / -name \".AppleDouble\" -depth -exec rm -Rf {} \\;\n\nwhich will simply find them and delete them.\nThere are ways you can also setup the process ahead of time for SMB shares, etc. when creating dpkgs. This may or may not apply to you, so I just wanted to mention it also.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4017\n\nA: I need to learn proper xattr usage.\nApparently, xattr has a \"clear\" (-c) command that can be applied using a wildcard (*), as follows,\nxattr -cr *\n\nThis results in a recursive removal of all ._AppleDouble files from the current folder on down (the -r flag does recursive, while the -c flag clears them), thus making the process a trivial one line command.\nThis does not however clear out the .DS_Store files. For that, you can employ the good old \"find\" command:\nfind . -type f -name .DS_Store -delete\n\nThis will find and delete any .DS_Store files from the current directory on down (recursively).\nLastly, we can bring it all together in the form of an alias that is called upon by simply typing \"xat\" (put the following in your .bash_profile):\nalias xat='find . -type f -name .DS_Store -delete && xattr -cr *'\n\nNow just run \"xat\" on any directory and it'll strip those pesky resource forks and remove those irritating .DS_Store files from anything inside of it.\n", "Q: Why is my Mac constantly trying to connect to another server? After logging on, I see this dialog box pop up. Whenever I dismiss it, it reappears 30 seconds later. (Stealing focus at the same time! Grrrr!)\n\n\"Slate\" is my old iMac, which is sitting on the desk next to me, turned off. How can I stop my new Mac from constantly trying to connect to my old one? Both are running 10.7.1.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure this was happening because when I logged out, I was running an app which was located on the other computer.\nI logged off and unchecked the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" box, which stopped Lion from trying to reopen the app the next time I logged in.\n\n\nA: This error typically comes up when OSX is trying to access a file or folder on a remote server, but it cannot connect to that server.\nI have two examples to give an idea of where this can come from:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are able to have OSX connect to a remote folder automatically at\nlogin. Typically these are shown in the \"Login Items\" tab of the\n\"Users & Groups\" pref pane\n\n\n*When an application attempts to open a file that's on a remote\nserver, OSX automatically tries to connect to that server in order\nto access the file.\nFor example: If the music in your iTunes library is on a mounted\nnetwork drive, and you have not connected the drive yet, playing a\ntrack will delay while it connects the drive and then iTunes will\nplay the track.\nIn both cases, if the server where these files are located cannot be found, that error will come up.\nFull disclosure: this was originally my answer to Endlessly repeating \"There was a problem connecting...\" error. That question has been marked as a duplicate of this one.\n\nA: I suspect you are connecting to a legacy file server as described in the kbase article below. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4700\nWe saw similar pop ups but clearing up our mounts addressed the issue. \n\nA: Check System Preferences>Accounts>Login Items to see if there is a disk that is supposed to mount when you login.

I don't have a YouTube password because Google merged YouTube accounts in your Google (Gmail) account.\nHow can I upload videos to YouTube?\n\nA: What I would do is go directly to the Youtube app (I am testing this with my old 3GS so this should work) and drag to the left to access all of the different menus, then click on the little up arrow next to my channel (assuming you are already logged in on the app) and then you just click on the video you want to upload instead of using the photos app and 'sharing' to Youtube. You could also try logging in to Youtube on a computer as on there it should give you the option to create a new Youtube account with your Gmail assuming that the cause of the problem is that your gmail is not tied to any Youtube. Assuming it let you create a new Youtube associated with your Gmail you should just be able to go back to the app on your iPhone and try again.\n", "Q: Power Macbook Air with Early 2008 Macbook Pro I have two batteries from my old 15\" Macbook Pro Core 2 Duo (Early 2008). It's a non-unibody (discrete) model. Anyone know of any way to use these batteries to power my 2nd Gen Macbook Air? An external battery costs ~$300-$450 and it seems kind of unnecessary if there is an adapter or some hack job way to make the old batteries work.\nNote: I'm not talking about replacing the macbook air batteries, I'm talking about using the macbook pro batteries as an external battery connected to the magsafe power port.\n\nA: Much like the commercial versions you mentioned, what you want to do is possible (that there are commercial versions essentially proved this). \nYou'll need to chop apart a MagSafe cable or figure out how to interact with Apple's airplane adapter. You'll also need to figure out how to interact with the batteries to get the correct voltage (and maybe do cell wear levelling). \nAlso, I doubt the MacBook Pro batteries will last anywhere near as long or be as reliable as the commercial versions. \n(There was an original answer, but it made incorrect assumptions that were addressed in the comments.

If I look at Preferences → Settings → Keyboard, the checkbox for Use option as meta key is at the bottom.\nI am on 10.7.1 so it may be something overlooked in the GM of Lion and fixed in the first patch.\n\nA: I came here an hour ago with the same question and now I feel the answer need to be better elaborated. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal. The terminal menu should appear near to the apple icon.\n\n*Click Terminal --> Preferences...

Vimeo, stuff on Apple.com, and more. The place where I consistently have a problem though, is YouTube. On a video such as this embed on Devour, about 10 seconds or so of content will play, and then playback will stop for 30-60 seconds as content buffers. Is there anything I can do to troubleshoot this, or better yet fix it?\nFor starters, I'm using my ISP's DNS server, as not doing so has led to problems with streaming from Apple and Netflix.\n\nA: With business class cable (10 to 30 Mb/s), even HD videos are basically instant on and play through completely. It's more a matter of selecting a smaller stream size by picking your web site or setting a preference if you can't getting a wider pipe to the internet.\nLatency isn't a big issue with streaming video - lots and lots of bandwidth is the major factor you can influence. Your mention of DNS is very important for things like Apple, Netflix, Google (YouTube) and others that set up content delivery networks to send you the files from a data center closest to your internet provider.\nStreaming takes little RAM and the CPU is barely involved in video as the GPU handles the vast majority of that specialized task.\nThe iPad is capable of huge bandwidth on 802.11n networks so it's not something you have to fix or tweak on the iPad end of things... \n", "Q: What is the wattage of the speakers in a 2011 MacBook Air?

I need a small graphical utility, using which I can ssh to a server and see all the files and copy and paste (drag and drop) into my local machine.\nI am running Snow Leopard.\n\nA: ExpanDrive\n\nExpanDrive acts just like a USB drive plugged into your computer. Open, edit, and save files to remote computers from within your favorite programs—even when they are on a server half a world away. ExpanDrive enhances every single application on your computer by transparently connecting it to remote data.\n\nA: Transmit\n\nPanic's Transmit tops my list. An extremely well built and executed FTP Client that fully supports sFTP. Priced at $34.\n\nTransmit is an excellent FTP (file transfer protocol), SFTP, S3\n  (Amazon.com file hosting) and iDisk/WebDAV client that allows you to\n  upload, download, and delete files over the internet. With the most\n  Mac-like interface available, Transmit makes FTP as simple, fun, and\n  easy as it can possibly be.\n\nForklift\n\nForklift 2 is another terrific client that is just as solid and just as well built. Priced at $29.95.\n\nForkLift will connect to any remote server FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3,\n  WebDAV, the SMB, NIS and AFP shares on your local network, or your\n  Bluetooth mobile phone- pretty much anything you can plug into or hook\n  up to a Mac. ForkLift also carries a complete toolbox for managing\n  your files, including Folder Synchronization, Batch Renaming, Archive\n  handling, Application deleter, editing files over remote connections\n  and many more. All these power features are packaged into a\n  Finder-like, dual-pane interface that delivers superior workflow while\n  remaining absolutely familiar to use, along with QuickLook, Spotlight\n  search and all.\n\nCyberduck\n\nLastly, Cyberduck rounds out the list. It is not as well polished, but it sturdy and does the job. It is free.\n\nCyberduck is a robust FTP/FTP-TLS/SFTP browser for the Mac whose lack\n  of visual clutter and cleverly intuitive features make it easy to use.\n  Support for external editors and system technologies such as\n  Spotlight, Bonjour, Keychain and AppleScript are built-in.\n\nThere are others to be sure, but these are the one's I've used and personally recommend. Additionally, you may want to hit up places like MacUpdate, VersionTracker, or iUseThis for these types of questions. You will find much more diversity and get a better understanding of the programs available to you.\n\nA: FileZilla\n\nI have tried Cyberduck and Flow in the past but Filezilla offers a side-by-side interface which is quite useful. The only limitation with this tool is that it's not really MacOSX-aware, e.g. it shows all hidden files \n\nA: Most other answers gave an objective analysis, but I'll share my experience.\nTop clients:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flow: really nice interface.\n\n*Transmit: very fast, can mount as Finder volume.\n\n*Cyberduck: the best for the inexistent buck.\n\n\nA: Cyberduck (Free)\nA great free FTP client. This is my go-to application. Anytime I need FTP access, I use Cyberduck. It's not quite as lightweight as Fugu, but it adds a lot more functionality than Fugu. I also really like the Growl integration with Cyberduck.\n\nFugu (Free)\nAwesome little FTP client. As I noted above, this is a lightweight FTP client. It is great for simple FTP transfers and browsing. I do like the dual panel navigation.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add these.\nFilezilla (Free)\nI haven't actually used Filezilla extensively, but from what I've seen of it, I really like it. I downloaded it and played with it for a bit and I really like the tabbed connections. I also like the ability to jump to a path easily.\n\nRBrowser (Free, $29 Upgrade)\nA free FTP/FTP-SSL client. I don't usually use RBrowser because a $29 upgrade is necessary to unlock other protocols (Local, FTP/SSL/TLS, SFTP-SSH). I do like the Site Manager. It's a handy little thing to have.\n\n\nI searched and came up with some other free FTP clients:\nFireFTP (Free) - Firefox extension\nThe one downside I see is that this is for Firefox. The website doesn't make it clear how it works with Firefox, so I assume it is an extension.\nMacfusion (Free)\nThis one relies on Google's MacFUSE. Since I don't know anything about MacFUSE, I don't know if this is good or bad.\nTransmit ($34) By Panic\nI have never used Transmit before, but I have used Coda and I definitely would recommend anything from Panic. The only reason I haven't used this because of the $34 price tag.\n\nForkLift2 ($30)\nNever used it, just found it when searching.\nFetch ($24 per user)\nAn amazing program with a long, long, long mac heritage. It's way up there with Transmit by Panic and Interarchy as a file transfer program loved by long time Mac power users.\nFlow ($30)\nNever used it, but looks good from the screenshots. I really like the fact that it looks like Finder. I may have to give this one a try.\n\nOneButton FTP (Free)\nJust searching around and found yet another one...It looks pretty nice, except it's no longer supported. However, you can still download it.\n\n\nA: Add to others\nUnfortunately RBrowser in not compatible with BigSur onwards\nRBrowser\nThis provides more of an interface like Finder than the others (stricyly much more like the original NeXT version) Apart form standard ssh/ftp it will syncronise directories etc.\n\n\nA: A more recent option is to use the newer implementation of Fuse for OSX in combination with SSHFS. This is a better solution because most of the applications mentioned are either outdated or payed (and expensive). \nFuse for OSX allows you to use new file systems in user space and SSHFS configures the system to allow you to connect to SSH drives automatically, as if they were drives supported by OSX. \n\nA: Yummy FTP (commercial) : http://www.yummysoftware.com/\nCan't believe the one that blows most of the above out of the water hasn't yet been mentioned.\n\nA: If you need graphical utility with support for SSH you may try CRAX. This software has a built-in SSH client and after connection to the SSH server it's possible to invoke file operations like copy, move, and delete.\n\n\nA: It's worth considering some of the Web-based alternatives, like Monsta FTP (Disclaimer: I'm involved with this).\nThey save you having to install software on every device; instead you do it all through your Web-browser, with the same features as any desktop client.\n\nA: If you are working with large files, then maybe consider Truck.app.\nIt employs rsync for file transfers, which is generally faster than FTP.\n\nDisclosure: I am the developer of Truck.\n\nA: I tried Cyberduck and Transmit. None of them has functionality of preserving modification date. SCP on terminal does that.\n\nA: If you have set up ssh public key authentication, you can use\nSSHFS-Mountlet \nwhich is a graphical front end to sshfs. It provides a menu bar icon under which you can mount or unmount your connection you have set up before. Sshfs has already been suggested by Fernando in a previous answer. Handling of the remote files happens using the macOS Finder.\nI was unhappy with the GUI clients for sshfs, so I wrote my own (GPL'ed).\n\nA: CaptainFTP is the best choice\nEasy to download from itunes:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/captain-ftp/id416544161?mt=12\n", "Q: Can you please explain how the terminal prompt works? I've got a question about the prompt in Mac's Terminal.\nI opened Terminal and was installing GIT. I don't know anything about Unix or how to use Terminal, so please forgive my ignorance. (I know that Terminal is very powerful, though. And it's easy to screw things up!)\nThe prompt reads as follows:\nMacintosh-2:~ myname$\n\nWhat does the Macintosh-2 mean? I've never seen this in front of a Terminal prompt.\nDo you think that my mac is okay? What happened to the standard prompt?\n\nA: It's your computer hostname. You can see and edit the value in \"System Preferences -> Sharing -> Computer Name\".\nThe prompt of the default shell (bash) can be changed by overriding the PS1 environment value.\n# will show >\nexport PS1='>'\n\n# will show the hostname followed by a space and >\nexport PS1='\\s >'\n\nThese values are entered in a file called .bash_profile located in the root of your home directory (e.g., /Users/yourname/ or ~/). The period before the file name effectively hides it. You can read more about unix hidden files here.\nYou can see the complete list of special characters (e.g., \\s) in the manual page of bash (your default shell).\nType man bash in the terminal and scroll down to the PROMPTING section.

As far as I understand there's no way to make Time Machine with SMB/CIFS; you have to connect using AFP.\nIs that true ? Is there a way to make it work ?\nI'm using OS X Lion.\n\nA: You'll need to create a HFS+ .sparsebundle disk image and use the tmutil command line utility to tell Time Machine to use that drive as the backup destination. In turn, you can put that drive just about anywhere. Note that you need to give a permanent home (i.e. don't move it elsewhere) to the disk image first before targeting it with tmutil as a backup destination.\nI've recently wrote a blog post how to use a network drive as a Time Machine destination. You can also use the same technique to use drives with other filesystems (like NTFS for example) as a Time Machine destination drive, as long as Lion can write to it (for NTFS, you'll need either NTFS-3G, Tuxera, or Paragon's drivers to write to them).\n\nA: For reference, Time Machine now officially supports SMB shares, tho they need special protocol extensions (supported e.g. by Samba >= 4.8).

Having several related files in different folders, I was looking for a way to combine them in the same view,  like the \"Libraries\" of Windows Explorer in Win7.\nWhile Finder has great smart folder capabilities, I don't see any way to do this? Third-party tools are welcome.\n\nA: Easiest way I can think of to do it is if you bring up the file info window by pressing ⌘ + i keys, and then add something into the Spotlight Comments field that you keep the same through the files you want. Rinse and repeat for the files. Create a new Smart Folder, for the search option go to Other... and it'll bring up the full list, which will include Spotlight Comments.\n\nA: At the risk of stating an idea too obvious to merit an answer, I will point out that ever since OS X 10.9 Mavericks, tags are perhaps the most obvious way to take \"several related files in different folders\" and \"combine them in the same view\" as stated in the original question.\nIn the Finder, select any item and then use the Tags... menu item (to which you can assign a keyboard shortcut in the Keyboard system preferences pane), or the Edit Tags button in the toolbar of any Finder window, to assign a tag to that item. You can then click on the name of that tag in the recent tags list (in the sidebar of any Finder window) to see a list of all files tagged with that tag. Or you can search for that tag and save the search as a smart folder. You can tag any items that appear in Spotlight search results, including email, contacts, reminders, etc. For more information about working with tags, see my answer to this question about tags best practices.\n\nA: I found a hint about it, the idea is to make a saved search that scopes the first folder you want, edit the XXX.savedSearch in a text editor and add other folders to the scope, so that it looks like this \n<key>FXScopeArrayOfPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Volumes/DD/Documents</string>\n        <string>/Users/charles2/Documents</string>\n    </array>\n\nIt's not exactly like library because you get all the files, though.\n\nA: For documents there is an app in the Mac App Store iDocuments Lite. It seems similar to iPhoto and/or iTunes but for documents. \n\n\n*\n\n*Auto Import & Management \n\n*Organize and manage documents on your Mac using collections, folders and smart folders.\n\n*Quick tag, Open Metadata supported.\n\n*Search the documents by small clue like keywords, title, and author's name etc.\n\n*Auto Run, Batch process (full version) \n\n*Click to share (full version)\n\n\nThere are some other features available not listed above. The app puts everyone of your documents in an easy to access library. Haven't been able to find a single app that encompasses all file types rather a separate app for music, photo's, documents etc. The Lite version in the App Store is free, might be worth checking into. The Full version is $49.95.\n\nA: There is no particularly complete way of replicating the libraries feature on Windows.  The many options already offered make a great way to combine the existing files, but all fall down when it comes to adding new ones.\nThe problem is knowing where the default location for new files goes.  In the Windows 7 system it's not just a collection of (say) 3  users picture libraries shown individually in a picture library, it's the contents of those libraries all lumped together without any distinction as to where the originally came from.  A new file added into it would go into the users default library directory.\nIn our Smart Folder attempts to recreate this the folder would necessarily be read only, as it's not a genuine location, and the only way we can add files into the folder would be to go to the source and add them direct.  Creating a collection of sym links, or using the Burn folder (Great tip for creating sym link folder collections by the way) has the benefits of allowing you to write into the folder direct, but you will still have a top level where each individual source is shown separately rather than an amalgamation of contents that you can also write into.\nSo, the short answer is a No, sadly, there no way to recreate this in the same way.\n\nA: I found a couple of ways that might work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a Burn Folder (Finder > File > New Burn Folder) and drag those items you want to include into it. They will be aliases, but as far as I can tell (from a little research, without having used Windows 7) aliases are what Windows 7 is using for the contents of its Libraries. You can rename the Burn Folder and put it where you please and, of course, you could even burn it to a CD (but you don't have to).\n\n*Make an ordinary folder (Finder > File > New Folder) and fill it with aliases of those items you wish to place in it. This would be the roll-your-own method, I guess.\n\nA: First, a disclaimer that I haven't worked with the Windows Library function, so if I've missed some major benefit or function, I apologize. As others have stated, Mac OS X doesn't currently directly support (what I would call) collections of files–groups of files related by user-defined criteria–directly. (Technically of course, a \"folder\" fits into this definition, but, ignoring aliases for the moment, a file can only live in one folder collection.)\nA few years back Lifehacker posted Metadata as a 'filing system'. The idea is, in essence, to tag all of your files and use Spotlight and Smart Folders to find and \"organize\" those files.\nOn a smaller scale, I keep many of my text files in Yojimbo and use it to create collections. My writing workflow is now plaintext/markdown based, so Yojimbo is an archive of my writing. Once I drank the kool-aid, Yojimbo reduced my Documents folder, and it's hierarchy, significantly.\nYojimbo doesn't work for all file types though. EagleFiler  brings many of Yojimbo's features to the Finder and can be applied to different file types. The caveat being that of these programs build a database of your files and you have to manage the files from within the software UI.\nEnter Yep which uses OpenMeta tags, allowing you to move, copy and delete files freely using the Finder.  Yep seemingly provides much of the functionality, flexibility and convenience of the Microsoft Library with the least imposition on workflow. \n\nOpenMeta is an OS X Cocoa Objective - C technology that allows any\n  application to read and or write tags, ratings, etc to any file. It\n  works with 10.5 and 10.6\nThe idea of the project is for commercial, open source and in house\n  programs to be able to use OpenMeta for reading, writing and dealing\n  with user defined meta data. The metadata is stored in extended\n  attributes (xattr).\nSome of the metadata stored can be stored in such a way so as to\n  trigger the Spotlight indexer to add the data to the Spotlight DB,\n  allowing it to be searchable.\n\n", "Q: Downloading and uploading files through Safari iOS I am aware that iPad does not have a file-system in traditional sense.\nI want to know how Safari for iOS behaves when trying to download/upload files from/to a website.\nSuppose I go to sourceforge.net and click on a link to download zip file? Would Safari download it? If yes, where does it get stored and how do I access it (without using iTunes to first move it to a PC).\nDoes Safari on iOS allow the downloading of only some files and reject others, or does it allow downloading all of them or rejects all of them?\nLastly, if a webpage has a file upload control (input type=\"file\"), how does Safari behave (would it allow upload, allow upload on only some sites or the download control does not work at all)?\n\nA: Actually the iOS does have a filesystem, and each app gets access to a sandboxed portion of the file system. \nThe iOS \"system\" itself has several programs that do access the filesystem directly, but mobile safari acts more like a restricted app purchased from iTunes than say springboard or the app store app itself. \nUploads are basically impossible in iOS. Mobile Safari doesn't read from the address book (which most sandboxed apps can and will do by default). It also doesn't use the photo picker to upload pictures or video. \nDownloads are possible, but often require a helper app to store and use the download. Safari handles mp3, streams, and other media itself and lets you listen or watch the \"download\". You can't save it in the way a computer allows, but the web server thinks a download happened and safari actually downloads the file to it's cache (where it stays until the cache fills and it ages out and gets deleted). All other file types are handled as the iOS uses UTI file detectors to see which apps installed can handle a potential download. (The developer document I linked to has several paragraphs readable by anyone, but it dives into developer minutia very quickly so feel free to bail on that link before the simple idea behind UTI gets confused)\nIf safari detects another app has registered for a download, you will see an \"open in apptastic\" to indicate that mobile safari will download that file but hand it off to another app to store in that app's sandbox. \nSafari uses a system API call to have the iOS do the writing across sandboxes. \n\nSince you asked about a zip file, all you need on your iPad is to find an app that tells iOS it can handle zip files, and as long as the sourceforge servers send enough data for mobile safari to detect a zip file, you can download it over to your app. The reverse trip is harder, your ZIP app can't really push a file to safari for upload. Your app has to be programmed to log into sourceforge directly and call the upload API itself. (which technically will probably use the mobile safari code / webkit to do a http upload - but that all happens behind the scenes, not in what we see and control as mobile safari with the blue compass icon)\n\nA: Mobile Safari itself cannot store files for you (without jailbreaking). However some Apps like Dropbox register with Safari and enable limited support for some filetypes.\nFile inputs are just disabled/greyed out on Mobile Safari.\n", "Q: Can't shift+select in Finder in Lion 10.7.1 In previous versions of Mac OS X, to select a whole row of files, you select the file which comes first in the row and then select the last file with a shift+click.\nWhen I try this procedure in icon view in Lion, it behaves as if I would select the files separately.\nWhat changed? Is there a way to restore the old behavior?\n\nA: Problem solved: Seems to be a feature when you try to shift+select files in icon view\n", "Q: Transfering iPhone4 pics to iPad2? there\nI know there's many ways to transfer multiple pictures from an iPhone to an iPad,but i want to transfer them using only the iPhone and iPad, without a PC or Mac. I was wondering if there was an app that would allow me to do this on the go.\nHope you nice guys can help me,ths!\n\nA: It is called iCloud and is released next Month.\n\nA: The Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit allows you to transfer pictures from a camera (including an iPhone) to an iPad via USB.  \n\nA: you can use Dropbox to share files between your devices  \n\nA: This article suggests that LY MobileSoft  has developed an app that allows pictures to be shared between iOS devices.\n\nA: Upload all of the pictures from the iPhone to a photo sharing service (ie. Flickr, Photobucket, Google, et al.), and then download them using the same app on the iPad.

It lets you search for tweets (or other social media) and stream it into a list of points to make up your story.\nI first noticed Jason Kottke using it a couple of days ago to make a story out of the tweets from Gavin Purcell about production of that night's Jimmy Fallon show.

It contains an HFS volume B. I am running on Snow Leopard.\nThe DMG now pretty much fills A, and I'm fine with that. This is not about space on A.\nWhen I delete files from B, the free space Finder shows for B does not change, and it refuses to copy new files onto B. Emptying the trash doesn't help. Ejecting doesn't help. But verifying (not repairing) B in Disk Utility does, even though no errors are found.\nThis is a bit of a chore. How do I get better behaviour?\n\nA: Both sparse disk images and the newer sparse bundle disk images intentionality do not reap/reclaim space until they need to. This is especially so for a sparse bundle - which is designed to reduce the network transfers when the image is stored on a network share. It certainly speeds up normal read/write operations since the system can assume compact won't happen when the files are changing. When you check things in disk utility, it perhaps sees that space could be reclaimed and does that for you. You are correct, that in normal use, it ends up with you using more space than if you simply put things on the normal file system.\nYou could convert your storage to a normal sparse image to get more traditional freeing of space when you delete files stored within the disk image.\nCertainly read the first two paragraphs of the man page for hdiutil.\nYou can of course kick off a manual compact operation with:\n\n\n*\n\n*hdiutil compact /path/to/sparsebundle.dmg\n\nA: A disk image is like a \"virtual\" drive i.e. a hard disk in a hard disk even if you delete a file the hard disk capacity remains constant, only the amount of available space changes, that is why your disk image remains the same size even after you delete files\n", "Q: Administratively, how can you purchase multiple licenses from the Mac App Store? I need to purchase 10 licenses for an app found on the Mac App Store (not iTunes). How do I go about purchasing those 10 distinct licenses and then deploy them to their respective machines?\n\nA: Administratively, it might be easiest to use the gift feature to purchase all the 10 apps at once and file your expense reports. You are then free to use that account to redeem one copy - or pass off one (or more) of the redemption codes to whatever deploy accounts you use.\nCurrently, the iOS app store has more volume purchase options:\n\n\n*\n\n*App Store Volume Purchase Program for Education\n\n*App Store Volume Purchase Program for Business\nI would join one of these if you can and inquire if/when it would extend to the Mac App Store for OS X. (Nothing speaks louder than action).\nIn the mean time, you can use gifting to separate the payment from the redemption and hand out the redemption codes as needed to the actual accounts you use to deploy the apps. I haven't had any issues with one account on 15 macs to ease the administrative burden. Do make sure to buy enough copies before adding new macs to keep things within the terms of the license. My reading (and I'm not a lawyer) is a person can install their apps on macs they control and own with no limit (not 5 or 10) and businesses/organizations are to buy one license per machine. I don't see a technical or moral reason to actually redeem each copy (especially if you secure / never further distribute those redemption codes). \nI personally can't wait until a unified volume plan arrives for the Mac App store - discount or not, having it centrally managed and downloading a spreadsheet to track things is so useful as we're more constrained with time and expertise than the cost of the software at present.\n", "Q: Automatically change settings of Terminal when in full screen I often use emacs from a terminal (emacs -nw), and when comparing two files side-by-side (C-x 3) it is often useful to go into full-screen mode.  I'm using a 27\" screen, so full-screen mode provides a lot of screen real estate, usually more than I need.  To counteract this, I typically increase the font size under Terminal->Preferences->Setings.\nIs there a way to have settings -- e.g. font size -- changed automatically when going to full screen in a Terminal application?\nI notice that one can define a preset Setting, which can be swapped out easily, but it would be nice if it was swapped out automatically when going full screen.\n\nA: You could try AppleScript to do something like\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set zoomed of window 0 to true\n    set font size of window 0 to 24\nend tell\n\nbut I haven't found a way to activate fullscreen mode this way yet\n", "Q: How do I restore a case-sensitive, journaled Time Machine backup to a case-insensitive, journaled filesystem? I would effectively like to switch from a case-sensitive journaled filesystem to that of a case-insensitive journaled filesystem. Booting into Lion's recovery allows me to format the drive as I wish, however, no matter what I choose Time Machine will always reformat it as a case-sensitive journaled filesystem (which makes sense). My question is, how can I make this switch?\n\nA: The correct answer (after several days of experimentation) was to remove all ambiguously named files that would have a conflict. Then using another admin user, restore the original user using migration assistant. If you don't remove ambiguously named files, migration assistant will move what it can and then fail at some point giving no indication that it actually failed. You'll be without data and you won't know what. \n\nA: You can restore from TimeMachine manually by opening Terminal.app and using cp to copy the latest backup back to your main drive. Taking care of all the permission and metadata issues isn't for the faint of heart though (which makes it a bit difficult to provide a specific answer as well).\n", "Q: How do I stop .dmgs from automatically mounting? I'm trying to find the best means of stopping dmg files mounting in OS X 10.6.  I was shown a system where 'no mountable filesystem,' would pop up whenever a user tried to mount a dmg but I can't recall how it was achieved.  I'm currently using parental controls but it keeps getting circumvented.  Any help appreciated.\n\nA: As Administrator user, remove read access from /System/Library/CoreServices/DiskImageMounter.app (and /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app to be on the safe side) for \"Everyone\" (in the Get Info dialog in the Finder). \n\nA: 1) Rather than remove read access Disk Utility.app, use Parental Controls to prevent it from being accessed.

Whenever I right-click on a file and go to the Open With> menu, it always takes forever to  load. I know I'm not the only one with this problem (at least I think so), so I was wondering if anyone has figured out how to speed it up. Is there a way to speed it up or to remove certain application from the menu?\n\nA: There is a free utility called Open-With Manager that helps you clean out the unnecessary apps associated with certain file types:\n\nOpen-With Manager lets you edit the list of file types a given application thinks it can open. This is most useful with regard to the Finder's \"Open with\" context menu; and it also affects the way applications behave when you drag files to their Dock symbols.\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, Open-With Manager works in a way that's quite similar to Service Scrubber. And to be perfectly honest, Open-With Manager is in fact Service Scrubber's well-hidden, slightly older twin brother. That's why the restrictions detailed for Service Scrubber in this blog entry apply to Open-With Manager as well. When running on Mac OS X 10.5 or later, Open-With Manager will not edit signed applications.\n\nI use this on Snow Leopard, but I haven’t tested it on Lion. Also, it may take a while for the Open-With menus to reflect the changes made in Open-With Manager, so try waiting or just reboot.\n\nA: I second the comment about the file type affecting it. The more applications you have capable of opening a type of file, the longer the menu will take.\nHowever, if you don't have some ridiculous number of items showing in the list, there is another possible cause of this type of slowdown.\nDo you have an external drive with applications installed that remains connected to your Mac? I use Carbon Copy Cloner to periodically clone my OS drive to an external which always remains connected to my Mac.\nBecause of this, there are two copies of any given application in my /Applications folder; one on the main drive and one on the backup drive.\nI noticed that every time I went to the Open With menu, the external drive would spin up, and there would be two copies of all my applications in the menu.\nThis means that in order to populate that menu, the OS searches all drives, not just the system drive, for applications. \nA lot of USB drives spin themselves down regardless of what settings you have in Energy Saver. This is what my drive does. Each time I open that menu, if the drive is spun down, the OS waits for it to spin up before showing the menu.\nSetting it up so that my drive is only mounted while a backup is taking place, made a huge difference in the performance of that menu and Finder in general, especially \"Save As\" dialog boxes.\nJust something else to consider.\n", "Q: Reverse Resume Functionality for Safari I would like to reverse the resume keys for Safari. i.e.; Command-Q should quit and not save any tabs (since that is what I normally want to do).

Thanks,\nPito\n\nA: In my mind there are a couple of likely issues.  If the machine is crashing with a kernel panic I would suspect the hard drive is on it's way out.  If the machine is simply restarting without warning then I would suspect the memory.  \nTo see if it is the memory it might be as simple as removing each stick of ram and blowing any dust off with compressed air and putting it back in.  If this doesn't resolve it, I would get a new drive and clone the system using a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper!  Boot from the new drive and see if the issues go away.  \nIf neither work then you could try reinstalling OS X, I doubt that's the issue.  You more than likely have a failing video card or logic board if the above suggestions don't work. \n\nA: The entries in logs means that your OSX is out of physical memory and it started to use swap space.

You have to select the text, right-click, go under font and pick the color from there (at least on my Lion machine)\n\n*Set that signature as your default\n\n*When you compose a new message, put your cursor on the beginning of the line that the signature is on, hit enter a few times, and when you start typing your message it will be in that font/color. There will be a blank line at the top that is formatted black, which you can backspace to delete, just make sure you've started typing something first or it will set it back to black.\n\n\nA: Some people have created apps to try and make up for this feature (setting default font, size, color) being missing in Mail:\nMessageFont\nUniversal Mailer\nI have not tried them myself.\nCommonly used alternative email clients which do have the feature are Thunderbird and Entourage/Outlook.\n", "Q: Using php5-rar to extract files with an RAR extension Recently, I received a compressed file with an RAR extension from a colleague. Not being able to view it under MacOS, I went on to download the MacPort php5-rar thinking that it would solve my problem.  I soon realized that this was not a utility, but an API for viewing, extracting and creating RAR files programmatically.  Please correct me if I am wrong, since the only documentation I have been able to find on this MacPort thus far is an API reference manual.\nBy later browsing this SE, I discovered that there is another utility called iUnarchive, which allows one to extract/view RAR files.  As I am a bit ignorant when it comes to these things, if I were to download and install it, would it interfere with the php5-rar MacPort that I installed earlier?\nFurthermore, as iUnarchive appears to be a tool only for extracting/viewing files, is there an equivalent (free) tool under MacOS that can be used to create RAR files?\n\nA: There does not appear to be any freeware RAR compression software according to this Wikipedia article. However, if you are willing to consider trialware (or \"nagware\"), you can download the commandline RAR for OS X (also see here).\n\nA: Perl is the only scripting language I know of that occasionally ships user-invocable binaries that are built with the module it came with. You can always roll your own software of some sort that leverages the library, but since it's obvious that you want to take much less time;\nI've been a fan of UnRarX for some time, dating at least back to my use of Leopard. I don't see RAR files very often anymore, but when I do, I've only ever used UnRarX, or StuffIt Expander, the difference being that UnRarX gets in your way a lot less than StuffIt seemed to at the time.\nNote, however, that UnRarX does not do package creation.\nNote that the Mac App Store has plenty of apps that match a simple search for 'rar', the only free ones are The Unarchiver, StuffIt Expander, Tiny Expander, ALZip, and iPackr. (All the proceeding links are Mac App Store links.)\nInstalling any of the above apps should have no effect whatsoever on the php5-rar package.\n", "Q: Where are the default (system) wallpaper folders located on OS X? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhere are Apple's default desktop images stored? \n\nDoes anybody know where the folders containing the default (i.e. system) wallpapers are located on OS X Lion? (it may not have changed from previous versions of OS X, so please also tell me if you know where they are on a previous version of OS X). Thanks!\n[EDIT:] Indeed, a dupe. What threw me off was that I was looking for \"Wallpaper\", not \"Desktop Pictures\". Maybe add a tag synonym [wallpaper] for [desktop], to aid searching people who make the same mistake. \n\nA: Its on:\n/Library/Desktop Pictures/\nNotice though this is the system library, not the user library, so its right on the root of the drive and not inside your user folder.\nIts hidden by default.

At first, my iPod was recognized by the computer as a digital camera but this has already been fixed.\n\nA: First, try connecting to a different computer and/or using a different cable to rule out the possibility of it being something other than the iPod.\nNext, check if there are any defects with the iPod. If you are using iOS 5, configure it to back up all your data to iCloud.\nFinally, you may want to consider putting the iPod into recovery mode and trying to restore from there. If that does not work, you may want to visit the Genius Bar to check for any hardware issues. \nHow to do it: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1808\nNote: if you are out of warranty, and suspect it may be a physical issue, you may just want to continue using the iPod as it is, because once you put it into recovery mode you may not be able to get out of it \n\nA: Try a different cable or connecting the iPod to another USB port on your computer.\n\nA: Is your iPod functioning 100%? Any problems outside of iTunes?\nOne thing I have noticed is that iTunes doesn't like that Windows users have multiple USB devices connected at the same time. So you might want to try removing all but the iPod and try restoring from iTunes from that.\n\nA: Try unplugging your device and rebooting it (press and hold power till you see slide to power off, slide it, then turn back on). Once you're at the homescreen, close iTunes and try connecting again. \nIf that doesn't work, unplug every device connected to your PC that isn't required to control it (i.e. don't unplug the power, mouse, keyboard or monitor). Close all programs that are open, including iTunes. Now try plugging in your device, opening iTunes if it doesn't do so automatically. Try this after a reboot if this doesn't work. \nIf that still doesn't work, confirm the USB cable isn't broken. The cord inside that transfers data might have a cut somewhere; if this is the case, the easiest way to fix it is just to buy a new cable from Apple. \n", "Q: Apple TV2 Remote not working My Apple TV2 stopped responding to the IR remote all of a sudden. The white LED would blink with every button press, but nothing would happen. I was able to pair the Apple TV's remote with my Macbook Pro, and it worked fine. My old plastic IR remote, which still works with my MBP also displayed the same behavior with the Apple TV. \nThe Apple TV did respond to the iOS remote app, so that's not the problem either.\n\nA: I only asked this question because it was bothering me all day and couldn't find an acceptable answer, so here it is:\nHold the Left/Back button and the Menu button (on the aluminum remote) for 6+ seconds.\nThat's it!\n\nA: Same thing happened to me. In my case, the solution was to use a iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch) and download the free Remote App.\nWith that App you gain control again to the AppleTV, move to the configuration menu and pair again the remote with the box. It takes a minute and everithing was back to normal.\n", "Q: FileVault 2 encrypted disks with my home directory on a different drive I have multiple volumes on my mac and I just enabled encryption on the other drives. My home folder is stored on one of those drives. Now I can't login because it can't see my home directory, but if I login with my admin account it unlocks the drives and then I can login.\nHow do I add those passwords to my login keychain, so they can find my home directory?\nI could decrypt my home directory, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having it encrypted. And my home directory is too big to fit on my boot disk.\n\nA: When logged in as your admin user, you can use Keychain Access.app and just move (or copy) the keychain item containing the password for the encrypted volume to the System keychain.  This makes the password available at boot time. I've got a similar setup, and it worked like this for me.\n\nA: Make sure you've added your non-admin account to the list of users permitted to unlock the drive. This is accomplished in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Filevault.\nhttp://one.utsa.edu/sites/oit/OITConnect/mac/MacKB/Pages/Adding%20Login%20Users%20to%20FileVault.aspx\n", "Q: Do Macs care which USB socket you plug devices into? Windows never likes when you stick things into different (USB) holes. It has to recognise the thing again, install drivers, again, etc.\nIs that the case with Mac? Eg. I keep Time Machine on a USB drive. Does my MacBook Pro care which port I stick it into?\n\nA: Not really, or at least not to the same level that Windows does.\n\nA: It's up to the driver; here are some rules for devices supported by default.\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't matter for disks.\n\n*It doesn't matter for HID devices (mouse/keyboard).\n\n*It does matter for audio interfaces. You won't have to “reinstall”, but it will be considered a different device so you'll have to choose it again from the list of audio devices.\n\n\nA: There is something else to keep in mind with the Apple laptops.\nFor some reason there is slightly more power that comes out of the USB port that is closer to the power adapter on your machine. \nYou can tell the difference because trying to charge an iPad in the wrong USB port will cause it to take MUCH longer. \nhttp://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/05/the-macbook-all/\nHowever, as far as the software goes - there mac is very forgiving if you plug a printer (for example) in to one USB port one day, and another USB port another day.

I woke up this morning to my MBP whizzing along (i.e. the fan that is).  Looking at Activity Monitor, I saw gpg-agent taking up 97% of cpu, and launchd taking 60%, plus maybe one or two that were also high (one of them was font related -- fontd? I forget).\nI am using Mozy, and it was doing a backup over night, but it has been for the last few weeks.  \nAfter killing all my apps, these runaway processes remained, so I restarted, and the issue resolved itself. \nAfter restarting, and googling a bit, I checked console, and see hundreds of messages for just gpg-agent, and this is just over the course of a few seconds.  I'm guessing this may have been going on for longer since these were the first entries in the log and started at 6am.\n9/23/11 6:07:24.504 AM org.gpgtools.macgpg2.gpg-agent: gpg-agent[110]: accept failed: Too many open files\n\nMozy was my top suspect, but I don't even know if Mozy uses any of those cpu-spending apps I mentioned.  Other apps that were running: TimeMachine, Dropbox, Skype, Adium, Chrome, Eclipse, Evernote.  Perhaps something with Lion?  or KeyVault2 (my disk does have encryption on)? \nOther computer weirdness that may or may not be related:\nI've had my computer restart on me twice this month overnight (i.e. I go to use the computer in the morning, and it's at the login screen).  Sleep should be activating (it is at default MBP settings w/ computer sleep at 12 minutes or so).  This may be coinciding with Mozy install, but can't say for sure (Mozy was installed last week, and my first overnight crash might have been before, but I don't recall for sure).\nAnother issue I've had a few times since installing Lion is I'll go to use the computer after it being in my bag for a few hours, and all the applications are there, but won't respond to my keyboard nor closing.  I can interact with the windows (i.e. Cmd-Tab, dragging), but not much else.  Sometimes/always the Restart option in the Apple menu doesn't respond, but pushing the power button once does bring up the menu to sleep/restart/shutdown, and I can restart from here. (This issue I reported to Apple as potential Lion bug)\nI just remembered, I installed the recommended updates yesterday afternoon (bios update for Lion and Thunderbolt, some security update, and other update for Thunderbolt).  It had me restart, then after it seemed to install, brought me to a screen which said, \"Hold down the power button until your computer turns off, then turn back on\".  I assume this was part of the bios update.  I think when the computer came back on, it did some installing. Then when OS boots up, OS tells me \"it had to restart for unknown reason\" and had me send a report to Apple.  I sent that along, and continued working on the computer since then (no other restarts).  This doesn't seem like it would be related, but figured mention it just in case.\nAbout my system\nMBP early 2011 15\" base model, Lion built from scratch, KeyVault2 hard drive encryption turned on; SSD and Crucial memory were upgraded after purchase; TRIM turned on via some 3rd party instructions a month or two ago (I can find the how-to article if it seems relevant).\n\nA: My problems covered a few areas, but all stability seems to have been addressed.  \nRegarding the gpg-agent issue, I haven't seen that come up again, and this maybe attributed to one of two things: 1) uninstalling Mozy; 2) keeping up with the OS X system updates.  I don't know which of these for sure, or if the issue is actually fixed, but several months later, I haven't seen this issue reoccur (Mozy was probably uninstalled a week or two after originally posting this).\nRegarding the sleeping/freezing oddness, this may have been addressed by OS X system updates as well, or could have been related to this sleep issue I had with locking screen vs. going to sleep, detailed here: How do I stop my MacBook Pro from randomly freezing when trying to go to sleep?\nAs of this follow-up, I'm running 10.7.4.  Hopefully this helps someone else pinpoint a similar issue. \n", "Q: Need to create a common workspace between two macs connected wirelessly in a network I need to create a common development workspace between two macs connected in a wi-fi network. Sort of like a shared folder. But the problem using a shared folder is that there are a lot of ownership issues and stuff. The ownership can be for both or an individual mac. Any ideas ?\n\nA: It might be worth your time to learn how to handle the \"ownership issues and stuff\".\nI do not have a definitive answer, but it is possible to attach an external hard drive to a Mac and to instruct the OS of that Mac to ignore all file permissions/privileges on that external hard drive. If those files and folders on that external hard drive are then shared over the network, (I do not know for certain) it may be possible that another user on another Mac across the network might also access those files without regard to the permissions assigned to them by default.\nTry this:\nIn the Finder, mount the external drive and choose File: Get Info. In the Info window, at the bottom, click on the Lock button, authenticate, and check the box next to \"Ignore ownership on this volume\".\n\nWhile we are examining this, here is how to give your coworker full privileges to access a shared folder or volume that is on your Mac or attached to it.\nUnder System Preferences: Sharing, enable File Sharing and add that specific volume to the Shared Folders list using the plus button under Shared Folders: For good measure, manually add your co-worker's name and password under Users: and give them Read & Write privileges.\n\n\n\nFinally, there is a freeware graphical utility that you can use to change all file permissions on a file or folder without needing to use the command line or the Finder's Get Info windows. It is called BatChmod. However, using it can have unintended consequences if you do not have a good understanding of how Mac permissions work. Use this utility carefully and avoid using it on the contents of entire folders if you are uncertain as to what you are doing.\n\n\nA: How close are the computers? depending on the environment it might also be useful to see if synergy can help improve your works station. \nhttp://synergy-foss.org/\nAlso Dropbox is good or cloudApp for quick uploads and syncs of data. If your computers are on the same wifi you can just setup Shared folders and access limited by accounts. At work I have two iMacs that share files via all these options. System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing . Then just add the folders you want to share and set the users that will have access and what these users can do with the folders.\n\nA: This is kind of taking the long way around, but if the data is not sensitive you could use a Dropbox shared folder.\n\nA: This is exactly the scenario that version control systems, like GIT, are designed to handle. Even after you overcome the file permission/ownership issues, you still have the problem of managing changes.\nDirect from the GIT Reference Manual:\n\nMany people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into\n  another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re\n  clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it\n  is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory\n  you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files\n  you don’t mean to.\n\nSound familiar?\nYour best bet is spend a small amount of time to download and learn GIT which will not only solve the current problem of \"checking in/out files\" but probably a number of issues you are running into and don't know yet.\nThey even have a 15 minute online primer - Learn GIT in your browser - so you can be up and running pretty quickly.\n", "Q: Files created by Windows on Lion SMB shares have 600 permissions I have File Sharing enabled in OS X Lion, and I'm accessing the shares using Win XP and Win 7 boxes. I can read and write fine, by when I create a new file, the permissions for that file defaults to 600, and is accessible only by the account authenticated with SMB. If I edit files, permissions are not changed. It is only new files that have this problem. This means other accounts on OS X cannot access the files, and neither can the apache server, which runs as _www I think.\nIs there a way to make Lion SMB mark new files as 644 instead?\n\nA: I think this could be a bug. I'm seeing the same behaviour in Mountain Lion too.\nI've ensured that the file sharing settings are correct. Go to the folder in Finder and verify that the user has correct permissions, including creating files locally, which result in the correct (644) permissions. Go to System Preferences -> Sharing and select the share, and verify the user is in the list with read&write permissions.\nUsing the command line tool:\n$ dscl localhost -list /Local/Default/SharePoints\n\nto list shares, and:\n$ dscl localhost -read /Local/Default/SharePoints/<sharename>\n\nI can see:\ndsAttrTypeNative:smb_createmask: 644\ndsAttrTypeNative:smb_directorymask: 755\n\nYet files created by windows users end up with 600 permissions and are not readable by others.\nWhile not an answer, hopefully it will give someone a step closer to finding it.\n", "Q: An alternative to the text editor TextMate for PHP development? I am fed up with the text editor TextMate. It's great, but it's old and keeps crashing on me. No development in (what, 3+?) years, etc.\nSo I'm looking for a viable alternative, mainly for PHP development. However, I don't want a bloated and slow editor that runs on Java (so NetBeans, Komodo, Eclipse, etc are out), nor something that includes the kitchen sink (goodbye Coda, I already own Espresso but am extremely disappointed that after latest version doesn't include variable autocompletion). BBEdit is a little too bare bones for me.\nIn summary, as the title says, a TextMate replacement that is modern, stable and still in development. Does such an editor exist?\n\nA: Have a look at Sublime Text. It basically is what I would expect TextMate2 to be.\nhttp://www.sublimetext.com/\n\nA: MacVIM + the Janus Plugins\nFear not the VIM. MacVIM gives you visual VIM that's OS X friendly. All the usual suspects work (Cmd+S, Cmd+W, etc.). And the Janus plugins give you nice addons like a side drawer for projects, etags/ctags without even having to know what that is, TAB key completion and more.\nIt's really very good. It lowers the VIM learning curve by a massive amount.\nThe MacVIM is getting good amounts of active development. It had full-screen Lion support within days of Lion being out the door. I can't tell you how nice full screen Lion MacVIM coding is. You really have to experience the joy and wonder of it for yourself. It's very distraction free, let me say that.\nIt's free to try so you're not out any money if you decide it really isn't for you.\n\nKomodo or (Komodo Edit)\nI used, and loved, Komodo v4 for years in my last job. I liked it's big, old IDE-ness at the time and that it looked and (nearly) behaved the same on Linux and Windows -- the two platforms I had to switch between during the course of a development day. I used it mainly for Perl and Tcl development. But it bundles in a ton of support for PHP.\nIt is not a Java application. Most definitely v4 is a native binary on OS X. I just fired up my old v4 copy to verify this.\nIt runs fast, but not as fast as something like TextMate or MacVIM because it is, after all, trying to be a big old IDE. And big old IDEs try to do lots of project-level analysis and integrations and scanning and what not to give you that big old IDE experience. That being said, it wasn't that slow.\nKomodo Edit is free. I used the paid version.\nI gave up the whole IDE thing when I switched to OS X full time for development. My tool chain still looks pretty much like this answer I posted to a similar question over here. I use MacVIM more and more now that TextMate though.\n\nA: Keep an eye on Chocolat. It's still in beta, but I think I read it supports Textmate bundles (not sure).\nYou can also try to ping the developpers on Twitter to have an early access. If you plead your case correctly, they will probably send you an invite.\n\nA: I never had any exposure to TextMate but I'm quite comfortable with SubEthaEdit. It's most prominent selling point is the ability to collaboratively work on documents over a network connection but even this is not your main interest it serves very well as a general-purpose file editor, offers syntax-coloring suport for many languages, can be customized, comes with scripting support, etc.\n\nA: I exclusively use emacs for all of my text editing, be it programming, scripting, note taking or paper/documentation writing.  I usually run within the terminal with emacs -nw a the command line, but there are several GUI apps for emacs on OS X (e.g. Aquamacs or Carbon emacs).  There is,  however a slight learning curve -- I've been using emacs for the past 6 years or so and am daily learning new commands/tricks.\nThere are numerous extra packages/plugins (usually called \"modes\") for almost anything you can think of needing - and if there isn't, emacs is completely extendable as it is just a lisp interpreter.\nOne particular mode I have found lately to be extremely useful is org-mode, which was originally designed for note-taking and organization but has grown enormously to handle all sorts of projects from publishing professional webpages to using LaTeX and beamer to create presentations.  In fact, I wrote my entire dissertation and defense presentation using org-mode.\n\nA: TextMate 2 is open sourced on github now.\n\nA: Brackets supports plugins and is under heavy development, and is open-source.  They recently released 1.0.\n\nA: After using BBedit on the Mac and then Notepad++ on the PC I have now migrated to Sublime Text which I cannot recommend highly enough.\nThis is a genuinely cross platform application (native not java) with a large and active community (Will Bond hosts the excellent Package Control plugin repository)\nWhat is especially useful is the license is registered to the user, so a single user can install Sublime on both a Mac & PC quite legally.\n\nA: In the end, thanks to posts here, I bought SublimeText and used it for a couple of years, it's great if a bit quirky. I highly recommend it. \nI've since moved on to Ruby development and am now using Rubymine which is incredible. If you do any Ruby development check it out.\nChocolat looked good but missing too many features and very slow development. Espresso a complete disappointment.\n", "Q: Installing OpenConnect, Cisco VPN alternative Has anyone had any luck installing openconnect on OS X?

I really hate the blue-purple color of the Lion (and Snow Leopard before it) menu bar selection. Isn't there some way to change this? I've tried tweaking everything, but Apple seems to have decided that we should all use this absurdly bright color unless we want to go totally monochrome and use Graphite (which I don't). I assume the same fix should apply to Snow Leopard.\n\nA: System preferences > General > Appearance > [Blue|Graphite]\n\nGraphite will turn menu selection co\nlor to dark grey. Of course it's system wide so it also will change the color for other UI elements.\n\nModding\nYou will need :\n\n\n*\n\n*SArtFileTool\n\n*image editor\n\n*a good backup ;-)\n\n\nDownload SArtFileTool into ~/Downloads/SArtFile then copy and decompress the system art resource file :\ncd ~/Downloads/SArtFile\ncp /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Resources/SArtFile.bin ./\n./sartfiletool -d SArtFile.bin artfiles\n\nGo into the artfiles directory and find 52.png 68.png 71.png files and modify them.\n\n\n*\n\n*52.png = \"Blue\" top menu text selection color\n\n*68.png = \"Blue\" menu item text selection color\n\n*71.png = \"Blue\" help menu item \"Search\" background color\n\n\nThen recreate SArtFile.bin and put into place :\n./sartfiletool -e artfiles SArtFile.bin SArtFile.new.bin\nsudo cp SArtFile.new.bin /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Resources/SArtFile.bin\n\nLogout & log in again, menu should look something like this (I cheated and used the turquoise-ish files from \"Lion Pulse\" mod.)\n\nAdditional remarks:\nThe SArtFile is poorly documented for Lion, here's the explanation of the contents for Snow Leopard but Lion's is different.\nThe selection in Finder is still the harsher blue, haven't looked into that yet.\n", "Q: Mission Control has no spaces, background image doesn't change and Launchpad background is dark I just ran a system update on Lion and after the reboot I got issues with Mission Control.\nNamely,\n\n\n*\n\n*When I trigger Mission Control, it only shows windows on current space and doesn't provide a way to add or switch between spaces. The whole top bar is missing.\n\n*When I trigger Launchpad, it shows on a background that has nothing to do with the desktop background image, as if the underlying image was black.\n\n*Changing background image in Preferences doesn't take effect until a restart.\n\n\nThis is very frustrating and seems like a bug. How do I fix this?\n\nA: Seems like I'm not the first one to hit into this issue, and it is related to Dock process working incorrectly. The easiest way to fix this is to type \nkillall Dock\n\ninto the Terminal, which will effectively relaunch Dock process (and hopefully fix the problem).\nIf this doesn't work, reportedly trashing Dock preferences and attempting several restarts may help.\n\nA: If literally just installed Lion in the past 30 minutes then you need to give the system time to \"settle.\" I noticed a lot of the same issues immediately after upgrading from Snow Leopard and they all resolved themselves with a bit of time.\n", "Q: Using Mission Control to switch between Safari and a full-screen Keynote presentation I'm on a MacBook Pro running Lion. During a Keynote presentation that's running in full screen, I'd like to be able to switch to a different desktop with the four-finger-swipe gesture to demonstrate a Web site with Safari. \nI tried putting Keynote on desktop 1 and Safari on desktop 2, and then starting the slide show.  The slideshow appears full screen as usual. If I swipe over to desktop 2, Safari is there, but the screen blanks for a moment. When I return to desktop 1, the slideshow isn't there. Keynote is running in the Dock, but no slide appears.\nThis seems like a pretty common thing to want to do, but I can't figure out how to cleanly swap between the full-screen slide and another app.  We used to Cmd-Tab between Keynote and Safari, but when returning to Keynote, the slide would rebuild instead of being where it had ended up. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Make sure you have \"Allow Exposé, Dashboard and others to use the screen\" in keynote preferences under Slideshow.\nThen, before you slide over to Safari, press the \"F\" key to pause the slideshow. This prevents the slideshow from disappearing.\nYou can then slide over, or use Mission Control, etc without affecting the slideshow.\n\nThere is a bug here, to go back to the slideshow you have to slide back to it or click on the desktop in Mission Control; you can't click the Dock icon or Cmd-Tab back to it.\n(Clicking the dock icon / cmd-tabbing will just hide the dock and menubar but not take you back to the presentation)\nAlso: When you get back to the slideshow, the first key press or mouse click unpauses the presentation, so you will have to click / press again to advance to the next slide.\n\nSide note: instead of having keynote and Safari on separate desktops, you can have them both as fullscreen apps. This hides the Dock and Menubar, so when you show the web page, there is more room for it.\n\nA: I am using Keynote 6.5.3 and Cmd-Tab works fine to switch between applications.\n", "Q: Add an up button to the Finder? Is it possible to add a button to the Finder that goes up a directory? I looked at the buttons available under customize and didn't see one, but thought there might be a hack out there.\n\nA: Another option would be to save a script like this as an application in AppleScript Editor and drag it to the toolbar.\ntry\n    tell app \"Finder\" to tell window 1 to set target to container of target\nend try\n\n\nA: I found this app that does what I was looking for. Once extracting it to your Applications folder or wherever you want to keep it, drag it to the Finder next to the Back/Forward buttons. It's a little bit smaller than them in Lion, but the styling fits.\nClick here to download\nCredit to Simon Slangen for creating the app\n\n\nA: When you Command-Click on the folder icon on an item in the title bar of a Finder window, you get a contextual menu showing the folder hierarchy to the root of the drive. You can then use the mouse to select a higher level of the hierarchy and move there in the Finder window. It's convenient and appealing because you see the whole hierarchy.\n\n\n\nA: You can make a simple Automator app to do this and put it's icon in the tool bar. It may be slightly slower than an AppleScript app, but the Automator app won't change the focus of the window when it launches (the current Finder window remains the active window the whole time), so it has a more integrated feel. \nStill, the quickest way is definitely to use Cmd+Up Arrow.\nIn Automator, add a \"Run Applescript\" action and replace the entire default script with this:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    tell application \"System Events\" to key code 126 using command down\nend tell\n\nThis script simply sends Cmd+Up Arrow to the Finder. \nSave your Automator app, then drag its icon to the Finder's tool bar. You may want to first make a new icon for it to indicate its function.\n\n\nA: The current solution I'm using is XtraFinder which lets you add an up button as well as do many of the things that PathFinder or TotalFinder let you do (like sort folders to the top) but for free.\n\n\nA: Would you be willing to just use a keyboard shortcut instead?\n⌘ Command↑ Up\nVoilà.\n\nA: Choose View > Show Path Bar to show the Path bar at the bottom of Finder windows.\nThen, to go up one level, just double-click on the second-to-last item in the hierarchy. For example, I'd double-click on mdouma46 in the image below to go up one level.\n\n\nA: I made an App for up button.\nhttp://autometa.ro/apps/up_button.html\nIt is free.\nthx.\n", "Q: Can I use outlook web access with mail app on iphone 4? My company runs an exchange server which also provides outlook web access.\nThe thing is that I cannot connect using activesync from the iphone because the exchange server is only reachable through a VPN. But OWA is not, so I can use it with safari.\nIs there any way to configure the mail app to connect using OWA instead of activesync/exchange somehow?\n\nA: I don't believe the mail app can work with OWA. If you cannot build the exchange account in the normal fashion do to the vpn being required then the server that hosts the exchange mail app on the iPhone is likely out of the picture. \nCan you not use the safari browser to access the web location for your companies mail service? The company I work for has the Outlook web access page available mail.company.edu for example. When I go to the page it loads up and allows access. Sadly this is the only way I can think of. \nMaybe someone else will have a work around for you but in the IT field I deal with Exchange accounts a lot and the best option would be to have a mail service that can be reached without a vpn required. Perhaps your companies IT can provide more information on accessing the exchange mail server.\n\nA: No - Mail on an iOS device doesn't support OWA. You might be able to connect via IMAP, but only if your server is configured to support IMAP.\nHave you tried setting up the VPN on your iPhone itself? That may solve your problem.\n", "Q: Transfer Audio output of my MacBook wirelessly What is the best way to output the sound of my macbook to my hifi system without using the headphone jack? Is there a way to use bluetooth or airplay or whatever to output all sound (and I mean not only iTunes Music) ?\nWhat hardware do I need for this?\nSince Airfoil has a very high latency, is there another solution that has a latency under 1 second?\n\nA: I now found a good solution. The Belkin Bluetooth Receiver. It only costs 30$. Way cheaper than the AirPort+Airfoil Solution. AND it only has 100-400ms latency. Cheaper, faster and better sound.\nBut one final note:\nYou have to change the bluetooth settings a bit to make it sound perfect. Disable bluetooth, add the following lines and reboot.\ndefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Apple Bitpool Max (editable)\" 80 \ndefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Apple Bitpool Min (editable)\" 48 \ndefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Apple Initial Bitpool (editable)\" 40 \ndefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Negotiated Bitpool\" 58 \ndefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Negotiated Bitpool Max\" 58 \ndefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Negotiated Bitpool Min\" 48 \n\n\nA: Airfoil is probably your best bet as far as software goes. It's an app that captures any sound from your machine and beams it to a variety of devices: iOS devices, other Macs, and Airplay devices such as an Apple TV or Airport Express.\nAs for the hardware, some hi-fi systems are starting to build in Airplay (which is the new wireless audio protocol Apple has introduce). If you don't want to buy a whole new stereo, I'd buy an Apple TV. $99 bucks for wireless audio and video is a pretty good bargain in my book. And, more and more apps and devices will take advantage of Airplay (including video Airplay) as iOS 5 rolls around.\nYou could also use an Airport Express, but that would limit you to audio only.\n\nA: If you have a newer Mac with Mountain Lion you can also use it's built in AirPlay functionality.\nSupported models as announced by Apple.\n\nAirPlay Mirroring requires a second-generation Apple TV or later, and\n  is supported on the following Mac models: iMac (Mid 2011 or newer),\n  Mac mini (Mid 2011 or newer), MacBook Air (Mid 2011 or newer), and\n  MacBook Pro (Early 2011 or newer).\n\nGo to System Preferences->Sound and select Apple TV from the Output tab. This will play all system sound from your Mac.\nYou can probably do this on per App basis also, but I haven't done this my self. You can find an article about this from here: http://joris.kluivers.nl/blog/2012/07/25/per-application-airplay-in-mountain-lion/\n\nA: This is what the Apple Airport Express hardware WiFi network device was designed to do.\n\nAirPlay takes the music from the iTunes library on your computer and\n  sends it wirelessly to any stereo or speakers in your home. All you\n  have to do is plug an AirPort Express into an electrical outlet near\n  those speakers, then connect them with an audio cable (sold\n  separately).\n\nApple Airport Express will work with any stereo hifi audio system with audio line inputs. That's what makes it versatile and useful. It does not require the latest audio systems that incorporate AirPlay.\n", "Q: Apache bonjour module and Sites folder template I just upgraded to Lion and because I do web design, first thing I did was turning on Web Sharing to get Apache running. While checking the logs I found that the Bonjour module can't find a file and warns me about this:\nmod_bonjour: Cannot stat template index file '/System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/Sites/index.html'\n\nSo I listed the files under that location and it seems the whole Sites folder is gone. I found out later that Mac OS X doesn't include that folder under your user account by default.\nI'm still wondering how to stop this warnings. Is it safe to create a directory under this system location? I wouldn't like to do that.\nI tried commenting\nRegisterUserSite customized-users\n\nunder /etc/apache2/other/bonjour.conf thinking the error was due to the bonjour module trying to compare my index.html with the system template to activate my personal site but it didn't work.\nAny ideas?\nThank you!\n\nA: I was getting the same warning.\nI did the following:\nsudo mkdir \"/System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/Sites/\"\nsudo touch \"/System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/Sites/index.html\"\n\napache now starts without the warning\n", "Q: How to re-download Lion to create a VMWare Fusion 4 virtual machine? I have a MacBook with Lion installed.\nI bought VMWare Fusion 4 because I want to create a Lion VM.\nAs far as I can tell I need to point VMWare to the Lion installer that is downloaded from the App Store, but that file deleted itself after Lion was installed.\nHow do I re-download the Lion installer (and keep it around) to create a VMWare Fusion 4 virtual machine?\n\nA: What you need to do to re-download the Lion installer is to HOLD down the OPTION/ALT key whilst opening the App Store and keep holding it all the way through to the purchased tab, from here you should see the option to install. Just download that. \n\n", "Q: Disable the \"None of your preferred networks are available\" dialog on OS X How do I disable that horribly annoying dialog that tells me I am not connected to any wifi network?\n\n\nNone of your preferred networks are available.\nChoose the Wi-Fi network you want to join from the list below.\n\n\nEdit:\nI use the wifi.\nSo why do I want the dialog gone?\n\n*\n\n*The dialog only shows up when I have no internet connection. Great. That dialog won't magically help me know encryption keys to random networks I am around. There is only like one time that it was useful, and thats the first time I ever turned this machine on.\n\n*The dialog is annoying.\n\n*The dialog has zero uses. I can use the status bar icon to do all the needed work that the dialog provides, except I get to chose when to stop and use it, not the dialog choosing \"stop what ur doing and connect to the f-ing internet\"\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the Network pane of the System preferences.\n\n*Select AirPort in the list on the left.\n\n*Uncheck the “Ask to join new networks” checkbox. \n\n*Et voilà!  :)\n\n\nA: There are two options that I could see that might work for you Uncheck ask to join new networks and try unchecking show wifi status in bar. These are options available in the Network Preferences. You could also try to set the wifi service to inactive. Click the service cog at the bottom left while the wifi service is selected.\nIf all else fails just turn the wifi off. I assume you aren't using it since you want to disable the warnings and you know its not connected.\n", "Q: Documents to Go for iPad Quick question that I just can not seem to find an answer for. I am wondering whether or not when using Documents to Go on my iOS device (iPad 2), if I open a file in safari, will this app help safari render the .doc or .ppt, whatever office format, correctly. Currently it can open the file but it does display the information and equations that are present in the document.\nDoes anyone know if this is the case? I want to know before I go and buy the app and am disappointed in its functionality. If this application does not do what I am asking, does anyone know of an app that can do this?\nThanks in advance for any advice!\n\nA: Docs to Go doesn't improve the rendering of the .doc or .ppt in Safari on the iPad, but it  does register with the system as a compatible app for the file type. Tapping in the document area reveals an action bar with two buttons: Open in  (which depends on the apps you have installed), and an Open in... button, which when tapped, gives you a popover with compatible apps. \nSee this example:\n\nIn my experience, you would be better off using Docs to Go to render the documents in any case, as the fidelity of its Office document rendering is quite good.\n\nA: No. Safari's behaviour remains unchanged. Documents to Go (as are all 3rd party apps on iOS) is completely encapsulated (sandboxed). However, since apps can register certain document types, you will see places were iOS will allow you to open your MS Office documents using Documents to Go. But as you can see, that is the only level of \"integration\" provided.\n\nYou can watch this YouTube video of a complete rundown on Documents to Go for the iPad.\n", "Q: Can I open files in TextEdit from the Terminal in Mac OS X? I frequently find that a Terminal command to open a file in TextEdit would be very handy. Does such a command exist on Mac OS X?\n\nA: The open command can be used to open files (in their default apps, unless using the -a flag), URLs (in your default web browser), and directories (in Finder).\nAn example would be\nopen /Users/Example/Desktop/example.rtf\n\n\nA: Direct, easy answer - add an alias to your ~/.bash_profile like: \nalias textedit='open -a TextEdit'\n\nInvoke it like: \ntextedit theFiletoEdit.txt\n\nThe difference between this and the other answer, is you can easily remember it when you want it. Typing text and Tab to autocomplete it will make it instantly available \n\nFor those with a bit more bash background, who want the reasoning without having to fuss with figuring it out:  \n\n\n*\n\n*The problem is that a trivial symlink (or its ilk, like a shell script redirect) to  /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit causes a new instance of TextEdit to open the file you pass to it. This works, but does not give your expected Mac OS X default behavior.  (if you try it, you'll see) \n\n*To get the default UI behavior, using the Mac built-in open command, with that '-a TextEdit' flag (that others mentioned) induces the Mac UI to have (any) currently running instance of TextEdit handle the call (with no inapropos 'sudo' needed for general case usage).\n\nA: For those finding this post:\nThe solution was to use the command  sudo open -t /path/file.txt \nAnd the man pages for the open command also show how to do some other things like show the file in the finder.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/open.1.html\n\nA: open -a TextEdit filename should do the trick.\nThe -a flag specifies any application you want, so it's applicable to any number of situations, including ones where TextEdit isn't the default editor.\nOther relevant options\n\n*\n\n*-t  opens in the default editor (i.e. if you use BBEdit, TextMate, etc.)\n\n*-e will open the file specifically in TextEdit\n\n\nA: This is not a programming question. But I did a quick google and found this site:\nhttp://ss64.com/osx/ \nhttp://ss64.com/osx/pico.html pico: Simple text editor\nhttp://ss64.com/vi.html vi: Text Editor\nAnd this site explains how to use TextEdit from terminal.\nhttp://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2754/os_x_edit_file_using_textedit_as_root_superuser/\n", "Q: Is there a way to force US keyboard layout in Safari address bar? I keep typing in Russian keyboard layout into Safari address bar by accident.\nThis drives me mad because I usually end up loading domain-for-sale pages.\n\nIs there an extension or program to switch keyboard layout to US on ⌘+L before letting me enter the URL?\n\nA: If you are using exactly two keyboard layouts, you can toggle between them with Command-Space if it is activated in the Language & Text System Preference. With that enabled, perhaps you could write a macro or Applescript to invoke that command along with Command-L.\n\n\n\nA: Turns out, there is a program called Punto Switcher that does exactly that.\n\nIt puts a global hook on keyboard events and triggers automatic input switch (which is configurable) as soon as it detects nonsense being typed. Rather than relying on application types and input fields, it uses a dictionary (e.g. пщщпдуюсщь is recognized as mistyped google.com).\nIt also has a neat feature of “transcoding” mistyped words into another layout by pressing ⌥.\n", "Q: Lion drag and drop with trackpad? I have tap to click enabled. Is there a gesture that I can use to drag and drop? (especially in Finder). I do not want to over-ride the new three finger swipe for dektop change.\n\nA: In Lion, you can enable traditional trackpad dragging in System Preferences > Universal Access > Mouse & Trackpad (tab) > Trackpad Options (button at bottom). You can also choose whether to use Drag Lock.\nThis is also where you go for various scrolling options (enable/disable, inertia, speed).\n\nA: You could click the button (the hardware trackpad button, thumb works best) to \"lock\" onto something and then move another finger around to drag around.\n", "Q: How do I save ftp.plist file when using sudo nano?

Every hour or so (I'm not actually sure about this pattern), the application that I am using will suddenly freeze. I will then hear my external hard drive spin up, and eventually, the application will begin to work again.\nAs an example, simply right-clicking on something in Chrome or half-way through watching a video in Plex will cause the entire application to freeze until the disk is spinning again. I can't think how these applications could possibly rely on this external disk, as all I use it for is my Time Machine back-up.\nI have disabled the \"put hard disks to sleep when possible\" option, but this doesn't appear to have fixed anything. One possible explanation could be that this external disk is being used as part of virtual memory; it would explain the OS's reliance on the disk, but I can't imagine why it would do that when I have plenty of disk space remaining on my system drive.\nThis isn't entirely fatal, it's more annoying than anything else, but I am concerned that this could indicate that something is wrong with my operating system or hardware. I would be grateful for any ideas.\n\nA: It might be the Spotlight indexing. Do you see mdworker active in Activity Monitor when this happens? If you have not done this yet, you might try excluding the drive in the Spotlight Privacy settings in System Preferences and see if that helps.\n\nA: Sounds like it's Time Machine doing it's scheduled backup, it would slow down your current process as it checks your home folder for changes. \n\nA: I would say that the external drive has it's own internal power management that is causing the disk to spin down.  With some effort you could write a script that writes a file to the external drive, deletes it and then repeats every minute.  \nIf you have any apps on the external drive, and especially an app that once registered a service, then I suspect your external drive is spinning up on a right click in order to help build the services menu.  Or it could simply be that Plex itself is choosing to scan the external drive.\nI'd research your external drive a bit and see if it spins down the disk on its own and then how to prevent it from happening.\nThis script\n #!/bin/bash\n # Used to not let a volume named MYBOOK sleep\n\n volpresent=$(mount | grep MYBOOK | wc -c)\n\n if [ $volpresent -gt 0 ]\n then\n    touch /Volumes/MYBOOK/.hiddenfile\n fi\n\nComes from this hint http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090316190817357\n\nA: Focus on one action that seems to both (a) cause a disk to spin up and (b) not complete until after spin up is complete. Assuming that a right-click in Google Chrome is one such action … \nIn Terminal, running the following command before a right-click in Google Chrome will show things relating to file activity:\nsudo fs_usage cmd Google\\ Chrome\nAmongst the activity, something related to Services. Run the following command to get an idea of just some of the services available to your system: \ndefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ServicesMenu.Services\nMight one of those applications, those services cause both (a) and (b)?\nIf not a right-click in Google Chrome, think of ways in which the main question might be more focused. \n\nA: I have a hard drive that does this too. I suspect that the drive spins down if it's not needed for a while. However, when the OS tries to read from or write to the drive, it blocks the process while the drive spins up. And in Lion, this happens sometimes when I use Spotlight, Finder, or click on a stack in the Dock. I've resigned myself to the fact that this behavior is just part of how Lion operates.\n", "Q: Reformatting and restoring just data on Lion I have a Time Machine backup but, as I understand it, it backs up everything. I wish to do a reformat to get rid of a lot of useless clutter I have, a lot of which I'm not even sure where it has been installed to! \nThis includes MacPorts where, when I try the uninstall everything command, the computer just hangs. \nDo I need to find my Snow Leopard disk in order to reformat and install Lion? \nIs it easy to just pull out my data, such as from iTunes, Aperture and my documents folder from my Time Machine?\n\nA: This is a broad question in which you need help defining a strategy. \nIf you want a truly clean start, yes, I would consider these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your entire system to a disk image file on an external drive using Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! \n\n*Check all your crucial system settings on the startup disk, such as Internet connection settings and network volume connections. Un-register iTunes, the App Store, and any other applications with copy-protection that need to be un-registered.\n\n*Erase your system hard drive, make a clean install of Snow Leopard, download all Apple updates and security patches. \n\n*Then re-connect the external hard drive, mount the disk image of the backup, and manually drag over only your documents, not any system settings. \n\n*You will then need to laboriously download and re-install all your third-party applications and App Store purchased applications, and re-register them.\n\n*You must then decide what configurations and files from your /Library/ and ~/Library/ need to be migrated from your old disk image to your new system. Making these decisions one-at-a-time rather than using Migration Assistant will ensure that you avoid \"cruft\" or \"useless clutter\".\n\n*Make sure that you retain your backup disk image for quite a while so that you can go back and get more data from it if you discover that you have overlooked something that you need, like fonts or folders in ~/Library/Application Support/.\nI underwent this process myself when I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion. I made this decision because my system had been migrated from Tiger through Leopard to Snow Leopard and had many years of \"cruft\" that I wanted to be free from, particularly some third-party KEXT files where I was not certain what was working correctly and what was not. But going this route takes a tremendous amount of time and attention to detail. You could spend more than one full eight-hour day working with this if your system is as old and complex as mine is.\nSo weigh your options and decide what you want to achieve, and how much time you are willing to devote to it. But make backups of everything first, and retain those backups!\n", "Q: Will Migration assistant erase my Lion setup I just got a new macbook pro. It runs Lion.\nI have a time machine backups of my old snow leopard machine. If I use Migration assistant to move data to new machine via time machine backup, will it erase my Lion OS?

When I tried to configure by myself I don't see the usual \"airport\" option to create the ad-hoc connection.\nHow can I do this in lion OS X?\n\nA: You can only share Internet from an Ethernet, Bluetooh, or FireWire connection over Wi-Fi.\nThat's because you can only use your Wi-Fi connection for one thing at a time. If you're connecting to the Internet over Wi-Fi you won't be able to share that connection over Wi-Fi.\nIf you've got Share your connection from: set to Wi-Fi, it's normal that To computers using: doesn't have a Wi-Fi option:\n\n\nA: Based upon my understanding of your description of the problem, this is not a question of configuring your MacBook Pro.

Something like Connectify or Virtual Router under Windows 7.\nI have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011).\n\nA: AFAIK it's not possible in Mac OS X as it is now.\nWindows tools you've mentioned are probably relying on Windows 7 native ability to create ad-hoc WPA-protected networks. There is no support for that in Mac OS X and since WPA encryption on ad-hoc network is not defined by the WPA standard it will probably never be.\n", "Q: Renaming the startup disks shown during boot I'm dual booting OS X (Lion) and Arch Linux, and when I hold down \"option\" during the boot process, I am presented with both of my startup disk options (i.e., OS X and Linux); however, they are named \"IluvatarHD\" and \"Windows\". Does anybody know of a way to rename the \"Windows\" option to something more accurate.\nI assume this is on the Mac OS X side as nowhere on my Arch install is the label \"Windows\"  applied.\nIn an ideal world, I would be able to change the disk icon as well...\nNOTE: I've uninstalled refit as it's unnecessary once Arch has been installed and would rather keep using the Apple boot loader.\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Maybe I'm missing the subtleties here, but it should be as simple as:\ndiskutil rename /Volumes/oldvolumename newvolumename\n\n\nA: I'm fairly certain this isn't possible.  The EFI boot loader just assumes that if it isn't an OS X partition then it must be Windows.\n\nA: Try the following command in Terminal if you can mount the devices directly in MacOSX\nsudo bless --folder \"volume_path\" -label \"volume_label\"\n\nOtherwise try the following option:\nsudo bless --device \"device_path\" -label \"volume_label\"\n\nfound it via apples man pages: Bless Man Page.\nHope it works.\n\nA: This is a quirk of the Mac bootloader. While Mac and newer Windows volumes are booted via the native EFI system, older operating systems (like Windows XP and 32-bit Windows 7) require BIOS support to boot, which is provided in the firmware by the CSM (compatibility support module). Any volumes that are bootable via BIOS are always shown with the label \"Windows\". \n", "Q: Mac OS X Lion Finder Window Size I know that when I close a finder window the next time it opens, it will open at the same size.\nThis works with me for a while, but sometimes all the finder windows just go back to the default size (Small window) except for the Macintosh HD folder!\nWhy is that? How can I fix it? It is VERY annoying.\n\nA: Whenever you close all finder windows, the last window closed seems to determine the default size for new finder windows. By 'new finder windows' I mean those created with the Command + N shortcut. If you happen to Command + double click on a folder to open it in a new window it does not always respect this 'default size'.\n\nA: If you hold down option while resizing the window and then close it, the next time you open it from the dock it will open at the new default size.\nYou will need to do this with the other ways of opening the finder window, such as clicking the HD icon on the desktop of after closing a window going to file -> new finder window.\nOnce these have all been done you will not have to do it again.\n\nA: Set your favourite Finder window size and then go to Finder's menu: View -> Show View Options (you can also change settings in this window) and finally click \"Use as Defaults\".\n\nA: There is a bug in some versions of OS X where if you move even a small part of the window off screen before closing it then, when next you open that folder, it will reset to the built in os x default position and size. (I've tested 10.9-Mavericks and 10.10-Yosemite)\nAfter confirming this issue for yourself you can report the bug at bugreport.apple.com\nBy the way, this is made more complicated if you have multiple screens of differing sizes. Say you have a macbook pro 13 inch attached to a 27 inch iMac type display, now size a window as desired on that screen and put it in the centre of the 27 inch screen. When you next open that folder window on the MacBook Pro's built in screen it would be, positioned from the top left corner, now somewhat off screen; the size and location resets.\nI noticed this issue when I started using one 4k display with a few other much smaller screens. Since discovering this issue I try to keep my finder windows completely within the top left quadrant of the 4k monitor, or completely within the bounds of the other smaller displays.\n\nA: Make sure you have a password (make one if not - SystemPreferences:Users&Groups).\nLaunch Terminal from Applications:Utilities\nClose all Finder windows.\nAt the UNIX shell prompt enter the following UNIX command:\nsudo find /-name \".DS_Store\" -depth -exec rm {} \\;\n\nWhen prompted for a password enter the Mac OS X Administrator password.\nThis command is to find and remove all occurrences of .DS_Store starting from the root (/) of the file system through the entire machine.\n\nIf the problem still remains with particular window, you will need to copy any DS_Store file in that directory manually.\nEnter the following UNIX command:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\n\nThen:\nkillall Finder\n\nOpen Finder window and copy DS_Store file. Then paste it to the directory which had previously displayed is not correct.\nEnter the following UNIX command:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false\n\nThen:\nkillall Finder\n\n\nSo this way I fixed the bug with displaying the size of windows on my computer (Mac OS X 10.7.2).\n", "Q: How do I unset an IP address set with ifconfig?

What is the difference between cron and lauchd? I have always used cron, but I have recently heard that launchd is better. Why? In what ways is cron better? In what ways is launchd better?\n\nA: launchd does a lot more than cron.  In addition to running programs at certain times, it can also run them based on other triggers: incoming network connection, when a file is added to a certain folder, etc.  It can also relaunch a program if it crashes.\nIf you're interested in it specifically as a replacement for cron, the main difference is how it handles being asleep or shut down when a job is scheduled to run.  In this case, cron simply doesn't run the job, but launchd will notice that a scheduled run has been missed, and run it at the next opportunity (although if it's missed multiple scheduled runs, it'll only run it once).\nEdit: I should also point out some things that cron can do that launchd cannot: automatic emailing of failure reports (you'd have to write a wrapper script to do this with launchd) and user-defined jobs that run even when the user isn't logged in (a user can define launchd items in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, but they only run inside a login session).\n", "Q: How to coerce Lion Time Machine into offering backup history migration? This article describes a feature I heard about from multiple sources about an automagic backup migration process that Lion will do for you. Essentially, when migrating to a new machine, you can maintain your backup history and use the same backup drive on your new machine.\nI recently had to do a double migration (both a new machine and a larger backup hard drive), so maybe that's why this didn't go as smoothly as I hoped. I used the old backup drive to restore with migration assistant on first boot, then used Disk Utility to clone my old backup drive to my new one.\nHowever, Lion would not present the \"Use Previous Disk\"/\"Inherit Backup History\" dialogs seen in the link above and below.\n\n\nInstead, I was only presented with the prompt to use my new drive as a backup disk. I noted that it was creating a new entry in Backups.backupdb, since the computer name had changed, so I attempted to hack this by going into System Preferences/Sharing and renaming the new computer exactly the same as the previous one. (for some reason, the pre-Lion system had been named First Last’s Computer and the new system was named First's Computer Note the difference between ’ and '!)\nAnyway, this is now backing up to the correct backupdb, but I don't believe it's hard linking properly as it would if \"Inherit Backup History\" had been executed; it's copying the whole drive's worth of data over instead. I suppose this means I will have the history at least, but it's not as seamless as it should be. (It hardly matters for the record; It was only about 60G worth of data now on a 1T drive.)\nIt also now occurs that the \"right way\" to do this would have been to clone my backup to my new backup drive BEFORE upgrading the computer and restoring from the backup.\nAnyway, the answer to this question will dig into the nitty-gritty of how time machine keeps track of itself and explain how to force the daemon to present the dialog boxes above.\n\nA: You can't get that dialog back, but you can inherit the backup manually via Terminal using the tmutil command. Do man tmutil for more information.\nExample:\n$ sudo tmutil inheritbackup \"/Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/iMac\"\n\nFor more information, see the blue box here: http://Pondini.org/TM/B6.html and you would do well to read the whole page before starting the process.\n", "Q: Can I start an application as another user without actually switching users?

I'm shopping for a 17-inch MacBook Pro and trying to figure out my minimum specs.\nFrom the Apple website it appears these are the two procesor options...\n\n2.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with 6MB shared L3 cache; or optional 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with 8MB shared L3 cache\n\nDo the additional .1 Ghz and 2 MB of cache make the 2.3 Ghz model noticeably faster?\n(I do understand that HD access is usually the biggest bottleneck, but for my particular tasks CPU speed does make a difference.)\n\nA: Even in CPU-intensive tasks, the difference is going to be more of the \"noticeable in synthetic benchmarks\" variety, rather than \"I see it in the real world\" variety. I'd save the money and put it first towards an SSD option, then more RAM.\nProcessor speed is almost flat these days, so minor bumps aren't worth the money.\nMy very aging MacPro got a new lease on life when I replaced the boot disk with an SSD earlier this year. There's nothing better for improving perceived responsiveness.\n\nA: Without knowing what you intend to use the system for, the increase in performance is going to minimal, even with the turboboost. For the difference in price you should the money into more RAM. Also, configuring it to with an SSD will have noticeable performance over a standard HDD.\nHere's comment from someone who purchased the 2.3 Ghz model:\n\nA very small minority will need this, for whatever reason, and for\n  them it is worth it. For everyone else, do not bother and get the 2.2.\n  The extra money is better spent elsewhere.\nI have the 2.3, HR AG, but got a good deal so am sticking with it.\n\n\nA: The difference (however minute it is) will only be seen when the process is the bottleneck, and it's pushed to 100% load.

I'm dual-purposing a new Mac mini (2011) as a desktop machine and media center. I will be using a DisplayPort to DVI adapter to use with the desktop monitor, and a long HDMI cable to go directly to an HDTV at the other end of the room.\nWhat can I expect from this configuration, when the usage pattern is going to be limited to one display at a time? Meaning, at any one time it will either be used as an HDTV source with the HDMI display or a desktop machine with the DisplayPort display. Obviously I'd like to avoid unplugging/replugging cables all the time to disable the displays, and I would probably not like to mirror 1080p to a 1600x900 desktop display.\nChanging the audio output from HDMI to internal I can handle with an option-click to the sound menu extra, but there's no such functionality to switch from one connected display to the other that I know of.\nIs there anything that I'm missing? Any software that might accomplish this for me?\nAnything completely different that might work better?\n\nA: Your \"best practices\" will depend a lot on your usage and expected behaviour. It sounds like your preferred option would be to keep both plugged in, but have an option to disable one display at a time. Unfortunately I've not found a way to do this, but there are a few tips and tricks you can use to make things more manageable.\nThe first is Gather Windows. It's an option in the display preferences that will move all open windows to whichever display you click it on (you get one window on each display). Useful for switching between displays.\nIf you use VLC, you can set a default screen to use for fullscreen video, under Video > Fullscreen Video Device and choose a screen. Then no matter what display the video opens on, when you full screen it, it will jump to the screen of your choice (presumably you'd set it to your HDTV).\nFinally, you may find Moom useful. It's a great $5 app that gives you a bunch of window management options. You can get a demo to check it out. You can set hot keys for actions or use a nice pop-over that appears from the Zoom Titlebar button. Very configurable and useful, I suspect it would be handy in your case.\n", "Q: PPC Applications on Lion Is there any way to play PPC applications on Lion without running them in a VM?\nThe application in question is Halo Demo.\n\nA: No, there isn't.

Why would I ever want to do that? It would be impossible to control another space with a mouse (scaling issues) so watching a film would be a pain.\nYou want to code and watch a movie at the same time? (Sure it's a good idea?)\nGreat, that's precisely what windows are for.\n\n(Sublime Text 2 running with MPlayerX on top of it.)\nSome media players (amongst them is MPlayerX, the most polished OS X player) always stay on top when playing so you won't have issues with window disappearing as soon as you switch the focus.\nFinally, if you want a window to stay visible regardless of chosen space, right-click its Dock icon and assign it to All Desktops as advised by Andrew in the comment to your question.\n\n\nA: Check out afloat.  Link: http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/\nIt lets you \"float\" one window above others, and customize its appearance to a degree (eg. opacity).

I'm also unable to ping the modem (if I connect to the cable modem directly by ethernet, pointing a browser to http://192.168.100.1 is all that's needed).\nWhat's a good way to debug this problem? I \"can't open the application TELUS High Speed Install Wizard\" (the one that came with the modem) \"because PowerPC applications are no longer supported\" on Lion.\nEdit\nAccording to\nhttp://www.networkoverload.com/forum/networking/turn_your_gigaset_se567_modem_wireless_switch_bridge_mode\none can indeed configure the SE567 as a wireless router, though I don't understand whether  more than one computer could then connect to the network.\nAfter resetting the router, I was able to connect to its configuration at http://192.168.1.254/ (strangely, resetting did not wipe out the previous SSID name).\nAs the page above suggested, one needs to switch to the \"bridge mode\", but after doing so, I can no longer connect to http://192.168.1.254/\nSince this is looking more and more like something that can be resolved by accessing the web servers on the two devices rather than by tinkering through System Preferences \\ Network, it is not quite the right thing to ask on this forum. I will delete the question if it turns out the mac is incidental to the setup.\n\nA: Most cable modems need to be reset after connecting a different device, as they only accept one computer host with a single MAC (Media Access Control) address. So try pulling the power plug.\n\nA: It may be possible to set the Gigaset router up as a generic router, but I am not sure. The Gigaset website states: WAN connectors:  1 (LAN port can be used as WAN port). So it should be possible to use it as a plain old router, ignoring the built-in ADSL modem. However, you will have to determine how to do this. \nWhat you will need to do is connect to the routers built-in configuration web-server. \nDescribing the process of setting up your router is a bit beyond this forum, but your router's manual should be a good place to start. Gigaset has them online here.\n\nAlso, the TELUS configuration utility will do nothing in this situation. Unless they supplied you with an DSL router, the silly automatic setup wizard will have no clue what to do.\n", "Q: Move 'Pictures', 'Documents', 'Movies' etc folders I would like to move folders like 'Pictures', 'Documents', 'Movies' to a different from the default under the root of user's home location, preferably into a sub-folder under the same user's home folder. For example, user/Music would go to user/stuff/Music.\nI'd rather not create symbolic links to moved folders, but change system's behaviour altogether, so it knows where to find those folders.\nPlease bear in mind that I do not want to move user's home folder, but just those ones, for example, move them to /Users/[user name]/stuff/ since I don't like them polluting the home folder there.\n\nA: I personally use symlinks to move all of those directories under my User account. I logged in as root and symlinked all of my directories \"Documents' Downloads \" Movies\", etc and moved them to an external drive. \nMac OS sees the changes just fine and points to those directories (on the external drive) automatically and I have had no issues doing it this way.\nThere is a System Service called SymbolicLinker that will add an option to your context menu that will create a symbolic link for you.\n\nHow to enable the root user\nOS X Lion\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple menu choose System Preferences.... \n\n*From the View menu choose Users & Groups. \n\n*Click the lock and authenticate as an administrator account. \n\n*Click Login Options.... \n\n*Click the \"Edit...\" or    \"Join...\" button at the bottom right. \n\n*Click the \"Open Directory    Utility...\" button. \n\n*Click the lock in the Directory Utility window.    \n\n*Enter an administrator account name and password, then click OK.    \n\n*Choose Enable Root User from the Edit menu. \n\n*Enter the root password you wish to use in both the Password and Verify fields, then click OK.\n\n\nMac OS X v10.6.x\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple menu choose System Preferences....\n\n*From the View menu choose Accounts.\n\n*Click on the lock and authenticate with an administrator account.\n\n*Click Login Options....\n\n*Click the \"Edit...\" or \"Join...\" button at the bottom right.\n\n*Click the \"Open Directory Utility...\" button.\n\n*Click the lock in the Directory Utility window.\n\n*Enter an administrator account name and password, then click OK.\n\n*Choose Enable Root User from the Edit menu.\n\n*Enter the root password you wish to use in both the Password and Verify fields, then click OK.\n\n\nA: You can move your entire user account (home) folder using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Users & Groups in System Preferences.\n\n*Unlock the pane (lock icon).\n\n*Right click on your selected user and choose the \"advanced\" option from the list.\n\n*You will be greeted by the following screen:\n\n\n\nFrom there, simply select the \"home directory\" to which you wish to relocate the profile to, then reboot.\nNote: This will move all the contents found under /Users/{your user}/ (Downloads, Documents, Music, etc.)\n\nA: Well, the short answer is: Don't, because too many things depend on it. This is also the reason why Apple choose to make it difficult to rename these folders. \nIf you want to take the risk anyway, this answer to a somewhat related question should give you some ideas.\n\nA: Interpretation of OP's question\nMy guess is that OP doesn't want to see all of OSX's folders in the $HOME directory when they're in the terminal (like ~/Pictures, ~/Documents, etc.). Those folders are friendly for GUI users but they get in the way for CLI users.\nI don't recommend moving any folders that GUI apps create from the Mac Home directory. This would probably break some things. Pogue's answer is very interesting, but it will probably hide those folders in Finder.\nSolution: Just using a different folder as your CLI workspace\nI offer a simple BASH command to make using the CLI friendlier on OSX.\nSolution: Examples of usage\n\n*\n\n*Type w and hit <Enter> from your Terminal to instantly cd ~/workspace and ls ~/workspace.\n\n*(Whenever you open a shell) You'll automatically navigate to ~/workspace and list the contents.\n\nWhy this solution?\nAs a CLI user, I'm constantly typing cd to return to $HOME, and then doing ls to find the folder I'm looking for.

Goal was to make ls pretend that those folders weren't there but also keep CLI colors in the output. Kind of a mouthful but if you're curious, you can see it in the edits of this answer.\n\nA: Art,\nDo you have this working successfully?\nHave you tried hiding the folders using something like:\nchflags hidden ~/Documents \n\nThen creating a link to it such as (in Terminal):\ncd ~\nmkdir stuff\ncd stuff\nln -s ~/Documents\n\nI believe that this will hide the ~/Documents folder from the Finder but it will still be there so anything writing to it will work OK.  In addition you will see the link in ~/stuff...\n\nA: Just move them wherever you like. The only important one is Library and for the rest you can normally choose where apps place stuff.\nThere's only a few crappy apps that won't allow you to change where they write stuff, Microsoft and Adobe apps come to mind. They will put files in ~/Documents. All the rest will work with your files no matter where you put them. \n\nA: I would not suggest you to move your entire home folder, instead it is better to make symbolic links of your folders to external drive. After that you will get:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flexibility - if something happens with your external HD (remember that your hidden Library folder is on main drive if HDD is down you will need to do something because it will be down too), you will be able to start repairing it right in that moment without turning it off.\n\n*In case if your main drive is SSD - when your home folder is on your main drive it loads up faster, when it would be on external.\n\n*If you have Mac Pro - you can set for movies folder one HD, for music folder another HD...\n\n\nA: I added a Transcend 256G drive in the expansion slot and tried this process but it did NOT move the data.  It DID create a new profile with all the folders relocated to the expansion drive BUT I had to manually move all data from the internal SSD to the new location.  I eventually got what I wanted but I had to recreate the entire profile (Outlook email account, preferences etc).\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcut for moving left/right a space doesn't work After going to:\nPreferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control\nI am able to assign a keyboard shortcut to move left/right a space. However pressing shortcut I assigned does not activate the command. I have tried other keys which are not binded to any other system commands and they do not work as well. Other shortcut are fine \nAny ideas on how to fix this?\nI am running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1.\n\nA: This helped me:\n\nPaste this into Terminal (it's all one line, not two):\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist ~/Desktop/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n\nPress Return and log out/back in again. Then go to System Preferences and set up your hotkeys as you want.\n\nBackground: the plist file can become corrupt. The mv command moves the file to your desktop (you could also directly delete it with rm). Since the file is no longer located in its original location, the operating system creates a new file with default shortcuts\n\nA: This solved the problem for me:\n\n*\n\n*Open the keyboard shortcuts in settings.\n\n*Change the 'move left and move right' for mission control to something new and obscure.\n\n*enable\nand change conflicting shortcuts for desktop 11,12,13 to something\nmore obscure, then disable them again.\n\n*restart the computer.\n\n\nA: Did you have any luck with this? I'm having the same issue with Yosemite. All the shortcuts work except those ones, I try changing them to anything and they still don't work. I even tried assigning \"move right/left a space\" on BetterTouchTools and that doesn't work either, even if the assignment is done by using a touchpad gesture, it seems there is no way to move between workspaces, the only way it works is using a 4 finger drag with the touchpad.\nShortcuts to move to a specific space work without issues. And the shortcuts work on the guest account. Still not working after logging out and back in.\nEdit: Restarting the computer seemed to solved the issue.\nEdit2: Happened again, but I think I finally discovered the reason behind this behaviour. It seems to me it's very strange bug with shortcuts.\nIf you go to the preferences and change the shortcut from ^+→ and ^+← to something like ^+1 and ^+2 you're going to have conflict with the \"Switch to desktop 1/2\" shortcut. That's not really a problem if you disable them.\nOk so you change the shortcut and you disabled the other one and now it works perfectly.\nNow try doing a killall Dock. Tachan! Shortcut is not working! Weird! Nothing you do makes it work, changing the shortcut doesn't work, nothing works!\nNow change the disabled \"Switch to desktop 1/2\" shortcut to something like ⌘+1 and ⌘+2 and to another killall Dock. And tada! The switching is working again!\nWhat's happening? I honestly have no idea, it seems the conflicting shortcuts interfere if the Dock is started with the 2 conflicting shortcuts, even if one of those is disabled.\nEdit3: Created a video explaining how to reproduce the defect, and how to solve it.\n", "Q: Is it safe to buy a MacBook Pro from some guy on eBay? A guy on eBay seems to has a lot of new-in-box machines for sale for much less than you'd pay at the Apple store. In fact he has one with the specs I want.\n(I'll refrain from linking to him as I don't want to seem like I'm advertising for him. But you can turn him up and several similar sellers in a search.)\nThere must be some downside. What am I missing?\nAnd where do these eBay guys get all these newish Macs?\nAlso, this particular seller is offering AppleCare warranties at a discount. Is that even possible? Would Apple honor an extended warrantee they didn't sell themselves?\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: This is a question with an impossible answer. Use the age-old adage \"if it seems to good to be true, it is.\"\nFor the most part, eBay is a mixed bag. It really depends how you shop and what kind of items you are in the market for. Personally, I've been burned far more than I've actually saved and no longer use the service. I will likely give you a biased answer and if pressed, say \"no.\" Unless it's a private seller (which likely won't part with their machine for \"substantially\" less), I would be wary. Apple maintains strict pricing on their products, which is why only marginal price savings can be found.\nAs for where do most people get theses Macs; if they are selling them for substantially less, then you likely won't get a genuine product, or they have likely acquired them illegally.\nAppleCare must be purchased and registered through Apple. No other company can provide you with that kind of coverage. Period. Discounts on the coverage (as with select Apple devices) can be had using their educational discount, which applies to students. And to qualify, the product and the plan must be purchased through their Education Store.\n", "Q: Macbook Air - i5 vs i7 I am buying a Macbook Air and would like to know about the difference between the i5 and the i7 option.

Or is it so small that its not really worth the AU$100 extra?\n\nA: AnandTech did a report comparing the two options and came to the conclusion that there isn't really a noticeable difference.  Just 7-12% improvement on certain benchmark tests.  \nBelow are the figures they got for reference.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA: Technical Details\nI see you are in Australia. There was a recent article published by PC World Australia that goes into some detail on the differences between these processors at a technical level.\nThe i7 has a larger on-chip cache than the i5 (4 MB instead of 3 MB). A larger cache can speed up intensive operations like video encoding.\nMacBook Air 2011 i5 vs. i7\nMac Crazy published an article specifically directed at answering your question with relation to the MacBook Air it was titled, \"MacBook Air 2011 i5 vs i7 – Is the upgrade worth it?\".\nThey include this table detailing the two i5 and single i7 CPUs used in the mid-2011 MacBook Air models.\n\nThere bottom line was this,\n\nPeople who would find the upgrade to the i7 worthwhile would be those\n  doing heavy media work, particularly video encoding, or people who are\n  very speed-sensitive.\n\nI would argue that people who are that speed sensitive would probably do better to buy a MacBook Pro.\nAir vs. Your Current Machine\nI am a designer who makes extensive use of Photoshop and I have been very happy with my recent purchase of a MacBook Air i5.

There are quite a few free media players apps that should be able to browse the Nas. \n\nA: I am not aware of a DLNA player for iPad.  However, if you have a computer in your home that can run iTunes, then add the content that is sitting on the NAS to iTunes (use option+drag so it doesn't copy the file) and then ensure the iPad and iTunes are both using the same account.

Now it is somehow \"Locked\".\nHow can this be fixed?\n\nA: Understanding The Screen Rotation Lock\nApple has a support document that explains this called \"iPad: Understanding the side switch\".\nHere's a quick explanation:\nIf your iPad has version 4.2.1 or later of iOS installed (Settings > General > About > Version) there are two possible ways your screen can be locked.\nThe default is the software lock. To adjust this rapidly click the home button twice. This will reveal a bar below your dock. Swipe the icons that are revealed once to the left to reveal some additional controls. Your screen should look like this:\n\nYou can also enable a hardware lock. This will cause the small switch on the side of your iPad to lock and unlock screen rotation. The setting for this is found in the settings apps here:\n\nIf this setting is set to \"Lock Rotation\" instead of \"Mute\" the software lock will be replaced with a mute button like this:\n\n\nA: Your screen orientation might be locked from the device settings. Try double tapping the home button and scroll the the left. Depending on the OS your iPad uses it with have an orientation lock button.\nEdit: Also a restart of the device might fix any buggy stuff going on if you need to hard reset hold both the power and home buttons till the screen goes dark\n\nA: I have had this happen. You have two possible options:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the lock switch on the side is in the locked position, unlock it. Most people use this as a mute switch, but it can also be used to lock the rotation (and sometimes that setting gets messed up). Check in Settings either way to be sure this isn't part of the problem.\n\n*Do a reset. Hold the power button until the iPad asks if you want to power it off, and then power it off. Wait until it fully shuts down, then hold the power button until it starts up again.\nThis should fix it 99% of the time.\n", "Q: Recommendations for a good Bandwith Tracker on OS X Is there a way I can track total bandwidth usage over the course of a month? My service provider requires me to stay within fairly strict limits.\n\nA: I really like BitMeter OS. It's free, runs as a service and has a slick browser-based interface. It also runs on Windows and Linux.\n\n\nA: If you want to measure it from your Mac: MenuMeters keep a running total of the network volume since last reboot. Of course this total does not differentiate between local and internet traffic so if you have other computers on your LAN you may be better of to measure it directly in the modem/router (which usually has statistics functionality builtin).\n\nA: Probably the most polished app is Rubbernet ($$). Does bandwidth throttling too. \n\nRubbernet provides a breakdown of per-app network usage, so you can quickly detect apps that phone home, connect to certain servers without your knowledge, or blame the app that's slowing down your network.\n\n\nA: Have a look at vnstat:\n\nvnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor for Linux and BSD that keeps a log of network traffic for the selected interface(s). It uses the network interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source. This means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures light use of system resources. However, in Linux at least a 2.2 series kernel is required\n\nIt also works on BSD and Mac OSX.\n", "Q: VPN on OS X Lion Server I'm trying to configure VPN on my Mac Mini Server running OS X Lion 10.7.1 with Server app.\nI have a SKY D-Link ADSL router connected via ethernet is Apple AirPort Extreme and my other devices including my Mini connect to my AirPort Extreme via Wi-Fi.\nI don't have a Static IP so I am using DynDNS. I have installed the DynDNS Mac application on my Mini.\nI have set the hostname on my mini to the hostname provided by DynDNS and I have set my Mini a static LAN IP of 192.168.0.100.\nI have turned the VPN service on the Mini's server app, set a secret key and set a range for VPN connections of 192.168.0.101 - 192.168.0.200\nFor testing purposes I have enabled and forwarded all ports for incoming services to 192.168.0.100 on my D-Link Sky router.\nI have tried to connect my iPhone using my DynDNS host name authenticating with a network account I have created and my secret key. I get an error the L2TP-VPN server did not respond.\nMy internet connection is working correctly on both my network and my iPhones data plan I have checked with my ISP and they do not block VPN connections.\n\nA: I was getting the same error. In my case it turned out to be a conflict with \"Back to My Mac\"—specifically within my Airport Extreme. Once I removed my iCloud user account from the Airport Extreme, OS X Server's VPN started responding.\nIf there are any Airport Extreme/Express devices on your network, definitely remove any iCloud/MobileMe accounts using Airport Utility.\nYou may also have Back to My Mac turned on in System Preferences—and it's conceivable that could cause a problem as well...\nI recommend (at least temporarily) checking that no user accounts have Back to My Mac enabled in the iCloud pane of System Preferences; I would verify this on every user account on every Mac on your network.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I suspect that the problem is that your router is not forwarding the traffic to the server.  You said you've forwarded all ports to the server, but that only applies to the TCP and UDP protocols; both VPN protocols Lion Server supports use TCP and UDP to negotiate the connection, but then switch to an alternate IP protocol (with no associated port number) for transferring the actual data.  If you use the L2TP/IPSec type of VPN connection, it needs the ESP/IP protocol forwarded at the router; if you use PPTP, it needs GRE/IP forwarded.\nIf the router cannot be made to forward these protocols, you will not be able to access the VPN server from the outside.  The D-Link router I have here (undoubtedly a different model, but still...) has options in Advanced -> Virtual Server to forward \"IPSec\" (which should include ESP, but I haven't tested it) and/or PPTP (which should include GRE).  It also has an option in Adcanced -> Firewall Settings to enable the server as a DMZ host, which should forward almost everything to it.  You may have to do a bit of experimentation to see what (if anything) works.\nBTW, just to complicate things, both VPN protocols may be blocked by client-side routers that don't know how to cope with ESP and/or GRE. This makes testing difficult, since if you fail to connect you don't necessarily know if the problem is on the server or client side...  If you have a way to try connecting from just outside the router, so you know there's nothing in the way on the client's end, you'll have a much better idea what's going on.\n\nA: I'm having a similar issue, but I suppose the problem is with my ISP, who filters arbitrarily undesired traffic.\nThe first thing I would suggest is using an IP range less common than 192.168.0.x in your LAN, because usually a VPN connects two networks having different IP classes. The IP class you are using is too common, and in many cases the remote LAN from which you're trying to connect to your VPN uses the same class (see TA25227 for private network classes).\nIn addition, upgrade to Lion v. 10.7.2 and explicitly assign access rights to VPN service to all the users that will be allowed to log in (using Server Admin).\n", "Q: Record / playback keystrokes There are 3rd party apps but I'm not interested in those.  I'm a web developer and during testing I find myself entering login credentials over and over again.  If I could quickly \"play\" these keystorkes it would help my sanity.  I'm assuming Automator can do this?  I've never used Automater so a complete answer for that would be appreciated.  However I would prefer something even more native if it's possible.\n\nA: Let me start by saying that there are lots of good third party apps for automatically logging in to web forms. I highly recommend using one of those.\nTo answer your question: Yes, you can do this with a combination of Automator and AppleScript. Here's how.\nOpen Automator. Go to File-> New. Select Service.\nType applescript into the search bar near the top left.\nDrag the Run AppleScript item to the area on the right.\nReplace the purple code that starts in the box with this:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"username\"\n    keystroke tab\n    keystroke \"password\"\nend tell\n\nNow replace the username text with your username, and replace the password text with your password.\nThis will have the computer type your username, hit tab, and type your password.\nNow, at the top of the Automator window, set Service receives to no input and in to the app you need this to happen in.\nAutomator shoud now look like this:\n\nSave this and give it a name. Now, go to the app you selected at the top right and put your cursor in the username field.\nGo to the app's menu (next to the Apple menu) and choose Services-> {what you named your Automator app}.\nIt should run the Automator workflow and 'play back' the keystrokes.\nAgain, this is the hard, insecure way. I highly recommend apps like 1Password and LastPass.\n\nA: Well, if you just want to input a username and a password automatically, simply go to Safari > Preferences > Autofill and select \"User Names and Passwords\". In theory that should ask you upon submiting the form if you want Safari to remember it, and if you select yes, it will store it in your Keychain.\nNext time you visit the website you will just have to type the first character and Safari will automatically fill in the rest for you.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: OS X Lion Migration - Problem with spaces configuration Have any of you faced some problems with the new Lion Mission Control after migrating from Snow Leopard.\nI have the following two problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Finder window is generally hidden. When it is hidden, I have to context-click the Finder dock icon and select option -> This desktop.\n\n*Using quicksilver to switch apps, generally the apps will be hidden behind another app. For instance, switching from an alternate application to Firefox I will be shown Finder (with Firefox completely hidden behind it).\nNOTE: The issue of Item 2 is when using full screen mode, a new feature in Lion, and could be the source of the issues. \nAs a last resort, I will be performing a new clean install.  Does anyone have suggestion as to how I may fix these issues without having to perform a clean install?\n\nA: As far as my understanding of your question goes,\n\nThe Finder window, is almost always is hidden. I have to context-click the Finder dock icon and select option -> This desktop.\n\nWell, why would you expect it to always be visible?  \nWhen I click Finder in the Dock, it either shows an existing window or creates a new one on the last space I've used it on and switches me to that space. Here, Finder is no different from any other application.\nOne thing you may want to do is to set the setting you mentioned to All Desktops so the window is displayed on each space. By doing so, you'll be able to skip the screen-switching hustle when you're working on several desktops and need a Finder window here.\nChoosing This Desktop setting binds new windows to open on the specified desktop so I fail to see how it helps you.\n\nMost of the time, the apps will be hidden behind another app. For instance if I am switching to Firefox. I will be shown Finder (with firefox completely hidden behind it).\n\nI am not sure what you're talking about because I'm not a Quicksilver user but let me give you a couple of suggestions.\nFirstly, if any app is in Lion fullscreen mode, there is no way to put something “below” it—in fact, it contradicts the very idea of fullscreen mode.\nSecondly, why don't you just use Dock and Mission Control together to switch between apps? \nSwipe four (or three, depends on you Trackpad settings) fingers up to get a view of current screen, then just swipe left and right with three fingers to switch between desktops and fullscreen apps.\nLast, I doubt this has anything to do with a clean install—rather, you seem to have some misunderstanding about how Dock and/or Mission Control work, and probably the program you're using (Quicksilver) may have issues with Lion (which I can't confirm or disconfirm). If you still have issues, please indicate your exact steps, expected and actual outcome so we can understand the problem.\n", "Q: Custom Finder \"go to\" shortcuts I am struggling with the new Lion finder features. There are some subtle differences that are putting me off.\nI used to have custom \"go to\" shortcuts in Snow Leopard. For example, I used to have a folder called \"Tools,\" and I had assigned a custom keyboard shortcut from the preference panel. Now I am not able to find those options. \nDoes Mac OS X Lions still have those options? If it does have them, where can I find them?\n\nA: As long as the folder appears under the \"recent\" sub-menu, it will respond to a custom shortcut.\n\n\nA: Default Folder X will do this and a lot more. Highly recommended.\n(Aside: It was also part of one of the recent Mac Software bundles, so if you bought one of those, you may already own it. Otherwise the price may seem steep, but once you realize how handy it is, it's worth it. There's a 30 day trial.)\n", "Q: Does an iOS app have the ability to set iOS Safari cookies? My specific interest is in the context of the Facebook for iOS app, but it can be asked of an iOS app really.\nGiven all the recent changes to Facebook and the way that Facebook cookies are not cleared when you log out of Facebook I've become keenly interested in knowing how my access patterns to Facebook can result in tracking cookies sticking to me.\nWhat I'd like to know is: if I use an iOS application, like the Facebook for iOS application, can I end up with session cookies set in iOS Safari that relate to Facebook? Or are all login cookies related to Facebook completely contained to just the Facebook application?\n\nA: The iOS security sandbox prevents App store apps from writing to the Safari app's data directories, including wherever Safari writes cookies.\n", "Q: Is there a built-in text-to-graphic utility for OS X Lion? I believe I've seen one or more utilities, possibly command-line or Applescript, which will take a string and create, for example, an image containing that text with the specified font size, etc.\nI can't find it again. Does anyone have a hint?\n\nA: ImageMagick doesn't come with OS X, but it should though.\nconvert -background skyblue -border 10 -bordercolor skyblue -fill 'hsb(10%,50%,50%)' -font /Library/Fonts/Arial\\ Narrow.ttf -pointsize 24 label:\"some text\" output.png\nIf you have to specify some more complex styles, using webkit2png might be easier.\necho \"<style>em {padding:5px}</style><em>Test</em>\" > test.html\nwebkit2png test.html --clipwidth=55 --clipheight=35 --scale 1 -C\n\n\nA: Image Magick will do what you want, I believe. It's not built-in.\n", "Q: Root password stopped working I used to be able to enable “root” user and log in under it.\n(I know this is not recommended but let's just assume there is an actual reason for doing so.)\nI just repeated the instructions, set another root password and logged out of my account.\nHowever, logging in with root user and the password I typed doesn't seem to work.\nThe login screen just shakes as if the password is incorrect.\nI already tried setting it to a different one, then to an empty string—nothing works.\nWhat do I do now?\n\nA: Assuming you have followed these instructions and still can't get it to let you in as root, I would recommend trying out the instructions in this support discussion to get it working.\n", "Q: Offline files / Directory sync I have a MacBook Pro that I travel with a lot.  I also have a NAS for my home network.  Many timesI use my MacBook in areas where I do not have Internet access.  I'd like to have copies of some of my folders while I travel and sync up when I return back home.  Is there anything like the Microsoft 'Offline Files' feature present in the MacOS, or do I need to script something like this myself?\n\nA: I use chronosync to sync my laptop back to my iMac and NAS. It's not a free solution, but once its setup it works. There are other options available from a simple rsync script to other sync tools. \n\nA: SpiderOak's sync feature actually works very well. It also encrypt's everything on your machine, so plain data never gets transmitted. I use this for important files I like to keep sync'ed. I do agree though, that Dropbox works very well. I have also been a ChronoSync user for a couple of years, and it's sync features are great as well. \n\nA: If you roll your own (I did), I would strongly suggest you use Unison.  I have a couple of launchd jobs that watch key directories (~/Documents, ~/.dotfiles).\n", "Q: External HDD Unmounted After Sleep I have the new iMac 21,5\" and a Samsung G3 Station 1,5TB external HDD. When I plug my HDD, connecting to energy and via USB, no problems, Mac OS recognizes it and I can use it normally. The problem appears when I put my computer to sleep. When it wakes up, my HDD was unmounted and to use it again I have to remove USB cable and reinsert it. \nThis is annoying me. I have looking for suggestions or improvements to put it work better, but no idea.\nIf you have any ideas, please let me know.\nAdditional Information: \n\n\n*\n\n*Snow Leopard 10.6.8;\n\n*On restart it works;\n\n*Disk utility cannot see HDD after it wakes up;\n\n*My HDD is formatted on NTFS. I don't know exactly, but it could be part of the issue. Unfortunatelly I can't format it to HFS+ or FAT32. My files and backup are all there. \n\n\nA: If only we've searched before buying we would find this drive has this problems. It seems it lies either in firmware of enclosure or in firmware of a disk used inside. I didn't find FW updates for it on Samsung support site (but they have a habit to hide such stuff).\nProbably, you may upgrade FW for the disk used inside enclosure and it could help but no guarantee.\nIf you can get your money back just do it because it seems this product is faulty (it probably behaves the same under Windows (you may try it if you could)).\nIf you can't get your money back or exchange it try this solution from MacOSXHints.\n", "Q: How do you test network speed without an app? The usual Internet speed test is written in Flash. Is there an HTML one that works with iPad and iPhone?\n\nA: SpeedTest.net has an iPad/iPhone/iPod app.\n\nA: Try http://speedof.me\nIt use html5 and works without flash.\nYou can also see your bandwidth graph which is interesting.\n\nA: ISPGeeks.com has a non-flash java based bandwidth tester. It pretty accurately measured the speed of my iPad on my home connection, as compared to similar tests on the usual Flash-based sites.\n\nA: dslreports.com is my go-to resource for carrier/network info and diagnostics. Free membership, no spam, genuine user generated content, reviews, and support all are part.  The \"tools\" section is very robust.\n", "Q: Is password to make purchase from App store on iPad and iPhone encrypted? Is it safe to purchase apps when connected to an unsecured Wifi network (like Starbucks)? Can your password be seen?\n\nA: According to Apple, \"The iTunes Store and Mac App Store uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all functions that require personal information.\"\nSo passwords are sent encrypted, not in cleartext. If the NSA is packet sniffing at your local Starbucks, chances are they know how to get your password (but if they're looking for your App store password, you've got bigger problems), but it should be reasonably safe.\n\nA: Yes, the App Store's use SSL, there is no way they'd be allowed to take credit cards without using SSL.\n\nA: You should probably be more concerned about the risks from \"shoulder surfers\" and/or a weak guessable iTunes password, than packet sniffing of SSL traffic.\n", "Q: Creating a wifi hotspot on OSX with a connected USB wifi adapter instead of airport (OSX Lion) I am using a USB wifi adapter on my Lion imac.  I am trying to use that connection to create a working wifi hot spot with the imac's internal airport. \nI tried following these instructions:\nhttp://maketecheasier.com/create-wifi-hotspot-using-mac-os-x/2009/10/20\nIt didn't work, though. It feels like i need to do one more step to get the connection bridged between the usb adapter and the airport. \nThanks,\nzeem\n\nA: I think this will only work on wifi adaptors that support bridged mode wireless. Not all of them do. The internal Airport does which is why it can be turned into a hotspot. \nI think you'll be able to go this way\nShare your connection from : [usb wifi adaptor] \nTo Computers using : [airport] \n\nSetting up all security features as per normal. \n", "Q: If I buy an app from the app store, do I have to stay logged into the app store? This question says that you can install the same purchase of Lion on multiple non-commercial Apple machines.\nThe accepted answer states the same applies to all App Store purchases.\nMy question however is, once you install something from the app store onto a 2nd machine, do you have to remain logged into the app store.\nFor example. My girlfriend just got given a mac with Snow Leopard. I want to log into the app store on her machine, install Lion, but then log out, and leave the app store logged into her Apple account.\nIs that ok?\n\nA: Yes, although there are many questions that cover the same ground already on SE.\nYou can DL app store apps (including Lion) on your girlfriend's computer. Then she can log into her own apple account and buy other apps. The only thing you need to be aware of is that for updates, you can only update the apps you bought with that particular account. So if you want to update Lion (not likely as it will come through software update) or other apps, you will have to re-log into your account.\nI believe most apps have a 5 computer limit.\n", "Q: FaceTime Failed: Person Not Available Consider an iPad 2 using WiFi attepting to make FaceTime calls to users on an iPhone 4. Each contact has their phone number defined under the iPhone tag (as opposed to Mobile). \nWhenever attempting a FaceTime connection, FaceTime attempts to connect, and fails with the error:\n\nFaceTime failed - 'Person' is not available for FaceTime.\n\nMeasures attempted:\n\n\n*\n\n*close FaceTime from running apps.\n\n*disable & re-enable FaceTime from Settings.\n\n*confirmed the device's WiFi is active & enabled.\n\n\nI've seen the 'solution' of \"reset all settings\", but suspect that's overkill, and likely won't work, as reported by lots of other users.\nHow can this error be avoided?\n\nA: According to Apple, some of the symptoms are:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you are calling someone on FaceTime, the number on their screen\nis not your number.\n\n*People are unable to initiate a FaceTime call\nwith you. \n\n*After installing a new carrier settings update, FaceTime\ndoes not activate.\n\n\nHow to fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Settings > Phone, turn FaceTime OFF and turn it back ON again\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset all settings\n\n*Done\n\n\nA: Also be sure that BOTH devices are on wifi, not just the iPad.\n", "Q: What is the best way to move Microsoft Office 2011 to a new Mac? I've purchased Microsoft Office for Mac Home & Office 2011 (single computer), and have installed and activated on my current Mac.\nGiven that I've already activated the software for my current Mac, what steps should I do to move the app to the new Mac, without having any problems re-activating the software? Would Apple's Migration Assistant automate the process completely?\n\nA: There are no special steps. Install it using the installer just like you did on your old Mac. When prompted for the activation key, select \"activate by phone\" and input nothing, keep trying and it should provide a number to call.\nMicrosoft (unlike Adobe) does not have an automated system for licence deactivation. This has been a point of great angst among Mac users as it requires them to call Microsoft each and every time they move the Office application from one machine to another.\nI believe the number in the US is: +1 (800) 936-5700. Your product support number may vary.\nHere is a rundown on activation and product key information.\n\nA: This worked for me: After an incomplete timemachine backup (I excluded the folder /System/Library) I had to do the following to get it working again on the same machine (I guess it should also work on your second Mac). \nBeside the App that was installed to /Applications/Microsoft\\ Office\\ 2011 Restore these files from your previous installation:\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.microsoft.office.licensing.helper.plist\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.microsoft.office.licensing.helper\n/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist\n\nSource: this guide\n\nA: The previous answer is missing one path/folder.

It's a 128GB SSD drive, but the system is using 52.6GB of this for it's swap files, which regularly results in zero space remaining on the drive and the system locking up. \n\nAny idea why it would be using so much space for this (please see the visualisation screenshot, above)?\n\nA: The Original Poster explained that the answer was as follows:\nI killed Sequel Pro that was using 2GB of RAM, and then ran:\n$ sudo periodic daily weekly monthly\nThis had the effect (correct if wrong) of running some tasks which cleaned up the swap files. I now have between 30GB and 50GB space remaining (it's fluctuating..)\n", "Q: AirDrop: How to access AirDrop from command line? I was looking for an option to use Airdrop to sync a set of directories between two computers.\nI want to achieve this wirelessly (hence chose Airdrop without having the computers connect on a network or with cross cable wires). \nIs there a command to send files to another Mac? \nAlso, is there a way to allow a Mac to automatically receive the requests? \n\nA: There is now an opensource implementation for AirDrop (with some limitations)\nSee https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop\n\nA: If both computers have Wi-Fi capability built-in (otherwise AirDrop won't work either), you can setup a WLAN between them directly (no additional hardware required). The procedure is extremely simple (more or less copied verbatim from Apple):\n\n*\n\n*Choose Create Network from the AirPort status icon in the menu bar.\nIf the icon isn’t in the menu bar, choose Apple > System Preferences, and then click Network. Click AirPort and select the “Show AirPort status in menu bar” checkbox.\n\n\n*Give the network a name and select a channel from the pop-up menu (or just use the default channel).\n\n\n*Select the Require Password checkbox to protect your network with a password. Type the password users will need to enter in order to join your network. Unfortunately WPA/WPA2 is not supported so pick WEP128 and type a password of exactly 13 ASCII characters or 26 hex digits\nFrom the other computer you now can access the network under the name assigned in step 2. To exchange files, either use the Public/Drop Box folders of the individual users or share a specific folder for everybody.\n\nA: AirDrop is a single purpose function.  It is for transfer of files.  It is a pipeline only, open or not.  I believe any manipulation of those files must be done at either the origin or the destination.  I believe only an object can go through the pipeline, and not an action.\nYou seem to want a synching action\nI think this is the concept of AirDrop.\n", "Q: Search through terminal history with up and down keys in OS X Lion After I upgraded to OS X I am not able to use my ~/.inputrc bindings to search through the shell command history:\n# these allow you to start typing a command and\n# use the up/down arrow to auto complete from\n# commands in your history\n\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward\n\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward\n\nAny idea what I have to change or do? Are there any default keys for that I could use?\n\nA: The up/down history scrolling in Terminal only works in bash, not sh. Try typing bash in Terminal, and see whether the arrow keys work. If this is the case, you can go to preferences and set your default login shell to /bin/bash.\n\nA: For those who are looking for Page Up/ Page Down key instead of up/down arrow. Use the below settings.\n# Page Up/Down\n\"\\e[5~\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[6~\": history-search-forward\n\nTested with iterm and bash version 3.2\n\nA: For searching your history, you can also use a nifty feature of the bash shell.\nThis maybe a little off topic, but in bash shell you can use CTRL-R to search backwards in your shell history.\nExample - search for ssh connections in your history:\ntatooine-2257:~ mallert$\n(reverse-i-search)`ssh': ssh mallert@localhost\n\nAnd when I hit CTRL-R again, bash does a search within the former search results:\ntatooine-2257:~ mallert$\n(reverse-i-search)`ssh': ssh localhost\n\nAnd you can hit CTRL-R again and again. You can also work with regular expressions.\n", "Q: Cannot trash a file? I want to delete a file because it's of no use to me yet I seem unable to do so. I've gone through these steps so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put file in trash, empty trash. -> Mac keeps on telling me: 12 items to remove..\n\n*rm -rf /.Trash/* -> process seems to go on indefinitely\n\n*sudo rm -R path/to/file -> same as above\n\n\nI'm desperate.. what should I do?\n\nA: If you've put the file in your own Trash, you got the path wrong in step 2:\nrm -rf ~/.Trash/*\n\nor (because there might be something wrong with the file permissions)\nsudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/*\n\n\nA: If the file is on a partition other than the startup volume, it will not be in ~/.Trash/, rather it will be in /Volumes/volumeName/.Trashes/userID/, where volumeName is the name of the partition and userID is your user's numerical user ID (probably 501 if you only have one user).\nTo be certain you have the correct path to the file, I would recommend using Terminal's drag and drop feature. This also helps to avoid accidentally deleting files with the potentially dangerous sudo rm -Rf command.\nWithout pressing return at the end, type sudo rm -Rf with a trailing space at the end, \nsudo rm -Rf <--leave a space after -Rf, do not press return yet\n\nthen drag the file you want to delete from the Finder into the Terminal window. Then press return.\nIf it still won't delete, you should probably verify the disk with Disk Utility.\n\nA: Did you try this :\nsudo rm -Rf ~/.Trash/*\n\nThen, type your admin password to confirm\n\nA: Well, this isn't as convenient as deleting the files without logging out, but this is virtually guaranteed to work (it's never failed for me): Use Finder to move it to the Trash. Then reboot, then empty the Trash.\n", "Q: How do I restore my .bash_profile? I've accidentally overwritten my ~/.bash_profile file.  \nDoes anyone have a \"sample\" one I could copy, or know where I might be able to find one?\n\nA: Search for dot_files in Google or Github if you like a sample one. \nIf you like to restore it, you could try to get it from your TimeMachine backup (if present)\n\nA: There is a backup located at:\n/etc/skel/.bash_profile\n\nJust copy it over your current file.\n\nA: This solution only works if you have a terminal open that have the old .bash_profile loaded in it.\n\n*\n\n*Recover the aliases:\nRun this in terminal alias to print out all aliases and manually paste them to .bash_profile\n\n\n*Recover the PATH: Print PATH using echo $PATH. Manually paste it to the bash_profile in this format:\nexport PATH=\"my_old_paths_string_that_echoed_in_this_step:$PATH\"\n\n\n\n*Recover the functions: Print functions using declare -F | grep -v 'declare -f _'. This will print the bash functions that don't start with _, which are usually the ones you define in the bash_profile. If you remember that you defined some functions starting with _, then you can remove the grep. Okay. This will give you the names of all the functions. For each function, do this:\n\ndeclare -f my_precious_function1\n\nThis should give you the definition of the function. And then you copy paste it to .bash_profile. Doing this manually will allow you to skip copying some functions like deactivate etc that were not defined in .bash_profile.\n\n\n*Recover the exports: export -p is the command to list all exports in current session. Run it in new terminal and safe terminal and use python's set difference to list exports missing in the new terminal. Once you have the list, replace declare -x with export and copy pasta.\n\nThat's all I put in bash_profile, alias,functions and PATH. If you have more stuff you can recover it manually by finding your way around. Hope this helps.\nBefore closing your safe terminal, make sure that your things are working in a new terminal, maybe try the declare -F command in the new terminal or some other aliases. I'm not gonna close my safe terminal for days.\n\nA: You can try to recover it using TestDisk.\nIf that doesn't work, type:\nx56~:$ alias >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nand \nx56:~$ echo \"PATH=$PATH\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nto at least recover your PATH and aliases, which you can paste in your new profile file.\n\nA: If your terminal window is still open, you can save the current environment settings to rebuild.  The recovered file will contain more information than you may have defined yourself, so remove the parts you don't need:\nDefined vars and functions:\n$ declare > .bash_profile.recovered\n\nAliases:\n$ alias >> .bash_profile.recovered\n\n\nA: Unfortunately this is what revision control is for. There is no way to undo modifications, while deletes through finder are actually moves to the trash.\nUse TimeMachine in the future. Aside from this, it will also give you piece of mind when your current hard drive dies. I know people facing this problem now and if they only invested $30-$50 into a backup hdd, the problems would not happen. I recommend you just learn from this and back up using timemachine periodically.\nGithub as mentioned by Ian C is a great place to back your dotfiles, also you can find dotfiles from others'. Version control to the rescue here, don't know how many times it saved me, but definitely more than I can remember. The advantage of TimeMachine is that it also does version control, problem is that its stored by snapshot time, not logical version.\nGood luck.\n\nA: If you can't use Terminal to access your ~/.bash_profile (e.g. it's corrupted) you can use BBEdit or any other GUI editor that can open files from a location and open your corrupted file in order to fix it.\nBTW. if you know the location and name of any hidden file, this method can be used to open it (assuming it is a text based file).\n\nA: This method works only if you saved the bash_profile file to a point where you want to go back in TextEdit, doesn't work if edited using vi or nano (thanks to @nohillside for pointing this out). You can open the file using TextEdit (for ex: open ~/.bash_profile) and click on File -> Revert To -> Browse All Versions... and then select the version you want to revert back to.\n\n\nA: I found this website that has two example of the files of bash_profile and bashrc.\nhttps://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html\n", "Q: How can i burn a Windows 7 USB to an ISO?

I al\nNote: I'm using Lion, btw.\nCheers!\n\nA: The easiest way will probably be UNetbootin which lets you specify an ISO to use and will create a bootable USB drive from it. I've not tried it on Lion but a quick Google says it should be compatible (a 90% of the time it works all the time situation).\n", "Q: How can I create a Mac boot disk? I ran a disk check on my hard disk and the Disk Utility tells me \"Error: This disk needs to be repaired. Start up your computer with another disk (such as your Mac OS X installation disc), and then use Disk Utility to repair this disk.\".\nThe last physical disk I had was the Leopard -> Snow Leopard upgrade and I now do not know where that disk is.\nIs there a way that I can create a bootable CD, DVD or flash drive, boot the computer from that and repair the hard disk?\nI have Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\n\nA: To boot the computer, you need an already-formatted disk, which could be a DVD, a USB drive, or another hard drive.\nIf you do not already have one of these (and do not have another Mac that you can use) then your options are fairly limited:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy Snow Leopard on DVD. You can get it from Apple for $30, free shipping, but it won't ship for 3-5 days.\n\n*Buy DiskWarrior [$100] which is probably your best bet if you want to try to save the current hard drive.\n\n*Buy Lion on a USB drive $70 from Apple. Note that this is a terrible solution, IMO, because you will not be able to download Lion from the Mac App Store nor will you be able to use Lion's \"Recovery Partition\" (which, if you had it on your Mac, would most likely have solved your problem).\nThe rest of this answer is strictly opinion.\nPersonally I think your best option is #2 and #1.\nDiskWarrior is an essential tool for trying to recover from hard drive errors. If your drive is having problems, I would not trust it for very long. Copy an essential files to another drive and then run DiskWarrior. Even if DiskWarrior is able to correct its errors, I would be sure to start making regular backups using either SuperDuper or CarbonCopyCloner.\nThe problem is that if DiskWarrior finds problems that cannot be fixed, then you are going to need to replace the hard drive and reinstall Mac OS X… which means that you are going to have to buy Snow Leopard on DVD (assuming that you don't have a friend who can make or loan you a copy).\nThe $70 USB stick from Apple is a terrible deal. If you want to move to Lion, buy your own USB drive, find a friend with a Mac, ask them if you can use it to buy Lion from the Mac App Store, and make your own Lion USB drive using one of the many how-tos posted online, such as this one from TUAW.com.\n", "Q: Remove desktop folder which is on the desktop and contains everything on the desktop I don't how this happend, but I feel like my machine is experiencing a Being John Malkovich syndrome.\nThere is a folder on my Desktop called Desktop which contains all the other folders on my Desktop.

If so, you can just delete the symlink.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse & Bluetooth Keyboard Won't Pair in Lion I have a new macbook pro 15 inch 2011 model. My magic mouse and bt keyboard won't pair. The keyboard doesn't even get detected in the bluetooth settings. How can I get them to work together?\nI have bluetooth enabled and tried using Setup Bluetooth Device to pair them.\n\nA: I don't think this is your problem, but it might be and doesn't seem to have been raised elsewhere.  I bought a new MacBook Pro running Lion a few months ago, and found that the (also new) Magic Mouse would not connect automatically—I had to force it to connect after any disconnection from switching off the MM or from rebooting the MacBook.\nOne of the genii at the Genius Bar, after ½ hour of experimenting and in the process of telling me that Lion would have to be reloaded, suddenly realized that the MM connected upon being clicked.  He stated that he had not run into this before and that it must be a new feature in Lion related to battery preservation.\nBottom line, try a single mouse click to initiate the Bluetooth connection.\n\nA: I have what is probably the same problem, each time my MBP wakes up the blued daemon crashes (can be seen in Console). AFAIK it has been reported to Apple so I'm waiting for them to fix it. In the mean time I restart the blued daemon each time I notice this problem. The easiest way to do this is by turning bluetooth off and on again via the bluetooth icon.\n", "Q: How can I reformat my hard-drive? I am in Disk Utility under the Erase Tab. The Format section is grayed out even though I have my main disk selected. The only buttons active are Erase Free Space, but I want to reformat the entire disk.\n\nA: You cannot reformat the startup drive from which you booted (and from which the system is currently running). You would need to boot from a different volume, whether a different partition, or from a DVD.\n\nA: If your goal is to completely wipe all data which is on your current boot disk, then follow the procedure below.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the Mac OS X CD.\n\n*Restart the computer.\n\n*Immediately after the startup sound, press and hold the \"C\" key to start up from CD. \n\n*When the Installer screen appears, do not click Continue. Instead, choose Installer > Open Disk Utilities. \n\n*Select the hard drive to erase. \n\n*Click the Erase tab. \n\n*Select the volume format from the Volume Format pop-up menu. \n\n*Click Options. \n\n*Select the checkbox for \"Zero out data\".

I'm sorry. It's a great idea though, and I would totally love it if someone proved me wrong and posted an app capable of doing this, for I too have a pretty messy downloads folder. \nThe only way I found to get easily the item count is the status bar. Perhaps though, you could do a workflow in Automator or Apple Script Editor. I know Automator can make folder actions, which are run every time a file is added to a folder. It would just be a matter of keeping a count, I guess. \n\nSources: A bit of research on desktop badges in Apple's developer documentation.

When I stream audio from my iPhone 4 into my Ford Sync audio system over bluetooth, the audio quality is excellent. However, if I plug in a USB cable to get access to the hands-free features, then the audio quality degrades almost immediately. Sound comes out with \"hissing\" sounds, pops and cracks. This is even more noticeable when listening to spoken word or podcasts. \nI have tried different USB cables and have verified that the same audio files do not play with the same defects thru the iPhone's speakers when using headphones. Also, the same files played over my Mac sound just fine. Any pointers would be appreciated. If you are experiencing this same problem with your Ford Sync system, please add a comment to know that at least I am not the only one experiencing this issue. Thanks.\n\nA: I read a post about this before on the apple discussions board.  The upshot of it is there doesn't seem to be a permanent fix.  However, people have provided several workarounds of which some work for some people but none seem to work for everyone.  Here's a few things to try.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Leave iPhone in Airplane mode while connected  \n\n*Turn off WiFi on the iPhone\n\n*Turn off 3G on the iPhone\n\n*Connect the cable while the device and stereo are off, then turn both on\n\n*Rebooting the iPhone  \n\n\nI can't say from personal experience whether any of these actually work but anecdotal evidence from peoples experience in the thread linked to above would suggest they may.  I think it may be a hardware design issue that is probably due to interference from the USB cable when it's connected but many people on that thread say that it only started when they updated their iPhone 4 to iOS 4.1.  If you're on that version you could try updating to the latest version of the iOS software.  You could also wait until Apple release iOS 5 which is likely to be October 4th 2011 as they may have fixed it.\n\nA: I found a solution. \nWhen you connect to your car using USB it sends the music files to your car stereo and the car system processing them. It's not like AUX connection when the sound just goes to your stereo and plays through the speakers. \nIf you changed the options for individual tracks in your iTunes library, the car stereo receives the files with different settings such as \"volume adjustments\" and \"equalizers\". This causes your stereo to process all the files incorrectly and messes up the sound quality, corrupts the bass, and creates cracks or hiss when it plays. \nGo to your iTunes library, list all your tracks and highlight them all by pressing \"Command+A\" on Mac or \"Ctrl+A\" on PC. Then right click and select \"Get Info\". In the pop-up go to Options and adjust the volume to \"none\". Then, in the \"equalizer\", pick \"None\". It will bring all the songs to the original settings but your car stereo won't have any problems when you connect through USB. The sound becomes clear and even better than AUX connection. \nEnjoy! \n\nA: Those symptoms sound like the result of over-amplification of the audio signal. I get the same result on my iPhone 4 when I have my car audio turned up, but the iPhone's internal volume not maxed. If I reverse that and max the internal volume (turning the car audio volume down to compensate), the amount of cracking/popping/hissing goes down substantially.\nMy experience is with using the headphone jack, though, not USB. I'm not sure if you would see the same effect there.\n", "Q: Mouse pointer intermittently jumps to corner of screen I recently got two new Macs, an iMac (with magic trackpad) and a MacbookAir (both the most recent models - mid 2011 and both with Lion). They are both suffering from the same issue so I don't think it's hardware based.\nBasically approximately every 10 or 15 minutes I'll be trying to move the mouse pointer or click and suddenly the pointer will jump to the corner of the screen (normally the bottom left but sometimes the top right). It might do it three or four times in a row and then not for half an hour.\nI wondered if it was some sort of gesture I was accidentally performing (maybe more than one finger is touching the trackpad as I click?) but I don't seem to be able to reproduce it on purpose. It doesn't seem to be tied to one particular app but happens whatever I'm using.\nThe only mentions of a similar problem I could find online talked about hot corners and I've made sure all hot corners are disabled in system preferences. \nHas anyone else run into this? It's driving me absolutely crazy (because when I click in the bottom corner the active app loses focus and I lose my flow!).\nEdit: to add further information which may help.\nI started to suspect that it might be something to do with applications that I have running all of the time. So I started trying to change things (as much as I can while still being able to work). The first potential culprit was Terminal running in fullscreen mode. So I took it out of fullscreen mode. And for a while it seemed to fix the problem. But unfortunately it is still happening but it appears to be less frequent!\nI don't have anything else running fullscreen and I also don't have Dashboard running in a space (the problem still happened when it was).\nOther apps that I am prettymuch always running:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alfred (launcher)\n\n*PhpStorm (IDE)\n\n*Firefox\n\n\nDoes that help at all?\nEdit: Another update.\nAt the suggestion of @mspasov I checked the logs in Console.app just after it happened. Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be anything that shows up in the logs at the point when the jump happens. I warnings like this:\nosascript: Error loading /Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Unit Types:  dlopen(/Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Unit Types, 262): no suitable image found.  Did find:\n    /Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Unit Types: no matching architecture in universal wrapper\n\nBut that is happening frequently and happens lots of times when the jump doesn't.\nTrying to think of software which could be causing the problem it suddenly occurred to me that Growl is also constantly running on both machines which display the problem. However, disabling Growl hasn't stopped the problem from happening...\n\nA: The mouse problem you are suffering from has to do with OS X polling rates. It has been a known issue for quite some time now. You can read about the issue and a general rundown of some of the mice affected.\nNote that contrary to what the author states, the problem still very much exists in OS X Lion. Refer to this post for your specific problem, which identifies CPU cycles as a possible culprit.\nAs a designer, I found this insufferable. I purchased and tested (even Apple's Magic Mouse) numerous mice only to have them returned to the store. Each mouse worked flawlessly under Windows 7 I might add. I ended up buying a Razor DeathAdder (Black Edition) with ample DPI and polling rate (even though I don't game). It still jumps every know and again when the CPU is busy (I'm running a more than capable Mac mini 2.3 GHz i5 with 8 GB of RAM and an OCZ Vertex2 SSD) but the jumps are so extremely infrequent that they are now a rarity rather than the norm. I should note that this problem occurs using the native OS mouse drivers, the Razor factory driver, or SteerMouse.\nSadly, there is truly no solution, just workarounds (mine was to buy a mouse with industry leading polling rates and DPI.\nThe simply truth is there is a flaw in OS X and how it handles mice that needs to be fixed. And Lion has not corrected the issue.\n\nA: If your preferences are corrupt, you could delete anything in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch* and log out and then in again to start with new MultiTouch settings to see if that fixes things.\n", "Q: Deleted apps on my iPhone stays in iTunes When I delete an app inside iTunes from the iTunes Library, it will also get deleted from my iPhone, the next time I sync. The same with if I download a new app, it will be transfered to the iPhone.\nWhen I install an app on my iPhone it will also be imported to the iTune library, however when I delete an app on my iPhone, it doesn't get deleted from iTunes automatically?\nWhy? And how can I change this?\n\nA: Allow me to answer this by providing a counter-example.\nI own two iOS devices; An iPhone 4 and an iPad (original). I use slightly different application sets on them. For example I don't have a notification app called Prowl on my iPad because it's intended use is to get my attention anywhere I am. And the iPhone is always by my side or at least in very close proximity.\nAnd of course, there are iPad only apps such as the iWork series until recently. Even then, I only have the iWork apps on my iPad because working on something like that on an iPhone is admittedly kind of terrible.\nSo, when managing my apps, if deleting an app on device deleted it in iTunes, the other device would lose the app on next sync. This is not a good thing for me.\nWhen you delete an app in iTunes, it unchecks it from the sync list. This way you continue to receive updates for it via iTunes, and if you ever want the app back, it's a simple operation to check the box.\nI do believe @Hand-E-Food's example of a paid app is a good example. While we know that you can re-download any app not in your library you already paid for, not having to jump through the \"Yes I do want to re-download this app I purchased\" hoops is handy.\nIf you deleted an app because of crashes or general instability, than you can watch iTunes and wait for it to update, and then update it and see if it's better.\nWhy is best answered by Apple themselves, as it was obviously a design consideration that I'm not sure anyone else here will have the answer too.\nBut unfortunately I don't believe you can change it. The easiest way to change it would be to delete apps only via iTunes, and not on your iPhone directly.\n", "Q: iMac Scrambled Graphics Issues - Hardware or Software?

After clicking on the \"Show downloads\" icon, a dialog-like window appears.\n\nUnfortunately switching tabs or clicking in a text area makes the downloads window disappear. Is there a way to keep the downloads window open just like in OS X 10.6 running Safari 5?\n\nA: One minor workaround is to have the Downloads folder in your Dock, set to Stack. That way, at the very least, you can see the status of the most recent download without needing to open/manage a separate window by just glancing at the Dock. It's not the same obviously, but it's something.\n\n\nA: You can open a new Safari window, show the downloads window in that window, then return to your original window. The downloads window in the 2nd window will remain open.\n\nA: There is no way to keep the popover window open, it will close whenever you navigate away as you have found.\nIf you are wanting to see the window purely to monitor the progress of the download perhaps to see when it has completed, you can create a saved search folder to do a similar thing which may help.  Navigate to the download folder in Finder, and search for \",download\", which is the extension given to files that are currently downloading.  Save the search, call it \"currently downloading\" or something and add it to your side bar.  Now, so long as you have this window open somewhere, you can view the progress of downloads, and if you use icon view the progress per download is displayed in the icon itself.\nOf course, this does not retain a list of downloaded files after they finish which you need to clear every so often like the popover window, or provide download speed/time indications, but it may be a suitable workaround spending on your reasons for keeping it in view. \n", "Q: Lion Safari's enabled and disabled button contrast is so low it's hard to see the difference Is it me or is Lion's buttons' contrast way too low?

I tried System Preferences - Universal Access - Display - Enhance contrast, but it doesn't really enhance the contrast of the button.\n\nA: Nope, sadly, there is no UI control for changing such contrast. You'd have to play within the app's insides and it may cause problems down the way, and might have to be done every time the app is update. Therefore, much less trouble to live with it than change it. :-)\n", "Q: Why does it take so long for the Application folder to open? My computer is pretty snappy, and the UI is typically silky-smooth. However, for some reason, on virtually every Mac OS X computer I've used, opening the Applications folder takes an inordinate (>5 s) amount of time before any icons are shown in the window. Does anyone here know:\n\n\n*\n\n*What the heck is the computer doing?\n\n*How to speed this up?\n\n\nA: OS X applications are actually special folders which contain numerous smaller files, resources, binaries, localization settings, etc. When the Finder opens a folder with a lot of apps, it needs to do a lot more than it would to open a folder with the same number of ordinary documents.\nAt the very least, the Finder needs to check for the localized name of each app and load each app's icon. It will also need to check whether it can launch the app, checking if it's Intel, PPC, Universal, or Classic, possibly checking if it's 64-bit or 32-bit, too.\nIt's possible the Finder is gathering other info as well, possibly checking the folder structure of each app to verify it's actually an app, or checking its info.plist for file type associations, etc. Lion may also verify that each app is listed in Launchpad.\nOf course, the more apps you have, the longer this process will take. I would guess that, unless your Macs are starved for RAM, the only way to make this process faster is to startup from an SSD instead of a conventional HD. Or perhaps delete all unneeded apps (that were not installed by OS X).\nAlso, the first time after each login, the Applications and Utilities folders may be slightly less responsive initially, even after the apps have shown up, because the Finder also needs to examine each app to calculate its total file size.\n\nA: Your experiencing a slow down both by limited ram (as icons are being saved to ram, space must first be cleared out from the inactive memory) and a slow (relatively speaking) hard drive read speed. The easiest fix would be a simple RAM upgrade in the case of constantly having 100% memory usage.\n\nA: When you open the Applications folder OS X \"calculates\" the sizes of each application by default. If you have a bunch of apps then the time it takes to do this process is longer; you will also notice it when scrolling through your applications initially upon a reboot/login. \nHow to speed it up? You can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder > View Options > Calculate All Sizes [un-check]\n\n*Switching to View as List instead of Icons can help also.\n\n\nA: I have only a few applications that I use regularly, so I put all the others in a sub-folder called \"Rarely used apps\".  When I open the Applications folder, Finder doesn't have to slog through the contents of the sub-folder.\n", "Q: Display is set to Mobile PC Display on Windows when I run it on  Macbook Pro via boot camp Just installed Windows using boot camp.

The document has multiple sections and sometime on a single page, I'll have an end of a section and a start of another section. \nI cannot figure out how to add Section Break on the same page. Normally, the newer section would override the previous section on the same page, but in Pages, adding a Section Break in the middle of the page will throw you to a new page (Section Break + Pages Break). I want to remain both section on the same page.\nI need to Section Break for footer and table of content.\n\nA: It appears that while a Layout Break has the option to start a new page or not start a new page,\n\na Section Break always starts a new page. Thus, the header at the top of the page is always from the same section as the footer at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nA: I had the same question and found the answer at http://support.apple.com/kb/PH15334. You just have to select the section you want to change. In my case I wanted to have two columns on part of the page. I selected that section, then went to the inspector and selected two columns in the text section.\n", "Q: iPhone Mail, Send only account I have an account on dreamhost that autoforwards everything on to my GMail. This is fine as it all gets pulled into my phone, but if I try to reply on my iPhone, it shows the google address, not the fancy forwarded address.\nTo fix this I attempted to add the forwarded account via IMAP to my phone, fixing the problem, and introducing a second. Now I have duplicates of emails one for GMail and one for the original account. What'smore, spam sent to the fancy email is not being filtered, so I'm getting both duplicates of normal emails, and unfiltered spam.\nWhat I'd like is to set my iPhone so it can send from that account, but either does not check for emails, or cannot check for emails.\nIn the past I've set my phone up to use the 'from' trick, which has almost worked ( users can still tell it's not quite from that address though it gives the illusion ), and the instructions fail when applied to iOS5 ( impending death of the trick? )\n\nA: I have found the solution!\nI set up a second email account on my server with an obscure name, then, I changed the POP/IMAP settings to use that account for receiving, and left the send/SMTP details unchanged.\nThis now gives me the desired behaviour. It also gives me a receive only account ( which could also be desirable ).\nIf you are on iOS4 or below, you can also refer to Hand-E-Food's answer. My instructions will work for iOS5 ( due to the extra checks iOS5 makes to verify what you've entered )\n\nA: Got it to work!\nStep 1)  Create a new account on the same domain that will not receive emails.  (I would assume this might work using another domain IMAP address you have proper credentials for, however, this is not what I did or tested)\nStep 2)  Create a new IMAP email account on iOS.  Provide only the credentials of the email account you want to use for sending emails (not the account created in Step 1).  Let it verify and completely setup this way.\nStep 3)  Alter the new IMAP email account on iOS.  Change the Incoming Mail Server's User Name and Password to the account you created in Step 1.  Let it verify.\nStep 4)  Alter your default account to this new account for sending emails in iOS.\n\nA: I have a similar set up.  I use mBox Mail to handle Hotmail.

Rather than using the built-in default \"Gmail\" account type on my iPhone, I set my Gmail account up using the generic \"Other\" account type, which allows you to specify IMAP and SMTP server details separately. For the SMTP server details, I used my Fastmail credentials, and for the IMAP server details, I entered my Gmail credentials.\n", "Q: App to empty trash on a single drive The \"Empty Trash\" is a bit non-specific for me, as it empties the trash on all connected volumes.  In order to empty trash from a single drive (for instance, on a USB stick), I've been going to the terminal and using:\nsudo rm -R /Volumes/<volume_name>/.Trashes\n\nWhat I'd really like is some App/Finder Extension/Menulet/etc that would let me empty the trash without having to run to the terminal (and without having to supply a password).  \nI could wrap the bash command in an Applescript/Automator script, but supplying the volume name is troublesome.\nAny ideas?  Bonus points if I can choose to \"Securely Empty Trash.\" \n\nA: You can easily empty Trash on a specific drive with the Finder. There's no need to use a command line or any external software.\nThe trick is that Finder can remove files directly, without using Trash.\nThe solution\n\n*\n\n*Open the root folder of the USB drive in Finder and press Cmd+Shift+. to show hidden files.\n\n*Find the .Trashes folder, then press Opt+Del and confirm the permanent removal.\n\n\n\n\n*Press Cmd+Shift+. again to stash away hidden files.\n\nThe conclusion\nIf you need to permanently delete something in Finder – just press Opt+Del and confirm the removal.\n\nA: I haven't tried it myself, but had this conversation with someone else who used SmartTrash. Give it a go.\n\nA: I had a bit of time and the occasional need for something like this, so I thought I'd try writing up a quick AppleScript to do this.\nThe following AppleScript should do what you need. Paste it into a new AppleScript Editor document and save it as an application, then you can drag a volume onto it to delete only its files from the Trash. \nIf you drag your startup disk to it, it will delete files from the current user's Trash in their home folder. \nIf you drop multiple volumes on the script, it will empty all of their trashes.\nThe script only looks at the current user's trashes on volumes. On non-startup volumes (partitions & external drives), the user's trash is in /Volumes/volumeName/.Trashes/userID/; on the startup volume, it looks in ~/.Trash/.\nIt will ignore anything dropped onto it that is not a volume.\n\nThere are a few properties you can change to alter how it behaves.\nPrompt for Secure Delete - If you want the script to ask you each time whether to delete securely, set the askForSecureEmpty property to true (at the top of the script).\nDefault Delete Command (rm or srm) - If you don't want the script to ask you each time, set askForSecureEmpty to false, then set rmDefault to either rm for normal or srm for secure.\nDisable Trivial Dialogs - The script will show a dialog if it didn't find any Trash files to empty, e.g. if there were no files in that volume's Trash. To disable these, change the property, showDialogs to false. If there is an actual error while trying to delete files from a volume's Trash, you will still get an error message.\n\nDisclaimer\nThe rm command can be very destructive. I wrote this script fairly quickly and only tested it on my own Mac, so please use it with caution and at your own risk. That said, it really shouldn't do anything to any files that are not already in a Trash folder somewhere.\nOne scenario I have not tested that could cause a problem is if you have two or more volumes with the same name. \nAny ideas to clean up or improve the script are welcome.\n-- Script to empty selected volumes' trashes --\n\nproperty askForSecureEmpty : false -- change to true if you want to choose each time script is used\nproperty rmDefault : \"rm\" -- command to use when askForSecureEmpty is \"false\"; use \"rm\" for regular, \"srm\" for secure\nproperty showDialogs : true\n\non run\n    set theVolumes to {choose folder}\n    emptyTrash(theVolumes)\nend run\n\non open theVolumes\n    emptyTrash(theVolumes)\nend open\n\non emptyTrash(theVolumes)\n    if askForSecureEmpty then\n        set useSecure to display dialog \"Use Secure Empty Trash?\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"No\", \"Secure\"} default button \"Secure\"\n        if useSecure is \"Secure\" then\n            set rmCommand to \"srm\"\n        else\n            set rmCommand to \"rm\"\n        end if\n    else\n        set rmCommand to rmDefault\n    end if\n\n    -- Get the user ID to empty only the current user's Trash --\n    set userID to user ID of (system info)\n\n    -- Set up a counter to later determine if any volumes were dropped on the script --\n    set volumeCount to 0\n\n    -- Cycle through each item dropped on the script to empty its Trash --\n    repeat with theVolume in theVolumes\n        if kind of (info for theVolume) is \"Volume\" then --ignore anything that's not a volume\n            set volumeCount to volumeCount + 1\n            set volumeName to name of (info for theVolume)\n\n            -- Check if we're working on the startup disk, if so use user's home Trash --\n            tell application \"System Events\" to set startupVolume to name of startup disk\n            if volumeName = startupVolume then\n                set trashPath to \"~/.Trash/\"\n            else\n                set trashPath to quoted form of (POSIX path of theVolume & \".Trashes/\" & userID & \"/\")\n            end if\n\n            -- Try emptying the trash --\n            try\n                do shell script \"cd \" & trashPath --make sure the expected Trash folder exists\n                if (count (paragraphs of (do shell script \"ls -l \" & trashPath))) > 0 then\n                    try\n                        do shell script \"cd \" & trashPath & \"; \" & rmCommand & \" -R ./*\" --try to empty the trash\n                    on error\n                        display alert \"Error on volume \" & volumeName as warning message \"There was an error trying to delete the files.\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"OK\"} default button \"OK\"\n                    end try\n                else\n                    if showDialogs then display dialog \"The Trash for volume '\" & volumeName & \"' appears to be empty.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button \"OK\"\n                end if\n            on error\n                if showDialogs then display dialog \"No Trash folder on '\" & volumeName & \"' for this user.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button \"OK\"\n            end try\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    -- Report an error if no volumes were found --\n    if volumeCount = 0 and showDialogs then display dialog \"No volumes found.\"\nend emptyTrash\n\n\nA: I use Cocktail for this, which I already have for other reasons.\n\nA: Here's one freeware option (Smart Trash and Cocktail are commercial):  Super Empty Trash\nSeems to work fine - very simple, delete from one volume at a time.\n\nA: A very simple GUI-based solution (for SD cards, USB sticks and external disks).\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount the disk you want to 'clean'.\n\n*Create 'temp trash' folder on desktop and drag everything out of trash into this temp folder.\n\n*Now mount disk and open trash - hey presto only the trash files on the disk you want to clean.\n\n*Empty trash\n\n*Now drag everything from your temp folder back into the trash.\n\n*For good measure you can now drag the temp folder in to the trash too.\n\n*Job done\n\n", "Q: Autodeleting resource forks on FAT disks I totally hate to see those .dsstore and resource files on my Windows disks.\nIs there a free program that will autodelete those files on specified disks on logout/eject?\n\nA: There are many ways to remove .DS_Store files; it really depends on what your exact needs are for the method you decide to use.

As from itunes library, my advise would be to move it temporary to a non user related location (not under any user 'users' folder) during the copy.\n\nA: If you use Migration Assistant you will be able to migrate whatever you want while also choosing what not to migrate.

I have a 2007 macbook pro and two keys are not working on the built in keyboard.\nI tried cleaning the keys by removing the keys and the plastic under it but that didn't help.\nAfter removing the keys, tried to depress the plastic blob underneath to make it work but that didn't work either.\nWhat options do I have? Am planning to take it to the local apple store to see what can be done if all else fails\n\nA: Your two options are roughly;\n\n\n*\n\n*You can still take it into the Apple Store, and they can repair it. Obviously, for a cost. Your question notes that you appear to need a whole new keyboard tray, as it's not just a key dead at the surface-level. I don't know how much this would cost, you could perhaps call ahead to save you a trip and essentially just get an expected quote.\n\n*Fix it yourself. I love iFixIt for this purpose, start at their MacBook Pro parts page, pick your MacBook Pro's size/model, and check the price for the \"upper case\" part. I can't imagine that specific key death could be anything other than the keyboard tray and particular circuit boards attached to it.\n\nA: I have had the same problem especially if it is cold (MacBook Pro (2010)). Usually I can solve it by pressing Alt/Opt and the key you want to work (don't ask how I came up with that solution). It might not work for you but that is what I do.\n\nA: If you feel confident with screwdriver you can just buy keyboard from ebay. There are plenty of these keyboards. And install it using this guide from ifixit.\n\nA: If you take it to the Apple Store as VxJasonxV mentioned, they normally charge a flat fee to repair it off-site, regardless of what's wrong with it. They'll repair anything that's broken for that one off charge. I think it was something around 280 (plus tax) for a Macbook, Pro may be a bit more. So if the keyboard is the only thing broken, I would definitely go the DIY route.\n", "Q: Is there a key to trigger the home button on an external iPad keyboard? Is there a keyboard shortcut to trigger pressing the home button on an iPad when using it with an apple (bluetooth) keyboard?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the answer appears to be no. The Apple iPad Keyboard Dock for the first generation iPad had a physical home button on the keyboard, but successor products compatible with the iPad 2, including the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard have been unable to replicate this feature. Not the answer you're hoping for, I'm sure, but I'm afraid it's the answer, for now. Of course, Apple could change all this with a software update.\n", "Q: Can a MacBook act as bluetooth headset?

Or even better using WiFi?\n\nA: Get Phone Amego from the Mac AppStore. I was looking for the same thing this morning and it worked great! It was very easy to setup.\n\nA: You can do it. There is an app called BluePhoneElite. With it, you can receive and send call, sms. You can even import and save your call lists and sms.\nBut it was discontinued. You can get it at Softpedia.\nhttp://mac.softpedia.com/get/Communications/BluePhoneElite.shtml\n\nA: I haven't tested this, but I've heard that Phonecall Wizard can do this from a thread  on Apple Support Communities: Can my Mac act as a Bluetooth headset?\nAs for over Wi-Fi...I doubt it. For Android, it wouldn't be too hard to make such an application, but I failed to find one.

The Finder was not responding, so I control+click'd the Finder icon on the Dock and chose Relaunch… except that it didn't relaunch.\nActivity Monitor happened to be visible and I could see that it listed Finder (including the PID) and showed it as \"Not Responding.\"\nI was in iTerm, so I tried killall Finder and was told \"No processes belonging to you were found\" (or words to that effect).\nI tried to send \"kill\" to the PID I could see for Finder, and was told there was no such PID. This led me to assume that the WindowServer was not showing accurate information anymore.\nI tried sudo killall -HUP WindowServer which made the entire GUI go away, and left me with a black screen and some white letters on it (not the panic screen, more like console log messages).\nThe message was:\n\nSep 27 17:17:23 Pro kernel[0]: V1.4.0: TrustedData_driver_VendorSpecificType00::vendorSpecificPassThroughIn(): SendCommand failed, task not complete, serviceResponse = 1, TaskStatus: 2\nSep 27 17:17:23 Pro kernel[0]: V1.4.0: TrustedData_UserClient_SCSIType00::vendorSpecificPassThroughIn() returning failure from driver: 3758097084\n\nSo now I have a black screen, but and I can type but it has no effect (the letters appear on the screen, but don't actually execute.

Launchd is more or less the OS X version of init under Linux.  It technically isn't the first process, but it might as well be.  If it goes, then the system simply isn't going to be able to shutdown properly.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I just found a non-obvious answer.

There are a number of remote access apps (from Citrix, etc.) that allow you to run Windows apps remotely on an iPad.\nI need one that would allow me to remotely run (on an iPad) a Windows app with sound, so that I'd hear (on the iPad) the audio of the Windows app. Ideally it would also allow recording of sound on the iPad into the Windows program.\n\nA: The only rdp client I know of that records through the iPad onto the host is \"iRDP AV\".  The only problem is it doesn't have the functionality that many other RDP apps have such as two-finger scrolling, etc.  It's only 2.99 though and definitely worth it if you just need basic desktop control and mic functionality.\n\nA: LogMeIn Ignition is a great app for remotely accessing a variety of desktops. \nYou need to install an app on the target host but with this you can use the Ignition iPhone/iPad app (non-free) and browser app (free) as you wish.

The sound will work on Windows XP as well but , IIRC, you get sound thru the app AND through the PC, which means that if the PC is nearby (the case in my scenario) you get double audio. Windows 7 allows the app to disable the local sound (so you'd only get the sound thru the app and NOT through Windows).\nI have NOT found a solution that allows RECORDING audio through the ipad to the PC.\n", "Q: How many unlocked iPhones (no contract) can you buy from an Apple store? I'm planning on buying the iPhone 4S from the Apple store when it comes out next week (waiting in line in NYC shouldn't be too bad).  In the past, how many unlocked iPhones will they let you purchase at the Apple store?\n\nA: Selling unlocked phones is a fairly new thing for Apple retail. They've never been part of a product launch - so looking back, the precedent is NIL. There is great precedent for any new phone launch to have lines and quotas for the first 30 to 60 days after a product introduction. There also is precedent for a huge shipment on launch day - then limited stock for a few weeks as things sell faster than they can be made.\nI would simply stop by your store and get to know the business team if you have business needs. Until the policy is announced, it should be handled like any other phone in terms of what payment is allowed (cash or not) as well as purchase limits.\nThe last launch, it was one phone per person while availability was limited and one web order at a time. Once the stores stopped selling out of inventory on a daily basis, it was easier to just walk in and get a phone. Last time I checked, the store has to bring out a different physical box when I purchased an unlocked phone ( I changed my mind about AT&T contract half way through the process). The current stock does ship as an AT&T phone or an unlocked GSM phone - they are not the same SKU. \nI suppose the computers could use a common stock and \"unlock\" the device when selling, but that would be different than what happens today. I do know that the iOS app to reserve product worked very well last launch, so do think about getting that installed if you are keen to get a few phones as soon as iOS 5 launches.\n\nA: There is currently no limit to the number of iPhones a person may buy. However, during the launch of a new product Apple has sometimes had to impose a limit. The original iPhone, for example, had a limit of two per person/credit card (they disallowed cash sales so that people couldn't get around it).\nIn addition to limiting the actual sale, Apple has sometimes limited the number of devices someone can pre-order. For the iPhone 4 last year you could pre-order at most 2 per person/credit card. \n", "Q: Exporting MobileMe Contacts into Outlook I've just been through a bit of wringer with this! :-)\nI have a client with a MobileMe account and about 350+ contacts in there. He asked me to see if there was \"an easy way\" to copy the contacts from MobileMe into Outlook 2011 (Mac). \nMy background is primarily Windows-centric so I researched possibilities this way.\nThe first thing I did was export all the contacts from me.com into a multi-vcard file. I found out quickly that Outlook doesn't support importing multi-vcard formatted files. I found applications that would do it, but I preferred to stay away from buying something if possible.\nSo, I happened upon an Apple KB article about syncing with Outlook. It looked dead-on-simple. Turn on the option and away one goes. I did this on a Windows machine with Outlook 2010 x64. \nWelll, it didn't turn out to be that simple. \nWhat ultimately happened is that any MobileMe contact information that didn't conform neatly to Outlook's built-in fields was simply lost. This was a bit of a disaster since that malformed data then neatly (and succinctly) synced BACK INTO MOBILEME and spread it's erased mischievousness across the client's iPhone and three other Macs.\nI had made a backup, so I've just finished restoring the original exported data. It's not perfect. Group memberships and contact photos were lost, but the client is not worried about those things.\nSo, I'm doing now what I, perhaps, should have asked in the first place. Can I accomplish the original goal?\nI am loathe to reconnect MobileMe and Outlook through any sort of sync partnership. I have the original exported vCard but I still have the issue of fields within the vCards that do not conform to Outlook fields. \nHas anyone else successfully done this? Any tips?\nCheers,\nM\n\nA: Do you have access to an Exchange server?  Is your Client using Outlook 2011 for Mac in an Exchange Environment?\nIf so, it is super simple to get your data into Outlook.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the Mac to Exchange (Address Book settings)\n\n*Move all address book cards from \"On My Mac\" to the Exchange Account\n\n*Open Outlook and...   Bang! there they all are.\nWell... the \"bang!\" was a little dramatic... really you will need to wait a bit while the address sync over..\nI have done it a million times.\n", "Q: User changed to 502 on OSX I have a small problem with my permissions. I use rsync frequently on a certain target directory, but one day I by accident I used \"sudo rsync\", and now all my permissions for the files in the directory have been changed to user 502. Can anyone provide me with a clue as to why this happened, and why user 502? thanks. \n\nA: When you create an account on a Mac, it is 501.\nThe 2nd account you create is 502. And so on.\nWhen you use rsync, it copies the files as your User ID because that's all a non-root user can do.\nWhen you ran rsync as 'sudo' it thought you wanted to copy the user as well as the file.\nYou should be able to fix it with \nsudo chown -R $USER /path/to/rsync'd/files/\nps - you can see your user number using the id command in Terminal.\n\nA: It's much easier to just delete and recreate your users.\nYou can see which user has 501 (if any) with the id 501 command. Delete that user and keep the home directory.\nThen delete your 502 user (you'll need to make a third admin account to do all this deleting). Again keep the home folder.\nGo into terminal and use sudo to mv /Users/short\\ (Deleted) /Users/short and then take care to add that user back using the system preference. It will change all the 502 permissions back to 501. You can then recreate the offending 501 user (if it was still around) and it will become 502.\nMuch easier in the long run - as long as you don't delete the home folders, you won't loose any files and the UID will match again with your primary users on both machines being 501. \n", "Q: Curve text in Microsoft Word for Mac 2011 How can I make my text follow a curve or arch shape in Microsoft Word for Mac 2011?\n\nA: Insert -> WordArt, then Format tab appears.\nClick Review tab.\nClick Format tab again.\nNow, click Effects button (\"A\"), and select \"Transform\" from the drop-down menu.\nThe arch, wavy lines, and other formats are shown under the \"Warp\" section on the ribbon.\n\nA: In Office 11 (Mac) at the top, go to VIEW and make sure \"Standard\" is selected under \"Toolbars\". Go to Insert → WordArt. Type in your text in the wordart box. Hit the \"Format\" button, right next to \"Home\". One of your new selections under \"Text Styles\" should be \"Effects\". Click on Effects and select the last selection, \"Transform\".\nYou should have a whole selection of options including curving text up or down, and making circles. You can edit the curvature by pulling on the text box handles, up and down, and on the corners. You can rotate the text box by clicking and holding on the long \"knob\" on the text box.\n\nA: Here is a graphic showing how to do this in Word 2011 for Mac:\n\n\nA: Still a little hidden, but here's one way to get there . . .\nStart a text box\nSelect INSERT and then Word Art\nChoose your Word Art style and write your phrase\nHighlight it\nGo to the TOOLBOX section QUICK STYLES AND EFFECTS and choose the abc option\nThen play with the magenta square on the text box and the size of the text box (as well as the rotate text box) to get the curve you want\nA little harder than on a PC but everything else is worth this minor hassle.\n", "Q: Mount RAM Disk at boot with a specific path? I'd love to mount a RAM Disk in OSX Lion on boot.  I know how to write the launchd stuff to do it when I want, but is it possible to mount a RAM Disk onto a certain path, so that it would be cleared on boot?\n\nA: With regards to your question, there doesn't seem to be a way to mount it at a specific point, hover to mount it at boot, have you looked at the Make RAM Disk application?\n\nMake RAM Disk is an application that provides an easy way to create, format, and mount a RAM disk in one shot.\n\nIf you add the application to your Login Items it will automatically create the RAM disk at each boot.\nPS: Tested this on OSX Lion without any issues.\nFor completeness sake the following is from the Readme File:\n\nHow do I use it?\n  Just run it. By default, it creates a 64-MiB RAM disk named “RAM Disk”.\nCan I have it create a RAM disk on startup/login?\n  Yes. Add it to your Login Items in the Accounts pane of System Preferences.\nHow do I get rid of the RAM disk?\n  Click on the Eject (⏏) button next to its name in the Finder's sidebar. Alternatively, use Disk Utility (in /Applications/Utilities) to eject it.\nI want to create a bigger or smaller RAM disk or to create it with a different name. How do I do that?\n  Hold down the Option key while launching Make RAM Disk; it will present a window wherein you can change the size or name of the volume. If the “Save settings for next time” checkbox is checked, the settings you enter here will be saved (obviously); if not, they are forgotten just before quitting.    \nRemember: the Option key for the Options window.\nCan I change the options without actually creating a RAM disk?\n  Yes. As long as the box is checked, the options will be saved, whether you create a RAM disk or not.\n\n", "Q: Technical reason that 2011 MacBook Air is maxed at 4gb ram I am very interested in the MacBook Air specs and form factor. Both for reasons specific to my software needs (developing using an IDE as well as needing to run a virtual OS on top of the boot OS.) as well as an example of state of the art system design. \nA maximum of 4gb ram is a deal breaker for me. Furthermore from a system architecture stance, this limit feels to me like I am stuck in 2006 with 32bit machines, even if there are not better alternatives in similar form factors. It is like almost there but not quite.\nWhat are the technical reasons that the 2011 macbook air was limited at 4gb ram?\n\nA: Space, ram is soldered onto the MB. So I see price v optimal RAM amount.\n\nA: There is no technical reason for a 4 gb limit to RAM. \nLet's say the designers could buy RAM twice as dense (removing space constraints), and also assume power consumption is negligible. Perhaps with SSD storage and the current controllers / CPU / logic board - RAM past 4g doesn't provide much benefit. \nWithout being privy to design, purchasing and test data we can't know with certainty, but often technical considerations make it easier to not add something even if pricing / availability allows it. \n\nAs an analogy, some bike frames are suited for certain tasks. To reduce size and weight, velodrome track bikes lack items that are \"deal-breakers\" for someone that needs huge cargo capacity. If you need RAM, get a frame built to carry that load...\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to unhide or unminimize a window in OS X I am asking this question because I feel it belongs on apple, not superuser. Also the perfect answer is not checked off there.\nYou hide a window using ⌘ + M. However even ⌘ + ⇥ to that window does not help as the window is minimized. How do you unminimize?\n\nA: A very quick keyboard method to un-minimize a specific window or un-minimize all of an app's minimized windows is this:\nCommand ⌘+Tab ⇥ to the app with minimized windows, but don't release the Command ⌘ key.\nWhile still holding Command ⌘ down, tap Down ↓ or 1 (easy 1-handed access) to enter App Exposé. Once in App Exposé, all keys can be released.\nTo un-minimize all windows, select any window with arrow keys, then press Option ⌥+Return ↩.\nTo un-minimize a specific window, navigate to the window you want with the arrow keys, then press Return ↩.\n\nA: When you ⌘ + ⇥ to that application, hold the ⌥ key before releasing ⌘. This will reopen the application, typically bringing up a minimized window if there are no other windows up.\nAn alternative is to minimize using ⌘ + H which hides the window, but does not actually minimize it, therefore you can still ⌘ + ⇥ to it without any special action.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse Middle Click in Windows 7 64-bit Bootcamp? This question might be similar to some that others have posted, but I want to be more specific: Does anyone know how to enable Magic Mouse's middle-click in Windows Bootcamp (specifically Win 7 x64)? \nIn OS X we can use MagicPrefs or Better Touch Tool, I'm looking for their counterparts in Windows. Also, this feature is enabled in Windows Guests if we use Parallels or VMWare Fusion while having the aforementioned tools active in OS X.\n\nA: I have found a partial solution:\nUsing AutoIt, an automation software for Windows, the middle-click can be simulated by pressing ctrl-left click using the following script:\n#include <Misc.au3>\n\nGlobal $iFlag = 0\n\nWhile Not _IsPressed(\"1B\") ;Esc to quit\n    If _IsPressed(\"01\") And _IsPressed(\"11\") And Not $iFlag Then\n        $iFlag = MouseDown(\"Middle\")\n    ElseIf Not _IsPressed(\"01\") And Not _IsPressed(\"11\") And $iFlag Then\n        $iFlag = (MouseUp(\"Middle\") <> 1)\n    EndIf\n    Sleep(20)\nWEnd\n\nThe script is taken and modified from here: http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/132174-simulate-middle-mouse-click/, which is exactly the same scenario that I am facing. The script can be compiled to an .exe, which I have already done. If anyone's interested, I can share it.\nThis solution has a drawback, however. It can only simulate middle-clicks, you can not middle-click-drags.\n", "Q: What does \"More…\" mean in the Finder's \"All my Files\" view? In the Finder's view \"All My Files\", I can see a button \"More…\"... what does this button mean? Why is it there in the first place?\n\nEdit: The button is not always there. If I click on it, the message \"Searching All My Files\" appears in the bottom, and the button disappears... ?!??\nSometimes when I click the button, it takes forever, and new categories appear, like \"Events and Todos\"...\nI'm still clueless as to what this button is supposed to do.\nTerrible user interface design, in my opinion...\n\nA: Simply put, the aptly named button \"More…\" loads more results.\nBy default† the \"All My Files\" smart folder is arranged by kind and sorted by last access time. Arranging means those blocks that contains files belonging to its category type (e.g. Movies or Music) and sorting means the order the files are sorted within the block.\nAll My Files is all about you, so ask yourself: what would be your most typical use–case scenario involving this smart folder?\nI use last access time for both arranging and sorting the folder. I have categories of \"Today\", \"Yesterday\", \"Last 7 days\", \"Last 30 days\" and \"Earlier\" and within every category the items are sorted by the last access time during its period.\nNow, this is where the More… button shines: All My Files folder is a smart folder which means the contents are generated by a Spotlight search. That means the more results it tries to query the longer it takes to make the contents usable. Question is, would you rather\n\n\n*\n\n*see the most relevant files quickly\n\n*see the whole lot of your files after staring at slowly updating, laggy, maybe blank Finder window for quite some time?\n\n\nFor reference, when both arranging and sorting the All My Files by last access time, the results I get after consequent presses of More… button are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Today: 2 → 3 → 4\n\n*Yesterday: 14 → 15 → 16\n\n*Last 7 days: 185 → 193 → 198\n\n*Last 30 days: 354 → 364 → 373\n\n*Earlier: 9445 → 19425 → 72145\nAfter the second press the button is gone, probably indicating all the available files have been found.\nNow the odds are the file I'm looking for can be found from the initial search (which already returns 10000‡ results)—and if not, the All My Files folder may not be the best tool to search for the file in the first place.\nHonestly, at times I'd wish for a Less… button, for even more responsive All My Files usage; 10000 results are more than enough.\nFinally, if you happen to realize the All My Files folder doesn't quite suite your workflow, you can, of course, remove it from your sidebar.\n\n†) I'm not 100% if these are the default settings, but I could assume so.\n‡) You might notice that after the second press I get a total of 20000 results—there's some logic applied!\n", "Q: How can I extract multipart iso files in Mac OS X?

It's incredibly fast and utilizes the audio command-line encoding tool LAME (my favorite), which compliments it almost perfectly. To be quite honest, it has so many uses that I would never be able to explain them all; It's definitely a winner in my book, so check it out.\nFor parameters that all depends on you, your setup, and what your expectations are. Without knowing which encoder you plan on using, or have installed, there are just too many variables involved to specifically to tell you which arguments should be used. If you need help with that part of it once you compile/install it then I'm sure someone here can help you out.\n\nA:  ffmpegX\nNever used it before, but I did some research and found ffmpegX. Hope it helps!\n", "Q: What happens with existing apps on device when synching with new computer? I am synching my iPad with multiple computers. I now want to switch my \"main\" computer (as in the computer I really do the syncing with). Now the problem is that when I uncheck \"Sync Apps\" on the other computer, a dialog box says the following:\n\nBecause of this dialog I managed all my apps solely via the iPad. I do not want iTunes to delete my apps on the iPad, only that I will have to re-download them on my other computer and re-synch them anew.\nWhat will happen when I click \"Don't Sync Apps\" now? Will it really delete all apps on the iPad?\n\nA: At that point, yes - if you click Don't Sync Apps you are telling iTunes to reset the link between another iTunes library and your iPad - which will result in this computer deleting your apps on the device and replacing them with the apps on that iTunes Library. Cancel should let the rest of the sync proceed and leave your apps alone this time. Go into the Apps tab and deselect app syncing to prevent this message from coming back the next time you connect.\nThe iOS devices and iTunes are happy to have different computers feed it Apps, Information, Music, etc...\n\nI don't see an authoritative document specifying how many different computers can routinely share syncing duties - each providing the minimum amount of content in terms of the Info / Apps / Ringtones (etc...) tabs in iTunes.\nMy experience is the six music related tabs are treated as one, so you could have your device get data from 5 different computers and not have any problems. In your case - you could easily sync everything but apps from computer A and the apps from computer B.\n\niTunes stores the App purchase history and syncing in preference files as well as in two locations on a Mac or a PC.\nThe two or three folders you need to move are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iOS backup folder maintained by iTunes\n\n*The iTunes database folder (which contains everything else - except for potentially the music files)\n\n*The iTunes media folder(s) (which may be consolidated in one folder or scattered across multiple drives or network locations in the worst case)\n\n\nAssuming you want everything to move from the old computer to the new one and the new one has nothing (you can overwrite everything there), you simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Optionally - consolidate all the music media to one folder (for ease of transfer and surety the library will link correctly when moved) \n\n*Quit iTunes (to close all files properly before the move)\n\n*Move the backup folder (they are just plain files/folders)\n\n*Move the iTunes Library folder as well as the media\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes for Windows: Moving your iTunes Media folder\n\n*iTunes for Mac: Moving your iTunes Media folder\nThe first time you launch iTunes on the new mac - just be sure no devices are connected and go to preferences and review the settings - make sure the music library points to the correct folder on the new mac and try playing a song or two. You can then connect your devices and resume normal sync/backup as if the new computer was the old one. Do use care to destroy / not use the old computer - the device could get confused if you sync to two versions of the \"same library\".\n\nA: If you tell iTunes to sync, It will backup your apps from i*xxx to your \"main\" computer.\nMore informations here Syncing and Backups\n", "Q: App on MAS that writes mathematical formulae into an image?

That way you'll get antialiasing for small fonts.\n(I never understood why they have to let you select that - under 8px fonts are just not readable without antialiasing)\n\nA: If you go to Safari's preferences > Advanced and set \"Never use font sizes smaller than\" to 11, it should fix the anti aliasing problem.\nFor color highlighting you can use a SIMBL plugin called Safari Source that will do that for you.\nUPDATE: Actually, in the Safari Source settings page (Safari>Preferences>Safari Source) you can set the font size for the view source page. So set it to anything above 11 and it'll antialias.\n\nA: BetterSource\n\nIt's similar to the view source in Chrome in a lot of ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*It has syntax highlighting and line numbers\n\n*It's opened in a tab instead of a window\n\n*Uses the default monospace font specified in preferences instead of Monaco 12\n\n\nLimitations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Line numbers are included in selections\n\n*The source view cannot be opened with a shortcut\n\n*Takes slightly longer to appear than the normal source window\n\n\n\nSetting a default zoom level in a custom style sheet\nThe custom style sheet you can specify in the Advanced tab of the preferences also affects the view source window.

I realize that iTunes is a little slow on windows in general.  But dealing with my stuff locally is workable.  But whenever I use iTunes to go the iTunes Store, that tab takes a long time to do anything.  The home page takes a couple of minutes.  I have a fast internet connection using IE or Firefox.  (Comcast 12MB service)\nAny thoughts on how to make the iTunes store go faster?\n\nA: No. The only way to speed up iTunes is to get a faster PC or Mac. It's a bloated program with a lot of legacy code in it. It's been needing a complete overhaul for years now (even on the Mac). And as time passes, it just seems to get bigger as more is continually added.\nWith that said, the speed of iTunes is dependent on your Internet connection but it's also dependent on the power of your PC. Having broadband allows data to transfer quickly from Apple's servers but crunching all that data requires CPU cycles and a lot of RAM too.\n\nA: Make sure you have updated iTunes to the latest version.\n\n\nA: Are you using DNS servers other than those of your ISP, such as Google DNS or OpenDNS? Because the iTunes Store backend uses your geographic location based on your DNS servers to speed things up, if you use DNS servers other than the ones from your ISP, it can slow things down. This mostly applies to content downloads, but I've found it can speed up the Store browser as well.\nIt's also worth noting that in my experience the Store browser generally feels slower than you'd expect given that it's basically glorified web pages.\n", "Q: Will a 120Hz monitor work with Thunderbolt?

I don't want to lose my files and Angry Birds progress if they need to wipe the iPad or something...\n\nA: It may well be that your iPad simply needs to be restarted in order to clean up the system memory.\nOptional App Report\nYou can force the app to quit (which may result in losing information about your last trip or pin drop) and send a crash report to Apple by forcing it to quit in a specific way:\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the power button on the top until \"Slide to Power Off\" appears\n\n*Don't slide to power off.\n\n*While \"Slide...\" is showing, press and hold the Home button.\n\nThis will force a \"crash\" to let Apple know exactly where the Maps app caused you to feel it needed a \"force quit\" and might help the engineers fix a bug if that's the cause.\nRestarting the iPad\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the power button on the top until \"Slide to Power Off\" appears.\n\n*Slide to power off.\n\n*Turn the iPad back on by pressing and holding the power button until the Apple logo appears.\n\nThe iPad 2 needs a power off less often due to the extra memory it has, but both devices occasionally need the user to force quit a problematic app as well as a clean reboot.\nIf these don't solve the problem then I'd go with the other suggestions here, but a clean restart may well fix things.\n\nA: Your issue sounds like a software issue.\nStart by connecting to iTunes and doing a BACKUP by right clicking (Windows) or CTRL Click (Mac) on the iPad in the left hand panel of iTunes and choose the option to backup.\nWhen backup is complete, click on restore which will wipe the contents of the device and set it back to factory settings. \nTest google maps immediately after the restore is complete to see if it works.\n\nA: You should definitely reach out to Apple for some hints on how to back things up in general and troubleshoot this if you aren't sure your settings are backed up. I've gotten many good tips from the staff - although sometimes a specific genius / AppleCare call is needed in odd ball problems where the normal steps don't help.\nIf you want, you can follow the general app troubleshooting steps.

Want to reformat it I am using a Seagate Free Agent Desk external drive as my Time Machine on a modern iMac running Lion. I made the mistake of encrypting the drive, and I do not remember the password. I dont mind losing the data on the disk, and I just want to reformat it if possible in order to use it as a non encrypted drive. Any ideas on how to do this?\n\nA: The encrypted volume's password is not required for erasing the disk, only to mount the encrypted volume on the disk. It's unclear whether you're being asked for the password only when connecting the disk, or when you attempt to erase it.\nIn Lion, you can use Disk Utility to erase an encrypted volume, but not in Mountain Lion. However, you can erase the encrypted volume with the diskutil cs delete command (see Terminal section below) in both versions.\n\nDisk Utility (Lion only)\nThe following steps should work in Lion:\n\n*\n\n*Connect the disk to your Mac.\n\n\n*When prompted to \"Enter the password for the disk 'your disk',\" click \"Cancel\". You don't need to mount the encrypted volume to erase the disk.\n\n\n\n*Open Disk Utility and locate your external disk on the left side. Its name will likely start with its capacity and include \"Seagate\" or \"Free Agent\" in the name. You should see your encrypted volume directly under the disk. The volume will be indented and grayed out. \n\n\n*Select the disk on the left side, not the volume. \n\n\n*Click the \"Erase\" tab, found between the \"First Aid\" and \"Partition\" tabs. If you don't see the \"Partition\" tab, and all the buttons under the \"Erase\" tab are grayed out, double-check that you've selected the disk on the left side, and not the disk's volume.\n\n\n*Choose a format and enter a name, then click \"Erase\".\nIf this doesn't work, let us know which step is not working and how.\n\nTerminal (Lion & Mountain Lion)\n\n*\n\n*With the encrypted disk connected, launch Terminal and enter the following command\n\ndiskutil cs list\n\nYou should see output describing the encrypted disk, starting with info about the Logical Volume Group:\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 109FC023-5F18-438A-AF3D-14FF60334A0C\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         Le Disque\n    Size:         68375502848 B (68.4 GB)\n    Free Space:   0 B (0 B)\n    |\n…\n\nIf you have more than one encrypted disk, locate the Logical Volume Group with the name of the disk you want to erase.\n\n\n*Copy the UUID which follows the words \"Logical Volume Group\". In this example this is the UUID for the disk named \"Le Disque\":\n109FC023-5F18-438A-AF3D-14FF60334A0C\n\n\n\n*Warning The next command will erase the disk specified by the UUID you enter. Make sure you've copied the correct Logical Volume Group UUID for the disk you want to erase, especially if you have more than one encrypted disk connected.\nEnter the following command to erase the encrypted disk, replacing copiedUUID with the UUID you copied:\ndiskutil cs delete copiedUUID\n\n\n\n*When complete, the disk will be partitioned with one volume mounted, called \"Untitled\". You can then start using it or repartition or encrypt it in Disk Utility as needed.\n\nA: As joelseph said in his answer, you should be able to erase an encrypted volume in Disk Utility even without entering the password. However, I do not have a 10.8 system to test this with, and Ian C. said that 10.8 changed this.\nIf Disk Utility does prevent joelseph's answer from working, wiping out the partition table using the terminal is a viable workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the drive in Disk Utility and click the Info button\n\n*Find the Disk Identifier line and note what it says. It will say disk# where # is a number.\n\n*Open the Terminal (in the Utilities folder) and enter the command:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk# bs=1024k count=1\n\nWhere # is the disk number from step #2. Double check this command! Then, triple check the command. Make sure the /dev/disk# matches the disk# from step #2.\nThis command will overwrite the first megabyte of the disk with zeros, permanently destroying any information on the diks. Be sure you want to continue\n\n*Press return and you will be prompted for your user password. Enter the password to begin erasing the partition table.\n\n*After the process finishes (you will see a message 1+0 records in 1+0 records out 1048576 bytes transferred...) return to Disk Utility. You should now be able to format the drive.\n\n\nThis was confirmed to work in chat. Again, be very careful with the command. If you use the wrong disk you may erase valuble data.\n\nYou should never run terminal commands without understanding what they do. Here is a detailed explanation:\ndd stands for Data Duplicate. It is a standard system command. See the Wikipedia Article and Manual page\nif= specifies the input file to duplicate from. /dev/zero is a special file (actually, a character device) which produces nothing but zeros (NULL characters)\nof= specifies the output file to duplicate to. /dev/disk2 or whatever is the external hard disk to overwrite.\nbs=1024k specifies the block size, meaning write blocks of 1,024 kilobytes (1 megabyte). Writing blocks of 1 MB is simply faster than smaller blocks, that's why I close this size.\ncount=1 specifies how many blocks to write. 1 block of 1 megabyte is sufficient to overwrite the partition table, meaning Disk Utility will no longer know this is a password protected disk and will allow you to format it.\n\nA: Lion's Disk Utility should be able to do this. My encrypted FreeAgent is at home.\nHave you tried both erasing/reformatting the volume, and repartitioning the disk itself? Repartitioning should work.\n\nA: I encountered the same issue. My best option would be to use another formatting utility from another operating system.\nStarting the format from Windows wont care that mac has encryption on it.\nAfter the partition is destroyed mac should be able to format it again.\nAlternatively some Systems have disk utilities in the Bios. And you can use the manufacturers Low Level format utilities to erase the drive back to 0's. But Other than that. I think apple limits the format of encrypted mac drives. Likely to protect you from removing something that someone else encrypted. \"Perhaps there is a Special key you have to hold to enable the format\" If not, Perhaps there should be.\n\nA: You should be able to reformat this external drive with Disk Utility without any problems.\n", "Q: Have AirDrop auto-accept files from a certain other mac? I have two macs in separate rooms and like to use AirDrop to transfer files between them, but having to accept on the receiver every time I send a file is annoying.\nIs there a way to tell AirDrop always to accept files coming from a certain other Mac?\n\nA: TUAW just featured an app called DropCopy yesterday. It has been around for about 4 years and one of the first sentences I read popped out and reminded me of this question.\n\nFor one, DropCopy can auto-accept file transfers. Meaning, your recipient needn't be in front of his/her machine to initiate or accept a transfer. That's handy if you want some files to be waiting at a remote work station upon your arrival.\n\nIt's a bit of give-and-take. DropCopy DOES require all the computers to be on the same network. It does not set up a second channel AdHoc network even where supported, but it offers compatibility outside of Lion and lots of additional features.\n\nThe way it works is similar to AirDrop. Just drag-and-drop your file onto the Dropzone and it'll show all the possible destinations. Participating machines must be running DropCopy on the same network. Simple.\n\nVia TUAW's screenshot, DropCopy can also transfer your clipboard contents, send text messages, and also supports multiple computers.\nDropCopy is free for the first 3 computers, can be downloaded for free on the Mac App Store, purchased from 10base-t interactive's website, and even has an iOS version.\n\nA: As far as I've been able to tell, AirDrop is a 100% Finder/GUI driven interface. As evidenced by the fact that AirDrop does not enable unless you have the AirDrop Finder window open.\nI gotta say, DropBox is pretty drop dead simple to set up on multiple computers. Afterwards you can just throw a file onto a folder stack of your choice in order to sync it across computers.\nOne of the best features of DropBox in recent versions is direct LAN sync. Instead of uploading the file to DropBox's servers, and re-downloading it on the other computer, it does upload to DropBox, but locally sends it to the other computer at the same time provided they are on the same network in some wired or wireless fashion.\n\nA: AirDrop sole purpose is the fast and easy creation of an ad-hoc network to manually and securely exchange files between physically close computers (think about situations like classrooms, Starbucks etc.).\nIn your situation, why don't you just create a shared folder which can be accessed (over WiFi or LAN) from either Mac or use the Drop Boxes of the individual accounts?\n\nA: What about iChat and enabling Bonjour accounts?  I use that here for about 50ish 10.6.8 Macs and a handful of Windows 7 PCs running Pidgin.  \nStill no auto-accept, though, until you also install the abandonware extra Chax.\nA bit less than ideal, but works, and isn't restricted to OS X 10.7.\n", "Q: How to delete saved versions in Mac OS X Lion The new Versions feature in Lion stores old versions of the document I'm working on in case to revert back to some older version of the document.  However, how can I delete the version files for a given document?\nThere're hidden files in the /.DocumentRevisions-V100, but I'm afraid I cannot just simply delete that folder.\n\nA: If you want to delete old versions from a document directly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click besides the document name in the window title to access the version history\n\n*Time-machine like view opens, with document history on the right hand side\n\n*Clicking on the same menu as in step 1 in a history version will allow you to delete just this version\n\n*Option-Clicking will allow you to delete all history versions at once\n\n\nA: When you trash a document, the system cleans up all of the versions at the same time.\nI have been copying that document elsewhere (another drive), deleting the one with history, and then copying it back.\nAlso, from the app, if you have a Duplicate or Export option in the File menu, that will spawn off an unversioned copy that you can then save. \n\nIn practice, it's never been an issue since when I drag a file to export or upload, these Lion versions don't travel with the document - they only take up marginal space on my HD and help me with the history of each document.\n", "Q: Looking for an Evernote alternative with password lock I am looking for an Evernote alternative with the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cloud syncing\n\n*iPhone and iPad app\n\n*passcode lock (with encryption) - Yes, Evernote can encode notes, but only from the desktop client.

I'm having some serious issues finding a data collection program (Spreadsheets?) for use with my Dropbox account. The application should be able to export CSV files, and automatically upload them to a Dropbox account that I specify.\nDoes this app exist on the iTunes Store?\n\nA: I was able to complete this exact process using Tap Forms for iOS.\nOnce installed you can use an existing or newly created custom form to collect your data.  Once complete you can export the file.  The .csv will be available in the Export folder in the Files area.  From there you can select the .csv and Upload to Dropbox.  This will upload the .csv file to the root of your Dropbox.\nAdditionally you can open the .csv in Tap Forms and then use the share button (top right) to \"Open In...\", which will allow you to select the Dropbox app (assuming that you have it installed.  Once Dropbox launches, you will be presented with the Dropbox upload process, which allows you to select the upload folder in your Dropbox account.  You can also create a new folder as an upload destination.\nTap Forms also appears to support importing files from Dropbox as well.\n", "Q: Centrally Managed Apps/Home Folders on Mac OS X Lion Server I'm trying to allow access for multiple Mac clients with OS X Lion and user directories on a Lion server so users can login from any Mac in the network and access their profile.\nI also want to install/autoupdate software or put configs on all clients.\nI already took a look at patch management tools like munki but they don't seem to do what I'm looking for or their purpose/usage isn't clear.\nI would be glad if somebody could point me in the right direction.\n\nA: Well... You will need to run Open Directory, and set up network home folders within there.\nThen, when yous OD clients log into yous Macs, they will be given access to their home folder from the server.\nFor mobile users, you will want to set up a Mobile Home Folder, perhaps with HomeSync.\nCheck out these documents from Apple:\nhttps://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/10.7/\n\nFor your installing of software and configs, you will probably want to use Apple Remote Desktop\n\nA: There are different levels of ease with which you can approach this, perhaps taking training or hiring a consultant would be your best bet to help you make the best decision on how to proceed.  That being said, here's two ways to begin to accomplish what you're asking:\n\n\n*\n\n*Netbooting the computers from a centrally served image allows you to maintain the entire kit-n-caboodle, but is heaviest on the network and can be murky with software licensing. \n\n*Portable Home Directories are what TheWellington is speaking of, which requires more setup and services to be in place, and doesn't take care of Apps that can't work from a users home folder.  The process is: Once DNS, Open Directory and AFP are settled, you can bind workstations and clients can use the centrally managed credentials to access their home folder from any workstation.  You can manage configs like group policy on Windows with Managed Preferences in Workgroup Manager.  ARD can be helpful in reaching out to provide assistance for users as well, but it can't do everything well.\n\n\nIf neither of those take care of the entire picture, management suites like Casper and Absolute Manage(formerly LanRev) can do a good amount of what free, open source tools like Puppet(config state management) and Munki(patch management) could, depending on how far the above falls short of your goals.\n", "Q: How to log in with the native YouTube app? I created a new YouTube account to use functions like \"watch later\" on my iPhone4, my PC and my AppleTV2. But if I try to log in with this account on my iPhone and the native YouTube app, I always get the error message that the username and/or the password are wrong. I used as username the email address I used to create the YouTube/Google account and which I use to log in the web interface.\nWhat I'm missing? I'm sure that the credentials I use are correct.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I have a .mkv video with SSA/ASS subtitles & I want to convert it to .mp4 so I can watch it on my iPad. The video converts without errors but the subtitles are not there. How do I fix this?\n\nA: I know relatively easy and free way that I will share\n\n\n*\n\n*Subtitles have to be converted to SRT format. You may do that with Jubler.\n\n*Then I'm using Handbrake to convert to h.264 with soft subtitles. Here is the guide.\n\n*Alternatively you may use MKVTools to convert video without reencoding (in case it's already in h.264) to save time and after that add subtitles with Subler. You may try to import SSA subtitles (I don't have such on hand now to check if SSA will work with Subler so please report back if it will)\n\nA: Subler is a utility designed specifically for what you want to do. It will not only rewrap, and not transcode, the video to a friendly format, it will transcode the audio from ACC to AAC if necessary, and it will optimize the location of the mpeg-4 atom in the resulting file for iTunes friendly use. It uses a friendly drag and drop paradigm. Download Subler, unzip into your Applications folder and launch Subler. Type command-n to begin, and drag your mkv file into the window, and choose from the simple available options to accomplish precisely what you are asking to do. \nAlternatively, this bash script apparently uses ffmpeg, SublerCLI and HandbrakeCLI to batch rewrap, transcode or otherwise convert video files of various codecies and iTunes/iOS incompatible wrappers to iTunes/iOS friendly formats, automatically choosing a method that retains the best possible quality resultant file. It, however, doesn't, do subtitles, takes bit of reading and understanding the script to get it to install its dependencies, and will take a lot of time to complete processing if set upon a lot of HandBrake transcodes, and while doing so eventually eat up all your free memory in the process, but it is covenient once it is working and set in your $PATH, and nondestructively will place original files in your ~/.Trash so you can preview the resultant files before eliminating the originals.\n", "Q: Why can't Mail.app send email on Lion? My mail account (OS X Lion) refuses to send email. It receives mail fine and I have checked and rechecked all the settings etc. My iPhone and iPad send and receive mail with no problems, using the same settings, the same network, and the same accounts.\nAny ideas why this is happening?\n\nA: My grandmother's computer had the same issue. After trying a bunch of stuff, I ended up deleting the IMAP account and re-added it and everything works fine now.\nAs commented, you could also use the connection doctor (search for it in help if you can't find it under the menu structure for Mail) and see that all of the servers and passwords are set up correctly. Often an old setting can go stale or the preference file could get corrupt and need a new password to be stored for the sending side of email.\n\nA: Compare your outgoing server settings (SMTP, not IMAP) to those on your iOS devices. I'd imagine that's where your problems lies. Dig into the 'advanced' section and make sure you're using the correct authentication type, port, etc.\n\nA: I have the same problem, tried most of the suggestions, to no avail, still couldn't use Mail to send out. Downloaded Thunderbird, by Mozilla instead. Works a treat, same address, and has even hooked up with my address book, and to be honest looks a whole lot better.\n", "Q: What should I do with my original RAM after an upgrade? I just upgraded my 13\" MacBook Pro (mid-2009) from 2 GB of memory to 8 GB of RAM.

What will happen the next time I sync? If I out for a while and if I need some free space on my iPod, I can manually delete some videos (iTunesU) or some podcasts. Fine. \nBut what will happen the next time I sync ? \n\n\n*\n\n*Will those deleted podcasts be deleted in my library on my computer \n\n\nOR \n\n\n*\n\n*Will they be reloaded on my iPod ?\n\n\nA: If you play through the podcast before deleting it - iTunes on the iOS device will record that fact and sync this information to the main library even if you delete the episode before you connect to sync (over USB in iOS4).\nThe answer to your question depends more on how you have syncing set up. If the episode is still one that would be synced (after whatever play information transfers) - it will reappear again after the sync.\nWhether you listen to the episode or not, it won't get deleted on the main library simply because you deleted it from an iOS device. It may get deleted if you have that podcast set to auto delete once you have listened to older episodes, but that is because of the listening and the subsequent sync - not the deleting.\n", "Q: Is it possible to sort the user accounts in the login dialog? Is this possible to change the order of the different user accounts in the login dialog box ?\n\nA: This is a great question. A hack has not been created for this yet. The only temporary solution that I know of (I once wanted to do the same thing) is to add spaces to the beginning of a username to sort them (a single space will appear first, two spaces will appear second if I remember correctly).\nI would definitely love to see someone find the pref file where it organizes them in alphabetical order so that it can be hacked a bit, although I can imagine it wouldn't be the easiest thing to change and that someone would have to write some sort of script for it.\n", "Q: iTunes store / Books / Column browser If I go to the Books section of the iTunes store, I see the Column browser:\n\nIf i try to go back to the standard view (my Command+B or using the menu \"View\" -> \"Column Browser\" -> \"Hide Column Browser\" I am redirected to the main store page.

I used vmware article 1017838 to uninstall v3 manually, reboot, and then drag the Fusion 4 app to the Applications folder. Reboot and run Fusion. Same thing. Checked /var/run for vmware items. Checked Activity Monitor for vmware items. Rechecked locations specified in 1017838 and used spotlight to search around.\nI moved all my guests to an extra drive and unmounted that drive, and repeated the uninstall and reinstall.  A friend recommended an app called \"CleanApp\" to watch what files are created and modified during the installs, which did reveal a bit more cruft. Basically, I've tried to scrub my system of all things Fusion, both versions including guests, and then done a reinstall, and that hasn't worked. My last gasp was booting into the 32 bit kernel but that didn't help.\nI've filed a ticket with VMware, but it's been a slow slog.\n\nA: You can try with this command from a Terminal:\nVMware 3.x\n/Library/Application\\ Support/VMware\\ Fusion/vmrun list \nVMware 4.x\n/Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmrun list\nto see if you have any VMs runnig - if you do, then run this command:\nVMware 3.x\n/Library/Application\\ Support/VMware\\ Fusion/vmrun -T fusion stop \"/path/to/.vmx\" hard \nVMware 4.x\n/Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmrun -T fusion stop \"/path/to/.vmx\" hard\nwhere you replace \"/path/to/.vmx\" with your path to the VM still running.\n\nA: Fusion uses lock files to prevent multiple processes from modifying the same files at the same time, as could happen if you tried to run to copies of Fusion (say version 3 and version 4) at once.  When Fusion quits abnormally it leaves behind the lock files and you need to clean them up manually.\nSee this support article for how to check for running VMs and clean up Fusion lock files. If that doesn't solve it, do a Spotlight search including system files for files whose names end in .lck and if they look like they belong to Fusion, delete them.  You may find some lurking in your user home directory.\n\nA: As I recall, the .dmg that contains the vmware installer contained several items...  one was a drag & drop VMware install.  You know the kind, drag to applications and be done.\nOne of the other items, that I had to scroll to find (love the invisible scrollbars in Lion) was an installer .pkg file that simultaneously uninstalled Fusion 3, and installed Fusion 4.  I don't recall what it was called.  Have you tried this .pkg?\nI ask because you refer to two steps, and I distinctly recall only one step to do the upgrade.  I ran the .pkg and Fusion 3 was removed and 4 was installed.  I didn't need to take any additional steps.\nIt may be too late to try that method now, with all that you have done to remove Fusion 3...   but give it a try.\n", "Q: Delete songs manually on ipod Touch (without the help of iTunes) Is it possible to delete songs manually on an iPod Touch (without the help of iTunes) as it is possible for podcasts and videocasts?\n\nA: Not in the current iOS version\n", "Q: How to disable single-user boot (command S) By default, Macs are extremely insecure if somebody can get physical access, as they can simply shut it down, press the power button, hold command-S, and there, they get root access in 5 seconds.\nIs there a way to disable the single-user boot mode, or at least password-protect it?\n\nA: With complete physical access, all bets are off regarding security of booting.  Make sure that the data or user accounts that you care about are encrypted (filevault, et.al.) so that the bits on the disk are more likely useless without a password.\n\nA: The best you can do is set a firmware password in hopes that someone won't change the boot options stored in NVRAM or let the keyboard select an alternate software to boot and bypass your administrative passwords.\nOlder macs use Open Firmware to enforce this password, newer ones use EFI Password to prevent booting into single user mode.\nPhysical access means with tools, your mac is vulnerable to physically reset the firmware password or remove the drive. To protect there, consider FileVault which encrypts the contents of your disk and requires the correct password regardless of physical access to the mac.\n", "Q: Magic trackpad pairing issues with Lion The Question\nHow can I unpair the trackpad as a mouse and pair it using trackpad option instead?  \nBackground \nI made the mistake of pairing the Magic trackpad via System->Bluetooth->Bluetooth Setup Assistant.  By doing this the only thing I can use the trackpad for is pointing an left clicking.  I now see that it can be paired via the System->Trackpad->Set Up Bluetooth Trackpad... option.\nWhat I have tried \nInside Bluetooth settings: Disconnected the device, then using the - button removed it.  Then powered down the trackpad and restarted the pairing process by holding the power button.  \nWhile the green led is flashing, I go to the Trackpad set up and find the device.  However it keeps failing when connecting to the trackpad.  I did notice that it fails immediately  after seeing the \"Connected\" message displayed on my screen.  At this point I can use the trackpad as a pointing device, but am unable to connect to it using the trackpad set up.  \nSystem Settings\nOS X Lion\nUsing USB Overdrive (for a wired logitech mouse)\nUPDATE\nFollowing the advice of a comment, I used the XCode's Bluetooth Manger and reset every possible device.  The issue still persists.  \nTo find the Bluetooth Manger (assuming you have XCode installed and using Finder): Browse to MacHD/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Bluetooth \n\nA: Turns out it was USB Overdrive.  Running 3.1 still causes issues with Lion.\nWhen Overdrive is installed it only sees the trackpad as a mouse.  I uninstalled USB Overdrive and Lion detected it after reboot with no trouble at all.\nThis link was quite helpful as well.\n\nA: Did you unpair by going to System Preferences... ->   Trackpad -> Set Up Bluetooth Trackpad...\nThen select the trackpad and choose Unpair\nThis is different to just removing it from the list of Bluetooth devices.\nYou will then be able to pair it again properly.\n\n", "Q: Stylus for Multitouch (Laptop) Trackpad?

It will probably be necessary to upgrade at some point, but until then I want to stay with the commercial free version.\nIs there any way I can prevent it ever being updated? I want to ensure that it will not be updated by accident.\n\nA: Back up your iPad with iTunes. Back up that hard drive. Unplug that backup and store it far away from any internet connection. If you do update Sykpe by mistake, restore the iPad from the backup. It won't keep Skype from updating, but it will preserve your ability to undo the update.\n\nA: Just drag the Skype icon from iTunes to your desktop (or every other location for that matter) and you are all set.\nNext time you get an update simply drag Skype from your desktop back into iTunes and you will have the original version again.\nBut for your original question: no it is not possible to prevent updates if you clicked the 'download all updates' button\n", "Q: What is the correct usage of working folders and bookmarks in Versions (Subversion Client) for local repositories? I have been using Versions, the popular Subversion client for OS X, to connect to remote Subversion repositories. These remote repositories you keep as bookmarks on the left side bar. However, when it comes to local repositories, I have to admit I am still a bit clueless. I see Versions has in addition to bookmarks, the concept of working folders. I am unsure if working folders are meant to be used separate of bookmarks or if working folders are meant to be placed inside bookmarks. What is the correct way to set up and check out a local repository?\nIs the local repository folder A meant to stay separate from the folder B containing the files I want to keep under version control? Can folder B be a subfolder of A? Also, as far as how it works internally: Where are the past versions of files kept in the file system? \nI created a local repository using Versions and I saw on my file system that many Subversion system files and folders were created on the local repository folder. Nowhere did I see the usual \"branches\", \"tags\" and \"trunk\" that I usually find on remote repositories that have already been created. Are those created by hand?\nSome clarification on the barebones basics of local repositories would be appreciated. I am hoping to find out the correct workflow from set up to starting with my first check out. Thanks. \n\nA: I have used Versions, but I prefer Cornerstone 2.  It is a much more robust client.\nA repository is a folder stored on a computer (local or remote.)  It contains all the data regarding the version control of a set of files, stored in a data structure that most people don't need to understand.\nA working folder is a folder on your local system that contains a copy of the files that are stored in the crazy data structure that is the repository.\nSo, if you have a local repository, that folder is stored on your hard drive.  You should never need to access this from the Finder or the Terminal, or well, through any means whatsoever other that through your SVN client (Versions).\nIn order to work with the files stored in that local repository, use Versions to \"Check Out\" a working copy of the files.  These files will go into a second folder somewhere on your filesystem.  These files you can access directly using whatever application floats your boat.  After making changes to the files, you go back to Versions and check the files into the repository.  This action creates a second version of the files within the crazy data structure that is your repository.\nUsing Versions, you can then move back and forth through these various versions of your files.   Whatever version you want to work form is then loaded into your working copy or you can check out a second working copy if you want to work with a different version of the files, while keeping your current working directory as well.\n\nHere is how I arrange my SVN repositories and working directories.\nFirst:  The repositories are all stored in ~/svnroot.  I have a couple of types of projects that I use SVN for, so the structure looks like this.\n~/svnroot/scripts/project1\n~/svnroot/scripts/project2\n~/svnroot/documentation/project3\netc etc etc\n\nKeep in mind that in each example above, the last part of the path above is the actual repository.\nSecond: Then I create working copies of these repositories.   I keep those in the same structure in my home directory.  It looks like this.\n~/scripts/project1\n~/scripts/project2\n~/documentation/project3\netc etc etc    \n\nNote the absence of the svnroot directory in these examples... Also, keep in mind that the last part of the path above is the directory that is under version control, otherwise referred to as the Working Copy.  These are the files you can edit to your heart's content.\nThen, to keep things organized, I create the scripts and documentation directories in the sidebar of Versions and put the entries for the working directories and repositories in here.\nI will try to remember to provide a screenshot when I get home tonight.\nThird:  Now, put the files you want under version control into the Working Copy folders in the Finder.   Back to Versions and check the files into the repository.  Now you are all set and should be able to work.\n\nVersions does not generate tags, branches, and trunks.  If you want to use them in your project, create each folder in the Working Copy, and then check them into the repository.  In order to create a tag or a branch, you will want to check the Versions website.  Their help documentation covers that item... and it needs to be done in the repository view, not the working copy view.\nhttp://versionsapp.com/support\nOh, and \"Bookmarks\" is just the term that Versions uses to keep track of your repositories and working copies in the sidebar of the main window. \n\nA: I've been using Versions for a couple of years, but never paid attention to the idea of \"bookmarks\" -- even though I've used it for both local repositories and remote repositories with local working copies.  So, I looked it up.\nIt looks like \"bookmarks\" is just the Versions.app list of content you've connected to, whether it's a remote svn resource for browsing, or a local copy of something you're working on remotely.  There are some tips & tricks to how you set Versions to link & organize what you're working with, and you can look that up in the help (Help > Versions Help > Versions Workflow > Bookmarks).\nSo, the rest of the answer to your question is standard svn advice, and what @TheWellington wrote here looks right on that topic.  \"Working folders\" are local copies of some aspect of your remote repository.  Typically the code lives on a remote server, or in a \"local repository\" somewhere else on your disk that you don't touch directly.  You make a \"working folder\" when you want to actually make changes.  This can be tied to the \"trunk\", or a \"branch\" of the project.  I suggest reading the SVN book for \"best practices\" tied to these -- you could start with these links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Version Control Basics\n\n*Creating a Working Copy\n\n*Using Branches\nAs @VxJasonxV noted, it's up to you to create the standard svn directory structure (trunk, tags, branches) by hand, and it's good advice to do so.  That makes it much easier to go back in time, explore alternate paths, and know exactly what code/data is associated with a particular thing you've released into the wild.\nFinally, to be clear, you should never interact with the \"local repository\" files on disk directly.  Treat it as very cryptic black box (which it is), and use the svn client (Versions.app or command line) to access your data, examine history, etc.\n", "Q: MacBook Air dual boot Lion+10.6 Can a 2010 MacBook Air internal SSD be configured for the dual-boot of both Lion/10.7.x and Snow Leopard/10.6.x?  If so, how much extra storage space is required for 2 boot partitions vs. one?  Other than storage space, are there any downsides of doing this?  For example, will the (re)boot speed get noticeably slower?\n\nA: Yes - it's trivial to partition and takes a negligible amount of space away from the drive for the second partition's overhead.\nSince that model is supported on Snow Leopard - the installer will run happily to install to any partition that's larger than 6G.\nSince the mac stores the default boot volume in NVRAM - there's really no delay in booting unless you hold the option key to get the boot manager and ignore the stored default.\nLion and BootCamp can be a little fussy, but most times you can just resize your current OS to make room for the new one, make a new partition and run the installer.\nWindows doesn't like more than 3 partitions on the drive and the BootCamp assistant doesn't want to deal with two mac partitions, so you have to know enough about Disk Utility to do that setup by hand. For SL + Lion - you'll end up with two large partitions and a small Recovery HD at the end of the drive\nHere's what one of my macs with a copy of Lion and Lion server looks like. You'll have one less Recovery HD with Snow Leopard.\nmac:~ mike$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *160.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS mac                     94.3 GB    disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS server                  64.2 GB    disk0s4\n   5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5\n\n", "Q: In Numbers, how can I determine the default formatting of cells in rows that have just been added to a sheet? When using Numbers, I have noticed that whenever I add a new row above existing rows, all of the formatting for the new row is exactly like the rows below it. However, if I add a new row below existing rows, the formatting is reverted to the default formatting for a brand new sheet. There are other inconsistencies around the choices that Numbers makes when determining the formatting of new cells and rows, but this is the one that I find to be more consistent. \nIs there a way to set up a default formatting (font name and size) for all new cells and rows? Something like the default templates in Microsoft Office. Any pointers will be appreciated. Thanks. \n\nA: I found the following tutorial at Apple that has the answer to my own question: The default table styles are always taken from the table style list that you choose from the panel on the bottom-left corner of the screen. \nThe solution to my problem is to use the Create New Table Style command under the Format menu and adding a brand new table style. As long as this new style remains selected, it is the one that the table will keep as a whole. \nI have tried this at home and it works as advertised. \n", "Q: How to add your university timetable to iCal? Is there a common way to add institutional scheduling information (such as an individual's university course schedule or timetable) to iCal? In what format would it have to be published to be importable into iCal?\nIn other words, would it be possible for iCal to know what times during the day your availability is set to 'Busy' so that it warns you when creating appointments during those times?\n\nA: Some schools provide CalDAV links or iCal subscriptions for their events calendars.   Often this will show up as an RSS feed link somewhere on the page that contains the calendar.\nYou may need to ask this question of the Technology Department folks or whomever manages the events calendar.\nAlso, if you need to provide access credentials in order to get to the calendar, expect to run into some problems. iCal doesn't know how to do this.\n", "Q: Disk utility on Mac and free space dispatching I have a physical hard drive that is split into 3 partitions. The second partition is running out of space and I want to give it some free space that I have on the third partition. While, this is simple to achieve on Windows, I just can't get there with my Mac.\nThe problem is that I can create a new partition from the free space but not transfer space from my third to my second partition. This is a common task and I can't believe Disk Utility can't do that so I ask you what I should do in order to achieve this?\n\nA: I would say that this is not a common task: it's actually quite complex.\nThe issue is that partitions are filled up from beginning to end, so the free space in your third partition is at the end of it, so it's not adjacent to your second partition.\nWhat you need to do is to move the data from the third partition to another hard drive (or back up your entire disk to another, which would be preferred). Once that's done, delete the third partition in Disk Utility. Expand the second partition into this free space (leaving enough room for the third partition) and re-add the third partition. Finally, copy the files back to the third partition from the copy made in the first step.\n", "Q: How can I diagnose hardware issues on my MacBook Pro 13\" (mid 2010)? I have hit some evil kind of problem with my MacBook Pro 13\" (mid 2010). The backstory is as follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*I bought the MBP in January. \n\n*Felt 4 GB of RAM memory wasn't enough, so in June, I upgraded to 8 GB.\n\n*From here it went downhill.\n\n\nAfter a week may be of using the new RAM (2x4 GB memory modules, purchased through Apple authorized service) I began experiencing some strange behaviors in OS X Snow Leopard (10.6.8). At first it wasn't very often, but Google Chrome seemed to crash quite a lot more than before (crashed tabs, nothing more serious though). \nThen Lion came out and I upgraded immediately, hoping that it was a software bug. I did an upgrade over SL, not a clean install. The result was just terrible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tons of crashes on Google Chrome (and by tons I mean that I had stretches of time that almost every click inside the browser resulted an instant crash).\n\n*Other applications quitting unexpectedly. This includes everything I use - Skype, Mail, Finder, games, etc. The error was ACC_BAD_ACCESS or something like this (will correct it when I hit it again, can't remember the exact message). \n\n*Kernel panics almost after every wake up of the notebook (after I put it to sleep in the evening).\n\n*Strange Finder/WindowManager crashes, where I cannot manage any window. Cannot use any application. I can click and switch windows, but I cannot type anything in them. When switching windows, the active application in the Toolbar (the bar where the menu is) doesn't change. E.g. it crashes while using Chrome, then I can switch to Skype, Terminal, TextEdit (if I have started them already), but I cannot type anything in them. This means that I cannot even reboot the machine through the command line. During this, I can press the power button and the Power menu comes up. I choose Restart or Shut down and sometimes the machine seemingly goes to restart/shutdown, goes to the grey screen, but instead of shutting down/restarting, it brings me back to the login screen, like when I do logout/login. \n\n\nAlso I began experiencing strange graphical glitches, which are very strange here is a link to a gallery of screenshots ( blacked out things are private stuff, not part of the bug :)) \n\n\n*\n\n*The first two images are what I encounter the most - red or yellow artifacts on the screen. \n\n*The third one is a bit different. The artifacts are showing my desktop image. \n\n*They appear on random occasions, mostly in Chrome, because I use it most of the time, but I have encountered this in other apps too (skype, MS Word, Pages..).\n\n*The bug appears to be some kind of a rendering bug, I believe before the Video card, because I am able to do a screenshot of it ( cmd shift 3 )\n\n*I can move my mouse over the glitchy area and it remains glitchy\n\n*If I force it to re-render the area by some means: moving the window, dragging something else over it (e.g. screenshot with cmd+shift+4 to select an area)\n\n\nI believed that all this was caused by the RAM upgrade, so I went ballistic on the MBP and ran all kinds of memtests I could find. The results were not very encouraging:\n\n\n*\n\n*memtest86 found an error on the 2nd pass only\n\n*memtest (the tool which you start in single user) found errors in XOR-ing the memory every time I started it (can't find the exact logs)\n\n*Apple test - no problem found, everything is perfect, birds are singing, the grass is green, etc.\n\n\nI sent it to repair in the Apple authorized service here. Made sure they knew everything I experienced and most of all that they should test the memory modules to see if there is a problem with them. After a week there, they returned it to me and said that there was no problem with the memory at all. They have been testing it intensively for the whole week and no memory errors or something were found. \nAfter I got home, I just formatted it and made a clean Lion install. \nThis fixed quite a lot of the problems and it was perfect for the first two days. Then some of the symptoms started coming back, but in a very light form - some random crashes, once or twice a day may be, may be less. The graphical bugs once or twice a day, kernel panic once a week.\nBut here comes the interesting part - After using it for about a month after that, I started encountering the problems more often than I want to. Also I began experiencing something more fun with the external monitors I use. First one day when I went to the office, I plugged the MBP in and connected the external video connector (miniDP-DVI) and BAM, instead of a normal Login screen I see COLOR NOISE, like when there is no signal on an analog TV set. Then it started doing this most of the times when the screen locked and the screen went dark. This is easily fixable through the monitor by changing the source from DVI to VGA and back (don't know how this is related to the above problems, but it happens now and I am not sure if it is a symptom or just bad miniDP-DVI connector). I believed it was a problem with that single monitor, but it started doing it at home too, where I hadn't had this problem a single time before the last week ( same setup - miniDP-DVI).\nI still believe the problem has to do something with either RAM or motherboard/video card, but I don't know how to prove it to the repair service fellas, so they can change it. \nToday my bootcamp Windows 7 also started acting weird and crashing all the apps with c00000005 (Bad memory access, access violation, just like the symptom I mentioned above). It started out of nothing, while browsing with IE, because I was too lazy to install FF/Chrome. It started killing my tabs on every page I opened and contained some javascript on it. Then Skype went down and so on. \nTL;DR; My MBP started experiencing strange behavior after upgrading RAM.\nSo now to the question itself - What tools I can use to diagnose the problem? What is the most reliable way to test RAM, Mainboard, Video Card (GPU) ? What do you suggest?\nEDIT/UPDATE:\nSince there were few questions sent directly to me, I believe it is better to add some more information on the solution of the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*The main problem with crashing and unstable programs was, in fact, caused by bad memory module. After two reinstalls of the OS, clearing firmware settings, etc., I finally managed to persuade the local Apple authorized service to replace the RAM modules which they installed during my first upgrade to 8GB of RAM. The stability problems vanished that very moment. \n\n*The graphic problems, though seems to persist. What I have found out for now is that they are caused by some problems in the video drivers for my specific model. After updating to 10.8 the problems still happens from time to time but instead of getting bright yellow or red, I just see fuzziness in some static places while working, but it is very rare occurrence. So your mileage on this may vary for you, but if possible, upgrade to the latest OS or apply all the updates available. It may fix some of the graphic problems. The interesting part is that I have seen this problem on other MBPros from different years and all of them showed different ways of breaking the image. \n\n\nA: Your trip the Genius bar was too focused in my opinion. I suggest you make another appointment and lay out your case above, but this time, don't mention the memory tests, but that the problems showed up when you upgraded the RAM. Refer them to your old case number (tack this visit on as a follow-up).\nTell the Genius on hand that the problems still exist and that they need to do further testing. As it stands, your Mac is unusable. Additionally, tell them to make note that you have tried a fresh re-installation and it did nothing to help (don't mention that things ran fine for a day or too, stick to the current state of the system), which will rule out any software problems.\nAsk them on what they suggest and follow it (no matter how annoying it may be). If it doesn't fix it, call them and do another follow-up. If they tested the RAM and it passes, then it might be the logicboard.\nIn any case, do not visit them with \"the solution.\" Let them find it through there own testing. Clearly, the logs containing kernel panics and all the problems you list will support your case. Moreover, their internal testing tools are much more sophisticated than what you'll scrounge up on the net through 3rd party apps (they actually have in-house diagnostic utilities for these occasions).\nI would highly recommend that you stop spending your time diagnosing the problem and let them do it for you. That's what they're there for.\nIf after everything is said and done, and they still can't pinpoint a problem, you will likely walk away with a new Mac. Just focus on the problems you are suffering from and leave the diagnostics to the Geniuses and technicians.\nYou may want to downgrade back to the 4 GB for now. And it's of note that replacing the RAM and the hard drive yourself do not void your warranty for that particular Mac model.\nPS: You don't specify if you took your notebook to an Apple Store and spoke with a Genius or some Apple authorized repair centre. I would strongly encourage you to deal with Apple directly. They'll not only treat you better, but likely solve the problem with less headache. My advice is tailored to them; you are totally on your own should you choose a 3rd party repair shop. To galvanize the need to deal with Apple, let me put forth the following. I had a friend who purchased a Mac mini. There were strange problems during boot up where it would occasionally load the keyboard set-up assistant. The machine was also sluggish and exhibited other unusual anomalies in its day to day. We took it into an Apple Store and the Genius tried to reproduce the errors. He couldn't. He also expressly stated that minis never required repair or servicing. But with all that, he elected to replace the entire unit and gave my friend a new mini. Took it back to his place and it hummed, no more issues. I doubt he would have received the same treatment from a computer store authorized to service Macs. Deal with Apple direct; I cannot stress that enough.\n", "Q: Why are my maximize and minimize buttons grey? I have had my MacBook for a couple of months now, and the minimize and maximize buttons are all grey. They weren't like that when I got it. Does anyone know how to get the colors back?\n\nA: In System Preferences, there is a setting for overall \"Appearance.\" It would appear that your appearance has been set to \"Graphite\" instead of the default \"blue.\" While the maximize and minimize buttons are not blue, when the appearance is set to blue, they are in color; when the appearance is set to graphite, they are grey.\n\n", "Q: Are there advanced performance profiling tools (ideally, with a graphical interface) aside from DTrace? Simply put, I'm looking for a utility akin to Windows NT's Performance Monitor (perfmon.exe).  The ability to specify which metrics I want to track (ex. reads/sec, writes/sec) for a given object (ex. Macintosh HD), and ideally, for all or specific processes.\nThe use case is we have a developer at the office whose MacBook has abominable disk performance.  I/O is bad enough to the point where it may be blocking.  It's evident from Activity Monitor that there's an average of 80-110 IOps, but at this point it'd be advantageous to pin down what the offending processes might be (it's certainly not mds or mdworker).  Although using DTrace scripts such as IOSnoop would probably work, a graphical tool (including non-free) that would provide easier visibility into these (and other) metrics would certainly be preferred.\n\nA: XCode 4's Instruments is certainly a viable choice that looks as if it'll get the job done. -- you can profile specific processes/agents/daemons and change the active target during the session.  However, developer tools are not a common install on most computers (and it's a large download).\n", "Q: How to forward port 80 to run a server So I turned on Web Sharing on my mac and put a basic HTML file in the folder for it, but I want to know how to make it accessible from any computer. How would I do that?\n\nA: It already is on your local network.  You need to know either the IP address of your Mac or name of your Mac.  You can get the name of your Mac by clicking the Sharing option in System Preferences.  It'll be at the top.  You can simplify the name to make it easier for others.  For example, if you name your Mac AppleServer then everyone on the network should be able to find it at AppleServer.local.\nIf you want it accessible from anywhere in the world it is much more involved.  Start by figuring out what the IP address is of your Mac and on your broadband router either set your Mac has the machine in the DMZ or setup a port forward for port 80 to the IP of your Mac.  Your router's manual should describe how to do this.\nIn case your Internet Access Provider gives you a dynamic IP you may also want to check out services like DynDNS so your external users don't have to ask you for your current IP address every time.\n", "Q: Safari with OS X 10 6.8 will not open PDF files After installing the OS X 10.6.8 update on my iMac (10,1), when PDF files are opened within Safari, a blue circle appears, then a black screen with the first page of the PDF file. It will not open further or download.\nI also downloaded the update on our older iMac (7,1) and the same thing happened.  After visiting the Apple Store today, it was suggested that we reinstall Safari, which we did on both computers.  This did not change the situation.\nWe also have a third computer, a laptop that has not been updated to 10.6.8. This computer has no problem.  Any ideas?\n\nA: Run the installer for Snow Leopard over your current installation.  The issue is in your settings.  The easiest way to make this work is to let the installer reinstall.  Most likely you restored both machines from a time machine backup at some point and the setting was incorrect and never got fixed.  Easy fix though. \n\nA: Are you sure it is not just in non-continuous-scrolling mode?

They do however have ethernet points in each room.  I will only be taking my iPhone with me on this trip which obviously doesn't have an ethernet port.  However I do have a Netgear DG834PN modem-router which I can take with me.\nI had a thought that I could put the router in bridged mode and use it as a wireless access point so that my iPhone can utilise the ethernet network.  Does this sound correct?  If I understand bridging correctly, this will mean that I won't need to assign an IP address to my router as it will take the one handed out by the DHCP server in the hotel.\nIs any of this at all correct?  If not, do I have any options or am I stuck?\n\nA: Yes, this could work. It's an odd solution, but allowing your router to be a bridge, then presenting a wireless SSID to your iPhone is a way to make this work. Perhaps the hotel assumed guests would bring laptop computers, thus the hard-wired ethernet ports... \n\nA: before you go, write down the MAC address of a PC. Tell your router to display the MAC address of the PC on the WAN port. Some Hotels do check and disallow the MAC of home routers.\notherwise this is a good idea.\n\nA: Ignore the WAN port altogether and connect your in-room Ethernet to one of the LAN ports. Be sure to disable DHCP on the LAN side so that your router doesn't attempt to provide invalid addresses to your devices, or to other guests.\nNo need for any complicated modes. Any home wireless router can be used this way. In fact, that's how I set up my wireless, since I use a separate dedicated router.\n", "Q: Can you triple boot on Mac OS X Lion (twice) and Linux? I'd like to install two separate version of OS X Lion and a copy of Linux on my Mac.\nHow do I go about doing this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Disk Utility & select the drive you want to install your OS on.\n\n*Open the Partitions tab & add 2 partitions by clicking on the\nlittle \"+\", then arrange the partition size as required\n\n*Make sure to name your partitions so not to get mixed up later\n\n*Click apply and wait for your partitions to get created.\n\n\nFor Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the installer & when it asks which disk you want to install; choose show all disks & pick the one you want\n\n\nFor Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*You probably have a bootable disk to install ubuntu.

I am using a shared hosting for my site where I am going to create all the email ID's. I will configure these ID's in default Mail.app. Now whenever my team send emails to clients I want it to CC to my email ID automatically. \n\nA: If you switch your team over to Google apps, the Gmail web client lets you automatically cc or bcc every email, this is how I automated emails.\n\nA: Have a look at MailActOn.

But this is very annoying: I have to click away the pop up (and sometimes multiple pop ups because I read multiple email accounts).\nIs there any way to prevent this pop up? (It's only valid for a few moments...)\n\nA: No. The popups occur because to receice mail, you will require an Internet connection (be it cellular or wifi). Without a connection, Mail cannot pull any emails from the server (hence the notice).\nThe popups are hardcoded into to the app and there is currently no option to supress them. \nSo you have two choices: a) you can wait for your phone to negotiate a connection with your carrier or wireless network and then open Mail, or b) click through the prompts as you currently do. I'd choose the former (a) because even if you don't wait (perhaps want to read old mail), you'll not only have to bypass the prompt asking you to enable a connection, but also the prompts that tell you a connection to the mail server could not be established. \nAs much as it's likely not the solution you were hoping for, it does make some sense as Mail is generally of little use without an Internet connection (except for those rare moments when you need to reference an old email).\nA Popup Blocker does exist in the halls of Cydia (requires jailbreak), but fails to mention if it handles those specific Mail warnings (it might be located under the Data Network errors listing).\n\n", "Q: Will it damage my iPad if I use an iPhone charger to charge it? I have the opposite issue of this question: Is it OK to charge my iPhone with my iPad charger?\nI want to use my iPhone charger (plugged directly into main electricity) to charge my iPad. I've noticed that the charger gets quite warm when charging the iPad (not iPhone).\nIs it unsafe to charge the iPad via the iPhone 5W charger?\n\nA: No \nI mix and match my chargers often, the only disadvantage is that the iPhone charger charges slower according to a lot of sources, but I have yet to experience it. I still have an iPhone 3G charger I use as a spare at work to charge my iPad on occasion.\nInterestingly I have never noticed my chargers getting hot either, but will admit I have never actively looked.\nLooking at the Charging Tips here the reason for the slower charge is that the iPhone charger is 5W compared to 10W for the iPad, based on wattage alone, I can't see how you would damage the iPad, I would suspect using a higher wattage might however.\n\nA: Any charger circuit has inner impedence,the wattage bigger,the inner impedence\nWill be smaller,the voltage drop while charging also smaller,the result is a charging time litter bit longer.On other side,the inner impedence contain resistance,it cause the charger warm ( temperature rise),so if you use the 5w\nCharger to charge an iPad,you can feel the adapter warmer than used on iPhone\n.

I would like to rip a DVD on to Mac then onto a multimedia device to play them on my TV set.\nIs there a software that will help me to do so?\n\nA: I absolutely agree that Handbrake is a great tool to use.\nHowever, I got Ripit in one of the Mac software bundles, and it's a great program too, especially if you want something that will:\n\n\n*\n\n*automatically start running as soon as you insert a DVD (and eject when it's done, if you want)\n\n*not only rip the DVD but also pull out individual episodes from a DVD of a TV show, etc.\nGenerally I use RipIt to make VIDEO_TS folders out of DVDs and then use Handbrake to convert the Video_TS files into video files. The nice thing about that setup is that I can rip a bunch of DVDs, and then set the Handbrake queue to process the VIDEO_TS files, and just leave the computer to run unattended until it has finished.\nRipIt is $25, which will be a deal-breaker for some, especially when HandBrake is free, but if you've purchased Mac bundles in the past, you might already have a license code for it.\n\nA: You can use HandBrake. \n\nHandBrake is an open-source, GPL-licensed, multiplatform, multithreaded video transcoder, available for MacOS X, Linux and Windows.\n\nThere are a lot of built-in preset  you can chose from to rip your DVD to a format you'll be able to play on your multimedia device.\n\nA: I use ripIt mainly because it's so easy to use (I also tried handbrake). it cost 25$ but you can rip 10 DVDs for free to try it...\n\nA: Just use itunes movies and burn to disk... DVD-R's are pretty cheap, then just convert it on videora (free) or if you have a ps3, just stick it on a USB stick\n\nA: My vote goes to Handbrake for ripping, but you could also use Disk Utility to simply make an ISO of the DVD.\n", "Q: How to reduce lag when scrolling in Preview? I have a large pdf file and I was wondering how I could decrease the lag when scrolling. \nI tried breaking the file into smaller sections (roughly 20 page chunks) but that didn't help. I'm thinking scrolling is so slow because each page is some sort of image.\nAre there any other steps I can take to reduce the choppiness when scrolling?\n\nA: How is the PDF compressed? If it is black and white only, it may be using a compression method that leads to choppy behaviour.\nI was recently dealing with a product manual that was a black and white only scan. It was compressed using JBIG2, and it stuttered enormously when scrolling, even on a top-of-the-line MacBook.\nI opened the document in Adobe Acrobat, and recompressed it using ZIP, and the scrolling problem went away entirely.\nIf you have Acrobat Pro, the steps I took were: Open the file -> Save As -> \"Optimised PDF\" -> Change the \"Monochrome Images\" compression dropdown to \"ZIP\" -> Ok.\nIt does increase the size of the file (from 1.2 MB to 3 MB), but I can actually skim the document now.\nI think it mostly boils down to the fact that JBIG2 is compute-intensive, and Most PDF applications don't render the document much ahead of the current page.\n\nIf you don't have Acrobat, and you can post the PDF, I can take a look at it for you.\n\nA: What are the specifications of your Mac? If you have very little RAM, that might impact your system speed overall.\nUPDATE\nAccording to your screen shot, this is a mid-2010 MacBook Pro with 4GB RAM. This is a fast computer with sufficient RAM for this task, so this is not the problem.\n\nA: Using an alternate PDF viewer, eg. Skim, might improve performance.\n\nA: Adobe's Acrobat Reader DC is significantly faster at opening and displaying some 1500+, 250 MB+, vector graphics-heavy files than preview. While Preview requires about 20 seconds to load it's more or less instantaneous in Acrobat Reader.\n\nA: More info to share besides @Fake Name's answer:\nAfter exploring all the pdfs I have that suffer from stuttering in scrolling, they are all old PDFs (I guess, generated by latex in the process ps->pdf), which uses Postscript font types (e.g. Type3). And the fonts are shown blurry in Preview.app. (No matter how small the PDFs are, e.g. <10k. However, if you only have a few pages, say 3 pages, the scrolling stutters only the first time you reach that page or during a few seconds after opening the file.)\nThe Preview.app on Yosemite fails to deal with these fonts appropriately (rendering, smoothing). When opening them, any scrolling on the pages firstly visited will show stuttering, lags (not slightly, quite obvious and serious). \nAlternative \"Solution\" (alleviating scrolling lags): in Preview.app, \"Preferences\" -> \"PDF\" tab -> uncheck \"smooth text and line art\". Then you will see significance improvement of scrolling performance. However, fonts are still shown blurry if not zooming in. One word, these fonts are no longer well supported after Yosemite. (Note that disable smoothing will give you really bad font rendering in other normal PDFs).\nIf I remember correctly, the old versions of OS X didn't have this problem; maybe certain functionalities of Preview.app have been removed, since new LaTeX typesetting systems no longer use these fonts any more (while you can still configure it and to use them). No idea why Apple meant to produce these troubles.\n\nA: \"Print to pdf\" then open result in Preview again.

I can then add that FAT32 partition as Shared Network folder and access its data.\nThe following is the partition structure I would like to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacOS = 100GB \n\n*VmWare Fusion Win7 = 120GB \n\n*myStuff Partition = 280GB (which is Fat32 or exFat)\n\n\nI want to access myStuff partition via OSX as well as VMWare Fusion.\n\nA: Is it possible? Yes\nBased on your comment, why?\nVMWare Fusion runs Windows 7 virtually. Therefore you don't need a partition for it, the OS will simply be installed in a Virtual File on your current HDD, which will grow based on how much space it is using up to the maximum set when you created the virtual machine. Fusion only allows you to use a partition if your using Bootcamp to run Windows already.\nFurthermore, Fusion allows you to share folders on your OSX drive with the Virtual Machine directly, without needing to format a partition beforehand, and can also write to your OSX drive natively. \nRemember, you are basically running both operating systems at the same time, and Fusion, like Parallels, completely integrates and shares between the 2 operating sysems seamlessly.\nWhat you are referring to in your question is dual booting using Bootcamp, where you can only access one operating system at a time, and no sharing is done.\n", "Q: How to create a spotlight search for all files inside a folder? In Lion, you have All My Files to search everything in your home folder. However, when you activate finder's spotlight, via command + F you can start searching only by first typing something.\nHow can I search for everything in one particular folder (say, external HDD) without specifying a search token?\n\nA: After some more research, it reminds me that finder's spotlight had boolean UI since OS X 10.5. You can filter for \"not a folder\"  for All My Files experience, or with a little bit more filter  for \"all files\".\nIt feels a bit hack-y though.\n\nA: You can create a saved search similar to \"All My Files\" but only searching a specific folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the folder you want to search\n\n*Enter -kind:folder into the search field\n\n*At the top of the window make sure to choose to search only the folder you're in.

E.g. should I always keep it charged, or always let the battery run to 0% before recharging?\nNote: not the same as How can I make my iPad's battery last longer? which is about battery life during use.\nUpdate: this question looks very much like: What is the best way to recharge an iPod Touch battery? (sorry, only found after posting this). This is slightly more general but perhaps is a duplicate?\n\nA: According to Apple's website:\n\nUse Your iPad Regularly\nFor proper reporting of the battery’s state of charge, be sure to go through at least one charge cycle per month (charging the battery to 100% and then completely running it down).\n\n", "Q: Viewing the HDD activity of active processes The Activity Monitor allows users of Lion to inspect the CPU usage, used memory and some other things for each running process.

I'm developing a lot of Java software with Eclipse. My MacBook running Snow Leopard 10.6.8 with 4GB RAM and Core 2 Duo is very slow.\nWould it help to use an SSD and upgrade RAM to 6 or 8 GB? I've read that SSD will make my MacBook much faster, but will it have an effect on Java development?\n\nA: TL;DR: Yes on both accounts.\nStart with RAM. Max it out at 8 GBs. My compile times dropped in half going from 4 GB to 8 GB -- swapping is a performance killer and the primary cause of the beach ball on OS X. More memory, less swapping. Happier development.\nThen go SDD. In my case I went to an SDD in my DVD drive slot. I never used the thing so didn't think it was worth keeping around. Compile times for larger Java projects on the SDD vs the HD are consistently 3x faster on the SDD.\nThere's a caveat to all of this: SDDs are unreliable. When they fail, they fail hard. That's why I opted to keep my Main drive on a spinning platter drive. Also remember: Time Machine doesn't back up anything by your Main drive. So that means nothing on my SDD is backed up by Time Machine. Why am I okay with this? Two words: revision control. I only do things on my SDD that are backed by revision control. In my case git. And I push my changes upstream fairly frequently. If the drive fails, I'd lose an hour or two of work and that's not so bad. Everything else is safe on my remote repository in the cloud.\n\nA: Upgrading to an SSD will make everything faster. Like, everything. Ok, so it won't make everything faster, but everything will feel quite speedy. Additional RAM will help as well, but you'll notice just an unbelievable difference in day to day usability and responsiveness.\nNow, with that said, SSDs are still quite expensive. If you have an older computer, it might be better to spend the money on a new machine (such as an Air with an SSD) instead a significant amount just for the new drive. This depends on the size you want to get. \n\nA: I upgraded my MacBook (see hardware specs here) and used the manuals from www.ifixit.com. The MacBook runs now very smooth and extremly fast :-)\n", "Q: How can I ensure that my iPod Classic lasts as long as possible? Word on the street is that Apple is very close to discontinuing the iPod Classic for good. I bought a brand new 160GB iPod Classic in June 2010 (during the last iteration of this rumor). I am an iPhone and iPod Touch user, but for music, I don't think anything beats a simple, dedicated device. I want to keep my iPod Classic going for as long as I can. \nSo, how should I treat it? I will avoid bumps and drops, and protect the case as much as possible. Will it be happier long-term if it lives plugged in, or if I cycle the battery? What temperature should I try to keep it at? Are there any concerns I should have about stress on the headphone jack if I leave a set of headphones plugged in all the time?\n\nUpdate almost three years later: it looks like Apple has finally pulled the plug on the iPod classic. Time to keep mine in a hermetically sealed box.\n\nA: The battery is your primary concern - it is a consumable part. You may only get 300 to 500 complete charges before it will not take a useful charge. Additionally, as a Lithium Polymer battery with no adaptive charging, it fades every year once it's made. The lower the average temperature, the less it fades. Try to always keep it less than 75 degrees and time above 95 is exceptionally bad for long term health (think 20% loss of capacity in one year). Even if you store it perfectly, you can expect to lose 25% capacity within 3-4 years.\nFor long term storage, it's best to charge it to just above 50% and let it self discharge down to maybe 40 or 35% and then charge it back up to over 50. Having it always full isn't the best - but you also want to use it, so just assume you will pay for a battery sooner or later.\nYou have to decide - do you want a museum piece that is under perfect storage conditions (battery not too full and not too empty - both of which are bad)?\nThe extremes can damage a battery significantly - damaging the chemistry:\n\n\n*\n\n*totally low voltage - drained past all the low limits (leaving it in a drawer when discharged)\n\n*excessive heat past 115 F is also very bad - even for a few hours\n\n\n\nThe rest of the failures are more about chance of random failure since you won't be dropping it or crushing it :-)\nThe hard drives in 4G and older iPods were designed for occasional use, so running them in disk mode or running a mac on an OS installed on the iPod was likely to cause them to fail after months or years of that use. You might avoid running an OS - but for normal syncs and play, the drive spins down most of the time and this shouldn't be a big concern. Physical shock when the hard drive is spinning would of course be bad.\nI suppose the spring in the headphone jack would rather be out than in (some tiny amount of less stress) - but also less duty cycles is also good. I say, as long as you won't jam the plug / crush the internals - leaving it in all the time might be better than always putting it in/out/in/out.\nYou've got 5 years of swap service from Apple and you can always get a third party estimate if it ever dies, knowing that Apple will seal a new case in the factory. Any other repair (or DIY) can result in a bent/damaged or less than perfect case seal (As hard as it is to open them, the latest classics are even harder to close again properly than the old ones that you could use a nylon spudger or a flat razor blade to crack open.)\nGood luck! I plan to get one of the last classics - once they go on sale as a discontinued product and treat it with kid gloves. \n\nA: When loading songs, try to avoid fragmentation of data on the HDD and load it up all at once as much as possible, instead of adding songs, deleting a few here and there, copying new songs on, ad nauseum.\n\nA: There are various sites on the web which will show you how to repair an iPod classic, and where you can order various replacement parts for it. \nIt might be a good idea to order some replacement parts now, especially because the 160gb version is already \"old\" now that the newer ones are smaller.\nEventually it will die. Best idea is to be prepared.\n", "Q: My mac boots to a grey screen - target disk mode works My macbook boots to a grey screen - BUT the hard drive is OK.\nI tested it in target disk mode and the drive loads fine on  my other machine, so I can only assume it is something to do with the display.\nI've reset the PRAM/NVRAM , can anyone offer any advice on how to proceed from here?\n\nA: Boot to Single User Mode (Cmd S) let it do it's thing and then type: \ncd /var/log\n(press enter)\ngrep disk0 * \n(press enter). \nTowards the end of the outputted logs if you se IO Error your hard drive or flex cable are going. \nIf you can boot in safe mode (holding down shift at start up) maybe you have a dodgy 3rd party kernel extension. \n", "Q: How to define the VPN PPTP port in OSX Lion? Is there any change to set the port to use when connecting to a PPTP VPN from a Mac?\nI configured a VPN at home from Server 2008 so I can access my home server and use ports like RDP, VNC, IMAPS (Gmail), ..., that are blocked.\nThe problem is that port 1723 is also blocked. So I configured my home router to accept requests on port 443 (HTTPS) and forward it to port 1723 of the VPN Server.\nCan I tell the OSX to use port 443 instead of 1723 for that VPN connection?\nThanks!\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is not possible to change OS X's built-in PPTP client's port. However, you can use a third-party client such as OpenVPN. OpenVPN has many more options and will allow you to specify the port with which to connect to the server.\nGood luck and happy tunneling!\n", "Q: How do I add attachments in iPad Mail? My friend has an iPad 2 and we can't seem to find a way to attach photos to emails using the standard Mail software the device comes with.\nWhat are we missing?\n\nA: It doesn't work this way. \nYou can add images by \n\n\n*\n\n*going to the Photos app, \n\n*selecting the pictures you want to add\n(I believe it's a button on the upper right of the screen to switch to selection mode), \n\n*and tap on Copy, once you selected them,\n\n*then you can go back to your mail, tap where you want to add them\n\n*and select Paste\n\nA: That's right (and sometimes rather confusing). To add pictures to a message, you start in the Photo app and select pictures to share. You can then either send the pictures directly from Photos or copy them to the clipboard and paste them into your emai afterwards.\n", "Q: MacBookPro / MacBookAir performance question I plan to replace my old MacBook with a new MacBookPro or Air but I am not exactly sure what I need. I work as a windows software developer so I need to run Windows with Visual Studio 2010. I am very sure this is no problem on any new machine and Bootcamp but I would like to run my windows only in a virtual machine. So I will be working with Visual Studio while still be able to use all the OSX tools the same time.\nIs a MacBookAir powerful enough to do that?\n\nA: With 4GB of RAM max, an Air would work, but you'd get tremendously better performance with 8GB in a Pro (ideally with an SSD).\nI upgraded my Mid 2010 2.4GHz i5 to 8GB and an OWC 120GB SSD, and Windows (XP and 7) VMs under VMware Fusion 3 are much, much more responsive, along with the rest of the system.\n\nA: I'm hoping the next model of Air's will be able to handle more than 4GB.  This is especially key with VM's.  The SSD is such an awesome upgrade to any machine.  Apple has a great return policy, so I'd get the Air and try it out for a week or so and then return it for the Pro if it doesn't work out.\nDon't forget that VMware just released version 4 and it's better than ever!\n\nA: If you can develop on a Windows PC with 2 GB of memory, than a VM on a MacBook with 4GB should work just fine.  A MacBook Air with its standard built-in SSD will most likely compile/build noticeably faster than a MacBook Pro or Windows laptop with just a stock HD.  And there seem to be lots of software developers (Mac, Windows, linux, iOS, etc. development) using MacBook Airs recently.\n\nA: The Air is powerful, and the SSD does make it feel way faster than any Macbook Pro without SSD, however, I'd recommend you get a Macbook Pro with 8GB of RAM and then add a cheap SSD. I have an 11'' Air upgraded to the i7 1.8 & 256 GB SSD and it's way faster than the Macbook Pro 13'' with same ram (4gb) and a regular hard drive. Both were new machines, but the SSD is godsend. \nThat said, Parallels and VMware are not memory friendly, you need ram… lots of RAM. on the Mac Pro with 10 GB (and also SSD) things are super fast, but on a constrained machine like the AIR you might be in troubles (despite the SSD mitigation).\nThe best you can do is get one and try it.\n", "Q: Why does my 13\" MacBook Pro have trouble running Adobe Bridge on a 27\" Apple Monitor?

My goal is to archive the local backup to the network drive, thereby freeing up local disk space.  \nThe rsync command I  am using is:\nrsync -aPW * /Volumes/netshare/path\n\nFor some reason, my free disk space is decreasing as rsync runs, and I eventually run out of space.  After killing the rsync process and waiting, the consumed disk space is eventually freed and returns as free space.\nIt seems as if the copied files are being cached locally (even though they're already on the local drive) prior to being copied by rsync.  I've checked and it's not swap space, and I have 1.5 GB of free RAM as rsync is running.\nHas anyone else noticed this and is there a way to disable this caching in rsync?\nUpdate:\nI've tested with rsync, cp, and copying a file in Finder, and free disk space decreases in all 3 scenarios, so it's a general OS issue.  I've been using lsof to see which files rsync has open, and nothing there appears to be growing in size.  My theory has been that the files are being cached somewhere on the drive as the copy progresses.  I have > 2GB RAM free and 0 swap space being used, so it doesn't appear to be a virtual memory usage issue.\nAs I mention below, disabling local snapshots also had no effect on the growing disk space.\n\nA: My first guess would be that you got a typo in the target path (/Volumes/netshare/path, especially the netshare part) and are actually duplicating the data onto the source drive.\nIf not, I don't really see the benefit of using rsyncfor a one-off copy operation with limited risk of interruption -> just use cp instead, OSX takes care of the network part anyway if you copy something to a share mounted under /Volumes.\nIf you absolutely want to use rsync leave off the -PW options for a starter. -W is used anyway unless you sync directly to another server by specifying the target as remotehost:path/to/dir, -P is only needed if the sync runs the risk of getting interrupted.\n\nA: Possibly this?\nhttp://rdutoit.home.comcast.net/~rdutoit/pub/robsoft/pages/backup.html\n\n  \n*\n  \n*If you are backing up to an external drive, check the hidden Volumes folder. This is a known problem when copying files to an external disk. Sometimes, if you pull the plug accidentally on a drive, or for no apparent reason, the Volumes folder will contain left over aliases of drives that are no longer present. This can result in data being copied into them instead of your desired disk, thus your hard drive mysteriously fills up with \"hidden\" backups! To check the folder go to the \"GO\" menu in the finder menu bar and select \"Go to folder\" and type \"/Volumes\" in the search filed. This will bring up the hidden folder. I have included a menu item called \"Show Volumes folder\" in the Window menu, or the Help menu if you are in Background mode.\n  \n\n(backup list is a gui wrapper to rsync)\n\nA: I think I figured it out via http://www.reedcorner.net/news.php/?p=238.  Mac OS X Lion caches Time Machine backups to the local HD, in a new feature called local snapshots.  You can disable this using \nsudo tmutil disablelocal\nNo more wonky, frequently fluctuating free disk space!\nUpdate:\nFalse alarm, apparently. Disabling local snapshots didn't solve the problem, and the disk space is still being consumed as rsync progresses. Large files copying result in a greater amount of disk space consumed. I've gone from 4.35 GB free down to 1.5 GB, then I killed rsync.\n\nA: Finally figured it out.  The network share was mounted via WebDAV.  Thinking this could be the issue, I created an SMB mount (of the same remote share) to test.  Sure enough, the files transferred without resulting in decreasing free disk space!  So the problem lies somewhere in Mac OS X WebDAV client.  Apparently files are being cached locally in the processes of being copied to the remote share.\n", "Q: Set up Gmail to work properly with Apple Mail \n*\n\n*I often can't find my sent mail in my Gmail account viewed on my Mac in Apple Mail.

Rebooting the Airport Express fixes the problem.\nWhat could be causing this, and is there any solution that doesn't involve climbing under the desk in my family room twice a week to unplug and replug the Airport Express?\n\nA: In a WLAN used primarily with the same computers all the time, a DHCP lease timeout of 4 hours isn't necessary. You can easily set this to 4 weeks.\n\nA: I have the same issues - sometimes it'll die by the end of the day. It used to be much more frequent, then I saw a comment about turning off DHCP on it totally, and just giving it a static IP. I picked the top IP in the range, and it'll never get used.

I installed rEFit and then installed Windows 7. Now I need the drivers that normally get installed with Boot Camp Assistant. Does anybody know where to find them? I can't find them on Apple's site.\n\nA: They are on one of the installation disks that comes with your iMac. Also, I'm pretty sure the drivers get installed if you download and run a \"Bootcamp Software Update for Windows\"  from Apple's support site.

From Server.app you have to stop the Device manager and Wiki from starting.\n", "Q: Website gets blocked by webfilterproxyd even without website restriction I have a Mac Mini running Mac OS X 10.6.4 which has Parental Controls enabled for an account, but with Website Restrictions set to 'Allow unrestricted access to websites'.\nHowever, there is one website (which I cannot specify for confidentiality reasons) which does not load at all.

It is better to turn Parental Controls off than to wreck it.\nWhat was probably going on is that you need to, in the main firewall (under Security, in System Preferences), allow incoming connections from that IP address. You may need to configure the firewall manually, if so, consult a complete tutorial.\nAlso, 49757 is not the port the request was coming from, it is the local port the request is attempting to connect to.\n\nA: Turns out it can be solved by doing:\nsudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/webcontentfilter.kext/\n\nThis might cause a few errors in the system log but appears to work fine for me.\n\nA: Yosemite 10.10.5\nBefore, i suppose that copy/compress this folder should be wiser.\n\nzip -r /System/Library/Extensions/webcontentfilter.kext.save.zip/ /System/Library/Extensions/webcontentfilter.kext/\n\nthen \n\nsudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/webcontentfilter.kext/\n\nViolent, but that's work, thanks !\nI have full access to the network with Parental Control\n", "Q: How do I get EyeTV to work on my 2007 iMac? I'm running a 2007 24\" iMac, and recently installed OS X Lion.  I am trying to use the EyeTV software for my Elgato TV tuner.

I have a vague understanding of what autofs is, but I have no idea why it is being invoked.  I looked up Apple's autofs source code and it seems that \"EyeTV Archive\" is being passed in as a key to something, somewhere (like I said, I know know much about autofs).  Can somebody help, please?\n\nA: My best guess is that you have an unmounted volume set in the EyeTV settings under Recording / \"EyeTV Archive\" Location. \n\nA: Try deleting any Library folders used by EyeTV before running the app. This has solved different issues that I have had with EyeTV in the past.

I've read many SSD postings and web sites but not gotten help on a particular scenario. \nI have a 2009 Mac Pro with a single 400 GB HDD installed.\nI want to add a 128 GB SSD for faster booting and performance. I can definitely fit that part of my existing HDD unto the smaller SSD. The question is how to install and configure. \nClearly I cannot do a Carbon Copy or similar operation. I guess I would want to install Lion onto the new SSD keeping the old HDD as a second drive.\n-- After I install the new SSD, how do I get Lion installed and booting from it?\n-- And, then, how do I disentangle whatever parts of Lion on the 'old' HDD so I can delete them?\nAny guidance, threads, hints would be really appreciated!\nThanks,\nPito\n\nA: You can definitely do it. But you either can't use your home folder to store your data for the most part, or you have to figure out how to do some kind of voodoo.\nWhat I did is not supported by Apple, but it works just fine. And you can take it in for repair under warranty no problem. So there's nothing to stop you from doing it.\nI got the information I needed here:\nhttp://www.ransom-note-typography.com/index.php/SSD_and_Your_Home_Directory\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2009/05/14/tuaw-tip-moving-your-home-folder-to-another-disk-or-moving-it/\nBasically the idea is you copy your user folder to a big conventional drive. Then you install Lion on a new SSD and create a user account with the same name. I named the big drive \"Users\" and then put the Home folders in its root.\nGo to Users& Groups in System Preferences. Right click on the account. Choose advanced options. For the Home directory field, there's a \"Choose\" button on the right. Click it and navigate to the copy of the account on the new User drive, and select it. Reboot. You will now be using the user account on the conventional drive. Your Desktop, Pictures, Music, Downloads, Documents, etc. folders are now on the big drive, but it's just like it's on the boot drive.\nA big benefit here is that you can format your boot drive and reconnect it to the User drive, and not touch your files at all. And you can clone the User drive and it won't contain your system files. (Or your Applications which remain on the boot drive.) \nIf it's not clear, ask questions and I'll try to clarify.\n\nA: Personally, I would get your MBP running Lion, as you want it, with the HDD. Move all the data you don't want on the SSD into a known place, preferably a different UDB/FW/Network drive. Just get your HDD down to 128Gb, if you can.\nYou can get little adaptors to connect internal drives via USB. Something like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812232002 It's temporary, and they work pretty well. I switched the drives in my old Apple TV using a similar trick.\nBasically, plug the SSD into the MBP, while it's still running on the HDD, and run SuperDuper (my preference) or CarbonCopy, or DiskUtils to duplicate the drives, masking off the data you don't want to copy over by either removing it as above, or telling the duplicating tool to ignore it if you can.\nThen, just switch them over.\nAt that point, you can wipe the HDD and use put it in a housing, leave it on your desk using the above USB adaptor, etc. Basically, it'll be your spare drive.\n\nA: Okay let's start with the first problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion\nI'm assuming this mac didn't come with Lion preinstalled and you bought it from the App store.  You'll need to create a bootable DVD or USB drive to boot from and then install Lion on the SSD.  This link will walk you through it: http://www.macworld.com/article/161069/2011/07/make_a_bootable_lion_installer.html\n2a.  I would probably attempt to use the Migration Assistant off a time machine backup.  The migration assistant is actually pretty good about letting you select various parts of the machine to move.\n2b. If that doesn't work, then I'd say this is a great opportunity to re-evaluate what you need.  I'd def sign up for a Dropbox account to move documents and what not over and then go about reinstalling applications from the web.  You can also install your existing boot drive into one of these:http://www.amazon.com/Vantec-NexStar-2-5-Inch-External-Enclosure/dp/B002JQNXZC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1317434844&sr=8-1 and then mount in on your SSD mac and drag over movies, music, etc.\n\nA: I successfully did it. For your edification, here was my procedure, based on these answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the ssd and format it\n\n*create a lion bootable usb memory stick\n\n*boot from the memory stick and format the ssd into a bootable lion disk\n\n*boot from the lion sdd and use the migration tool to migrate just: \n\n\n*\n\n*my /Users/pitosalas user directory but none of it's contents (because they were so huge)\n\n*the /Application directory (because I figured that would be the hairiest because of preference files etc.)\n\n\n*create symbolic links from /Users/pitosalas/Documents, Pictures and Music to their counterparts on the old HDD /Volumes/OldHDD/Users/pitosalas/Documents, Pictures and Music\nSo far so good. It's bizarre to be using my computer for hours and not hear a disk whirr. And it's very very fast, quite noticeable!\n", "Q: NoScript for Safari I find myself drifting away from Firefox to Safari, but the lack of NoScript is making me a little uneasy. Is there an equivalent plugin for Safari? \n\nA: There's also JavaScript Blocker.\n\nA: I'm not super familiar with NoScript, but from a quick glance at the site, I can think of two good starting points - how useful they are will depend on which features of NoScript you make use of.\nClickToPlugin is a great plugin blocker, pretty configurable, and it also has a fantastic h.264 replacement for Flash video. It substitutes h.264 video with a nice tidy player (mostly just the standard Safari player with one or two modifications) wherever it can, probably gets 80-90% of video in my experience. Makes in-browser video a lot nicer.\nJavaScript Blacklist blocks 3rd party JS stuff, good for stuff like tynt.com and all those double-underlined shopping popup links in forums. Configuration options may be a bit basic for your tastes, but it's a good start.\n\nA: Ghostery is a great option if you're just aiming for privacy. It runs in every browser on every operating system, even mobile ones.\n", "Q: Why is my MBP not detecting my HDD/Optical Drive? I've had a second hard drive in one of those optibay things in my MBP 5,1. It's been super awesome, until it stopped getting detected today.\nThe second hard drive is getting power and is spinning up, but is not being detected at all. I've made sure the SATA connector is on tight and even clean all the connectors with some compressed air. The second hard drive does not show up in Disk Utility or System Profile.\nI swapped out the original second hard drive with another hard drive I had laying around and that one didn't get detected either. I even placed my optical drive inside and it won't get detected either.\nI plugged the two hard drives into a USB enclosure and they both get detected.\nI've also reset the PRAM and NVRAM.\nWhen running the Snow Leopard DVD in the external enclosure, I wasn't able to detect the second hard drive in Disk Utility. \nWhat can I do to fix this? Could Lion be doing something fishy? Is it the logic board?\n\nA: A quick check I would suggest is to launch the terminal and check if the OS can see the HDD.\n$ diskutil list\n\nThis will list the HDD's and their partitions. This should bypass any finder issues.\n\nA: I have the same problem and found this answer. Its probably the logic board.\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/58398/\n\nA: The troubleshooting theory in me would want to try a different optibay to try to eliminate variables.  If the optipay is verified good, then something on the logic board could be the problem.  These are tough issues because Apple's ASD/AHT tools won't be of much use since its a modified hardware situation.\n\nA: Based on the troubleshooting you've performed so far, all signs point to the logic board being faulty.\nIf possible, check that the optibay is good by connecting to another system. However, since two known good HDD's and an optical drive fail to be picked up, I'm pretty certain it's the logic :(\n", "Q: How much RAM can a 2007 iMac hold? The box says I can add up to 3 GB (for a total of 4GB), but is this restriction hardware based, or because of the operating system?\nIf I upgrade to OS X 10.6 or higher, can I increase the RAM to 8 GB like the newer models?\n\nA: According to MacTracker, it looks like Apple officially supports a 4GB configuration, but it can hold up to 6GB. (This is for model \"iMac8,1\").\n", "Q: How to start a slideshow on the Mac quickly and easily? This is one thing I don't quite get it for the Mac: why is it so hard to start a slideshow?\nThe most often way is, I have several photos on the Desktop or in Downloads, and I double click to see the first one -- and no, it is not the one I want, so I want to see the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.   At least on Win 7, that's super easy just by pressing the right arrow on the keyboard and that's it.\nOn the Mac, is there a super easy way?  I don't want to highlight this and that, and then choose \"Slideshow\" from some where I can't be sure of, or change the view to the \"flip through\" view, because I might not necessarily want to change the view style for the folder at the moment -- I just want to browse through a few photos -- is there a super quick way?\n\nA: In Leopard and later versions (up to El Capitan), select the files you want in the Finder and press the spacebar to invoke QuickLook. You can then use the arrow keys to cycle through them. If you click the full-screen icon, Finder and QuickLook displays the slideshow. You get extra animation in some os versions if Finder is showing files in cover-flow layout. \nIn OS X Yosemite 10.10 and later, the maximise (full-screen) button is in the upper left-hand corner. Then press \"play\" to start the slideshow.\nFor OS X 10.9 to 10.7 the full screen icon is top right. \nIn Tiger, there is a \"Slideshow\" option in the context menu in the Finder.\nIn Panther and earlier, it is indeed several steps before you can get a slideshow.\n\nA: If you use OS X \"Quick Look\" you can use right/left arrow on the keyboard and view all of the photo on the same path; but you have some problem yet, \"Quick Look\" let you view all the file exist in the same path not just photo.\n\nA: Select a picture or group of images from the desktop, then use the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Option+Spacebar to launch image(s) into the full-screen slideshow mode \n\n*Spacebar to pause/play the image slideshow \n\n*Left Arrow to go back, Right Arrow to go forward \n\n*Gesture with two-fingers left to go forward, two-finger gesture right to go back \n\n*Option to view smaller images at actual size \n\n*Click “Index Sheet” to view thumbnails of all images in the slideshow \n\n*Click “Add to iPhoto” to import the image into iPhoto \n\n*Hold Control key and use a two-fingered back or forward swipe in to zoom into the photo \n\n*Escape to exit \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Select all files in Finder in the order you want them viewed.\n\n*Open them with Preview (Cmd+O)\n\n*Begin a slideshow (Cmd+Shift+F)\n\n\nA: Update for Big Sur and possibly earlier versions of macOS:\n\n*\n\n*In the search box, type in image, and choose \"Type Image\"\n\n*Now click on the first file, press Space Bar\n\n*Use the down arrow to view them all\n\nOn Windows, it was double click on one image, and you can already use the arrow keys to view the image before and after.  I wonder why the Mac doesn't do it this way. It should be very easy to implement, but on the Mac we have to go through step 1, 2, 3 above.\nI am using Snow Leopard:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the first file you want to see\n\n*Press Space Bar to start quick look\n\n*Press up or down arrow key to cycle through all photos / videos / any docs (up or down arrow depending on how you have the items sorted in the list)\n\nthat's it!  (still, I don't understand why the default Preview won't let you cycle through anything?)\nUpdate: unfortunately, this is only possible if you are in the Cover Flow view (the flip through view).\n\nA: In macOS Monterey, there is a very easy way to quickly slideshow items (including photos/pictures) in Finder:\n\n*\n\n*Select the item(s) that you want to slideshow;\n\n*Press ⌥ option-space bar OR ⌥ option-⌘ command-Y (They are totally equivalent).\n\nJust that simple and elegant.\n\nA: I wrote a simple script, that does this: 1) opens the selected folder 2) selects all files in that folder 3) starts slideshow. Can be saved as an App and then put in the toolbar of Finder. Works on Big Sur/M1, however you have to allow Script editor and this App 'Accessibility' and 'Automation' in System Preferences/Security&Privacy:\ntell application \"Finder\"   \n    activate    \n    tell application \"System Events\"        \n        tell process \"Finder\"           \n            key code 31 using {command down}            \n        end tell        \n    end tell\n    \n    activate    \n    tell application \"System Events\"        \n        tell process \"Finder\"           \n            key code 0 using {command down}         \n        end tell        \n    end tell\n    \n    activate    \n    tell application \"System Events\"        \n        tell process \"Finder\"           \n            key code 49 using {option down}         \n        end tell        \n    end tell    \nend tell\n\n", "Q: How much does Hardware Growler affect performance? I'm interested in knowing how much Hardware Growler affects performance.\nMy MacBook's performance at some of point in time became terrible and I could not figure out the reason. The Beachball of Death was spinning most of the time and I was thinking of getting a new machine because the current one was almost unusable.\nI thought that the problem was related to hardware as the Activity Monitor was not showing any intensive CPU usage. Finally, I had a brainwave and removed Hardware Growler and all my performance problems went away. \nI'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem or would be helped by this observation.\nIf anyone knows the exact reason why this would be that would be a bonus.\n\nA: Seems like I just had the same effect on Mountain Lion. The computer was so slow that I started to prepare for a reinstall of ML. The machine just hung for minutes just as described here. When I disabled Hardware Growler (newest version from the Mac App Store), performance went up again as if it were a fresh installation!\nI will keep an eye on this...\n\nA: In the past, pre-Lion, and on my Mini, I've seen it start to take up huge amounts of RAM. Far more than a trivial background app should, but never seen it start using up much CPU.\nI've definitely had to kill it for hogging the RAM though.\n\nA: Have not noticed any performance differences after the upgrade to High Sierra which made everything more snappy with the conversion to APFS (Apple file system) which is optimized for SSD storage and looks at SSD's differently. \n", "Q: When I purchase TV shows on my iPad 2, why are they automatically downloading on my Mac?

This way, if you buy something on your iPad you would have to manually download it on your Mac. This can be done by going to iTunes>Preferences..., then to the \"Store\" tab and unchecking \"Always check for available files.\"\nHope it Helps!\n", "Q: How to learn a wireless router's MAC address I am using Mac OS X Lion.

However, when this happens, I noticed that it still permits you to stream the episode.\nSo is there a difference with streaming vs. downloading in terms of how much bandwidth is used? If not, why is streaming permitted when downloading isn't?\n\nA: In both cases, you need to download the same number of bytes, but streaming takes them at a much slower rate, thus using less bandwidth (which is measured in terms of data divided by time).\nWhen streaming a podcast, you need to download a minute's worth of audio every minute, plus slightly more for buffering.\nGiven that it doesn't take an hour to download an hour long podcast, you are getting far more data per minute when downloading than you are when streaming.\nTo put it differently, if you're streaming an hour-long podcast, you are guaranteed to be transferring only that one podcast over the network during the next hour -- and if you stop and move on to something else, you stop downloading that podcast.\nIf you're downloading an hour-long podcast, you might download several of them during a one hour period, putting much higher demand on the network.\n", "Q: \"Other\" Storage space in Sys Info I have  MBP with Lion.  In my Sys Info it says 170.12GB of space is being used by \"Other\".  How do I determine what this Other space is and how to clean it up if possible?\n\nA: \"Other\" is all the files on your drive that aren't Audio, Movies, Photos, Apps, or Backup; in other words, all your documents and other saved files (and any media files in a format that System Information doesn't recognize as media files).\nIf you want to determine what files are taking up a lot of room on your drive, a tool like OmniDiskSweeper (free from OmniGroup) can help you identify where and what the files are that are taking up large amounts of space on your drive. Note that you might end up wanting to \"clean it up\" and you might discover that the space is taken up by files that you value and want to keep.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro freezes 4 or 5 times a day with no info in the Console My mid-2011 MBP (Core i7, Lion), seems to fart around 4 or 5 times a day.

It all happened after I updated my OS X.\n\nA: Your hard drive could be failing. Download SMART utility to check.\n\nA: This is almost certainly some kind of hardware problem. It could very well be your hard drive, as @M123 suggests. It could also be memory or even something wrong on the logic board. It's hard to narrow down without further tests, but with mouse and everything freezing, it's almost certain a low-level lock up.\nWhat is your situation for bringing it to an Apple store or getting some diagnostic tools?\n\nA: If you have a recent backup, I would say an erase and install can verify if it is something wrong with your hard drive, or if it is a software issue. \n", "Q: Addressing Console.app messages on badly installed and removed software \n*\n\n*Ever since I upgraded to 10.7, my computer has been acting funny, I lost my PostgreSQL installation so tried to install it again using the postgres 9.1 dmg from the postgres website.

I want to buy a Mac App Store game, but I don't want to play it in an office chair: I want to sit in front of my TV! Is there a way to stream the video output of Mac, wirelessly, to my television? The TV is currently connected to a Playstation 3, Wii, and AppleTV, and if this is at all possible, I'd like to do it without having to \"hack\" any one of those devices. Is there anything I can do here?\n\nA: None of the devices currently connected to your television can help you display audio and sound from your Mac without hacking. And even then, it's not likely you'll get them to work as a wireless display/sound bridge.\nYou could use something like the Atlona PC to HDTV Wireless Adapter to send your audio and video from your Mac to your TV (that one is Mac-compatible). Are you going to enjoy this experience? I'll admit I'm very skeptical that this wireless streaming approach is going to produce a 1080p frame rate that makes you happy and comfortable playing a game. And at $200 that seems like an expensive experiment to me.\nYour best bet is to get a HDMI adaptor for your specific Mac (see the Apple Store for compatible adaptors) and run the HDMI cable to your television. You can run HDMI about 50' before you need to start worrying about a repeater to ensure signal fidelity.\n", "Q: Where can I find my crash logs?

Don't forget to look in /private/var/log as well.\n\nA: ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ (where ~ refers to your Home directory).\n~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice are the crashlogs for your iOS devices (if any).\n~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter also has links to items in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ \n\nA: To find the crash files, you can run Console app which will display all the system messages. If any specific application crashed, look in User Reports. If it's system crash, check in System Reports. Once you have found the crash file, you can Reveal in Finder (usually located in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports).\nIf the crash resulted in reboot, in All Messages look line stating its Shutdown Cause and check the following list of Shutdown Causes for further information.\nAlternatively you can also check the log files in /var/log (such as system.log), or in real-time by log stream.\nYou can also check where dumps are generated by monitoring system.log file, e.g.\ntail -f /var/log/system.log | grep crash # Hit Control-C to stop.\n\nTo scan for the previous crash files, run:\ngrep crash /var/log/system.log\n\nTo generate the actual core dump files (in /cores), see: How to generate core dumps in macOS?\n\nTo make sure your macOS is healthy, perform the following tests:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use coconutBattery app to check your current battery health.\n\n*Run Apple Hardware Test.\n\n\n\nIf your system reboots often, you can also try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you didn't modify your boot-args (check by nvram boot-args).\n\n*Reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\n\n*Reset NVRAM.\n\n", "Q: Why might an Apple TV stop playing purchased content from iTunes? I am trying to watch television shows that I just purchased through the iTunes store on my Apple TV. Every time I try to play any purchased shows on my Apple TV, it gives me the error message\n\nAuthorization is required. To play this content on your Apple TV,\n  choose Authorize This Computer from the Store menu in iTunes on your\n  computer, then enter the Apple ID and password used for the purchase.\n\nI have done this. I have restarted the Apple TV. I have deauthorized and reauthorized my computer. It still gives me this error message. I have tried signing out of and back into the Apple TV, and that doesn't work either. This is the first time I've seen this message in the year + I have had this Apple TV. Also, it was playing purchased content just fine last week. Something has apparently changed since then, and I can't figure out what.\nHow do I get my Apple TV to recognize this purchased content again?\n\nA: The explanation I got from Apple is there is some maintenance being performed on an iTunes server this weekend, which is affecting AppleTV's ability to authorize content.  Even if you are streaming directly from your PC/MAC to the AppleTV, there is still some validation with the iTunes store that occurs.\nIn the meantime, you can use Airplay to continue to stream content to your AppleTV.  More info on using Airplay can be found here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4437.\n\nA: TUAW is reporting that this is a known issue affecting many Apple TV users, and it does not have a fix yet.\n\nUsers report error messages preventing them from accessing and playing back content: \"Authorization is required. To play this content on your Apple TV, choose Authorize This Computer from the Store menu in iTunes on your computer, then enter the Apple ID and password used for the purchase.\"\nIf your Apple TV unit is affected, you are not alone. TUAW has received many user complaints and links to sites where frustrated customers have gathered. Apple's KB support posts do not appear to be helping customers resolve these issues.\n\nSounds like we'll have to wait on some kind of statement or solution from Apple.\n\nA: Play the same content on your computer too - sometimes that can loose the authorization, then when you play it through the AppleTV, that isn't authorized either.\nBasically, make sure both ATV, and Computer are reauthorized.\n", "Q: What are all these Python files? What are the .py, .pyo, and .pyc files in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/X11/xcb?\n\nA: These are the Python bindings for X11.

I'd like to disable the next/previous song keys, because I rarely need them but often press by accident when pausing/playing. Keyboard shortcuts doesn't seem to provide a solution, and neither does googling around.  \nMy OS X version is 10.7.1, in case it matters.\nThanks!\n\nA: You should take a look at Function Flip. It can selectively toggle function keys between being regular function keys or the special hardware keys, including the media keys (F7, F8, and F9). Essentially, it does the same thing as \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" setting (System Preferences > Keyboard), except only to individual function keys instead of all of them.\n", "Q: Open System Preferences with a keyboard shortcut I set up a shortcut in System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts:\n\nBut it doesn't work. What's wrong?\n\nA: Add it as a global shortcut (under All Applications, not System Preferences), and include an ellipsis in the menu name (either ... or ….):\n\nThe only apps this method works for are System Preferences, System Information, and App Store. For others, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch an OS X app with a keyboard shortcut - Super User (instructions for using AppleScripts, a list of third party apps that support application triggers)\n\n*OSX show/hide specific app global hotkey? - Super User (instructions for using Automator services)\n\n\nA: When you add a keyboard shortcut and list it for a particular application, the key binding only applies when that application is active. Thus, if you made Control-Shift-Z a shortcut for Zoom and applied that to Safari, that would mean that in Safari, and only in Safari, pressing Control-Shift-Z would zoom (i.e. same as clicking the the green button in the upper left hand corner of the window). Binding keyboard shortcuts to particular applications usually makes sense because each application has its own set of menu commands.\nIn your particular case, creating a key binding to launch System Preferences and binding it to System Preferences is guaranteed to never do what you want, because the only time it would launch System Preferences would be when System Preferences is already the active application.\nThe fix is to insert System Preferences... (with three periods, not an ellipse) as a shortcut in the All Applications section.\n\n", "Q: How to boot my mac mini up when my iPod Touch is near? What I'm trying to achieve is if I'm near my mac mini (10 meters) I want to press a button (or something else) on my ipod touch and than my mac mini should boot up.\nHow could I make that?\nThere's a wifi network in which my ipod is. My mac is in there also but my mac is off.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: On your Mac mini enter Energy Saver in System Preferences and enable the Wake for network access.  Then find an app in the App Store that does Wake on Lan, this is one such app - http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inet-wol-wake-on-lan/id318696675?mt=8 that I found during a search.  There might be others that fit your needs better.\n\nA: What you want is called Lights Out Management (LOM), or IPMI. I don't know if LOM is supported by the Mac Mini. It was in Xserves, so it might be available if you have a newer Mac Mini and/or the server model. It may also require running OS X Server. I believe this is in the Power Management pane of System Preferences (although I'm not sure...anybody with access to Server care to comment?).\nIf you can get that set up there is an iOS app called IPMI touch ($4.99) which can power on IPMI enabled nodes.\n", "Q: Can't eject Windows 7 install disk to get drivers from Snow Leopard Install Disk Alright.

Hold Option down at startup to choose whether to boot OS X or Windows.\n", "Q: unecm trouble mac os x 10.6.8 I am having trouble decoding a .ecm file on my computer.  This is my first Mac so I'm new to the different operating systems.  I'm on a MacBook Pro, Snow Leopard I believe, I know I haven't upgraded to Lion.  10.6.8 seems to be the current version.  I have the cmdpack downloaded from Neill Corlett, just not sure how to use it really.  Any help you can give would be much appreciated.  Thanks.\n\nA: The cmdpack you downloaded are command line tools. If you have a recent mac, you should have downloaded the Mac OS X (64-bit, x86_64) version.\nTo use these tools, you'll need to venture into the UNIX command line. This is analogous to the command prompt of Windows, and can be accessed using the Terminal application in /Applications/Utilities.\nOnce you've downloaded the cmdpack.gz file, uncompress it to a directory by double-clicking it. For ease of explanation, then drop the .ecm file you want to work with into that directory. Open Terminal (either find it in Utilities or Spotlight search for it) and then navigate to the cmdpack directory (the easiest way to do this is to type cd followed by a space, and then drag the directory to your terminal window--the path of the folder will be inserted--then hit return).\nWhen you're in the appropriate working directory, you can type ls to list its contents. The executable you want to run is most likely unecm. The easiest way to run an executable in your current working directory is by prefixing it with ./. If you type ./unecm, the command will run and show you usage information. If you already dropped your .ecm file into this directory, unencoding it should be as simple as ./unecm myecmfile.ecm\nTo recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Mac OS X (64-bit, x86_64) command-line pack and uncompress/ungzip it.\n\n*Open Terminal and navigate to the uncompressed directory (for me this command was cd /Users/nreilingh/Downloads/cmdpack-1.02-macosx-x86_64)\n\n*Run unecm as necessary with ./unecm after cding to the ungzipped directory.\n\n", "Q: How can the 'mail' command be used? I've had my first Mac for about five months now. Though, even when I was a full-on Windows user, I never did things through a command line; I was pretty much for the GUI all-the-way..\nBut now that I have my Mac, I'm interested in learning a little about the Terminal and the commands used in it. So far I've learned how to do minor things, like moving, renaming, and deleting files, ect. But now I want to go for something different, like the mail command.\nSo tonight I figured out how to send mail to myself through the 'mail' command. But now I'm curious and asking if there's a way to send e-mail to people using say, Yahoo or Hotmail.\nSorry if this is a basic question, but I'm new and curious. Thanks.\n\nA: It you want to send an email to a given address put it as an argument to the mail command:\nmail -s \"Some subject\" toaddress@example.com\n\nsee man mail for other options\nAny text you type after issuing the command you can enter the text for your mail directly in the terminal. To end mail text entry, enter a new line with a single ..\nDo note that this just queues the mail for sending as if your mac were a functioning mail server. Local delivery to local accounts is easy to set up, to set up a working mail server that connects to the internet requires some more advanced set up as well as a relationship with someone else that operates a mail relay. This isn't a client that works directly with mail services like gmail / yahoo / hotmail or iCloud (MobileMe).\n", "Q: Versions support on a Samba share I have grown to really value Versions in Lion. However it only works on a locally mounted disk on my Mac.\nThe majority of my files are stored on Samba shares on Linux servers, for which Versions is not supported.\nIs there any workaround such that I can use Versions when editing documents on these Samba shares?\n\nA: The design of versions is very client Mac centric. \nThe local Lion OS detects an app is calling document based API and enabled the versioned store in a space that is local to the Mac and different than the actual document. \nAll version data is stored at /.DocumentRevisions-V100 and you can explore and test with simple documents in TextEdit to poke at the implementation artifacts. \nI suppose you could mount that directory to the server and experiment, but I don't see any locking or merge functionality and expect a world of hurt if two clients tried to share the same document and version chain simultaneously. \nPerhaps the engineering work will be done in the future to allow versions over Xsan storage, but it looks to me that the implementation is only for local versions. \n", "Q: Can you let Preview (the app) cycle through anything? This is related to this question:\nHow to start a slideshow on the Mac super quick and easy?\nBasically, I wonder why even in Snow Leopard, I double click on a photo in Finder, and Preview will show that photo, but no arrow key can let me see the next photo in the folder?   Is there a way at all?  Or will the next version of Mac OS X add it, I wonder -- is it that counter-intuitive to show the next one?\n\nA: As more or less already answered in the question you linked to, you can get the effect you want by \n\n\n*\n\n*selecting the first file, pressing Space to open Quick Look and use the cursor key to jump to the next one\n\n*selecting all the relevant files (pictures) and pressing Space to enter Quick Look\n\n*selecting all the relevant files (pictures) and pressing ⌘+O to open them in one Preview window\n\n*command-doubleclicking the folder containing the pictures to open a new finder window followed by ⌘+4 to switch the new window to Coverflow mode\n\n*command-doubleclicking the folder containing the pictures to open a new finder window followed by ⌘+3 to switch the new window to Column mode and just step through the files to get the content displyed in preview mode in the last column.\n\n\nGiven the different options already available to get the desired result, do we really need another one?\nPS: Technically speaking, Preview.app is just an application able to display pictures and PDFs. It doesn't know anything about a next file in a folder.\n", "Q: Can I stream videos to Apple TV using the VLC iPad app? Can I stream videos to an Apple TV using the VLC iPad app?\nIn other terms, can I browse through movies on my Mac and stream them to Apple TV?\n\nA: Unfortunately not. The VLC app was yanked from the app store some time ago due to some political issues within the developer base and conflicts with the app store policies. It hasn't been updated since then, and likely won't in the future. Also because it plays video in formats the iPad and Apple TV don't support, it's unlikely AirPlay support could be added anyway.\nYou might be able to use the iPad HDMI adapter to mirror the display on the TV, but I'm not sure how that performs with video going.\nIt's a bit outside the scope of AskDifferent, but there are several boxes similar in concept to the Apple TV that support a lot broader range of formats (much closer to VLC's level of support). I'm not aware of any that interface with an iPad, but most play from an attached hard drive or a network share. The WDTV Live and the Patriot Box Office are two popular ones, but there are many more.\n\nA: I had success by mirroring the iPad screen on the Apple TV, and then playing the video in VLC. VLC seemed to detect the situation, and displayed on the iPad screen \"this video is playing on an external display\" or something like that.\nThe video was:\n\n*\n\n*File format: ISO Media, MP4 Base Media v1 [IS0 14496-12:2003]\n\n*Video codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10)(avc1)\n\n*Audio codec: MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a) at 48 kHz\n\n", "Q: How do I use AppleScript to reveal a file in Finder from its POSIX path?

I have imported all photo's from my phone (Samsung Wave 525) to iPhoto. As I was using iPhoto for the first time, I did not want to delete all photos at the end of importing, preferring to check whether it as done properly first or not. Now that I know that all photos have been properly imported, how do I delete the existing photos from my phone ? \n(I've tried importing them again, using \"Import All\" option - though I get a dialog for what to do with duplicate files, I don't get that dialog which asks me if I wanted to keep the existing photos on the phone or not).\n\nA: It would be faster and possibly easier to connect the phone, open up Image Capture (comes with every mac) and view the photos there to delete them.\n\nA: Use Image Capture. It comes with OS X. Simply highlight the pictures you want to delete and hit the red-circle-with-a-line-through-it symbol to delete them.\n\nA: If there aren't many photos, the easiest way to do it is simply delete the photos on the phone. Unfortunately, this means selecting each photo individually as there is no 'select all' option.\nTo avoid individually selecting photos on the iPhone, you'll want to use the 'delete' option when prompted at the end of importing. Because iPhoto only deletes the photos that were imported at that time, you won't be able to do this with your 'normal' iPhoto library. To get around this, simply create another (throw away) iPhoto library to import the photos. Select 'delete' when prompted at the end of the import to delete the photos from the iPhone. Then you can delete this throw away library on your Mac.\nTo create a new iPhoto library, hold down the Option ⌥ key when launching iPhoto. This will display a window asking which library you would like to open or create a new library.\n\nA: You'll have to delete them on the phone, using whatever options the phone has for that purpose.\n", "Q: HOWTO convert documents to Kindle / mobi format?

It originally stood for:\niPhone Archive\nThen, when iPhone OS became iOS, they made up this new translation for it to make its purpose more clear.\n\nA: .ipa stands for iOS Application Archive.\n\nA: Its simple... IPA means IPhone Application...\n\nA: It means Internet Protocol Address\n\nA: As a rule, apps for the iPhone can only be obtained from the App Store as soon as they have been put up for sale there. The apps, so-called IPA files, can also be installed in a roundabout way.\nThere are various reasons why you might want to install an IPA file on your iPhone yourself. For example, to test a specially developed app or for other, less noble reasons. In this way, at least in theory, illegal copies of apps can be set up with the IPA files. However, you can also install IPA files in this way within narrow limits.\n", "Q: Is there a way to access my mac remotely by using browser only? I want to be able to browse/search my files, send email... nothing fancy like watch the movie and so on?\n\nA: Yes you can use logmein https://secure.logmein.com/\nAfter installing and setting things up you will just need your browser wherever you are.\n\nA: Yes, you need a remote access web-based application such as LogMeIn, Teamviewer or ScreenConnect.  You have to download the app on the host machine and should be able to connect in through the internet.  \n\nA: There are also browser-based VNC clients like noVNC:\nnoVNC is an open source VNC client using HTML5 (WebSockets, Canvas). It requires a browser with HTML5 support (this means it works on all major browsers but not on IE 10).\nnoVNC follows the standard VNC protocol, but unlike other VNC clients it does require WebSockets support. Many servers include support (e.g. x11vnc/libvncserver, QEMU, and MobileVNC), but for the others you need to use a WebSockets to TCP socket proxy. noVNC has a sister project websockify that provides a simple such proxy.\nSee the noVNC GitHub Readme file for more information.\n", "Q: OS X MacBook remote login with higher resolution Is there a way to remote login with a visual client to a MacBook, for example, with a higher resolution than the LCD attached?\nCurrently I tried VNC (with screen sharing) but that was limited to the resolution of the LCD. I also tried logmein but that had the same problem. I tried to use ssh+xming to the MacBook but that didn't seem to work either running applications seemed to start the displays on the remote machine rather than my client machine.\nI'm used to using RDP with Windows which lets you specify whatever resolution you want since the server resolution doesn't matter if you are accessing remotely.\n\nA: VNC is an interesting beast on OS X. In Lion, OS X finally gained the possibility of having truly virtual sessions, meaning that they aren't displayed on the console. This is accomplished by enabling VNC, and logging in as a user that is not logged in at the console. That new user will have a private session to work in, and the console user will go uninterrupted.\nIf you're unsure of what I mean by \"console\", the console is the one and only session that a user directly attached to the computer via keyboard/mouse/monitor can use. That is commonly referred to as the \"console\" or \"physical\" session.\nNote that on all previous versions of OS X, logging in as an allowed user could only put you on the console session, possibly colliding with a console user if they were actively working on the system at the same time.\nOn any other operating system, you can set up a private VNC session using almost any resolution you want, within a certain realm of feasibility. This is unfortunately yet to be the case on OS X. VNC still seems to hook into the physical capabilities of the system, perhaps this happens because the video card is used to render the desktop session even when you're using it remotely. Rendering the OS X animations is very intensive, so offloading them to the video card and freeing up general CPU time is an ideal situation for pretty much anybody.\nSo the answer? I don't believe you can. You can turn it down via the System Preferences like usual, but the highest resolution you'll get is that which is supported by your video card.\n\nA: I've found that I can attach my 1920x1200 resolution monitor momentarily to my normally headless MacMini, and it adds that resolution as one of the available ones.  It will retain it in the list where it is accessible to VNC (Real VNC from Win7 PC), at least until you reboot the mini :(.\nSo, it doesn't seem like there's any reason why one should have to attach a physical monitor to get higher resolutions.  There must be a place (a plist somewhere?) to add this resolution to the list?  Perhaps where the default 3 resolutions are stored?\n\nA: The two popular RDP servers for OS X do exactly what you are asking for. iRAPP / iRAPP Terminal Server and Aqua Connect Terminal Server are RDP servers for OS X that allow you to connect to a Mac remotely from any system running an RDP client. For example: you can remotely connect to your Mac from Windows by running Windows' built-in Remote Desktop application.\n\nA: This might help you. My development-work computer is an iMac sitting on my Baby Grand Piano. But for ergonomic reasons I prefer to work remotely from my old MacBook Pro 17” over home wifi to the iMac using Apple’s screen sharing app.\nWorks fine but theres a niggle. My MacBook screen res. is 1920 x 1200 but the iMac is 1920 x 1080 maximum native. So for remote work my screen real estate is squashed. I get to use only 1080 lines out of the 1200 available on my MacBook Pro, with black letter boxing above and below the video. A waste.\nTo my rescue comes a tiny product: fit-Headless by CompuLab for £21 - sold on Amazon. You plug it into the second monitor video port where it acts as a dummy second display with variable screen resolution options up to 4K.\nHowever on receiving it - I plugged it into my VDI port. It appeared in preferences as a second screen. BUT..... woe woe woe .. with all the options of screen res - going all the way up to 4K..... NO BLOODY 1920 x 1200 !!!! W T F !!!\nGoogled around. And came across and downloaded demo of an app called SwitchResX which does all manner of things to do with monitors. It too had tons of resolution options BUT STILL NO 1920 x 1200 !!. BUT..... hidden away was a tab where you can set up your own custom screen res. So added one for 1920x1200.\nAnd HEY PRESTO ! for an extra £18 for SwitchResX I can now work remotely on my iMac from my Macbook at the same high resolution as my macbook.\nNo letterboxing. More pixels to poke, drag and mouse around with..\nHAPPY DAYS !\n[ PS: these fit-Headless adapters are actually intended for people using Mac Mini’s as “headless” servers etc where they administer them remotely and don’t want to have an actual monitor attached.

But when I play music with my IPhone, the sound is not coming through the earpiece. \nIs there anyway I could \"channel\" the sound to the earpiece whenever I play songs with the iPhone?\n\nA: Sorry, but I don't think it will work. To send music over Bluetooth, the device needs to support the A2DP Bluetooth profile. Your headset (and most others not specifically intended for music) only supports the basic handsfree profile, so the iPhone can't send it music from the iPod app.\n", "Q: Can I direct audio from a single app to a particular output?

Otherwise you'll have to rely on premium (paid) apps, such as one of Ambrosia SW's \"Wiretap\" series of apps. Though those are pricy, $69 for WireTap Studio and $129 for WireTap Anywhere.\n\nA: I think this free app should do the trick. https://www.rogueamoeba.com/loopback/\n\nA: If the software you're using doesn't support specifying an an audio output, you'll have to rely on a third-party utility. Someone else already mentioned Ambrosia's WireTap products, but there is one other I'm aware of: Audio Hijack by Rogue Amoeba. At $32, it beats the pants off WireTap for price.\nUpdate for 2020  …\nAudio Hijack is current, but now $70.\nA simpler yet still effective solution targeted towards this very use-case by the same company is now SoundSource & is about half the price.\n[Prices [& tax] vary by territory]\nThere's also a piece of software called SoundSiphon by Static Z Software that provides the same functionality as Soundflower, plus single-application audio capture. Priced at $29.\n*Update for 2020 …\nSoundflower no longer includes Soundflowerbed, which was the component allowing this type of routing.\nUnfortunately, there are no free utilities for this. Not even Soundflower can capture audio from individual pieces of software. I think Rogue Amoeba's relies on the same underlying magic that allows them to hijack audio from individual pieces of software for their AirPlay utility AirFoil (which allows you to route any application's audio to any AirPlay device, as well as any device running their AirFoil Speakers app).\n\nA: I tried this to stream each app output to different sound channel\nhttps://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/\n", "Q: PowerBook G4 won't connect to Airport with WEP password I'm helping at a friend's house. She has a Airport Extreme setup with a WEP (yes, I really do mean WEP) password.  Her iMac running 10.5.8 connects to the network just fine.  I'm typing this question on that iMac.\nHowever when I try connecting to the same network with her PowerBook G4, sitting in the same room as the Airport Extreme, the PowerBook won't connect.  It asks me for a password but I can't get it to accept the password.  The PowerBook is running 10.4.11.\nWhen I select the network, I get dialog that says:\nThe selected AirPort network requires a password to join.\n\n    Wireless Security: WPA Personal\n\n    Password: ______\n\n[ ] Show password\n\n[ ] Remember password in my keychain\n\n(?)

WPA Personal is the only available option.\nSo, needless to say, if I enter the WEP password, it fails to connect.  What do I do?\n\nA: Way back in ye olden days I had the same issue with a iBook, it was never a 100% fix but if you go to Airport -> Join Other Network it'll allow you to pick the security type and enter the SSID for the network, that should trick it into working properly.\n\nA: Also go into AirPort's Advanced options, in the Networking section of System Preferences, and make sure that it doesn't 'remember' a network with the same name as the one you're trying to join: perhaps your friend changed the security but not the name, so the PB is trying to supply the wrong type of security credentials.\n", "Q: Indexing words separated by underscores When searching using Spotlight for, say, the word \"Exotic\", it fails to report the file Important_Exotic_Class.h, containing a C++ class by that name.\nCan you think of a method to make Spotlight index the portions of identifiers between underscores in .h and .cpp files? In the example above, the three words would be indexed.\nEven just indexing the words between underscores in filenames would be very useful.\n\nA: Spotlight should already index these files, it does on my Mac.

Here is a screenshot to visualize my problem :\n\nHow can I see any file dimensions in Finder, like I did with Snow Leopard ?\n\nA: It looks like this has to do with Spotlight. Finder's knowledge of additional file information is integrated with Spotlight, disabling it, or adding locations to the privacy  list will prevent Finder from reporting file information. This includes image dimensions.\n\nIf Finder is not reporting \"More Info,\" make sure that directory is not blacklisted by Spotlight.

I was having a discussion with some friends about the built in camera of computer and what you can do with them, and I realized that my macbook has one of those. That got me thinking about how the camera and LED are connected; Are they connected to the same power supply or can they be turned on or off individually?\nIf it's not connected to the same power supply has Apple said anything to ensure my privacy against anyone looking at me without the LED turning on?\n\nA: I don't think turning off the green light while accessing the iSight is possible. I have checked the following sources for evidences against:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security software like Prey and Undercover - They are highly motivated to do so, but unable to.\n\n*Drivers for other OS-es (Linux).\n\n*Forums, mailing lists and security advisories.\n\n\nAnd the conclusion is:\n\nAll Apple laptops have cameras that cannot be disabled (unless the LED is burnt out). Due to the way the iSight is set up electrically, the green light will always be on when in use.\n\n\nA: I have in the past seen screen savers that have been able to access the camera to create flame or color effects based of the captured video. These screesavers had active access to the camera and yet the green LED was off. These screen savers were running on an iMac 2008 with 10.5. I have since tried those screen savers on newer OSes and they weren't compatible. Not sure if Apple changed to OS to prevent those things, if there was a firmware patch or what but I have seen this before.\nI do agree with mspasov that Prey, Undercover, and Hidden are apps that would love this ability. If I see anything else in my search for an answer I will do my best to update.\n\nA: Apparently camera signals are used for adjusting screen brightness. Try it out: when you cover the camera lens, the screen goes darker within a few seconds. The change is even reflected on the bar graph you see when you manually adjust the brightness so no mistaking there. This proves that some optical information gan be read from the camera even though the indicator light is off.  \n", "Q: Can an 2009 iMac have an odd total amount of RAM? I have an iMac 20-inch early 2009 model. There is 2 GB of RAM (2 x 1 GB sticks). \nCan I upgrade the amount of memory to 3 GB, replacing just one of the two RAM sticks?\n\nA: You can but it's recommended to use matched pairs as you'll get more of a performance boost due to the way the Intel side of things handles dual-channel memory. However, more RAM generally trumps less RAM so it's probably worth it to get that extra Gb of memory.\n\nA: The 2009 iMacs should have a memory limit of 4GiB or 8Gib, depending on the exact model. Given current memory prices (which aren't likely to increase until the 2009 are so out of date that memory modules become rare), go for 4GiB.\n", "Q: Displaying minimised windows When I minimize safari, finder or Firefox windows, they move down to the dock.

This is working correctly on both my MBP mid 2009 with a NVIDIA GeForce 9400m and a  MB Air mid 2011 with an Intel HD 3000.

Does anyone have any reason to believe RAID 0 is any faster than independent drives on a Mac Pro?\nI have always run my Mac Pro with all five drives in RAID 0.  I recently decided to try out Bootcamp for running Windows & Linux, which, I believe, does not work with RAID.  I decided I would remove at least one drive from the RAID array, but now I'm reconsidering RAID altogether.\nMy next post on here will be, what's the easiest way to remove a drive from RAID 0 on Mac Pro.  :-)\nTIA\n\nA: Yes, RAID 0 is faster than using the drives independently of each other. Whether or not its noticeably faster depends on what kind of application you're looking at. Some setups benefit hugely from a RAID 0 setup, while for others, its pretty marginal.\nThere's also the convenience of everything being treated like one big drive.\nI will however say that spreading your data like this has one huge disadvantage. You've multiplied the number of potential points of failure by increasing the number of drives in your array, and the data isn't being protected by any sort of mirroring or large scale redundancy. When a RAID 0 array fails, it fails hard, and you'd be well served by having a very robust backup scheme.\nFor the record, my Mac Pro's drive are not in a RAID configuration.\n\nA: You will be fine, raid0 with an external 8TB time machine will serve your purpose. You have to be a retard if you don't have a backup solution to any raid0 configuration.\n", "Q: GOM player not running video I am trying to run movie on GOM player for Mac, when I open the movie, GOM player name appears on top of menu bar, but no player appears. \nThe same .avi file opened well in VLC player. I found out that if there is any other file of same name as .avi but of different extension exist in the folder, GOM player won't run that .avi file. As I have XVZ.avi and XYZ.srt, player didn't opened the file, then I changed the file name to XYZ2.avi. It opened.\nWhat could be the issue?\n\nA: I'd say it's an issue with GOM Player subtitle renderer. \nIt's probably trying to open/read the subtitles but fails and this failure makes it impossible to play the video (it's probably a bug in GOM Player, since most player would just skip the subtitle and play the movie anyway). \nI'd suggest you try another player, VLC is fine, Perian works great with QuickTime or MPlayerX which is free on the Mac App Store. And they all play subtitles, also.\n\nA: Just Change your GOM Player SKIN to \"BASIC\", if it is not.\n", "Q: How can I work in other applications while using PowerPoint presenter view on mac? In Windows it is possible to switch between and work with open applications when PowerPoint is open in presenter view. In this mode, the audience sees only the PowerPoint presentation, while you use the other applications.\nSo the presenter is viewing the presentation via the MacBook and the audience sees it on a projector.\nThis does not seem possible on the Mac. Does anyone know how this can be achieved?\n\nA: I am assuming multiple display setup in extended mode (not mirrored).  I had this problem as well.  \nI found that in PowerPoint Mac 2011:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to \"Slide Show\" tab in the ribbon.  \n\n*Click \"Set Up Show\" button.  \n\n*Change radio button for \"Show type\" to \"Browsed by an individual (window)\".\n\n\nThis will put the presentation into a window, which you can maximize on the presenting screen (for me the 2nd display hooked up).  Yes you get the title bar, but otherwise it's effectively full screen.  On the primary display (which is still my laptop screen), I can move to different applications without affecting the windowed presentation screen.\n\nA: Per @DanBeale's suggestion: The way I have seen a presenter switch to an application away from PowerPoint without being displayed on the presentation video output is to do it on a separate screen when you extend your desktop via a projector. This is the same behavior you see on a MacBook when you extend your desktop via an external monitor. \nIn other words, I do not think that what you are looking for is a PowerPoint feature per se. This behavior should be similar in Windows as well. \nFor example: Whenever I attach my MacBook to an external video source, say a Vizio television, I typically end up using Apple's mini-DVI to VGA adapter. Using the MacBook's video output port brings up additional options in the Display settings in System Preferences. If I choose to extend my desktop rather than mirror it, then I can use the Vizio television to display anything I want (PowerPoint, Keynote, Hulu over Safari, etc). As I do this, the MacBook's own screen remains free for me to use any way I see fit. This screen is not shown via the television. \nYou can achieve the same results using a projector rather than a television. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Use Command + Option + D to bring up your apple dock at any time...just be sure you have the applications you want to access on your dock. Suggest before you go into slide show presentation mode that you bring up the doc on whichever monitor the participants won't be seeing and leave it there before launching the slides. Once the slides are showing you can access your other applications without participants seeing on the other monitor * for example, presenters view * via your dock. \n\nA: I got it to work by going to the slide show tab and then going to set up slide show and choosing the Browsed by an individual option, this does put the slide show into a window though, but you can then do whatever on the other screen.\n\nA: Thanks all.

Within Keynote's preferences, be sure the box for \"Allow Expose, Dashboard, and others to use the screen.\" Next, set up Mission Control (formerly known as Spaces) do have your Keynote window on Desktop-1 and your other application's window on Desktop-2. Now hit \"Play\". At any point during the presentation, press \"F\" (to pause the slide show); Command-2 (to switch to your alternate application); Command-1 (to switch back to Keynote); and Space Bar (to resume). Your clients will see only one slide for the duration, and will not see anything you are doing on virtual Desktop-2.\n\nA: If you follow this tutorial it will show you how to mirror the displays which is not what you want.

Lu's solution is the only thing I see that accomplishes what Windows PPT 2010 does out of the box:  Allow you to show a PPT slideshow on an external screen while you do something else on your primary (MacBook screen).\nIn Windows, you can \"setup show\" to display the slides on whatever screen you like and then when you enter slideshow mode only the screen you have designated is used for the slides while your other screen can be used for whatever you like.  Of course when you click Page down to advance the slides, PPT (specifically the PPT slideshow) has to have Windows Focus.\nThere is an option in PowerPoint preferences -> View that says 'always mirror displays when switching to another view or application' - I found that unchecking that kept the very bizarre behavior of my entire Mac desktop being set to mirrored when I used Command-Tab to switch from PPT while in slideshow (with the obligatory presenter view running).\nAnyone know how to advance slides manually when in \"Browse at a kiosk (full screen)\" mode?\nI suggest everyone visit Microsoft's Office for Mac page and provide feedback on this - we need a third \"old school\" option in the \"Settings for two displays\" ribbon!!\n\nA: You can use presenter view but use CMD-Tab to switch between programs on the Mac.\n", "Q: Hibernate MacBook on 10-ish % power instead of 0/1% when running on battery? Yeah, I know my battery is probably hosed, but every time I reach 5%, my MacBook shuts down, as it expects the battery to be able to run down to 1% before hibernating.\nHowever I would like it to hibernate and not shutdown, when I run out of power, so is it possible to make my MacBook hibernate at like 5-10%?\nMy MacBook is over 2 years old and I'm not going to buy a new battery. The battery only lasts 1-2 hours.\nI have tried calibrating the battery, resetting the SMC etc., without any noticeable effect.\n\nA: http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html will let you control it via GUI. The app is $6 on his website or $4 on the Mac App Store.\n\n(Note: I have no idea how this app ever got approved for the Mac App Store, but it appears that Apple is stone-walling the developer on approving a Lion-compatible update. This seems to be Apple's passive-aggressive way of getting apps out of the Mac App Store after they were approved: they don't want to upset people by yanking the app, so they just won't approve an update and eventually it either breaks and the developer pulls the app because they are getting so many support requests, or people just stop buying it. When the sandboxing rules hit in November, we may see apps start disappearing from the Mac App Store. All of which is to say that if I was going to buy this app, I'd buy it through his website even though it's $2 more. There's a demo available, although the \"request a trial\" button didn't work for me, I assume it's a temporary glitch that the developer can fix. It also appears that Mac App Store customers can download the version from his website and use that, so if those $2 are really important to you, I guess you could try that.)\n\nIf you'd rather spend time than money, http://tidbits.com/article/9115 has a script that might help.\n\nA: If you purchase or try the demo version of TinkerTool System (and make sure that it is \"system\", TinkerTool alone won't do it), there is a setting to enable or disable \"Safe Sleep,\" which automatically hibernates the laptop every time it enters sleep.

If I have an OS X Address Book group of people I want to email periodic updates to, and I want to send that list to a second person who wants to email updates to this group as well, how can I do that?\nIf I drag the group to a Mail.app message and send that to my friend, they can open it and import all those contacts into Mail.app... however, it does not import the group, just the people. Since we know some of the same people, my friend will have some of the people from this group already in her address book. If she does and she chooses to not update her cards with my cards, then they won't even show up under \"Last Import\".\nHow can you email an address book group to another Mac user so that it shows as a group in their address book?\n\nA: Without some sort of mailing list software, I'm not sure you'll really get the functionality you want.\nAs a workaround I would try setting up a custom tag, using an existing unused field, or something in Notes, and then creating a Smart Ground around that.\nFor example, all the contacts you want in your group, put 'mailing list' into their notes. Then create a SmartGroup to show those contacts.\nSend the contacts to your friend, and they can import and merge the data. If they setup the same smart group, you should have the same contacts, with the same info, in that group.\nThe other option would be to stop her importing anything, and just use a Shared Addressbook, and maintain everything there. Google, Exchange, LDAP etc will let you use a remote address book, that isn't automatically synced to your local address book, but all contacts are accessibly, so you can both use that. In the groups page of the address book you'll see your local contacts, and remote contacts as distinct lists. Then, you'll just know to send to everyone in that shared address book.\n\nA: I just discovered that this is possible in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion... and after testing further I discovered it's possible in Mac OS X 10.6.8 also. I'm not sure if this works in earlier versions, but here are the steps to make this happen:\nFor the sender:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Group in Address Book either using the File > New Group menu item, or by clicking the + button on the Groups panel:\n\n\n\n*Click on All Contacts to view all your contacts. Find the contacts you want to add to the list and drag and drop them from the list of contacts on the right to the new list you created on the left.\n\n\n\n*Once you have added all the contacts to your new group you need to send the list to your friend. You can create a new email message and drag the name of the group from the list in Address Book and drop it on a the email message to send the list. Or, you can select the group and use the File > Export > Export vCard... menu item to export the list, and attach the resulting file to an email.\nFor the recipient:\nThe key to making this work is to create a new group first and then dropping the vCard on that group.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new group in the OS X Address book, just like in step #1 for the sender, using either using the File > New Group menu item, or by clicking the + button on the Groups panel:\n\n\n\n*Drag and drop the vCard file sent to you on the new group which you created. Make sure the new list \"lights up\" as shown below:\n\n\n\n*You will be asked if you want to import the new cards. **If you are told there are duplicates, click \"Review Duplicates\". If you are not told there are duplicates, click \"Import\" and skip the next step.\n\n\n*If you have duplicates to review, Select the \"Keep Both\" option, and then click \"Apply to All\" (if that option appears). This will create duplicates in your address book, meaning your original contacts will not be altered and you can delete your friend's copies later if you want to. The new group you created will be an easy way to find the new duplicates should you want to delete them later.\n\n\n*You now have a copy of your friends list added to your address book, without altering any of your cards. You can compose emails to this entire group (remember to use BCC!) if you want.\nIf you want to delete the list (and the duplicates) later, you can select the group on the left and press the delete key on your keyboard. You are then presented with the option to delete the actual cards as well as the group, which will remove any duplicates you might have created in the previous step:\n\n", "Q: Battery life not like advertised on new MacBook Pro I bought a MacBook Pro 15.4\" in September and the battery life is nothing like what is advertised. I'm struggling to get 4 hours out of it with wifi off and Ethernet as my network connection. The spec I choose wasn't the best, either: it only has the 2.2GHz Core i7 with the better graphics card model, no other additions. \nI bought it because of its great battery life, I've tried turning screen brightness down and the keyboard backlight off and still nothing. I am mainly using it to type up lecture notes in the lecture so I am running it off battery power only using Word and PowerPoint. Should I be concerned and take it back to Apple? I know the Core i7 is power hungary but, still, this is ridiculous as it's less than a month old – I was expecting to be able to use it for a full day without the battery dying.\n\nA: Get a program like gfxCardStatus to monitor which graphics card is in use, and watch out for Flash or other processor-hungry apps in the background. \nEverything @bmike said in his comment is correct, too.\n\nA: I would recommend performing a battery calibration.  For various reasons, Macs tend to lose their ability the gauge the actual amount of battery charge remaining.  Battery calibration re-teaches the system how to measure its battery life, sometimes making a significant difference.  In any case, it's free to do, and is also good to do every now and again.\nYour computer may be fairly new, but the battery could be many months old and may not have been stored or traveled in the most ideal of conditions (extreme heat, cold, moisture) on its way from the factory to you, which could have had an effect on its \"calibration\".  This may or may not make a big difference for you, but it doesn't hurt to try.\nInfo for performing a battery calibration can be found at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1490.\nFor your model, this would involve:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charging battery to 100%.\n\n*Leaving computer on and awake, disconnect power.\n\n*Keeping the computer on and awake, run down battery until computer shuts itself off.  You can use the computer during this time.**\n\n*After computer has gone to sleep, leave it alone for at least 5 hours (I usually leave it overnight.)\n\n*Reconnected charger, and leave connected until fully charged.\n**Caffiene is a great free program for overriding your Mac's power settings, and keeping it awake.\n", "Q: Don't require a password when waking Is there a way to not require a password when I wake my MBA (open the lid)?

I'm looking for an iPad app that I can use for my PDF presentations.  The absolute must-have features are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Good annotation support.\nI'm giving 2hr lectures so I have to be able to write on the presentation in response to the students' questions, or to highlight something that I want the students to take particular note of.\n\n*No annoying page transitions.\nSince the presentation is a PDF, incrementing information on a slide is actually handled by having a whole new page which is almost a copy of the previous one.  So when changing pages, the students' attention has to be on what just changed on the slide, not on some fancy page turning or sliding feature.\nGoodReader has the second feature, but it's annotation support is somewhat limited.  In particular, freehand writing is difficult.\nThere are many PDF annotation apps that have the first, but I've yet to find one that has (almost) no page transitions.  I had found eNote Taker which was acceptable (there's a slight blurring of the image on changing, but that's alright), but today it got upgraded to GoodNotes and now page turning is done by sliding (I have emailed GoodNotes to ask them to fix this, but my next lecture is tomorrow morning so even if they agree it's unlikely that it'll be fixed in time).\nSo my question: is there an iPad annotation tool without annoying page transitions?\nUnfortunately, none of the reviews that I've found mention page transitions so I've been reduced to watching interminable youtube videos to try to see the transitions (that's how I found eNote Taker).\n(I hope that this is an acceptable question; I've tried to make it non-subjective and with a clear potential answer.  However, I'm not a frequent user of this site, so if it is not acceptable, I apologise in advance.)\n\nA: With a little hunting around, watching videos, and emailing developers, I've come up with the following list.\n\n\n*\n\n*iAnnotate.  This has good annotation (obviously) and when connected to an external display then the display version has no page transitions (note that there are transitions on the iPad display, though they rate very low on my \"irritatometer\").  Other pluses: customisable toolbars, and the presentation display doesn't show the toolbars or menus.\nThere is a slight oddity: even though the presentation display doesn't show the toolbars, the size of the document depends a bit on what toolbars are on display on the iPad.\n\n*2screens.  The focus of this is on the presentation, which it does extremely well.  The annotation works in a slightly different way to other apps.  Imagine a glass sheet in front of the presentation and that you are writing on that, not on the presentation itself.  Once you get used to that (so saving and blanking the annotations when shifting slides, I've been told that the developers are working on making this automatic) then it works well.  The presentation part is very nice, with none of the menus displayed on the external dispay.\n\n*Explain Everything.  This is, perhaps, a slightly surprising contender as it is really for recording a short presentation (or other).  But it can also be used for the presentation itself and has annotation support.  The external display mirrors the iPad display, but there is a \"minimal\" toolbar which is very discrete and contains all the main presentation controls.  The only snag with this one is that there is a strange offset with the PDFs that I use (created by xelatex) which means that the slides get successively more out of sync with the backgrounds.  The developers tell me that this depends on the PDF so other methods of PDF-generation may not have this problem (and I'm hopeful that it would be possible to post-process the PDF from xelatex so that it works as well).\n\n*GoodNotes (formerly eNote Taker).  This has a little history!  When it was eNote Taker then it worked just fine.  In the upgrade to GoodNotes, sliding page transitions were introduced.  In the current version, tapping on the screen changes pages without the sliding transition so it is usable again.  The display mirrors the iPad display, but the annotation toolbars are very discreet in that they collapse out of the way when not being used.\n", "Q: Not able to copy files to another Mac in the network via AFP I have an iMac and an MBP connected to the same network and I want to transfer files from one machine to the other.

Your best solution is to go to an Apple Store to get it looked at.\n\nA: You could upgrade to Lion, as the behaviour for extended key presses has changed.  If I hold down the C key instead of giving me the old \"cccccccc\" etc thing, it provides a small popover menu thing to allow me to select alternative accented letter \"c\"s, like this ç/ć/č and so on.  You select them by clicking or hitting the associated number that is listed under them.  Alternatively if you just ignore it, and then press another key (so long as it is not 1/2/3 etc or a number that associated with one of the accented characters) it will cancel the while thing and just let you type normally.

So if there's an issue with your ISP's DNS servers, it could be slowing down your web browsing without affecting your large transfer speeds.\nTry switching your DNS to use the Google Public DNS servers. Open up the Network pane in System Preferences, select your wifi and click Advanced…. Then go to the DNS tab, and enter in 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, as shown in the screencap:\n\nMake sure those entries are above anything else in there.\nIt may be another issue, but this is a good starting point.\n\nA: Increasingly ISPs are hijacking DNS traffic.  You can put any ip address you want into your preferences, and it will be captured at their gateway and redirected to their own server.\nA partial answer is to run pdnsd on your local machine.  Give it a large cache, and set it ignore time to live that are under 24 hours.  This will reduce the number of dnslookups you have to do.\nOn applying this to my home network (4 computers a 2 Mbit down, 500 kbit up, satellite link=high latency) doing this made the network FAR mroe spritely.\nThe second solution is to buy a share of a better connected host that offers VPN services.  A friend did this and found that even with the overhead of encryption it was still faster by a factor of 3.\n", "Q: Matlab on the command line error in Lion I constantly get this warning in Matlab, which I run on the command line:\n\nThis process is attempting to exclude an item from Time Machine by path without administrator privileges.

This should be so straightforward but it's not working for me. I've followed Agile Bit's help guide for setting up a new Mac but it's not working.\nI have 1Password installed on one machine. It's completely populated with passwords and a master password on the agile keychain as been set. The keychain is stored in ~/Dropbox. The Dropbox sync occurred and I can see the same keychain file on my other Mac. MD5 checksums match on the files.\nWhen I go to setup 1Password on the new Mac I have two choices when I first run it:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am a new user\n\n*I have already used 1Password\n\n\nIf I take choice 2 I get a file finder window. I navigate to ~/Dropbox and select my agile keychain file. 1Password flashes a loading dialog window and then...nothing. It doesn't show me the Master Login window. Command 0 doesn't bring up the window. I can go to 1Password -> Unlock... and it will give me a small dialog window asking for the Master Password, but the password I used for that agile keychain gets rejected. I just keep getting recycled back to enter password dialog box.\nIf I take choice 1 I get the option to find information from a previous install. Again, I navigated to that agile keychain in ~/Dropbox. Again, 1Password does some quick loading and then...nothing. Same story as above.\nBoth of those actions above could conform to what the Agile Bit's documentation says for setting up a new machine and using an existing, sync'ed agile keychain. Neither of them work.\nI hesitate to fill out a new profile on the new machine because I don't want to over write my existing agile keychain file and all the passwords in it.\nHow exactly am I supposed to setup this second machine with the shared agile keychain?\n\nA: I had this exact problem over and over, with some help from Agile I found the answer here: http://help.agile.ws/1Password3/configure_dropbox_on_mac.html\nHere is the important part:\n\nTo configure 1Password on your other Macs, first setup Dropbox, then\nmake sure you have the latest version of 1Password installed and\nrunning.\nLocate your 1Password.agilekeychain file in your Dropbox\nfolder. If it has a green check mark badge indicating that the sync is\ncomplete, double click it,\nand 1Password will confirm that you want to\nuse this new location. Important If it shows the blue syncing badge\nrather than the green check mark badge, wait until the badge is a\ngreen check mark before opening the file. Failure to do so could\nresult in data corruption.\n\n\nA: I have experienced similar behavior in the past whenever I am running different versions of 1Password on different devices. The 1Password team at AgileBits is very fast at producing multiple updates to their product (which is great!), but they will sometimes update the software in a way that the AgileKeychain file will be only accessible by the latest version of 1Password. \nIn other words, make sure that you are running the latest version of 1Password in all of your Macs and/or iOS devices and try again. You seem to be following the instructions the correct way. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Did a little Console diving and figured it out.\nSo the right approach is to take the second option (I'm already a user) and select the .agilekeypass file in your Dropbox. But in my case this was failing because 1Password was unable to start the 1Password Helper application. There were error messages about this in the Console, but unfortunately no user-visible feedback about the problem was given by the 1Password application on the desktop.\nI ran a repair of permissions on my disk and that sorted everything out. I was able to setup 1Password on the second machine, pointing it at the Dropbox-based .agilekeychain file so everything stays in sync.\n", "Q: VMWare Fusion on Main drive or Firewire 800 drive? I have been running VMWare Fusion (4.0 now) for a long time, but off the main MacBook Pro hard drive.\nWill I get faster overall performance of the VM/Mac if I put the VM on an external Firewire 800 drive?\n\nA: In general, you could expect the Mac to get slightly faster and the VM to get slightly slower. However, depending on how much paging you were doing and how much disk access the VM does, it could be that the VM would get faster. The VM certainly won't get all that much slower, if any.\n", "Q: Why does a network volume have a \"-1\" at the end after upgrading to Lion? I have a USB hard drive attached to an Airport Extreme called \"Webb Family Network Storage.\"\nAfter upgrading to Lion, about 50% of the time, this volume will mount with a \"-1\" on the end, showing up as \"/Volumes/Nic's Airport Extreme/Webb Family Network Storage-1/\"\nNormally this wouldn't be a huge deal, but a few apps that use Java or Air that interact directly with the paths (such as Eye-Fi's Upload Center or CrashPlan) will detect that the volume is missing and I'll either have to re-configure them to use the new \"-1\" path or reboot the machine and hope that it connects using the \"old\" path.\nIs there a workaround for this? Some sort of cache I can clear?\n\nA: When the drive is ejected, does the directory /Volumes/Nic's Airport Extreme/Webb Family Network Storage/ exist? If so, move it to the desktop (so you save any contents, if any) and reboot. \n", "Q: Line select for modification I have used Microsoft Windows for 15+ years and am a highly keyboard-centric user. My wife uses both iMac and MacBook Pro, which means a full keyboard and a MacBook keyboard. Occasionally, I use her computers to see if I can migrate to Apple world. Web-surfing and video-watching are okay, but I find myself stressed by using MacBook keyboards and Mac when I work. Please teach me how I can do the following jobs or solve these problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Home, End : When I edit text (like in MS Word) in Windows, I many times use Shift+Home to select a line if I am at the end of the line, or Shift+End to select a line if I am at the beginning of the line. I am not with a Mac now so I can't remember, but I remember such a line-selecting resulted in a different result in Mac. I guess it went to the page top with Home. Can I change Mac keyboard setting so that I get the same behavior for line selection?\n\n*How can I do the above line selection task using a MacBook keyboard (with no visible home/end keys)?\n\nA: Lion now has the behavior you expect in #3. \nTo do line selection, use command and the left and right arrow keys. Add shift to select.\n(Command-left to replace Home, Command-right to replace End.)\n\nA: You select a line on a Mac by holding ⌘, Shift (to start the selection), and ← or →.\nPlease ask your last question in a separate thread because it differs significantly.\nThis will allow community to benefit from a searchable question with a specific title.\n", "Q: If I have AT&T, will the iPhone 4S work in areas of CDMA coverage only? The new iPhone 4S has 2 antennas: both GSM and CDMA. Is there a chance that if I, who am an AT&T customer, buy one of these, that I would be able to use it in areas that are CDMA only? AT&T is GSM only. I have two locations out of town that I frequently visit that have ZERO GSM / AT&T coverage, but get full coverage to Verizon and US Cellular, both CDMA networks. \n\nA: No. CDMA will only work of you buy and activate your 4S device onto a CDMA carrier. \nThe FAQ shows that when you activate the phone it will choose one technology for coverage in country. GSM Registered phones will roam on GSM as will CDMA phones. Sprint should work in 35 unnamed countries and Verizon in 40 at launch.\n", "Q: activating screen sharing remotely There is a computer I don't have immediate access to that I cannot screenshare with it. I have an account on the computer and have screenshared before with it. \nI believe some setting has been changed to deactivate screensharing. \nIs there a way to activate screensharing through ssh?\nMy computer is OS 10.6.8. I'm not sure what the other one is but probably the same.\n\nA: To enable remote management (including screensharing), issue the following command over ssh:  \nNote: This command sets your vnc password to 'mypasswd' as set by the -vncpw flag in the command, you should change this.\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw mypasswd -restart -agent -privs -all\n\n\nTo disable the remote management, issue the following command over ssh:\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -configure -access -off\n\n", "Q: Access Mac mini remotely (Screen Sharing + File System) I have a Mac Mini connected to a Time Capsule (connected to a DSL modem, getting a new external IP address every 24 hours).\nAny recommendation on how to access the Mac mini remotely (both file system and screen sharing) when I am not at home? (Also it would be nice to have a solution that works with Wake on LAN, so that the Mac mini can be asleep when not in use)?\nScreen Sharing and file sharing works perfectly fine from within the network but I am not sure what's needed to access it externally. What are my options?\n\nA: You need to configure port-forwarding on your Time Capsule.  Since your ISP doesn't give you a static IP address, then you will need a dynamic-DNS service to resolve your home's IP address to a URL which you will use when you're away from home to connect to your Mac Mini.  You'll also need to configure your Time Capsule to handle Wake-On-LAN/Wake-On-Demand packets.  In the bullet points below I've listed the basic requirements and included links to step-by-step instructions for each step.  \n\n\n*\n\n*You need a static IP address from your ISP or a dynamic DNS service like dyndns.com to resolve a changing IP address from a URL which you can choose.\n\n*You need to setup Wake-On-Demand as described by Apple on your Time Capsule\n\n*Finally, you need to forward ports on your Time Capsule to your Mac Mini so that incoming connections from your client software when you're away from home can reach your Mac Mini.\n\n\nA: Currently using https://secure.logmein.com/products/free/, free account and a free iPad app that works quite nicely.... no port forwarding as it registers the app with their website.\n\nA: As an alternative to a dynamic-dns service  Griffo suggested, you could use IP Observer. Leave it running on your mac-mini and It will email you when your address changes. \n\nA: I use sharetool. It works quite well for remotely connecting to bonjour services.\nhttp://www.yazsoft.com/products/sharetool/ \n\nA: Also, to see/control your computer via VNC, you'll need a client on your machine to see the computer at home. Chicken of the VNC is a solid enough client. The most commonly used port for VNC is 5900 (for your port forwarding). You'll also need to go into System Preferences and configure your machine through the Sharing preferences panel. This screencast is a dated but good and relevant reference. There are a few options for the configuration, so be sure to read carefully.   \n", "Q: Will reinstalling Lion erase all my documents and applications? I am planning to reinstall my operating system because it has many glitches. However, I am totally new to this and I would like to ask you what actually happens when you reinstall Lion? Do all your files remain or not?\n\nA: Lion does not offer any customizations during the installation process. Thus a reinstallation is about as smooth and as linear as possible.\nYou restart your Mac holding the OPTION key when you hear the tone. You will then be greeted with various partitions you can use instead of the main Lion partition.\n\nShould you wish to simply reinstall Lion, you would select the Recovery HD partition. Once loaded, you just need to follow the prompts and install it over your current Lion installation.\nThe new installation will replace all the core system files, but leave your user profile and data complete untouched. Your music, documents, even passwords and bookmarks, and applications will not touched; none of your personal information will be deleted (nor will it backup your old system, as was common in older OS X versions). It is a seamless process that simply rolls Lion back to the default installation build. There will be nothing lost and no disk spaced wasted on old system files.\nYou can read about the process over at Apple.\nNote: It was the case that older builds of OS X allowed various types of reinstallations (like Archive and Install or a complete erase), but these have been omitted in Lion, greatly simplifying the process.\n\nA: Lion doesn't offer the different kinds of installs that previous versions of the OS did. If you use the Lion installer, you will perform an \"Upgrade\" install that keeps your files and programs intact. It's still always a good idea to back up your data before upgrading.\nIf you need to perform a clean install, MacWorld offers advice, but it's not an option in the installer as in previous versions of the OS.\nSource: http://www.macworld.com/article/161065/2011/07/installing_lion_what_you_need_to_know.html\n\nA: (Pre-Lion-specific answer)\nIt depends on which install option you choose: \"Archive and Install\" and \"Upgrade\" will keep your user files. \"Erase and Install\" will not. Not all options are available depending on the OS currently installed and the one you wish to install.\nIf you're installing newer over older (10.6 over 10.5, or 10.6.8 over 10.6.0), you'll have all the options. If you're installing older over newer or the same version (10.5 over 10.6 or 10.6 over 10.6), you probably won't have the \"Upgrade\" option, just \"Archive and Install\" and \"Erase and Install\".\n", "Q: When I shake my MacBook Pro it makes a strange noise. I have bought brand new MacBook pro 15-inch model with highest specifications in this June. I have also installed newest Mac OS, Lion.\nNow I have a small problem (or maybe not) here. I would like to ask you what could be possible wrong that when I shake my MacBook Pro it makes a strange noise? Maybe it is just the noise of the keys on the keyboard?\n\nA: The only thing I can think of that would be shaking is a loose screw.  I'd recommend taking it to an Authorized Apple Service Provider to have them poke around and see if they can get it out.  If you are daring enough (or out of warranty), you might want to try it yourself.\n\nA: Some hard disk mechanisms have a loose component (I'm not sure what) that can be heard to move when the drive is moved. You'll see words like \"Rattle Sound Is Normal\" on the drive label. Maybe that's what you're hearing?\n", "Q: iOS5 - \"“Remind me to call Mum when I get home.” - How does it know when you're home? One of the features of SIRI showed the instruction:\n“Remind me to call Mum when I get home.”\nMy question is - how does it know when you'll be home? Or is there a location based trigger for tasks?\n\nA: You've got it exactly right.\nIn the video, the person had set up the phone to recognize 'home' as a specific address. iOS 5 uses its location features to determine when you arrive at the address of 'home' and alerts you when you do.\nThis feature can also be used to trigger alerts when you leave a place: \"Remind me to pick up the groceries when I leave work.\"\n", "Q: How can I find the owner of an obstinate iPhone? So, I have this iphone that my parents found. I need some advice on how to find the owner. It's a puzzler though.\nIt was dead and I'm an android user so I couldn't power it up to find the owners info. So, I took it to the Apple store assuming that since I thought Apple was all about service, they would just take care of it.\nNo such luck. They said they couldn't help me. They did let me charge it up though. Might I point out that it's really stupid how long you have to wait for usability when plugging in a dead iPhone.\nAnyway, when it finally became usable (20 minutes of standing foolishly in the Apple store later), it immediately popped up a little message saying it had no sim installed and when touched it just displayed a lock screen. The store employee told me there was nothing that could be done with that except a wipe.\nI doubt a carrier would be helpful since there is no sim. I was under the impression that the sim couldn't be removed from an iphone though. Is that inaccurate?\nAnyway, it also said the date was December 31st and my parents just found it a little over a week ago so I'm assuming it was sitting in that location for quite some time, which isn't all that surprising considering where it was. I guess maybe the clock isn't updating due to the lack of a sim... Just a guess though.\nSo now the only thing I really have to link it to it's original owner is the background pic on the phone which isn't much to go on at all. ;) Especially since it's half covered by the missing sim message.\nAny ideas? You would think in this connected world that this wouldn't be that hard. Unfortunately I think it might be.\n\nA: Your best bet is to just place an ad on Craigslist and in the paper in the lost and found sections. If someone tries to claim the phone, have them identify the picture on the lock screen. \nI used to work at an Apple Store Genius Bar. We were not allowed to give out any information from our system ever. If you're located in the US and the phone has a SIM, it probably has AT&T as a carrier. They will not be able to give you any info on the phone either. \nJust to provide some insight as far as why Apple can't help you contact the whoever might be listed in their system, remember that a computer or iPhone is a transferrable device. We would frequently have customers bring in a device for repair that was purchased secondhand and the original owner's information was still in our system. \nLet's say Tommy buys a MacBook Pro and registers it. Later, Tommy sells his MacBook Pro to Kate because he's broke. Kate purchases the MacBook Pro but does not update the registration. A month later, she leaves the computer in an airport and you find it. You take it to the Apple store and they say, \"Oh, here is all of Tommy's info. We'll just call up Tommy and he can come get his MacBook back.\"\nTommy is not a very scrupulous person, and he fails to mention that he sold the MacBook Pro a month ago. He comes and picks it up and now he has Kate's money and his old computer back. Sweet deal, right? So you can see why this isn't something that Apple would be willing to do.\nThe Apple employee you talked to was not trying to be obstructive when he wouldn't help you out, but there's a lot of liability things at stake here. They were pretty committed to the idea of protecting customer data, sometimes to the point of idiocy when I worked there, so they're pretty much a dead end as far as returning the phone.\n\nA: I'm not sure why you can't just press the \"OK\" button under the No SIM message.\nIf there's no passcode go into > Settings > General > About you can view the phone's IMEI.\nIf the owner has reported it missing to the police they should be able to reference the IMEI (their cell carrier should hold that info if the owner doesn't have it themselves.)\nSo far I'm guessing you haven't contacted the police, I'd recommend you turn it into the police station nearest the location your parents found it.\n\nA: You can use this page on Apples website to find out what version the phone is, and what carrier it was using if you are in the US due to verizion and ADT using separate cellular networks.\nYou could then hand it into to the network provider.\nFailing that you should hand it in to the nearest police station to where it was found.\n\nA: \n@cksum It's company policy at Apple to not provide customer\n  information, regardless of the stated intent by the person requesting\n  it.\n\nThe best one can do is put out an ad about the phone being lost with some identifiable information from the phone (ie. serial number off the SIM tray). iPhones also do not take 20 minutes to charge under normal operating health, so there may be some damage or it could be age. At this point, it's your call what to do with it. If no one claims it, it is ultimately yours.\n\nA: Pop the sim out, and see if there is one. Take that to a cell carrier, and see if they can help.\nIf you're in the US, and it's Verizon, then no luck there.\nDepends somewhat on which country you're in, but I suspect the carrier might have more info than Apple. Apple just sells the device. The carriers have to maintain the contract.\n", "Q: Customizing Finder like Windows File Explorer I am migrating from Windows to Mac OS X. I really like Windows file explorer. In the left panel, a tree of folders shows up, and in the right panel, files show up.

I think I was able to adjust the column length, but I want to see long file names without adjusting it and when I save as a new file name inside software like MS Word.\nIs there any workaround to make Finder look like what I want? (1) a tree of folders, and (2) long file names without showing any other file information column.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to List View.\n\n*Control-click on the bar that says \"Name  Date Modified  Size  \" etc.\n\n*Uncheck all the fields (Date modified, Size, Kind, etc.)\n\n\nYou should now have long filenames and expandable folders.\n", "Q: Folder copy without losing any existing files \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy does “Copy” replace stuff instead of merging it? \n\nIn Windows, if I overwrite a folder abc/doc to def/doc, (1) files existing in abc/doc but not in def/doc are simply added to def/doc; (2) files existing in def/doc but not in abc/doc do not change; and (3) files existing in both folders are replaced. But in Mac, all files in def/doc are deleted and files in abc/doc are copied. I am not talking about which should be the more correct behavior, but was wondering if Mac can be tuned to how Windows behave, because I am more comfortable with such behavior.\nI found that Lion now behaves just like Windows, but in Snow Leopard or older version, how can I make Mac OS behave like what I described?\n\nA: The short answer is that you cannot accomplish this using the Finder.

General screen color picker can not perfectly pick the exact color value in a PNG image, for example, alpha channel is missing.\n\nA: DigitalColor Meter (found in /Applications/Utilities) tells you the colour value (RGB) of the pixel your cursor is hovering over.\n\nA: Using ImageMagick:\n$ convert image.png -crop '1x1+100+200' txt:-\nOutputs, e.g.\n# ImageMagick pixel enumeration: 1,1,255,rgb\n0,0: (236,236,236)  #ECECEC  rgb(236,236,236)\nOr, if the file is PNG-24 file, it outputs e.g.\n# ImageMagick pixel enumeration: 1,1,255,rgba\n0,0: (  0,  0,  0,243)  #000000F3  rgba(0,0,0,0.952941)\n\nAt -crop option I've first defined the area to be cropped, which in this case is 1x1 pixels. Then I've defined the location of the crop relative to the North West corner, i.e. upper left.†\nLastly I've converted the output to textual with txt:-. ImageMagick then outputs all the colors of the image to STDOUT (in this case there is only one color, as the image size is 1 pixel), meaning you could process it with normal shell techniques. So e.g. by piping the output to tail -n 1 you would get only the pixel info line.\nIf you need the pixel's color in any other colorspace, you should look at the aptly named -colorspace option.\n†) Actually the location is relative to the specified -gravity value, but it defaults to \"NorthWest\".\n\nA: I found a feasible way on Stack Overflow by Roman Nurik:\n\nIn Photoshop's Info panel, you can choose 'Opacity' as a readout mode, though it will show up as a percentage and not as a real alpha value.\nTo enable it, simply open the Info window, choose Panel Options and then set the Second Color Readout mode to Opacity.\n\n… But you need Photoshop for this. I still believe there should be simpler ways. Hope someone else can help.\n\nA: If you don't have Photoshop, and don't want to spend the bucks just to get that feature, the FOSS (Free / Open Source Software) app GIMP will do the job for you.\nwww.gimp.org\n\nA: colorhunter.com is what i managed to find while googling this same question. good luck\n", "Q: Why is Siri iPhone 4S only? Seems odd to me that the Siri assistant feature would be available only for the iPhone 4S. I have the Siri app (from the company Apple bought and integrated into the OS) running on my 3GS and it works just fine. So what gives? It surely isn't hardware. Then what? Just to move more 4S units?\n\nA: It's supposed to use the phone's processor to do the voice recognition instead of sending the recording to the cloud to recognize as the Siri app does. This (apparently) requires the A5 processor.\nIt probably doesn't hurt, though, that it'll push 4S units.\n\nA: The other theory I've heard is that voice recognition and text-to-speech takes up a lot of RAM, and coupled with the suggestion from a couple of tech writers who got some hands on time{1} that the 4S actually has 1GB of RAM, it makes some sense.\nIt would also explain why the iPad 2 doesn't seem to be getting the Siri stuff, despite having the A5.\nAnd having it as a feature to push upgrades sure doesn't hurt either.\n{1} John Gruber from Daring Fireball on the 5by5 coverage of the event and Josh Topolsky from This is My Next\n", "Q: Out of disk space when restoring iPhone backup from iTunes Trying to restore an iPhone backup I took tonight, but can't because when it tries, the startup disk runs out of space. I have other drives, but I can't remove anything else off of the startup disk.\nWhat can I do to restore this backup?\n\nA: You may want to consider using a utility like OmniDiskSweeper (free) or Daisy Disk ($20) to see if there aren't some unusually large files hiding somewhere, eating up disk space. You can find more apps like these in the answers to How can I free up some disk space?\nIf your disk is that full and you really can't remove anything else from the startup disk, I would definitely advise upgrading to a larger hard drive. It's generally recommended to keep about 15% of your disk free, and I would certainly advise against getting below 10 GB of free space on your startup disk. \nNot having enough disk space on your startup disk can easily cause severe performance problems and more frequent crashing — especially if you completely run out of space.\nOther than upgrading your hard drive, you could consider temporarily moving some larger files to another drive until you have enough room for the restore, then, after the restore has completed successfully, you could copy them back to the startup disk.\nDepending on what's taking up disk space, it may be worth looking into permanently moving some files to other drives. For example, iTunes and iPhoto libraries, which can often take up a lot of space, can be moved to other drives fairly easily.\n", "Q: is there a way to create an AFP link to point to any user's home directory?

That's not what I'm asking about.\nI'm interested in any way of using my iPad and iPhone/iPod touch side-by-side where the iPhone presents a menu of commands to control the iPad -- things like shortcuts, or better yet, buttons that invoke user-definable macros.\nDoes it exist?\nDoes the iPad have any way of being scripted through an API?\nNote: VNC is irrelevant to this question.\n\nA: It's possible to get your actual iPad screen and control it on your iPhone, but the iPad needs to be jailbroken. There's an always up to date guide of how to jailbreak at Lifehacker. \nOnce Cydia's been set up, tap Search and enter Veency. Choose the first option, then press Install and Confirm. When it's done, press Restart SpringBoard. \nAfter the restart, unlock your iPad and go to Settings. A new section called “Extensions” will appear in the list on the left; tap Veency under it.\nTurn on the Enabled switch if it isn't already, then enter a password in the box. If you don't enter a password, you will need to accept or decline every request to connect to your iPad. \nNow connect both the iPhone and iPad to the same Wi-Fi network. This is important because your connection will be slow over 3G. \nOn the iPad, open the Wi-Fi settings and then the arrow next to your Wi-Fi. Write down the IP address. \nGet your iPhone and download Mocha VNC from the App Store. Open it and set it up for your iPad's IP address and connect. Refer to its help page for more information. \nThe free version of Mocha VNC will let you type using the keyboard and tap the screen, but only the paid version will let you scroll up and down. \nWhen you're done, press the menu button at the bottom of your iPhone's screen, followed by Disconnect. On your iPad, go back to Settings and turn Veency off. This will prevent anyone from using your iPad over VNC without you knowing, as well as save a bit of battery life. \n\nA: You can use SSH, and you can create scripts to open applications, lock screen, etc, just using terminal console. As long I remember, there is a package in Cydia called Erica Utils, that come with necessary packages to do it. I searched a lot for a program used just for it as you are, but until that date I didnt find.\n", "Q: Quicksilver-like app for iPad? Quicksilver is a long-loved Mac app that gives you a single entry point, a command box, for performing a wide variety of actions on the Mac.  It is easily extensible and scriptable.  A similar app on Linux is Gnome Do.\nDoes anything like this exist for iPad? -- a universal commandline that's more useful than the built-in system search?\n\nA: No.  In short.\nThe longer answer:  All apps in iOS are sandboxed, meaning they effectively have no permission to do anything other than that which they were written for, other than through specific exceptions through API calls to other parts of the OS etc as allowed.  For example my Twitter app is allowed to access my contacts to use and set contact details as is deems fit.  Many apps (in my case Instagram,Tweetbot and Youtube) are allowed to send tweets through the Twitter App, but in all these cases (or any case where one app access some data or functionality provided by a second app) this is not a system wide availability.  Using said APIs an app can make portions of itself available to other apps, but unlike Quicksilver/Alfred/Launchbar on the Mac, this must explicitely be defined by the target app.  So taking for example the \"Due\" app for iOS which is a reminders app, it has an API that will allow other apps to create reminders in it, but that is all that other apps are allowed to do, and in order to do so they must be aware of the Due API.  As such the \"Agenda\" iOS calendar app has integrated the \"Due\" API, and is able to set a reminder in Due for an event created in Agenda.  But it cannot search for existing reminders in Due, or just start Due (or close it) etc.\nSo in order for an app like QS to exist on IOS, it would need to incorportate the API of every other app that it might want to connect to, and be limited by the fact that a) not every app (in fact I'd say very very few) actually has an API, and b) even where they do, they are often tied down to very specific functionality.\nA bit rambly, but I hope this answers your question.\n\nJust got an upvote on this, and re-read, and there is more the the answer than when I first made it.  There are a few apps these days that are trying to get closer to what the OP wanted, by effectively collecting and allowing the use of as many of these 3rd party APIs as possible in one place.  One such ass is Launch Center which collates APIs for nearly 50 apps, allowing you to do all sorts of actions from a single place - it's no quicksilver replacement, but it is an effective way to get at particular app functions directly rather than having to open the app and navigate to the function manually. - 1 example, is using clipboard contents for all sorts of things - tweet using clipboard contents, new task from clipboard contents etc etc.  Very useful.\n\nA: @stuffe very ably describes why no third party iOS app could behave the way Quicksilver does. That said, the Spotlight search is a very decent tool for the thing I use QS for 99% of the time: finding and launching apps. If swiping right from your home page and using the device's search tool isn't a regular practice for you, I recommend you try it out and see if it doesn't serve at least SOME of the purpose of QS.\nI have a whole folder structure on my iPad, all my apps live on one page. There are some that I know exactly where they are, but for the ones I don't use every day, I mostly get to them through Spotlight searches.\n\nA: I can recommend Launch Center Pro. It's designed for iPhone but works good on the iPad. And it's currently (June 2012) for sale at 40% off. \n", "Q: How to improve the iPhone battery? Hi all I was looking for a solution to prolong my battery life potential.\nIs there a replacement battery for iPhone that is more powerful than the one in-built when we bought it?\nOr is there an \"external battery\" that I can plug into my phone to increase the battery life potential?\n\nA: Yes, you can get external iPhone batteries.\nAmazon will have very many products.\n\nA: I normally try to turn off several items to improve the battery life on my iPhone. My 5's battery life was terrible but then shut off several items and now lasts for about a day & half between charges.\nTurn off the following: LTE, Wi-Fi, GPS (only on specific apps), dim display, bluetooth, 1 minute auto-lock screen conserves power, and if all else fails buy a car & office charger to get you through the day.\nHere is an article that goes more in depth about conserving battery. \n", "Q: Open Directory and \"Local\" Logins In the Windows server world, when you connect a computer to a Domain, you have the option of logging into the computer locally if there are local accounts. \nConsider this scenario:\nI have a Mac with a local admin username called \"localusername.\" I then set up the Mac to use the local Open Directory Master for logins. I then want to login to the Mac as \"localusername.\" \nIs that possible?\nHere's a second scenario:\nI have a Mac with a local admin username called \"spandex.\" I then set up the Mac to use the local Open Directory Master for logins. I then set up an Open Directory user with the username \"spandex.\" I then want to login to the Mac as the LOCAL instance of \"spandex.\" \nIs that possible?\nThanks to everyone!\n\nA: Are both scenarios possible? Yes, the local node doesn't go away after domain binding. The order in which the Mac looks at bound directory nodes for user accounts is shown graphically in Directory Utility, which can be found in /System/Library/CoreServices as of 10.6+.  You'll also notice that even if you set OD to be searched before the default/local node, if the directory is not available(or not cached) you'll login to the local spandex instead of OD's.\n", "Q: Is it possible to order a replacement key? The large   0   on my Apple keyboard (came with my 2008 Mac Mini) has fallen out, and upon my attempt to put it back in, a small but extremely vital plastic piece snapped off. Can I order a new key from Apple?\n\nA: I would try a local Apple Store or Mac repair shop. There's a good chance they have a few dead keyboards laying around that they'd be willing to give you a replacement key from.\n\nA: You can get replacement parts from apple vie telephone, genius bar or authorized repair centers. The small scissors from the aluminum keyboards are the same as the unibody portable keys, and if they don't have that exact piece you need (large keys generally are unique pieces) they can order a replacement keyboard. \n", "Q: Why are some backups grey and others purple in Time Machine in Lion? I started Time Machine for the first time in Lion (you know, to make sure everything was working properly), and I noticed something odd – on the timeline on the right side of the screen, some backups were purple and others were grey. There wasn't an apparent difference between the purples and greys to me, but I feel like I'm missing something obvious.\n\n\nA: I just recently noticed this, too, and discovered this Apple KB article: OS X Lion: About Time Machine's \"local snapshots\" on portable Macs\n\nWhen you enter the Time Machine browser (used to restore data), local\n  snapshots will appear on the timeline along with regular backups\n  distinguished by different colors.

How does it work? I heard it sends all your data off to the internet to be translated. But it seems like it's integrated into my phone.\nDoes it run on the phone or on the internet?\n\nA: Siri makes use of NLP(Natural Language Processing) - NLP computing takes significant resources and while the iPhone may be powerful enough to process them, it's likely to drain the battery. \nFor this reason, Siri application records your commands on your phone & sends it off the servers for processing. The results are returned back to the phone & does the commands. \nSo to answer, yes, it's part-phone, part-Internet service & it does send data to Apple's servers. \n\nA: It runs on both.  \nWhat Siri does requires multiple layers of processing, from audio processing, to mining huge databases, to speech synthesis, etc., and lots of other stuff in between and around.\nApple is shutting down the server component for the previous free Siri app, thus disabling that app.  This couldn't be done if all the processing was local.\n", "Q: \"Windows Date Format\" in Excel on Mac our internal software based on Zend throws Date Exception Errors for Excel Files from Mac Users.

I have many servers to manage and I don't want to use Terminal on my Mac to keep and manage server lists.\nI want to know if there is a secure shell client for Mac similar to Secure CRT on Windows?\n\nA: I'm a great fan of ZOC Terminal Emulator for MacOS.   \nIt has a host list, tabbed interface, very similar features (the two programs (ZOC and SecCRT) appear to copy-cat each other's features always within a few months).  Like SecureCRT it is commercial.\nSee also this question/answer on superuser (the guy there quotes someone saying it's the closest thing to SecureCRT).  User comments on MacUpdate are mostly favorable.\n.\n\n\nA: How about SecureCRT for Mac? http://www.vandyke.com/products/beta/securecrt/mac_osx.html\n\nA: I use iTerm2 in the way I used to use SecureCRT. In particular, if you set up profiles then you can pick machines off a list and have a single button click / hotkey open up a shell on the chosen remote machine. To set up a profile this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run iTerm2 and select Profiles / Open Profiles.\n\n*Click \"Edit Profiles\" to bring up the Preferences pane.\n\n*Click the + button in lower left to create a new profile.\n\n*Name your profile however you want, like the remote hostname.\n\n*Click the Command radio button, and set the command to ssh [hostname].\n\n*(Optional) configure other options for just this profile, like colors, terminal behavior, etc. You can also set a shortcut key.\n\n\nNow when you want to log in to your remote machine, just select Open Profiles (or press Cmd-O) and click your machine name. There are buttons to open the session in a new tab or new window.\nTechnically this is a little different than SecureCRT; it's not sshing directly from iTerm2, it creates a tty on your local machine first and runs the ssh command in it. That design is harmless and in many ways a virtue; you get Keychain integration for your ssh credentials, for instance.\n\nA: What about Tagged Profiles of iTerm2?\n\nA: I haven't used it, but it looks like JellyfiSSH might do what you're looking for. $4 on the Mac App store. There's also SSHMenu which looks less polished, but you can get it for free if you want to compile it yourself, or $1 on the App store.\n", "Q: Force a link to open in Safari instead of the in-app browser I have an issue with QR Readers.

It was surprisingly hard to tell if my disk image was truly encrypted, or if it simply had the same name as an image that was previously encrypted.\nAs long as it had been mounted one time, Disk Utility did not show it as encrypted. Locking Keychain access did not help, it is as though OS X was caching encryption keys.\nI had to unmount the image, remove all references in Keychain Access, then try to mount it. Then I got asked for a password.\nOnce it's in a state where Mavericks requests a password, Disk Utility DID show the image file (not mounted image) as \"Not mounted, encrypted\".\nIf you dismount first, and are willing to use terminal, then as noted by Patrix and Stephen, hdiutil isencrypted {image-name} works with Mavericks.\n", "Q: What is the \"+\" mark at the end of file description? When I execute 'ls -al~', I see + marks, and it prevents me from moving/deleting files.\ndrwxr-xr-x+   5 prosseek  admin     170 Oct  5 03:43 Desktop\ndrwxr-xr-x+  17 prosseek  admin     578 Sep 25 22:20 Documents\n\nWhat is this, and how do I get this mark on every file and directory in my home directory? \nHow can I remove this? Is there any easy way to remove this on every file in my home directory?\n\nA: The + indicates the file has an Access Control List (ACL) with additional permissions. Each rule in an ACL is called an Access Control Entry (ACE).\nThe command ls -ale will show the ACEs for each file/folder that has an ACL\nThe default folders OS X creates when it makes a new home folder — Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Library, Movies, Music, Pictures, and Public — will have the ACE \n0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nwhich means no users are allowed to delete the folder, not even the owner of the folder. This prevents people from accidentally deleting these folders, which OS X expects to exist.\nTo remove all the ACLs from the default home folders, without affecting ACLs of their contents, use\nchmod -N ~/*\n\nTo remove an ACL from a folder and everything inside of it, use\nchmod -R -N /path/to/folder\n\nOnce the ACL has been removed, you can now delete those folder as expected, However, it's generally advisable to not remove the default folders that OS X  creates in a user's home folder. The OS and many apps expect those folders to be there. In fact, OS X may simply recreate some of them the next time you log in.\nAn alternative is to hide them from the Finder with\nchflags hidden /path/to/folder\n\nTo unhide, change hidden to nohidden. Hidden folders will still show up in Terminal, though.\n\nA: The plus means that there are extra permissions set on the file (using ACLs) that are more nuanced than can be expressed in the usual Unix rwxrwxrwx format.\nThese permissions can be edited in the Finder's Get Info window for the file.\n\nA: A + at the end means the folder has extended security information (such as an access control list). Try restoring permissions.\n", "Q: Apple iPhone 3GS Battery Problem So my iPhone is charged at 100% overnight, and when the battery gets to like 90%, the phone suddenly shuts off when I open an app like Facebook, Foursquare, Maps, etc... \nI try turning it back on and the Apple logo appears. When it gets to the lock screen, the battery is still showing 90% but then the phone decides to turn off again. I can turn it back on, and the same thing happens. Occasionally, it'll get past the lock screen, but after I launch an app, the phone decides to shut off again. After a couple of on/off cycles (the battery still showing >80%), the phone decides to give up and displays the low battery/plug into charger icon, even when it said it had 80% battery a minute ago.\nAnyone have the same problem and know a solution?\n\nA: The solution is likely to get the battery replaced.  By Apple or a qualified repair service.  \nLi-Ion batteries behave like this when the chemistry fails due to normal use or a premature fault.  The voltage can suddenly drops off a cliff, too fast for the battery charge indicator to show the decrease in percentage.\n", "Q: What can you do to speed up your iOS device? What things can you do to increase the speed of your iPhone / iPad / iPod Touch?\nIt appears that over time, the iPhone gets slower and slower over time, and I have picked up a couple of tricks here and there, and I am sure there are more tips out there.\nSpeed in this context is being less sluggish switching between apps, not data-speed.\nPlease add only one solution per answer to make it easier to vote.\n\nA: Cold, hard reboots\nYou perform the reboot by holding down home and power button for about ten seconds, even longer than for the red shutdown slider thingy to appear.\nI have seen it reported in several places, that doing two consecutive reboots like this seems to work better that one. I don't know if that is true, but worth checking out.\n\nA: Turn off Spotlight Search\n\nSettings > General > Spotlight Search > Disable features you do not use\n\nThis seems to have a noticeable effect on how fast you switch between programs\n\nA: Start fresh\nUse iTunes to reinstall iOS from factory settings. To make it even fresher, don't migrate your old data (you'll probably lose games high scores) \nHaving to rethink every settings, pondering whether you really need that GPS localization or this push notification can help limit the number of running processes.\n\nA: Reset settings\nUsing Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings.  \nYou wont' lose any app data, only WiFi password and homescreen icon layout, but I found it to give my iPhone a new life.\n\nA: Manage the number of open apps using the task switcher\nYou can double-tap the Home button to bring up the task switcher, then tap and hold an app's icon to terminate its process. Obvious targets to terminate are open sessions of most games (Angry Birds, Madden, NBA Jam, FIFA Soccer), Safari, etcetera.\nThe key point to remember is that iOS terminates apps in the background for you if it requires more resources such as memory. The rules that iOS uses are not clearly stated by Apple. However, from anecdotal experience and multiple posts online it is commonly believed that the apps that will be terminated first are the ones found at the far right of the task switcher, since those are the ones you have not been using recently.\nWhat that in mind, terminating tasks in the first 1 to 8 icons from the left will most likely make a huge difference, since they will probably still be residing in memory. I see a noticeable difference whenever I terminate any of the first 1 to 8 apps in the task switcher--especially if they are games. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: What are the steps to transfer an iPhone to someone else? I've seen several posts on the general process of handing off an old iPhone to someone else, but there are some details I'm not clear on. I have the following scenario to start with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Person A: iPhone 4\n\n*Person B: iPhone 3G\n\n*Person C: (dumb phone; no data plan)\n\n\nI'd like to end up with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Person A: iPhone 4S\n\n*Person B: iPhone 4 (from A)\n\n*Person C: iPhone 3G (from B; new data plan)\n\n\nCan someone walk me through the steps involved in making this happen? All folks involved have MobileMe accounts and Macs, and the 4S will probably be purchased initially for Person A. Those who start with iPhones have everything fully backed up and encrypted and password protected (so passwords will transfer).\n\nNote: This is specifically a question about what I can do on my own, without going to the carrier's (AT&T) store.\n\nA: There are two separate issues here:\n1. Transferring data plans\nThis is best dealt with directly through your carrier as CajunLuke notes. For person A, a simple SIM swap should work though, for person B you'll need to cut the 3G's SIM down to micro-SIM size to fit in the iPhone 4. And you can probably swap the SIM from the dumbphone into the 3G and have the appropriate data plans added on the account. Still check with your carrier to avoid headaches.\n2. Transferring backups amongst the iPhones\nThis is pretty straightforward. It sounds like the iPhone users have already got them backed up, so you're most of the way there. Do a final backup, and make sure they remember the passwords.\nI'd start with the 4S, since it's a clean phone anyway. When you plug it in to iTunes and activate it, it should ask if you want to set it up as a new iPhone, or restore it from a backup. If it doesn't, just right-click the iPhone in the iTunes source list and choose Restore from Backup. Check to make sure everything seems right on the phone, then you're good to go.\nTo set up the iPhone 4, start by wiping it clean (this is why you want to do the 4S first, in case something goes wrong, you still have the data on the 4). Go to Settings > General > Reset and select Erase all Content and Settings. You'll have to enter the phone's passcode if you use one. Once the wipe is complete, plug it in to Person B's computer and set it up via iTunes as you did with the 4S, but using the backup from Person B's 3G.\nTo set up the 3G, repeat the wipe process above, but set it up as a new phone in iTunes for person C. If the dumbphone has Bluetooth sync capability, you can try transferring contacts to the PC that way using iSync and Address Book (note that Lion no longer includes iSync, you'll need a 10.6 machine or lower). Alternatively, if the phone stores the contacts on the SIM, or has the option to copy them there, you can import SIM contacts on the iPhone by going to Mail, Contacts, Calendars in Settings and selecting Import SIM Contacts.\nApple has a good KB article detailing any additional information you might want located here.\n\nA: I assume that the two existing iPhones and their SIM cards are from AT&T as well. Then you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the existing phones are backuped in iTunes\n\n*Get an iPhone 4S with a new plan (aka SIM card)\n\n*Give the new SIM card to C\n\n*Take out the other two SIM cards, they stay with the person who has them now\n\n*Give the phones to the new owner\n\n*A can register the phone in iTunes and will be prompted to restore from backup\n\n*B can reset the phone in iTunes and will then be prompted to restore as well\n\n*C can reset in iTunes as well\n\n\nA: If they're all on the same carrier, getting all the account holders together with the iPhones and going to the carrier's store would probably be the best solution. The employees there would know best how to handle a transfer like that.\n", "Q: Possible to give Finder back focus after opening and closing file (e.g. in editor)? When you open a file with finder (by pressing cmd-o) and subsequently close the file in whatever application opened it (e.g. TextEdit for a .txt file) by pressing for example cmd-w, the application still has the focus. \nIs it possible to always have the Finder get the focus back (like on Windows)?\n\nA: I don't know of any way to get OS X to behave like Windows in this case, but if the document you open is the only window open in that application, you can quit the app with Cmd+Q instead of just closing the window. If you need to keep the app open after closing the window, you can press Cmd+Tab to quickly return to the Finder once you close the window.\n\nA: In addition to @joelseph's suggestion of completing editing with CommandQ rather than CommandW, if your goal is to preview a file (as opposed to editing it) and the go back to browsing other files, using QuickLook (requires OS X 10.5.0 and later), invoked by pressing the space bar, will allow you to read a file, then return to browsing when you are done reading the file. This doesn't help if you need to edit the file.\n", "Q: Can the Time Capsule back up multiple drives (internal and external) at the same time? I have a 500 GB internal HDD on my MacBook Pro and a second 500 GB external USB drive as well.\nIs it possible to tell Time Machine to back both the internal and external drives up to one Time Capsule?\n\nA: Yes - when you set the Time Machine to back up to the Time Capsule - you will include the internal drive by default.  I would let a couple of backups complete, and then go to the settings for time machine under options and make sure the external drive is not excluded. Kick off a a backup with the external drive connected to make sure it works.\nIf the drive isn't connected when a back up event arrives, the internal will get backed up - but the software will remember and resume backing up the external any time it is connected and a back up happens. You don't need to always have the external drive connected for this to work, you just lose some chances to back it up when it's not connected.\n", "Q: Why do App Store applications transferred into ~/Applications on another machine not launch? I have purchased some apps from the Mac App store and installed them on my personal computer. I would like to install them on a shared work computer. Unfortunately, I do not have admin access to the work computer, so I cannot do this the usual way.\nI have copied the apps from my home computer to the ~/Applications directory of the work computer, and attempted to run them, with mixed success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some apps, when you run them for the first time, open a dialog box that says \"Sign in to use this application on this computer\" and prompt you for your Apple ID and password, after which they work fine. (Example: DayOne, and most free apps)\n\n*Most apps will still show you this dialog box, but for some reason will not work, even after you type in your ID and password. (Example: BBEdit, Soulver, Twitterrific)\n\n\nThe question(s):\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there something I can do to make the app run?\n\n*If not, what is it that is causing the app to refuse to launch?\n\n\nEdit: When the app fails, it  gives a console message \"Exited with exit code: 173\". If I understand correctly, this means that the app is not valid (which is to be expected when I copy it from one computer to another). However, the process by which the App Store validates the app, appears to not work when the app is not in the proper location. Furthermore, it seems likely that apps that do work, such as DayOne or the free apps, work only because they are not checking that the app has been validly purchased and would in fact work on any computer without any kind of validation.\nThe question remains, is there a workaround?\nEdit again: I have no problem copying an app into ~/Applications on my home computer, even for a different user. Because investigating (not to mention solving) this problem requires so much hassle (including two computers or at least a virtual machine), I am offering a bounty.\n\nA: You have hit on an interesting (read: highly annoying) bug in the App Store validation process, it seems:\nFor starters, the location to which you copy your apps does not, in fact, come into it, and neither does your status as admin / non-admin user. Despite the fact Apple states this should be possible, on my two machines, I cannot get an app manually copied to run either as a standard user, an admin user, in /Applications or in ~/Applications. Neither does chowning and chmoding the bundle to conform with regular installs help. The App Store login sheet pop ups (once), but the app keeps quitting with exit code 173 after that.\nAccording to Apple’s developer documentation for the validation of App Store receipts, part of the receipt validating the use of an app is a machine specific GUID. When you copy an app to another machine, the GUID does not match anymore, thus invalidating the receipt (conversely, on your own machine, it always matches, whatever the user you install the app for – hence you not having any problem with that). Apps are meant to signal an invalid receipt by exiting with exit code 173, and the App Store’s storeagent process is meant to take over after that, asking for credentials and generating a new receipt, then re-launching the app on success:\n\nIf the system successfully obtains a valid receipt, it relaunches the application. Otherwise, it displays an error message to the user, explaining the problem.\nDo not display any error message to the user if validation fails. The system is responsible for trying to obtain a valid receipt or informing the user that the receipt is not valid.\n\nWhat happen in your (and my test) case is that validation fails quietly – as indicated by the fact the receipt is never updated, but no error message is shown either. The logs show storeagent returns:\npromptResponse: <CKSignInPromptResponse:0x1080c4fb0 returnCode:1>\n\nThis code is undocumented by Apple, and all I have found are discussions by developers about this issue in a testing context, where it seems to relate to iTunes Connect data being incomplete (Geoff Pado has a concise summary here).\nHowever that may be, the picture as a whole clearly shows validation is failing en route, which leaves apps copied manually with an invalid receipt even after entering the correct credentials to the App Store. Only those apps that do not check their own validity will still run, as you noted.\nNot very helpfully in your case, Apple only recommends deleting and re-downloading from the App Store to remedy the issue.\nTL;DR: You cannot manually copy apps bought in the App Store from one computer to another until Apple fixes the receipt validation process needed for it. Install location and user privilege do not come into it.\n", "Q: Truly Minimize All Windows \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to minimize all windows/applications to the dock? \n\nI am aware of the F11 shortcut, but that doesn't really minimize all windows - it moves them to different corners and then when I open something up they ALL come back.

If you get an error instead (say, you forgot one directory name in the path) you can correct it immediately instead of having to find the mistake at the end.  The only significant limitation is that you have to type an absolute path, starting at either your home directory or the file system root.  There's no concept of a current directory, as in bash.\n\nA: Yes. When the Finder dialog box is active type ⇧⌘G to bring up the Go to the folder direct entry dialog. You can enter the path to the file in the dialog using the Unix-type path expressions you'd expect: ~ for your home directory, / for a directory separator, etc.\n\n\nA: You can also do a \"Utilities > Terminal\"\nThen \"open foo.txt\" or \"open fooApp.app\"\n\"open\" also works with folders in finder.\ni aliased xdg-open to \"open\" on my linux boxes for this reason.\nIf it's a particular file type requiring special app (e.g.: not text) set the association in finder.\n", "Q: Offline HTML5 iPad: Gmail and Docs There was some recent news about the release of an HTML5-powered offline Gmail and Docs.

Now that I figured out how to get Safari to let me navigate tabs the way I want, only one thing remains: I want to be able to reopen my last closed tab with cmd+shift+T. \nNear as I can tell, it's not a matter of making a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences, since Safari does not have a menu item for opening the last closed tab. So how else can I go about this? \n(I've got one slot left available in the free version of FastScripts, so it'd be handy if there were an AppleScript solution for this.)\n\nA: Try clicking ⌘-Z (for undo).\n\nA: As of macOS Sierra beta 1, ⌘ + shift + T works the same way on safari.\nReference: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4v07pt/command_shift_t_now_works_in_safari/\n\nA: or you can download the app SafariTabs\nThere is a feature that saves the tabs and you can restore them for each session.

You can customize the key-bindings to match Chrome-style ⌘+⇧+T too.\n\n\nA: If you are using Keyboard Maestro you could emulate the Chrome behaviour (including multiple undos) with a HotKey trigger.

Has Apple stated any meaning for the 'S' in the iPhone product designations '4S' or '3GS'? Does it mean the same thing in both product names?\n\nA: As of October 2011 when this was first asked, there has been no official answer stated. With the 3GS, Apple officially stated \"the S is for speed.\" There has been no comparable explanation given for the 4S.\nHOWEVER, in an interview at the All Things D conference, Apple CEO Tim Cook\nstated, \"some people might say it stands for Siri or speed.

The mouse cursor in Mac OS X has a lag to it that drives me crazy. I love everything else about the OS though so I'd like to solve this.\nIn an earlier attempt to get rid the lag, I used a couple of programs that changed the acceleration curve of the cursor movement. They sort of worked, but were really just masking the problem a bit. I then tried disabling BeamSync using Quartz Debug. It disabled BeamSync on every EXCEPT the mouse cursor. I know this because when I would drag a window around, the window move move ahead of the cursor. The window edges would tear, indicating they were in fact not waiting for the vertical sync.

I will be interviewing someone in a few weeks for a story, and we won't have the opportunity to meet in person. Therefore, the interview will be done on Skype or something along these lines.\nWhat's the best way to record both me and the person I'll be interviewing?\n\nA: I suggest you use Ecamm Call Recorder. It's a plugin for Skype that will record both sides of the conversation into separate tracks. If you need high quality audio, you could have your interviewee record their own audio locally with QuickTime and send you the audio file. We use a combination of these two to create the Ask Different Podcast - individual QuickTime recordings for quality, and a Skype recording that we use to sync up the conversation.\n\nA: This is a solution involving exclusively  free applications that I found in a great answer here. It involves Soundflower and Audacity. A great video on how - here. It seems that it's superior to the payed solutions, which I found discussed on the net, but which do not provide the same level of customization and complexity (especially, separate tracks and channels).\nI will replicate that solution here with some adjustments according to my system. I have tested this on Mavericks. For more details of the rationale behind this solution, see the links above.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install Soundflower. Restart probably needed.\n\n\n(From the aforementioned source: \nWhy You Need Soundflower\n...you need a separate set of speakers and an additional mic so that Audacity can listen to the output from the speakers through the second mic. We’re assuming you don’t want to buy any additional hardware, and this is where SoundFlower comes in. Using SoundFlower, you will create a separate audio stream i.e. a virtual sound device that you can route the output audio to, and then have Audacity listen to it as if it were input from a second mic.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Audacity. Just copy the entire folder into Applications (or in a different location if you must).\n\n*Open Sound settings and modify like below:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Applications > Utilities > Audio MIDI Setup and from the Window menu, select ‘Show Audio Window’. What you have to do here is to reroute the audio to an output device (a virtual one) that Audacity can listen to and record from. From the plus sign at the bottom, select ‘Create Multi-Output Device’. Once created, select your output source (we were using our built-in speakers) and Soundflower (2ch).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Next, click the plus sign again and select ‘Create Aggregate Device’. Here, select your input device.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Skype’s preferences and select this newly created ‘Multi-Output Device’ as the output device for ‘Speakers’. Your audio output from Skype will be routed to it \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Audacity (relaunch if already running). Go to Preferences and make these changes: change device to 'Aggregate Device' and its channels to 3 or to 4, so that you will have one or (why not) two channels for your mic, and two for the other person’s audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Start recording the Skype conversation. Use a test call first. (Then, use a real call but only for testing purposes. See if after several minutes distortions occur. If so, you may try a different sample rate in the Aggregate Device settings...)\n\n\nYou will get a three-channel audio, that is, your voice and that of the other person will be separate tracks into separate channels. \n\nIt might be a good idea to save your project, thus having the conversation in the original format of Audacity, for future editing, if needed. But in order to save the conversation for use outside Audacity, you have to export it.\n\nBy default, Audacity will try to downmix to mono all the tracks (make one track out of them). You might want to keep them separate: that is a big plus if, for example, you record an interview, which needs to be transcribed and therefore needs to be listened in detail. Your voice and that of the other person can be easily heard/edited/exported separately if they happen to superpose.\nSo, go to Audacity's preferences and change to use custom mix for export\n\nYou will be presented with options regarding the channels settings. You should probably leave them unchanged - see below; (or, if you really need to, you can put different tracks into one channel, or one track in multiple channels, or even increase the number of channels.)\n\nTo see that you got the separate channels in the exported audio file, open it in Audacity. In case the voices are superposed and it's difficult to understand what a person says, you may hear the voices separately, if they are on separate channels, by listening to only one channel at once.  For this, select the 'Solo' option for that channel, and then play. \nThat's why it is better to leave each track in a separate channel - as they are by default if you use custom mix for export. (Then, you can also export only that channel or a part of it etc).\n\n\nIMPORTANT!\nThe changes made to the Sound settings should be reverted when finishing. (The changes made to Skype are not that important, and the program will behave as before.) \nIf Sound output is set to Soundflower (as in the first image), you may be unable to hear anything when playing music in iTunes, for example, if Soundflower is not running, or if 'Built-in' option is not checked like below: \n\nSo, open Soundflower and set it accordingly if you need to use it, or, if you don't need it anymore, close it and change back the Sound output settings to the original: Internal speakers or Headphones - instead of Soundflower.  \n\n\nA: There are multiple ways to do this.\nYou can records video and sound with Screenflow or you can record your audio on your Mac with software like Audacity or Apple's very own QuickTime player by using a jack connecting your audio output with your audio input.\n", "Q: Is there WindowTabs like app on Mac OS X? On Windows, I love to use an app called WindowsTabs. \n\nWindowTabs runs in the background and attaches a tab to each of your application windows. Drag one tab onto another and create a tabbed group. By organizing your windows into logically related groups, you can more easily manage a large number of open windows.\n\nI searched google for Mac equivalent, but got nothing so far.\nDoes anyone know a similar app?\n\nA: StickyWindows creates a tab for every window that sits on the desktop. Its not exactly what WindowsTabs do but it is something ;)\nIt seems to only work with Leopard though :(\n\nA: On the Mac, each app has it's own major window, and it's up to the App developer to allow tabs. Many already do.\nOne app that doesn't is Finder. There is an inexpensive app that adds tab functions to Finder, TotalFinder.\nThis may help a bit.\n\nA: OS X comes with ways to manage many open windows: Exposé, Spaces, and Mission Control. These, along with the fact that most Mac users don't maximize windows, generally obviates the need for third-party window management apps.\nIf you need to group windows from various apps, toss each group into its own Space.\n", "Q: Adding to Mac OS X contextual menu Templates like on Linux Ubuntu Does there exist some method to add the Create document function to the context menu?\nI would love a function like this with the Templates folder because I always need to create files with the same template inside and place it in different folders.\nDoes there exist some app to do this or some Context menu modification for Leopard or Lion?\n\nA: There are a number of ways you could do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could use Automator to create new documents through a Service:\nhttp://pauloppenheim.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/mac-finder-add-new-file-context-menu-item-open-source/\n\n*Use a context menu plugin, but these are less common on 10.6 and 10.7. You may need to run them using Shortcuts:\nhttp://www.abracode.com/free/cmworkshop/macosx_10_6_snow_leopard_and_contextual_menu_plugins.html\n\n*Best of all, in my opinion, you can use a little known OS X feature called Stationary Pad. It's on the Get Info dialog of any file. The way you would go about using it is to create your template file, mark it as a Stationary Pad and then every time you double click it a new copy of that template will be created. Read more:\nhttp://ignorethecode.net/blog/2009/05/31/creating-new-documents/\n\n\nA: Not sure if I understand your question correctly. If you want to create new files from some template(s), there's no need for a context menu entry. Just mark the template file as \"Stationery pad\" by opening the file's Info window in Finder (⌘i or menu File > Get Info) and selecting \"Stationery pad\" in the \"General\" section.\nThen, double-clicking that template file will always make a copy of it and open the copy using the default application. You just save the copy under a different name wherever you need it, and your template stays where it was.\n\nA: Neu\nThis applications adds \"Create Document...\" and \"Create And Open\nDocument...\" menus to various places, including the main menubar, the\nDock, and the Services menu that the Finder shows when you right-click\non something. You can also trigger Neu from any application using a\nspecial key combination.\nNeu lets you choose what to make from a list of templates, which are simply existing files. Once you've chosen a template, Neu creates a copy of it, brings the Finder to the front, and selects the new file.\n", "Q: Migrate local user account to network account If I have a user with a local profile on their mac and they want to migrate all the data to a network based account (OS X Lion server), what's the best way to do this?\n\nA: Why wouldn't you use the Migration Assistant to move users?\nIt's wicked fast over gigabit ethernet, knows what preference files are needed and can handle special cases better than rsync or other simple file copy methods.\nOnce the user is there, you can delete it (preserving the home folder) and then re-create the user with the proper server UID / home folder location or just edit these in the directory service where user data is stored.\nIt really depends more on how you want your server set up than just getting the files. Some setups it's easier to move first and fix later - others you should just set up the new account and let users move their files by hand once they have logged into their new accounts.\nI would probably set up the server account for the user and once you have created the Home records in Workgroup Manager you can copy the files from a backup or the old client machine (paying attention to ownership by moving the contents of the home folder directories and resetting permissions to match the server UID/GID) before binding the client machine to the server accounts.\n", "Q: How does Google Voice access the microphone on the iOS through the browser? Apple hasn't approved the Google Voice app so Google created it as a web page.\nMy understanding is that the web browser doesn't (currently) have access to the hardware (such as the Microphone).\nSo, how does Google access the Mic through the browser?\n\nA: It doesn't access the phone hardware directly. Instead, you enter the number and Google's servers call the number entered and simultaneously calls your iPhone on it's number. \nMerging those two calls happens in google's servers, putting both you and your recipient in communication through their hardware.\n", "Q: What's the license for OS X generic icons? Can anyone link me to a document or otherwise provide information about what the license is for the generic icons included in OS X (Lion)? I tried searching at developer.apple.com but nothing relevant came up.\nTo be specific, I'm wondering about GenericFolderIcon.icns. If I copy it and customize the look, would distribution be restricted somehow?\n\nA: IANAL but I would guess that all the graphical assets in OS X are copyright Apple just like everything else in the OS. \nAny assets that you are entitled to use are listed on the developer sites for which typically a licence must be signed.\n", "Q: hd video player for mac I just saw that VLC doesn't support 10-bit yet (i checked the link here and i don't see a 1.2 build) http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=94686\nIs there any other good player that supports this?\n\nA: The comments in the link you provide indicate the latest vlc-git nightly release should work with 10-bit mkv files.\nOn the VLC nightly build page, look for the first file with a file name that starts with \"vlc-git-intel\" or \"vlc-git-intel64\". Download the former if you want the 32-bit version, the latter for 64-bit. (Even though the vlc-git files don't indicate their version number in the file name, the latest nightly build, as of 10/6/11, is a version 1.2 build)\nBe aware these are considered unstable versions, so you may come across unexpected bugs while using the software.\nYou could also try MplayerX, which I think should support 10-bit video.\n", "Q: Can you hide hidden files in specific folders (like the desktop) while keeping them shown everywhere else? I work with hidden files all the time, but I like an uncluttered desktop. It would be nice to make files like .DS_Store, and .localized invisible just on the Desktop.\nPlease note I am already aware of this trusty old terminal standby:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\nkillall Finder\n\nSetting that flag to FALSE applies to everything in the system. My goal is to make an exception for the Desktop. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Although i'm unsure how to fulfill your exact request, I use this tiny widget which gives 1 button access to hide/show hidden files.\n\nA: chflags hidden ~/Desktop/hideme\n\nThis makes the file/folder invisible from the Finder and save/open panels.\nYou can use {command}{shift}. to toggle visibility during save/open.\n\nA: My approach to this was to set Finder to generally show invisible files, and then explicitly set the invisible flag on files/folders on the Desktop which match certain criteria (.*, Icon, etc).\nBut this approach failed, as Finder then consequently not only shows files hidden because they start with a dot, but also those which have the invisible flag in their filesystem entry.\nNevertheless I post this idea to you, maybe it leads you to a solution.\n# Set Finder to show all hidden files\n# Only needs to be executed one time.\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles ON\n\n# Then explicitly flag certain files on the Desktop as invisible\n# Run this at every login or at certain intervals (cron job)\n/usr/bin/SetFile -a V ~/Desktop/.* ~/Desktop/Icon ~/Desktop/OtherPatternForHiding\n\n\nA: This does not answer your very specific question but provides an alternative solution.\nAssuming you want to have easy and quick access to the hidden files and not have them open all the time, which is not recommended anyway.\nHere is a little script that Automates the process down to a single click to Show or Hide. \nIt eliminates:\n1-possible problems with hidden files showing all the time\n2-opening terminal and typing the show hidden files, command each time.\n3-Extremly users friendly.\nInstall this as application onto your dock for easy and fast access.\n-- AppleScript to toggle hidden \".\" files\n-- Submitted by Baltwo on Apple Support Community\n\ntry\n    do shell script \"defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles\"\non error\n    do shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 0\"\nend try\n\nif (do shell script \"defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles\") is equal to \"0\" then\n    do shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1\"\nelse\n    do shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 0\"\nend if\n\ndo shell script \"killall Finder\"\n\n\nA: I would suggest trying out TotalFinder. Among many other features, it gives you a shortcut to show/hide invisible files in the Finder, but it does not show invisible files on the Desktop.\nIt's $18, but you also get tabbed and dual-pane Finder windows, and a Visor-like Finder window that you can pop up from any app.\n\nA: This is admittedly a kludge, but replacing the icons for .localized and .DS_Store with a transparent .icns file like this one allows you to drag them into a screen location that's marginally less obnoxious, from a clutter perspective. It's still not as good as being able to assert the equivalent of ShowAllFilesExceptHere\n", "Q: How to delete bad entries in Mail's helpful drop-down lists? When I send an email, I type two or three letters and select the recipient's full name in the list that pops up.  A great feature.  But one day I mistyped an email address and now have several junk entries in that list.  How do I delete those?\n\nA: Go ahead and complete that \"bad\" name, then click on the downward arrow to the right of the address.\n\nYou can also use the Previous Recipients window to clean things systematically rather than on demand when you are composing and seeing the ones you wish to prune. Once that is complete, check your contacts to make sure the bad address is not stored as a legitimate contact.\n", "Q: Wifi drops when screen is locked I have a Mid 2010 MBP, running 10.7.1.\nEver since I upgraded to Lion, I have noticed that Wi-Fi connections that require 802.1x authentication are dropping whenever I lock the screen. The connections remain down until I unlock, at which point they quickly start passing traffic again.\nThis behavior is new as of 10.7.\nAs I mentioned earlier, this only applies to 802.1x connections. Unencrypted Wifi and non-802.1x connections are not affected. My guess is that the keychain is de-authenticating my 802.1x session when I lock the machine and then re-authenticating when I unlock.\nDo you know of any way to prevent this behavior?\n\nEdit:\nI'm using username/password auth for 802.1x, not certificate auth.\n\nA: I had this exact problem, and I was pretty annoyed by it. I stopped \"locking\" my screen, and instead started \"sleeping\" display. The wifi stays connected when screen is asleep. I assigned \"Sleep Display\" to a hotkey using BetterTouchTool (http://blog.boastr.net/). \nThen, I went to System Preferences > Security > Require Password after sleep or screensaver begins. \nNow my hotkey puts my display to sleep, and then the computer requires password when I wake it up. So it's the same functionality of Locking my computer without losing wifi. \n\nA: If you're using a .cer certificate to authenticate, can you add it to the system keychain and set it to always trust?\n\nA: In MacOS, I see 2 model \"lock\"\n_Login Windows: this model actived, may be drop connection\n_Just Lock: lock screen and not dtop connection\nTo access lock method you want, you can install \"Lock Me Now\" on AppStore, it's free.\n\nA: If you open up Keychain Access, go to Preferences..., and then click on the First Aid tab, is everything checked?  There is an option to keep the Keychain unlocked there.  Perhaps that's the option you need?\n", "Q: Map app for iPad that works while you're not connected to WiFi or 3G? About to drive across country and, while we're sporting iPhones, it sure would be nice if the navigator could use our iPad, non-3G, version to view maps while we're traveling. I've looked through the app store but the field is littered with impostors and the carnage of the poorly implemented.\nDoes such a thing exist? Is there a well-made, offline map app for the iPad?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd need it to cover Canada (Eastern and Atlantic) and the North East United States (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, upper state New York).\n\n*Obviously I don't expect it to do any positioning (does the iPad 2 even have a GPS radio?) so an app that just called up street level maps would be fine. We're old enough to understand how to find our place in the world without a GPS lock on. :)\n\n\nA: These apps might be of interest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Galileo Offline Maps\n\n*OffMaps 2\n\n*Comparison of iOS Map apps\nAccording to OffMaps2 library search, maps of New York, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and parts of Canada are available. \nHope that helps, and enjoy your trip!\n\nA: Try Galileo. I tested it earlier and it works very good!\n", "Q: Can I configure my apple remote with custom keys/functions?

I am looking for a way to have some text \"permanently\" copied to the clipboard and assigned to a hotkey?\nAny software suggestions?\n\nA: If I understand your request correctly, TextExpander might be right up your alley. It allows you to assign custom abbreviations to text snippets and graphics for insertion anywhere.\n", "Q: How to wake my Mac remotely so I can use screen sharing? I have two computers: a Mac Pro, and a Macbook Air. When my Mac Pro is on (awake), I can use screen sharing to take over its screen. It displays in the Finder sidebar as a networked computer. However, when it is asleep, it does not appear in the sidebar.\nHow can I wake my Mac Pro (or always have it displayed in the sidebar) so when I am ready to screen share, it is available? \nI have already enabled Wake for ethernet network access in System Preferences > Energy Saver. Now I need to figure out how to wake it up.\nUpdate: I am running Snow Leopard on all of them. I am also networked using an Airport Extreme.\nUpdate: From what I understand, you can only use WakeOnLan on computers hard-wired to the network. My laptop is using Wi-Fi and my desktop is hard-wired. I'm trying to wake my desktop from my wi-fi laptop, but WakeOnLan does not allow sending the \"WakeOnLan packets\" from a non-hard-wired connection. Can someone confirm/deny this statement?\n\nA: The aptly called WakeOnLan is a free, simple tool for Mac, both available as application and widget.\n\nWhat is WakeOnLan?\n  WakeOnLan discovers all other computers in your\n  LAN, and enables you to wake them up by clicking a button. If your\n  remote computer is a Mac you can put it asleep too.\n\n\n\nA: You can wake up your Mac over wireless.\nFirst, your Mac must support Wake on Wireless. \nSecond, your router must support Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WME), also known as Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM).\nAfter your enabled WME on your router, you must enable \"Wake for network access\" on your Mac. \nThen check the MAC address of your wireless card of your Mac. \nPut your Mac into sleep. \nFrom a second computer log in to your router and with the WOL (Wake on LAN) option wake up your Mac wirelessly by entering the MAC address.\n....\nWake on Demand requires an Apple AirPort Base Station or Time Capsule with firmware 7.4.2 or later installed. To use Wake on Demand wirelessly with a WPA or WPA2 network, the AirPort base station or Time Capsule must be hosting the network (see below).\n\nA: Sleeping Macs with wake for ethernet access enabled will register with an Airport so that an incoming ssh connection will be sensed by the router and send a Wake on Lan packet to wake up the Mac.\nBasically, ssh can wake a sleeping mac under some circumstances. This function also works for screen sharing.\n\nA: Apple Remote Desktop can wake a remote computer up. See the following article: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=RemoteDesktop/3.0/en/ARDC864.html\n\nA: I have been looking for years, and nothing can wake a sleeping Mac if it's on a Wifi network. Except the Mac itself with the right software. But nothing external can do it. In fact, I feel more secure because of that fact.\n", "Q: How to change speed of podcast playback on iPad running iOS 5's Music app? It seems the option to enable double, normal, or half speed playback is gone from the Music app on iPads running iOS 5.\nAnyone ran into this? Workarounds?\n\nA: It seems the speed controls are available in iOS 5.1. They just are not there in 5.0.\n\nA: I wish I knew the answer. Mine has defaulted to half speed. :(\nI do have a workaround you might be interested in though. After muh searching, I found an app called SpeedUp Player, which lets you set a playback speed between 0.5x and 2.5x. It's not perfect, but it does the job as a temporary fix.\n\nA: I have not had this issue myself, but several of my listeners have mentioned it. Has anyone tried removing the podcasts in question from syncing in iTunes and then reenabling it so the files are removed from and then copied back on to the device?\n\nA: For the audiobook and/or podcast in question, open up it's information box and click the \"Options\" button. In this section make sure the \"Media Kind\" is set to eiter \"Audiobook\" or \"Podcast\". iTunes relies solely on this paramater to know what playback features will be available for the media file in question. Playback speed options are only enabled for items marked as either of these two categories. \nUpdated: Here's a screen capture of my iPad running iOS 5.1\n\n", "Q: Prevent mobile Safari from loading the last page when started Whenever I open Safari on both my iPhone and iPad, it starts loading the last webpage that I visited in the past, which is not very convenient. \nIs there a way to stop it from doing this?\n\nA: You could save a bookmark to about:blank (or your desired home page) as an icon in your home screen. Then click that to launch Safari rather than the Safari icon.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Safari.\n\n*Type the url about:blank into the URL area and go to that page. The page will, unsurprisingly, be empty.\n\n*Press the share button, and select \"Add to Home Screen\"\n\n*Assign a name to this blank page. In your case, you might want to call it Safari.\n\n\n(Dan Frakes of MacWorld spells out these steps at http://www.macworld.com/article/159303/2011/04/ios_safari_blank_page.html; thanks to Heng-Cheong Leong for point this out).\nAlternately, you could close any pages you had open in Safari before exiting the program.\n", "Q: how to delete characters placed next to cursor on MacBook Pro I have recently shifted from PC to Mac and from what I recall on PC keyboards, there are keys where you can delete characters placed before your cursor as well as after cursor. I don't recall what the later is called.\nI can't find something equivalent for Mac to delete post cursor characters.\n\nA: For forward delete, hold down fn (the function key) and press delete.\n\nA: Laptop keyboards and Apple Wireless Keyboards use fn+delete ⌫ for forward delete. Keyboards with a numeric keypad have a separate delete ⌦ key like on other platforms.\n", "Q: What are the advantages of buying a Mac at an Apple Store? I'm trying to determine if it's better to purchase a Mac from an Apple Store or from a separate retailer. Beyond the hands on and focused purchase experience are there long term advantages derived from an Apple store purchase (ongoing support etc.) as opposed to purchasing from an independent retailer?\n\nA: *\n\n*Apple One to One is only available at the time of purchase and only from Apple online or retail.\n\n*Apple retail store return policy is excellent.  I did not know which of three USB hubs would satisfy the taste of an interior-decorator client, so I bought them all, let her decide, and returned the rejects.  I did not know which portable wireless speakers would perform better, so I bought two and returned one after in-home trial.  I did not know whether my home network would see any improvement from the 5th generation Airport Extreme, so I bought three, experimented, and returned one (performance improved about eightfold).\n\n\nA: There isn't a meaningful difference between buying at an Apple Store or another retailer beyond your experience in-store. Personally, I prefer Apple stores to most of the other computer retailers just in terms of shopping experience, but a new Mac is a new Mac.\n\nA: You get a lovely drawstring handled bag with the Apple logo for one.\nAlso, if you have an Apple ID they will email a copy of your receipt to the associated email address.\n\nA: Aside from the service and other qualitative aspects of dealing directly with Apple, the only \"advantage\" of purchasing direct from the company is the up to date warranty registration. If you purchase your Apple product through a 3rd party, Apple will have on file an \"estimated\" purchase date based on the model's manufacturing date.\nIf you want to claim all of the 365 days on your warranty, you will have to send them the receipt (a scan or picture suffices) in addition to other purchase information so they can update their database to reflect the exact date of purchase.\nOther than that, it makes little difference at the end of the day.\n\nA: You cannot take the year of Apple classes for $99 if you don't purchase there. I called because I wanted them to price match a deal from Best Buy for MacBook Air . They discounted but would not match( almost $80 difference).I asked about the classes and they said you can only buy them if you get it at their store. So I would be paying $80 more and tax on that, plus the $99 for classes. Sad because I was really looking forward to them.\n\nA: If you buy something from the Apple Store, for example a Macbook, and a newer model comes out within two weeks, they will swap it no questions asked for a new one. You have to have all original packaging.

This is apparent if you run Linux/Windows natively on your Mac.\nHowever, macOS applications are responsible for handling these functions as they see fit, which is different from what you'd see on Windows or Linux. Therefore, the macOS Terminal application needs some tweaking to use these keys.\nI believe the reason for this is that macOS follows an old-school Unix tradition where:\nctrl + a = Home\nctrl + e = End\nI now use this routinely, but my terminal-reflexes still demand a proper home,end,pg-up,pg-down...\nEdit macOS's Terminal Keyboard Binding Settings to match\n\n\n\n\nI tend to get this entered by copying a similar entry that already exists,  then using the 'delete a character' button, I remove the different bits before typing in the rest.\nOverall, this will look along these lines:\n\nThis meets all my expectations for how this should work. It works in vim and through ssh.\n\nA: On my (Danish) keyboard layout (under 10.7.5) it is fn + shift + ↑/↓.\n\nA: If you have a full keyboard you can use the pgup and pgdown keys on your keyboard, near the numpad. \nIf you are not using a full keyboard, function, labeled fn on your keyboard, plus the up and down arrow keys will give you a page up and down.\nFor certain applications, particularly in shell / terminal / tty windows, the expected behaviour is achieved with fn+shift+arrow up/down\n\nA: PageUp:\nFn+UP\nPageDown:\nFn+DOWN\nSuccessfully tested on my brand new MBPro retina !\n\nA: Mac OS Catalina:\n\nScroll to the page-top - cmd+ ↑\nScroll to the page-bottom - cmd+ ↓\n\nPageUp - fn + ↑\nPageDown - fn + ↓\n\nA: user Fn\nPageUp: Fn+UP\nPageDown: Fn+DOWN\n\nA: Alt + up/down arrows: pgup/pgdown\nSpacebar and shift + spacebar: : pgup/pgdown\nCommand + up/down arrows: home/end\n", "Q: How to map the F11 and F12 keys to Volume Up/Volume Down I have chosen to use the F1-F12 keys with their original -PC- behavior, because I want F5 to refresh the page in Firefox!

This project seems nice, but I don't want to use it.\n\nA: You aren't alone in wanting the color back.  Unfortunately, it looks as if the Finder code actually shifts the hue from the fully-colored icon resources that are included (see the Go menu in Finder, which has the colored versions).  \nAccording to a commenter on this MacThemes Forum thread, the developer documentation actually details how to shift the hue in the same way that Finder does; with the associated speculation that we'll see grey icons in every app that has a sidebar in the future.\nLooks to me as if you can bite the bullet and use ColorfulSidebar (with SIMBL) or live with the grey.\n", "Q: Connect to wireless network without password A new Mac user here...\nOn Windows, I could connect to my parents' router by clicking a WPS button on the router and then connecting to the network within a given timeframe, even though I can't remember the password.\nIs this possible on Macs?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible on Macs as well as Windows.\nThe router is doing the control of who can get in without a passcode. Just perform the same action on the router to get it to suspend the password for the next client and let the mac be the next to join the WiFi network.\nUse AirPort Utility to Add Wireless Clients... from the Base Station menu for your router...\n\n\nA: This is most likely because you stored the password on your parent's PC.

I did a Time Machine backup under Lion, and wish to go back to snow leopard.\nWhat can I import from my time machine backup that will not crash snow leopard ? I think all the \"i\" apps (iCal, iTunes, etc) won't work, but what about system preferences and such ? Will that work or will it crash my system ?\n\nA: This isn't something that Apple tests well (or perhaps at all) - so you might have some crashes, but in general these are minor or confined to one app.\nIf you do the downgrade, just be systematic about watching for crashes, keep all the backups. You can always trash the preferences if you have odd feelings or just trash them all after the restore to start \"clean\" with Snow Leopard defaults but all of your Lion data.\nIt would be much better to export the data from Lion and restore from your last Snow Leopard backup, but your time may be spent there for no need or you could be \"committing\" your time later to debugging things.\nIt really depends on how much changes you made and the details of what changed file by file, preference by preference.

I am running OSX Lion.\nI've looked all over the web for solutions to the issue I'm having and can't find a fix.  I've found several entries where uses are trying to resolve custom_hostname.dev (etc, etc), but I'm actually trying to use the search domains for FQDN.  I do not have access to the DNS systems, so my system is assigned some DNS server IPs, but I  have to manually set all the search domains for some of the hosts.  For example:\nsearch loc1.sitea.example.net, loc2.sitea.example.net, loc1siteb.example.net\n\nLet's say  host mytesthost is in loc2.sitea.example.net.  I would have expected that when I type in mytesthost, that it would search the search domains and resolve an IP, however, in order for this to work, I actually have to type in mytesthost.loc2.sitea.example.net.\nThe \"error\" I get is \"unknown host\", which tells me that it is not resolving the hostname.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: The domains in the search directive should be separated by whitespace only, not commas.  So replace\nsearch loc1.sitea.example.net, loc2.sitea.example.net, loc1siteb.example.net\n\nwith\nsearch loc1.sitea.example.net loc2.sitea.example.net loc1siteb.example.net\n\nand try it again.

I've tried to remove it, but no luck so far.  I'm thinking the problem may be with the .plist file, as it is expecting a java-based program as opposed to any other executable\n\nA: This won't work for a signed app, but here's how I was able to get this to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a copy of the app you're trying to modify in case something goes wrong.

Let's assume I have an SSD that supports TRIM-supported drive, and I create a single encrypted partition that fills the entire disk (minus the obligatory GUID and recovery partitions). Is FileVault 2 smart enough to TRIM deleted bits, or does the full disk encryption prevent this from happening? Even if it does TRIM deleted bits, will the encryption of the full partition (presumably marking every bit in that partition as used) slow down the drive because there's nowhere clean left for it to write to, resulting in write amplification?\n\nA: I guess I wasn't that convinced, so I tested this empirically. \nSetup: MacBookPro6,2, Mac OS X 10.8.2, FileVault2 enabled, Crucial C300 256GB (firmware 0007)\n\nWith TRIM disabled, I nearly filled the disk (5 GB left) over the course of everyday usage. Deleting ~50 GB of files, I then tried to create a 50 GB disk image. Results were pretty pathetic - an initial peak at 180 MBps quickly dropping down to average writes of about 15 MBps, the disk clearly stuttering (showing periods of zero writes where presumably the disk was trying to catch up). The file was deleted, and afterwards I enabled TRIM. Again, I tried to create the disk image, and again I got the same results. Finally, after deleting the disk image, I created a disk image for the third time - with freshly TRIM'd bits. Average performance was 200 MBps and was sustained.\nSo no, FileVault2 does not interfere with TRIM. (And no, garbage collection is not sufficient, Crucial.)\n\nA: TRIM support is not dependent on the encryption system you use. If your system supports TRIM and TRIM is activated then no matter how you store your data the low level IO operations will be handled by the system and will be not even know the difference between encrypted and unencrypted data.\nSo FileVault changes nothing at that level.\n\nA: Core Storage (aka using FileVault 2) operates above the level of TRIM storage handling so you won't negate the benefits of TRIM by enabling encryption.\nTRIM speeds up reuse of deleted blocks on the storage. When the OS marks a block free, the SSD doesn't care if that block contained zeroes, ones or encrypted data. FileVault 2 doesn't change how many blocks get freed - just the pattern of what was left behind. \nBefore TRIM, the cleanup process suffers from write amplification - after trim commands are sent, that effect is minimized. \n\nA: I use FileVault 2 with TRIM enabled. It works without problems, but be aware that trimming out blocks make them zeroed out when read. This makes an attacker able to check how many blocks are written on the drive. This could lead to improved attacks.\n", "Q: How to sync Gmail contacts keeping exchange contacts? I have an iPhone with an exchange account and also a gmail account. I saw Google's instructions to sync Gmail contacts and it says to first tell contacts to stop syncing on the exchange account. The article gives this screen shot:\n\nHowever when I tell my Exchange contacts to stop syncing I don't have the top option (Keep on my iPhone) - it just has the option to delete or cancel. I want to keep my exchange contacts in my phone book but I also want to make my Gmail account the one that syncs the contacts.\n\nA: Use iTunes to sync and make sure you have your phone contacts in your MS-Exchange folder. Then you can either use the Google Apps migration tool or export them from outlook and into gmail.\nNext you can remove the exchange account (which will probably delete you contacts).\nNext you can uncheck the box in itunes that says \"sync my contacts\" so that they will all come off of your phone. Make sure you have them backed up first.\nYou can also uncheck the box to tell it not to sync the calendar if you like.\nNext, you can add a Gmail account or google apps account - but when you do, don't click on Gmail for the account type - choose \"Exchange\" because it allows syncing of contacts and calendars, too.\n\nSee the gmail site for more details:\nhttp://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740\n\nA: Here is another idea. Check out the online service http://yoxel.com, it can sync your Gmail and Exchange contacts periodically in the background. This way you can simply configure your iPhone to sync with just one service (Gmail or Exchange).\n\nA: Don't remove the Exchange account manually, add the Google account first and you will then get that option. \nDoes that work? It seems to do it for me. \n", "Q: Are there any physical differences between regional versions of the iPhone 4s? I'm in the market for an iPhone 4S to replace my older iPhone and iPod. If I took a Christmas holiday in America, the cost of a US phone is substantially less than a UK phone at current exchange rates.  \nHowever, there's a possibility that there's physical differences between the UK model and the US version that would make the US version impractical in the UK.  I know that the range of bands used for cellular comms in the UK differs somewhat from in the US.  \nSo, is the iPhone 4S built to only a single design that can handle the differing frequencies used throughout Apple's main markets, meaning that a SIM-free one will work anywhere regardless of where it was bought?  Or is each model tailored to a particular region's cellular specifications, making a US bought iPhone all but useless in the UK?\n\nA: The iPhone 4S is the same in every country. The only notable change is the default language configured on the device. And firmware/software locks for carrier or country locked phones.\nThe important difference is that apparently the unlocked iPhone 4S in the US will not be supposed to work on CDMA networks (rumor) for undisclosed reasons. It is probably due to the primitive way CDMA phones are activated by CDMA carriers.\nObviously the packaging changes (depending on the region). Also the power brick is different depending on the country for example in Europe except British territories the power plug uses Type C plugs while UK uses Type B and the US have Type A plugs.\nAll the iPhone 4S will \"supposedly\" have she same internals and the same firmwares. There are no other differences while the iPhone 4 has different firmwares for CDMA and GSM as there have been no variants for the iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS models which were the same across the globe.\nBUT beware of the term unlocked. It doesn't mean the phone is not SIM-locked. In some countries (I have in mind the case of the iPhone 3G in Canada) unlocked can mean not locked for the country carriers. Which means it is regionally SIM-locked, if you try to use it with any of the countries' carriers it will work, but if you try to use it with a SIM from another country or an international SIM, it will be locked.\n\nA: The only difference is it is .1 oz heavier than the iPhone 4, everything is still the same. And I believe that is across the world.\nhttp://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html  <-- iPhone 4s\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/SP587 <--- iPhone 4\n", "Q: Audio device on iOS 4?

Is there an app that will let me automatically resize all my open windows when I switch between working on my laptop screen and my external monitor?\nI spend my time either working on an external monitor connected to my mbp or just my mbp.  When I switch from monitor to laptop, all my fullscreen (the old definition) apps have windows that are bigger than my laptop resolution.  I have to resize all of them, but then when I reconnect to the external monitor they are all smaller then I would like them.\nI've tried moon, but have only been able to resize windows on a single space at a time, I typically have multiple applications in fullscreen mode (the old definition) open across multiple spaces.\n\nA: There are endless ways to do this, so here are a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before you unplug the external monitor open up the Displays\nPreference Pane in System Preferences and click on the \"Gather\nWindows\" button.\n[or if you already unplugged]\n\n*Hold the Option key down and choose \"Arrange in Front\" from the\nWindow menu.\n[or]\n\n*Use the Option key and click the (+) at the top of any\nFinder window and it will resize them all automatically.\n\nThis Applescript script might also work:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n-- get desktop dimensions (dw = desktop width; dh = desktop height)\nset db to bounds of window of desktop\nset {dw, dh} to {item 3 of db, item 4 of db}\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\nrepeat with proc in application processes\ntell proc\nrepeat with win in windows\n-- get window dimensions (w = width; h = height)\nset {w, h} to size of win\n\n-- get window postion (l = left of window; t = top of window)\nset {l, t} to position of win\n\n-- nh = new window height; nw = new window width\nset {nh, nw} to {h, w}\n\n-- window width is bigger than desktop size,\n-- so set new window width to match the desktop\nif (w > dw) then ¬\nset nw to dw\n\n-- window height is bigger than the desktop size (minus menu bar),\n-- so set new window height to be desktop height - 22 pixels\nif (h > dh - 22) then ¬\nset nh to dh - 22\n\n-- r = right coordinate of window; b = bottom coordinate of window\nset {r, b} to {l + nw, t + nh}\n\n-- nl = new left coordinate; nt = new top coordinate\nset {nl, nt} to {l, t}\n\n-- left coordinate is off screen, so set new left coordinate\n-- to be 0 (at the left edge of the desktop)\nif (l < 0) then ¬\nset nl to 0\n\n-- top coordinate is above bottom of menu bar (22 pixels tall),\n-- so set new top coordinate to be 22\nif (t < 22) then ¬\nset nt to 22\n\n-- right coordinate extends beyond desktop width,\n-- so set new left coordinate to be desktop width - window width\nif (r > dw) then ¬\nset nl to dw - nw\n\n-- bottom coordinate extends beyond desktop height,\n-- so set new top coordinate to be desktop height - window height\nif (b > dh) then ¬\nset nt to dh - nh\n\n-- if we have calculated a new top or left coordinate, reposition window\nif (l ≠ nl or t ≠ nt) then ¬\nset position of win to {nl, nt}\n\n-- if we have calculated a new height or width, resize window\nif (h ≠ nh or w ≠ nw) then ¬\nset size of win to {nw, nh}\nend repeat\nend tell\nend repeat\nend tell\n\n\nOf course there's also the paid alternative, which might include Stay, Divy, Arrange, etc.\n\nA: You might give Stay a try. It lets you set window sizes/arrangements based on attached displays, and has Spaces support. I'm not sure if it has the exact behaviour you're looking for with Spaces (the FAQ is unclear), but it's probably worth checking the demo out at least.\n\nA: I tinkered around with keyboard shortcuts for window behaviors. Mission control is the main reason I switched my daily driver to Mac from PC, but it takes a little customization to make it better. Here are some I made:\nFor all applications:\nMove Window to Left Side of Screen: control-option-command-,\nMove Window to Right Side of Screen: control-option-command-.\nZoom: control-option-command-/\nSome apps function differently. For example, the Photos app would require a different command for \"Zooming the window\" because the \"Zoom on photo\" command confuses it. So I simply made it:\nFor Photos app:\nZoom: Z (function-Z)\nZoom All: control-option-command-/\nTo be honest, I haven't used an external display yet, but I hope this helps you! This works for me because I like to have an app \"snap left\" or \"snap right\" like in windows without going into full screen mode, since I like having the menu bar visible always. And using \"zoom\" makes it \"full screen\" without actually entering full screen mode.\n(To add keyboard shortcuts, go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts then click on the plus sign to add one.)\n", "Q: Is there an app that creates a system-wide audio equalizer? I like using iTunes' equalizer, but that only works in iTunes.\nI'm looking for some software that lets me apply a global, system-wide equalizer to Mac OS X.\nThe app (or pref pane, etc.) would let me change EQ settings and have that apply to all apps (iTunes, Spotify, Chrome, etc.).\nIdeally the software would have some nice presets like iTunes does.\nFree preferred, but I'm certainly willing to consider buying something.\n\nA: There's a free method using Soundflower and an Apple Developer Application called AU Lab (you'll need a free Apple Developer account get it, search for \"AU Lab\" after login). \nBasically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install both programs\n\n*Change your audio output to Soundflower in System Preferences\n\n*Open AU Lab and pipe the Soundflower signal to your audio out.\n\n*Apply an AUGraphicEQ filter in AU Lab\n\n*Fiddle with levels to your heart's content.\n\n\nThis solution was taken from a blog post at Dctr Watson. That page also contains better instructions and a startlingly informative comment thread.\n\nA: \nI didn't want to pay to have an equalizer so I developed my own one and giving it away for free! Click  here to download eqMac!\nThe app is signed by Apple and works for OSX 10.9 and higher!\n\nA: There is also Hear. It has an equalizer as well as bass boosting.  \n\nHear greatly improves audio quality in movies and music throughout all of your Mac OS X applications. With Hear, music is richer, movie sound and dialog is clearer and games will blow you out of your chair!  \n\nTry the 30 day demo for Free:  https://www.prosofteng.com/hear/heardemo/\n\n\n\nA: Check out Boom, it's quite awesome.\n\nBoom boosts the volume of your Mac at all levels.

You can now boost the volume of any application\n  playing sound or video like QuickTime, Podcasts, Skype, iChat, DVD\n  Player, Garageband, iMovie and so on.\n\n\n\nA: I use AirFoil, lets me take advantage of AirPlay, and the EQ works for all sound output.\n\nA: Audio Hijack application which is developed by the same company for AirFoil. This is a host application which accept various audio plugins (wide range of prices and audio effects).\nThis is the setup I have tested with good reliability and effectiveness compared to other applications mentioned above this post (I have tried almost all of them before settled with this one).\nNote all these applications have to be system extensions of Mac OS X in order to provide system-wide effects. Thus they are very much dependent on versions of Mac OS X. Mac OS X upgrades bond to break some of them.\nUltimately the best audio enhancement is to have an external DAC through USB port on Mac and a matching quality speaker without any of these audio enhancing applications.\n\nA: Soundflower combined with Element is a good solution. It lets you use the AU and VST Plugins that are integrated already in the macOS.\nWorks great on 10.13\n", "Q: Why isn't search working in Finder?

I just put orders in for a few new iPhone 4S upgrades for the wife and I but I'm not sure how to keep her data (app data mainly, the other essentials are synced with outlook).\nShe has an iPhone 3G, so can't upgrade to iOS 5 then backup where my 3GS phone can.  Can an iTunes backup of her 4.2.1 (latest she can get) iOS be restored to a newer iOS 5 phone, or will it only work on an equivalent 4.2.1 iOS-running device?  Or...is there another series of steps to make that possible?\nIf not, is there a completely different way to get her app data off the phone and onto her new one?\nAside: I realize I can test this as soon as the phones actually arrive...but we're sending the current ones off for resale as soon as possible after getting the long-awaited upgrades.  For that, I'm trying to get anything I may need to order for the transfer, etc. taken care of ahead of time.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible.  The backups themselves contain application data and other information that isn't particularly version-specific (with the exception of going from 4.3 backwards, as pointed out by hobs above).\nIn fact, I had to do this exact process recently, going from 4.2.1 to an iOS 5.0 gold master on an iPhone using a backup, and it went off without a hitch.  Developers who want to install a prerelease OS version must put their devices in recovery mode, clean install the OS, then restore application data and settings from a backup.  I did this for my iPhone, which I hadn't upgraded to the latest 4.x OS, and everything came across cleanly to iOS 5.0.\nThe one thing to watch out for is that if you don't encrypt your backups (by selecting the \"Encrypt iPhone backup\" option in iTunes), your device's keychain will not be transferred to the new device. For non-encrypted backups, the keychain is only preserved when restoring onto the same device you backed up from.\n\nA: Yes, you can. You can restore a backup from an earlier version of iOS to the current one. (I had to do it a few times on test devices in the past.)\nIn those cases, what I had:\n\n\n*\n\n*Devices with iOS x-1 synced and backed up.\n\n*Devices restored to iOS x\n\n*Devices synced and data restored from the backups (as iTunes usually lets you do)\n\n\nYou can be very confident that in your case it will work.\n\nA: One other possibility would be to make sure her 3G and your 3GS have the same OS version, and then restore her backup to your device. Then upgrade the 3GS to iOS 5, take a backup and restore it unto the 4S.\nDoesn't look like this would be necessary in this case, but if all else fails, that might be a way to do it.\n", "Q: Are there any GameBoy Advance emulators for OS X Lion?

If this music was purchased through iTunes and all through the same Apple ID then they can be downloaded onto the computer through the iTunes store. For non-protected music on computer 1 you can just make a back up copy cd then load that cd onto computer 2. For any protected music you would need to make certain it was purchased through the same Apple ID and that computer 2 is an authorized computer under that Apple ID.\nKnow more about how to transfer or backup music from iPod to Mac, which included the detailed tutorials of how to transfer or backup your music from iPod to Mac.\nBest wishes.\n", "Q: Photo Stream access on pre-Lion Macs I have a machine not running Lion because of software Lion does not support. This machine is currently my primary household media hub, and it would be very helpful if it could take advantage of Photo Stream.\nhttp://www.apple.com/icloud/features/photo-stream.html indicates that Photo Stream supports both Macs and PCs. If there is a PC client, could pre-Lion Macs take advantage of it under emulation to access Photo Stream data?\n\nA: Yes - your example of running a supported OS in virtualization would let you use the officially developed and supported Apple client software to tap into the photo stream. Once you have the software running, it should be fairly painless to get the files to disk and then available for viewing on Snow Leopard.\nIt's technically possible to virtualize Lion as well while running Snow Leopard as the core OS, so you can choose if you want to use it or Windows OS to get your iCloud sync on.\n\nA: You've already provided half of the solution - but realize that it is definitely a hack-y, ugly work-around.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up VM (Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion) with a \"shared\" folder in the Mac filesystem.\n\n*Download iCloud Control Panel to Windows VM and configure it to save Photo Stream to desktop\n\n*Create a Folder Action with the \"Import Files into iPhoto\" action, optionally choosing to delete them afterward.\n\n\nA: No, pre-Lion Macs unfortunately can't have access to Photo Stream.\nEvidence: it is an iCloud feature, and iCloud setup specifies:\n\nMake sure your Mac is running the latest version of OS X Lion.\n  If you don’t have Lion installed, you can purchase it from the Mac App Store.\n\nIt might, IMHO, appear under one of these two scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple brings iCloud to Snow Leopard in an OS update.\nUnlikely, it is indeed a commercial argument for updating, and if they had thought it was strategic for them to increase the userbase, they could have done it earlier already.\n\n*PhotoStream is made accessible through the excellent iCloud webapp.\nMore likely, but still not so much in absolute terms. They know we'd have syncing tools for all OSs the day after it is released, and they'd lose the commercial advantage given above. Maybe when they know almost all potential upgraders have already upgraded…\n", "Q: Calendar backup while away from time machine I am occasionally away from my time machine disk. During these periods I would still like to backup my calendar in case the hard disk (MacBook's) crashes.\nWhich file or directory should I copy to backup iCal's entries?\nEdit\nI am looking for a maintenance-free backup method (i.e. one that does not require me to think about it until something bad happens).\nMight it be possible to sync iCal with a cloud-based (perhaps Google's) calendar? Is it possible afterwards to sync back into iCal?\n\nA: If you are running Lion, iCloud, launching in October 2011, will soon provide cloud-based back up for calendar information.\nTo manually backup iCal entries, Apple recommends that you either\n\n\n*\n\n*Save an iCal Archive on your hard drive (File » Export » iCal Archive...)\n\n*or\nExport an individual calendar to a file on your hard drive (use this method for any CalDAV calendars) (File » Export » Export...)\n\n\nTo protect against hard drive failure, copy the resulting files onto external media.\nIf you wanted to sidestep the Apple recommended process, and simply back up a single folder, it appears your calendar data files are stored in ~/Library/Calendars\nAdditionally, Google provides instructions for how to sync iCal with Google Calendar.\n", "Q: Macbook Ram Speed Question (1033 or 1333 MHZ) I have two 4GB modules of ram for a Macbook Pro (1033MHZ).\nI have a new Macbook pro that came with two 2GB modules (1333MHZ)\nWould it be best if I left the 4GB faster ram in? Or would it really be noticeable if I swapped it for the 8GB of slower ram?\n\nA: Depends on what you plan on doing with the machine but 9.99 times out of 10 you're better off going with more ram (8gb in this case), especially for RAM-intensive applications such as databases, virtual machines, music/video/audio/photo editing.\n\nA: You won't be able to notice the difference.

I want to pay the $25/year for iTunes Match specifically to get my thousands of low-bitrate tracks \"upgraded\" to high-bitrate.\nWill I be able to invoke the service, get high-bitrate tracks downloaded to my Mac, and sync it with my iPod Classic?  Or is it only for iOS/iCloud streaming?\n\nA: Yes, songs in your library that iTunes is able to match (either because you purchased them from iTunes, or because it recognizes them) will be available for download at 256kbps. Once downloaded, you will be able to sync them to your devices as usual.\nNote that the copy that is on your machine already will not automatically be replaced by the 256kbps version. To get that you may need to delete that version and then download iCloud's (high bit rate) version. Since the iPod classic isn't an iOS device, this should do the trick once you have a copy of the higher bitrate music in your locally stored music library.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. Once the cloud has matched your lower bitrate song, make a final backup and delete that song from your iTunes library. You can then re-download the \"standard\" version from Apple's servers.\n\nJason Snell has a great writeup on an easy way to keep track of the songs by using the power of smart playlists:\n\nMake a Smart Playlist Create a Smart Playlist with the following attributes:\n\n*\n\n*Bit Rate is less than 256kbps\n\n*Media Kind is Music\n\n*Any of the following are true: (to create this conditional, option-click on the plus button in the Smart Playlist window) iCloud status is Matched, iCloud status is Purchased\n\nDelete all those files Select all the tracks in your playlist, and then hold down the option key while pressing Delete. Be sure to not select the box that would delete them from iCloud!\nBring ’em back All those tracks should still be [in the playlist]—but now they’re marked as being available only in iTunes Match. Select all of them again, then control-click on the selection and choose Download.\n\n\nA: At http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/, Apple announces that \"It’s built right into the iTunes app on your Mac or PC and the Music app on your iOS devices.\" and \"Even better, all the music iTunes matches plays back from iCloud at 256-Kbps AAC DRM-free quality — even if your original copy was of lower quality.\"\nSo it looks like you're in luck, if the service as released has the announced features.\n", "Q: If I develop an app for iPhone or iPad, how much does Apple charge me? What fees does Apple charge iPhone/iPad developers? Is there an entrance fee so that the app is listed in the App Store, and some charges on each sold app?\n\nA: If you want to develop HTML5 web apps that run in Safari on your Mac/iPhone/iPad, it's free.  These apps can be designed as web clippings for your device as well.\nIf you want to develop Simulated iOS apps that run on the iPhone/iPad Simulator on a Mac, it's free (after the cost of your Intel Mac with Snow Leopard or Lion), or maybe $5 to download the tools from the Mac App store.\nIf you want to develop, install and run a native iOS app on any stock OS iPhone or iPad, you need to pay $99/annum to enroll in Apple's iOS Developer program.  \nIf you want to submit a native app or an app encapsulated HTML5 web app to Apple's iTunes App store, you need to be enrolled in the same $99 per year iOS Developer program.\nIf your app is a paid app that they approve for distribution from their App store, Apple pays you around 70% of what it charges the customers (less if there's a VAT tax).\nAdded: Starting with Xcode 7, and with a valid AppleID, you can use a personal profile to install apps developed using Xcode on your directly connected personal iOS devices, without paying $99 for an Apple Developer enrollment.  But apps installed this way are reported to have a short expiration date, around 1 week or so.\n\nA: There is a $99/year fee to be a member of the development program. If you are not a member, you can download Xcode and SDKs for publicly released versions of iOS and work on your apps, but you will only be able to run them in the simulator. If you want to be able to run the app on an actual device or enter it into the app store, you need to be a member. If your app is not free, or uses in-app purchases, Apple keeps 30% of any sales.\n", "Q: SSD Boot drive and encrypted HD Have an SSD installed in my MBP's optical bay.

I believe this is related to fseventsd, since it my try to log the errors on the root of the Ubuntu partition.\nHow can I stop fseventsd logging events on that Ubuntu volume?\nThank you!\n\nA: Preventing file system event storage\nWhilst you should not stop the daemon, you can disable logging on a per-volume basis. \nIn the Mac Developer Library\nFile System Events Programming Guide: File System Event Security: Preventing File System Event Storage advises: \n\n… To disable logging on a per-volume basis (for creating a backup\n  volume, for example), you must do the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Create a .fseventsd directory at the top level of the volume.\n  \n*Create an empty no_log file in that directory.\n  \n  \n  So if your volume is mounted at /Volumes/MyDisk, you would create an\n  empty file called /Volumes/MyDisk/.fseventsd/no_log.\n\n\nKernel panics\nPlease consider creating a separate question. \n\nA: OS X does not have a built-in ext3 driver so it's not possible to even access the Ubuntu partition from OS X.\nThere is a lot of information missing here making it impossible to correctly assess what is causing your kernel panic.\nAre you even using Apple hardware?\n", "Q: Possible to run scripts on sleep and wake? MacBook Pro 2010 running OS X Lion.\nIs it possible to run scripts on sleep and wake events?\nMy specific application is that I've got Dropbox-synced Truecrypt volumes that  I regularly use on both my MacBook and iMac. I rarely shut down my MBP since closing the lid is much faster and easier, but this means that I have to remember to dismount my Truecrypt volumes and let them sync back up before closing my MBP. It's trivial enough to script mounting/dismounting of them, but I'd like to go a step further and have these scripts run automatically.\n\nA: I developed the following simple Launch Daemon to provide a 'wake' trigger for scripts on Leopard:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>wake-alert</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/bash</string>\n        <string>-c</string>\n        <string>z=/tmp/wake; test -s $z || { date > $z; say w; }; \ntail -1 /Library/Logs/DirectoryService/DirectoryService.server.log | grep -v Sleep || > $z\n        </string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Library/Logs/DirectoryService/DirectoryService.server.log</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>ExitTimeOut</key>\n    <integer>2</integer>\n    <key>ThrottleInterval</key>\n    <integer>1</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou can replace 'say w' with your code. I write a date to z but you could change this to write anything. You may need to increase 'ExitTimeOut' for some scripts. My Launch Daemon resides at /Library/LaunchDaemons/wake-alert.plist\nThe Launch Daemon watches DirectoryService.server.log and writes to a temporary file provided the file is empty. The file is cleared by a log 'Sleep' entry and by Shut Down.\nIf you use 'fast user switching' to sleep you will find that scripts which require a logged in user will attempt to run too early and fail unless you modify the Launch Daemon - perhaps grep 'Succeeded' in 'secure.log'. \n\nA: Was interested in that question previously but didn't find any step by step guide on how to achieve it. \nSolution is based on open-source tool called sleepwatcher and apple launchd\nWas inspired by this article\nSo enjoy! :\n\n\n*\n\n*Install sleepwatcher => brew install sleepwatcher\n\n*At first create => ~/.wakeup and ~/.sleep scripts and put some shell logic into it\n\n*Add necessary permissions => chmod 700 ~/.sleep && chmod 700 ~/.wakeup\n\n*Test it locally => /usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher --verbose --sleep ~/.sleep - go to sleep with running terminal\n\n*If it works then load process as launchd agent for all users => /Library/LaunchAgents\n\n*Add symlink for sleepwatcher launchd task => sudo ln -sfv /usr/local/Cellar/sleepwatcher/2.2/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/\n\n*Load launchd task => sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility.plist\nHope it will help anybody :)\n\nA: I use Keyboard Maestro (https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/), no affiliation.\nIt can trigger an action when system goes to sleep or wakes up among tons of other features to ease working with Mac. \n\nI used the sleep/wake events to trigger a url that connects to an IOT device that I designed to control an external fan that I put on top of the Mac Mini (Mac is upside down).\n\n\nA: Another program which you might discover and be tempted to try is EventScripts.  Although it is a very impressive program which I would recommend in general, after testing it for this purpose it does NOT actually appear to be able to trigger scripts quickly enough for them to run before your Mac goes to sleep, and instead the sleep script will not run until after the Mac has woken up, which (obviously) defeats the purpose.  \nI hope to save you and anyone else reading this the hours of testing it took me to come to this conclusion.  I'm sorry to have to say that it failed, however, because in so many respects it is a really nicely designed and quite powerful and flexible program.  It's also quite inexpensive ($3).  The low-level performance just doesn't seem to be there, however, for running a script before sleeping.\nOn the other hand, in my tests (so far) sleepwatcher has appeared to be quite reliable and fast.  It's also free, which is awesome.  I'll keep testing and if I find it to not work sometimes I'll update my answer, and keep testing other options.\nUPDATE I have not found sleepwatcher to be consistently reliable since originally writing this answer, although it initially appeared to be working.  In my case I don't need to run arbitrary scripts, but instead just eject external drives.  I've found a small and inexpensive app that does this very well so far: Jettison.  This has very quickly become one of a small handful of utilities I can't live without.  If your needs are the same as mine, I think you'll find it well worth the few bucks they charge.\n\nA: SleepWatcher may be of use. \nFrom the description: It can be used to execute a Unix command when the Mac or the display of the Mac goes to sleep mode or wakes up, after a given time without user interaction or when the user resumes activity after a break or when the power supply of a Mac notebook is attached or detached. It also can send the Mac to sleep mode or retrieve the time since last user activity. \nIt's working fine for me on 10.6.8. Various versions are available to support 10.1(!) thru 10.7\n\nA: It appears that as the OS ships, sleep/wake cannot trigger scripts, but third party solutions have been developed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Scenario appears to be one such solution.\n\n*Power Manager also seems to add some script triggering abilities. I can see it can trigger scripts on wake from sleep and it can trigger scripts on sleep.\n\nI have no personal experience with these programs or their vendors.\n\nA: WakeWatcher is a simple OS X faceless background application I created to address this issue. It runs ~/.onwake whenever wake is detected. You can then put the commands to mount/remount your drives in that script.\nWakeWatcher is suitable for use as a login item. It is not very sophisticated, but it is free and simple.\nTo execute scripts on sleep would be a simple addition, but I'm concerned about the time available for the scripts to complete before the system actually does sleep. If you really need it, open an issue against the github project and I'll add it.\n\nA: This is my own app, so consider that, but ControlPlane has the ability to do actions based on Sleep/Wake. You'll find it at http://www.controlplaneapp.com/.\nControlPlane is a fork of MarcoPolo and has been updated to run on Snow Leopard and Lion.\n", "Q: What gesture causes the page to zoom in? Sometimes, when I am moving the mouse cursor on my Mac Mini, Safari zooms in the page. I checked the mouse settings, and the only gesture that would cause that should be the double-tap, which is not what I am doing.\nI have not noticed the same behavior with other browsers, or applications.\n\nWhat is causing Safari to randomly zoom in the page I am viewing?  \n\nA: It appears not the be the case for the Magic Mouse, but with the trackpad, there is a pinch to zoom gesture also. If another finger were touching the trackpad, one finger's movement could be interpreted as a pinch.\n\nAnother option is that some part of your hand is coming in contact with the mouse surface and is being interpreted as a double tap. If you turn off the double tap gesture in System Preferences, does the problem persist?\n", "Q: How can I make my very own OS X Lion Install DVD/USB Stick? I bought new MBP some days ago and it came with the lion installed on it. Now I am curious can I make an OS X Lion Bootable Disk?\nI read some tutorial to make an OS X bootable Disk if you download it from appstore, but if Lion was installed by factory on it how can I make a bootable disk?\n\nA: Open Terminal, and type this command to list all partitions on your hard drive or SSD: \ndiskutil list \n\nIdentify the \"Recovery HD.\" For example:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Filesystem              119.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\nThen run the following (replacing [ID] with your identifier (will most often be disk0s3).\ndiskutil mount readOnly /dev/[ID]\n\nSo the following would look like:\ndiskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk0s3\n\nThe disk image inside the Recovery HD partition has been marked invisible, so use the Terminal command to mount it: \nhdiutil attach /Volumes/Recovery HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg\n\nNow, from the newly mounted Mac OS X Base System Image, double-click the 'Install Mac OS X' application and proceed past the licensing agreement.\nChoose the external drive or spare partition when the installer asks where you'd like to install OS X Lion.\nOnce the installer completes the download, do not restart your system. Rather, quit the installer. If you restart, you'll likely lose the local Lion installer. Once you have the InstallESD.dmg in the Mac OS X Install Data folder, you can burn it to a DVD, or image it to a USB flash drive to create your very own Lion boot disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*This article was adapted from: How to get a full Lion install disc for a new MacBook Air or Pro\n\n*All credits go to: CharlesS\n\nA: You need to visit the Mac Up to Date WEBSITE and you can then get a code from the website to download Lion and create the bootable disk from there.\n", "Q: Detect Displays sets default wallpaper I have ext. monitor connected to MacBook.\nI use macbook with closed monitor most of the time, sometimes I need second monitor:   \n\n\n*\n\n*I open notebook's monitor\n\n*call Detect Displays to turn on monitor\n\n*and after that my wallpaper on external monitor resets do default\n\n\nHow can I prevent it?\n\nA: OS X saves unique wallpaper settings on a per-device (per-monitor) basis. The wallpaper setting you make when using only your laptop, vs. the wallpaper setting when you run the laptop in \"Clamshell mode\", vs. the wallpaper setting when you run with the lid open and external monitor connected, all have different wallpaper settings.\nThe solution to this problem is quite simply to run your computer in dual-monitor mode as you've listed, and configure your wallpaper settings. Now those specific settings will be remembered when you are running the same external monitor and built-in laptop screen configuration. Changes to this multi-monitor mode will not affect the other monitor configurations.\n", "Q: Will Adobe Flash be supported in iOS 5? I now own an iPod Touch 4 with iOS 4.3.5 on it. I jailbroke it a while ago, but since it made me too many problems I reset it and it's now locked.\nMy question is, will the new iOS 5 is going to support flash videos such as from megavideo.com?\n\nA: Flash videos, or more specifically, movies streamed via a Flash Object will likely never ever be officially supported in iOS as a first-party (built-in) feature.\nApple and Steve Jobs have a very firm stance against Adobe's Flash technologies, claiming that they perform poorly on mobile devices, cause the web browsing experience to be diminished, and drain battery life excessively.\nFlash is not an announced feature in iOS 5.\n", "Q: How can I manipulate several security settings from terminal? I want to change these behaviors from terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Auto-login\n\n*Showing password after screensaver and sleep mode\n\n*Go to sleep mode after x minutes\n\n*Enable screensaver after x minutes \n\n\nA: 1) Auto-login\nThat one is tricky. The default is saved in\ndefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser\nBut in order to turn it on or off, you need to do it as root.\nSet it:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser ShortName\nDelete it (turn it off):\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser\n2) Showing password after screensaver and sleep mode\nI've been trying to get that one to work, and I can't\nYou will see a lot of hints telling you that the answer is\ndefaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword 1\n\nor variations like\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 1\n\nand that should work, because if you turn it off via System Preferences, you will see:\n% defaults read com.apple.screensaver\n{\n    askForPassword = 0;\n    askForPasswordDelay = 0;\n    tokenRemovalAction = 0;\n}\n\nand then if you turn it back on via System Preferences, you will see\n% defaults read com.apple.screensaver\n{\n    askForPassword = 1;\n    askForPasswordDelay = 0;\n    tokenRemovalAction = 0;\n}\n\nBUT if turn it OFF and the quit System Preferences and change the setting using 'defaults write', when I re-launch System Preferences, it does not reflect that change.\nI'd really like to know the answer to that one (preferably without osascript, but if there is no other way, I'll accept it).\n3) Go to sleep mode after x minutes\nAssuming you mean \"have the computer go to sleep after x minutes\" you want:\nsudo pmset sleep 20\n\nYou can also use different settings specifically for when you are on battery (for MacBooks):\nsudo pmset -b sleep 10\n\nIf you want to specify never sleeping when plugged in, use\nsudo pmset -c sleep 0\n\n4) Enable screensaver after x minutes\n@Daniel's recommendation worked for me:\nsudo osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set delay interval of screen saver preferences to 30'\n\nYou can use 'sudo pmset displaysleep X' to have the display sleep instead of using the screensaver.\n\nA: The osascript command and the System Events application are your friends here. Basically, you will be calling AppleScripts from the command line.\nFor instance,\n  sudo osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set delay interval of screen saver preferences to 30'\n  sudo osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set automatic login of security preferences to false'\n  sudo osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set require password to wake of security preferences to true'\n\nThe first sets the screensaver to 30 seconds after the last action; the second disables autologin. The third requires a password for exiting the screensaver or waking from sleep (the settings for the two are linked). Exploring the System Events dictionary will help you put together the specifics you are looking for.\n\nA: Screensaver Settings\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist contains the system-wide settings which apply when a user account does not already have a setting for a given feature in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.MACADDRESS.plist.\nTo write to the system-wide file in /Library use\ndefaults write Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver\n\nTo write to the current user's file use\ndefaults write com.apple.screensaver\n\nThe value for a given setting in the user's file has priority over the value for the same setting in the system-wide file.\n\nA: Enabling auto-login using sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser ShortName no longer works in macOS Sierra.\nTry this instead: https://github.com/xfreebird/kcpassword\n", "Q: What is a good way to protect the home button on my iphone 4 so it doesn't get dust in it? I've already replaced a home button on my iphone 4 and I'd prefer not to have to do it on my iphone 4s coming next week.\nI'm looking for a way to protect the home button while obviously still making it usable.  Most screen protectors don't cover the home button. \n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not interested in a total case (otterbox is too big)\n\n*I don't want a screen cover per-se.  \n\n\nI think something like a screen protector that has some elasticity just over the home button/bottom of the front would work.  \nDoes anyone know a good solution?  \n\nA: I really like Gelaskins (http://gelaskins.com/) for this and have them on my 4 and iPad.  They're nothing but removable decals that help avoid scratching the device (no screen protection), so they don't get in the way of cases, sleeves, pockets, or whatever.  You'll see on their product shots the there is a little gap around the home button.  You don't have to take this off, which actually looks better anyway with an artistic skin.\nPlus, you can easily tell which phone is yours without doing something that would lower the resale value, such as engraving.\n", "Q: How splash-proof and knock-proof is the iPod nano? I'm looking at buying an iPod Nano with a watchband to use as a watch.  My concern is that as a watch it will have to take a certain amount of incidental knocks and splashes.\nI don't want to have the iPod die after every little tap, or a splash of water when I wash my hands.\nHas anyone had any experience with the durability of the iPod Nano?\n\nA: The iPod Nano can be knocked around pretty good and still keep going, but getting them wet is another story. The units have moistures sensors (much like nearly all of Apple's handheld line) are not to be got wet. The phone strap would provide some protection against this, but it doesn't make it water resistant or turn the device into an actual wristwatch capable of getting weathered. Washing your hands with the phone attached to your wrist would certainly get water in the unit (potentially leading to damage and inoperability) or at the very least, trigger the moisture sensors.\nAn iPod Nano is still an electronic device that should be kept clear of all water and as much perspiration as possible. If the moisture sensor is triggered, your warranty is void. With that said, the units are sealed quite well and would typically only allow water in the headphone jack and the proprietary cable connection port at the bottom (these are were the moistures sensors are located).\n\nA: I've had an Ipod nano for all of 12 hours. It fell from my pocket while I was standing at a pedestian lights and shattered. Not impressed with the durability at all!\n", "Q: Connect to an UPnP Server as guest I can connect to my UPnP file server (the server is my ASUS router actually) via Connect to Server (⌘+K) diagram in Finder (By the way this server don't show up in Network folder).

When I attach my external hard drive to it, I can only read rights. How to I get read and write rights?\n\nA: A common cause of this would be the external drive being formatted in NTFS.\nIf your external hard drive is NTFS formatted (a common Windows format), MacOS X can only mount it read-only. There are third-party add-ons that would allow a Mac to write to a NTFS, but out of the box, Macs can read but not write to this format.\n", "Q: Request for experience: when has having only 16GB on your iPhone inconvenienced you? Today I regretted having only 2 GB on my Shuffle, because it meant I could not store the three most recent episodes of my favorite podcasts; but so far I have never used the full 16 GB on my 2nd Generation iPod Touch.\nNow I am looking at replacing the iPod Touch and a very early Android cellphone with an iPhone 4S.  The contract will be $1680 over two years, so the $200 cost difference between the 16GB and 64GB model verges on negligible; but I care; I could get the small size and donate $200 to pancreatic cancer research.\nWhat are people doing with the second 16 or 48GB of storage on their iPhones?  Movies?  Whole music collections?  DOS emulators? \nPresumably people who have 16GB iPhones made that capacity choice based on what they thought their needs would be.  For those who subsequently discovered that 16GB was not always enough, what were the circumstances?\nFirst-hand answers are more useful than second-hand, though if you have a friend, colleague, or family member who frequently berates him or herself for being stingy with memory, the details would be useful too.\n\nA: Video Capture, more photos, larger image sensor and better camera on the iPhone 4S means I'll spring for 32. Even with iCloud and all the music streaming options, I find I always want 4 GB of core music (and another 2.5 of podcasts) with me. Having room for more serious app and book (PDF) storage will be very nice.\nThe 14 GB iPhone 4 I've used since it launched was sufficient except for maybe a handful of times where I wanted more space. Especially when using iMovie to assemble slide shows and short video updates on a longer trip. Also, if an apple keynote or other hour long video comes out, I don't have the space to accommodate such videos. \n\n\nThose are the few times when \"the 16\" wasn't enough for me. I now don't take several databases with me using bento and filemaker pro since I want more space for songs and camera footage.\n\nI initially thought of a white 32 iPod Touch and the smallest black 4S - but having all the space and speed in one package makes it more of a computer to me. I can grab a bluetooth keyboard and get short work done if needed. I'm also quite eager for AirPlay and a 4S.\n", "Q: How many Apple IDs should one household have? To date my wife and I share one Apple ID for all Apple purchases and devices. We currently own a first and third generation iPod, iPhone 4, and will own an iPad 2 in the morning. Thus far having the one account has not been an issue, but with more Apple purchases to follow at what point does it make sense to have more than one Apple ID? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having one or multiple accounts? If we each had an iPhone would multiple Apple IDs be required? What's the relation to iCloud?\n\nA: FaceTime can't be used to call each other on the same iTunes account, for this reason alone you must have a separate apple ID to make use of this great tool.\n\nA: Check out this excellent FAQ from Apple on Apple IDs and iCloud: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4895\nOf particular interest are the sections:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the same Apple ID for Store purchases and iCloud (recommended)\n\n*Using one Apple ID for iCloud and a different Apple ID for Store\nPurchases\n\n\nA: There is no limit and having more is not necessarily better. Having all your devices registered under one Apple ID has the benefit of having all your purchases pushed to them without having to manage multiple accounts. So your wife can enjoy an app on her iPhone 4 just the same as you can enjoy the same app on your iPad 2, without needing to purchase the app a second time (once for each device), or constantly logging in and out of various Apple IDs to install and update.\nI find it is always better to pool your purchases to one account and register your devices under that single account. Having multiple Apple IDs requires that one micro-manage each account (iTunes will only check for updates for the current Apple ID), which can be bothersome at the best of times and a nightmare at the worst of times.\nOne advantage of having separate Apple IDs, however, is that each account belongs to its respective owner and can be registered to their own payment methods. But if you share your finances, that is of little value to you.\niCloud is bound to its respective Apple ID, so if you have just the one, all the features of iCloud would permeate through any device registered to that account. That means if you downloaded an app on your iPad 2, it would appear on your wife's iPhone 4. You would also share documents, pictures, music, etc. (anything supported by iCloud and expressly enabled by you) across all your devices as well—email as well. iCloud would essentially unify them and their content.\nMultiple Apple IDs are not required. You may also find this article on managing multiple devices (although somewhat dated when iCloud launches).\n\nA: I actually think multiple ids are a good idea.  I too assumed that if I bought an app from one account the other account would not be able to use the app.  But if you sync the app from the same iTunes installation (Windows7 for me).  The paid app works on all the iOS devices. Facetime & Messages are also a great reason to have multiple accounts.  \n\nA: You can use one Apple ID for FaceTime across multiple devices that have distinct Apple ID for app purchase. I can contact my son's iPod Touch with my iPhone using the same ID, all I did was change what email I can contact him on because it's not a phone (gmail). Works perfect for us with no confusion.\n", "Q: The error \"Keychain \"login\" cannot be found to store ...\" When I start up my MacBookPro/osx/snow leopard , I get this error with yahoo messenger..\nWhat is this keychain thing?

Without more information, I cannot debug your problem further, but it sounds as if Yahoo! Messenger expects to find a saved password for your account with them in your keychain, and is not finding it. The program Keychain Access, found in /Applications/Utilities, can help you view (and edit) keychain entries.\n\nA: I just had the same issue in the brand new Mac I got today.\nTo solve it we just opened the Keychain Access tool and deleted the login keychain (it did not had an icon, signal for something strange happening).\nThen I rebooted the Mac and... voilà, rebooting solved it! Upon reboot it recreated a new working one.\nI suppose the first one had been created by some corporate setup tool as root and my user, despite being an admin, could not access / write to it.\n\nA: Just had this this morning. \"login\" showed as \"locked\" in Keychain Access and cannot be unlocked, lots of messages from various apps. iCloud strangely had Keychain de-activated on my Mac even though it was activated before.\nI read about Safe Mode boot as a potential solution and tried but that did not help in my case.\nI copied the Keychain Folder in Library to have a backup, I checked on my iPhone which had all the PWs.\nSo I reset the Keychain on my Mac, turned off Keychain sync on the iPhone as well (Mac was already off) and then turned it back on the iPhone again first and then on the Mac (asks for authorization from the phone), that synced the Keychain back to my Mac (there was an Apple article about syncing which contained that advice, i.e. turn the device with the PWs back on first).\n\nA: I had this problem today on macOS Sierra.  After experimenting, it looks like somehow my login keychain had been locked.  I fixed it by selecting the Keys entry under category in the left hand pane.  I was prompted for my password to unlock the login keychain.  I then had to reboot.\nThe symptom I saw was that the login keychain had a locked icon beside it rather than an unlocked one.  I suspect you can simply unlock the keychain.\n\nA: In my case, I had created a temporary keychain marked as default, after which other Apps started complaining with error \"Cannot be found to store..\"\nResolved by:\nKeychain Access > on the left side Keychains panel > right click \"login\" > Make as default.\n\nA: Had the same issue with my MacOS Monterey. I opened the application Keychain Access\nThen on the menu bar Keychain Access > Preferences\nFinally I clicked on reset Default Keychains, confirmed with password and voilà\n\nA: When attempting to follow Dave's suggestion on Monterey, I'm having all sorts of very bizzare things happen:\n• Upon login, \"keychain not found,\" ask to reset it. Enter password (which is accepted) but the keychain is not reset.\nNow, using \"Keychain Access ... Preferences ...\":\n• \"Enter the login password for (the owner...) to allow this.\"  The correct(!) password is refused. (I logged-in again just to make sure.)\n• Password is accepted but, \"file not found\" message appears.\n• An apparently-different authentication sequence occurs but \"authorization not obtained.\"\nIn every case the keychain is not created nor reset.  I have =NO= idea what might be going wrong.  Especially when sometimes different things happen at different times.  Anyone else out there experienced this? And, what did you do?\nIt's just a keychain. It's supposed to be simple ... and how can the (erroneous) sequence of events be different sometimes?!  I didn't think computers did that.  And \"login\" does appear in both lists.\nP.S.: The \"Lock/unlock\" choices for \"Login,\" whether under \"Default keychains\" or \"System keychains,\" are grayed out.\nThis user is not an Administrator. (My everyday users never are.)\nI see no \"repair keychain\" option anywhere in the utility.\n", "Q: Can I use any Apple power adapter with my MacBook? There are 45, 60, and 85 watt power adapters for the MacBook line of portable devices (the Air, the Pro, etc.). Does the 45 watt charger which comes with the MacBook Air work with the 15\" MacBook Pro for example?\n\nA: You can use it, but how much actual charging goes on may be minimal. It depends how much power your MBP is drawing (i.e. if you're doing CPU or graphics intensive tasks, you'll draw more power, thus less charging), but I suspect the 45W won't do much more than slow the rate of battery drain. If your MBP is asleep or turned off, it should charge the battery, just slower than the standard charger.\n\nA: Also note that a Pro with a completely discharged battery will not be able to start up off a 45W or 60W adapter at first - I know from first-hand experience that a 60W can charge a 15\" Pro's battery enough after a few minutes to allow booting.\n", "Q: iMac forgets brightness When I set my brightness on a 27'' iMac (2011) next time it boots up, it's dimmed. I switched off the ambient sensor, so this shouldn't be the problem. The connected Cinema Display remembers the brightness correctly.\nHad anyone the same problem and found a solution?\n\nA: I have heard a few people complain of brightness resetting on reboot. Traditionally brightness settings are stored in the PRAM, which you can reset via ⌘⌥PR on booting. I would be interested to see if it gets \"stuck\" on a brightness setting that you do not wish to have after resetting the PRAM.\n", "Q: How can I download a webpage to a PDF in Terminal? I am trying to find a way to download an URL and convert it into a PDF.\nI have found lots of suggestions on how to turn PDFs into HTML or HTML into PDFs, but that's not the same as what I want to do.\nBasically I am looking for the same result as if I had opened the page in {insert browser of choice} and selected \"Print\" and then PDF » Save as PDF…\nBut I want to be able to do it all from Terminal, automatically, so that I can feed it a handful of URLs at once and have it do it all for me.\nI don't need or want recursion to additional pages.\n\n[Note: I have tried wget --page-requisites --convert-links but it does not always actually fetch images which are loaded from a remote server.

My Huawei mobile broadband E173 data card is giving me problems. After inactivity for some time, it gets disconnected and when I connect again, it shows as connected but sites don't get loaded. Even the default startup page that's supposed to start on connection is not able to load.\nI am using the default driver that came with the device. Are there any alternative drivers?\n\nA: I had a similar device. I will just post some insights I got using that.\nMostly I remember it didn't work when it wasn't plugged in at boot time. But I remember also similar problems as you describe.\nCould you check next time it occurs to you quickly reboot and see if the problem persits?\nActually after some trying I found out that I could not only connect through the Huawei software, but also through the built in modem program of Mac OS. In the Network settings the modem showed up and I could connect from there - even automatically. This turned out less prone to problems. (How do you connect?)\nAlso I remember it was not easy finding current drivers (my provider didn't have any for Mac). In the end I ended up downloading the most current from another network provider and manually inputing the correct settings.\n\nA: It's a problem with your network. Try another SIM provider.\n", "Q: Proxy settings won't be saved in the Keychain On an Ethernet connection, when I manually set my proxy information, it won't save correctly in the keychain for HTTP web proxy.

Since it was the same IP address, using the up and down arrow didn't show that multiple lines were entered.\nI removed everything, pasted the IP a last time, and now it works :)\n", "Q: iWork Numbers evaluate string I have a cell with the following content 2262/4121. I want to have a cell next to it that contains the result of that expression. Is there a function for that?\n\nA: You can use the VALUE() function for that. Its only argument is the cell that you want to evaluate\nFrom the documentation:\n\nThe VALUE function returns a number value, even if the argument is formatted as text. This function is included for compatibility with tables imported from other spreadsheet apps.\nVALUE(source-string)\n  source-string: Any value.\nNotes\n  You’ll never need to use the VALUE function in a new table, because numbers in text are automatically converted for you.\nOnly the formatted text is converted. For example, if you type the string $100.001 into a cell, the default format will display only two decimals ($100.00). If VALUE refers to this cell, it will return 100, the value of the formatted text, not 100.001.\nIf the argument can’t be returned as a number value (does not contain a number), the function returns an error.\nExamples\n=VALUE(“22”) returns the number 22.\n=VALUE(RIGHT(“The year 1953”, 2)) returns the number 53.\n\n\nA: In the general case you're stuck. But in a special case you might be able to do something.

Is it possible to use the iPad 2 as a kind of oversized mobile phone for everyday use?\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the 3G functionality available in some models?\n\n*Using VoIP through WLAN?\n\n*Using other means? \n\n*With or without additional gadgets like headsets\n\n\nand I mean not just theoretically possible, but really feasible with decent audio quality and a pleasant experience even for long calls. \nDoes anybody have experience with this?\n\nA: There are numerous possibilities outside Skype.\nFirst; the iPad fully supports the three ring headset that Apple sells. Both the stock Apple Earphones that ship with every iPhone, and even the Apple In-Ear Headphones. Meaning that you can use third ring microphone for any/all input methods. And, of course, all iPads have built-in speakers and microphones, so you can even use it in a \"Speaker Phone\" style of use.\nIf you have access to a Asterisk or similar SIP PBX server, then you have access to a myriad of Softphone applications, many of which are very capable and support all the latest features (namely backgrounding) including 3G calling where applicable. Take a gander at AppShopper.com's list of results when searching for \"softphone\".\nWhile not an official recommendation because I haven't used it personally, I do give a nod to Counterpath's Bria app, because I've used Counterpath's SIP clients on the desktop for years.\n\nA: As long as you restrict yourself to Skype it might just work. The recent Skype update brought Bluetooth support so you could just use a headset to make phone calls. \nOrdinary phone calls are not possible though, even on the 3G models (they only support data connections). \n", "Q: Why won't scanner show up for Scanner Sharing? I have an HP ScanJet 4890 connected via USB to my desktop Mac Mini running Lion. Recently, HP finally! updated scanner drivers and my scanner is recognized and works on that machine (connected to a powered USB hub). But I unable to set up scanner sharing. There are two related problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I open Print & Scan system prefs and and click the '+' to add the scanner, the scanner does not appear. I tried first starting the HP scanner app, but the scanner still doesn't show up in Print & Scan prefs. I also plugged the scanner's USB cable directly into the Mini instead of the powered USB hub, with no change.\n\n*Probably due to #1, if I enable Scanner Sharing under Sharing prefs, the scanner does not show up for selection.\nFYI, I do have other devices - a fax modem and a printer - connected via USB to the Mini, and both are recognized and shared over my LAN.\nI've searched through Apple StackExchange, but haven't found anything addressing this problem.\nSuggestions?\n\nA: I also have a HP ScanJet 4890 and it has never worked natively with neither Snow Leopard nor Lion. The fixed communication to the HP software seems to be by design. As @kremalicious says, that also makes it not work with built-in tools as Image Capture or Scanner Sharing.\nWhile I can live with that, it's quite annoying to wait more than a few months for new working HP drivers and software after a new OS X version is released.\n\nA: This looks like there isn't a correct driver installed for your scanner. This means the scanner can only communicate with the provided software but not with the system and its built in tools like Image Capture or Scanner Sharing.\nA basic rule of thumb: if the scanner doesn't show up in Print & Fax, all else won't work. Did you check all the downloads on HP's driver page for your scanner? You should download the Scanjet software (NOT Photosmart, that's for older systems) and the update at the bottom for Lion, this should include the driver.\nThere's of course the possibility HP doesn't provide a correct driver so that communicating with the vendor software only could be by design.\n", "Q: Problem with malicious Traffic in my MacBook I have been receiving warnings from my internet provider for a month now.

Every time i write ... in a text editor like TextEdit or Coda, Lion has started replacing it with a single Ellipse character, which doesn't encode to HTML. This started after I upgraded to Lion and happens across multiple programs. This persists in the latest Big Sur betas.\nAny idea how to stop it?\n\nA: On older OS X, you could see and disable this autocorrection, but now the interface is similar but you have to add this entry to manage it.\n\nMake three periods generate three periods.

I am thinking about installing another internal 1tb hard drive, and still using the external drive I have. I am guessing that it will backup until there is not enough space on the external drive. I am not going to backup all of the folders to the drive so the two drives combine (both internal) should never reach 720gb. Is my hypothesis correct? Can time machine handle this?\n\nA: Yes, Time Machine will backup until it fills the backup disk and then it will start overwriting old backups to make way for new ones.  However, if the volume of data you've told Time Machine to backup exceeds the size of the disk Time Machine is using to save the backups on, it will complain that the disk is too small.  If you have a Time Machine disk which is smaller than the combined size of the hard disks used by your Mac, it's likely you'll need to manually intervene at some stage due to this issue unless you're very diligent about ensuring that you don't ask it to backup too much data.\n", "Q: How do I sync MobileMe with Outlook 2011? I have Outlook 2011 on my running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. I managed to import the mail, calendar and contacts without an issue. Under Outlook > Tools > Sync Services I selected calendar, contacts, tasks and notes. I also selected \"On My Computer\" and the box shows the Outlook folder to add new items to on my computer.\nMy MobileMe preferences have also all been selected and I've tried syncing several times, yet, when I add a new contact, I se eno merging of the data on MobileMe or my iPhone 3.\nHow do I get MobileMe and Outlook 2011 to sync correctly?\n\nA: Outlook, like Entourage before it, isn't setup to support MobileMe natively as an account that it will sync more than Mail with.  I understand you eventually want to get data to your iPhone, but Apple's central MobileMe service just can't talk to Outlook as you're hoping, which I will now attempt to explain:\nIn the past, syncing other types of data than mail was accomplished by setting up MobileMe in each of the corresponding apple apps(iCal, Address Book) and then enabling SyncServices in Entourage to have it push and pull updates to the data.  With Outlok 2011's release, only contacts were supported via Address Book, and mishaps were reported when Calendars were eventually turned on:\nhttp://www.pcworld.com/article/224461/microsoft_blames_apple_for_outlook_2011_sync_snafu.html\nThe moral of the story is Microsoft has shown little excellence in the area of email clients besides the ones on its platform(Outlook for Windows) talking to its mail service(Exchange).  Apple will have the best clients for its service, even if it is spread across multiple apps(unless you choose to use the web interface for everything).\nMore background on what was available, and one report on using 2011 with sync services:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/155727/2010/11/outlook2011faq.html\nand\nhttp://www.scrubly.com/blog/index.php/2011/01/how-to-sync-outlook-2011-for-mac-with-mac-address-book/\n", "Q: How do I enable \"Network Trash\" on a file server? I have a Synology SAN/file server. One of the reasons I bought my Synology was that the reviews said it supported \"Network Trash\" for the Mac, so I can drag files to the trash and then drag them out without having the annoying message that files are deleted immediately. I can't find instructions on how to set this up.\nCan somebody tell me how to set this up?\nIs it specific to the Synology, or can any remote file server be made to do trash properly?\n\nA: The Synology NAS supports a Network Recycle bin, but only for SMB volumes. Therefore if you want to make use of it from your Mac, you need to access the share via SMB and not AFP. This can be enabled from the Control Panel under Win/Mac/NFS.\n\nThe Synology by itself fully supports Time Machine, and can act as a Time Capsule. Most of the documentation on the Internet mention the Network Trash and Time Capsule option in the same place, but as an Windows/Mac comparison type description. The manual for DSM does not mention Network Trash for Mac either, only for Samba.\nI am not entirely sure where you read that the Synology supports this feature for OSX, since I couldn't find any reference to it in the way you described.\nOSX, unlike the previous OS 9, does not support a Network Trash of any kind, and I am not aware of any plans to bring this feature to OSX. Therefore it also can't be activated from the OS layer. \nI suspect the naming was changed from Network Trash to CIFS Recycle Bin in the new DSM by Synology because of the confusion it has caused.\n\nA: I haven't used the software you are quoting specifically, but there is a report of a user having a similar problem on their forums, and what he did to resolve it:\n\nLook for the tickbox in the web management UI under File Sharing --- Win/Mac OS - http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=111&t=20444\n\nThe actual option turns on CIFS, and it looks like they are doing this with the SMB protocol only, not natively with AFP.\n\nA: Here's a workaround that might be a solution for some people.\nMake a new folder titled something like 'Network Trash' - either on the network (if others may need to access the trashed files), or somewhere in your Mac's user folder (probably better in most cases).\nSet up a Workflow in Automator to Move Finder Items to this Network Trash folder.\n\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard > Services set up a shortcut for this Workflow.\n\nYou will still have to periodically move the contents of Network Trash to the \"real\" Trash (not so bad for people who don't empty frequently). Or if you want to geek it up a level you could create another Automator Workflow that will do a Run Shell Script action to recursively delete the contents of Network Trash.\nYou can even borrow the Trash icon for your Network Trash folder by copy-pasting between Get Info windows, and drag it to the Dock to make a shortcut next to your system Trash. (Dark Theme doesn't carry over, and the icon won't update when empty, but close enough)\n\nThis way it works by both drag-drop and a keyboard shortcut, and feels almost the same as the Trash we know and love.\nOne limitation is that files of the same name cannot be copied over, so occasionally you may need to append something to the file name before trashing.\n", "Q: Disable Inverted Scrolling using Mighty Mouse I currently use two 2011 iMac's equipped with Mighty Mouse - the round mouse with a rubber scroll ball. When I go to scroll through pages or folders though, it is inverted. By this I mean that down is up, and up is down. I have been told there is a \"natural scrolling\" option somewhere in the settings, but I have yet to find it, only mentions of using it with the trackpad. How can I disable the inverted scrolling using a Mighty Mouse?\nI am running OS X Lion. The mouse is wired \n\n\nA: Simon, assuming your mouse is connected, the screen should look like the one below.\nUncheck \"Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating.\"\n\n\nA: Lion did change this on you.\nDepending on what hardware you have connected, the mouse pane, the magic mouse version of the mouse pane and the trackpad preferences all have a toggle to show if \"Natural Scrolling\" is enabled or disabled.\nIf you want your finger moving up on the mouse wheel to move the scroll thumb up (and the document down) just like Snow Leopard, then un-check the box to the left of Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating\n \n\nIf you have other pointing devices (and those reading along at home), hop over to confirm that one setting governs direction on the Mighty Mouse, the Magic Mouse and Trackpad preferences - scroll direction carries over to all input sources.\n \n\nA: System Preferences > Mouse > Top Middle \nCheckbox for turning off natural scrolling\n", "Q: How do I make an exact back up of one iPod Touch to another iPod Touch? I want both iPods to be identical- including the folders and organization I have already made on the first iPod.  \n\nA: Sync the iPod so it creates a backup of it. Take the 2nd iPod and restore it. When you finish the restore and it begins the setup on iTunes, select that it restores as a backup of the first iPod that you just synced. From then on out you can just sync each iPod every time you add new music, etc. \n", "Q: What monospace font is most legible at the smallest size? Does anyone know which monospace font in the Terminal program or iTerm is the best to use at very small font sizes?\n\nA: My choice would generally be Lucida Grande or Anadale Mono; Some days I'm more in the mood for Monaco though too. If my eyes start getting tired I ditch the small fonts for a few days if possivle. Depending on the shell I'm running, I've had Anadale Mono cranked all the way down to 5 point and still readable (provided I have access to an electron microscope as backup).\n\n\nA: This depends somewhat on your definition of \"best\" and \"very small size,\" but at 9 or 10 points, I'd have to give a shout out to Monaco, one of the fonts from the original Mac. The font is bitmapped so it is specifically designed to be readable at 9 and 10 points (that said, Terminal doesn't take advantage of the bitmapped 9-point Monaco, and scales the vector version instead -- I don't know what iTerm does. You can tell the difference because the bitmapped 9-point Monaco has a rounded capital A, but the bitmapped 10-point has a pointy A.). In general, a bitmapped font well crafted for a particular number of pixels will display better at that size than a scaled vector font.\nGetting smaller than that, Monaco loses its edge. Subjectively, I find Menlo, the default Terminal font in OS X Snow Leopard and beyond, to be much more readable at 6 point than any of the other monospaced fonts on my system.\n\n\nA: Inconsolata-dz at 7pt is still legible to me on my MacBook Air (1440 x 900 x 32) in iTerm, if I use anti-aliasing.\nI'm not saying that I'd actually choose to use it for any length of time, but if I had to… I could.\n", "Q: How do I install QuickTime 10.1 on Snow Leopard? I haven't upgraded to Lion yet and was thinking of keeping this Mac running Snow Leopard and buy a new Mac with Lion.\nSo I hope to install the newest QuickTime 10.1 on the current Mac running Snow Leopard.  It already has QuickTime 10.0 (128) so it can record the screen as .mov, but it can't select a region on the screen to do the recording like on a Lion Mac in the Apple Store (which has QuickTime 10.1).  (so QuickTime 10.0 must record the full screen, it seems, and the duo core CPU is not powerful enough).\nBut I don't see any upgrade link inside QuickTime's about or help, and I don't see it on Apple's website (only QuickTime 7 is available).  Is it possible to upgrade to QuickTime 10.1 on Snow Leopard?\n\nA: Snow Leopard already comes with QuickTime X. And as for trying to port Lion's version to Snow Leopard, that can't be done. QuickTime is a core component and like any integral piece of software, requires many libraries and APIs only available on Lion. It's not as simple as trying to copy over the contents of an .app bundle.\n", "Q: How can I play Blu Ray discs with my MacBook? I'd like to buy a Macbook Pro 15 inch instead of a Dell, and I know I can send video to the HDMI TV using the Moshi adapter.\nMy MacBook doesn't have a drive for Blu Ray discs. Is there a way to solve this?  I kind of want the navigation of chapters and extra features in a Blu Ray disc, so if using makemkv and a Sony external Blu Ray drive to make the Blu Ray disc into an .mkv file, that's not so preferred.\n(Is one possible way to use the Sony external BD drive (about $180), and use bootcamp to boot up Windows 7 instead?  Although this method is not so preferred because it needs to boot up only Windows)\n\nA: VLC 2 on Mac has experiment support for BD playback. That should work with an external drive of your choice. If you don't need a native player, you can always run a VM and have your pick of Linux or Windows Blu Ray player software. \nVlc can't play decoded commercial Blu-ray discs as I know. But Macgo have got the BDA license already and can decrypt Blu-ray codes legally.\n", "Q: Which one is faster? iMac 27 with Quad Core i5 2.7GHz or a Macbook Pro 15 with Quad Core i7 2GHz? They are about the same price ($100 difference, iMac $1699, Macbook Pro $1799), and\niMac: Quad Core i5 2.7GHz\nMacbook Pro: Quad Core i7 2.0GHz\nHow can you tell which processor is faster?\n(the iMac shows 4 processors in the Activity Monitor, while the Macbook Pro shows 8 processors)\n\nA: They are the same, or the i5 would be infinitesimally faster, which would translate into no real world difference (certainly none above perceptual thresholds).\nThis article compared the i5 750 (2.66 GHz clockspeed) vs. the i7 860 (2.8 GHz clockspeed). Data shows the i7 inched ahead by an average of a 3% performance improvement on the whole. Make note that this is a lopsided comparison in favour of the i7 (if only marginally). The Macs you list would favour the heavier clockspeed on the i5. The i7 has hyperthreading (hence seeing the 8 cores) but that doesn't do enough to give it a substantial lead.\nThe article also shows the i5 outperforming the i7 in power consumption, which should be a deciding factor when buying a notebook.\nBut at the end of the day, you are comparing a notebook with a desktop, so it's a little lopsided. The iMac has a much better video card and a larger screen with a higher resolution. There is much more to a system than the CPU. On a whole, the iMac is a faster (better) machine, but not portable.\n\nA: Faster is not objective category since it always should be asked faster for what?\nGeekbench in 64bit mode gives ~ 8600 for Intel Core i5-2500S 2.7 GHz (4 cores) and ~9500 for Intel Core i7-2635QM 2.0 GHz (4 cores)\nby this numbers alone we should say Macbook Pro is faster, right?\nBut Geekbench only take processor, cache and RAM speed into account.\nWhat does it mean is for example encoding video in well threaded application (let's use Handbrake's h.264 engine as an example) MBP will finish around 10% faster if we abstract from i/o speed (hdd or odd)\nBut in a case of not so well threaded application (Adobe Photoshop for ex.) iMac's faster clock will probably gives better results.\nAnd since iMac's HDD is a bit faster than MBP's one this will also add to a difference.\n", "Q: Typing in 2 different applications at the same time I am typing code on Google Docs through Chrome. What I want is for an app to enter whatever I type in the Google Docs into an open XCode editor. This way while I am done typing code I can check for errors. The hard way is to finish coding and select everything and then copy and paste.\nIn short: I am looking for an app that helps you type in 2 different applications at the same time.\n\nA: As far as I know no, mostly due to the way the OS X window manager is setup you need to have the text area to have focus to receive key input (but not all key events). \nHowever, this is not to say it's not possible, but I can't think of a way to do it 'live', as in sending the text char by char. If I was looking at doing it basically what I'd be trying to to basically keylog myself (list of keyloggers), and hack a script to switch to Chrome, dump the text and switch back to Xcode, but that's about as gracefully as I can think of and even that's a pretty ugly way to do it.\nThere's probably a nicer way to do it, but I'd start with the keylogger and build from there.\n", "Q: How does iPhone toasting/bumping apps work? I've just seen the ad for IKEA Skål!. If you haven't seen it, you can see the video linked. Basically, you can choose a drink and make a toast-like gesture (using the iPhone) with another person having the app. This results in both phones automatically exchanging names and photos, and optionally both of them will share the picture of their toast on Facebook. The ad is really nice, but I am curious about how it works. \n[Edit]: As a commenter pointed out, there is also another application Bump, which use the same technique to perform similar (and even more) functionalities. The FAQ stated that this application was designed with personal and data security in mind, and uses various sensors and algorithms to \"feel\" the bump and the server will find matching bumps according to the sensor reading and algorithms.\nHow exactly does the iPhone know that I am toasting/bumping with another person? I mean I don't think GPS can track the phones that accurately. And how does it transfer the contacts and photos? And how can it correctly determine who is toasting with whom if there are multiple users in the same room? How is the security and confidentiality protected?\n\nA: I don't have the facts to back this up, but my guess is that when the app is open it's searching for other open apps on bluetooth or local wi-fi. Then perhaps the physical \"clink\" is registered by the accelerometer and its timestamp matched with your friend's app.\nI don't think this is meant to be that serious of a thing in the first place, so there's likely not that much security (and it would totally kill the mood if you had to exchange passkeys or something in order to make a stupid Facebook post). Of course, the fact that the iPhone is a closed platform and the App Store is regulated is some measure of security--no one would be able to distribute an app that harvested contact information from the Toast app. The Toast app probably only shares when it's running and active in the front.\n\nA: In the case of Bump, the application communicates your approximate location with a cloud service. When you bump two phones together, they transmit some information to the Bump servers, including sensor readings from your phone about the timing and force of the bump to the service. The system uses your phone's GPS and cell phone location services to identify what other phones are physically close to yours at the time of the bump, then uses the specifics of the actual bump itself to resolve any possible duplicates. Once a positive match is made, the service then sends the appropriate information to the devices. \n", "Q: Migrate data from iPhone 4 to iPhone 4s I have a Verizon iPhone 4. What the easiest way to migrate my data & settings from the iPhone 4 to a new Verizon iPhone 4s [I'm expecting one in a few days]?  I want my new iPhone 4s to be just like my current iPhone 4 but with IOS5.   \n\nA: Plug in your old iPhone 4. In iTunes, right click on the device in the left column. Choose \"Back up\" from the listing. When the back up is complete, disconnect the device.\nNext, plug in your iPhone 4S. Pull up the context menu again but this time choose \"Restore from Backup...\" and choose the most current back up from the list.\n\n", "Q: Can a Macbook dual boot Snow Leopard and Lion? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDual Boot Lion / SL \n\nMy Macbook currently has Snow Leopard on it.  I'd like to try Lion as well, but is there a way to make it dual boot either one, perhaps using BootCamp?\n\nA: Yes, it can dual boot, and no, you don't need Boot Camp. Back up your system first, in case anything goes wrong. Create a second partition. When you download Lion, you'll need to download it without installing, then follow instructions on the web to create an install DVD or USB drive. Then, run the installer, and select the blank partition as the target for the install. When you boot, hold down option, and you can select which partition you want.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone allow Circuit Switched Data dial-up? I know CSD (Circuit Switched Data) is a really old technology and going to be obsolete. I just want to know: Does iPhone allow CSD dial-up like old mobile phones (without Jailbreaking it)? \nIf the answer is Yes, how do I configure it?\n\nA: In theory (totally theoretical) the iPhone does support CSD on the tech sheets, but you'd need your network provider to provision it onto your phone, and there's no apps in the app store that would allow you to do it due to the hardware access it'd need. \nYou could probably do it, but you'd need some jailbreak software and matching hardware which if you've got an engineering background wouldn't be impossible, but merely a pain in the backside.\n", "Q: Oxygen25 MIDI keyboard won't work with Pro Tools 9 I have Pro Tools 9.0.2 and a third Gen Oxygen25 MIDI keyboard connected by USB. Both are made by Avid, yet I can't get them to work together. \nThe keyboard even works with Logic Pro 9, just not Pro Tools 9.\nI'm running OS X 10.6.8 on a MacBook Pro (15-inch).\n\n\n\nA: You should contact the technical support people at both Avid/M-Audio and at Avid/Pro Tools (and unfortunately, in my experience, even though both companies are now owned by Avid, those divisions don't talk to each other much).\nThis is not the sort of problem that you can easily troubleshoot in a discussion forum like this one.\nOne thing that the tech support people at Avid will ask you: Did this combination of hardware and software ever work correctly, and now it is not working? Or have you never been able to use these together successfully?\n\nA: In the \"Peripherals\" setup on Pro Tools, you have the Send to setup wrong.  That is also supposed to point to your device.  (That is the MIDI send for the 8 channels in what you are assigning here as \"controller 1.\"\nSend to should be also set to Oxygen 25.\nThis is a fairly common error in Pro Tools and other DAWs.  After correcting this, maybe also trying other usb cables; and restarting your entire system, it should work.  You may also need to get a powered USB hub for consistent performance of music devices, especially since you are on a laptop.  I've seen that exact error and solved it by using powered USB hubs, fixing the basic settings, or replacing usb cables.\n", "Q: Limit the number of versions time machine stores of particular files Is there any way to limit the number of versions time machine keeps of files?\nIn this case, I want time machine to back up some of my Virtual Machines. However, Since VM images are very large and monolithic, using the VM results in a 25 GB file that has to be backed up in it's entirety again.\nHowever, I do want to have at least one version of the VM backed up, as a disaster prevention measure.\nIs there any way to limit the history-depth that time machine keeps for certain files? I really want the extended backup that you get of everything else. Just letting the time machine drive fill up, and lose the oldest backups to a bunch of giant VM images is not an acceptable solution\nIs there any way to modify time-machine backups using the terminal? I can see using some OS X cron analog to run a script that periodically deletes extra VM backups.\n\nA: Since you don't want no as an answer, and since Time Machine is proprietary software that you cannot modify you only have two options (don't complain, you asked for it)\n\n\n*\n\n*convince Apple to implement the missing feature\n\n*implement your own version of Time Machine\n\n\nYou could modify backups from the terminal or with the Finder: backups are just directories with hard links but beware that you will most likely make them unusable by Time Machine (as Time Machine relays on the fact that the backups are as they were created).\nThere is a function in Time Machine \"Delete all backups of\" which removes backed up copies of a file. You could research if this is scriptable (Apple Script or terminal). I had no luck but seems the only way to periodically clean up a backup (with cron or similar)\nYou didn't specify which virtualization software you are using. If it's VirtualBox there is a workaround to reduce the size of the backed up data using snapshots: http://blog.matteocorti.ch/?p=331\n\nA: Time Machine backups can be accessed like any other disk (more or less), so you could start with something like the following as root:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# root directoy of backup history\nTM_ROOT=/Volumes/Timebox/Backups.backupdb/Fourecks\n\n# path where VM data is stored (relative to $TM_ROOT/timestamp)\nVMPATH=Fourecks/Users/Shared/VM\n\n# stop backup (if any)\ntmutil stopbackup\ntmutil disable\n\n# get working\ncd \"$TM_ROOT\"\nLATEST=$(ls -l | grep -e '->' | cut -c 56-)\n\nfor dir in 2*; do\n    if [[ \"$dir\" != \"$LATEST\" ]]; then\n        # remove echo for destructive effect\n        echo rm \"$dir/$VMPATH/*\"\n    fi\ndone\n\n# enable backup again\ntmutil enable\n\nPaths will need changes (Fourecks is my local machine). For Snow Leopard, just leave out the calls to tmutil.\nCAUTION: I did not test this! You may also need chmod to change the ACLs of the files you want to delete (and the folder containing them) because the default ACLs for TM backups prevent you from deleting on shell level.\n", "Q: Message tone played multiple times on receiving message/notification on iOS 5 I've an iPhone 4 and I've installed iOS 5 on it. Since then, whenever I receive a text message or an app notification, the tone plays like \"tre..tre..tre..tre..te..tre..tre...tring\". Sometimes it takes a whole 5 to 7 secs for the sound to be complete.\nAt first, I thought it's because of the beta; but I guess they should've fixed it by now as it is already some Beta 3 if I'm not wrong!\nDoes anyone know any settings change/fixes that can fix it?\n\nA: Ok, I had the exact same issue after updating to IOS 5, SMS tones sounded like a stuck record and very garbled. Solution is back-up your iphone then do a complete restore and at the end set up as a new iphone NOT backup from previous. The back-up can cause glitches when 1st updating from 4.3.5 to 5. Then unplug and plug back in and right click your iphone and do a \"restore from back-up\" after the setup as new iphone.

This problem is blocking me from installing updates and packages from Cydia.\n\nA: \"System Storage\" refers to everything mounted on /, which is more than just /System. Cydia and SBSettings are not lying to you. The only way you can fix this is by removing packages in Cydia that take up System Storage, or restore with a custom IPSW that makes the System partition larger.\nSee Where is the dividing line (mount point) of the two iOS partitions?\n\nA: Another solution (if you have SSH and SFTP access to the iPhone) is to symbolic link some stuff from the system partition to the user partition. It's dangerous, but if you know what you're doing, it can save you some time. Always back up first.\n", "Q: How do I get Xcode 4.1 running under Snow Leopard? I'm trying to upgrade to xcode 4.1, but I it's not working as I expect. I am a registered iOS developer, so I downloaded the (huge) installer. When I double click, it appears to launch, but then it stalls -- nothing happens. There's no installer window with buttons to click, etc. I'm sure there's a better way to do the installation from the terminal and see what's really happening. What do I try next?\nAlso, I'm wondering if anyone has made this work with OSX 10.6.8 yet, as there were some descriptions of the installer crashing on the dev forums.

Any other ideas on suggestions on how to repair this?\nUpdate 2: I never managed to install xcode 4 on my macBook. The root of the problem seems to be that this was one of the earliest models of macBook to use the Intel processor. And XCode 4 doesn't seem to run well on this processor.

I've looked over similar questions and searched the internet to try to find symptoms of a bad hard drive, but I haven't found anything that seems to be related to my problem.\n\nI have a late 2008 15\" MacBook Pro. It has a Hitachi HTS723225L9SA62 250 GB HD. I'm running the latest Lion with all updates.\nRecently I've had a few computer failures; first, I was having issues with the computer locking up (staying eternally on the light blue screen—had to be hard powered off) when changing to the high-end graphics card in my MBP. The Apple Store initially suspected a RAM issue, as when they reseated the RAM, it temporarily fixed itself. The symptoms later reappeared, and they replaced the entire logic board.\nLess than a month later, my display stopped working. The computer worked fine, as did the graphics card, as long as I was using an external display. They replaced the display (about two months ago), and it's been working since.\nFor about a month now, my computer will hang at random times. Most of the time, it happens with Safari (this may be because it's my most-used application, though)—the UI is completely unresponsive, I can't quit Safari, I can't change tabs, I can't even click in Safari to switch focus to the window. This will fix itself and act normally after about 10 seconds. This also happens occasionally with TextEdit, iChat, and iTunes. I never had any issues with freezing until recently.\nI'm suspecting a possible hard drive failure, as I don't know what else would cause this, except perhaps memory issues. In the past I've had similar issues in an iBook G4 which were caused by the hard drive.\nI've ran the diagnostics utility on the install disc, and every test passed.\nDoes this diagnosis sound reasonable? What can I do to further test my computer's hard drive and other components?\n\nA: When i am having all sorts of issues like you describe, i try booting up from Disk Warrior and running its tests.\nFrom your description of symptoms I would suggest that it is a possibility your laptop could have directory, memory/RAM or even at its most extreme, motherboard issues.\nApple's Disk Utility only goes so far. Oftentimes the issues it discovers are caused by other problems from the machine. The best indicators I have seen to an HD failing involve files not being able to write to the disk, or files becoming corrupted. Also, if parts of the System files become corrupted, you would see finder and other system issues ... Like you described. A previous poster's suggestion of booting from another drive is a good one to eliminate this as a possibility. (I use an external HD instead of a memory stick.) \nThe absolute best safe guard against losing data on a HD is regular back-ups.\n\nA: Personally, I can recommend Smart Utility. It has accurately shown errors on my drives in the past. \n\nA: I'm a little late to this discussion, so I hope what I add will be of value to someone.\nThe problems you're having is why I use a product called Scannerz. There's a lot that can go wrong with a system, and it can't always be traced properly by playing a \"guessing game\" or swapping out component by component. Simple surface scans just won't cut it, especially if all they look for are I/O errors (which is all most do.)\nFirst, because I personally think the Scannerz documentation is somewhat confusing, allow me to explain it to you in a more \"real world\" example.\nSuppose you have an old LP (vinyl record) or a music CD-ROM that you play on a stereo system. If, every time you start playing a song on the media, and at 3min 21 sec into the song, if it's a vinyl record it skips, or if it's a CD it jumps around and malfunctions, then the problem is repeatable. It occurs every time you play it, and it occurs at the exact same spot in the song, so you're pretty sure (about 100% in fact) that the media is bad. The solution in this case is simple: replace the media.\nWhat if, instead of having a repeatable problem, it's erratic. Maybe the sound drops out with a pop on one speaker intermittently, maybe the sound comes on and off erratically, maybe there's lots of static or hum, but it apparently can't be traced to the media per se. What do you do? You start checking connections, grounds, cables, etc. and you troubleshoot it. Maybe it's a failure in the receiver itself.\nProblems with a computer system are somewhat similar. There's a lot that can go wrong with them. You could have a bad hard drive, a faulty drive cable, an intermittent fault in the supply connections to the logic board, but you can't find this out if the problem isn't isolated properly.\nA computer system differs from an audio system in that the audio components typically just throw their output to the next device without caring about whether or not the signal is received properly. Computers are different. They go through a process of handshaking before the events can proceed properly, and if the handshaking doesn't occur properly, the event may fail.\nAlthough many people think Scannerz is hard drive scanning software, it's fault detection software - it uses the progress of the scan on a hard drive as a reference point. Just as someone listening to a faulty recording media can determine whether or not the media is the problem because it occurs at the exact same spot, Scannerz allows you to determine whether the problems are related to the drive or somewhere else in the system because surface scan problems are repeatable, system problems are not. \nScannerz will detect a disk problem at the exact same spot if the surface of the drive has problems. However, if the problem is elsewhere, for example if the cable connecting the drive to the system has intermittent faults in it the problems, just like a speaker with intermittent connections in it will produce erratic and unrepeatable results. This is why Scannerz ability to use a cursory mode (this is Scannerz, not Scannerz-Lite which doesn't have these capabilities) is invaluable. If you run a test on a drive and it reports failures, you can re-scan them in cursory mode and if the problems repeat, you know the drive surface has problems. If they don't repeat, then you know the problem is elsewhere. Scannerz monitors system timing, and if problems are present, they'll be exposed either as errors or irregularities (the time it took to complete an event was out of bounds.)\nYou can isolate the problem by using path isolation. In your case, they've already replaced the logic board, so, unless you're extraordinarily unlucky, that shouldn't be the source of the problems. The remaining sources are likely the hard drive, the cable connecting the hard drive to the system, the supply and/or connections to the supply/battery, or the surfaces of the hard drive (i.e. your suspicion about the hard drive being bad are verified).\nYou can start isolating this by booting from an external FireWire or USB bootable media, unmount the internal hard drive using disk utility, and see if the system functions properly. If it works great using only the external media, then either the hard drive needs checking or the cable between the logic board and the internal HD is bad. If this is the case you'll need to get the software to test it (or make Apple test it for you, after all, they supposedly fixed it).\nIf the problems persist even using an external drive, it indicates that the problem isn't the internal drive or cable related, which pretty much points at the supply and/or it's cables (if there are any). Odds are when they swapped out your logic board, the didn't replace the cables, and if they were defective, the problems would persist, as they would if the drive's surface platters are defective. The test software Apple uses is simple surface scanning software and it won't necessarily be able to catch or verify intermittent problems.\nI hope this post is of value to someone.\n\nA: According to this article on Apple's support site, as well as this article on Macworld, OS X runs hard disk diagnostics on start up every time. You can also follow the instructions on this article at Apple's support site to manually use Disk Utility's First Aid feature and/or the command-line tool fsck to help you diagnose issues from the command line. \nThese built-in utilities should be sufficient. Having said that, there is a healthy third-party market for disk utilities. A few years ago, I purchased Data Rescue II by Prosoft Engineering (current version is Data Rescue III) and it helped me with recovering deleted files. I believe this same utility has an analysis tool as well. Hope this helps. \n\nA: My iMac started behaving unpredictably earlier this year. One good test was to create a bootable USB stick with OS X  on it (Snow Leopard at the time) and see how the machine behaved with that (this eliminates the HDD and so allows you to test RAM, etc). I ran up a diagnostic app that found many issues with the HDD and therefore replaced it. Not had any trouble since.\nGuide for creating a bootable USB stick\n\nA: I would also add that I've had great luck with Disk Warrior to recover a client's old drives full of video projects.  If the disk is too jacked to be fixed, it can build a preview copy, mount it and then let you use the mounted preview to copy / salvage files to a different drive.  Of course all of this would be unnecessary if the client had bought a backup drive for every drive I have and actually run the backups.  Running a video production business in Los Angeles, I've found that clients appreciate backups and often need to go back to their corporate video projects down the road for events and revisions, and backups are essential. \n", "Q: OSX virtual machines for Visual Studio and Azure I will be starting a new job in a couple of weeks, and I've been asked to spec out a machine I'd like to work on. As a UI Developer, I am much more comfortable developing in OSX.\nThe company I will be working for develops on .NET and deploys as an Azure cloud application. I know that I can run Windows as a virtual machine, but I need to make an informed decision about whether I will be able to smoothly run Visual Studio and run the Azure cloud application. \nAny thoughts? Performance issues? Workflow headaches?\n\nA: I program a lot in Visual Studio. I use parallels and Windows 7 and a MacBook Pro. Works great. You'll want to max out the ram on your machine, other than that you shouldn't have any problems.\n\nA: I would recommend putting the Windows VM on an external drive (preferably, Thunderbolt or FW800 based).  As others have said, make sure you max out the RAM of the Mac to be able to give Windows 4GB of RAM as well as the host the same amount or more.\n", "Q: I heard that Siri can be installed on iPhone 4 but can't find it in the App Store? Is it because it is a non-approved app on iPhone 4 and why?   If so, is it only installable if it is a jailbroken iPhone 4?\n\nA: The Siri app was withdrawn from sale to new people, but if you purchased it you can download it still from your history. It won't work without servers running, but you can still \"get the app\" from the store.\nThe app does nothing but check to see if the Siri servers are running. Since they are no longer operational - even people who have the app can launch it to see this announcement.\n\n\nA: The previous free Siri app for iOS was removed from the App store sometime around Oct 4.  (A developer can remove an app of theirs from sale at any time, and Apple purchased the developer of this app.)  This app (for people who downloaded it before its removal from the App store) itself announces that it will stop working on Oct 15, most likely because the old servers for its messy protocol will be taken down.  So the old Siri app will most likely stop working even if someone is able to install it.\n\nA: There are stories in the blogosphere that hackers have migrated Siri from the 4s OS code onto an iPhone 4. There was a video demonstrating it.\nIt's not for the masses. In fact, it had some substantial problems.\nThere was a story a day or two ago that Apple is working on releasing Siri for older phones (the story said iPhone 4 and maybe 3Gs). Then a story yesterday said that's not the case.\nIf you're Apple and you've just released a phone that is all new on the inside but looks the same on the outside, and has this one killer feature that revolutionizes everything... would you be in a hurry to put that feature on older phones? I wouldn't. You'd gut sales of your new device. You might bring that feature to older devices in maybe six months or something, but you'd for sure let it be a unique draw to your new device for a good while.\n", "Q: How can I execute sudo commands as a cron job? I'm trying to execute a shell script as a cron job. The problem is that my script needs to be run as a super user. I tried it with just writing sudo infront of the command in my crontab file, but it didn't work.\n\nA: Cron is not in any way deprecated, but LaunchD has more versatility and is used, and actively maintained/supported by Apple.  Their best practices guide is here\nLaunchDaemon jobs(versus LaunchAgents, which take on a users id) run in root's context without needing to enable the root user. All that is required is a properly formed XML file(you can just copy-paste pre-existing ones in /Library/LaunchDaemons, substituting your script for the ProgramArguments with the applicable schedule keys) with the proper ownership/permissions.  An older writeup can be found here:\nafp548's launchd-in-depth article \n\nA: It's a security risk, but you can enable the root user and run the command in root's cron. Alternatively, have you tried using sudo -s to get a \"root shell\" and making root's cron that way. Depending on your OS level, you might not need to have root enabled as a user for it's cron to run.\nIf you want to do it without enabling the root user (which is not really necessary in this case), you may (as any administrative user) enter sudo crontab -u root -e to edit root's crontab directly.\n\nA: Comment \"Defaults    requiretty\" from /etc/sudoers using visudo.\n", "Q: iPhone SMS: Same Contact, Different Phone Numbers Is there any way to differentiate between a contact with different phone numbers in Messages?\n\nA: Select the contact in the Messages app, then scroll to top and tap Contact Info.\nThe number to which this thread is sent to is highlighted.\nBut there is no way to know that from the \"homepage\", at least without jailbreaking.\n\nA: First, open the Messages app.\nNext, click the new message button in the top right of the screen.\nBegin typing the name of the contact you want to text and you will see a list of their different phone numbers.  Select the one you want to message.  \nYou won't be able to differentiate the numbers based on the name of the contact, but you will get a different chat thread for each phone number.\n", "Q: How to set default page size for Pages '09? I'm not sure how I can set the default page size for Pages '09. For some reason, every time I set the page size as A4, it defaults back to US Letter.\nI've tried setting these settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings: Save as default\n\n*Format For: Any Printer\n\n*Paper Size: A4\n\n\nBut the settings won't let me choose the 'save as default' option and goes back to Page Attributes.\n\nA: change the region under System Preferences > International > Formats.\nI believe that most of the region settings will cause Pages to default to ISO paper sizes (such as A4).\nThe only ones I know of which result in US Letter are United States, United States (Computer), and Canada.\nIf all you care about is the paper size for new blank documents, you can always save a custom template with your preferred page setup, use that, and not touch your system settings.\n\nA: You could go to System Preferences » Print & Scan and at the bottom of the screen, there is a dialog box for \"Default paper size\". Select A4 there.\nThis should change the default page size across all programs, not just Pages.\n", "Q: ffmpeg giving error on launch in Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1 I installed ffmpeg 0.8.5 in my Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1 with Homebrew\nbrew install --use-gcc ffmpeg\n\nIt installed without any error.

It comes and goes, but I haven't found out why or when.\nThe input cursor is displayed in a text field, e.g. the URL field in Chrome or Safari. When I type some text, nothing shows up. When I click with the mouse somewhere, the text that I typed shows up. If I continue to type, the same thing happens. Nothing shows up until I click the mouse. \nThere is another annoyance that I think is related. In a larger textbox, like the Xcode editor, the same thing happens, but when I click the mouse, it selects all text from where the input cursor is to where I click. Then it outputs the text that I typed, replacing what where selected.\nIf I click multiple times, it will always select all text from where I clicked to where I last clicked. \nI have no good strategy for solving the problem. Sometimes switching between applications solves it, other times I need to close the affected application.\nHave anyone experienced anything similar?\n\nA: Is it possible that the mouse button is sticky or not clicking properly? This would mean that the cursor could be someplace on screen but the software is trying to follow mouse movements and expects you to click again where you want the text to go. We did have a mouse button on a MacBook Pro that just would not function properly, although the problem was different – you had to pound it to have it register. We ended up with a Bluetooth mouse that works brilliantly. \n", "Q: What rtmp streaming software solutions exist? I've been doing some live streaming lately, and learned that Adobe's Flash Media Live Encoder is cross-platform. Unfortunately, it's been ludicrously unstable crashing occasionally during use, and always crashing when told to quit.\nAfter searching for alternatives, the closest I came was Telestream's Wirecast product, which despite it's \"affordable\" claim, is $450 I don't have, and about $400 worth of features I don't need.\nWhat I need in a rtmp/flash streaming client is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stability and a good native feeling client. Adobe's dark-grey drab interface is neither of these things.\n\n*A reasonable price. I'm willing to pay money, but triple-digits is pushing it. Free is always nice :).\n\n*Support for XML profile import. I'm unsure of any other specific term for this, but Nico Nico has a link in their streaming interface to download an XML file containing stream quality parameters, default device selection, and of course the URL of the streaming server. It's wonderful to simply tell FMLE to open this file, and then just click 'Start'.\n\n\nI have no specific requirements of 'effects' or generally ways to change the stream. I use CamTwist as a front-end device to set the video however I want.\nHas anyone used any other software fulfilling this purpose?\n\nA: Try influxis.com, it's web based but you could get your cam streaming pretty quickly. There are free options also like Red5, it's open source and it doesn't use FMS. \n\nA: 3 possible alternatives to using FMLE.\n\n\n*\n\n*Vidblaster Home is another alternative to Wirecast & FMLE.\n\n*Also, you could go the route of using a hardware encoder like Hauppauge Stream-ez Pro. \n\n*Finally, if your current hosting solution using Wowza Streaming Engine as their server side software, you can utilize a basic IP Camera like the Axis M1025 Network Camera.\n\nA: I setup nginx with the open source NGINX-based Media Streaming Server project recently and used Open Broadcaster Software to stream to it.\nI was able to watch the stream using both Kodi and VLC.\n\nA: I have worked for Influxis the last 4 years and I've learned that FMLE is actually quite stable if configured properly. What version are you using?\nMost all versions support XML profiles as well. What are your current settings? (format, frame rate, key frame interval, input size, bit rate etc.)\nThere's also many adjustments that can be done on the server-side to optimize how the data is written to the network layer specifically for live streaming.\n\nA: There is crtmpd, which does rtmp streaming for you. Red5 as suggested is another option, as is wowza media server.\nIf you don't need rtmp but want to use flash player, you can also use http streaming, which nginx does nicely.\nBeware that for full interaction, something like fms, red5 or wowza is required, the rest only streams, and that's it.\nIf you simply want to stream a webcam, check out QuickTime Broadcaster from Apple, combined with darwin streaming server. Both work on OS X. For even simpler options, there is EvoCam and you have options like YouTube Live as well.\n", "Q: Convert PDF to something editable without losing all formatting I am aware of solutions that allow one to extract text from a pdf file. Are there any practical solutions on the Mac to extract rich text and layout from a PDF, or somehow convert a PDF into some editable format without losing all formatting, and without multi-column layouts ending up with the text from each column interwoven?\n\nA: If you just want to edit the content of the PDF, Adobe Acrobat (full version) can do that. It can change/add/delete text, images, objects, etc.\n\nA: A good converting site is zamzar.com. Not perfect, but quite good!\n", "Q: Selective file sharing in a public coffee shop Two friends and I are sitting at a coffee shop. I would like them to browse the family pictures that I keep in ~/Family-Pictures. We don't have any cables or cords and for unimportant reasons, both friends need simultaneous access that one folder without my giving them my password. I also dont want anyone else in the shop getting at my mac or its contents. \nHow can I set up my mac to share with two other computers? \n\nA: You can share a folder by selecting it in the Finder, press CommandI (Or select Get Info), and check the box that says \"Shared Folder\". You will need to enable file sharing in System Preferences if you have not already done that. \nYour second and third questions have a single solution that could solve both problems. Unless the users have accounts on your machine, you are correct that you would be making the files available to anyone on the network. However, you could create a peer-to-peer network that only your friends have the password to join. Go to the WiFi menu and select \"Create Network.\" Assign your network a name and password, and give that information to your friends.\nBe sure to disable sharing when you are done, or else members of other, more public networks will be able to read your files.\n\nA: Based on your requirements that no one else be able to access the share, and that you don't want to hand out passwords, I'm going to suggest you go outside the OS and use third party software for this.\nSpecifically: Dropbox.\nIt happens to cover this use case in a nice way that gives you the security you want and the convenience you're after. It's also OS-independent which is nice if you're friends don't also have Macs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install Dropbox on your Mac. Create your account and get it up and running.\n\n*Under your new ~/Dropbox folder create a new folder. Call it something like Shared with Bob so you know anything you put in it will be shared with Bob.\n\n*Log in to the Dropbox web console at http://www.dropbox.com\n\n*Find the folder in the web console. Click once on it to bring up the folder options menu and select 'Invite to Folder' from the list of options.\n\n*Put in Bob's email address.\n\n\nOnce Bob joins Dropbox and the folder as a collaborator, anything either of you put in this folder will be sync'ed to the other person's Dropbox account and any computers they have linked to that account.\nOnce you're done sharing, reverse the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the folder in the Dropbox web console.\n\n*Click on it to bring up the options menu.\n\n*Select 'Shared Folder Options'\n\n*Click the 'Members' tab, find Bob in the list and say 'Kick Out'\n\n\nYou'll be given the option to let him keep the files on his disk or have the wiped. Up to you what you do.\nWith the slight inconvenience that the data you want to share has to live in your ~/Dropbox folder, this covers all your requests: it's secure (only you and whomever you invite to the folder can see the share), it doesn't require any passwords to be handed out, you don't have to enable any services on your Mac that might give other people on that public WiFi access to your machine.\n", "Q: Is it normal for my MacBook Pro (unibody) to creak in some spots? I bought a new MacBook Pro 15-inch model with highest specifications in this June. I also installed Lion and have updated it.\nMoreover, I would like to ask somebody who already has the same model, or any MacBook Pro, if it is normal to hear ticking sound when you push some spots on the bottom of the computer (beneath where the trackpad is).\n\nA: That's not \"ticking,\" that's a creak from the flex in the aluminum chassis. The MBP is not a brick of aluminum but a computer inside a hollow shell. While built solid, there is still play in the materials. \nThe sound you're hearing is likely the case pressing against the RAM, the battery connector, or the metal protector right beside the battery connector (or perhaps another component inside the machine).\nIf you are worried, take it into Apple. But they'll tell you the same thing. \n", "Q: How can I see which of my Login Items is slowing down my startup time? Recently — perhaps when I upgraded to Lion, perhaps some other time — I've noticed that OS X is not ready to go after startup as fast as it used to be. \nI have a fast SSD as my only internal drive, and I used to be able to do whatever I wanted within a few seconds of logging in. Now, as my Login Items and previously-open applications are reopened, there is at least one point at which I have to wait ten or so seconds while nothing happens.\nIt seems to me that Login Items are launched (somewhat) serially and not (entirely) in parallel. From that assumption I conclude that at least one of my Login Items is holding up the rest of the queue.\nSo my question: Is there a way for me to log the startup process and look at the log to see which app is hanging the queue?\n\nA: If you go to System Preferences » Users & Groups » Login Items, there is a list of items to automatically open.\nI have not been able, in Lion, to drag items to arbitrary positions in the list, as I remember being able to do in earlier versions of OS X. One can, however, drag items to the bottom of the list.\nSo it would appear that you could one by one drag everything that appears in your list before Alfred to the bottom of the list, thus launching Alfred first.\n\n\nA: You can see the start time of the individual processes in Terminal (ps aux). This may give you an indication about relative start time and any delays occuring.\n", "Q: OSX Lion 10.7.1 - Safari, Textedit or Stickies in separate Mission Control Desktops I have various Safari windows, TextEdit docs, and Stickies notes that relate to different things (e.g. work, home). I want to split these across two Mission Control desktops depending on what they are for. On Mission Control, I can't seem to drag these separate windows or even whole apps (collection of windows via the icon) into a desktop - the drag action works, the plus square appears, but the item then just springs back. Same for hovering it at edge of screen.\nUpdate: these apps had \"Assign to All\" set - changing to \"Assign to None\" via Dock did the trick :-)\n\nA: If the item you're trying to move springs back then it's most likely already on the space / desktop you're trying to move it to.\nYou can also try moving something to another desktop in ways other than Mission Control:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's say you already setup two spaces, and you want something from\nspace one onto space two; Just drag the window of whatever it is to\nthe edge of the screen and hold it there until it moves over to the\nother space.\n\n*Another way you can do this is to simply open whatever application or\nfile you want in that particular space.\n\n\nApps are automatically assigned to the Desktop / Space where they are launched for the very first time. You change this by Control clicking the apps icon in the\n   dock, and assign to None.\n", "Q: Is there a quicker way to clear cache on Safari mobile? Is there a quicker way to clear cache in Safari on iPhone besides going to Settings -> Safari -> Clear Cache?\n\nA: I have found that reloading a Web page in Mobile Safari twice clears the cache for the current Web page. Simply press reload, wait for it to finish loading, then reload again. \n\nA: Regretfully, no.\n(When I test my web code using Xcode's iOS Simulator, I find it easier to use the \"Reset Content and Settings...\" menu options rather than navigate into iOS's settings to clear the cache.)\n\nA: Here is a way you can follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the iPhone main menu, select \"Settings\" and then \"Safari\".\n\n*Scroll down to the bottom of the screen. There will be three options for you to choose from: \"Clear History\", \"Clear Cookies\", and \"Clear Cache\". You can simply clear all three by tapping each of them once and confirming the deletion\n\n*You can also clear your browsing history directly from the Safari browser. Start Safari and select \"Bookmarks\" at the bottom of the screen. Navigate to the history section  and select it.\n\n*Your internet history should then appear on the screen. You can then clear out the history by selecting \"clear\" at the bottom of the screen. It will then ask you to confirm \"clear history\".\n\n\nI  hope this helps\n", "Q: Help with MacBook Pro (unibody) keyboard damage I have some scratches on my A key. I don't actually know where it came from but it looks deep and melted. Could it have actually melted due to the screen heat? And if so, why only that letter? \nAlso, is there a way to easily clean the keyboard? Or do i have to disassemble my notebook and put it all back together again?\n\nA: \nCould it have \"melted\" due to the screen heat?\n\nNo. Impossible.\n\nAlso, is there a way to easily clean the keyboard?\n\nYou can pop out the keys if you like (see this YouTube clip). I would advise against pulling out the entire keyboard as you won't be able to clean it any quicker and may damage it (depending on your dexterity) in the process. It is also a lengthy process that requires removal of the logicboard (hit up iFixit for details). Technically, the keyboard is attached to the top panel of the notebook (unlike the pre-unibody MacBook Pros).\nAs for a cleaning solution, you can use any monitor cleaner or a high concentrate (99%) isopropyl alcohol (70% will if you can't find the 99%, but not preferred). Apply it using q-tips or a small micro-fiber rag.\n", "Q: How to clone an entire disk with Lion (+Rescue) & Bootcamp Partitions I have a faulty (hardware-wise) drive in my 2011 macbook pro and will probably get a replacement drive from the vendor, but I was wondering whether there is (by now) a way (tool) to clone the disk completely, including the (main) lion-, its rescue- and finally the windows7 bootcamp partition without having to completely re-install both systems?\n\nA: I know this is not a fully integrated solution, but you can use the tools available on Mac OS X and on the Mac OS install DVD/FlashDrive. You will have to restore both systems separately, but it will save you from having to reinstall everything in Windows and OS X.\n\nNote: If your drive is phisically damaged you might end up with corrupted data or being unable to clone your partitions.\n\nThere is a thread here explaining how you can save and restore your Bootcamp partition using only Disk utility and BootCamp: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=997823\nIt goes along the lines of (parts are just copied):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Disk Utility to backup your bootcamp partition to an external drive.\n\n*You can also use Disk Utility to backup your Mac OS partition if you didn't use Time Machine.\n\n*Install/Restore Mac OS to a new Hard Drive\n\n*Use Bootcamp to setup your drive for windows and to allocate the new space.\n\n*Use Disk Utility to restore your .dmg image to the new Boot Camp partition you just created. Be sure to run IMAGES --> SCAN IMAGE FOR RESTORE in Disk Utility before restoring. You may need to unmount the Boot Camp partition in Disk Utility before it begins to restore.\n\n*Use fdisk in Terminal to mark the Boot Camp partition active. First, enter the fdisk MBR edit mode by running the following:\n$sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0\nIgnore the error \"could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\". Then, determine which partition number to mark active by running the following (in bold):\nfdisk: 1> show\n\nYour windows partition should be #3 labeled \"Win95 FAT-32\". Now, mark the partition active:\nfdisk: 1> flag 3\nPartition 3 marked active.\nfdisk:*1> write\nDevice could not be accessed exclusively.\nA reboot will be needed for changes to take effect. OK?

How does it compare to the 4 and 3GS?\nAs I understand it the GPS in iPhone 4 is much better than that in the 3GS.\n\nA: The iPhone 4s, and the most recent iPhone 4 (Verizon) don't use a discrete GPS chip, as it's integrated into the baseband (Qualcomm MDM 6600). I believe the GPS chip in the iPhone 3GS used the Hammerhead II PMB 2540, or 2525 GPS chip. By integrating the GPS with the baseband it allows a smaller phone, less energy consumption, and cost less to produce. \niPhone 4s GPS [Qualcomm MDM 6600 Gobi]\nThe main improvements should be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Integration with Siri\n\n*Updated antenna switching (spatial diversity)\n\n*Improved TTFF and TTSF (fixes)\n\n*Longer battery life (more energy efficient)\n\n\nA: Just got the iPhone 4S - GPS reception is much better then iPhone 4.\nI checked number of satellites the phone can see - using MotionX GPS app, same location, same time. The two phones was next to each other for 15 minutes, and I also swapped their location few times.\n\nA: Since there is no official iPhone 4S delivered, I think there are no good records about this chip. All I can tell is the GPS accuracy improves with every iPhone model so far. \niPhone 3G sucks at GPS, iPhone 3GS was a bit better, iPad 1 was accurate, iPhone 4 is excellent as well as the iPad 2.\nSo as technology keeps improving, I guess the chips used in Apple's iPhones will too.\n", "Q: Using iCloud Mail account from Computers without Lion? If I understand correctly, MobileMe Mail will only work in the future under ICloud. For iCloud you need iOS 5 or Lion on an actual computer. \nI have 4 Apple computers currently in use, I use mail on whatever computer I am on. Only one has Snow Leopard which can upgrade to Lion. One has Leopard and 2 have Tiger. \nDoes anyone know if at least one computer has the most updated OS that the information will show up on other computers? \nI am not interested in an iPhone or iPad for email use since I require a full keyboard and tend to write lengthly emails.\n\nA: The short answer is you get to keep MobileMe as it is until June 30, 2012. \nSometime between when iCloud launches (tomorrow?) and next June, you can choose to learn about and use iCloud (assuming it meets all your current and future needs) or find another email provider. \nIt is clear that Apple has said you will lose access to you me.com account if you don't move to iCloud by then so unless that changes, you should plan some action. \nIf things go as planned, we will all get a public look at things this week. Perhaps read some official documentation in the next month you. The future is unclear today before iCloud has launched, but you have 9+ months to worry about this...\n\nA: MobileMe is going away with iCloud, it will last in its current form until some time next year. \nThe email from iCloud should be pretty standard like it is now, so therefore older mail clients should be able to use it - but you may have to upgrade one of your machines to enable iCloud. \nSo if you are asking if your mac.com/me.com email address will continue to work - yes, it should, as long as you convert to iCloud. You should then be able to set it up as an IMAP account on your older computers. This may not be a supported setup (so may be harder to get help if you need it)\nAs far as calendaring and all the other features of iCloud, you won't be able to use without Lion or iOS 5. \n", "Q: Vertically arranged multiple monitors: some apps won't let me drag them \"above\" the menu bar I'm working on a MacBook Pro, with my external monitor arranged on a higher shelf, and \"arranged\" within my display preferences as being \"above\" my MBP display.  I use the larger monitor when I'm coding, using the terminal, etc., and the MBP display for browsing, IM, and other things.\nMy problem is this: some apps won't let me drag them to beyond the menu bar on the MBP display.  If I arrange the displays in a horizontal configuration, or with the MBP display \"above\" the external monitor, I can drag the windows wherever I want.  An example of some apps that do this are Sublime Text 2 and XCode.\nIs there some trick to getting this to work that I'm missing?\nThanks!\n\nA: You are able to choose which monitor will have the menubar in the 'Displays' section of System Preferences.\nGo to System Preferences, click 'Displays', and choose the 'Orientation' tab. If you click and hold on the small white rectangle signifying the menu bar, you can move it between screens and move it to the top most display.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force Google Chrome to open in full screen? When I'm working just on my MacBook Pro,I like to keep as many apps as I can in Lion's full-screen mode.  One of these apps is Google Chrome.  However, Chrome doesn't remember that I want it to appear full screen after I quit it.  It always opens up in \"windowed\" mode.  Is there a way to force it to start in full screen?\nThanks.\n\nA: I was having the same problem BUT i think i found out how to make google chrome always open full screen. go to the wrench on the right hand side of the task bar when you have chrome open. go to settings, under the on start up section click \"continue where i left off.\" BAM google chrome should now open full screen... well it does for me anyways. hope this helps.\n\nA: Sorry, but everyone seems to want to mak a major deal out of this. The fix is VERY simple.\nWhen Chrome opens in half screen or whatever, put the cursor at the very top right edge of the window. A double headed, diagonal arrow will appear. Drag it all the way to the right. Do the same with the left side. Close Chrome and reopen it. It will open full screen every time from that point forward.\n\nA: The current version of Google Chrome for Mac (14.0.835.202) is not correctly supporting this behavior, even when the System Preference to \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\" is selected in the General Preferences pane (like the Mail app or Safari does). There is an open bug ticket on this issue with Google so at some point the \"remember full screen state after close\" should be resolved.

And my idea was that I could create a local account with very strict permissions.\nHaving found the option to change the home directory (system preferences > accounts > right-click > advanced) my thinking was that this would make the account unable to access anything but this directory (which may very well be wrong I now see).\nThus I changed the home directory to the directory I actually wanted to share (which is on this crucial external drive), which worked almost accordingly when logging in to the mac mini remotely (another shared folder was available as well).\nBut since the change claimed to require a reboot I rebooted the mini. Now I realized the account I had just created was no longer available under System Preferences > Accounts. It's still possible to access the mini using the accounts details remotely, but not when trying to log in on the actual mini itself.\nWhat I find puzzling is that the account neither exists under:\n$ /Users/\n\nnor:\n$ /path_to_external_drive/dir_i_chose_as_home/\n\nHowever, when entering the Server Admin and assigning File Sharing permissions, I can see the new account in the users list when clicking add (the + sign) to assign permissions.\nNow I could just leave this account there but this feels highly irresponsible.\nI do understand it was very ignorant of me, changing the home directory without understanding it's implications. You are welcome to comment on whether or not this whole idea actually was unfeasible and unsafe but I would highly, highly appreciate if you could help me safely get rid of this newly created account (which essentially is my question).\nHow do I remove an account I can no longer see via System Preferences > Accounts (because I have changed its home directory)?\nThank you in advance\n\nA: Open up terminal and try:\n$ dscl . -list /groups GroupMembership\n\nYou should get a list of users along with which group they belong to. You should look for user/admin accounts including the one you recently made; This command will show you all users with the recently created one most likely near the bottom:\n$ dscl . list /users\n\nTo get information about a user:\n$ dscl . read /users/foo\n\nWhich will verbosely spit out all of the basic information, yielding this information near the bottom:\nNFSHomeDirectory: /Users/foo\n\nif you want to delete a user:\n$ sudo dscl . delete /users/foo\n\nasta la bye-bye! from there you can decide  whether or not to delete ex-users directory.\n", "Q: Is my Mac spying on me? Feel free to call me crazy or paranoid, but sometimes I feel like the camera LED turns on briefly (for approximately 0.1 seconds). Maybe it's just odd reflections, or me confusing the LED for the camera itself with my peripheral vision, but it piqued my curiosity; how would I find out if some utility is turning on and off the camera very quickly to snap a picture? Is it even possible to do it that quickly? How would I diagnose this? Does something like this actually exist? \nEdit: Note, yes, I do know of the existence of trojans and so on. The point of my question is: as a sysadmin-level user (advanced), how can I perform this diagnostic, hard core? Also, the question about the timing is: when the camera is turned on by any utility, is it possible to turn it on, snap a picture, and turn it off in such a small amount of time? Does the driver allow you such a quick round trip?\n\nA: To answer your question, yes it is possible to turn the camera on momentarily and take snaps without the user knowing - apps like Hidden take advantage of this to protect your Mac from theft.\n\nA: Such things do exist. They are known as Trojans. However, Trojans are rare on Mac OS X, and unless you are an avid downloader of torrents or illegal material, chances are you don't have any. If you're really paranoid, Norton can check for viruses, including Trojans and Bots. As well, if you legitimately believe that your Mac is taking pictures, cover up the camera with a post-it note or something similar when it's not in use.\n\nA: If you've ever used Photo Booth, or any other app using your built-in camera as a source, you may know that there's no way anything less than 1 second is fast enough. There is a very obvious warm-up time in order for the camera to actually warm up and provide an image. Although the problem with timing Photo Booth is that it has to open the app, draw the window, then fire up the camera somewhere in there.\nAs a matter of testing, I opened up Quicktime Player (Quicktime X) and let it settle down, then I hit File -> New Movie Recording. Luckily for me, the image didn't fire up right away because the built-in camera for my laptop was chosen, but I have the lid closed using an external screen also with a built-in camera.\nSo I changed the input source to the external camera, and pressed start on my stopwatch as soon as the green LED lit up (which was pretty much immediately). The video started displaying at about 1.5 seconds in. That's still certainly within \"blink-and-you'll-miss-it\" territory, but only barely.\nMy answer is that I'm suggesting stray light may be reflecting off of area the LED resides in, invoking an \"illuminated\" feeling, but that nothing may be happening in reality.\nHowever, I don't suggest that you do nothing. Commercial vendors such as Sophos offer Antivirus products of OS X, Lion-compatible and free too in Sophos' case, and I've also used ClamXAV as a one-off scan-on-demand utility when I've had similar feelings (or when I've wanted to check a file for a windows-using friend, etc.).\nNote also that OS X does have built-in spyware protection named, \"XProtect\", that was born out of the \"MacDefender\" trojan scare. TUAW has many great articles on the subject under the security tag.\n\nA: Yes, it certainly is possible. That light is just a UI convenience, so that we users can feel that we know when the camera is on. \nNote: My cam LED never comes on in the fashion you describe. \nYou can disable the camera. Use one of the NSA hardening guides found on this page. Seriously, how often do you use your camera? Just unload the drivers and see where the new error messages show up. Virus scanning is a good idea, so is a clean re-install, but perhaps better to disable the camera and see what else happens. \n\nA: I´ve already posted this answer in this similar question but assume that it is also relevant here:\nToday I stumbled across a proper publication regarding this topic: Researches from the Johns Hopkins University recently published the paper \"iSeeYou: Disabling the MacBook Webcam Indicator LED\", showing that they were able to deactivate the iSight status LED on older MacBooks even without root access by replacing its firmware.\nIt appears they were able to do so by bypassing the standby signals sent by the USB interface; thus while the LED gets the order to \"standby\", the camera stays on.\n\nA: Yes, my Mac does exactly this thing. Just now, it's looking at me with its green eye while the camera is not supposed to be on. It's not just for 0,1 second, it's more than suspicious. However LittleSnitch shows no network activity.\nBoth on Lion and Mountain Lion. I suppose this could be remains of some Internet Security software i have tried and uninstalled months ago. \nI have killed all the 15 running apps except for Safari and the light is gone. Starting VLC, the LED has blinked for a while so this is might be the prime suspect of aforementioned case.\n\nA: I agree with thread owner, may be we are spying by Apple, that is not virus from \"3rd\".\nKasperky has been noticed this, but I really don't beleive. However, I have temporary solution is use any firewall from 3rd like as: HandOff, LitleSnitch, ... to monitor all data transfer through network deny unknow packages.\nJust remember when you in network: don't beleive anything/anyone.\n", "Q: How to check whether the Mac OS X installation DVD I have is for my MacBook Pro? I just tried to reinstall OS X on my 13\" MacBook Pro with the installation DVD that I have (OS is Snow Leopard, I bought around 2010). I followed all the reinstallation steps correctly, but what I got is a \"Mac OS X cannot be installed on this computer\" error. I read lots of forums post about the solutions and tried everything, but nothing works. I tried zeroing the partition several times with GUI partition scheme, did PRAM/NVRAM reset. Nothing works.\nSo there's only one scenario I need to check which is whether the Mac OS X installation DVD that I have is for my MacBook Pro. Can anyone please kindly point out to me how I can check whether the disc is the correct one for my MacBook Pro?\n\nA: It says so right on the disk.\n\nPlease don't pirate OS X.\n", "Q: Not able to open DVD tray in brand new MacBook Pro I just bought a brand new 13\" MacBook Pro, i5 2.3 GHz, running Mac OS X 10.6.7.\nI'm not able to open the DVD tray of my Mac. I have tried pressing down the ⏏ key in the top right corner several times, as well as fn+⏏, but no success.\nIs there some defect with this MacBook Pro or is there some other way to open the DVD tray?\n\nA: The SuperDrive is slot-loading. You don't open it, but rather slide the CD/DVD into the slog. When you press the eject key, the drive will eject the disc.\n\nA: Is there a DVD in the drive in the drive you want to eject?\nMacBooks use slot drives meaning there is no tray at all, you just push the CD/DVD (gently) into the slot til the drive 'grabs' it and pulls it in (HT1360).\nIn case you need to eject a disc which doesn't react to the usual means, the following may help (taking more or less verbatim from Apple):\nEjecting a CD or DVD when all else fails\n\n\n*\n\n*First, quit all applications that are using files on the disc. Then try one of the following alternate methods\n\n*Open Disk Utility (in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder), select the disc, and choose File > Eject.\n\n*Choose Apple menu > Restart and hold down the mouse or trackpad button until the disc ejects.\n\n*Reboot the computer and keep the mouse/trackpad pressed\n\n\nA: As a side note, since you're coming from the world of CD trays to the slot loading drives:\nDo Not put oddly shaped CDs in the drive. These are much less common now than they used to be, but the business-card shaped CDs, or half-sized CDs etc.? They don't belong in your drive. It's entirely possible that the mechanism that ejects CDs from your drive won't be able to reach them. Which means a tech having to open up your machine and getting the CD out that way.\n", "Q: Time Machine fails backup to a time capsule's attached hard disk I've been backing up my Lion OSX system using Time Machine to an second, external drive connected to a time capsule. It has worked but stopped working.\nThe menu says \"Faied\" and the time machine prefs says:\n\"The backup disk image “/Volumes/WD1-1/monster.sparsebundle” could not be created (error 22)\"\n\nAs far as I can tell the external hard disk is just fine.  One really weird thing is that the external drive is called \"WD1\". However the Volume in the error message is specified as /Volumes/WD1-1. In fact in shall I see this:\nmonster:~ pitosalas$ mount\n/dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk1s2 on /Volumes/MonsterHD (hfs, local, journaled)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\nafp_0TSQUm1ubQ4400mmYF0Pyetl-1.2d000003 on /Volumes/WD1 (afpfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by pitosalas)\nafp_0TSQUm1ubQ4400mmYF0Pyetl-1.2d00005c on /Volumes/WD1-1 (afpfs, nobrowse)\n\nand \nmonster:~ pitosalas$ ls /Volumes/\nBootHD      MonsterHD   WD1     WD1-1\n\n(notice that MonsterHD and BootHD are both internal drives of the OSX box called monster)\nWhat is that second Volume WD1-1? It has different characteristics in $ mount listing none of which are meaningful to me. Could that be related to the problem?\n\nA: Time Machine tries to track a UID for the volume and not a name, but it could be confused.\nHave you tried setting the backup destination to none and rebooting with no drives connected and no network connection.\nAt that point /Volumes should be clean and you would be safe to delete any non-local drives at that point. My guess is it's perhaps a second route to the network - do you have a wired connection and WiFi to the AirPort/Time Capsule?\ndiskutil list will also get you more information about drives than mount in case you want to post more details and can't get Time Machine happy with these steps.\n\nA: Thanks for the tips.

Is that still true of the 4S when used in CDMA?\nAs @Jannemans points out this wasn't possible in any CDMA phone until one point. But the question is valid now that the CDMA standard allows it.\n\nA: The limitation of simultaneous voice and data is not one of the iPhone but one related to the CDMA2000 standard.\nHowever, the official CDMA Development group announced the CMDA X standard on Aug 17 2009. This standard allows for simultaneous voice and data:\nQuoting the press release\nA complementary device enhancement known as simultaneous 1X Voice and EV-DO Data (SVDO) will also become available during the same timeframe and will enable CDMA2000 devices to access EV-DO packet data services while in an active 1X circuit-switch voice call. For example, users will be able to send emails or access the Web while on voice calls; phones with GPS can update maps or download real-time traffic information while on voice calls, etc. This device enhancement, which enables these concurrent voice and data services, is independent of the air link standard and infrastructure.\nWhen Verizon or any other CDMA carrier will implement this, is an entirely different question...\n\nA: According to Apple, \"CDMA networks do not support simultaneous voice and data over any connection.\"\nI tried this with a Sprint phone, it didn't work. It gives an error message when you try to surf the web when on a call. However WiFi data still works.\n", "Q: Is there a way to control USB audio device settings from the iPad? It's possible to use the iPad as a USB host and connect up class-compliant USB audio interfaces through the Camera Connection Kit.\nBut is there a way to adjust their settings in iOS?  There is in OS X through the Audio/MIDI Setup:\n\nThe device's output level, for instance, is affected by the regular iPad volume controls, but the playthrough feature and input gain don't seem to have any controls, at least not in Garageband.   Is there a hidden setting somewhere or an app that can control such things?\n\nA: iOS allows the currently frontmost app to control the audio session and to configure the audio input for its use.  So you would have to look in each app to see if it has any settings for audio while it is running.  \nThere is an API for an app to request an input sample rate.  However there currently appears to be no public API for an app to set the hardware audio input gain.\n", "Q: How to turn on Intel VT in MacBook Pro 2011 (MC721LL/A)? I used to turn on virtualization on my PC by turning it on from BIOS. But how I do it on MacBook Pro, as I am using WinXP on VMware Fusion 4.0, but its very slow, and both Windows XP and Mac OS starts lagging. \nIs there any way I can turn on virtualization for Mac so that the lagging stops? It's really driving me crazy.\n[Note: it's a 2.0 GHz Intel Core i7 quad-core processor (\"Sandy Bridge\") with 6 MB shared L3 cache for excellent multitasking.]\n\nA: It should be turned on automatically. If you go into the settings for the Windows XP virtual image, then click advanced, you'll see a field for Preferred virtualization engine. It should be set to \"Automatic\" by default, but if you want to force Intel VT, you can select one of those options.\nIf you're lagging, something else might be to blame.

When you send a message using the Messages app, iOS seems to magically figure out that the recipient is on iOS 5 and automatically switches over to iMessage (blue messages instead of green SMSs).\n\nDoes anybody know (or fancy a guess at) how iOS 5’s iMessage knows the recipient is an iOS 5 device? I’m stumped.\n\n(I asked this question on Twitter a few months ago and wanted an easier way to refer to the answer!)\n\nA: \nSlight revision It seems that the below has changed slightly, and Apple now checks which numbers/emails have been activated per device for sending messages. Therefore, my mobile number on my iPhone can be registered on my iCloud account, and allow me to receive message sent to my mobile number to be received on my iPad. Therefore you can have the conversation appear on multiple devices at once, and switch between them. iMessage will keep these conversations in sync. I disable this by specifying which accounts to be linked to which device when configuring iMessage.\n\nTo expand on alexmuller's answer it uses the Device ID to determine if another device is running iOS 5. This is done during registration, or when iMessage is configured under phone settings. Effectively the Device ID and Apple ID's/Mobile numbers are stored on the Apple Servers.\nIt checks the Apple servers to determine if a number or email address is registered as an Apple ID and using iOS 5. It will then send the message via the Apple Servers first. It also uses text fallback, so if the other user is not using an iOS device, or iMessage is unavailable or down, or your data connection is down, it will send the message as a text. Text fallback can however be disabled. This does not affect normal texting.\nOn the phone itself iMessages are identified via a blue background, and can show Delivered/Read for each message. SMS to the same person is still shown in a green background.\nIt also uses the Device ID to determine which device to reply to. I have my email address and phone number configured on my iPhone and on my iPad only my email address.\nIn Example \n\n\n*\n\n*I send a message to my wife's iPad using her email address from my iPhone, she receives it on the iPad, and the reply is sent back to my iPhone. \n\n*I send a message via my iPad to her email address, the reply is sent back to my iPad, and not my iPhone. \n\n*She sends a message to my iPhone using my mobile number from the iPad, it comes to my iPhone and bypasses the iPad completely and the reply goes back to her iPad.\n\n\nIt's intelligent enough to know where the message came from and where to reply to.\n\nA: I heard that they use wizards.\nThat and they store your number on server at point of activation, however it's very quick so I'm not 100% on that one. Very quick at the moment might just be low load on the system though.\n\nA: The answer I got from @chrismear on Twitter was as follows:\n\nYour mobile number must be sent to Apple's server and stored against your device ID for APN. I guess it happens at activation. \"How do they identify FaceTime devices by phone number?\" is the same question. Answer at 4.(c) in bold (archived url).\n\nTweet one, tweet two.\n\nA: I think it simply looks up the number you are sending a message to. If it's a number/email address in Apple's iMessage database, then it uses iMessage servers to pass the message. \nOther cool tricks to know about iMessage:\nIf you have an iPad, and you are using an email address with iMessage on the iPad, go to your iPhone and navigate to:\nSettings -> Messages -> Receive At\nHere you can add other \"addresses\" that your phone's iMessage will respond to. If you put your email address in here, then anytime someone sends an iMessage to your email address it will appear on both your iPad and your iPhone. If you have iMessage open on one of your devices and you are actively engaged in a conversation, the other device will stop ringing when a new message comes in. Don't you just love Apple's attention to detail?\nIn this same screen, there is an option called Caller ID. You can set what your device will use as a return address when you message someone. I went into this menu and put my email address in as my caller ID. As a result.. when someone replies to one of my message, it will always send to my email address instead of my phone number. This way I can read it on both my devices.\n", "Q: Will I have to create separate Apple IDs for two iOS devices to message each other? I have one Apple ID that I use for both my iPhone and my wife's iPhone. In iOS5, if we want to message to each other using iMessage, will one of us need to create a separate AppleID? And if so, will that affect apps that we've downloaded to the device using the other Apple ID?\n\nA: You don't have to create separate Apple ID's for the iPhone because iMessage also works by using the phone number. \nHowever if you have two wi-fi only iPad's or iPod touch's then you will just have to use separate e-mail address. \n\n", "Q: Put the display to sleep without putting the whole computer to sleep? I like to use vnc on my ipad on my bed. I want the mac to go to a black screen so I can fall asleep while using the ipad, and not have to get up to shut down the mac afterwards. Is there anyway to turn off the imac screen without sleeping? \nI'm open to anything that minimizes the light - so if the backlight is off, that would meet the needs even if the screen is still drawing content.\nFrom a semantics standpoint, let's assume the following:\nWhen the system sleeps, the display sleeps or a screensaver engages are all distinct states. The display is asleep when the backlight is off and the GPU doesn't bother drawing any signal to that display but continues to run. This is different than system sleep where everything except the RAM and network interfaces1 are shut off.\n1: Network interfaces that support wake on lan (WOL) only do so when power not from a battery is available.\n\nA: You can turn off your iMac (and your macbook) screen without sleeping via the following keyboard shortcut:\n ⌃  +  ⇧  +  ⏏ \n(Control +SHIFT + EJECT)\nMachines like the Air and newer MacBook Pro with no optical drives have the power button in the same place as the eject key and it works similarly for display sleeping shortcuts.\n\nA: In Terminal.app:\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html\nThis also works for the lock and sleep functions:\npmset sleepnow\npmset lock\n\n\nA: On computers without an eject button (iMac with non-Apple keyboard; 2011 MacBook Air; etc.), it becomes difficult to put the display to sleep without using a hot corner.

Its quick, easy, and painless. All I have to do, is mouse over to my top right corner, and my screen goes instantly blank. \nIt puts the screen without putting the computer to sleep. Hope my tip helps\nPS:. In Mac OS X Lion you can access hot corners in the Preferences pane under Mission control.\n\nA: Your first stop should be the energy saver preference pane. Dial down the Display sleep slider as short as you can stand it.\n\nIf you don't want to wait for this time out, you could also set a hot corner and black screensaver so you could use VNC to set the mouse pointer to the corner to engage a black screensaver so the screen is as dim as possible until the sleep timer shuts off the LCD lighting as well as the data to the iMac screen.\n\nA: You can use this great open source tool: \nhttps://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor\nTested on iMac (20-inch, Early 2009) with OSX El Capitan 10.11.4 and Dell U2515H external monitor via DP\n\nA: you just dim the screen all the way down.

Restarting iTunes makes no difference, and it happens both on iTunes 10.4 and 10.5.\nHow can I get iTunes to check with Apple for an update? Thanks.\n\nA: I am on Lion but had a similar problem. Based on info here: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_Deploying_iTunes/Introduction/Introduction.html , which says that 'the file selector dialog only appears only if automatic detection of iOS updates is turned off', I tried removing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist.  \nThis fixed things for me.  Quit iTunes before you do this, and move the plist file somewhere so that you can restore it if necessary. (It may be possible to change this preference setting without messing with the plist; however, I couldn't immediately spot where to do it in the UI).\n\nA: You don't want to delete the whole plist, because you'll lose all your preferences. Just change the single flag by running the following in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunes disableCheckForUpdates -bool NO\n\n\nA: I've had the same problem updating my iPhone OS with iTunes on Windows 7.

I know I can get a cord that has a cigarette lighter adapter on one end and a 3.5mm audio jack on the other but I'd prefer to do it completely wireless if possible.\nHas anyone had any success doing this?  If so what device(s) did you use?\n\nA: You need a Bluetooth stereo if you want NO wires or adapters, but it constantly cuts out (check other forums). You'd be better off with a direct connection, or an adapter/cable to send it over tr FM waves\n\nA: The way to do it is via Bluetooth A2DP. Basicly it's the most standard way to send stereo audio via Bluetooth.\nThe best case would be if you own Car stereo that has native support for A2DP and AVRCP (control your iPhone play/pause/next from your stereo). If you don't own such equipment, you could use separate A2DP receiver like Tunelink Auto and connect it in your AUX in port (or receive it on FM).\nps.

Now it gives me error when I try to create the app with the same name.\n\n\nA: You have to contact iTunes Connect, they'll have it already in their system that your app took the name first, but as you've tried to recreate it with the same name the system is assuming the other is valid (but with errors) and bouncing you. There's a support email address for them, they'll either be able to pull the old one and let you take the spot, or advise you on what you need to do.\n\nA: After calling Apple, their rep said, this is a kind of scenario where you have lost the name.

However, there is an ignore-devices configuration value to tell the helper to stop launching iTunes when a device is attached.\nSet this option like so (seems to take effect immediately):\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunesHelper ignore-devices 1\n\nThis allows you to keep auto sync enabled in iTunes (so it will sync when you decide to launch it manually), while also keeping iTunes from still popping up when your device has a software update available.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the option mentioned in the other answers is no longer present on iTunes. Instead, the OSX solution is now similar to the Windows one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Select Users & Groups\n\n*Select your user profile if not selected already\n\n*Go into the Login items tab\n\n*Select and remove iTunes Helper from the list\n\n*Log out and back in, or restart OSX\n\n\nA: The simplest way is to un-tick the Automatically sync this... box* on the Summary Screen for the device in iTunes when the device is connected:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This is per device.\n\n\nAlternatively you can just remove the iTunesHelper service under your Login Items which will disable it irrelevant of the tick box state.\n\nA: From the iTunes menu at the top go to iTunes>Preferences>Devices>Prevent iPods, iPhones and iPads from syncing automatically.

Recently, I've migrated from a strict Windows to a OSX environment.  I'm using the Magic Mouse as my pointing device and so far I've been satisfied.\nThe only problem that I am having is that I can not get my mouse to consistently recognize my two-finger swipes to swap between my full screen apps.  It does work but only occasionally.  Specifically, I have to swipe about 30 times before the screen will actually switch to the other application.  Also, I know that the mouse is partially picking up my gesture because the window will begin to barely transition, but I usually can't get the screen to shift any more than a couple inches on my 27\" display. \nThis is unusable.\nAre there any gesture sensitivity settings that I may be able to tweak, buried in some form of an initialization of configuration file?  Or, am I stuck and I'll have to simply avoid using this gesture?  I think this functionality would be very useful.  For now, however, it's not an option.\n\nA: Try this little utility: http://www.magicprefs.com/\nIt allows you to override mouse gestures, map them to your own actions, etc.\nIt also has a graphical view to show you what you're doing, which can be very useful in figuring out what you're doing wrong.\n\nA: I'd also suggests BetterTouchTool, a fork of Multiclutch, which allows you to remap a tons of multi-touch gestures.\nMoreover the program allows for windows snapping (a là Windows 7), and keyboard shortcuts.\nIt's definitely worth a try.\n", "Q: After upgrading to Lion interface alignment seems to break, any ideas? After upgrading after Lion (circa 3 months ago) more and more interfaces seems to just break. It's easiest if see it yourselves!\n\nAnyone know how to fix this issue?\n\nA: First, do a Safe Boot. This, among other things, clears the Mac OS X font caches. There are also several third-party GUI tools for clearing the font caches, and there is a command-line command for doing this in the Terminal; can somebody else please provide the details?\nSecond, this may be a long shot, but have you used TinkerTool or a similar utility to change system font default point sizes? If so, try setting everything back to its default.\nTinkerTool has many other wonderful capabilities, but its font point size settings are not practical simply because Mac OS X has never reacted well to changes in the font point size in the user interface.\nHave a look at the screen shot below. It shows the TinkerTool interface set to the proper default system settings for all fonts. You can use this to confirm that everything is set to the correct default.\n\n\nA: I have seen this many times before. It's a safe bug, i.e. it won't affect your data, only the look of fonts on screen. The problem in this case is the font Helvetica (and any of it's variations). Apple uses a TrueType version of the font, and you probably somehow replaced it with a PostScript or OpenType version.\nEach font has a baseline where all characters' \"bottoms\" align to and letters with descenders like 'g, j and y' will let their lower parts hang from. Even if the font is named the same, the baseline set by the creator of the font can be different from TrueType to OpenType and so on... Therefore this bugs happens.\nSimply find out why your Helvetica has been modified and change it back, if possible. Eeither you or someone replaced the font in the /System/Library/Fonts/ folder, or you are using a font manager (Suitcase, FontExplorer Pro, etc.) that can change fonts in the system.\nWhatever you do, you need Helvetica (and quite a few variations of it, as well as others) always be present in your system, they need to be available before any font manager is loaded. Otherwise your system will become unstable. The OS doesn't care what kind it is, as long as it is present.\nYou can have a look at this excellent document by Extensis, downloadable here:\nhttp://www.extensis.com/en/downloads/document_download.jsp?docId=5600039\nIt covers the fonts that are mandatory, which ones can be removed, and lots lots more.\n", "Q: Is a Macbook pro not able to use dual screen on the integrated graphics card?

The screen is a VGA monitor running at 1400 x 900 yet it won't display so do I always have to switch to my AMD GPU to run dual screens? I'm running gfxCardStatus to switch between them and i'm just trying to save power. \n\nA: No, it does not. You need the discrete GPU to run an external display.\nFunny though, because the integrated GPU's of the MacBook Air can power up to a 27\" thunderbolt display. But that's how Apple rolls.\n\nA: No, it appears that using an external display requires using the discrete graphics card.\nThe reason for this is probably how the electrical connections are hooked up. Usually with a switchable-graphics setup like this, the internal display is connected to the integrated GPU and the external display is hooked up to the discrete GPU. In discrete graphics mode, the integrated GPU acts as little more than a framebuffer, routing the discrete GPU's signals to the internal screen. In integrated graphics mode, however, the discrete GPU is off, so nothing can talk to the external display.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of this icon in my menu bar?

I am getting an iMac 27 inch, and it will have a 1 TB internal hard drive, and I know we can set up the Mac so that this hard drive is mirrored on an external 1 TB hard drive using the built in tools of Mac OS X (Applications -> Utilities -> Disk Utility).\nBut the OS's system files, the swap file, etc, are all on the internal drive as well.

If so, won't that slow the system down a lot, since the external drive is usually slower than the internal drive.\nAlso, even if the OS's files are not mirrored but just the user's own files, will copying or file saving be slower, since instead of copying to the faster internal drive, the OS will report done only after the external drive is done as well?\n\nA: A mirrored RAID would operate only as fast as the slowest drive in the setup.  In this case, unless you are using thunderbolt I imagine the performance would be awful.  Another reason not to do a mirror with an external drive (if Disk Utility would even let you) is it'd be too easy have the mirror fail for a number of reasons.\nI would use Time Machine to the external drive rather than mirroring.  Remember that RAID is NOT backup!  If you mess something up then you will lose data, a mirrored RAID is not going to save you at all.  Only Time Machine or a similar backup strategy will help prevent data loss.\n", "Q: Are there any non-Apple multi-touch trackpads on the market? I love the Apple trackpad with its multi-touch gestures. I want to buy a MacBook Pro primarily because of this. I am a student though and it seems to be very expensive for me. Hence I was wondering if any other company except for Apple provides a trackpad, or is it only available on Apple devices?\nAlso if this is the case then is there a software that can be used to mimic the Apple trackpad on an ordinary laptop? I am using Synaptic but is not the same. I know that software support and hardware support (which Apple provides) provides different user experience with the latter being more adroit, but what is the best I can get?\n\ni want a hardware and software package. Are there any drivers in windows that will understand the trackpad movements?\n\nA: Yes. Bamboo tablets made by Wacom are an option: they allow multi-touch and stylus input on a pretty large surface, but are more expensive than a magic trackpad: the cheapest I believe costs $75 USD. Wacom is a company that builds touch devices for graphic designers and consumers. Perhaps you want to give a look to their website:\nhttp://www.wacom.com/en/Products/Bamboo/BambooTablets.aspx\nIn case though, you want to use the Magic Trackpad, Windows drivers for Apple devices are downloadable in the form of Bootcamp Updates from the Apple Support page. Alhtough the trackpad is supposed to be Mac-only, after a bit of googleing I found a couple tutorials explaining how to use it with Windows. \nHere is a blogpost I found, and a webpage with instructions:\nhttp://www.mannis-world.de/blog/?p=15\nhttp://www.labnol.org/software/apple-magic-trackpad-with-windows/14158/\nAbout using multitouch with any other laptop: I don't think this is possible, for it requires hardware features not present on most laptops. \nHope it helps!\n", "Q: How can I add an audio menu in the Finder? What is the easiest way to add menu item to finder that switched audio from internal to external(headphone). I have to switch back and forth often and going into control panel every time is a pain in Snow leopard. Is there a way to do this with Applescript?\n\nA: You can ⌥-click the volume menu in the menu bar to quickly select which audio output device to use.\n\nA: There are two ways that I know of.\nHold option and click on the volume icon in the finder to get a list of input/output options.\nThe other option is to download an app called SoundSource.\n\n", "Q: How can I mark a thread as read in Lion Mail? In Mail 5.0, when I view a message, it's marked as read. No surprises there.\nWhen I get a few messages in the same thread, and I view the thread, the latest message is marked as read, but I can't figure out how to mark the earlier messages as read. \nI've tried scrolling down to make sure Mail knows I've seen all the messages in the thread. I've also tried clicking the drop-down button to reveal all of the messages in the thread (in the middle \"preview\" column, or whatever it's called) and highlighting the message that's still marked as unread.\nThe only thing that seems to work is to right-click and select Mark > As Read. \nIs that just a bug or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: In case you didn't know, when viewing the different messages in the right reading pane, if you select any of the individual messages they will be marked as read.  This gives you the ability to mark some as read and leaving others marked as unread.\n\nA: If you Right-Click (or Control-Click) the thread itself in the list of emails in that box, there is a contextual menu item that says Mark > as Read.\nThis isn't a bug as much as it is a design decision. When you select the email in question, invariably you have more emails in that thread than you have screen real-estate. So it only marks those as read which you can see at the top of the screen or in full. Everything else is not read because you haven't seen them yet.\nI hope that helps and explains why they chose to do what they did.\n\nA: Try using Command + A ( select all ), then right clicking > Mark > as Read/Un-Read.\n\nYou could also setup a \"Smart Mailbox\" to filter all unread messages, then use process above.\n\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Problem updating iPod Touch to iOS 5 Using iTunes to upgrade the OS on a 4th generation iPod Touch, the update downloads but when it attempts to install it the process fails with the following message:\n\nThe iPod \"iPod Touch (4G)\" could not be restored.

I want to migrate this account to iCloud rather than signing up for a new iCloud account with a different email address.  Is this possible?  If so, how?\nWhen I try to login at www.iCloud.com with my old Mobile Me ID I get the error below:  \n\nIf I click 'Get Started' I'm redirected to www.me.com to login to my old account where I get the message below:\n \nWhen I click on 'Learn More' I get directed to a support page which just says I can migrate from Mobile Me by visiting www.me.com/move but this just gives me the same result as above.\nHas anyone managed to move an expired Mobile Me account to iCloud?  If so, how did you do it?\n\nA: This article from Apple Support answers some commonly-asked questions related to the Mobile Me to iCloud transition. This article from Apple Support explains how to move to iCloud. From this article we read the following:\n\nInactive and expired MobileMe accounts do not need to move to iCloud.\n  Simply use your inactive or expired account to sign up for an iCloud\n  account and follow the onscreen instructions\n\nThis article lists some additional troubleshooting issues with accounts and iCloud. It is important to note that the number one troubleshooting issue mentioned is iCloud outages. As it has been mentioned on this thread, iCloud is being hit pretty hard today on its official launch day. From the article: \n\nCheck System Status to make sure there are no outages or scheduled\n  maintenances currently affecting your iCloud account. System Status is\n  displayed at the iCloud Support web site.\n\nThe \"Lean More\" link on the original question (above) is the same link as the first one I include on this answer. If some of these links are not working in your area, it may be a matter of waiting for the pages to propagate across Apple's worldwide servers (and their backbone providers). The links work within the US. It also worth mentioning that more articles are literally being made available by the hour. In other words, There is a chance the some of these links will not work immediately for you, but they eventually should. Hope this helps. \n\nA: I could not migrate via the web site either, but I managed to do it once I got 10.7.2 installed on my Mac. I then used my expired MobileMe account as the Apple ID to log into iCloud with (from within the Mac dialog that showed up on first boot after the update). It was then reactivated and migrated to iCloud automatically. I expect it would work the same way from iOS 5.\n\nA: It's been a nightmare for me too... but suddenly while reading an article. Just follow these steps:\n1. Go to System Preferences\n2. Launch MobileMe preferences pane\n3. Sign out of your MobileMe account\n4. Leave the pane\n5. Launch iCloud pane..\nNow you can sign in with your 'expired' MobileMe account and use your cool @me.com email for free via iCloud!\n\nA: Although I was unable to revive an old, very old, almost forgotten, @me.com on my MacBook, I was able to do it on my iPhone. Even though it already had a different iCloud address etc. set up. After I turned mail on, it asked me if I wanted to create a new @iCloud email address too.\nSettings>Mail, Contacts, Calendars>Add Account...>iCloud\n", "Q: Is using a Mac mini as an iPhoto server for 2 client laptops a good idea? We have 200+ gigs of pictures and home videos on both me and my wife's laptops. This is getting unmanageable as well as taking up too much hard drive space on both of our laptops.\nI am thinking about getting a Mac mini that will acts as an iPhoto server, and setting up an iPhoto share so that our laptops can still browse the pictures as well as our Apple TV always having access to that stream of photos. That way our Apple TV is not dependent on our laptops being powered on.\nIs this a good idea? Anyone have a better suggestion?\n\nA: You can happily place the library and have it share out.  You will need to have iPhoto running at all times in order to have the library visible to other users tho.\nWhen you connect to the library from another Mac, you will not be able to use the same Events/Albums views that you have locally.  Some of it is available, but mainly it just throws a huge list of all your stuff that is not organised in the same way as you would expect if it was local.  Also, it's SLOW, in that it seems to almost cache the contents each time you connect which can take a while, and subsequent navigation is not quick either.\nAnother way to do this, is to share out the folder that the iPhoto data resides in, rather than opening iPhoto and sharing your library via the app.  This has the advantage that iPhoto does not need to be running on the Mini, although the disadvantage is your Apple TV won't connect.  This will however open the library in the same way as if it were local (in essence it is local, just on a network drive).  You can test this out by holding OPTION down as you start iPhoto, it will let you connect to a different library.\nAll in all, it's not a great solution either way.  I long for a sensible way of sharing in iPhoto and iTunes that does not require the apps to be running at the time (just a background sharing daemon would be great), that allows you to navigate and modify as if they were local, but it does't really exist for either app, and any solution is substandard to your local install workflows.\n\nA: I've also been wondering about this for some time. I think Apple is missing the boat on this. It would be a great way to sell more Mac mini Servers if Mac OS X Server had a iPhoto Server... and an iTunes Server. Simply running iPhoto and iTunes on a designated home computer is the best idea that I can think of but it requires that you 'move' items off of your laptop and on to the server on a regular basis.\nThe idea is that once in a while, you copy a bunch of items from your personal use laptop to the 'server' by going to the server and looking at your laptop's shared library and dragging items across. Once you've confirmed that the copy was successful, you may go back to the laptop and delete them. This keeps the library on your laptop lean and mean while still giving you access to the 'archive' from both your laptop and your Apple TV.\nUltimately, I'd love to see this type of thing built in to both iPhoto and iTunes so that you could 'archive' items to your 'Server' as a PUSH instead of physically going to your server and PULLING them across.\n\nA: I am personally considering this same idea, I think that the Wi-Fi sharing features of the Apple TV make this setup convenient and easy to maintain. You keep the Mac mini on as a photo server and this Mac becomes the \"master\" library where you will download your different photos coming from point-and-shoot and SLR cameras. \nThe only caveat I see is when you have iPhones, because iPhones sync their picture libraries with iPhoto after each iTunes sync. That would send your pictures back to each individual laptop's iPhoto library rather than to your Mac mini's \"master\" photo library. This means that you may have to keep iTunes from doing this by disabling picture sync on iTunes. \nThen, when you have enough pictures in each one of your iPhones, you would need to sync them with the \"master\" iPhoto library in the Mac mini the same you would an ordinary camera--by connecting it to the Mac mini. I still think is a viable setup, though. Hope this helps and good luck. \n\nA: I have just recently found myself in the same situation, but I also wanted to share my pictures with family over the internet, so my solution is a bit different: I dedicated an external drive to storing photos and videos, in a simple file structure: Year-Month - Occasion (e.g. \"2011-08 - Orlando Vacation\"). \nNow for the sharing part: I am using the free PhotoShow gallery running on my Mac Mini's web server. The main advantage and the number-one reason I chose this software is because it takes the library directly from the hard drive, you don't need to generate galleries, thumbnails, etc. All you have to do is point it to the root of the folder structure holding your photos, and - voila! - instant photo sharing with galleries, thumbnails, ability to save the full-sized picture to the client computer, and if you have a decent internet connection and a static public IP address you can use a free DNS service to have a user-friendly website address like \"myphotosite.freedomainservice.org\"\n", "Q: How can I redownload an episode of podcast that I accidentally deleted? I have accidentally deleted a file of an episode in iTunes podcast. Now whenever I try to play it, I get an error message asking me to locate the file on disk.\n\nI don't have it anymore, and I can't figure out how to tell iTunes to download it again.\nAnother problem is, that if I delete the episode via right click -> delete, I can't get it to show up in the list again, or even download it.\nIs there any simple way to tell iTunes to get the list of episodes again and redownload the ones that aren't available anymore?\n\nA: If you are in \"album\" view, there should still be an \"album\" placeholder for your podcast, even if you do not have any more episodes stored locally in your computer. Right click (or Command click) on the podcast's album/icon and then select the option \"Show All Available Episodes\". This re-downloads the entire list of episodes in the podcast's RSS feed. \nIs important to note that \"Show All Available Episodes\" does not re-download the episodes themselves, but rather the list of episodes. This is the same list that anybody sees in iTunes if they haven't subscribed to the podcast yet. You will be able to select and re-download individual episodes from that list that you have already downloaded and deleted. Hope this helps.\n\nA: For iTunes 11+ delete the episodes as described above then select the ... icon on the top right of the screen and choose Refresh.  Deleted episodes will re-appear in the feed tab and you can re-download them.  \n\nA: If you right click the episode with ! → Show in iTunes Store\nThe episode will show up in the store with a \"Get\" button to the right.\nThat should let you download it.\niTunes is really weird.\n", "Q: Why is the text-to-speech hotkey not working? For some reason, my text to speech isn't working. I don't know why it stopped working. It works when I manually click it, but when using the default hotkey alt+esc, it doesn't do anything.\nI have no idea what happened. How can I fix this? I tried changing hotkeys, but the problem persists.\n\nA: I have found a solution that worked for me without restarting (although restarting worked before when this happened)\nMy problem was that both the Hot Key or the contextual menu Right-Click -> Speech -> Start Speaking did not work within any application like Chrome and Text Edit\nWhen I went to System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Speech -> Play the button toggled to Stop as if playing but I heard no audio.\nMy Solution: I switched my default voice from Heather Infovox iVox HQ to Samantha then pressed the Play button. \nI got audio. \nThen I switched back to Heather and both Hot Key and contextual menu Right-Click -> Speech -> Start Speaking worked without quitting any apps or restarting my computer.\n\nA: I found that these steps worked for me and prevented a reboot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into System Preferences and open Sound\n\n*Select the Output tab.\n\n*Switch to a different output than you are currently using.\n\n*Switch back to Internal Speakers, Headphones, or whatever you typically use.\n\n*Return to Accessibility, Speech and test using the Play button.\n\n\nThese steps worked for me and I'm assuming it might have to do with an application I have installed called Loopback that allows me to record internal audio.  Hope this helps someone else out there that might be experiencing the same issue.\n\nA: Sometimes you just need to reboot your machine. Mine sometimes just stops working. A reboot takes care of it.\n\nA: I had a problem using speech with the Preview app. Turns out something went screwy after adding annotations to the specific document I was looking at and all I had to do was revert it.\n\nA: I have also experience this problem. \nI have found today that shutting Google Chrome and restarting it cures the problem.\nUpdate. This happened again & restarting google chrome did not fix it.\nI ended up closing all my open programs & finder windows & restarting finder then it worked again.  I will update this again next time it fails & try to identify the specific action that fixes it or causes it. \nI have a hunch it may be connected with System Preferences, finder windows or Monitor.\n\nA: Thanks geekinit! I used your idea but in less steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold option and click the speaker(sound/Volume) icon on the top menu bar\n\n*Change to different output device\n\n*Use same technique to switch back to internal speakers or headphones (etc...) \n\n\nThis fixed the problem for me without having to go into system preferences.\n\nA: Maybe try deleting\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n\nMake a copy of it first in case it goes bad. Also, just be careful because it will remove your shortcuts.\n\nA: For me, the fix was: \n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Speech\n\n*change System Voice to something other than what is currently used, such as Samantha. Test it by clicking Play. \n\n*for me, if I select some text and press the keyboard shortcut (option+esc), it works now. \n\n*switch back to the voice you want, such as Alex. It still works with the keyboard shortcut. \n\n\nSo by toggling the voice, it reset something which made the bug goes away. \n\nA: For me, Console showed this error when I tried alt + esc: NSSpeechSynthesizer: [NSSpeechSynthesizer _setObject:forProperty:usingDataSize:] - Error -50\nSo to fix, I went to Activity Monitor, searched for speech, and Force Quit matching processes: corespeechd, com.apple.speech.speechsynthesisd, and Speech Synthesis Server.

I know it might sound like a pretty dumb question, but it's the truth, I have no idea whats going on. You see, my brother used this iMac since the times it had Snow Leopard. I have no idea what he did, undid, redid, or disdid (yeah, I just invented a new word there). \nThe point is now I use this iMac, and I  was blissfully living without knowing some weird thing was going on... until today. I noticed 10.7.2 was released, cool, but it's not on Software Update, so I head to support.apple.com and download the client version manually. \nIt won't let me install.\nHmm... ok. I head to \"About this Mac\" and here is what I see. \n\nPlease notice the \"Version 10.7.1\". Should work, no? Well, I go to \"More Info...\" and, to my surprise, this is what I see. \n\nYup. Mac OS X Lion Server 10.7 (no 10.7.1) and not only that. Please note the build number. Turns out it apparently is the build version of Developer Preview 2. Nevertheless, I go to /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist and surprise! It says:\n\nYeah, thats another build version. It turns out it IS the build version of 10.7.1. So it is 11B26? \n\nMmmmm... no. System Overview says 11A418 too. Half of my mac believes its one version, half believes its the other, and ultimately I can't install 10.7.2: Neither the Server Combo nor the Client Combo. Any ideas why this is happening? Suggestions? Or will I have to make a long distance call to my brother and wait like 4 hours for Lion to download and install agian? Any comments/suggestions welcome!\n\nA: It looks like a developer preview of Lion Server was installed at one point overtop your current consumer version of Lion. You can't do that.\nI can't (under penalty of compromising my confidentiality agreement with Apple) go into detail but installation of Developer seeds are not so simple as to keep installing new versions. There is a process to ensure nothing breaks.\nI assume your brother is not a registered developer and was not made privy to these processes, hence the errors above.\nIn short, your system is hosed. I would recommend reinstallation from either the MAS or using the Recovery HD (boot holding ALT ). It's of note that reinstallation of Lion will not remove the contents of the user profile and aside from having to download the OS, quite painless. Simply boot using the Recovery HD, select the location of the installation (your case, Macintosh HD) and sit back. Once done, you will have a fresh copy of 10.7. Then you can use Software Update to install 10.7.2 (and any other updates you require).\nThen give your brother a good wallop for (allegedly) pirating OS X (and another for his ineptitude and pirating the wrong flavour)!\n\nA: You are obviously using an old Developer Preview version of Lion. The Developer Preview is completely separate from the retail versions of OS X and can't be updated through Software Update. If you want to run the latest developer version of OS X visit developer.apple.com.\n", "Q: Is a me.com address only used for email in iCloud (outside of brand new accounts)? I am one of those people who had an iTunes account way before having an .mac or MobileMe account. Since one can't really merge accounts, I have been trying to decide what to do about my iCloud account. \nAccording to Apple's documentation, their recommended setup is to upgrade your me.com account to iCloud, and then just use your iTunes account for purchases and iTunes in the cloud. \nI am debating on actually NOT fully migrating my MobileMe account to iCloud, and instead upgrading my iTunes account to the iCloud account.\nMy question is this - if I upgrade say my gmail.com account to iCloud, and sign up for a new me.com address - is that address ONLY used for email? \nFor example, if my wife wants to share a calendar with me, she would use my iCloud account (which would be my gmail account), rather than my new me.com email address?\n\nA: Yes, it is only used for email. My Apple ID is an old .mac username which wasn't associated with a MobileMe account. It allowed me to set up iCloud using only that account name. When I turned on iCloud email, it prompted me to set up a new @me.com email address, which I did. But I still use my .mac username to log into icloud.com and access the iTunes store.

Do I have to delete them from my Camera Roll?\n\nA: I copied all the pictures I had in my Photo Stream to my Camera Roll. Just select all of them (I had 250 and it didn't take long), then choose the Save to Camera Roll option. \nAfter I did that, I went to Settings->iCloud->Photo Stream and turned if off. It will warn you that doing this will delete all the pictures you have in Photo Stream, but that's okay since you have copies of them in your Camera Roll. \nNow that the album is deleted, you can select any individual pictures you want to delete / keep from your Camera Roll, and you don't have to deal with Photo Stream anymore!\n\nA: EDIT \nAs of March 7th 2012 you can now delete individual photos from Photo Stream if you are running iOS 5.1 or iPhoto 9.2.2  \n\nBelieve it or not, it seems you can't delete individual photos from iOS5 Photo Stream.   It seems you'll need to wait for them to scroll off as Photo Stream just holds your most recent 1000 pics.  Deleting a picture from Camera Roll has no effect on the photos on Photo Stream.\nAccording to this page:\n\niCloud manages your Photo Stream efficiently so you don't run out of storage space on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. If you have Photo Stream enabled on your iOS device, every single photo you take appears in a special Photo Stream album that holds your last 1000 photos. You can't edit or delete photos from your Photo Stream. If you want to touch up a photo or keep a favorite shot permanently, simply save it to your Camera Roll. iCloud stores new photos for 30 days, so you have plenty of time to connect your iOS device to Wi-Fi and make sure you always have your most recent shots handy.\n\nSo unless you delete it before it's uploaded to the cloud, you need to follow the procedures below.  You need to reset your Photo Stream from iCloud.com or turn off Photo Stream within iOS5 on your device.\nTurn off Photo Stream in iOS5:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > iCloud > Photo Stream\n\n*Switch off and then back on to clear Photo Stream on this device\n\n*Repeat for each iOS5 device  \n\n\nReset Photo Stream on iCloud.com  \n\n\n*\n\n*Sign into iCloud.com\n\n*Click on your name in the upper-right corner\n\n*Click on 'Advanced'\n\n*Click 'Reset Photo Stream' to remove all Photo Stream pictures from iCloud\n\n\nA: I came up with a work-a-round. The instructions to remove selective photos from Photo Stream. It's written for those using iCloud Control Panel to sync with PC. Those with Macs should be able to get the same result if they substitute for the Photo Stream folders that are used with iPhoto, or Aperture. So for instructions to remove just a few photos Go here:\nhttp://gnasty.wordpress.com/2011/10/18/iclouds-photostream-photos-undeletable/\nI do have to warn you this is by no means convenient, but it works for now until we get an update. Let me know what you guys think.\nAlso: \nI'm not sure you guys know this, or not, but if you turn off and on Photo Stream on your device, it erases the photo stream files just for that device. No iCloud.com reset needed. So basically after you take a bunch of photos, and don't want the wasted space cycle photo stream on and off just on your phone. Your pictures will still be backed up in the cloud and on your computer, but will NOT sync back to your phone again unless you upload them manually using iCloud Control Panel. \nI hope that helps out some people neither solutions are perfect.\nIt would be real nice if apple would add support for deletion, but I'm starting to think it has something to do with the difficulty setting rules for how multiple devices handle editing the same files in the cloud. Redundancy is the safest bet to avoid data loss.\n\nA: Go to settings on your iPhone and there is a new added title of iCloud. Turn photo streaming off and it asks you if you want to delete the photos. choose \"yes\" then when you go to your photos folder back at the main menu, you will see that the streaming photos are deleted.\n\nA: You can go to your Settings. When there, click on iCloud. You simply scroll down to the 'Photo Stream' and make it say off! \nIt will delete the \"automatic uploads\" from you camera as well as delete  the Photo Stream album in your photo library. \nI had this problem. I deleted the album. Now I have just one album: Camera Roll. The photo stream album is now deleted. I can take and delete photos with out there being anything permanent!\n\nA: I had same issue to Delete Undeletable Photos On iPhone you need to make fake folder with no images in it .... here is the video which how to do that....\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRlEO1kMUmI\n", "Q: Can I put Newsstand into a folder? In iOS5 (and later) my newsstand icon will not go into a folder on either my iPod touch, or my iPad2. Anyone have any suggestions on how to move this application?\n\nA: I've put in the last screen, all alone, so I never have to see that\n\nA: If you don't mind Jailbreaking your device, several apps allow this. One such app is NoNewsIsGoodNews which runs as an application.\nhttp://opinionativereviewer.com/archives/3683\n\nA: Actually, you can put Newsstand into a folder- from Mac or Windows. Just install\nStifleStand (free)\nIt's really a simple application and does not require a jailbreak. I've just tested it from an iPod touch 4th gen and it really \"just works\".  However, note that tapping Newsstand once its in its folder causes it Springboard to crash (as mentioned by above answers).  This could be useful for a little SpringBoard restart for those who don't want to jailbreak!\n\nA: Looks like there is a way after all (even if it's most probably a bug because it renders Newsstand useless):\nFrom The Coding Massacre:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take two apps and go to create a folder\n\n*The second the apps are in the folder and it’s doing the folder creation animation, drag Newsstand into the folder\n\n*As long as you’re quick enough Newsstand will go into the folder\n\n\nIf you open Newsstand while it’s in a folder your springboard will crash. \n\nA: Newsstand behaves as a folder itself.  In the same way as you cannot nest folders within folders, Newsstand cannot be placed inside any other folder.  \nAs a side note, jailbreaking makes folder nesting possible.\nYou can actually get it in a folder by making a new folder and very quickly placing it in as a third item, but launching newsstand from within a folder usually causes things to crash in the phone. Furthermore, the system cleans this up when it notices it - so you have a very short term win in terms of getting newsstand in to another folder.\nUntil this changes in the OS - the safest thing is to move it out of sight.\n\nA: With the latest iOS 7, you can place Newsstand in a folder without having to buy apps or jailbreak your device. \n\nA: Just install the new iOS 7 (free from Apple via iTunes).\nJailbreaking and similar \"hacking\" procedures usually cause more problems than they promise to solve...\n", "Q: Do I need to re-index my Volume?

I have family members planning a party for next month, and they're looking to get a single audio track/playlist streaming across the house. Their current solution is to pick up another AirPort Express (we already have a couple), attach 2.1 speakers to each one, and use a single iTunes instance to stream to all of the speakers wirelessly.\nI know iTunes already supports multiple speaker outputs, but I've never tried with multiple wireless speakers (it's always been one internal and one wireless). Will the various devices keep their audio outputs synchronized with each other? They'd very much like to avoid a sound jitter or lag, even slight, from becoming noticeable when walking from room to room.\nIf iTunes won't do this, will a third-party app (e.g. Airfoil) suffice? It'll all be iTunes audio, so I don't think we'd need Airfoil for anything but synchronization; even so, that may be reason enough, if iTunes won't handle audio sync on its own.\n\nA: According to Wikipedia:\n\nThe AirTunes part of the AirPlay protocol stack uses UDP for streaming\n  audio and is based on the RTSP network control protocol.[12] The\n  streams are encrypted with AES, requiring the receiver to have access\n  to the appropriate private key to decrypt the streams.[13] The AirPort\n  Express' streaming media capabilities use Apple's Remote Audio Output\n  Protocol (RAOP), a proprietary variant of RTSP/RTP. Using\n  WDS-bridging,[14] the AirPort Express can allow AirPlay functionality\n  (as well as Internet access, file and print sharing, etc.) across a\n  larger distance in a mixed environment of wired and up to 10 wireless\n  clients.\n\nSee the page here.\nNotice the part where it says that UDP is used for streaming audio.\nUDP does no error correction.  When using TCP (most of the time), when I send a packet from A to B, I send it, I get confirmation, then I send the next packet.  When I get confirmation, part of that confirmation is an error check code.  If it doesn't match with the error check code that I generated when I first sent the packet, I know the data has been malformed in some way before reaching B, and therefore I send it again.\nIf I have to send that packet a bunch of times before it is successfully read on the other side, that would \"sound like\" something unexpected.  Lag is a bit different -- lag happens when there's a delay of some sort, or the line is saturated and it actually takes (some arbitrary amount of) time for the signal to get there.  That could happen under either model.\nThe difference is, with UDP, if packets get lost or corrupt, it doesn't matter.  iTunes will send whatever data is required to represent the song now.  And now, and now.  If you miss it or it gets malformed, oh well.  It will keep sending only what is pertinent now.\nLong story short:  you should be fine.  Any glitches will probably be short and sweet.  And, out of sync?  Probably not discernible to any human.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi sync missing from iTunes 10.5 This is really weird. I updated my iPhone to iOS 5 today, along with iTunes to version 10.5. According to Apple's own documentation, I should have an option to \"sync with this iPhone over wifi\" under the Summary tab when my iPhone is plugged in - but I don't!\nSince I can't enable it, my iPhone doesn't \"see\" my computer when I go to Settings > General > iTunes Wi-Fi Sync on my iPhone, even though both are on the same network.\nThe only thing I can think of is that it's because I'm running OS X 10.5? But I still have iTunes 10.5 and iOS 5, which is all that Apple says is required (they don't list a minimum required version of OS X itself).\nAnyone have any idea how I can enable this?\n\nA: I believe the minimum requirements are iOS 5 iTunes 10.5 and Snow Leapard 10.6.8. I have Leapard 10.5.8 (and the other requirements) I can't use wifi sync. The option isn't in iTunes. I saw someone say somewhere that they had 10.6.7 and they did have the option until they updated snow leapard to 10.6.8.\n\nA: I just fixed this issue by restarting my macbook's wifi. \n", "Q: Is it possible to change file status (from read only to read and write) for multiple files/folders at once? I moved all my web files/folders from my default MAMP directory to a more manageable location. Now all the files and folders have been changed to read only. \nI figured out how to change the status per one by one, but that would take a lot of time. Is there a way to change all the files and folders to \"read and write\" all at once\n\nA: Open terminal and try the following; putting the path of your new directory behind the /:\nchmod -R o+rw /path/to/your/new/directory\n\n-R means recursively change the permissions of all files in the directory, with the arguments ( o+rw ):\no ( the other users), alternatively u (for user) or g (for group)\nr ( read )\nw ( write )\n\n\nA: Better to just give the permissions you're looking for:\nchmod -R g+w Music\n\n-R -- recursive\ng+w -- give write privileges to the group (which includes osx system-level users)\nMusic -- the relative (or /Music for an absolute) path to the new Folder.  \nObviously, in case you didn't figure it out, you need to run this in Terminal.app\n", "Q: Do I need an internet connection to update iOS on my PC? I've downloaded the IOS5 IPSW from Apple's site and want to update it from within iTunes. So, \n\n\n*\n\n*Does the update require an Internet connection?\n\n*Does the iPhone switch off/reboot just as the update is initiated?\n\n\nI ask because I'm at my new place where I'm yet to setup an Internet connection & my iPhone tethered to my laptop is my only Internet connection. I don't want my phone to be bricked because it cannot verify the update or what-not because there's no Internet connection.\n\nA: Yes it does. It has to verify the firmware with Apple's servers (gs.apple.com). If it cannot, it will error out (usually presenting a 3XXX error, which is quite often 3004) and fail to update.\n\nA: it does require internet. Just made the answer short.\n", "Q: App sharing in iOS 5 I have shared my App Store account with my family member not to purchase the same app twice. It has been simple so far. Just enter the same Apple ID in two devices. \nNow we have iOS 5 and iCloud. Is it possible to use two different Apple ID in App Store and iCloud in the same device?\nIf it is not possible, how could we share App purchases with personally using own iCloud functionality?\n\nA: See Apple's excellent FAQ on multiple App Store and iCloud Accounts: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4895\nParticularly these sections:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the same Apple ID for Store purchases and iCloud (recommended)\n\n*Using an individual Apple ID for iCloud and a (different) shared Apple ID for Store\nPurchases\n\n\nA: The iCloud login is separate to the App Store login.

I'm using Lion 10.7.2 which I upgraded today and all those problems arose after that upgrade.\nNote: There is nothing wrong with Apache config files or any other file with the local web server, I know that it's the /etc/hosts file that causes the problem.\nThanks.\n\nA: All additional entries to the HOSTS file must be above the:\nfe80::1%lo0\n\nMake sure there is at least one line break after the last entry. Like so:\n127.0.0.1 LLL.localhost\n127.0.0.1 LLL.localhost\n#\n\nAlthough you probably can't tell, there is another line following the # symbol. One more thing to mention, using Space instead of Tab between 127.0.0.1 and localhost might help too.\n\nA: You'll need to follow ioi's answer to the T to get this to work correctly.

When setting up iCloud in my iOS 5 iPhone 4, there is a new @me.com address created (Settings > iCloud > Account > Advanced > Mail \nIs this new @me.com a full feature mailbox? \n\nA: Yes - iCloud includes full mail service - webmail, IMAP and iOS for free and not counting against your free 5 Gb of cloud storage quota.\nhttp://www.apple.com/icloud/ mentions that iCloud is free with iOS 5. Enjoy!\n\nA: I've been using my mac.com and me.com address as my main address since iTools day (when the predecessor to Mac.com was free). Never had any reason to use anything else. I have gmail, but only use it for business emails mostly.\niCloud has a web interface for it, and the Mail.app on iDevices and Macs all use it for their main account. Works well most of the time, though there were a few hiccups tonight with the server authenticating my password. But that seems to have passed.\n\nA: @bmike is correct that iCloud is a full mail service. But, it counts against your free 5 GB of cloud storage:\nFrom Apple:\n\nFree gets you a lot. When you sign up for iCloud, you automatically get 5GB of free storage. And that’s plenty of room, because of the way\n  iCloud stores your content. Your purchased music, movies, apps, books,\n  and TV shows — as well as your Photo Stream — don’t count against your\n  free storage.

I'm looking to setup with iCloud, and I'm concerned with their desire to sync my contacts, calendars, and bookmarks.  While I'm fine with the bookmarks, I am legitimately concerned about contacts and calendars since I consider that the domain of Gmail Contacts and Google Calendar, which I've had synced via Gmail Sync for some time now.  \nWill iCloud sync interfere with Gmail sync?  Or does iCloud simply offer me another layer of redundancy?\n\nA: With iCloud, you can choose which areas to sync and which not to.  However, if you do choose to sync contacts and/or calendar, I believe you will simply end up with some double events on your phone, which can easily be cleared up by disabling view of the extra calendars.\nIn short, syncing contacts, calendar, music, and photos are all separate and can be enabled/disabled as such.\nAnd yes, it does, in some way offer you additional redundancy as the Apple cloud and Google cloud are likely housed in different data centers...but this would require you to keep both calendars in sync, which I don't think will be easy to do without being annoyed absurdly.\n\nA: Yes, iCloud seems to interfere with google contact syncing.  When you try to enable iCloud contact syncing on 10.7.2, you will see a dialog that will force you to disable Google Contact syncing. See How can I use iCloud to sync my contacts, while also syncing my contacts with Google?\n\nA: Yes, best to stick to one sync. Just had the fun of having to delete lots of merged information. Trust me  you dpn't want to go there\n", "Q: How to look up your contacts and see who can I talk with iMessage? How can we quick look at our contacts and see how is having iMessage or not? So we can easily contact them, instead of going through all contacts one by one to check them.\n\nA: The feature you are looking for does not exist in iOS 5.0. I guess the reasoning is that you just want to send a message to your contacts and the device will send it via the appropriate route, favouring iMessage where it is available.\nThe closest you can get to seeing who has iMessage available without visiting each contact's card individually is if you go to send a new message, type 'a' in the To: field and you'll get a phone-number drop down. As you scroll, those contacts with iMessage available will have a little blue speech bubble to the right of their name and number (or email address).\n\nOther that that, when you're sending a message...\nIf the Contact's Name and the Send button are green, then they don't have iMessage available and you'll send them an SMS (or MMS).\n\nIf the Contact's Name and the Send button are blue, then they do have iMessage available and you'll use that.\n\n\nA: I have been searching for a month but didn't find any method any trick not any 3rd party app or not even a Cydia tweak to identify all my iMessage users & the point of hitting compose new and add a user to check if it turns green or blue.\nIn short there's no way you can find it so don't waste your precious time for searching. \n", "Q: How to use SMTP and IMAP with iCloud email? I've never used @me.com or @mac.com emails before. Neither did I use MobileMe.\nSo when the iCloud came out last night I created @me.com email account this morning.

Email account was added to Mail.app.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to setup SMTP as Sending emails doesn't work?\n\n*\n\n*In the iCloud email account settings the SMTP account is set to iCloud (iCloud) which occasionally is displayed as iCloud (iCloud, Offline) - this has been set by the iCloud config when creating the @me.com account\n\n*The above iCloud SMTP is not listed in the SMTP servers list\n\n*Connection Doctor doesn't check the outgoing iCloud setting either - just as if it didn't exist.\n\n*According to Apple's KnowledgeBase on iCloud Email the SMTP server is smtp.mail.me.com, but Mail.app reports an invalid SSL certificate\n\n\n*What would be IMAP settings for the new @me.com accounts?\n\n*\n\n*Mainly asking because the settings iCloud config set are not all filled in and are not following the earlier linked support document, e.g.:\n\n*\n\n*username is the <username>@me.com, not the full address\n\n*incoming mail server is p06-imap.mail.me.com and it is grayed out\n\n*password field is empty\n\n\n*Receiving emails does work though, not sure why\n\n\n\nSo, any tips on getting the @me.com working properly? All other iCloud services seem to work fine.\n\nEdit\nIt seems to have started working for me without any tweaks. I simply had it disabled for last couple of days, enabled now and it started working without any intervention on my side.\n\nA: Interestingly I had a similar problem last night, and I have been using iCloud for some time now. I suspect it was caused by the live switch on iCloud. I simply went to the iCloud preference panel, logged out and logged back in. The new terms and conditions was shown, I accepted, restarted Mail and everything was working.\nI suggest trying this first, because manually configuring it can cause problems in future should Apple decide to make changes to the routes.\nThe IMAP setting for iCloud is available in this Apple support document.\n\nA: Not sure if this helps but been a mobile me user for a year now and this is my outlook 2007 settings:\nAlso worth noting I have seen in small print that iCloud will only work with Outlook 2007 & 2010\nAccount type:  imap\nIncoming mail server:  mail.me.com\nOutgoing mail server:  smtp.me.com\n\n\n*\n\n*(I note that Apple's KB of this states:  smtp.mail.me.com i.e. mine does not have \"mail\" in it).\nUser name:  (_ _ _ _ _)@me.com (don't put in @me.com though)\nTick require logon using SPA\non advanced tab:\noutgoing server tab\nmy outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication:  tick this\nuse same settings as my incoming mail server:  click this\nAdvanced tab\nIncoming server (IMAP):  993\nUse following type of encrypted connection:  SSL\nOutgoing server (SMTP):  587\nUse following type of encrypted connection:  TLS\nSo far my account is still working but have not upgraded to iOS5 or iCloud yet as waiting for update to another program that I use to bypass iTunes for music importing.\n\nA: Since nobody really put that as an answer I'd do it myself.\nThe answer is to simply wait. iCloud is at its infancy and is being accessed by potentially millions of customers so it may not work properly yet. Give it some time and things should work normally in couple of days. For me it was 5.\n\nA: As noted by Michal M above, the outgoing mail server (smtp.mail.me.com) does not talk SSL, but it does apparently talk TLS, which is apparently as secure as SSL (see http://luxsci.com/blog/ssl-versus-tls-whats-the-difference.html). After unchecking the \"Use SSL\" box on the Advanced tab for the outgoing mail server in Apple's Mail.app, I am able to send mail from my @me account using the Mail.app.\nI've seen other posts on other boards that said smtp.mail.me.com talked TLS.  I've been away from network stuff for a while, but when I have the \"Use SSL\" box checked, the \"Connection Doctor\" in Apple's Mail.app shows the following as the last attempted communications with smtp.mail.me.com before it tells me it can't send the message:\nWROTE Oct 25 13:38:06.435 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone]  -- host:smtp.mail.me.com -- port:587 -- socket:0xbc912f0 -- thread:0xbc26770 STARTTLS\nREAD Oct 25 13:38:06.562 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone]  -- host:smtp.mail.me.com -- port:587 -- socket:0xbc912f0 -- thread:0xbc26770 220 2.5.0 Go ahead with TLS negotiation.\nI suspect it hangs there because Mail.app wants to use SSL (on top of the request to STARTTLS?), and smtp.mail.me.com wants to use TLS (only?).\nI don't know the best way to get Apple to update their KnowledgeBase document (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4864), which clearly says the \"use SSL\" box should be checked.\n\nA: if you want to use Pine or Alpine as a mail client, you have some problems.

(I don't have that much free space in C, but I have it in another partition.)\nI have already reinstalled iTunes in my secondary partition (300 GB free) and moved the Preferences > Advanced iTunes Media to my secondary.\nBut still when I try to update to iOS 5, iTunes tells me there is not enough free space (it still wants to use the C: drive).\nAre there any other settings I should check?\n\nA: I think that iTunes is trying to use your gobal Windows temporary folder. By default, this directory is in your user Local Settings directory, located on the same drive as Windows. This is a system-wide setting that applications are supposed to follow.\nYou can change the path to this temporary folder by changing the value of the TEMP environment variable. You'll have to restart iTunes after changing the variable to have it take effect.\n\nA: Itunes uses the folder \"%appdata%\\Apple Computer\\iTunes\\ipad software updates\" to store the iOS 5 update and uncompress it. If you don't have enough space on C: drive, you need to move this folder in order to be able to do the iOS 5 update.\nSince iTunes thoughtfully left out any means of doing this, you need to get your hands dirty.\n\n\n*\n\n*close iTunes.\n\n*Cut and paste the folder \"%appdata%\\apple computer\\itunes\\ipad software updates\" to a different drive or partition with at least 30 GB free. Eg. D:\\ipad\\ipad software updates\n\n*download junction (http://download.sysinternals.com/Files/Junction.zip) and unzip in to C:\n\n*Click on \"Start\", select \"Run\". Type in \"cmd\" to open a DOS window.\n\n*Type in \"cd..\" and hit Enter. Keep repeating until the DOS prompt changes to \"C:>\"\n\n*Type in : junction \"%appdata%\\apple computer\\itunes\\ipad software updates\" \"D:\\ipad\\ipad software updates\"\n\n\nDone.\n\nA: Success; I solved it!!!!\nThe answer is with two parts, no dealing with the registry. One is changing the TEMP variable to D:\\temp (or whatever the second hard drive is). The other does involve junction, but you got the wrong directory.\nWhile you got the right directory for where iTunes keeps downloads, that particular file is relatively small and not where it extracts to (where all the space is eaten). The initial dmg files are extracted to C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\iTunes\\Temp . \"All Users\" seems static. The \"Temp\" part is dynamic (is created at the operation and deleted after) and appears to be hard coded in iTunes 10, so I moved the \"iTunes\" folder from above to the other drive, then made the junction point to \"D:\\Temp\\Apple\\iTunes\" (you do where you want; I made \"Apple\" read only to avoid autodeleting and invalidating the junction. Overkill, but I was trying to work quickly- probably not a good idea to link to a sub off %TEMP%).\nAnyway, worked like a charm. The initial extraction of the download went to the linked directory on D:, then the DMG files were extracted in to %TEMP%\\$app(n) and the iPod was soon rescued after that.\n\nA: Just like @cksum said in response to your question: move ten gigs of files from your C: drive to your secondary, update to iOS 5, and move the files back. It's not like iTunes is going to keep using the space after the update is complete.\n", "Q: iCloud calendar not sending invites As in the title. iCloud calendar is not sending invites to people being invited. No matter whether I try via icloud.com or iCal.app synced with iCloud - it just doesn't. No events no updates. Tested sending to a gmail address and at least two other.\nWhy doesn't it?\n\nA: Here's what I found: when you send an iCloud calendar invite to someone's email address, if that address happens to be their AppleID username that is now also associated with iCloud, then Apple tries to outsmart the users, and routes that calendar invite instead to the recipient's AppleID/iCloud account calendar.\nHere's a thread I started on it: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1267665\n\nA: I have found when I do not include a location with the invite it goes through.  I have even edited earlier invites and removed the location and the invite is received\n\nA: The problem still exists...\nHowever, Google Gmail is smart to ignore any suffix in your gmail address following a '+' sign.\nIf your gmail is first.last@gmail.com, then any first.last+anything_i_can_add@gmail.com will go to your inbox.\nYou can use this trick to ask your iCloud contacts to use a fake but valid address like first.last+icloud@gmail.com address when they invite you.\nThis way, the Apple server logic is fooled, but you still receive all the notifications.\n\nA: Found this @ http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/gtpX0F7kgKI\nFor what it's worth, I started having a similar issue recently and came across this thread while researching the solution. My wife has an iPhone, I'm Android, and she routinely sends calendar invites to me. We just realized that I've recently stopped getting those invites to my Gmail account, even though she's still adding me the same way she always has. It turns out that since my iCloud account is setup with my Gmail address, iCloud has started to \"intercept\" those invites from her iPhone. Instead of going to my email account, they're being automatically added to my iCalendar. This can be disabled by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logging in at https://www.icloud.com\n\n*Go to Calendar -> (Cog) -> Preference -> Advanced \n\n*Beside \"Invitations\" select Email To  (Use this option if your primary calendar is not iCloud).\n\n\nThis may solve your problem if:\n\n\n*\n\n*Someone with an iDevice is sending your the invite.\n\n*You have an iCloud account.\n\n\nA: Ok we have found a possible answer to this issue:  \n\n\n*\n\n*If you are using any other mail address other than icloud.com as your apple id all your invitation is being redirected to your icloud calendar.\n\n*If you do not sync your icloud calendar then you will remain unaware of the invitation.\n\n*You can correct this by logging in to iCloud, accessing the calendar preferences and going to the advance tab and tick the bottom box to not use in app serviced but to send mail to your primary address\n\n\nPlease can someone force Apple to make this a default setting as the world is not on iCloud yet\n\nA: My was not working either as of yesterday.  I went into all of my events that I created yesterday and edited them to reflect a change so that an update email would have to be sent out.  I did this to check if they were working and they myself and all of the invitees WERE sent emails this time. \nNot real sure why, but it seems to be working now.  Creating new events with invites also seems to work now.  Go figure.\n\nA: As in my previous problem with iCloud - it took a little bit of time for it to start working.\nIt's also worth noting, that calendar invites don't get delivered to email accounts that are configured in your Mail.app.\n\nA: The person you are sending this to is using the email address as the log into iCloud.  That person needs to log into iCloud and go to calendar on the bottom left is a gear click it go to preference and then up top click on advance.  At the bottom on invitations In app should be highlighted as default under it click on use my email.\n\nA: Seems to be new iCloud accounts, that hasn't assigned with phone number can't send invites, but can accept them.\nI've just created new iCloud (with gmail email) account, logon on the iPhone w/o SIM and no one invite was send to contacts. I've tried: phone numbers, different email addresses, via iPhone / iCloud.com, and get no inapp invite, no email.\nAt the same time, I've received invitations in this account.\nProbably, Apple denying sending invites from unphoned accounts to reduce calendar  spam. But nothing that said in KB\n", "Q: \"This Apple ID is valid but is not an iCloud account\" Trying to sign into iCloud on my Macbook and I get this error message. I've also had some trouble signing into the same account with iCloud on iPad and iPhone, but the messages there are even more vague.\nMy Apple ID is a gmail address - not anything from iTools/Mobile Me and existed as an Apple ID before iCloud was released. \n\nA: Go into System Preferences » Users and Groups » and then under your name on your login it says Apple ID. Put your details in there and that should sort out your problem. Well, at least it did for me.\n\nA: A little late to respond, but on Catalina I had the same problem and resolved by opening the app store, signing in there, and then enabling 2-factor authentication in system preferences. Shortly after I was able to successfully login to icloud as well.\n\nA: Open iCloud preferences, check box for \"Mail\" and register new ID which must ends with @me.com.\nyour iCloud id must be different than your @gmail.com Apple ID. I have same settings and everything works well.\nOfficial FAQ about Apple ID and iCloud ID: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4895\n\nA: Oddly enough, putting in the Apple ID under System Preferences, Users and Groups did the job for me as well. I did receive an incomplete operation error the first time I tried (you'll see a yellow cautionary triangle if you have the same problem). I simply had to enter it again. Once the ID and Password was accepted I went to iCloud and was able to proceed. Now I have to upgrade iPhoto... one problem at a time ;).\n\nA: At first, you should be sure your account is not webonly format. If your account is in web only format.

I've had an iPhone of various vintages for 3 years connected to MS Exchange activesync for work email.\nPart of the deal with this that you need to enter a four digit PIN before you unlock. \nI was quite excited about the iOS5 camera option available from the lock screen. \nFrom what I can see - the camera shortcut is not available if you have ActiveSync enabled and thus the four digit PIN. I'm asking the question because I hope I am wrong. Here is my question:\nDoes the ActiveSync Pin code lock prevent the new camera shortcut?\n\nA: No, the PIN Code doesn't prevent you from using the camera shortcut.\nJust make sure to double-press the home button to show the camera shortcut.\nNote: you can't access your old photos as long as the iPhone is locked.\n", "Q: Why does the iTunes artist list jump to start when I scroll it? I updated my iTunes yesterday, along with Lion, as did a lot of other people. Now I've been experiencing some weird behaviour.\n\nI have my iTunes setup like above. I usually browse to artist by typing the first few letters of their name, and the list jumps down to the results. It still does that. However, when I scroll the list afterwards it jumps to the very top of the list, regardless of scroll direction.\nHave anyone experience similar problems? And if so, how have you solved it?\nEdit: Problem has been solved in the new iTunes 10.5.1\n\nA: It's probably scrolling to where the cursor is, and since you searched, the cursor has been reset and moved to the top of the list.  Click once in the list to select a visible item, then scroll.\n", "Q: Why is the Location Services icon always present? I updated my iPhone 4 to iOS 5 last night. In iOS 4, the purple GPS arrow appeared next to the battery indicator when an app I was using (or had running in the background) was actively accessing my location data. Now, it seems to be on all the time, even when I have no apps running. \nDoes this icon now simply denote the fact that I have Location Services turned on, instead of notifying me that they are being used (like it used to)? \n\nA: Ah - I fiddled around with a few different apps and discovered that Foursquare was the culprit. When Foursquare's new Radar feature is on, it is always using your location data, even when the app itself is not running. I've turned it off for now, since I don't want it running my battery down unnecessarily. \n\nA: It's a new feature in ios 5 called \"region Monitoring\"\nThe reason it's active even if the app is closed is that this feature runs in iOS 5 core and notifies all apps that are registered when they have entered or left a specific geo-fence.\nReminders does that when you use a location based reminder.\nAlthough the location icon appears at all time. This actually has very minimal impact on the battery due to apple really optimizing this feature by using cell and wifi mostly.\n\nA: Since it's a new iOS 5 feature, I'll add some information (even though it's not your problem).  \n\nStarting with iOS 5, you can ask the system to notify you when your location is being used.\nYou can find the relevant options in Preferences > Location Services > System Services.\nThere you can choose iOS 5 services that are allowed to geolocate:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cell Network Search\n\n*Compass Calibration\n\n*Diagnostics & Usage\n\n*Location-Based iAds\n\n*Setting Time Zone\n\n*Traffic\n\n\nYou can also specify whether or not to show the icon in the status bar.\nAlso, a grey icon in front of an application in Preferences > Location Services means that the app has used your location in the last 24 hours. If the icon is blue, the application is using it right now.\n\nSo you could have known right away which app was the culprit.\n\nA: My location services icon was always on due to the Setting Time Zone locations service always being active. This is an Apple bug which does not happen on all devices and DOES drain your battery life considerably.\nIf you want to prove it just turn on the Time Zone locations service and before you put your phone onto charge at night go to Settings > General > Usage and take note of the time since last charged. Then do the same the following night and you will see a dramatic difference.\nThis is a known bug which Apple intend to fix in the near future but anyone who says Location Services does not drain the the battery in your iPhone quicker does not know what they are talking about. This service is only used if you want your phone to update its time zone when you travel to different countries. Which you can do by switching it on for a short period when you get to your destination, let the time update then turn it back off again.\n\nA: I was same problem \nI just done reset all setting from general \nThat's it it is gone\n", "Q: Buying from the App Store at work Our company has various Mac computers that need to purchase software from the Mac App Store. This includes Apple software like Keynote or the Lion update, but also apps from third-party developers.\nCurrently we have one Apple id linked to the company credit card which we use to make purchases. However, we're only charged once per app (good for us; bad for the developer) and we suspect there might be a device limit.\nWhat is the recommended or right way of purchasing from the App Store at work?\n\nA: \nWhen you buy an app on the Mac App Store, you’re getting the rights to\n  run that program on any Macs you own and operate, for your personal\n  use. Basically, if your household has a half-dozen different Macs,\n  including desktops and laptops, you can buy a copy of Gratuitous Space\n  Battles and play it on every single one of them. Consider a purchase\n  of consumer software via the Mac App Store to be a bit like buying a\n  household site license for the app.\nThe situation is slightly different for apps that are considered\n  commercial or professional in nature. For apps that fall into this\n  category—Aperture’s a good example—the Mac App Store license says that\n  you essentially can install that item on computers you use or on a\n  single computer shared by multiple people. Basically think of it as a\n  one-seat license for a pro app.\nIn other words, the Mac App Store’s purchasing system is not designed\n  so that a podcasting company can spend $15 for GarageBand and equip 30\n  different Macs with a copy. But if you want to buy a game and put it\n  on your desktop Mac, your laptop, your wife’s laptop, and your\n  daughter’s laptop, go for it.\n\nFind the full article here :\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/157018/2011/01/appstore_licensing.html\n\nA: There is no device limit on the Mac App Store, so if you have a single Apple ID that is shared by the whole company you'll be able to use the single copy you purchased everywhere.\nFor the iOS App Store, Apple has a volume purchasing program that lets you buy multiple copies of an app and install it on your company's iThings, but this doesn't apply to the Mac App Store. I haven't been able to find any information on a Mac App Store version of the program anywhere.\n", "Q: How to set a default Calendar in iCal 10.7.2 Since I activated iCloud, iCal has changed the default calendar to new events to one which I do not want to use.\nHow can I change the default calendar for iCal?

Only after setting up my girlfriend's and my own Lion user account to sync with iCloud did I discover that the address book still doesn't lend itself to sharing in the way that calendar does :-(\nWe currently use a single iTunes library on my user account for syncing both of our iPhones to a single address book, where all her contacts are in a folder called \"girlfriend's contacts\". This allows us to share our contacts but still (in a way) keep them separate.\nWhat I'd like is for her to keep all of her contacts in her own, separate address book in her existing user account on my computer. We would then share our address books with one another (read-only or not).\nIs there a work-around using iCloud or any other service? I guess we could continue syncing our contacts in the old way via my iTunes library (effectively mirroring our combined contacts in two separate iCloud accounts), but that's not very elegant...\n\nA: You can set up multiple different iCloud accounts in the \"Mail, Contacts, and Calendars\" preference panel, and also on your iPhone and iPads.\nI have accomplished a shared address book with my partner by each of us having a primary iCloud account (me@us.com, her@us.com) - and then a shared iCould account us@us.com.\nOne annoying downside is that the Lion Address Book app labels both address books as \"iCloud\" making it a bit hard to distinguish what contacts are where.  We solve this by having different contact lists in each address book, so they are distinct.\nIt seems with just a little bit of work Apple could make this MUCH better, but this is the best solution I have seen so far.\n", "Q: After add a page to my \"read later\" list, and go off-line, where's the page for me to read?

MacOSXHints is the place to watch for this kind of thing.\nI have created folders in effect by dropping similar apps onto each other.  All QuickTime apps are together.  All Maintenance Apps are together, as are media viewing apps, etc.  I also move the least used apps to page 2\nThis reduces the number of pages for Launchpad and makes apps more accessible for me.

My iPhoto and iTunes library is taking up most of the space in my 128GB SSD MBP. \nI'm considering to buy a mac mini to store all of my media for iPhoto and iTunes libraries and sync a few of my favourite playlists/events to my MBP.\nIs this possible? If not, is it better to just buy a 'Little Big Disk' and store everything there and back it up via my Time capsule(can this be done too?)?\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't easily do Mac-to-Mac syncing of iTunes libraries in that manner. Your best options for networked iTunes access are:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Library Sharing: put your library on the server, and you can get streaming access from your MBP. Downsides: no remote/offline access, you need to be on the same network as the server; all media/playlist management has to be done on the server.\n\n*iTunes Home Sharing: same streaming access as above, but you can also copy files from the server to your MBP. Downsides: it's not syncing, you need to manually select and transfer the songs you want.\n\n*Store iTunes Library on a Network Share: change the iTunes folder location (Advanced section in the iTunes Preferences) to a shared network drive on the server (or any shared drive, doesn't have to be a Mac). This gets you local control of the library, just like any standard functions. Downsides: have to be on the local network to get access. \n\n\n*\n\n*With this option you could make a second library (option-click iTunes when you open it) on the local drive with a smaller collection of songs you want for off-network access, but again, you don't have any syncing abilities, you have to manually add what you want.\n\n\n\nI don't know that much about iPhoto sharing, I think it's more limited, but you can always put the iPhoto Library on a network share, as in the third option above, with the same limitations. There's also iCloud's Photo Stream, which is fairly limited, but may work if you just want to get recent photos from point A to B.\n\nA: Don't yet have a solution for iPhoto, but check this shiznit out - Requires iTunes Match\n100% BACK UP YOUR MAC\n\n\n*\n\n*Move your iTunes library to an external HD\n\n*Create a second profile on your Macbook (NO NEW COMPUTER NEEDED!) - Let's call this profile \"iTunes Host\"\n\n*Log into iTunes Host.\n\n*Open iTunes, direct it to your external HD for your library (better info about how to do this available online)\n\n*Set up iTunes Match\n\n*Go to Profile 1. Delete connection to iTunes Library (again, look online for best info)\n\n*Connect to iTunes Match\n\n\nVoila! You now have access to your entire iTunes Library with just an $100 external HD.\n", "Q: What to do with \"There was a problem enabling iCloud Backup\" on iPad? I just upgraded to iOS 5 on my iPad and during the intro session it asks you if you want to \"back up to iCloud\".  Choosing yes, gives the error \"There was a problem enabling iCloud Backup\".  Any ideas?\n\nA: The iCloud System Status page lists several problems on 13 October.\nOthers have said they had the same problem, so maybe one of the troubleshooting pages linked from the iCloud Backup Support page might help?\nLater: Yes, it does help. this linked page 'iCloud: troubleshooting creating backups' lists specific error messages and says of yours:\n\n\"There was a problem enabling iCloud Backup.\"\nThere are various reasons that this can occur.

I was looking for a way to sync my reminders from Google Calendar with the reminders app in iOS 5.\nI have Google Sync set up, and on my \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" settings page, it says \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders\" are being synced with Google Sync, but reminders created on the gmail tasks (or google calendar tasks) do not show up on the phone, and vice versa.\nWhat can I do to get them to sync?\n--update:\nMacworld says:\n\nYou can also save your tasks to Google Calendar or Exchange servers,\n  which then handle the syncing separately.\n\nBut it doesn't say how to do it...\n\nA: Update: Tasket is no longer an option it seems, original answer below.\nBeware: url now as it leads to suspicious ad-popups.\n\nTasket seems to be the solution for this problem.\n\nYour iOS Device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) talks to Tasket, and Tasket talks to your Gmail account. Now you can now use the native Reminders app to manage your Gmail tasks!\n\nTasket is currently in beta right now,  but it looks very promising.\n\n\nA: As I understand it from http://www.google.com/mobile/sync/ the Google Sync (push-email) doesn't currently support Tasks, so even if the iPhone page says Tasks (as it's using the Exchange protocol) Google won't actually do anything with tasks yet\n\nA: I would have suggested Google Tasks Porter (a Google app which is designed to import/export Google tasks). However, Google Tasks Porter has long been dead. \nTasket also seems dead.\ngTasks is not the native iOS Reminders app although it will sync to Google Tasks. \nSince tasks from Google calendar do not sync to the iPhone (via Google Sync), I'd conclude that there's currently no way to bring iPhone Reminders app in sync with Google Tasks.\n", "Q: How do I delete specific photos from my photo-stream on the Mac or iPhone? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do you erase pictures from the Photo Stream album on an iPhone running iOS 5? \n\nAfter enabling the new photo-stream feature on my mac and iphone, I found that there does not seem to be a way to delete individual photos from the stream.  I like the convenience of having the photos automatically show up everywhere, but it would be nice to be able to weed out the bad ones.  I have the option to delete everything in the stream, but this was not what I was looking for.  So, is there a way on the Mac or iPhone to delete individual photos in the photo-stream?\n\nA: In recent (2017) versions of Photos.app, individual images can be selected and deleted from \"My Photo Stream\". These photos may also be removed from the local library on the device (depending on exactly how they were deleted: delete key; menu items; contextual menu; etc.), but not on other devices that have imported the images into their local library (which happens automatically with Photos.app on the Mac). Photos that were removed from the local library can be recovered from the \"Recently Deleted\" folder on the device, and are not added back to \"My Photo Stream\". Note that the photos visible in \"My Photo Stream\" can differ between different devices, perhaps due to time lag between local caches and server updates.\nIn earlier software## Heading ##, it seems that the only way to do this is to turn off Photo Stream, delete the photos from your devices, and turn Photo Stream back on.\nFrom the relevant Apple support page:\nTo Reset your Photo Stream, follow these instructions:\n\n*\n    \n*From a computer browser, go to icloud.com and sign in.\n    \n*Click on your name on the iCloud home page (this is the page that shows all the app icons). If you do not see your name, click the cloud icon in the top left of the page.\n    \n*Click Advanced.\n    \n*Here you will see the Reset Photo Stream button. Clicking this button will remove all your Photo Stream photos from iCloud. Once removed, they cannot be recovered, but you can re-upload any photos you'd like to restore to your Photo Stream from a Mac or PC.\n\nAfter resetting your Photo Stream, you can also remove any photos that have been downloaded to your device or computers. To do this, follow the directions below:\n\n*\n    \n*On your iOS device, you can remove photos from the Photo Stream view by turning off Photo Stream and then optionally turning it back on. You can do this at Settings > iCloud > Photo Stream.\n    If you added any Photo Stream photos to other albums or the Camera Roll on your iOS device, you can locate and delete these photos manually, if desired.\n    \n    \n*On your Mac, you can clear cached photos from the Photo Stream view in iPhoto or Aperture by turning off Photo Stream and then optionally turning it back on. You can do this in each application by visiting Preferences > Photo Stream.\n    If you had Automatic Import enabled in your Photo Stream settings, your Photo Stream photos were also imported to your iPhoto or Aperture Library, and will remain after you disable Photo Stream. If you would like to delete any of these photos from your library, you can to do so manually any time you like.\n    \n    \n*On your PC, you can remove Photo Stream photos by deleting them from your designated Photo Stream Download Folder. By default, this folder is located at C:\\Users\\Apple\\Pictures\\Photo Stream\\My Photo Stream.\n \n", "Q: How can I download my contacts with the latest LinkedIn application version? In the old (before version 4) LinkedIn application, there was a button to Download all connections to my iPhone.\nIn the latest (4.0.2) I cannot find that option.\nHow can I update (download) all my connections with the latest LinkedIn version?\n\nA: Considering that their mobile app page doesn't show the current version, and the current version doesn't have this feature anywhere that I could find, I'm going to say that they have removed this feature.\nTry using their feedback page to request this feature in v4.x, or an explanation as to why it was removed etc..\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone use so much \"other\" space after upgrade to iOS 5? After upgrading my iPhone, there is about 10 gigabytes assigned to Other that I don't remember seeing before.\n\nWhat could be causing this space to be filled?\n\nA: It may be leftover data from a failed upgrade/sync.  I noticed the same thing on my iPad, which then disappeared once I re-synced it.\n\nA: I installed the iExplorer, then went to iTunes_Controls Music folder and cleaned it all including subfolders. My \"other\" went from 2.9 GB to ZERO... before that I tried to clean Safari cache, clean trash folders in my emails, etc, and nothing worked. \n\nA: Here's what worked for me:\nI used PhoneView on my mac (not sure if there's an equivalent app for Windows) to archive and delete:\n\n\n*\n\n*Old (text) messages. All those videos take up a lot of space\n\n*Old Voicemails\n\n\nI deleted all of my voice recordings on the iPhone, then went into iTunes on my computer where they were saved, and went through and deleted all of the duplicates (2-5 duplicates per recording!)\nNothing else worked for me, including doing a restore. I went from >5GB of \"other\" stuff to 1.2 GB (Mostly voice memos)\n\nA: My ex-wife's other space was 6 GB, and she couldn't hardly do anything.  It became apparent that her gmail account was the culprit - lots of big media files.  \nI reclaimed space in her gmail account by running it through findbigmail.com.  It's a web app that places all the big gmail files in three folders varying by size.  This takes them away from the inbox and frees up the space that the iPhone uses for gmail.\nFindbigmail.com is a wonderful service, and I recommend them whole-heartedly.  They removed the big attachements in her email in a few minutes.  They say on their site they don't read the emails at all or scan them, so I felt safer.\nIt was then solved by erasing the iPhone after a backup.  To be clear, you must specify the erase all content-and-settings to remove all the bloat.  \nThen a quick restore brought up a fresh iPhone with 6 GB more of space, and she's happier!\n\nA: If it's jailbroken then Cydia and other JB AppStore apps may use it.\nSay for instance you have downloaded some App using Cydia and installed it. The installation-file (*.ipsw) stays in the filesystem. until you remove it.\n\nA: I had 6 GB of \"other\" and couldn't rid myself of it.  I finally realized that I send pictures all the time via text message.  I deleted my texts, and the \"other\" disappeared!!!\n\nA: I found that having the camera application in memory kept it from releasing the space when I deleted the videos and pictures after uploading them to iPhoto.  Quit all my apps and the Other shrunk from 7G to 0.7G\n\nA: I had the same problem and after multiple syncs, it still wouldn't resolve. I turned off all of my mail (I had my .mac and google email addresses on the phone) and synced again. That resolved the issue. \n\nA: I've seen this a few times, and something different seems to be the cause each time. You can fix it by syncing with iTunes, then disabling different types of data to be synced, syncing again, and checking to see if \"other\" goes down. If not, enable that data again and move on to the next.\nFor me, it was music, but I've seen books and podcasts and I think calendars do the same thing.\n\nA: For me, backup & restore fixed the issue. Had lost 13 GB, which went down to 1 GB after restore. \n\nA: Whenever I deleted my music from my iphone, it also cleared out a huge chunk of what was labeled as \"other\".  My usage went from 6.9 gigs to 2.9 gigs.  Still a lot for just \"other\"...but for whatever reason my music was only showing up as 1.6 gigs in iTunes, but when I looked under usage in the iphone settings...it said it was 5.6 gigs.  I have no idea what the deal is...but at least I got my \"other\" down to a smaller size.\nApple needs to get this fixed...\n\nA: I've pinpointed this to be mail related - specifically the time duration you're syncing mail. \nI use exchange for work mail and when I had 1 month of mail sync, \"other\" was at 5.5gb. I changed that to be 1 week sync and it dropped to .5 gb. Don't know if icloud or gmail are affected as well but it appears to be an issue with the default iphone email app.\nI've done multiple factory resets and restored to new phone condition but the above is the only consistent solution\n\nA: Go to Settings > Safari and clear history, cookies, and data.\n", "Q: Is there a human-readable summary of Apple's Terms and Conditions? Just went to update my apps on my iPhone and it looks like Apple have updated their Terms and Conditions and Apple Privacy Policy. It's currently at 62 pages!\nHas anyone read it thoroughly and can give a short summary of any important items for users? I appreciate this won't be a legal answer (that'll also take 62 pages) but a general summary would be handy, e.g. am I promising to go on their mailing list or something like that?\nClarification: the best answer won't be legally accurate (because only the T&C themselves are) but it will state if there are any gotchas or weird stuff users should be aware of.\n\nA: Apple has on their website the latest versions all of their legal documents on their website: http://www.apple.com/legal/. Some of those pages offer summaries of the policies, but not many of them have that.\nAt the same time @Mark makes a valid point: there is a reason why these legal documents are so long. If you want a summary, then it would be best to have a lawyer look it over and give you the information you need. I think any take away from their documentation is that Apple is very restrictive when it comes to their branding, content, technologies, processes, and the like.\n", "Q: What is the workflow between iWork apps with iCloud? I have Numbers and Pages for iOS and the Mac. With iOS 5, I can create documents and spreadsheets in iCloud. How can I access those same iCloud documents in the Mac versions? Even better yet, if I want to create a document in the Mac version, how can I save it in iCloud to begin with? \nI have upgraded to the latest OS X Lion version (10.7.2) and while I see the new iCloud preference pane un System Preferences and I have enabled Documents In The Cloud, I cannot see to find their counterparts in the Mac iWork apps. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks.\n\nA: There is no iCloud-enabled version of iWork '09 on the Mac as of yet. Right now the way to save to iCloud from the Mac iWork apps is through the website.\nEnabling iCloud for iWork for Mac is a bigger deal than I think most people realize. We've still yet to see any sort of UI for saving documents to iCloud on a Mac. So, for example, in iWork, will you see a standard \"iCloud\" folder in the Finder? Will you see a UI pane similar to the iOS versions of the apps? But in that case, how can you save a standard file to on your computer? Apple hasn't yet answered these questions, and I believe they are still working out some of these major details. \nAside from the UI issues, the Mac versions of iWork still have more advanced capabilities than the iOS versions. My guess, and hope, is that Apple will not enable cross-platform iCloud auto-saving until they are sure that changes will persist exactly across both platforms. \n\nA: iWork for Mac, at the time of writing of this post, has not been updated to work with iCloud.\nLast version on the App Store came out in July, 20th, and does not have iCloud integration.  \nMeanwhile, you can upload and download documents from this page, which is a web interface to iCloud. The process is described in this guide.\n\n", "Q: How can I relist an App in App Store Purchased list that was inadvertently deleted? I inadvertently deleted the wrong App from the list of purchased Apps in the Mac App store. I would like to get it back. How can this be done?\nI was able to to \"Re-Purchase\" for free, by searching for the App and clicking buy, but that did not re-add the App to my Purchased list.\n\nA: This works for both iTunes Apps and the App Store on the Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into your account via the App Store account link.\n\n*Look for iTunes in the Cloud\n\n*Click the View Hidden Purchases link.\n\n*Select Unhide next to the App you want back in the list.\n\n\nItems aren't deleted from the list, just merely hidden.\n\n\nA: Yes, when you \"Accept\" the item which you hid, it is very unclear how to restore the item to the app list.

I currently sync ~3000 photos from my PC onto my iPhone 3GS. These photos are split into folders on my PC and these folders show up in the Photos app on my iPhone. However, these photos don't show up under the \"Camera Roll\".\nThe iCloud Backups page states that iCloud backs up \"Photos and video in the Camera Roll\". \nhttp://www.apple.com/icloud/features/apps-books-backup.html\nI would like to make sure that all my photos get included in an iCloud backup - Is there any way to convert my synced folders so that all the pictures show up in my Camera Roll and the folders show up as regular Photo folders which I can add/delete on my iPhone?\nIf not, is it possible to get my existing sync'd photos included in iCloud backups?\n\nA: There is no supported way to do that, for two reasons:  the backup would grow huge, rapidly consuming iCloud space, and non-camera-roll photos are resized to display well on the iPhone while taking minimum space. As such, they're not the \"original\" photos any more. Backing them up would be a false sense of security.\nThe best solution is to back up the PC.  The My Pictures folder will get backed up with the rest of your PC data, and you'll have copies of the original, non-resizd images should disaster strike.\n\nA: There isn't anyway of moving all of the photos at once, but if you have one photo, you can click the edit button and a message saying \"Duplicate and Edit\" will show up at the bottom of the screen. If you click on that, the photo will automatically go to the camera roll. You can do like 100 a day and eventually you'll have all. Then, once your done you can un-sync them.\n\nA: Sync your images via iTunes (all of them). When the album gets copied, go inside, Click select, click select all. After that, click the share icon in the left bottom. Click duplicate there and your stuff will get stored in camera roll. From there, go to iTunes on your MAC/PC and un-check the Sync Photos option. And sync your iPhone. You're done.\nIOS 10.3.3\n\nA: It is possible to convert synced photos to camera roll.\nThe Apple Community post \"Syncing\" Photos from iTunes into Camera Roll shows how.\nNote that duplicating a large number of images will take a long time, I had something like 500 images and it took at least 10 minutes.\nThis method is the fastest way to do this that I know of. Note that creating an album out of your synced folder does not do the same thing as duplicating these pictures.\nEven when connecting to my phone from a computer with iTunes installed:\n\n*\n\n*I was not able to find a way to get access to the synced photo data in iTunes, and\n\n*Synced folders are not shown in the DCIM folder.\n\nFrom what I have read there are some third party programs that might be able to help with this as well, but I was looking for a builtin solution.\nProcess for \"duplicating\" a synced image folder to Camera Roll:\n\n*\n\n*Open the photos app and open the synced photo folder (it might be under the category \"From My Mac\").\n\n*In the top right corner, hit select\n\n*Select the images you want to \"convert\" to camera roll images (or use Select All in the upper left corner)\n\n*Hit the button that looks like a square with an up arrow coming out of it (in the lower left corner), a menu will show on the bottom of the phone\n\n*On the lower scroll bar, scroll over until you see a \"Duplicate\" button, if you press that your iPhone will copy the photo to your camera roll.\n\nPhotos that are transferred using this method are then treated as normal Camera Roll pictures.\nMoving synced images to a non-camera roll album\nIf you would prefer to put the images in an album other than Camera Roll when duplicating them, you can add your synced folder's images to a new album and then duplicate them; all of the duplicated images will be placed in that album instead of being put in Camera Roll.\nTo do this, select all of your synced images (Select -> Select All), then click \"Add To\" and you can then add them to an existing album or a new album.\nThen, duplicate all of these images using the same steps shown above for the Camera Roll.\nAfter this process is done,\n\n*\n\n*You will now be able to connect your phone to your computer and copy the pictures out of the DCIM folder (which is what I did) without having to worry about losing any previously synced folders that you don't have access to anymore.\n\n*You will be able to delete these photos without doing a sync\n\nI did this on iOS 12, in case this behavior changes on later versions of iOS.\n\nA: Photos in the Camera Roll is backed up to Photostream and deleted after a month. You can't add photos back to the Camera Roll as far as I am aware.\nAll other photos are transferred using the normal sync via iTunes and not backed up to iCloud at all. The best suggestion I have for the amount of photos your dealing with is to use either iPhoto or Aperture to manage them and sync them the way you currently are. Use something like Time Capsule to back your machine up.\n\nA: Well, there's not really a way to do that. \nBut I have an idea that might just work! Redo that! Sync your photos not on the Camera Roll, normally. Then, when you download them, screenshot (press both buttons on your iPhone at the same time) in the clear image you want. \nThe image will be saved in your Camera Roll. Delete some other pics if it takes much space, but if you take a clear shot, the photo will be like any other, only saved on your Camera Roll. Then, unsync your photos. \n\nA: send pics from your mac to iPhone using airdrop it will save in camera roll.\n", "Q: Is the font in Messages.app changed in iOS5? The fonts in the Messages app look much better in iOS5 than in iOS4, and wanted to confirm it. I couldn't find any discussion or note about this online. I don't have a phone running iOS4 around to compare myself.\nHas it really changed? Any sources?\n\nA: Same font, but Apple added a very subtle text-shadow and tweaked the bubble reflection. That's the difference.\niOS 4\n\niOS 5\n\n", "Q: Why do empty \"Icon\\r\" or \"Icon^M\" files appear in directories? There's an empty file called Icon^M occasionally in my directories. I guess this stuff predates OSX, and it's a file that gets created by the finder to be backward compatible with OS 9. Yet, this is my guess. I tried to google, but given the name, I had some trouble finding something meaningful (in the sense that it explain what the file is and where it comes from, historically).\nIf you have any reference at hand I would enjoy learning this bit of lore.\n\nA: Do you have by any chance a custom icon you set up for that folder?\nI believe this is what this file is there for.\n\nThis Super User answer has the answer.\n", "Q: Time Machine: \"Enter Time Machine\" menu command does not do anything I have Time Machine running on an external hard drive and it reports happily that it is doing backups and I have no reason to doubt it.\nBut when I try to look at the backups by clicking \"Enter Time Machine\" nothing at all happens. No noises from the disk as far as I can tell. Nothing. And when I locate the \"Time Machine\" app in the Applications folder and run that, again, nothing happens...\nDo you have any idea what is up or what I need to do?\n\nA: By the way, I solved this:\nTHe external drive contained an existing backup to the same computer called *.sparsebundle. Those are only made when a drive is being accessed by Time Machine over the network. It was there from before I moved it to attach directly through USB.\nTM was able to access that sparse bundle without errors and update the backups there which is why my backups were running correctly.\nHowever for whatever reason, when I try to enter TM to see the backups it did \"nothing\". No messages, windows, or errors of any kind, including in the system logs.\nThe solution was to delete that sparse bundle and do a new backup with the drive directly connected via USB. This created a folder called *.backudb as expected, and now I can do backups there and I can see the backups by entering time machine (taking me to the time travel window.)\nOuch. I say the fact that this happened without any error message is a time machine bug although probably not many people hit it. At least give an error, but better, just work with the .sparsebundle, why not?\nRemark: you can still access the backup data by opening the backup via the Finder. This doesn't give you the fancy star spangled background, but you can at least access your files.\n\nA: I had a similar issue where Timemachine backups were getting done successfully on my networkdrive, but \"Enter Time Machine\" was not working.\nAfter several backups deleted, what finally worked was to install all pending Software Updates and it worked!!\n\nA: A better workaround than pitosalas's answer of creating new backups is to use a symlink in the existing sparsebundle.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the USB Drive\n\n*Mount the Time Machine Sparsebundle by\nclicking on it or using diskutil\n\n*cd /Volumes/USBDrive/\n\n*ln -s ../TimeMachineSparseBundleDrive/Backups.backupdb\nVoila! It requires you to manually mount the sparsebundle disk each time before using GUI Time Machine, but it works.\n\nA: I had this very same problem, but it transpired to be an access permissions issue.\nSituation:\nTimemachine backups to a ReadyNAS Duo connected to the router.\nSystem backing up without any problems.\nOnly one user account (admin).\nClicked on 'Enter Time Machine' or the Time Machine App logo to view the backups content and nothing happened (exactly the same as initial problem stated above).\nI could see the a HardDisk image on the desktop called \"Time Machine Backups\" - contained only one folder \"backups.backupdb\" (nothing referring to 'sparsebundle'). Inside the backup folder was a single folder with the namce of the (only) user account.\nThis had a 'no entry' symbol.\nSolution:\nRH click on folder with no entry symbol. Get Info. Sharing and Permissions (at the bottom). Click padlock to edit. Plus symbol - add the User account. Change privilege to 'Read & Write'.\nDONE.\nAfter this, 'Enter Time Machine' opened the TM visualiser as normal. Panic over.\n\nA: I just had the same issue in 10.11 El Capitan: \"Enter Time Machine\" did nothing, and nothing relevant showed in Console.app.\nI relaunched Finder (Apple menu > Force Quit > scroll to Finder and choose Relaunch) and the issue was then resolved.\nThis surprised me, given that the relevant app is /Applications/Time Machine.app, not Finder.  But it seems likely that Finder is actually responsible for the Time Machine display of the historic files: if I \"Enter Time Machine\", then check with ps or Activity Monitor via remote log in, I see no Time Machine process.  So perhaps /Applications/Time Machine.app simply tells Finder to start the display, then exits.\n\nA: I was having the exact same problem in Capitan as well.  My screen would try and go to time machine but would give up and revert to the original screen.  Found a hint on another forum and apparently, it could be related to a dual screen.  When I unplugged my Thunderbolt display and tried it from my laptop alone, it worked fine.  Hope that helps some of the people!\n\nA: AJ Slater's answer did it for me.  Mine is a kind of strange setup of an NTFS external drive with a sparsebundle image.  In this case I had to open the sparsebundle image and link to the .backupdb directory like this:\ncd /Volumens/NTFS_EXT_DISK\nln -s /Volumes/TM-backup-of-javiers-MacBook-Air/Backups.backupdb .\n\nThe TM-backup-of-javiers-MacBook-Air is the sparsebundle that is on the root directory of my NTFS drive and that I had to previously mount in order to do the linking.\nAfter that I entered the precious star field of TimeMachine.\n\nA: Just for the completeness seck , I would like to add this answer here. \nI had a 500GB 2nd generation TC and i recently upgraded to 4th Gen 2TB TC . \nCoincidentally i gave exactly same name to new capsule along with its new Hard drive as that of the older one. Then( i mistakenly ) added their passwords to my keychain.. VIOLA.. \nI had intermittently been able to either back up and get into time machine mode. Some times it used to get stuck in the while trying to find a backup drive.\nI fixed it with : \n\n\n*\n\n*first removing all the entries form my keychain.\n\n*Re-selecting the backup drive from time machine preferences. \n\n*Re-adding the \"remote Drive mouting\" from my Preferences->Users & Groups -> Login Items\n\n\nA: I found that simply turning off Time Machine in System Preferences and then turning it back on again worked.  :-)\n\nA: I tried the easiest thing first to solve this problem successfully, following one post above and proceeding as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Apple Preferences.\n\n*Open Time Machine.\n\n*Enter pass code to be able to uncheck \"backup automatically\" and \"show Time Machine in menu bar\"\n\n*Reboot machine.\n\n*Go back to the Apple Preference and recheck the items previously unchecked.\n\n\nAt this point, the Time Machine icon on the bottom toolbar began to work for entering Time Machine to access backups. \n\nA: I saw a comment saying that multiple monitors prevented TimeMachine from launching.  I was using VNC to remote into the computer, and it was apparently preventing it.  Which is odd, but I swear I've used Apple Remote Desktop in the past with TimeMachine.  Anyhow, I went to the computer locally, and TimeMachine worked fine.\n\nA: Nothing here worked for me, but I tried killing timed, and suddenly \"Enter Time Machine\" from the menu worked.\nI actually did it using Alfred and an extension, but you can do it using Terminal.app or iTerm2.app, and typing\npkill timed\n\n\nA: You should enable local storage by Time Machine. Just run the following command in Terminal:\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\n\n", "Q: Playing audio books on iOS 5 As the new Music application in iOS 5 seems to have an extremely broken behavior for some audiobooks, I am looking for alternatives.\nI have several audio books that have a series of many MP3 files, one for each chapter (e.g http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455826235/).  In iTunes I had all files for these audio books set to have the 'Audiobook' kind.\nIt seems like the new behavior for the Music application is to play the current selected track until the finish, and then stop playing, it does not continue on to the next track like on a music album.\nI do not want to revert back to an earlier version of iOS, and I would like to avoid having to change all my audiobooks to be seen by iTunes as music, but how can I listen to my audiobooks?\nI have also tried playing the audio books through the Audible app, and through Bookmark.  But neither of them show that I have any audiobooks on my device, but I am certain I have them, since I can play them in the music app, one chapter at a time.  I was able to see them and play them using those apps before I upgraded to iOS 5.\nIs there any fixes for this? Is there any external apps that can actually play audiobooks syced from iTunes in iOS 5.\n\nA: The Audible app will play any audiobooks in your iTunes (now Music) library on your iPhone. To make this work, select the \"My Library\" menu item and then click the button for the \"iPod Library\". Clicking either \"iPod Library\" or \"Audiobooks\" will then show all of the books in your library, including non-Audible.com books...i.e. books synced from iTunes. \n\nA: I have the same problem with audio books. But there is a workaround until Apple hopefully fixes this problem:\nCreate a play-list and add the entire audio book to the play-list. Then it can play the chapters continuously. \nIf this doesn't address the issue there is another method that does work:\nWhen an Audiobook firstly copied to iTunes library and after that either dragged to iPhone / iPod or synched it can resume from the last stop when you return to your audiobook after playing other files.\nHowever, there is one limitation - your Audiobook MUST have chapters. If it is one large  not chapter-divided M4B file the \"Music\" app can't remember the last stop.\nThere is a PC program to make chapters for audiobooks called Chapter Master\n", "Q: Can I make the Launchpad key (F4) on my new Macbook Pro toggle Mission Control instead? I will never use Launchpad, however I really like Mission Control. I'd love to disable the Launchpad feature and make my F4 key toggle Mission Control instead. F3 does that already, however I'd like to have both keys assigned to that feature.\n\nA: What you want is FunctionFlip:\n\nYou can individually choose which keys you want as standard f-keys and which you want as the Mac-specific functions. In your case, \"flip\" the F4/Launchpad key, then assign F4 to launch Mission Control.\nThe only caveat is you cannot use both FunctionFlip and BetterTouchTool, as the developer of BTT points out.\n\nA: Simple answer: Not really.\nYou can, however, enable the \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" option in the Keyboard preference pane:\n\n... and then use BetterTouchTool to map F4 to Expose.\n\nBy doing this, all functions of your current function keys won't work and you'll have to remap all of them using BTT as you like.\n\nA: A tool very similar to FunctionFlip is Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook). You can use it together with BetterTouchTool.

Is there some hidden setting or string I can change (e.g. using terminal)?\n\nA: I tried replacing the \"dock\" folder in System > core services with that one from 10.7.1, it actually made launchpad icons smaller again, but at every start up it takes some time to load the dock an the desktop background, and the dock is not working properly, I'm trying to figure it out changing something in the dock folder instead of replacing it whole.\n\nA: According to OS X Daily, if you replace the 10.7.2 Dock binary with the 10.7.1 dock binary, the icons will resume their diminutive size.\n", "Q: How to get a mac to wait longer for external disk to wake up upon resuming from sleep? My Mac has an external disk attached, and I often get \"disk not ejected properly\" warnings after resuming the computer from sleep. These warnings appear only when the disk has spun down during the sleep, and it seems that they are related to how long OS X is willing to wait for a device to become present before declaring it disconnected after resuming from sleep.\nIt would be nice to not get the annoying pop-up upon resuming from sleep, and the messages about journal replay in kernel.log look slightly alarming, even though it is unlikely that anything wouldn't have gotten written to disk while the computer was idle before going to sleep. Can this wait time be increased somehow?\n\nA: There are various google results for ejecting volumes on sleep, which should solve this problem.\nFirst, write yourself a shell script to eject the volume.  You could avoid setuid bits by using apple script.\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\ntell application \"Finder\" to eject (disks where name = \"VOLUME\")\n\nNext, install the SleepWatcher tool and configure ~/.sleep or /etc/rc.sleep appropriately.\nThere are similar directions for remounting the disk on wake in that Mac OS X Hints entry, but maybe you don't need that.\n\nA: You can try autoeject or jettyson. They should both serve your purpose.\n\nA: Have you tried this:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/autodiskmount AutomountDisksWithoutUserLogin -bool true\n\nThis should stop the disk demounting when you log out, whether or not it also works for sleep I don't know (and cannot test right now).\n", "Q: Recreating iTunes .itl database from .xml file without itunes copying songs? I have a Library.xml file, and want have its contents in iTunes.  If I follow the recommended \"File -> Library -> Import Playlist\" option for this, it tries to copy all my songs into the iTunes Media folder, probably because my Library.xml file references all its songs on a networked drive.\n\nA: Turns out that the one step I was forgetting was to reset the iTunes settings after removing my .itl database and library .xml files so that iTunes did not \"organize your library\" and \"copy songs to itunes media folder after adding to library\".\n", "Q: Why do I have an \"iMessage\" and an \"SMS\" thread for my contact? I recently updated to iOS5, One of my friends messaged me through iMessage, the sender name was his @gmail.com address.\nThe message appeared in a seperated thread to the existing SMS messages I had with him previously.\nI added his mail address to the contact I already had with him, however I cannot get the iMessage thread to merge with the SMS thread.\nI have tried deleting the iMessage thread with no result.\nIf I open the SMS thread, it will only send SMS.\nIf I open the iMessage thread, it will only send iMessages.\nIs there a solution to let me merge these two conversations?\nPhone is an iPhone 4G 16GB.\n\nA: iMessage threading is a total mess. I have an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2, both with iOS5. So does my brother. Not including regular SMS messages sent/received with iOS4, I now have three different threads of messages from him on my iPhone, seemingly depending on which device the message was sent/received on. I have two on the iPad, but these don't correspond exactly to any two from the iPhone.\nI understand that iMessage (like FaceTime) can only address contacts by email address on a WiFi-only iPad, and can address by both email and phone number from an iPhone, but these all resolve to the same Apple ID on the server, and to the same contact on the device. Surely it should be possible to merge these conversations, either on the server (by Apple ID) or on the device (by contact).\nPerhaps a fix will appear in a future iOS update but for now this rather takes the edge off an otherwise cool new feature.\n\nA: I can imagine this might happen if he doesn't have an iPhone but does have an iPod Touch or an iPad.  \nSo when you send him an SMS it goes to his non-Apple phone (or non-iOS5 Apple phone) and when you send him an iMessage he receives it on an iPad or iPod Touch which is running iOS5\niMessage is associated with an Apple ID.  So if your friend has several iOS5 devices, his iMessages from you will be received on each device, however regular SMS will only go to his phone.  If his phone is running a version of iOS preceding iOS5 (or isn't an iPhone) he won't receive iMessages on it and the threads will never merge on your phone because they're sent on two separate devices by your friend.\n\nA: My girlfried had a similar issue, when I checked the iMessage settings page the 'receive as' setting showed an error for her number and was defaulting to her gmail (I assume this occurred when the gmail address was added when she used facetime on her iMac). I simply turned iMessage off and back on again and it seems to have resolved the problem. \n\nA: I had this exact problem. I would attempt to iMessage someone and he got my iMessages just fine in our usual text thread. But when he would iMessage me back, I would get them in a brand new, separate thread. Finally what I did was just DELETE his email from my Contacts that was associated with his new iMessage thread, and viola. All of his messages, texts and otherwise, came to his old thread from then on.\nI haven't re-added his email yet.. I'm frankly a little nervous to do so. Hope this helps.\n\nA: An iPhone keeps a record of the phone number of the SIM card inside it. However it isn't very reliable. Things like changing your phone number but keeping the same SIM can mess it up - for example when you get a new contract and SIM but then get your old phone number pOrted across. \nFaceTime and iMessage both use this record of your phone number. You can check the number by:\n- opening the Phone app\n- clicking the Contact tab at the bottom\n- scrolling UP the list of contacts (not DOWN)\n- it'll reveal a line of text that says \"My Number:\" and shows the phone number the iPhone THINKS you have. \nIf the iPhone has the wrong number you can fix it by turning both iMessage and FaceTime off at the same time in Settings and them turning them both on. The My Number should then magically update with the correct number. \n", "Q: MacBook Air (mid 2011) running OS X 10.7.2 won't stay asleep I'm running OS X 10.7.2 on a MacBook Air (mid-2011).

We're a college campus that has an iPod Touch program... all new full time students get an iPod when they first arrive on campus. We also have a number of faculty using iPads.\nTo help take better advantage of these devices, we are about to connect AppleTVs to a number of the projectors in different classrooms... 18 in all. These classrooms also have Windows PCs (mostly XP, but some 7) connected to the projectors.  \nWhat I want to do is install iTunes on each classroom computer, and set iTunes to connect to the AppleTV in that classroom (and only the AppleTV in the classroom). I want it to ignore the AppleTVs from other classrooms.  All the classrooms are on the same subnet.  The idea is that when different faculty members or students log in to the computer with their own profiles, that iTunes profile will automatically see the right AppleTV, and no one will accidentally connect to an AppleTV in a different classroom.\nSo far, the only way I can see to do this is let the computers connect to any AppleTV they see, and then put each classroom on an individual subnet (a huge pain in the you know what).  Are there any other ideas? I'm okay with hand editing a config file somewhere, if need be.\nNever mind that the computer is already connected directly to the projector, and therefore should never need to rely on the AppleTV to show anything in iTunes. If someone tries to use iTunes to control the AppleTV, it should work.\n\nA: I would suggest, assuming the main function you'll be using is AirPlay, that you give each classroom's Apple TV its own AirPlay password that only the instructor in that room knows. That way, he/she can connect to it with the credentials you've given and no one else can. If a student needs to connect to it to show something, the instructor could put in the password on the student's laptop. Obviously, if the password gets leaked you can change it at will.\nI know this seems a little tedious, but I think it's the only way of doing it short of re-subnetting the building (I understand why you'd want to NOT do that!).\nAlso, I would suggest you create DHCP reservations for each Apple TV on your DHCP server so they always get the same IP address when connecting, just in case your network gets overloaded. Just a suggestion.\nHope this helps a little. Good luck.\n", "Q: What would be the best way to use iCloud to upload photos to Facebook/Google+? I'd like to use iCloud in a manner similar to what Android users get with Google+. I'd like to take a picture with my iPhone, and have it automatically uploaded to (and thus permanently stored on) either Facebook or Google+ without having to do anything about it.\nAt present, it seems to me that the way to do this would be to sync my iPhone and a server with iCloud, and have some service (one that I'll write if I have to or one that is hopefully available or planned) running on the server that monitors the photo directory for new photos, and then uploads them via a Facebook or Google API.\nDoes this sound like the simplest way to get the sort of snap and forget photo functionality that I desire?\n\nA: That won't be possible. iCloud is not a sharing/hosting service (at least concerning photos). It is a syncing service. And photos aren't stored for more than 30 days.\nAnd only Apple devices can connect to the iCloud service/servers. There is no general API.\nTo get what you want, you'd have to write an app that does this and miss out iCloud completely. \n\nA: There's actually a free service specifically for this kind of thing, it's called If This Then That (ifttt.com). You can configure all different types of cloud and other services with it, and then use pre-configured \"recipes\" or create our own. You can create all kinds of cool automated actions with it that will save you lots of time. I personally have it back up all my iOS photos to Dropbox and also copy them to my Flickr page but you can easily set it up to post to a Facebook album instead (I use it the other way, I have it copy any photos I'm tagged in to my iCloud photos). I also have it copy a link to my FB posts to my Twitter feed, and use it with my Amazon Echo to turn on lights, etc. \n", "Q: After updating to iOS5, Safari will not run on jailbroken iPhone 4 Clicking Safari brings up the launch screen for Safari and then it immediately quits. Double clicking the Home button shows Safari is still running.  Quitting it and restarting does not help.  Quitting and restarting phone does not help.\n\nA: It's because I jail broke the device with a tethered jailbreak. A tethered jailbreak requires you to use the jailbreak software (viz., Redsn0w) to boot the device (the option \"just boot tethered\") whenever it is turned off (hence \"tethered\").\nIf I don't boot the phone with the jailbreak software, Safari doesn't work (along with some other default applications). All my fault.\n", "Q: How set up a local domain such as local.test? I'm web-developer and I need local domains. Before 10.7.2 update, I'm just fix /etc/hosts as I need, but new update crash this solution.

Like so:\n127.0.0.1 LLL.localhost\n127.0.0.1 LLL.localhost\n#\n\nAlthough you probably can't tell, there is another line following the # symbol.

I am a happy @gmail.com user and do not plan to switch to @me.com in the foreseeable future, still I do have a Mac and an iPhone and I do want to keep all my info in sync.\nSo far I used the Gmail Exchange setup (m.google.com method) because this allowed me to sync calendar and email.\nWhat is the best way to use Gmail contacts and calendar with Apple OS X and iOS? \nAs I do have an active iCloud account, does it bring any new functionality for a gmail user?\nHow can I sync tasks and notes from Gmail with iOS?\n\nA: Using iCloud doesn't really add new features for a Gmail user.\nContacts\nContacts on iOS are perfectly synced when using Google via Exchange.\nContacts on Mac OS X are synced using Address Book \"Sync with Google\" feature.\nCalendar\nCalendar is a bit more tricky.\nOn iOS, you have to activate each calendar individually in http://m.google.com/sync. But then, it syncs perfectly.\nOn Mac OS X, it can also be added to iCal, except it's via \"Delegates\".\nIt works but doesn't feel as just work as iCould does.\nMail\nMail has it's quirks, too.\nOn iOS, via Exchange, it doesn't bring all the Gmail goodness (archiving, etc.). And it miss push via the Gmail template.\nOn Mac OS X, via Mail, it's the same, archiving puts the mail in an \"Archive\" folder instead of the \"All Mails\" one.\nUsing an app like Sparrow resolve this issue.\n\nTo conclude, iCloud, like using the iWork suite instead of say Office, doesn't add value, but it feels more integrated with the OS (whether it's Mac OS or iOS).\n", "Q: How to completely disable auto-save and versions in Mac OS X Lion? I hate the automatic saving and versioning in Mac OS X Lion.\nIs there a way to completely turn it off?\n(This has been asked before here, but the answer and the linked article are completely wrong, so I thought I'd try again.)\n\nA: There is a much much simpler way to do it that was only introduced in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.\nAccording to this post, you just have to enable System Preferences > General > Ask to keep changes when closing documents.\n\n\nA: I agree, too many assumptions on Apple's side what users need and especially what can be controlled by the user → hint: new full-screen apps on dual-/multi-monitor setups (fail)  \nFor Versions it's quite similar, no control for the user :(\nThe only thing I found so far is checking the size of the Versions folder /.DocumentRevisions-V100 and deleting it if I think it takes up too much space.  \nNote: This is a very bad idea ! It will delete all your previous versions of doucuments/files\nsudo rm -rf /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nYou could then prevent the re-creation of that directory by  \nsudo touch /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nBut that creates a big mess, leaving you unable to re-save documents in Apps featuring \"Versions & Autosave\"  \nNot a satisfying solution. I really hope someone finds a way to turn it off or that one of the next OS X updates gives the user more control.\nHackinations: 5 really good Lion tweaks mentions that the switch NSDocumentAutosaveOldDocumentDayThreshold could be used to tweak autosave but I couldn't find any details about its function. \nAnd it seems the deamon\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/GenerationalStorage.framework/Versions/A/Support/revisiond is responsible for creating the versions - if you rename or move it and restart, \"Versions\" no longer functions but this is a bad idea again as all processes that depend on that deamon run into serious troubles.  \nAnyone with better ideas ?\n\nA: I intentionally was searcing for hidden defaults1 and fortuitously stumbled across a defaults setting that disables Auto Save, Versions and Resume, all at once. \nIf you have a tolerance for potentially breaking things (joke), try the following Terminal command (for Preview in this example):\ndefaults write -app 'preview' ApplePersistence -bool no\n\nReplace preview with the name of whatever app you wish to perform this on.\nAlternatively, you can configure this globally with this command (but beware that this causes slow logins, so not recommended):\ndefaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool no\n\nI can confirm that this works for TextEdit, Preview, Automator and Safari (for disabling Resume), but it should also work for other Apple applications like iWork, Xcode, iPhoto etc. It also works for some, but not all, third party applications. My machine hasn't gone up in flames (joking again) but as long as you have a good backup system, these settings seem stable to change and test. \nFor TextEdit, you must additionally run the following command, in order to avoid sandbox errors:\ndefaults write -app textedit AutosavingDelay -int 0\n\n[This effectively disables the old-style, pre-Lion autosaving completely, so the sandbox won't complain anymore about TextEdit trying to automatically save stuff without your \"consent\".]\nAnother option, is a TextEdit fork called \"TextEdit+\", that thankfully isn't sandboxed (surprisingly, TextEdit is actually open source). It can be downloaded here.\nDisabling ApplePersistence also restores Save As in most apps, except in Preview, iWork and maybe some others. In those cases you can use the Export… menu item instead. This is almost identical to Save As, except that you have to manually open the document after saving it. Just assign Command-Shift-S to Export… in these applications, and you'll get something very similar to Save As there too.\nTo restore normal behaviour, run:\ndefaults delete -app 'preview' ApplePersistence\n\ndefaults delete -g ApplePersistence\n\ndefaults delete -app textedit AutosavingDelay\n\n\n1 Thanks to Lri for his excellent one-liner for finding hidden defaults settings. \n\nA: I found a way to disable Versions (not Autosave) in a (hopefully) non-destructive reversible way: (re)move the SQLite database that Versions uses\nCareful, this comes with absolutely no warranty and may break your system!\nsudo mv /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1 /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1_off; sudo touch /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo killall revisiond\nIf it worked you'll be notified e.g. in Textedit when you close a document:\n\nThat (probably) means that your document will still be automatically saved in certain intervals, but once you close it (or the program) you can only retrieve the latest version (and Time Machine backups, if available).\nThe changes can be undone with sudo rm /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo mv /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1_off /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo killall revisiond\n\nEdit 2012-04-04:\nVersions (especially of Autosave) may still end up in ~/Library/Containers as nicely described in this answer.\n\nA: Happily, I didn't have to resort to this. I studied all other safe measures and after trying out some clean disk apps OnyX did the work.\nThis application requires full system admin privileges to install, and will essentially run the commands mentioned in some of the other answers automatically for you.

I know I can go to the Maps app, and then click on the pin for my current location, and then select to share it, and then pick to send a message (vs. an email etc.)\nBut I can't find any way to send my location from the messages app, the way I might send a photo.\nWhich is silly - how often are you hanging around in the maps app when you want to tell someone where you are?   It makes sense when you're sending a location where you aren't, say the restaurant you'll meet at tomorrow, but you'd think a solid percentage of shared locations are \"here's where I am\", and in almost all of those cases, you're starting in the message app, not the map.   \nA I missing anything?\n\nA: Edit: Sorry, I skimmed a bit and missed that you figured this part out already. I don't believe it can be done directly from the Messages app. In conceptual terms, the iOS model for data sharing is typically such that you send data from an app, but the \"sending apps\" generally can't grab data from elsewhere. This is true for most things except photos, i.e. you can send a contact from the Contacts app, but you can't directly attach one from the Messages app.\n\nOriginal post:\nYou can do this by tapping the blue arrow (blue i on an iPad) on any location (dropped pin, current location), and tapping Share Location. It will give you the option of sending via email, Message or Tweet. Your recipient will get sent a contact with a maps url and address.\n\nA: MultiTask to maps - drop your pin, share back to SMS/email. \nI suppose some twitter apps will let you geotag a post, but there's no way to pin an arbitrary SMS or email other than starting from Maps.\n\nA: For iOS 8 or later, in iMessage once you have your conversation with the contact(s) you wish to send your location with, tap \"Details\" and then tap \"Send Location\".\n\nA: You can search for a location and when the red pin is on the map you can click it and choose to share location.

Example: A commute planer app could take a start and destination from you, through Siri, and plan your trip.

That may or may not be changed in the future; see e.g. http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/iphone_4s for discussion.\n\nA: As Victor mentioned, there is currently no API which allows an app to be accessed using the Siri interface. However, the speech-to-text portion of Siri is available automatically. Any app which displays the standard keyboard will have a microphone icon which allows you to speak, and Siri will transcribe that to fill in the field for you.

However, it told me I had to create a new @me.com email address in the iCloud setup tool so I did (abc@me.com).\nThe thing is, my preferred Apple ID is actually different (abc@gmail.com), that's the Apple ID I've been buying iTunes music with for years, so I want to keep using it for iCloud too.  \nSo I logged out of iCloud, and logged in with the \"correct\" Apple ID abc@gmail.com\nThen I went to configure Mail for iCloud to use my newly created abc@me.com, but it's prompting me to create a \"new\" @me.com email.  It won't let me use the abc@me.com that I just created under the abc@mac.om Apple ID. :( \nSince I already have and like abc@me.com, I want to use that one, but it won't let me.  It insists on creating a new @me.com\nIs there any way to associate the newly created abc@me.com email address with a different Apple ID than the one I created it with?  Or am I stuck creating yet another @me.com email address?\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you would like to change the primary email address associated with your apple id, this is not only possible but fairly easy to do if you have the right site. \nClick \"Manage your account\" about halfway down http://appleid.apple.com and you should be presented with an option to edit \"Apple ID and Primary Email Address\".\n\nA: I changed the email of my iTunes account and then logged into iCloud with a different Apple ID with the email address I wanted to use.\n\nA: There appears to be no way to do what I need.\n", "Q: How can I change Finder's default sort to filename? Since I updated to Lion, every time I bring up a new Finder window the default sort order is by modification date. I want the default sort by filename.

All six people have iPhones, and they have all recently asked me about syncing. I told them to wait until iCloud came out so I could give them a more informed answer.\nI know that once you have iOS 5 on your phones, you can have separate iCloud accounts while sharing an iTunes Store account between you. That is not my question.\nBut to get iOS 5 on your phone, you have to plug it in and sync it with iTunes one last time. I can't test this, but I'm assuming that unless you create separate Windows or OS X accounts for that one lousy sync, you can't do it without screwing up at least one person's data.\nThat is my question: Is there a good way to install iOS 5 on two iPhones, from one computer account, without causing the data apocalypse you're trying to avoid by upgrading to iOS 5 in the first place?\nEDIT: It occurs to me that after I plug in the phone, I could just uncheck every single \"Sync\" option underneath the tabs on the device screen in iTunes. Is that all it would take to upgrade to iOS 5 but leave the device untouched?\n\nA: You don't mention if they're on the same computer. I am in a similar situation, two iPhones on one iTunes account, except we each sync to a different computer. I expect (based on the note above) to be able to upgrade both two iOS 5 and use two different iCloud accounts. As our data currently lives separately on two computers (Snow Leopard), I'm optimistic that we won't clobber one another. Perhaps this is an option for your friends?\n\nA: see http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=526655  a better start than the above.  \nOne option might be to have one phone synced with the address book...then do an address book export...sync up the other phone, and see if it merges...if not, then you can import the other addresses.  \nI'd agree with your caution...be careful, but I think there's a way to figure it out...start with the link above and the address book backup...hope it helps.\n\nA: Since iTunes will make a backup and then restore the data onto the devices, why not transfer all the purchase to the computer and let iTunes do the install as designed?\nMaking a second OS users account isn't that hard if someone is adamant that their apps can't live with another's purchased apps...\n", "Q: Why is iOS 5 draining my battery so fast? My wife's phone went from lasting a full day to needing a recharge every few hours after upgrading to iOS 5.   Mine still works fine after the upgrade.  What might be causing this?\n\nA: After upgrading to iOS 5 I noticed a huge battery loss compared to normal (10% per hour) and my iPhone was regularly warm to the touch.   The steps that resolved this issue for me were resetting all network settings (this restarted the iPhone) and then erasing all email accounts, including iCloud, and manually re-adding them.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAfter performing these steps my phone immediately cooled off and the battery was stable once again.  Your mileage may vary.\n\nA: To fix the battery drain issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Location services > System services\nEverything should be OFF in there.\nAlso limit apps location service for those which you do not use frequently.\n\n*Notifications, disable those you do not use.\n\n*iCloud, set to sync manually now and then over WiFi.\n\n*Disable Ping\nGo to Settings > General > Restrictions\nEnter 4 digit pass code.\nScroll down to Ping settings and disable it.\n\nA: As for the technical why of iOS5 draining your battery much faster than the previous OS, this Fastmail blog article might give some specific clues (Fastmail is an email provider, and the issue described applies to the IMAP email protocol, but it might be hinting about a more general change in iOS):\n\nUnfortunately, there’s a new and recent problem that has now appeared.\niOS 5 now uses long lived persistent IMAP connections (apparently\n  previous versions only used short lived connections). The problem is\n  that our ping packets every 4 minutes mean that the device\n  (iPhone/iPad/iPod) is \"woken up\" every 4 minutes as well. This means\n  the device never goes into a deeper sleep mode, which causes\n  significantly more battery drain when you setup a connection to the\n  Fastmail IMAP server on iOS 5 devices.\nGiven the rapid increase in use of mobile devices like iPhones, and\n  the big difference in battery life it can apparently cause, this is a\n  significant issue.\n\n\nA: The question has been mostly covered, but I'll also point out that iOS5 will eat your battery a bit more than previous versions, there's plenty going on in the background with the iCloud sync, Photostream et al.\nThe ones that haven't been touched on that really helped my battery life over the betas are these:\n1) Find my iPhone occasionally will ping and not fully shutdown location services and take a bit more running.\n2) Heavy heavy games and apps won't always dump out of memory, this is mostly sorted now (mostly), and can cause a bit of a battery eating situation. If you've been playing a game and your phone is still warm manually kill it.\n3)Photostream seems to run quite a lot, disable it if you don't really need it. Your photos still get backed up to iCloud.\n4) Disable the weather and stock widgets \nThose helped me get it back from half a day if I was lucky to a full day. There's a few that are a bit killing a chicken to appease the gods (looking at you number 4), but still worth ticking off if you want max battery life.\n\nA: Did you perchance set up a geofence? It keeps the location services on, it might explain the draining.\n\nA: Do you guy's have foursquare running? If so, turn off that new feature called \"Radar\". It's constantly running in the background that's why Location is ALWAYS active even if you kill the app\n\nA: I think I've found the answer for my case. Location services were completely innocent, and I've returned them to default settings. My phone synchronises with a Zimbra server, set up as an Exchange account. The update enabled sync of Reminders, but the Reminder sync didn't work. Removing Reminder sync from the Exchange account setup has stopped the battery level dropping while I watch.\nMy general advice is to check your mail accounts to see if anything new is being synchronised, and then disable it if you're not using it.\nEdit: added image showing Reminders control.\n\n\nA: This is quite a general question, and you should compare how your wife and you use the iPhone to find out what was/were draining your wife's iPhone battery.\nYou may need to check whether your wife was using iPhone more frequently than before, or she was using some app consumes more power i.e. games, or streaming movies from Netflix etc. \nAlso, the location service really drains battery, so make sure to check whether some app is using the location service all the time. \n\nA: Go to location services-> choose System Services-> and switch Setting Time Zone off\n\nA: Taken from here : http://osxdaily.com/2011/10/16/ios-5-battery-life-fix-tips/\nReset Network Settings\nTap on “Settings” > Reset > Reset Network Settings\nDisable Bluetooth\nSettings > General > Bluetooth > “OFF”\nDisable Notifications & Apps in Notification Center\nSettings > Notifications > Turn OFF for anything you don’t need\nDisable iCloud\nSettings > General > iCloud > Turn everything to OFF\nDisable Location Services\nSettings > Location Services > Disable selectively for services you don’t use\nDisable Time Zone Adjustment\nTap on “Settings” > “Location Services” > ‘System Services’ > Setting Time Zone to OFF\nDisable Ping\nSettings > General > Restrictions > Enable Restrictions > Ping > OFF\nDisable Diagnostic & Usage Reports\nTap on “Settings” > General > About > Diagnostic & Usage > Don’t Send\nDelete eMail Accounts, Reset Network Settings, Re-add eMail Accounts\nDelete your email accounts by going to “Settings” > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Account Name > Delete Account\nNow Reset Network Settings in “Settings > Reset > Reset Network Settings\nReboot the iOS device\nRe-add email accounts back in “Settings” > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account\n\nA: Mine is draining the battery faster too, but I think it is due to location services. I usually have no location app running, but I've been trying the new Reminders app with the \"at location\" option and that implies keeping the location service active all the time.\nOn the other hand, with iOS 4 my iPhone could handle 1-2 hours with the location service active, and now it works for almost 8 hours.\nI've turned the location service off to confirm that is the problem.\n\nA: For me, disabling iTunes WiFi sync seemed to do the trick. Before, other methods like disabling location services and Ping, removing mail settings, etc. did not make any difference before - the battery would go from 100% charged to dead within 3-4 hours.\n\nA: I have fixed a lot of iPhone batter problems in my day, and people who think they might even have a hardware problem find if they restore the device as new and sync the data back, they generally notice a large improvement in battery life. This is especially noticeable in upgrades of the operating system.\nObviously this is just hearsay, but I have heard it and said it a good thousand times.\n\nA: GPS tracking does consume indeed a lot of power. Therefore disabling location based services should do the trick.\nSomebody suggested to switch off iTunes WiFi sync - however this should not matter, because it gets activated only when your iPhone is plugged in to power.\n", "Q: Will upgrade of iOS delete any of my videos or photos? I wanna upgrade to the latest iOS 5 and wonder if my existing photos and videos at Camera Roll will be still on device. Is that right? Or I have to backup them before upgrading? If so, how would I do that - iTunes doesn't seem to backup those things at sync.\n\nA: The photos and videos in Camera Roll are not synced with iTunes - they are, instead, the \"raw\" photos meant to be synced to the photo-organization tool you use - whether that's a set of folders in your filesystem, or iPhoto.\nIn other words, when your iPhone is mounted as a \"USB camera\" (on Windows) or when iPhoto opens (when plugging it into your Mac), the contents of the Camera Roll are what you see.\nThat being said, iOS 5 will delete all of this data during the upgrade, so you absolutely should back them up before going forward! Assuming you're using a Mac, plug in the phone, open iPhoto, and import everything before doing the upgrade.\n(And I recommend making a backup of your phone, transferring purchases, and then syncing everything you can with iTunes before going forward... the iOS 5 upgrade appears to be a very destructive procedure.)\n\nA: The photos aren't synced but definitively are backup by iTunes.\nI just upgraded to iOS 5 and my photos are still at my camera roll\n\nA: You run the risk of losing your pictures if you don't have the \"Sync Photos\" switch turned on in iTunes.  The iOS 5 upgrade may completely wipe your iPad/iPhone so you have to do a resync to bring everything back.  But that will only work if you've already backed it up and have sync turned on.\nBe safe, not sorry.\n", "Q: iBooks ePubs lost all cover art after iOS5 update After I upgraded to iOS 5 on my iPad 2, iBooks no longer shows any cover art for ePubs that I have imported. Anything that is from the iBook store shows art fine, along with PDFs.\nIs there a solution to this?\n\nA: Yes, I found that if you remove the books from the iPhone, then add them again via sync the cover art should return.\n\nA: Try removing all iBooks form the iPad and the re-sync them again that fixes it.\n", "Q: Sharing files with others using iCloud? From what I know, iCloud is like a personal storage and you uses your own Apple ID for it. Is it possible for users to store for example an image and be shared with other users?\nWhich means something like DropBox. You upload files into your DropBox account and there will be a url that allows other people to download the file.\nDoes iCloud has this kind of function?\n\nA: I don't believe so, no. iCloud is meant to be a cloud-based backing store for apps, not a file-syncing service like Dropbox. It's a subtle difference, but consider that all interactions with your iCloud data happen through apps (Address Book, iCal, iPhoto, iTunes...), rather than with the individual files themselves.\nSo any sharing functionality for a given type of data will likely be delivered through the associated app(s). Whether it will make use of iCloud directly is uncertain, but although still in early days that doesn't seem to be the current pattern. \n", "Q: Is the iCloud service upload only? Does the iCloud service upload and download data or does it only upload and if so how fast will it be using a 3MB/s line?\nDoes it upload everything from my iPad or only the installed application names which are then downloaded from the Apple servers?\n\nA: Both. Upload and download. Upload speed depends entirely on your networks limitations.\nLet's take a scenario. You have an iPhone, an iPad, and a Mac. You enable all of iCloud's features, including Photo Stream. You take a picture on your iPhone of your dog. As soon as that picture is saved to your camera roll and your phone is connected to wifi, it sends it to iCloud. \nWhen you access your iPad, the photo will be there waiting for you under the Photo Stream group. But that doesn't mean it's downloaded to the device just yet. You will first have to tap on the thumbnail to view it and at that time, it will be stored locally on the device. From that point, even if you remove the photo from Photo Stream, say using iCloud.com, it will still be stored on your iPad (and any device that has downloaded the image). Because Photo Stream removes content that's 30 days old, over time, it will be the case that photos may be stored on some devices, but not others.\nThis applies to your Mac as well. Depending on whether you have enabled Photo Stream in the iCloud preference pane, you'll also need to enable it in either iPhoto or Aperture to fully make use of the service. In the respective app's preferences, you can tweak how it manages the service. \nKeep in mind this only works for pictures taken after you've enabled the feature. So if you disable it and take a photo, that remains locally stored, never to be transferred to Photo Stream.\nThings like documents and calendars sync instantly. So if you make a change in Address Book on your Mac, the changes will be pushed to iCloud. Once you open the app on your iPad, for example, it will download the updates. It's unclear at this time if Apple's servers push the changes to devices connected to the Internet. Calendar too. iCloud will try to keep all your settings ubiquitous across all your devices so you don't have to worry about syncing or manually transferring the new contacts you added on your iPad to your phone or Mac. It's meant to be as seamless and unobtrusive as possible, and require as little user activity and management as possible. \nNow most people are still conceptualizing iCloud as a sync service, but it's not. The master version of any file is kept on Apple's servers, and then fed to any device that needs it (read: any device that is deemed to either not have the file at all or simply lack the updated version). Most people think because you made changes to your calendar events on your Mac, that that data is held as the master and pushed through iCloud to your other devices (this is traditional sync), but that's not the case. It's fed to iCloud yes, but it's iCloud that takes it, holds onto it, and delivers it to any device that needs it; your Mac is no longer involved once it sends the necessary information. It's all iCloud from then on, and this is why you'll be greeted with a notice when you disable the calendar feature on your Mac (or any device) that it will wipe all local content. Since iCloud holds the master files, any device that is detached from the \"network\" will have their data removed in kind (some, like Address Book) won't but the majority will have their local contents deleted. This serves to strengthen iCloud's control (or dominance in the network) and denounces any device that is removed from its fold, so to speak. And if you think about iCloud as a true cloud service, this makes perfect sense, as you wouldn't typically be disconnecting devices unless they were no longer of use to you (when say you upgrade your iPad 2 to the next generation, or when you buy a new Mac to replace your old one). While critical things will remain (contacts), most files won't survive a disconnection from iCloud.\nAs for storing backups of your applications, and other miscellany, that too replaces your local content. All your app settings, game saves, etc. become part of iCloud. And again, once they are there, your local data becomes just another extension of the service. You can view what it stores by going into Settings > General > Usage. It will show you a breakdown of your content (and the respective amount of space it takes).\niCloud is meant to replace local data and move everything into the cloud so you can access it from any device and a wireless connection. It de-regulates local data, so to speak, as a result. It's a bit confusing at first, but once you understand the general principle, it becomes much clearer to understand as a whole.\n\nA: I would add that local data in fact becomes just a cache of the master data kept by iCloud. It is however a cache that can be modified, with the modification pushed back to iCloud. And as with all caches, you don't need anymore to worry about it : in the worst case (corruption, accidental deletion, loss of device) the cache can be reinitialized with the master version from the cloud.\nA side effect is that you then become totally reliant on Apple servers, their availability or pricing...\n", "Q: What is the difference between backing up and syncing an iPad/iPod/iPhone? What is the difference between synchronizing an iPad/iPod/iPhone compared to backing it up? Is it not the same thing?\n\nA: A backup it part of a sync.  Synchronizing your iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Saves a backup of the installed apps and all personal data (contacts, saved games, documents, etc.)\n\n*Adds or removes music, podcasts, etc.\n\n*Copies the latest version of apps to or from your iPhone.\n\n*(I don't remember the rest of the steps off the top of my head...)\n\n\nThe backup is useful if your iPhone has to be reset to factory settings or is lost.  You can restore your backup to your fresh iPhone and it will reinstall the apps along with all of their data.  Without a backup, you would have to manually type in all of contacts, reproduce your documents, and start your games from scratch.  You'll still have to restore your music manually, but that's a minor issue.\n\nA: To expand on Hand-E-Food's answer.\nA backup is a complete snapshot off your device at that particular point in the time the backup is made. Not every synchronize causes a backup, and the backup does not contain actual copies of the Apps, Music, Books or Photos stored on your phone. It does however contain all the settings, contacts, calendars, saved games and anything else not handled by the synchronize.\nA synchronise copies all Apps, Music, Books and Photos to the phone, and works in conjunction with the backup. When you restore a backup, it will require you to synchronize to retrieve the actual Apps etc.\nYou can synchronize your phone irrelevant of the backup state, and if you don't restore a back after a reset, you can continue synchronizing items the way you did before the reset, however all your application settings, saved games etc. will be lost and has to be reconfigured and restarted.\n", "Q: After i downloaded the new iOS 5 for my iPhone 4 safari isn't any different? i downloaded the new iOS 5 for my iPhone 4 and safari is the same as it was and i was under the assumption that it would be somewhat different?\n\nA: There are some under-the-hood improvements to performance, and also some changes to the settings (such as a private browsing option), but there aren't any major changes to the Mobile Safari interface on the iPhone. The iPad version now has tabbed browsing instead of the window-switcher, but the iPhone is too small for such a thing to work.\nThe two features you may notice are Reading List and Reader. Reading List is essentially a  bookmarks folder that can sync with desktop Safari. You can add items to it from the Share item (centre button on the bottom toolbar). Reader will reformat some webpages (long articles) to make them more readable, removing ads and menus so that you've just got the text. You can access it from the grey Reader button in the address bar once the site loads (note that it's not available on all sites, just those that Safari can competently reformat).\n\nA: It includes the Reading List feature:\n\nThe Reader function to pull out articles from messy and convicted websites (like BBC or CNN):\n\nAnd contains a slew of performance enhancements and changes under the hood. Other than that, it should look and behave quite the same as its predecessor. Apple covers the new features if you'd like to read more about them.\n", "Q: is there an app button for the voice control on an iPhone 4? is there any way besides holding the home button to get to the voice control on the iPhone 4 like an app button or anything?\n\nA: The (very) short answer is \"No there isn't\". \n\nA: If you bring the phone up to your ear, Siri should activate. However, the only button for interacting with Siri is the home button. \n", "Q: How to stop syncing apps with iTunes without wiping them from my iPhone? Is there a way I can stop syncing apps with iTunes without first obliterating the apps from the iPhone and re-downloading them?\nNow that iOS 5 and iCloud are released, I want to stop storing all my apps on my computer, and instead just let them be downloaded directly to each of my devices. Music, podcasts, etc. should still sync with my computer.\nHowever, when I deselect \"Sync Apps\" in iTunes, I get the message:\n\nAre you sure you do not want to sync apps? All existing apps and their data on the iPhone \"myPhone 4\" will be removed.\n\nIt seems like an awful waste of time and bandwidth to force the phone to redownload all my apps just to tell iTunes to stop syncing them.\n\nA: What worked for me was to setup my device for wifi sync first. Make sure under the edit menu and preferences / devices (this is important) that you have it set to prevent automatic sync. Right click on the device in the left pane of itunes and reset all warnings. Have the cable disconnected but the device still visible via wifi. Uncheck sync apps, then ok the warning about removing the apps from the device. Then click \"summary\" and uncheck sync over wifi then apply in the lower right.\nNow reconnect via cable turn wifi sync back on and sync your device via wifi or cable doesn't matter which. Now disconnect the cable, goto apps in iTunes and delete all apps. Ok the warning about removing the apps from the device. Goto summary and uncheck sync via wifi and click apply in the lower right. Then you can reconnect with your usb cable and turn on sync via wifi again.\nAt this point a popup will tell you that there are apps that you need to transfer to iTunes or they will be removed from your device. Check don't show this again and then click don't transfer. Now you can go into edit and preferences under General and uncheck apps altogether if you want the iTunes apps folder to go away as well.\nI did this with both my iPhone and iPad2 and I still have my apps on them.\nGood Luck.\n\nA: From testing, it seems you can't break that link without having to re-download. Since the change requires you to synchronize the phone, you will need to re-download the files from the phone once you've un-ticked the box, since the synchronize does remove the applications completely.\nUnfortunately the answer to your question is right now there isn't a default way, but I suspect it will become possible in future iTunes versions.\nI have looked for possible hacks to do this and have yet to find one that doesn't require jail breaking to copy the files back.\n\nA: Or you could try this info from the help section of iTunes:\nYou've set up automatic syncing, iTunes syncs your device by default whenever you connect your iPod, iPhone, or iPad to your computer. If you don’t want iTunes to sync your device without being prompted, you can change this setting.\nYou can prevent unprompted syncing for any specific iPod, iPhone, or iPad; or for all iPod, iPhone, or iPad devices you connect to your computer.\nTo prevent unprompted syncing for all iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices: To sync your iPod, iPhone, or iPad when unprompted syncing is disabled, connect your iPod, iPhone, or iPad to your computer, and then choose File > Sync “Device Name” in iTunes, or click your device (below Devices) and then click Sync.\nFor more information, see the iPod, iPhone, or iPad User Guide or the Apple Support website.\n\nA: *\n\n*Uncheck the \"Sync Apps\" checkbox\n\n*Answer yes to all the warnings about apps that will be deleted from your phone\n\n*Once synching actually starts, quickly press the \"x\" button in the iTunes status window to stop the synching. Pulling the cable should also work but I haven't tried it.\n\n\nSince the synching process was stopped, no apps were deleted, but the unchecked checkbox is still stored -> all apps left, but no longer synching apps to computer.\n\nA: iTunes 10.6 asks you whether to Keep or Delete apps on your iDevice when you uncheck \"Sync Apps\"\nOnce you uncheck the box and apply, if you decide in the future to Sync Apps it appears that it may overwrite everything, so YMMV\n\nA: In the latest version of iTunes (answer current as of 12.0.1), just click this button.\n\n\nThis is a facetious answer. Actually it cannot be done, as evidenced by numerous forums on Apple with no solution to this common pain point: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3784727\nApple uses this pain point to force users to upgrade to newer phones and laptops with more storage and/or give up privacy by enabling \"cloud\" features.\n", "Q: How do I enable Find My Mac in a Macbook Pro (Mid 2009) running OS X 10.7.2? After updating my system to Mac OS X 10.7.2 I was able to activate all features of iCloud, except for Find My Mac that stays greyed. It says \"Recovery partition required\".\nI have a Macbook Pro, Middle 2009 model, and it was updated from Leopard to Snow Leopard to Lion.\nSearching Apple's support website I could find articles on how to create the Recovery HD in an external drive, but I can't find how to create the partition in the internal drive. I have enough free space to repartition, and I have already created a 1 GB partition at the end of the free space (Apple recommends 1GB when creating the partition in an external drive).\nI understand the Recovery HD is necessary for Filevault 2 too, so there must be a way of creating it after installation, but I can't find how. Anyone knows how to do that?\n\nA: Here's a way to manually create the Recovery HD partition, but it seems complicated for a novice user.\nIf you don't feel sure about your self into doing this, then I suggest you to re-install Lion.\n", "Q: How can I use iCloud to sync my contacts, while also syncing my contacts with Google? If you have Google contact syncing enabled in 10.7.1 or earlier, then upgrade to 10.7.2 and try to enable iCloud contact syncing, you will see the following dialog:\n\nIs it possible to have both worlds?  I would like to sync with iCloud for my iOS/mac devices, but ALSO sync with google for my gmail/android devices.  This used to be possible with mobileme.\n\nA: Doesn't look like this is presently possible.  Only way to get this to work is use Google Contacts as the main source, and then set OS X Address book to sync to Google, and use Google ActiveSync on the iPhone to also sync contacts with Google.\n\nA: Well... I also want to use contacts from GMail. So... After reading that there was no solution, I came to a very simple solution: Don't use iCloud for contacts. Period.\nEach Apple device can be setup to sync with GMail contacts - and that's it.\nWorks for me.\n\nA: As for Contacts, the best solution, as of March 2012, is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Contacts as the main source, you get backups for free without doing anything\n\n*On OS X, configure the Address Book to sync to Google\n\n*On iOS, configure Gmail as Exchange, not as Gmail (counter intuitive but that's the way!)\n\n\nKeep iClould out of your contacts for some time, until Apple will include native support for Gmail contacts, which I doubt.\n\nA: Ignoring iCloud and using Google's ActiveSync is not a solution which works for everyone. ActiveSync is limited in number of data entries in your address book which can be synced, and the name of these data entries. In short:\n\n\n*\n\n*3 email addresses\n\n*2 home numbers\n\n*1 home fax number\n\n*1 mobile number\n\n*1 pager number\n\n*3 work number (one will be labeled 'Company Main')\n\n*1 work fax number.\n\n\nNumbers have to be named exactly as stated above. Other names like \"Support\" or \"Hotline\" won't be synced without displaying any errors.\nSee Google Sync Known Issues with iOS for more information.\n\nA: Currently, doesn't seem possible.This website categorically says so. \n", "Q: Why don't accepted event invitations through MS Exchange show up in iCal?

When I click Accept, the sender is notified and the email is moved to the Trash. But the event itself does not show up in iCal.\nI've poked around a little already. The entire invitation email is base64 encoded and has a vCal attachment with the event.

Except... when I try to enable 'mail and notes' under iCloud settings, it just gets stuck displaying 'starting'.\nIf I go to my mail app, I am greeted by the message \n\nCannot send mail, failed to connect to the iCloud server.\n\nWhen I try to use mail from iCloud.com, I am greeted by the message \n\nTo use iCloud mail, create an @me.com email address by turning on mail in your iCloud settings, using iOS or OSX.\n\nHowever, I am never prompted to create an @me.com email address when I turn on mail in iCloud settings.\n-\nWhat might have caused the problem:\nA couple of months ago, I reserved my @me.com email address by creating it on my brothers laptop (because he's a developer). In fact, I can even log in to iCloud using this email address. \nSo basically, some part of Apple's database believes I have an @me.com address, but the mail portion of iCloud doesn't think this is the case and still wants me to create one.\n-\nI'm pretty stuck on this - any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.\n-\nEdit:\nI had some ideas on a couple of things that might fix it, but don't know where to start on them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do iCloud settings have an associated .plist file? Sometimes\ndeleting/modifying .plist files can solve problems. I've had a look\nfor one but couldn't seem to find one easily - if there is one, where\nmight it be located?\n\n*If anyone else has this issue, what happens when you try using iCloud\nmail from an iPhone/iPad etc?\n\n*Apple support is impossible to contact if you're out of the phone\nsupport period (I'm still under warranty though). What ways might I\nbe able to contact Apple, in case it's an issue with their database?\nCould I file a bug report somewhere, or send an email to some hard to\nfind email address?\n\nA: You may just need to wait.\nI transferred my MobileMe account to iCloud on iOS 5 launch day. I encountered the same issues that you seem to be having in that when I tried to use the mail app on iCloud.com it gave me same error message as you received. When I tried to turn mail and notes on in the iCloud system preferences, it just hanged on 'starting'. All other features were working correctly.\nI just trumpet it up to high demand on Apple's servers and decided to wait. I just tried now and my email is working from both iCloud.com and mail.app.\n\nA: I know it is silly, turning mail ON from settings->icloud solved the issue for me. \n\n\nA: I had similar issues initially with two AppleIDs where one of them was defined as the alternative address for the others. Finally I used https://appleid.apple.com/ to clean out these issues. Might be worthwhile to try with your mac.com/me.com addresses/IDs as well.\n\nA: After digging through the support forums for a few hours it seems that this problem is known and that there is still no general solution. The only way to solve this right now seems to be to use an ios 5 device. This probably means that this bug is in lion icloud preference pane. If you can get your hands on an ios 5 device try setting up from there. You can also use a friend's device and delete the account data when you are done. Your friend will be able to log back in to his own account with no problem.\n", "Q: How can I remove iOS 4.2 from an iPad? I need to remove iOS 4.2 beta from an iPad which I added using iTunes and the option+click Restore button feature. \nWhen I click \"Restore\" in iTunes I get an error (image attached). I have the iOS SDK & XCode installed.\n\n\nA: Step 1: You need to put the iPad into recovery mode.\nPress and hold the home and sleep/wake buttons until the device shuts off. Keep holding the home key until the \"connect to iTunes\" graphic appears on the screen.\nStep 2: Make sure you have iOS 3.2 somewhere on your system.

I'm a little distracted at the moment.\n\nA: You need to have iOS 3.2 because that's the only other iOS version that supports iPad. Follow the steps Moshe posted. \n", "Q: Will I lose my game saves when I upgrade to iOS 5? I have heard that if I update my iPhone to iOS5 it will take all of the apps off of my phone and I will have to manually put them back on. Does that mean I will lose any savegames or game progress in the games I have on my iPhone?\n\nA: The short answer to your question is no. You will not lose your games. However, you must know how to save them and how to bring them back after upgrading to iOS 5. A friend of mine with an iPod Touch had the same concerns about his saved Angry Birds data. I walked him thru upgrading to iOS 5 and this is how we did it: \n\n\n*\n\n*Using iTunes and an USB cable, we backed up the iPod Touch. Make sure you are running the latest version of iTunes (10.5 as of this writing). \n\n*We upgraded to iOS 5 from the Summary tab for his device.\n\n*Once iOS 5 starts, on the initial setup screens (in the iPod Touch itself), we told the iPod Touch to restore from a backup in iTunes. \n\n*We continued the rest of the set up as normal. We used his Apple ID to create an iCloud account. I highly recommend using iCloud. \n\n*Once you're done with the initial setup, you can go to your device in iTunes and check on \"Use Wi-Fi syncing for this device\". You can detach the USB cable for good--This is one of my favorite features of iOS 5. \n\n*In the iPod Touch, we went to Settings > iCloud > Backup and Storage to tell iCloud to backup this device. You can then manually trigger your first backup from that screen. \n\n*Once backup is completed, your device will show up on this same screen as backed up. You can tap on its name to go to another screen where you can individually set which apps you want to keep in and out of your iCloud backup. This is very handy when deciding how to use your iCloud storage space. Most apps take very little space on the server, but there may be some apps that not, so it is worth to take a peek. This screen tells you exactly how much each app is using. Make sure to add all of your games that have data that you wish to back up. \n\n\nNext time you need to restore your device, iCloud will restore all of your saved games this way over the air, rather than having to restore from iTunes with a USB cable. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Yes, you can upgrade your iPod and have your game data saved.  The caveat is (at least with the below solution), you must have an operating system current enough to backup via iCloud on both your old and new iPods.\nSolution We Used\nMy son unfortunately bought an 8GB iPod that quickly became useless so we upgraded eventually to a 32GB.  Both iPods have a current operating system (OS) with iCloud backup ability.  The first step is to backup the \"old\" iPod to iCloud (Settings, iCloud, Storage & Backup, iCloud Backup to \"on\" and then backup).  Then take the new iPod and start walking through the intro menus until you eventually have the choice to restore from iCloud backup.  Choose that option.  As you should be using your same Apple ID as the \"old\" iPod it should find the last backup you did from that \"old\" iPod.  Use that to restore.  It will restore all of the general data first and then proceed to reload all of the games.  When the games load, they should have your game progress saved as well (did for us anyway).\nNOTE: If you had made previous unsuccessful attempts to restore onto the new iPod, before using iCloud simply erase the new iPod and start over (Settings, General, Reset, \"Erase All Content and Settings\"). \niTunes Limited in Success\nWe tried a number of methods before this using iTunes and only some game progress transferred to the new iPod (basically those that save data via the internet like Clash of the Clans).  But other games like Subway Surfer, etc. wouldn't save progress.  Using the iCloud backup method worked and was fairly simple to do.  As far as the other jail breaking efforts and finding specific game files, etc. (the Angry Birds post) we didn't have to do any of that (but may be necessary if \"old\" iPod does not have iCloud backup ability).  You would think an iTunes restore and backup should be at least as effective as an iCloud backup, but apparently not.  \nGood luck.  Hope this helps.\n\nA: I just upgraded to iOS5 last night and all of my apps, with their data, along with all my music, photos, videos, and the like were all restored. I will say that the content restoration process is a choice automatically presented to you that can opt out of. The process takes a while—I have a very full 32GB iPhone—and the whole process took a few hours including the time backing up and restoring. Just pay careful attention to all of the dialog windows presented and you should be up and running in no time.\nThere is, however, a backend feature change for the OS that developers need to manage that might affect your data. The caches where apps can store temporary data will get cleaned automatically upon a lack of space on the iPhone. A lot of apps store their data in caches as opposed to Documents, but not all of them. If an app developer uses the cache folder and doesn't do something about this automatic cache cleaning on the part of the OS, then, yes, there is a possibility that you will lose your data like game saves. But, just to make very clear, it all depends on how the app was programmed by the developer. There is nothing about the cleaning the developer can do, but you can by making sure you don't completely fill up your device. \nYou can read about this cache-cleaning issue in detail here: http://www.marco.org/2011/10/13/ios5-caches-cleaning\n", "Q: Many Compile Warnings while Installing MacPorts I recently upgraded to Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2.  I also installed the latest version of Xcode (version 4.2) in order to build MacPorts.  After doing this, I had no problems executing sudo port selfupdate, which downloaded the latest version of MacPorts (version 2.0.3). However, I saw a LOT of compile warnings, especially for packages/ports like Python, when executing sudo port upgrade outdated.  For other packages/ports I noticed that a couple of compiler options were obsolete and/or ignored.  Otherwise, I had no problem rebuilding MacPorts.\nAre the compile warnings generated during the build a result of poor programming, or are they a product of the (possible) changes to the gcc compiler?  If the compile warnings are a result of poor programming and, as I didn't notice such warnings when initially installing MacPorts under Snow Leopard, have the compiler options to suppress such warnings changed?\nAs for those compiler options that were obsolete and/or ignored, is this also a result to (possible) changes to the gcc compiler, or is this a feature of the script used for rebuilding major releases of MacPorts?\n\nA: I encounter this most when I see compile flags including -Wall (warn all) which a great deal of open source devs tend to use.  Warnings are not always bad or even worrisome.  \nIf you're paranoid, take the time to go through and investigate each of the warnings but before you do that try compiling some code of your own with the warn all flag set for gcc and see how many warnings you get.  They are quite common. \n\nA: Recompile warnings - some programmers will remove all warnings as being a good idea whilst others leave them as they are only warnings. I favour the former interpretation but that view is not universal so you can't say a lot of warnings is a problem unfortunately\nFor macports I would worry about ignored gcc command line errors - so we need to see some of these \n", "Q: How to update iOS5 beta 7? I've got iOS 5 beta 7 on my device (I installed the first beta in June and then updated it a few times wirelessly without any problems) and now, when the final version of the iOS was released, if I'm checking for software update in the device setting it says that my version is up to date which doesn't look as true. \nThus I'm wondering if I can update my device without resetting OS version?    \nThanks in advance. \n\nA: You can't upgrade a beta device to the final GM release. You need to restore the device with final public iOS 5 release.\n", "Q: Why don’t events created in iCal show up in my iCloud calendar? Yesterday I installed Mac OS X 10.7.2, iOS5, and set up my iCloud.com account. I entered my iCloud details in System Preferences in Mac OS X, and in Settings on iOS. In both places, I set calendar syncing to “On”\nHowever, I just created a test event in iCal, and it didn’t sync to iCloud.com or iOS. Events created on iOS sync to iCloud and iCal just fine.\nWhat’s going on?\n\nA: It turns out I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add my iCloud account to iCal, in iCal > Preferences > Accounts.\n\n*Set my default calendar to one of my iCloud calendars, in iCal > Preferences > General.\nSee e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-operating-system/253324-lion-ical-not-syncing-icloud-calendar.html\n\n*http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1249011\nIt seems a bit strange that I had to do this manually — you’d think just turning on Calendar syncing in the iCloud preference pane would do it.\n\nA: I changed my \"Refresh\" settings in iCal preferences from \"push\" to \"every five minutes.\" For some reason, this got things moving again and started syncing.\n", "Q: alias youremail@me.com(icloud) from a custom domain (like Google Apps fyd) Similar to how Google Apps for you Domain works with your own domain (by using the mx record settings). How would I setup icloud email to achieve this?\nCustom domain is not suppored out of the box (and maybe will never be...?) so I could hack, like in the days before GAmail, when everybody forwarded to gmail.com:\nSetup GAmail to forward all email to icloud. But then icloud should change all sender headers from me.com to my domain. Are there other consequences of importance? Or is this not recommended at all?\nAlternatively, maybe the best route is to use me.com as a personal domain, and your GAmail as businessmail, and use them side by side. I believe mail.app can have a mailbox for each?\nFor users happy with push GAmail over imap on their devices, does icloud mail offer any advantages? A 3th solution is to just switch off icoud email, and only use icloud's other services...\n\nA: iCloud is just IMAP under the hood.  It's not possible using the default configuration to use an email address that is now supplied by iCloud (whether using the old me.com or the new icloud.com), but it is possible to configure in a non-standard way to achieve the same effect, but it does require the use of a 3rd party SMTP server to achieve this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Basically, on your device, setup iCloud as normal.  Then amend the preferences and turn off Mail and Notes\n\n*Then, in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars choose Add account > Other > `Add Mail Account\n\n*Enter your Name, the email address you wish to use, the password of your iCloud account and a descriptions along the lines of Custom iCloud Mail then Next\n\n*Leaving the top details as you entered them, and ensuring you stay on the SMTP tab, not POP, enter the following in the Incoming Mail Server fields:\n\n\n*\n\n*Host Name: imap.mail.me.com\n\n*User Name: Your iCloud username as the full email address\n\n*Password: Your iCloud password\n\n\n*In the Outgoing fields, enter the details of your SMTP server, you may use gmail server addresses in here if you have a GMail account, or use a paid hosting company like I do.\n\n*Click Next, and it will attempt to verify the details.  Hopefully it will all work fine, and put a load of ticks next to all your inputs\nThat's pretty much it, you now have iCloud configured normally for everything except mail and notes, and mail should send through your own servers allowing you to use what you like as your email address for return purposes.  Don't forget to forward all your mail to your iCloud account.  Sent mail will still remain in your iCloud sent mail folder, regardless of the fact that is is being sent through a 3rd party server so there is no need to bcc yourself to keep a copy, unlike with some other solutions.\nOne last thing, why include notes and exclude them from iCloud?  Because notes are just mail items stores in a special IMAP folder.  Turn them off in the new manual account you created, and you will see the Notes folder appear in Mail.app.  Turn it on, and that folder is hidden and the notes are shown through the Notes.app instead!  However, you will end up with duplicates, unless you turn off your iCloud version of the same folder.\nThings to note, you can use this setup for pretty much any normally unsupported mail client, including the one in iOS4 etc in say in iPhone 3G\n", "Q: How do I set up iCloud for a family? What is the right way to set up iCloud for a family? Assume that I want to share iTunes store account, have separate mail, contacts, bookmarks and notes, but have the possibility of sharing calendars and reminders, and have all devices appear under one ID for Find My iPhone. It would be nice to share data as well, so that I only need to add space on one account for backups. Is this possible?\nIf not, what is the best way to set up for a family with, at a minimum, shared iTunes account for purchases?\n\nA: If you have multiple devices spread among family members and also share your iTunes account with family members, this should help:\nArticle: How to Use iCloud in a Family Setting:\nhttp://appadvice.com/appnn/2011/10/how-to-use-icloud-in-a-family-setting-share-apps-but-not-contacts\n\nA: iCloud does not offer family accounts at the moment, and there is no migration path if you do have one. That may change in future, but I suspect Apple may not do it since iCloud is now free compared to MobileMe. \niCloud isn't big on sharing, so each family member will need their own account for email, calendars, contacts and device backups. Possibly consider creating a separate iCloud account that can invite the other family members to be events so you can \"share\" your calendars in that way, or just ensure that when creating an event on your account you invite the rest of the family.\nYou can however have one Apple Id to make purchases with. I do this since I have a American and South African account. My South African account is a fully migrated iCloud account for email, calendars etc.\nMy American account is simply an Apple Id and I use it solely for purchasing applications, books etc. \niCloud backs up all my devices to my South African account so I have backups of everything, and the purchase histories and updates goes through the American account. On my devices and in iTunes I am always signed into the App Store using my American account so never need to switch, iCloud on the devices is configured for my South African account.\nFor file sharing I suggest looking at something like DropBox.\n\nA: You can add 2 iCloud accounts to the same device. But on the secondary account you won't be able to enable things like Backup and Photostream.\nEG I have my account for Apps (I had the first iOS device in my family so I had the most apps to start off with), Music and Books and Find My iPhone, but a shared account for backups and iMessage. (on my families iPad).\nI long for the day Apple let you have different Users on an iPad.\n", "Q: Photo Streams from two or more iCloud accounts into same iPhoto library? I'd like to connect iPhoto on my MBP to my photo stream and my wife's photo stream. We each have our own Apple ID and iCloud account. Can iPhoto connect to multiple iCloud photo streams?\nThanks. \n\nA: Currently it can't. Photo Stream settings are detected via the iCloud preference pane and is global to your machine. Until it can support multiple iCloud accounts, iPhoto can only connect to one Photo Stream at a time. Since it's only a temporary store of the last photos taken I am assuming Apple will most likely not make this possible.\nI normally move my photos from the Photo Stream to Flickr to achieve this since you can have multiple Flickr accounts.\nLook into Dropbox with photo upload if you want to merge photos from multiple devices into one collective stream. From there you can use the Mac client and Folder Actions to automate importing, processing and other tasks as needed.\n\nA: Family Sharing is not a good option because you manually need to select the photos you share.\nIf you want you and your wife to have access to all the same photos, the solution is to use the same iCloud account for photo sharing for both of you. This also means you only need to pay for iCloud storage once.\nWhat makes this feasible is that you can then setup your wife with a separate iCloud account for Notes, Email, Calendar, etc under Mail, Contacts, and Calendar. So, you can just share Photos.\nNote, though, that you will want to turn off her iCloud access to Passbook, Safari, and Keychain, as you probably don't want to share those. I leave on Backup, so that all Backups are going to the primary account (mine), and we don't need to pay for more storage for her.\nFinally, this meant that we needed to use Find My Phone for location sharing rather than Find My Friends.\nObviously, Apple should add an option to Family Sharing to share 100% of photos. But until they do, this is a workable scenario.\n", "Q: For some reason I can't open files on drive I can't open the files on certain drive that is formatted as ntfs. I have Tuxera installed however. Here is an image on how they look:\nThe file with a lock is password protected as it should.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix this? For some reason the files I can't open are somehow transparent.\n\nA: First thing, make sure that it's no locked and that you have the correct permissions :\n\nIf you have extended attributes you can get rid of those by doing the following :\n1- Do ls -l@, under the file it will give you something like \"com.apple.FinderInfo\". Copy that\n2- Do xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo path/to/file\nIf nothing works then your last option is to sudo it :\nsudo open path/to/file\nAlso see if you can open it using a mac that those not have Tuxera installed on it.\n", "Q: Contacts keep disappearing from iPhone 4 when iCloud is turned on I updated my iPhone 4 to iOS5 yesterday morning, and noticed after the install was complete that the contacts seem to have disappeared completely from my phone after setting the Preference for them to sync with iCloud.\nFind a forum post from July suggesting creating a new text message in the Messages app and typing the first few characters of a contact's name to see if they still exist - which works, suggesting that having the contacts sync with iCloud causes some bug where the contacts merely aren't displayed in the Contacts app.\nI then turned off iCloud-syncing for Contacts, and all my contacts were displayed normally again.\nA few hours later, I test turning iCloud-sync for Contacts back on, notice no side effects; login to www.icloud.com later and see all of my contacts listed there.\nThen this morning I open the Contacts app on the phone and it displays no contacts again. Turning iCloud syncing back off fixes it again.\nIs there a better way to fix this and a way to fix it so that it doesn't happen in the future?\n\nA: I've had this problem with iPhone 5\nUpdated IOS, about 2/3 of contacts disappear. Tried some of solutions, best one yet\nSettings > Contacts>\nImport SIM Contacts>\niCloud\nAnd boom they are back, for now!\n\nA: I experienced this and my contacts are NOT set to sync with iCloud. I rebooted my phone, and they reappeared. Try this first before messing around with your settings.\n\nA: If another device is using the same iCloud account that contacts of that seconds device can override the contacts on your iPhone. I have lost many important notes due to this. I have an iPhone 5 and iPod Touch 4th Generation and when I connected the iPod Touch to my iCloud account (with the iPhone already being connected) the notes on the iPod Touch overrode those of the iPhone 5.\n", "Q: Is it possible to sync two iPhones with different service providers via iCloud?

How can I get all of my contacts from my AT&T phone to my Verizon iPhone since I am required to carry that one 24/7.  Is there a way to do that through iCloud?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is exactly what iCloud (and MobileMe did in the past) does for contacts.\nUnless your company phone uses a company supplied directory (in which case just connect your personal phone to the company directory) you can sign up for a free iCloud account and store your contacts on both the devices in the cloud.\nYou could also sync from iCloud to a computer (PC or Mac) as well to an iPad, but you don't have to and can simply use it to sync the address book contents between the two iPhones.\n", "Q: App for File store and viewer I am looking at an ipad app which can be used to store files locally as well as supports multiple types for viewing.

The Mac Mini will act as an Open Directory server and will store each Mac user in the office's home directory on it.\nIt's easy to set this by using the Server.app tool and choosing a local share for the home directory. However it seems that I can't set it. When I try to choose the share instead of \"Local only\" it doesn't save the choice.\nHow can I get around this? Or alternatively, how can I use the Directory viewer to set this manually? I can see the field that sets the home directory, but I'm not sure of the format required to choose a network share.\nAlso cross-posting on Serverfault as I'm not sure which is the best place to post this.\n\nA: I was able to figure this out a while ago, but I realized I only posted the answer to my question on Serverfault. Here's the solution for this:\nI ended up setting up Lion Server at my house, creating an Open Directory user with a remote home directory, and looking in the Directory Utility to see what the actual keys were set as. I was then able to use Directory Utility on the client's computer to set the keys manually and it worked perfectly.\nHere are the keys you need to set assuming the server's hostname is server, and the directory is /Users/test on the server:\nkey: HomeDirectory\nval: <home_dir><url>afp://server/Users</url><path>test</path></home_dir>\nkey: NFSHomeDirectory\nval: /Network/Servers/server/Users/test\n", "Q: Multiple iPhones devices synced to the same iTunes, how to keep podcasts straight? This maybe similar/related to this question.\nI have my iPhone and my wife's iPhone synced to the same iTunes with different accounts. I sync my podcasts to 3 most recent that have not been listened to. If we listen to some of the same podcasts then we will effectively 'hide' the ones that one has listened to from the other that has yet to listen to it.  \nIs there a work around for this?\n\nA: Have you considered using Downcast, or the Podcaster on your device instead of using itunes for podcast management?  By using an application each device will store their settings separately.  This does have the downside that podcasts that you both listen to, would be downloaded twice.  I long ago gave up on using iTunes for podcast management, Downcast is a far better tool, in my opinion.\n", "Q: Is the iPhone 4S hardware compatible worldwide with other SIM based networks? I particularly want to know if iPhone 4S can work with other networks that use SIM cards when the device is authorized to be unlocked. With these conditions, can it take a SIM card when traveling?\n\nA: The iPhone 4S is a world-phone, compatible with Verizon and Sprint's CDMA networks in the US and GSM networks worldwide. It has a micro-SIM slot for connecting to GSM networks. Most phones sold in the US are locked to the carrier you buy it from, you may have luck getting them to unlock it so you can use a different SIM. Unlocked iPhones are (tautologically) unlocked, so you can use any SIM card, but they cannot use the aforementioned CDMA networks.\ntl;dr: yes.\n", "Q: Can I use iTunes Wi-Fi Sync to sync podcast positions? It seems that iTunes Wi-Fi Sync only kicks in automatically (when plugged in) if there is new content, but not modified content. If I listen to a podcast on my Mac, the time remaining in the podcast is not synced with my iPhone. I have to go into Settings and manually perform a sync for this to happen.\nIs there any way to have this happen automatically, or should I rely on a third-party tool such as Seamless?\n\nA: If you plug your device into power, a sync should occur no matter what. Between that and manually triggering a sync (whether from the device or iTunes), I've had no problems with podcast location syncing.\n\nA: I believe iTunes Wi-Fi Sync will be triggered at least one daily as long as both the computer running iTunes is on and the iOS device is plugged into an electrical outlet. As you mention, you can manually trigger syncing from Settings in iOS; and you can also do it from iTunes by right-clicking on the iOS device and selecting the Sync option.  In other words, once the iOS device is on the same wireless network, it will show in the devices list in iTunes as if it was plugged in by USB.\nI have verified that the position where you last were playing a video or a  podcast is part of the Wi-Fi sync as well. This is a very handy feature. Hope this helps. \n\nA: wi-fi sync worked perfectly for me on the first day but the automatic feature still isn't happening. i deliberately changed some items in playlists and listened to some podcasts on mac and bought some music from app store on phone so that lots had changed (hoping to force it to sync) it's been left for 2 days and still no automatic sync. It's been plugged in to power source and iTunes open pretty much constantly. Manually syncing wi-fi works so why is the automatic feature not kicking in which is what i want it for really anyway.\n", "Q: How can I listen to free radio on an iPhone? Is it possible to listen to the radio for free on the iPhone? \nDo I need a special app? \nI have downloaded some apps for digital radio that require payment, but I just want to listen to regular free radio\n\nA: If you're referring to normal, terrestrial radio such as you'd get in your car or a cheap clock radio, the answer is that you cannot. At least, not without buying a receiver, something like this Griffin radio receiver.\n\nA: There are radio apps in the iPhone app store that will give you radio stations in your area and elsewhere.\n\nA: At the risk of stating the obvious, you can listen to Pandora—internet radio—for free on your iPhone.  And for a small fee you can listen without advertisements. \n\nA: There's a good radio app called Tunein Radio Pro which allows you to listen to over 50,000 radio stations across the world and which is cheap to buy, $0.99 in the US.  There's also a non-Pro version which is free.\n", "Q: Difference between iCloud and MobileMe I never used MobileMe and am struggling with getting iCloud to work properly for me, but I'm wondering...\nNow with the iCloud launched what's the difference between iCloud & MobileMe. They both still exist in the System Preferences after 10.7.2 update.\n\nA: The reason they both still exist is because they are still separate services being offered by Apple. Users of MobileMe prior to the announcement of iCloud paid a yearly subscription fee for the service. Rather than refund those customers, Apple will continue to offer the MobileMe services only to those subscribers who have an active subscription. \nMobileMe stopped accepting new customers around June 2011. If I am not mistaken, it will be until June 2012 that those users will end their subscriptions. At that moment, all MobileMe services will stop functioning and I expect Apple to update OS X so that the MobileMe System Preferences panel will be removed. \nThis article by Apple contains more information on the transition from MobileMe to iCloud, as well as a comparison table that shows which MobileMe services will continue to exist in iCloud. The short version is that with the exception of iWeb publishing, MobileMe Photo Gallery and iDisk, the rest of the MobileMe features will be found in some way or another in iCloud. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Can I wirelessly download videos from my iPhone camera roll to my Mac? I have an iPhone4, upgraded to iOS5, and a Mac running the latest Lion updates as well.  The new Wireless Sync feature keeps everything up to date with iTunes, and the iCloud Photostream takes care of getting my photos into iPhoto.\nHowever, there doesn't seem to be any way to wirelessly transfer videos taken on the phone from my camera roll to the Mac. Will I still need to plug the phone in via USB and import my videos into iPhoto?\n\nA: It seems that an USB cable is still required. \nThe article in Apple Support that shows how to import videos into iPhoto has not been updated recently. Either Apple is still behind in updating these support articles (not likely) or there is nothing to update--in other words, you still need USB. \nThe release notes for iPhoto 9.2 list the major updates to the app. It mentions that iCloud support is now included, but nothing specific about importing videos wirelessly. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Is there a way to configure apps to download automatically similar to podcasts in iTunes? I'd like for apps to download 'free updates' whenever they are available so when I sync my phone they will already be there, similar to podcasts. \nIs there a way to configure iTunes to do this automatically?  \n\nA: There currently isn't a way to do this. Especially with iCloud app downloading, I don't think there's any technical barrier to automatic updates. I think it's probably an intentional decision by Apple to keep app updates manual. That way, users are not surprised when an app suddenly changes UI or gains/loses features. However, I personally think the benefits of auto-updating are greater than the costs, especially for the users who never ever update apps.\nI'd highly suggesting taking a trip to apple.com/feedback and submitting this as a feature request. I'd love to see this as a preference added in. Apple (surprisingly) does place a lot of stock in user feedback, so the more requests about a certain issue, the better.\n\nA: Sadly, as of iTunes 10.5.0, there is no way to do this.\n\nA: This is now possible for jailbreakers.\nCheck out \"Auto App Updater\" on the ModMyI repo.\nIt does exactly that! I just installed it and it's perfect.  For those of you that are worried that it's a bad idea to update apps without making sure they don't have \"major bugs\" should turn off auto updates for your mission critical apps in the settings.

I'm not sure if this is do to a recent change to my user setup, or Lion, or what.\nI've used Elgato's EyeTV software as my home DVR for 6 years, with the now-discontinued EyeTV 500, through a wide variety of updates, always without major problems. This was the first place I noticed video problems, so I initially suspected a software incompatibility. However the problem has also affected DVD, Netflix (Silverlight), iTunes (h.264) and Flash video playback.\nIn upgrading to Lion, I decided to do a clean install onto what had been the DVR drive, while keeping my Snow Leopard install around for a bit. After I was happy with the migration, I turned what had been the Snow Leopard drive into a DVR drive for EyeTV. However instead of running EyeTV under my only user, as I had been, I set up a new user, with the idea being:\n\n\n*\n\n*My wife wouldn't need my admin account's password to watch shows she wanted to record\n\n*We wouldn't have to toggle audio settings back and forth when running video to the living room (my user would stay on headphones, this media user would stay on toslink out)\n\n*The media user could be set to automatic login without a password, so if power was lost when we were't home, when it came back, the DVR would come back too\n\n\nUnfortunately what's been happening consistently is that if my admin user is logged in, with a few things running (nothing crazy, Mail, Chrome, iTunes, iPhoto, Terminal, etc.), video becomes unplayable, with whatever app that was doing video playback getting the Rainbow Wheel of Death every few seconds and lasting for several seconds.\nI'm not sure if this is related, but if both users are logged in, the Lion login/user switching screen itself becomes nigh-unusable, possibly requiring multiple forced sleeps to figure itself out.\nAt this point I don't know what the problem is, although I have some guesses:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't have two users with conflicting sound output settings logged in at once (this is what I'm going to try first)\n\n*The media user needs to have admin privileges\n\n*There is some bug in Lion (unlikely, but I can't isolate this variable since I added the user at the same time as I upgraded).\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I experienced a similar problem with a 2012 MacBook Air with two users logged in. Both users logged in, stuttering video via AirPlay, OS X 10.8, 8GB RAM, plenty of room on the SSD. When using an iPad or iPhone on the same wireless network and AirPlay, no stuttering.\nLogged out the second account, no stuttering.\nI haven't solved any of your other issues, but did confirm the concurrent login problem.\n", "Q: iCloud Restore — WiFi only? If I enable the iCloud Backup feature, can I later restore from an iCloud backup, but while tethered to iTunes?\nSo if my phone ever dies, is the only way to restore from iCloud to do it over WiFi, re-downloading every app, or is it smart enough to let me plug into iTunes, use the iCloud backup to figure out which apps go where, and then push the actual apps from my PC onto my iPhone?\nThe closest question I could find is this\n\nA: Yes, you can restore from iCloud, but to restore your device, you have to connect it to iTunes, and restore its firmware, then restore contents either from iCloud or from backup on your mac.\n\nRestoration that’s not a project. When you set up a new iOS device or\n  need to restore the information on one you already have, iCloud Backup\n  does the heavy lifting. Just connect your device to Wi-Fi and enter\n  your Apple ID and password. Your personal data — along with your\n  purchased music, TV shows, apps, and books from iTunes — will appear\n  on your device.2 If you’re an iTunes Match user, you can download your\n  entire music library from iCloud.3\n\nSo the point is this: if you want to restore your contents from wifi, you just plug your device, and connect it to wifi, iCloud will do its job; if you already tethered your device to iTunes, you can just restore it from mac.\n", "Q: Apache works, 127.0.0.1 is accessible, but http://localhost/ is not In 10.7.2 update Apple roll out new bug, - hosts bug.

When I get a notification, my phone has the standard \"message received\" sound for e.g. Twitter.\niOS 5 has sound settings for Text, Voicemail, Mail Received, Sent, and Tweet.\nHowever, the Tweet sound seems to only apply to outgoing tweets, not received ones. In Notification Center settings, I can turn on \"Sound\" for each application, but is it possible to change the sound for app notifications globally, or better yet, per-application?\n\nA: This is one of the bigger changes in iOS 5. Under Settings -> Sounds you can change quite a few tones including Twitter, Mail and Sent Mail. It's not everything but the major one's are covered and a huge improvement from the previous versions. \nThey've also added a considerable amount of new tones, and you can now assign custom tones to all of them which previously didn't work.\n\nIf you are referring to the notification beep you hear when you are inside the application itself, that will depend on each application if the developer has setup an option to change it. These aren't notifications as such, but rather built into the application and triggered by events inside the application.\nSome applications, for example, What's App, will allow you to change the notification in it's own settings. \nThe short answer to this therefore is that it depends on the application, some can be globally controlled, and others need to have the ability enabled inside the application.\n\nA: Not so far. You can do decide whether to turn on the sound or not for particular app (if it enables user to turn off the notification sound). But you cannot change the notification sound globally or per-app (not at least in iOS 5).\n\nA: If you don't like the alert sounds that came with that new app you just downloaded, they're actually pretty easy to change—and you don't even need to jailbreak your phone.\nUnfortunately, this only works with non-Apple apps that use their own alert tones. If the app is using a tone that came with the iPhone (like Google Voice's app does), you'll need to be jailbroken to change it. Jailbreaking isn't that hard though. If you don't want to jailbreak, here's how to change an alert tone.\n", "Q: iOS 5 OTA sync went over 3G instead of wifi I upgraded my iPhone 4 to iO 5 last night, setup iCloud and went to sleep.\nIn the morning, I noticed that my fully charged phone had completely discharged and my Mac iTunes was showing a notice that sync had failed with the iPhone.\nLater today, I got an email from AT&T saying that I have used my 200 MB plan by 90% and I should take care.(It was about 100MB yesterday)\nDid the iCloud sync over 3G last night? (My iPhone and Mac were both on my home wifi network that did not break during the night)\nI was playing with the iMessage feature and I sent an email to one of my other (non-AppleID) email IDs from it, just to check. The email came thru with the email ID being my_phone_number@mms.att.net \nand this was when I got that 90% email from AT&T. \nI don't use SMS so I've completely disabled it by calling the AT&T call center. \nWhat caused my 3G plan to be over used? The MMS or iCloud?\n\nA: \nDid the iCloud sync over 3G last night? (My iPhone and Mac were both on my home wifi network that did not break during the night)\n\nNo. iTunes can only sync over Wi-Fi. Any automated backup to iCloud can only be done via Wi-Fi as well. However you can initiate a backup via 3G but not a sync since iTunes can't \"see\" the device if it's not on the same network, and in most cases you will receive a warning that it will use your data plan.\n\nI was playing with the iMessage feature and I sent an email to one of my other (non-AppleID) email IDs from it, just to check. The email came thru with the email ID being my_phone_number@mms.att.net and this was when I got that 90% email from AT&T.\n\nHighly unlikely. Messages sent via iMessage, unless they contain huge images, are even smaller then most emails. The system also sends it as one single message and is not considered email actually.\n\nWhat caused my 3G plan to be over used? The MMS or iCloud?\n\nIf you manually started a sync with iCloud then that would be the case, however, your iPhone will always use the Wi-Fi first, and it is something I specifically tested during beta, if the iPhone can't find a Wi-Fi connection to automatically sync or backup it won't initiate the processes at all.\nIf you sent a massive message with images via iMessage, probably, but iMessage is not considered email, and it is sent via the Apple servers. \nI would suggest you look at other areas of your phone, or most probably and app that is abusing your bandwidth. One thing it could possibly be is automatic iTunes Store downloads where you have an option to turn on Mobile Data for downloads. You can find this under Settings -> Store.\n\n", "Q: \"Install Xcode.app\" won't uninstall from my Mac I downloaded the new Xcode 4.2 update yesterday and installed it.

I found this program http://chaosspace.de/launchpad-control/ which allows you to add/remove LaunchPad icons.  I removed the icon, re-added it and then deleted it which also deleted the application /Applications/Install Xcode.app\nUser cksum then suggested this might have corrupted my database and I think he is right, however, it looks like Lion recovered it.

There is no way to keep these categories intact, and it can be a huge problem, especially when sharing items with others since the minute they make a change to a shared item, the categories are overwritten.\nYou could possibly however use an AppleScript to add them manually, I haven't tried thought.\n\nA: we had the same problem.

I just got a new 4S and am not seeing notifications pop-ups from Twitter.  I'm using the Twitter for iPhone app.  How can I enable new tweets in notification center?\n\nA: New tweets in Twitter can't be added to the notification centre, thankfully. It will only notify you in the notification centre if your mentioned or receive a direct message.\nThe settings for the Twitter notifications can be found in Settings -> Notification Centre\n\nAlso make sure you have your Twitter set up correctly under Settings -> Twitter after installing the Twitter app.\n\n\nA: Go under Settings and look for the Notifications app and you should see listed there all the apps you have in your iOS.

Is there any way to create a hard link in the finder?  \nA hard link in terminal would be created with:\nln /path/to/file /path/to/newpath\n\nwhereas a symlink / alias can be done by holding command and option or\nln -s /path/to/file /path/to/newpath\n\n(though apparently the behaviors of 'alias' and 'ln' are different)\n\nA: You could create an Automator service like this:\n\nThis takes the selected files and creates hard links to them in the directory where they exist. You can then drag and drop the links to the location where you want them.\nThis will work for files with spaces in their names, but not for files containing quotation marks in their name.\nYou can access it from the Finder » Services menu, the context menu, and you can assign it a keyboard shortcut analogous to the ⌘ L shortcut for aliases (perhaps ⌘⌥L).\n\nA: There's no way to do this in Finder.app itself.  However, if your goal is just to avoid typing the commands into Terminal.app then you could use Automator.app to create a workflow to do the commands for you.\n\nA: I actually wanted the link term in the rename with the extension preserved\notherwise finder wouldn't recognize the filetype.\nso I used Daniel's Answer(thanks for that) and changed it a bit\nfor f in \"$@\"\n do  \n  dir=$(dirname \"$f\")\n  filename=$(basename \"$f\")\n  extension=$([[ \"$filename\" = *.* ]] && echo \".${filename##*.}\" || echo '')\n  filename=\"${filename%.*}\"\n  ln \"$f\" \"${dir}/$filename Hardlink$extension\"\ndone\n\nEDIT: added what I think is better extension handling code - should be blank if no extension is present.  Sorry, I am not good at coding scripts so please share any fixes you think this needs.\n\nA: Yes, indirectly. \nAutomator let's you make services that run any shell script and also can ask you for a path to the destination for the hard link (since it won't be in the same location as the original presumably). I suppose you could default the link location somewhere like a desktop too. \nJust add a step to pop up a dialog to enter or otherwise choose the destination and pass that to your ln command. \n\nA: Nice solution provided by Daniel, but I suggest replacing his script code by the one below which preserves the file type.\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo  \n  ln \"$f\" \"Plink-$(basename \"$f\")\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: After deleting an app, can you (much) later reinstall it and restore its data from iCloud? I have several games that, combined, use up a pretty good chunk of my iPhone's flash.  I haven't played some of them for a while, and would like to remove them.  However, at least before iCloud, deleting an app also deleted its data.  Since I may go back and play them again, I'd rather not lose said data.\nAfter backing up to iCloud, can you delete an app, and (possibly much) later reinstall it and restore your data from the iCloud backup?\n\nA: The answer is yes and no.\nWhat happens quite easily after a restore (for example after an update) is that iTunes restores the save data for all applications, but not the applications themselves. Therefore as soon as you install them, the old save games will be available (this applies to all apps, not just games). Just by itself nothing will be saved without backup.\nBUT: If the application supports iCloud sync and stores it's data in iCloud (which has to be explicitly supported), your data will be still available after deleting and reinstalling the app. \nIn short: You should be really careful and unless you're absolutely sure the application in question does support iCloud for your saved data, don't delete it without backup.\n\nA: There is no general answer to this question as each game app is highly specific with regards to where the game progress is stored. On some games such as Candy Crush, the score is stored locally on the iPhone unless you connect to Facebook at which point, the game progress is automatically transferred and saved to a cloud account associated with your Facebook profile. I think the case is similar for Clash of Clans. \nHaving said this, if your game(s) happen(s) to store the game progress locally on the iPhone, you can back up the progress like instructed here (using a free PC iPhone-app explorer): How to backup iPhone games and transfer game scores to another iOS device \nYou can also restore the game and the progress to another iPhone when you feel the need to play. \n\nA: And the answer is Yes! Before I upgraded to iOS5, many games I didn't play had been deleted.\nI reinstalled those games from the cloud after the update (I did not sync with my Mac's iTunes) and I had all my scores saved! That data was not backed up anywhere on my Mac (How do I know this? iTunes was eating a lot of space on my HDD, so I obliterated all the apps and games I had backed up in it pre-iOS5 a few days ago).\nThat tells me my data was in the cloud even before I went down the iOS5 lane.\nBTW, these apps that you install and delete, I don't think they take up extra space in the iCloud. Correct me if I'm wrong.\nBut I'm sure of one thing - go ahead, delete your games, your scores will be recovered when you re-download the app.\n\nA: i had Hobbit KOM and I deleted it because it was going slow and i do this about 2 times a month and I lost all of its data i played for a year and now all my work is gone. So...no.\n", "Q: Is there an iPad app that lets me share my iPad screen with someone at another computer at another location? Is there an iPad app that lets me share my iPad screen with someone at another computer at another location? I'd like an app that lets me write stuff with my stylus (like note taker HD) and have that appear on someone else's screen on a computer at another location. If there is no such app, I'd be happy with some hack that lets me do this through my computer. (Now what I tend to do is write a bunch of stuff and have note taker HD email it to the other person.)\n\nA: There's a Mac app called AirServer that enables you to mirror your iPad 2 onto your Mac. Maybe from there you can get this to another location...\n\nA: If you simply want to share live drawing on your iPad and nothing else, Air Sketch is a good app. You launch the app and it provides you with a local IP and port to type into a web browser, and your drawing on the iPad will show up live.\nLinks: Air Sketch ($9.99) Air Sketch Free (Free, obviously)\nAlso: while this only tells you to use a local IP (192.168.X.X:8080), I have not tested using a global IP with it.

Am I going to have to download them again? \n\nA: I think this can happen if you're a bit premature unplugging your iPad from iTunes.  Try plugging it in and resyncing.  \n\nA: Assuming you didn't have any backup app like pkgbackup, you can still reload them from iTunes if you bought them.\n", "Q: How can I force Lion to use iCloud? Here's my situation: I have the new iPhone 4S which is using iCloud beautifully. However, my MacBook is still using MobileMe. When I go into System Prefs > iCloud, it has a big button that says \"Click here to move your MobileMe account to iCloud.\"\nWhen I click that button, the browser goes to me.com/move, then I log in, and it immediately redirects to me.com/find and then a screen appears saying \"Ok, you're all set, you may now start using iCloud.\"\nExcept... I'm not. When I go back to the System Preferences > iCloud, it still has the \"you need to move from MobileMe\" screen and the button to start the transition. And I am 99% sure that my contacts, calendar etc are not syncing with iCloud, so I can't get them on the phone (that's a problem).\nSo... the phone is all set on iCloud, but I need to tell Lion to use it. I assume the me.com/move web page someone would send a message back to Lion saying \"ok, this user has made the transition, now you can show the 'real' iCloud preferences panel,\" but that hasn't happened.\nHELP!\n\nA: I found the answer: log out of MobileMe in the System Prefs panel, and then the iCloud panel will prompt you to log in (instead of offering the \"Move to iCloud\" button).

Using Automator I set up a Folder Action to monitor my screen shot folder and rename any new files exactly the way I want them. \nThere's a decent guide here with a similar approach and instructions.\n\nA: I have disabled the default shortcuts and assigned a shortcut to this command:\nscreencapture -i ~/Desktop/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).png\n\n-i (interactive) is like ⇧⌘4 or ⌃⇧⌘4.\n\nA: Open terminal and enter:\n$ sudo su\n\n$ cd /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj\n\n$ plutil -convert xml1 ScreenCapture.strings\n\n$ nano ScreenCapture.strings\n\nchange\n<key>%@ %@ at %@</key>\n    <string>%@ %@ at %@</string>\n<key>.</key>\n    <string>.</string>\n<key>Screen Shot</key>\n    <string>Screen Shot</string>\n\nto\n<key>%@ %@ at %@</key>\n    <string>%@_%@_%@</string>\n<key>.</key>\n    <string></string>\n<key>Screen Shot</key>\n    <string>screenshot</string>\n\nthen\nControl + O to write the file, and Control + X to exit nano\n$ plutil -convert binary1 ScreenCapture.strings\n\n$ killall SystemUIServer\n\nOne more thing to note here is that to get rid of AM/PM you will need to change it in System Preferences > Language & Text > Formats (24 hour format). Time stamps are displayed according to how this is set; keep in mind if you change this setting all filenames will use this format.\n~ Let me know how it works out.\n\nA: The same effect of the complicated terminal actions shown above can be achieved through the free secrets preference pane, which serves as an interface for all sorts of hidden setting in Mac OS and it's apps. Simply open the pref pane and find the setting u want to change\n\nA: You can change 'Screen shot' to 'screenshot' with the following commands  \ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture name screenshot\nkillall SystemUIServer \nIf you want to go digging a bit deeper in Terminal, you can achieve what you want by doing the following:  \nNOTE: Make a backup of any files you change in case you make a mistake.  \n\n\n*\n\n*cd /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj\n\n*Make a copy of the existing file:\nsudo cp ScreenCapture.strings ScreenCapture.strings.old\n\n*Enter Admin password if prompted\n\n*Convert to an editable format:\nsudo plutil -convert xml1 ScreenCapture.strings\n\n*sudo vi ScreenCapture.strings \nLocate the following lines:  \n<key>%@ %@ at %@</key>  \n<string>%@ %@ at %@</string>  \n\nand replace with the following lines:  \n<key>%@ %@ at %@</key>  \n<string>%@_%@_%@</string>  \n\n\n*Convert back to binary:\nsudo plutil -convert binary1 ScreenCapture.strings\n\n*killall SystemUIServer\nwhich combined with the first change should get you something like this:  \nscreenshot_2011-08-30_10.01.36.png which is very close to what you need I think  \n\nA: IMO you should absolutely not muck around with anything in /System/.\nFor one thing, you are just asking for your customizations to be overwritten by a future update.\nDownload the demo of Sharpshooter from http://www.kerlmax.com/products/sharpshooter/\nYou can use it for 30 days. Then buy it for $15. It's a great utility.\nAlternatively, have you tried Skitch? It's completely free, and a lot better than the built-in.\n\nA: I liked Adrian B's answer. Here's the shell script I wrote to rename screen cap files: https://gist.github.com/DinoChiesa/7796444\nTo set it up as a Folder Action, follow this article.  \nWhen you get to the Automator window, follow this guide: \n\nDon't forget to save it (Command-S). \nIt takes 3-6 seconds, in my experience, for that folder action to \"kick off\" after I capture the screen.  \n\nA: just use 2 commands:\nd̶e̶f̶a̶u̶l̶t̶s̶ ̶w̶r̶i̶t̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶.̶a̶p̶p̶l̶e̶.̶s̶c̶r̶e̶e̶n̶c̶a̶p̶t̶u̶r̶e̶ ̶n̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶\"̶s̶c̶r̶e̶e̶n̶s̶h̶o̶t̶_̶$̶(̶d̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶+̶%̶Y̶_̶%̶m̶_̶%̶d̶-̶%̶H̶_̶%̶M̶_̶%̶S̶)̶\"̶ ̶\nd̶e̶f̶a̶u̶l̶t̶s̶ ̶w̶r̶i̶t̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶.̶a̶p̶p̶l̶e̶.̶s̶c̶r̶e̶e̶n̶c̶a̶p̶t̶u̶r̶e̶ ̶\"̶i̶n̶c̶l̶u̶d̶e̶-̶d̶a̶t̶e̶\"̶ ̶0̶\n\nyou can also change the default screenshot location (in my case this is a folder in iCloud)\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location \"~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com\\~apple\\~CloudDocs/screenshots\"\n\n", "Q: iOS 5 setup freezing at set up email I am trying to update my iPad first generation to iOS 5. It is freezing at the \"Set Up Email\" screen after I enter my email address and password. I have already clicked on the link in the email that asked me to verify my contact email address. Any thoughts on how to get past this?\n\nA: I was able to update my 1st Gen iPad to iOS5. I would begin by shutting down the iPad and rebooting it. Make sure that all your apps are closed out and then try the upgrade again. \n", "Q: Restore a backup without restoring OS iTunes makes automatic backups each time I want to sync in a different day (if I recall correctly) - what if I want to restore to a backup WITHOUT having to restore the whole operating system? Can it be done?\n\nA: iTunes doesn't restore your OS during a normal restore, it only restores backed up information which is listed below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Contacts(1) and Contact Favorites (regularly sync contacts to a computer or cloud service such as iCloud to back them up).\n\n*App Store Application data inlcuding in-app purchases (except the Application itself, its tmp and Caches folder).\n\n*Application settings, preferences, and data, including documents.\n\n*Autofill for webpages.\n\n*CalDAV and subscribed calendar accounts.\n\n*Calendar accounts.\n\n*Calendar events.\n\n*Call history.\n\n*Camera Roll (Photos, screenshots, images saved, and videos taken. Videos greater than 2 GB are backed up with iOS 4.0 and later.)\n\n*Note: For devices without a camera, Camera Roll is called Saved Photos.\n\n*Game Center account.\n\n*Home screen arrangement.\n\n*In-app purchases.\n\n*Keychain (this includes email account passwords, Wi-Fi passwords, and passwords you enter into websites and some other applications. If you encrypt the backup with iOS 4 and later, you can transfer the keychain information to the new device. With an unencrypted backup, you can restore the keychain only to the same iOS device. If you are restoring to a new device with an unencrypted backup, you will need to enter these passwords again.)\n\n*List of External Sync Sources (Mobile Me, Exchange ActiveSync).\n\n*Location service preferences for apps and websites you have allowed to use your location.\n\n*Mail accounts (mail messages are not backed up).\n\n*Managed Configurations/Profiles. When restoring a backup to a different device, all settings related to the configuration profiles will not be restored (accounts, restrictions, or anything else that can be specified through a configuration profile). Note that accounts and settings that are not associated with a configuration profile will still be restored.\n\n*Map bookmarks, recent searches, and the current location displayed in Maps.\n\n*Microsoft Exchange account configurations.\n\n*Network settings (saved Wi-Fi hotspots, VPN settings, network preferences).\n\n*Nike + iPod saved workouts and settings.\n\n*Notes.\n\n*Offline web application cache/database.\n\n*Paired Bluetooth devices (which can only be used if restored to the same phone that did the backup).\n\n*Safari bookmarks, cookies, history, offline data, and currently open pages.\n\n*Saved suggestion corrections (these are saved automatically as you reject suggested corrections).\n\n*SMS and MMS (pictures and video) messages.\n\n*Trusted hosts that have certificates that cannot be verified.\n\n*Voice memos.\n\n*Voicemail token. (This is not the voicemail password, but is used for validation when connecting. This is only restored to a phone with the same phone number on the SIM card).\n\n*Wallpapers.\n\n*Web clips.\n\n*YouTube bookmarks and history.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Your contacts are part of the backup to preserve recent calls and favorites lists. Back up your contacts to a supported personal information manager (PIM), iCloud, or another cloud-based service to avoid any potential contact data loss.  \n\n\n\nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4946\n", "Q: After iOS 5 install, only some purchased ringtone transfer to iPhone After install of iOS 5 on my iPhone 4, I noticed that only 2 of my ringtones installed. I resynched. I explicitly requested a sync of my 7 purchased ringtones. Same result: iTunes synced the same 2 of 7.\nI'm on OS X 10.6.8.\nHow can transfer all of my ringtones to my phone?\n\nA: Similar thing was reported on Apple's forum (don't have the reference handy).  One guy said he fixed it by: deselect all ringtones, sync, select again, sync.  Another guy said he fixed it by downloading a single new ringtone.\n\nA: I used iTunes to drag-and-drop from Library/Ringtones onto the iPhone icon in the sidebar. Other restore attempts failed. \n", "Q: How can I change the colors of calendars on iOS5 Supposedly, you can change the colors of calendars from the iPhone now. How!? (In particular, I'm trying to do it for google calendars synced via exchange, but I can't see how to do it with iCloud ones, either.)\n\nA: You can do this in the Calendar app.\n1) Tap Calendars in the upper left corner:\n\n2) Then tap Edit:\n\n3) Select the calendar you want to change the colour of:\n\n4) Pick the colour you want. If you want a more extensive selection than what's in the list, you need to do it from iCal on your Mac.\n\n", "Q: Restore address book I am running 10.7.2 and had my Address Book synced to the iCloud.  I inadvertently deleted all of my contacts from my iPhone (synced with iCloud) and now my address book is empty.\nI've attempted to restore all of the files in ~/Library/Application Support/Address Book but when I do I can see the cards briefly (for about 1 second) and then they disappear from Address Book.\nI also backed up my Address Book (prior to deletion), but opening this file yields the same results.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I was attempting to work out a bug with iTunes.  iTunes was refusing to put my contacts on my new iPod.  And no groups were showing in iTunes.\nOne thing led to another, and I found myself looking at a blank address book.  You can imagine my consternation when my iPhone contacts got smoked before I could shut down a sync.\nI could import from my backups, but, like the original poster, the contacts would appear for about a second before disappearing again.\nShutting down the contacts iCloud sync and then logging out of iCloud worked.  I was then able to import either one of my two backups without issue.\n\nA: If you want to restore ONLY your contacts from your iCloud acccount (assuming you have a viable contacts list) to your iPhone, here's how I did it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to your iCloud account; go to your Contacts and click the asterisk in the lower left corner; choose select all; and then open the menu again and choose export vcard (vcf); it will export a file containing all selected vcards. Save this file to your desktop.\n\n*For Win7 (other versions are probably similar): Open Windows Contacts for the appropriate user; click Import from toolbar at the top; browse to the .vcf file you saved to your desktop. A separate vcard will open for each one; click the OK button for each to be added to Windows Contacts. (Sorry if you have hundreds/thousands, maybe there's a faster way to add them all, I'm not sure.)  PLEASE NOTE: If you already have people in your Windows Contacts list that you DO NOT want added to your iPhone Contacts, you need to move them around or delete them or whatever PRIOR to importing the .vcf file. You need to be left with only the contacts you want to be transferred to your iPhone. Understand that ALL contacts in Windows Contacts will be imported into your iPhone Contacts list.\n\n*Once the contacts are imported into Windows Contacts, open iTunes and connect your iPhone. On the info tab select \"Sync\" with \"windows contacts\". Go further down the page to the Advanced menu and choose to replace information on this iphone and check the contacts box. Make sure any other options (apps, music, etc.) are unchecked since you are correcting your Contacts only. Click the Sync button. Your iPhone Contacts should now match your iCloud contacts. I could not figure out any other way to get the iCloud list to the iPhone...\nWorked like a charm...\nOnce you get your iPhone just the way you want it, this is the time to use iCloud backup. If you don't know how to do this, Google Search \"turn on iCloud backup.\"\nHope this helps some of you that may have the same problem I did with screwed up Contacts lists.\nsberg\n\nA: I also fell foul of the cloud, Due to a misunderstanding about skype contact import I did a backup and deleted all my contacts ( to remove them from skype) then logged out of skype and tried to restore, I got them displayed for a few moments and then they all dissapeared, unfortunately all my devices were online so they got removed from everywhere (with me.com you had the option to manually update which I had my home server set to) so I wouldn't have had this problem. \nanyway to solve it I did the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*select to not sync contacts with icloud\n\n*disconnect network cable (very important) \n\n*restore contacts from backup\n\n*select all contacts in the icloud section and copy to the On My Mac section, including any groups (very important)\n\n*reconnect network cable\n\n*select to sync contacts with icloud choosing the merge option \n\n*wait for sync and and check it really has worked\n\n*breathe a sigh of relief\n\n\nA: You'll have to restore them from your most recent backup.\nThere are a number of ways to backup Address Book (Time Machine, Export Address Book Archive..., or vCard), so restore them whichever way you backed them up.\nOnce your contacts are back in Address Book, chose Reset Device in iSync to ensure the contacts go from computer to phone.\nMaybe all you can try to transfer your iphone contact and address book to computer first.\nMore reviews: \nHow to transfer iPhone contacts from iPhone to PC\nHow to transfer contacts from iPhone to Mac OS\nHope that work you out.\n\nA: After you export the address book, just email them to your phone.\nIf you use the same email address on your computer, just email it to yourself, then use your phone to check for new emails. (So you receive the new email on your phone instead of your computer)\nDownload the attachment and it'll ask if you want to add all of the contacts to your list.\nHit Merge and it'll update ones that don't exist instead of replacing them all.\nHay presto! All the contacts are now back in your list.\n\nA: Try turning off iCloud first (Preferences → iCloud → deselect Contacts), then  restore from your backup.\n\nA: I just had the exact same problem. I went into iCloud on my iPhone, switched off contacts, selected \"Keep contacts on iPhone\". Then I went to iTunes, connected my iPhone to my mac and clicked on the Info tab. Just tick the box that says \"Sync address book contacts\" a=then hit apply at the bottom of the screen. Hope this works for you. \n\nA: This appears to be a bug with contact metadata, but it does not happen when restoring from \"fresh\" vCards. Here's how I worked around this bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable iCloud on your Mac (iCloudPref.prefpane -> Sign Out -> Delete local data)\n\n*Restore your contacts (from Time Machine, .abbu backup file, 3rd party backup program like CrashPlan, etc.)\n\n*Open Address Book, and you should see all of your contacts\n\n*Select all contacts -> File -> Export -> vCard -> save this file\n\n*Enable iCloud on your Mac (the contacts will disappear again)\n\n*Import the vCard file you just created\n\n*Verify that the contacts appear on the iCloud website and your iOS devices\n\n\nHat tip: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1256807\n", "Q: Set my default address for auto-fill?

I've been downloading using Transmission, and when (sometimes) stopping or starting a download, my Mac would hang to a state where the Force Quit dialog would not even activate, it would then stay in this state for as long as I let it. I had to force restart every time. After a few force restarts, it lost its start-up disk, and it takes longer than usual to boot up.\nI got scared a bit and started backing up the HDD to an external last night. I was busy playing music in iTunes while backing up when I observed the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Music would stop playing for a few seconds\n\n*The beach ball would start spinning during this time\n\n*Data transfer to the external drive would pause\n\n*And I would hear a very soft spinning sound in the background, a repeating noise which leads me to believe the HDD is struggling to read/write.\n\n\nObviously the HDD has some sort of problem, however, rather than assuming it's failing, can I fix it in some way? Could it be a cache error or file system corruption which can be fixed with a clean install of Snow Leopard? Any way I can fix this without having to buy a new HDD?\nBTW. I have run both Repair Permissions & Verify Disk multiple times on this drive, and Verify Disk always returns a green message which states the HDD is fine. Also, S.M.A.R.T. status shows as Verified in Disk Utility.\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: Your own advice is fairly good in this scenario. \nThere is a possibility that you have just some serious file system corruption, but usually Disk Utility should catch that. If you want, you can boot into single user mode (CMD S on boot) and it will give you a little file system cleanup command you can run\nfsck -fy and then press enter, when it finishes you reboot. \nIf this doesn't help, reinstalling after performing a backup is not a bad idea because it will isolate it to a software or hardware issue. The hard drive going over some area repeatedly could be just file system screw ups, but usually repeated noises are a bad sign for a hard drive, clicking etc. \nIf the problem comes back after the reinstall you definitely want to look into a new hard drive. Four years is not an uncommon life span for some hard drives.\nAlso just a quick point of clarification, the S.M.A.R.T status doesn't predict all failures, it just presages specific ones it can determine. Just because it isn't telling you your drive is failing doesn't mean it wont. Keeping everything backed up is a really good idea at this point.\n\nA: I'm pretty convinced that this is a case of a dying drive. All the signs are there.\nThe best thing you can do is get as much data off as possible and then get your machine repaired at an Apple store or authorised service provider. Unfortunately a HD swap on an alu iMac is neither entirely trivial or fun.\nDuring the backup process I'd recommend not using the computer for anything else and closing all unnecessary apps and background apps/services.\n\nA: You are clearly aware of the issues involved and potential solutions. For the safety of your data I would recommend 2 additional things you can do. \nA disk which makes unexpected noises is probably failing. The failure may happen soon or take some time. Nevertheless, it's always best to assume the worst, to check you backups work and to get a replacement as soon as possible. S.M.A.R.T. is useful although a random check may not show a problem. For continual monitoring and visible notifications of S.M.A.R.T. status, you should consider installing a utility such as SMARTReporter.\nMemory, especially cheaper memory, isn't always reliable. Checking for memory problems is best done when you first get a new computer, and whenever you upgrade or install new memory. Of course, with the issues you describe, this is also a good time to investigate further. The most common method is to use one of the available memtest applications. There are commercial and free versions available. Free versions include:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://pyropus.ca/software/memtester/ although you may have to build the application yourself, otherwise download a pre-build version. I have used this to check newly-installed memory.\n\n*http://www.memtest86.com/ offers a free download although you need to create a CD from this and boot from it to use the application.\n\n\nand for a cheap, commercial alternative:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.memtestosx.org/joomla/index.php\nIn addition to these, the Apple Hardware Test CD or DVD that comes with a new machine also has memory test options.\n\nA: I think this issue was due to a faulty memory DIMM. The original 1gig that came with the computer was starting to give in, I determined this by first removing the 2gig DIMM (3rd party memory installed). The computer then worked for a few hours without any hassles, but the hanging started up again after I did some stuff on it. I then switched the 1gig for the 3rd party 2gig, and then started up without any problems or hangs. I presume the 1gig was starting to give in and that was what was causing all the beach balls and hangs.\nThanks for all the suggestions. But I hope this was the issue, as I'm no longer having any issues.\n", "Q: What tiny thing in iOS 5 makes you smile, or has caught you off guard? iOS 5 is here!

These icons can only generally be seen on Apple computers, iPhone users, or most Japanese Cell Phones (albeit they will look quite a bit different on those).\n\n\nA: Double tapping the home button on the lock screen shows you both media controls, and a camera icon to the right of the unlock swiping track. Not only is the Camera available from the lock screen, but as soon as you push the home button, it whisks you right back to the lock screen. So nobody can get into your iPhone without unlocking it.\n\n\nA: More convenient \"Find On Page\" searching\nI just noticed that when you're in Safari, and you click in the Search box at the top-right, the keyboard has a new \"Find on Page\" box, that is much more convenient than the old iOS 4 way of searching.\n\nEdit: 20/10/2011\nThe Pad Gadget page iPad Quick Tip – Find Text and Keywords in Mobile Safari shows a screenshot from the iOS 4 days. Notice how the \"On this page\" bit appears after it's searched the Web. My point is that the iOS 5 way is more obvious, and more convenient.\n\nA: Mass Mark as Read/Unread/Flag\nYou can now mark multiple emails as Read/Unread from the edit mode in Mail without having to open each message.\n\n\nA: Ringtones (can) Serve Double Duty as Notification Tones\nRingtones that are less than 15 seconds will also show up in the the various other notification types. \nNew (SMS) Message, Calendar Alerts, Tweet Sent, etc. They can even be defined as the SMS tone for a specific contact in your Address Book.\n\nA: Rename Your iOS Device\nI can change my iPod's name without using a computer. \nSilly I know, but I can.\nSettings.app > General > About > Name\n\n\n\n\nA: Bluetooth Volume Control, and Bluetooth Text Display\nSimply that the volume control on my stereo bluetooth headphones now actually controls the volume of my iPod Touch - AND the currently playing track is displayed on the Bluetooth module.

Now you can add one or more email addresses to the FaceTime section in Settings to enable people to FaceTime you at those addresses. You can also configure the Caller ID to be either the phone number or any of the email addresses - useful to prevent people you FaceTime with from getting your phone number.\nYou also have the same flexibility with iMessage as well, the ability to send and receive messages from either your phone number of any number of email addresses.\n \n\nA: More dash types\nTap and hold the dash on the keyboard now gives an en–dash (in addition to the -hyphen, em—dash and bullet •).

However, I screwed up.\nAnd I don't have a single backup, so now, all I have is a copy of the contacts on her computer, and no real contacts.\nDo any of you know how to fix this? Restore the old data?\n\nA: Check if she's stored the contacts anywhere else, such as in Hotmail, Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.  You can pull them into the phone by linking an account in Settings, Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Add Account..., or you can synchronize with the PC by going through the iPhone options in iTunes.\nOtherwise, start typing...\n", "Q: Is there a way to restore the iPhone's oleophobic screen coating once it's worn off? My iPhone 4 is about 15 months old now and the screen has completely lost the oleophobic property is had when it was new: finger smears now show up just like they do on other phones. Contrary to the comments on this question I've never cleaned it with any sort of solution: all it's ever had is the occasional wipe with a cotton cloth (well, T-shirt :), although of course it will also have been rubbed in the pocket of my jeans. It's never had a screen protector but is completely unscratched and undamaged.\nSo it seems the coating does wear off over time without using any kind of chemical agent. My question is, is it possible (either at Apple, a third-party service centre or at home) to re-apply it and get the screen back to its fresh-from-the-box state?\n\nA: There is a product called Fusso oleophobic coating (available here), that promises to restore the oleophobic properties of your iPhone display (there is also a tablet version)\nI personally haven't tried it, but the website ifixit.com, specialists on repairing Apple products, say that the product works really well.\n\nA: No. The organic material is applied during assembly. I'm not aware of any place that can \"replenish\" the lipophobic substance.\nApple has this to say:\n\"Please note that the ability of this coating to repel oil will diminish over time with normal usage, and that rubbing the screen with an abrasive material will further diminish its effect and may scratch your screen.\"\nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3226\nYou can, however look into replacement covers that also contain lipophobic properties: http://www.mobimega.com/sgp-steinheil-ultra-oleophobic-screen-protector-for-iphone-4.html\nOr pay for a new glass screen. Warranty will generally not cover this, but you can always ask for a quote from Apple service in or out of coverage. \n\nA: use car wax polish and gently polish the screen, it gives the same effect, and it is cheap.\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?s=059e3575c381d397e68881210a09255f&t=2232790&page=2\n\nA: No, no, and absolutely no, it can't be replaced. If you are lucky, best you can do for oleophopic coating is to try not to scratch it by being very careful to start out with .\nI have a HX850 Sony Bravia hdtv thats 4 years old. I keep the set in a theatre room mancave that nobody goes into without me being in there. I have terrible ocd, and notice every blemish on ANY of my av equipment. I have went to huge extent to protect things. I went to sleep one evening and awoke the next day to find, to my horror,  a huge scratch in my oleophopic coating running from the top to bottom on my screen. The set has gorilla glass, and the glass itself has not been compromised, but the repellent coating was.\nI was dumbfounded when I discovered this, as there was literally nobody in the room to cause the issue. \nWas it a mouse falling off the top of my set, scraping teeth and claws to try and stop the decent? Was it a vengeful ghost or spirit messing with me?    Strange things have been known to happen in the room from time to time. God only knows what in the Hell transpired.\nIm telling you, I was, and still am LIVID.\nI got desperate after three days of staring at the scratch. It was, and still is, really only noticeable in certain lighting conditions, but I notice, I know it's there, and it is enough to run me out of my anal mind. \nI bought a oleophopic kit from Japan, it came in the post in about a week. I applied it, and followed the instructions given, and it failed to work. I got desperate and used toothpaste, and it did not work. I tried Vaseline, it didnt work. I'm pretty sure at this stage, the sets just screwed.\nThe only other thing that might work, but very highly unlikely, is Novus polish kit and scratch remover. With this stuff you run the risk of removing even more coating though. It's made more for plastic based materials, but can be used on coated glass in some instances.\nI don't want to keep casting money to the wind to try and repair what seems impossible, at least without factory based machines. I say the layer is some baked on deal, and beyond standard consumer repair.\nDont be fooled, if your touch screen devices have gorilla glass, it doesnt mean they are scratch-proof, the glass might not scratch easy, but that damnable coating will, it defeats the purpose, and from my experience, it's un-replaceable. Warrenty won't cover it either on most devices. The best I got from Sony was a deal to send them the tv for trade in value of 25% off a new tv. Really sucks.\nWith a phone or tablet, ABSOLUTELY use a screen protector, no matter what Tom, Dick, or Harry tells you at your local electronics store. They are there to make a quick sale, they don't care about your scratched screen. Especially when it means you'll more than likely replace the entire device if need be whilst adding even more cash in their pockets. \nGracefully, I'm sure the corporate fat cats that came up with the idea of worthless oleophopic coating to start with are laughing all the way to the bank.\nNothing stays new forever, even if you baby it, but this is unacceptable. \n\nA: From what I've gathered through research on this topic, it is either hard to restore the oleophobic coating or there is a lack of good empirical evidence as to whether current solutions work. For example, there are some coatings available that you can apply to the screen, but I have not seen any popular videos or mega comment threads that confirm that these products work.\nI have thought about using such coatings myself, but thankfully I haven't been in the situation where the fingerprints have been enough of an issue for me to buy an oleophobic coating kit. If I end up buying one, I'll post another answer giving my thoughts on the product.\nI have a different answer though. The simplest way to prevent the oleophobic coating from wearing off (or indeed, if it has already worn off to prevent fingerprints from showing up) is by using a sacrificial screen, aka a screen protector. You can find many screen protectors that have oleophobic coatings. Fingerprints wipe off them really easily. When the screen protector's coating starts wearing off, you can simply replace it. This is a cheap and cost-effective way of having a fingerprint-free phone screens. I've found the 2 for $9 screen protectors to work remarkably well.\n", "Q: Want to post an iphone 4 video on youtube, but it needs to be rotated I filmed something with my iphone 4 by rotating the phone so that it looks wide.  Like a widescreen TV.  But when I upload the .mov to youtube, the video is sideways and tall & skinny.  How do I rotate it?  Is there a setting in iPhoto or quicktime I can configure?  Or on youtube?\nI'm surprised, Apple always makes things so easy... I would've imagined the camera software would recognize I started filming rotated and saved the picture as such...\n\nA: *\n\n*Quicktime allows you some basic editing options such as Edit > Rotate\n\n*iMovie allows more options such as cropping, rotate, trim, etc.\nWhen you view your video in Quicktime is it in landscape format? If not, it's possible the phone was vertical (portrait) when the recording started.

Then on Friday when my iPhone 4S arrived I transferred everything over. The phone works great and all the core apps work fine, but none of the 3rd party apps work at all. They \"blink\" if I click on them but none of them will launch - even ones that have just been updated. I have a couple of key apps with years worth of data that I really can't afford to lose.  I have done a hard reset. I have restored the software and restored from backup and still the problem is the same.\nAny suggestions as to why this is happening and more importantly how I can resolve it?\nThanks.\n\nA: Thanks for the suggestions but here is the answer:\n\nThe reason this happens is because every time a downloaded app is opened it checks for your itunes password for validation that you are authorized to open that app (as it may contain personal info). From time to time the iphone “forgets” your itunes password. You can fix the missing password by syncing the iphone with itunes or downloading an app from the app store and entering your password that way.\n\nI am up and running with all my 3rd party apps now.\n\nA: install another app from the app store... a free one will do. and then once you install that, then all of your apps will start working.. :) hope this helps\n\nA: When they blink that is the system trying to start them but then they immediately crash.  But I don't know why.\nIf you can't run any third party apps this suggestion probably won't work, but if you can download and run the Console app from iTunes you can look at the system logs and see why your apps are crashing.  That may help find a solution.\nAnother option is to install XCode onto your Mac and in the Organizer window you can see the system logs and crash logs on your Mac.  Knowing what's wrong might help find a solution.\n", "Q: Using iCloud on Leopard with iPhone 4 I am on Leopard 10.5.8 (my MacBook is too old to upgrade to Snow Leopard) on itunes 10.5, and on iPhone 4 (iOS 5.0). \nI have a MobileMe account.\nMy iPhone shows iCloud is available in the settings but I don't think I have signed up yet. Should I/can I move my MobileMe to iCloud and still be able to sync my phone to my mac?

I have both a PowerPC Mac Pro and an Intel MacBook Pro. For my PowerPC Mac the highest OS I can go is Leopard, and I do not see any option for iCloud for it. If there is, I would really like to use it, but I've searched and haven't found anything yet. MobileMe will be discontinued sometime in June or July 2012, hence, all PowerPC Macs will be without MobileMe or iCloud. They're being left behind.\nTo answer your other question, Apple is offering upgrades to iCloud, and you will not lose any of your data. You can keep your @me.com email address (iCloud uses the same @me.com address anyway, even if you're new). I have even been able to keep my @mac.com address from several years ago, back when it was dot-Mac (.mac).

Give this page a look. Several frustrated commenters.\nMacworld Review\n", "Q: Iphone \"shortcuts\" for wifi / 3g / localization the iPhone may be a real battery hog and sometimes having the battery last till evening is hard. The obvious tips are turning localization, bluetooth, wifi, 3g and so on off. The problem is that this requires a lot of tipping. For example, if I just want to turn 3g off because i'm not browsing or something, I have to tap Activate -> Unlock -> Setting -> General -> Network -> 3g.\nOne really cool feature of Android is that you can simply swipe down (the gesture that in the new iOS 5 shows the center message) and you have all the icons for turning features on / off. Moreover, every mobile phone has different \"modes\" that you can activate with a few clicks and that encapsulate a set of settings. On the iPhone you just have sound on / off and the radical \"aeroplane\" mode.\nIs there a way (shortcut, setting, app...) to set up different modes? For example, most of the times I just need to use the iPhone for messages and calls and receive pushes (mails) but not using 3g, but I want to reactivate all the features if I need to look up something on the internet or check something nearby with an app and I don't want to do dozens of clicks just to reactivate the localization, searching for networks and re-enable 3g. Thanks\n\nA: Yes, Apple has added some URL shortcuts for these functions and Jeff Broderick (blog at http://brdrck.me/ ) has assembled a nice dashboard of these shortcuts with gorgeous icons to save the web clips to the home screen of your iOS device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Wifi toggle from http://brdrck.me/settings/wifi\nSimply browse your iOS device to http://brdrck.me/settings/ and pick from the many web clips that he has assembled. These are basically the same as taking a web site in the iPhone configuration utility and adding it to your home screen with a nice icon. I don't see one set up for Localization/International or 3G but will poke around to see if I can figure out the syntax to get those sorted for you.\n\nA: I discovered this question while looking for the same answer. Unfortunately there is no way to do this unless you jailbreak your device.\nOnce jailbroken, a large set of toggles in notification center and also three profiles are provided by the free application called \"batterydoctorpro\" made by the Chinese guys who made \"Battery Doctor (Battery Saver,Battery Life)\" in app store (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battery-doctor-battery-saver/id446751279?mt=8)\nIt is amazing to compare the programs side by side to see just how many features is Apple restricting users from having.\n\"Made in China\" in this case is a high quality code stamp.\nTo not be accused of publicity, there are also others worth mentioning: ncsettings, sbsettings (and maybe others if you search for \"notification center toggles\"); I've went through testing of some of them but b-d-p is my subjective personal recommendation because of really good impression.\n\nA: The short cut for stopping 3G is easy.

Has anyone tried to get Colloquy to work with Google Talk? Have searched online, but couldn't find any useful articles.\nPS. Not sure if this is the right place to ask for such a question.\n\nA: I'm afraid it's not going to work. Colloquy is a client for the IRC protocol (also SILC and ICB, both of which are rarely used). Google Talk uses XMPP (aka Jabber) for its text chat, which Colloquy doesn't support.\nIf you want a 3rd party client for Google Talk, anything that supports XMPP/Jabber will do, but keep in mind this works only for the text chat.

Check the box next to \"Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi.\" Now it should automatically sync wirelessly when connected to a power source within range; or, you can manually sync wirelessly through the Settings > General > iTunes Wi-Fi Sync menu.\nI also was under the impression this was automatic, but I guess it makes sense to have it as an option.\n", "Q: Where is the sender name for iMessages set? I need to change it on an iPhone 4 (iOS 5) The sender id as it displays on the recipients iMessage is what I would like to reset. However, I cannot find where it is set on the sending device (iPhone 4). It seems to be device dependent as sending iMessages from my iPad 2 displays a different sender name although both devices use the same Appleid.\n\nA: I hope I understood your question correctly. Try this: go to settings>>messages>>caller id. Choose the email address that is associated with the name you want the recipients to see\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that it's set in the contact for that person's AppleID/Email Address. Take a look in that persons info in Contacts.app.\n", "Q: Spotlight can't find m4a files I used to use Spotlight to directly start iTunes at a track I wanted to listen to by searching for it.  However since upgrading to Lion I've not been able to do this with .m4a music files (mp3s still work).  They never show up in spotlight even if I type their name exactly.  Has something broken in Spotlight in Lion?  \n\nA: Try opening up the Spotlight Preferences and re-ordering the position \"Music\" by dragging it higher up in the list. In Lion when you search via Spotlight it prioritizes the most relevant items according to the order you see in the Spotlight Preference Pane. \nAnother thing that will save you some frustration is to do a Spotlight search (any file will do) and select \"Show All in Finder\", from there select \"Show View Options\" and change Arrange by to \"None\" and Sort by to \"Name\".\nIf those two things don't work then I would recommend rebuilding your index. (Do I need to re-index my Volume?)\n\n\n\nA: Could it be you installed the 10.7.2 update before Spotlight started working for you again?\nThe m4a/AAC Spotlight importer was broken in early versions of Mac OS X Lion. It just would not pick up any song metadata. Since 10.7.2 it seems to work again.\n", "Q: Is there a timeline for Siri location features to be brought to Canada? Currently, the location features for Siri don't work in Canada. Is there a timeline for that being rolled out, or is there any way to get around it?  \n\nA: Apple announced that Siri location services will come to Canada and several other countries when iOS 6 is released in the fall.\nYou can see the full list of supported languages and locations here.\n", "Q: Why does my Macbook automatically open a browser Window at Starbucks?

After all I don't get the same effect with my Ubuntu-computer or my Android phone.\n\nA: This is a new feature of OS X Lion.\nLion automatically opens a web browser window when it detects that you need to agree to terms and conditions or log in to use the Internet.\nIt's worth mentioning that the window isn't actually Google Chrome, but an operating system window that includes a WebKit-based browser.\n", "Q: Contact's numbers not formatted correctly on my Verizon iPhone 4S I setup my Verizon iPhone 4S by restoring from a backup of my 3GS.\nNow my contact's phone numbers aren't formatted at all.

I have an iPhone 4S and some V-Moda in-ear headphones. The headphones have great volume and isolation, which is good when I'm listening to something quiet. But it's a problem on my iPhone.\nWhen I play music on my iPhone with the headphones, it is very loud. As in, painfully loud when I put the volume slider in the middle. To  lower the volume, I (of course) dragged the volume slider to the left. The problem is that even when I get all the way to the left, it is still very loud. If I move it any further, the volume abruptly mutes.\n\nI've tried changing settings, and I've found that enabling Sound Check helps some louder songs. Unfortunately, Sound Check doesn't apply to apps like Spotify, which I use more than the Music app.\n\nSo, how can I reduce the volume on my iPhone beyond the slider?\nNotes: The volume is fine with the stock Apple headphones. Reducing the volume of the music itself (modifying the files) isn't an option because I need to reduce the volume of streaming audio and files I don't have access to (Spotify).\n\nA: I’m on iOS 12.1.2, iPhone X\nCan’t find Volume Limit in the Settings. \nI have 3 Bluetooth sound bars, different models, and all three are way too loud on lowest volume (1). Going lower brings it to (0) and mutes them. Controlling the sound from the sound bars changes the iPhone volume, to same effect.\nBut I found a way to control the volume in fine increments between the 0 and 1 range. \nOn the iPhone Control Center, “3D” press (long press?) the volume control, which opens a bigger version of it, almost full screen. Now you have very fine control between the former steps. It,s like 100 volume substeps between “0/mute” and “1/loud”. \nThe “1” i reference is relative as there are no marks on that slider, and pressing the up/down volume buttons moves it to different levels actually, I.e going from 0 one up is not the same as going one down from 2. \nIn any event, using the touch screen you can finely adjust the volume on the big slider all the way down to barely audible. It’s clunky, still chances to blow your hearing, but it works.\n\nA: There's a plist you can edit to raise or reduce the amplification of the volume on a jailbroken device, however your question has the iphone-4s tag, so I'm assuming you're using a 4S, which means it won't be possible until a jailbreak is released for it. \niJailbreak has a tutorial of how to do this, but this should be easier:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download iFile from Cydia. \n\n*Open iFile and keep pressing the back arrow until the title bar says /.\n\n*Navigate to /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Celestial.framework (MobileToolbox.framework on iOS 5)\n\n*Tap ReigonalVolumeLimits.plist, followed by Property List Viewer.\n\n*Set every value on the right to one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*0,83 (default)\n\n*25 (125% of the original volume)\n\n*0,43 (43% of the original volume)\n\n\n(Don't use 1, as it is known to use more battery life.)\n\n*Save your changes to the file.\n\n*Either respring or reboot your device and the volume level will change.\n\n\nYou might not hear a difference through the phone's speaker, but you should when you use an external audio output.\nIf you don't want to jailbreak, you can also try playing music while changing the equalizer settings to one you like. I'm not sure if this has an effect on apps other than the stock ones, though.\n\nA: I found a few solutions to this using the Shortcuts app.\nThe simple approach:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new shortcut\n\n*For Action, choose \"Media\" --> \"Set Volume\" (red loudspeaker icon)\n\n*Setting the volume to 5% seems to make a big difference.  Songs are a lot quieter but still audible.  You can only do increments of 1%, however (no decimal values).\n\nA more customizable approach:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new shortcut\n\n*Add \"Get Numbers from Input\"\n\n*Add \"Set variable\" which takes the number input and assigns it to a variable\n\n*Add \"Set Volume\".  Long-press on where it says \"50%\" and change it to use your variable.\n\n*When you run it, you'll be prompted for the volume level.  Use a decimal value, like .05 (which is equivalent to 5%).  Entering anything 1.0 or higher will set the volume to 100%.\n\nFYI you can also create a shortcut that gets the current volume (from Get Device Details) and speaks it.  It will be a percentage expressed as a decimal (6% is .06).\n\nA: I had the same issue. I went into settings, music, EQ and adjusted the Loudness setting. It is now softer / not as loud sounding. \n\nA: Ok, so I finally have an answer of sorts! It's a hack, but... basically, you can create a custom EQ that simply lowers all frequencies by the same amount, which is the same as lowering the volume. \nStep 1: Make your customer EQ in iTunes: Open up iTunes. Select Window > EQ. Then reduce the preamp volume (on the left hand side) to super low. If you want even more reduction, take each little slider, and reduce it real low, but make sure each one is reduced the exact same amount, or else you'll slightly alter the tone of the songs.\nStep 2: Get that custom EQ onto your iPod!: Follow these instructions exactly from a different forum question: http://www.head-fi.org/t/399487/ipod-custom-eq-yes-it-can-be-done\nThen when you want to reduce the volume of every song, just go (on your iPod) to Settings > EQ, and select your EQ setting! Boom!\n\nA: There's no easy way to do this by standard means of iOS (current fresh iOS v.9.3.1), without \"jailbreaking\" and intruding to the inner-workings of iOS.\nHeadsets with wire\nIf are using headsets with wire, then we can blame higher/lower impedance difference in the headphones. High-impedance headsets would require higher signal levels to produce the same output level of low-impedance headphones.\nThe easiest solution you can do, would be to buy a volume attenuator, which would have a little dial on adapter itself for adjusting the level.\nBluetooth headset, wireless\nBut if you gotten Bluetooth headset, wireless, it works differently. Headset controls the volume level in \"electronic-way\", so it totally dependent on implementation of headsets and is dependent from manufacturer to manufacturer. The minimum volume would vary seriously depending on the model of BT-headset.\nI might propose to go the same way, to buy external Bluetooth adapter, which will get analogue signal, convert it to digital over BT, and will have different settings for the volume range. I understand, that this approach is not easy to use and has its drawbacks, so I'd not recommend to go this way, unless you are really annoyed. \n\nTheoretically, you may play a bit with EQ settings in your iPhone (Settings -> Music -> Playback section), this might soften a bit the sound, but it barely affects the minimum volume level, it will just create the different perception, a bit milder sound.\nI'm not sure, if there are existing Apps for adjusting EQ + master volume control, I think no-one is using them on iPhone/iPod.\n\nA: I tried Volume master app ($0.99)\nIt says it increases the volume by 0.01dB - 0dB, 0.01dB, 0.02dB, etc while the default iPhone volume control goes from 0dB, 0.06dB, etc. I am not sure 0.01dB is low enough or it works with any app.\nIt feels a bit comfortable with 0.01dB even though I cannot tell the difference a lot between 0.06dB and 0.01dB. \n\nA: I have active speakers without volume controls and stream via bluetooth.  The only way I have found to reduce the minimum volume is to get the Denon Audio app (free), then purchase the in app equaliser (£1.49), set the eq to flat and reduce all frequencies.  This can be saved as a custom setting.\nI've tried the volume app and other EQs - they don't work. \n\nA: If you set the volume to the lowest, then set the volume limit to the lowest possible, you will find the volume bar will be at maximum again. Just drag it all the way down and the volume will be much lower. HTH!\n\nA: I tip a 4 pole jack volume splitter control, das does really the job without changing anything the volume control of the iPhone. If you do good the iPhone also limited at aproximately 80dB. They have 4 pole so iPhone remote can still used. You can verry low sound volume with these.\nOfcourse you can use 3 pole volume control, but then you can not using the Apple remote.\nGoogle on\nLindy 3.5mm Stereo Headphone Splitter Cable with Volume Control\nor\nHeadphone Audio Jack Splitter With Separate Volume Controls\nor \nDausen Smart Headphone Splitter\nor\nGreen Connection White Headphone Splitter with Separate Volume Controls\nor\nMonoprice 107116 Headphone Splitter with Separate Volume Controls\n\nA: There's a very simple solution for your problem.\nGo to 'settings' > 'Music' > Volume Limit. There you can limit the maximum volume. How lower the maximum volume, how smaller the increased or decreased volume difference when you click on the volume rocker.\n", "Q: iCloud and Document & Data Syncing Does anyone know if iCloud backs up ALL of your files (including files outside of the Documents folder AND even the stuff outside of your user directory /Users/USERNAME) or only the ones inside of the Documents folder (So Downloads, Movies, Music , Desktop and Library are out of the question).\nIf it backs up everything then does anyone know how to configure it to only backup your Documents folder?\n\nA: iCloud does not backup all of your data. It's more a replacement of iWork.com sharing in previous (or current?) versions of iWork. It only works with applications that specifically support iCloud:\n\nIf you have the same iCloud-enabled apps on more than one device, iCloud automatically keeps your documents up to date across all your devices. So you don’t have to.\n\nIf you visit http://icloud.com and click the ? link, you'll be sent to the help site, which states:\n\nDocuments in the Cloud overview\niCloud keeps your documents up to date across all your iOS devices and on icloud.com. Every time you edit a Keynote, Pages, or Numbers document on your iOS device, your changes are automatically available on your other iOS devices set up with iCloud and on the web at icloud.com.\n\nThis also explains why the iCloud site does not show a generic documents section in the overview, only iWork. Of course, developers are free to support iCloud in their own applications.\n\nThe supported file types are listed here:\n\nYou can also drag and drop a new iWork ‘09 (Keynote, Pages, and Numbers) or Microsoft Office (PowerPoint, Word, and Excel) document from your computer to icloud.com, and then access the document from Keynote, Pages, or Numbers on your iOS device set up with iCloud. Supported file types include Keynote ‘09, Pages ‘09, Numbers ‘09, PowerPoint, Word, Excel, .txt, and .csv.\n\n", "Q: What happens after an iOS magazine subscription is canceled? Now that iOS 5 has been released and devices now have the 'Newsstand' feature, I've been considering switching over some of my print magazine subscriptions to the iPad platform.\nDoes anyone know what happens to your existing issues after an iOS magazine subscription is canceled?  After downloading the \"free\" app for a magazine (such as PC Gamer), you have the choice of either buying individual issues at a high price or \"subscribing\" on either a monthly or annual basis.  The subscription can be stopped at any time (and will expire at the end of the current paid period.)\nAfter the subscription is stopped, can you continue to access the issues that you received during the paid subscription (and, importantly, will you still have access to them using the 'Restore paid issues' option on a new device even if you don't have a then-current subscription)?  Or do you lose all access to the issues after the subscription payments stop? (I'm really hoping that's not how it works, but it wouldn't surprise me.  I think it should work like a paper magazine; i.e. when your subscription ends, the issues on your shelf don't spontaneously combust...)\n\nA: From a technical perspective your subscription is only valid as long as you're paying for it. After that Apple's servers return the same response for you, as they would if you had never subscribed. \nYou will probably still keep access to all your issues, although restoring old issues has to be implemented by the app itself. For example wired magazine requires you to create a wired account to later restore all magazines. (But even without the account you can keep your downloaded issues as long as you want. I expect that to be standard across other magazines as well - but again, that's up to the publisher.)\n", "Q: Does iTunes WiFi sync communicate with the Internet? When I use WiFi sync using my wireless router, is the data transfer completely in local network OR does it happen over the internet to iCloud or another service? Will the bandwidth used be deducted by my service provider?\n\nA: If you iPhone talks to the internet while connected to WiFi, then yes, it costs your home internet bandwidth.  If it talks to the internet outside of of WiFi range, it costs your mobile internet bandwidth.\nSyncing your phone with iTunes does not use the internet, it only uses the local network.  If your phone is configured to sync with iCloud, then it is using the internet. \n", "Q: What are the physical differences between an iPhone 4S and an iPhone 4? I'm wondering what physically has changed between the CDMA iPhone 4 / GSM iPhone 4 and the new iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*\n\n*the placement or number of bands interrupting the metal side case\n\n*micro SIM slot location\n\n*camera and LED opening / placement\n\n*home button\n\n*receiver / front camera / proximity sensor placement\n\n\nSuperficially, the buttons on the 4S seem to align with the CDMA model spacing as opposed to the GSM spacing\nI ask to know and for the practical application of people that want to reuse a precision case or protective film are going to find differences. I'm looking for first hand knowledge or reports of people taking a micrometer to the shipping hardware and doing a comparison.\n\nA: The iFixit Teardown says that it has the same front panel (i.e. same positions for the Home button, LCD, sensors and earpiece). Other sites have also confirmed that it's the same layout as the CDMA iPhone 4.\nIt should work with any case made for the CDMA iPhone 4, and some of the less precise GSM iPhone 4 cases (i.e. ones with large cutouts around the buttons). It should also work with any Apple bumper purchased from January on, as those were designed to work with the GSM & CDMA iPhone 4.\nThe 4S also has 4 symmetrically positioned black strips (gaps between the antenna segments), 2 on each side, just like the CDMA 4. It also has a GSM slot, which is pretty much the only distinguishing feature between the CDMA 4 and the 4S.\n\nA: I just purchased a case for the iPhone 4S and the volume rockers seem to be closer to the loud/vibrate switch. It does not align. I also used the GSM iPhone 4 prior to this unaware that there were physical differences from the CMDA model. Everything else seems to be in alignment but the spacing of the left-side controls are different.\n\nA: You're right in that the iPhone 4S pretty much resembles the CDMA iPhone 4 in terms of volume/mute button placement.\nkapowaz.net has a comparison of button placement on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S which might be of help. Though I'm afraid I can't offer micrometer accuracy.\n\nA: Not sure if this was the case on the CDMA iPhone 4, but the vibration ringer on the iPhone 4S has been changed. It's stronger and vibrates at a higher frequency. \n\nA: Based on my experience with cases, it appears that the headphone jack is in a different place on the new iPhone.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of extra \"Photo Stream\" album on iPhone? On my iPhone (and iPad) I have \"Photo Stream\" enabled for my primary Apple ID (I have others setup for mail, etc).\nOn my iPad it works fine - I see the one \"Photo Stream\" button and everything shows up there. \nOn my iPhone (iPhone 4) there are two \"Photo Stream\" albums for some reason. One is the correct one with my pictures, and one is blank and when I go into it there is just the message that explains what the stream is and says \"No Photos\".\nIf I disable \"Photo Stream\" temporarily on the phone the album disappears with my pictures, but the blank album remains.\nHow can I get rid of this blank album?\n\nA: Yes, you can ! You have to turn it back on, take a picture and wait for it to upload to iCloud. Then you turn it off and and confirm the warning that says that all the pictures will be deleted. The album will then disappear.\n", "Q: How Can I Restart in Windows Using a Script? I'd like to be able to reboot into the Boot Camp partition without needing to go change the Startup Disk in System Preferences or holding down the Option key at startup.\nAfter reading some stuff on the Internet, I tried these shell commands:\nsudo bless --mount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP --setBoot\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nWhen the system restarted, it sat on the blank gray screen for a while, then booted into Mac OS X.  If I go into System Preferences -> Startup Disk, it indicates that BOOTCAMP is the current startup disk.\nSo, it looks to me like the bless command I used isn't sufficient. Anybody know what I need to do to make this work, or an alternative way to use a shell script or AppleScript to do this?\n\nA: This works just using applescript. replace login_password with your login password.\nAlso make sure the path to BOOTCAMP is correct (it should be). Save as an application and open it when you want to reboot into BootCamp. This is two lines of code...\ndo shell script \"bless -mount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/ -legacy -setBoot -nextonly\" password \"login_password\" with administrator privileges\ndo shell script \"shutdown -r now\" password \"login_password\" with administrator privileges\n", "Q: Why does iCloud have a different timezone for my calendar events than my devices do? I set an appointment on iCal from 19:30 to 22:00. In the iCloud calendar it shows as 18:30 to 21:00. In iCal on Macbook Pro, on iPhone 4S and iPad 2 it shows the correct time i.e. 19:30 to 22:00!\nI have timezone support switched off and I have the UK as the timezone. How can it be that iCloud (where the devices get the times from) is showing incorrect times, yet all the devices are showing the correct time?\nHas anyone else experienced this problem?\n\nA: Each of your devices has a timezone setting, which you probably already set correctly.\nWhat you probably didn't know is that iCloud.com has its own timezone setting. To access it, login to icloud.com, then click on your name in the upper right corner. Once set, you should see everything ok.\nThe “time zone support” setting you disabled has to do with creating events associated with a timezone, and is usually better left off.\nNOTE: Once you change this you will have to logout and then login again for the changes to take effect.\n", "Q: How can I take a larger screenshot on my iPhone? I would like to take a screenshot of an entire web page in Mobile Safari, not just the part that's visible on the screen. I'm running iOS 5 on an iPhone 4, but I'm pretty sure this functionality isn't built in anywhere. What app or trick do I need?\n\nA: Natively available in iOS 13 and later\nThis functionality is now built into iOS 13 by Apple. Safari running in iOS 13 lets you screenshot the entire webpage as a single continuous image.\nTo do that, open the desired webpage in Safari, and simply take a screenshot as you would normally do on your device, and tap on the thumbnail shown immediately shown towards the bottom left.\nYou'll be presented with two options at the top in a segmented control:\n\n*\n\n*Screen\nand\n\n\n*Full Page\n \nWith the Full Page item selected, tap on the Share icon in the top right to share the capture via desired medium. AirDropping it for instance, exports a single PDF file, which can be easily exported into a desired image format.\n\n\nA: Webshot Free can do this (there's a 99¢ ad-free version too). It's supposed to let you just change http:// to webshot:// and it will open the same URL in in the app. That didn't work, but cut+paste did.\nThere may be other apps which are better for certain needs, depending on what you want to actually do with the page. If you just want a JPG or PNG of it, Webshot Free works fine.\nIf you are trying to save a page for reading later, iCab Mobile ($2, universal) will let you save a .webarchive or a .pdf file. [Note: the print to pdf function is actually provided by 3rd party webapps, but it's integrated into iCab].\nThere are a variety of \"Print to PDF\" apps in the app store, PrintBureau, seems to be one of the better ones (and is universal).\n\nA: This question has been asked on StackOverflow.\nWebpage Capture ($2.39, demo, confirmed on SO) or Website Screenshot ($0.99) should do the trick.\nI have not tested any of them.\n\nAs a side note: since Safari for Mac itself doesn't do full page export*, it really doesn't come as a surprise there's no way to do so on iOS.\n*yes, of course you can print as PDF, but that's completely different from saving a full-dimensioned, not-paginated, not-styled-for-print version of the website (for which a third-party app such as LittleSnapper is necessary)\n\nA: Tailor (App Store link) is a free app that does this extremely easily by detecting sequential screenshots in your iOS device’s Photos and stitching them together automatically. \n\nA: It's not ideal obviously, but if you need a shot of the page exactly as it appears on the phone, your best bet is to scroll around the page, taking a series of screen shots and manually stitch them together on a PC.\nPrinting to a PC as a PDF is an alright idea, as is setting your desktop Safari to send the iPhone user-agent, but neither will give you perfect renderings of what it looks like on the iPhone, often there will be substantial formatting differences.\n\nA: Webpage Capture for iPhone | iPad\nFrom the iTunes description:\n\nWebpage Capture enables you to take a screenshot of the complete\n  webpage you are browsing. You can then save it, email it or share it\n  on Social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Flickr. Saving as PDF\n  enables you to archive your files and access them for off-line reading\n  and for record-keeping.\nThis version also enables you to export pdf files to iBooks,\n  Evernote...and any other app you have for reading pdf files.\nThe app captures the complete webpage whether visible or not as an\n  image instead of HTML. This is useful for keeping track of pages\n  visited, keeping a log of dynamic pages, for storing information (eBay\n  auctions, digital magazine, digital newspapers...) or for later\n  reading or for sharing with somebody somewhere that cannot access a\n  webpage. \nThe screenshot can be saved on the device itself and can also be\n  transferred via iTunes File Share.\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Launch Mobile Safari on devices running iOS5. \n\n*Type the URL of the website of interest.\n\n*After the web page is done loading, touch the gray Reader \"button\"\nto the right of the URL address.\n\n*Mobile Safari is now in \"Reader\" mode (note the purple text color), select the  icon and choose \"Mail this Article\". Provide a valid email address.  The entire web page\n(photos, text, etc) including portions not visible or not displayed\nwill be appended into the email message you're composing.\n\n*Launch your email browser to verify.

The Expert and Turbo versions had slightly different coloring, and each came in wired and wireless versions.\n\n\n*\n\n*K64213 Expert Mouse Pro \n\n*K64214 Turbo Mouse Pro\n\n*K64245 Expert Mouse Pro Wireless\n\n*K64240 Turbo Mouse Pro Wireless\n\n\nThe good news:\nAccording to Kensington's drivers page, TrackballWorks™ 1.1 for Mac was released on Oct 19, 2011.\n[Note: yes, that's TrackballWorks, not MouseWorks—the latter was last updated in 2009.] \nThe Installation/Notes file says:\n\nRequirements:\n  Apple OSX 10.5.6 Leopard\n  Apple OSX 10.6.x Snow Leopard\n  Apple OSX 10.7.x Lion  \nDescription: Enables trackball customization: button functions, pointer speed and acceleration, and scrolling speed and direction.  \nLanguages: English  \nInstallation:\n  Save the DMG file to your desktop and double-click on it.\n  Click on the installer package icon when it appears.\n  Follow the on-screen instructions to install the software.\n\nThe bad news:\nI haven't been able to get it to work, and I'm not the only one.\nKensington support says: \n\nTrackballWorks - Supported Kensington Devices\nWhich Kensington trackball models are compatible with the software application TrackballWorks?\nKensington TrackballWorks is compatible with SlimBlade TrackBall model K72327, Expert Mouse model K64325, Orbit Trackball w/Scroll Ring model 72337, and Orbit Optical Trackball K64327.\n\nNote that all the supported models have numbers greater than K642nn.\nWorkarounds?\n\n\n*\n\n*There are some reports of success with TrackballWorks, so it's worth a try.\n\n*There are third-party mouse drivers. Some people have switched over to using USB Overdrive. I'm currently trying out SteerMouse, which makes the trackball work, but only has limited button support.\nNeither focuses on supporting Kensington devices, or trackballs in general, which makes things problematic.\n\nA: The Kensington Expert Mouse PRO and Lion do work together, including all 6 DIRECT LAUNCH buttons and the 4 mouse buttons around the track ball. I haven't figured out how to get the scroll wheel to work, but that can most likely work as well. \nYou do NOT need the Kensington software in order to make it work either. My solution was to use Keyboard Maestro purchased from their web site (it doesn't work with the sandboxed version from the App Store). Even then you have to add a .5 second pause between commands and use TYPE IT instead of pasting when inserting text.\nAs an example let's create a macro to assign a double click to the top right button of the track ball:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Keyboard Maestro\n\n*Click on the bottom left plus sign to add a Group.\n\n*Rename it to MACROS FOR ALL PROGRAMS. \n\n*Create a new macro by clicking the center plus sign for ADD MACRO.\n\n*Give it a name. I called mine DOUBLE CLICK.\n\n*If you look closely you will see a green plus sign with the command NEW TRIGGER. Click it to open a pull down menu. The second from the bottom option is DEVICE TRIGGER. You will be using this option for all the track ball functions to work.\n\n*Notice the blue box that shows up and says NONE. While it is blue, press the button that is the top right button of the track ball, or any button you want to become a double click on the Kensington Expert Mouse, (KEM). The word NONE is replaced with USB/PS2 WHEEL MOUSE BUTTON 5. Now, YOU ARE NOT DONE! \n\n*Just to the right, is a double arrow and next to it are the words that say IS PRESSED. Click on the words and change them to IS RELEASED. \n\n\nOK, you now have a button on the Expert Mouse programed, but it is doing nothing. Now you need to do your first action\n\n\n*\n\n*The first action must be a PAUSE. To put a pause in, click on the DISPLAY HIDE ACTION LIST plus sign at the bottom right plus sign. On the left, click on the folder called CONTROL FLOW. The list of actions the first item is PAUSE. double click it. Change the time from 1.5 seconds to .5 seconds. \n\n*In the Categories section click on INTERFACE CONTROL. In the center, double click on MOVE OR CLICK MOUSE. This action will show up in the right window. You need to make 4 changes here. Where it says CLICK, click on it and change it to DOUBLE CLICK. Where it says FRONT WINDOW'S TOP LEFT CENTER click on it and change it to CURRENT MOUSE LOCATION. And finally, click on bot box that says RESTORE MOUSE LOCATION. \n\n\nNow you are all done and can use the top right button to perform a double click.\nTo type text, or what ever, using the direct launch buttons, at the step for new trigger, push the direct launch button of your choice. Instead of a mouse click, insert an INSERT TEXT command and type your text. \n\nA: If you want to use this trackball with all its buttons with a huge selection of programmable functions (you will not get all the original functions, however) go get you a Mac & SteerMouse.  You can buy a used MacBook for the price some want for this trackball.\n", "Q: iMac going in and out of sleep every few seconds If I put my iMac (2011, i7) to sleep, it'll wake up after 5 seconds, then go back to sleep after a few seconds, and repeat constantly.

Could it be a hardware fault?\nThanks!\n\nA: Judging from your log, something on the USB bus is triggering the wake-up (and a similar issue I have found pointed to a defective Apple USB keyboard). As you have removed all hardware devices, my prime path of investigation would be drivers for any 3rd party USB devices (modem? scanner? graphics tablet?) and software that aims to extend the behavior of external devices (like BetterTouchTool, MagicPrefs, misc. and sundry).\n\nA: The infrared receiver is USB-based and can wake up your iMac. It may be receiving a signal from some device (e.g. a remote). Have you tried disabling it (System Preferences; Security & Privacy; General; Disable remote control infrared receiver)? \nIf this helps and you want to use an Apple remote you should pair it so no other remotes can wake up your iMac.\n\nA: After working on this issue, seems like the sensor for the monitor causes the system to behave this way, I disconnected the monitor sensor, i'm guessing it's a temperature sensor., and it seems to be working fine.\n", "Q: Make all fonts larger on the Macbook Air 11\" or 13\" Instead of getting a Macbook Pro 13\" or 15\", I was thinking of getting the Macbook Air 13\" or 11\", but checking the machines at Apple store, it turns out the density of pixels of the screen of the Macbook Air 11\" or 13\" is larger, so the font appears more \"dense\", and therefore smaller.\nIt turns out that the Macbook Pro 13\" has smaller pixel density, and the 15\" model has even smaller density, so they can have larger fonts, without needing to squint the eyes. The 17\" model also has high font density as well.\nIf I want to get the Macbook Air 13\", is there a way under Lion to make all the fonts larger (the webpage, the menu bar, all apps), without changing the resolution of the machine to something not the native resolution? (Native resolution is optimal on each machine.)\n\nA: The short answer is without deep hacking, no, you cannot make fonts larger in all applications and in the menu bar but not change from the native resolution.\nMany applications do have zoom features (including Safari, Finder, Address Book, Mail, etc.), but the way to make text larger in each app is, unfortunately, different from app to app.\n\nA: Go to \"Settings\", then click on \"Displays\" & change the Resolution to \"Best for display\", mine was stuck on \"Scaled\" after I had it hooked up to the TV. Personally, I think 1440x900 looks best on my laptop, but if you click \"Scaled\" then 1024x640 the general font will get even bigger.\n", "Q: On the Mac, what if Disk Utility is used to mirror two hard drives, one is 1.5TB, and the other is 2TB? If I happen to have two external hard drives, one 1.5TB and then other 2TB, and use Disk Utility to mirror the two drives, will there be any problem?\nCan it be mirroring just for the 1.5TB portion, while the remaining 500GB is for storing un-mirrored files?   (but will Mac OS X always try to mirror those files and try to copy into the 1.5TB drive?)\n(will it be the same if the two drives are 2TB and 3TB, or if the drives are different brands, so the capacity might differ slightly?)\n\nA: In this situation, I recommend using disk utility to partition the larger drive such that one partition matches the size of the smaller drive.  Then setup the partitions of the same size as a RAID1.  You will end up with a mirrored partition of 1.5TB and another un-mirrored partition of 0.5TB based on your first example.\nSame thing will work for a 2TB + 3TB drive, but the mirrored/un-mirrored partitions will be 2TB and 1TB, respectively.

Unfortunately, between snow leopard and upgraded internet browser, I have about 20 MB of free memory just when checking my email. Lots of loading time and spinning wheel (aka Steve Jobs' eternal flame).\nI've heard that since I have a dual core that I should always keep the two memory modules paired for best performance, which would make my best option two 1GB modules. But then I read on Crucial's website that the mid2007 macbook has a max of 3GB of memory, and that the an upaired set of 1GB and 2GB would be better than two 1 GB.\nOn a related note, will I notice a big difference with 3 GB vs. 2 GB of memory?\nThoughts? Answers?\n\nA: You're not the first person to wonder about this. Yes, matched pairs are good for speed. More RAM is also good for speed. In my experience, and in what I've read, the speed boost from more RAM more than offset the penalty for mismatched pairs.\n", "Q: How often does iCloud sync bookmarks, between iPhone 4 and iPad 2 I've just updated an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2 to iOS 5, and turned on iCloud, with syncing of Bookmarks enabled on both.

I am rather new to Mac, but I am trying to get familiar with Terminal and I want to change its theme. I am a bit confused on how to go about installing Solarized themes I am seeing so much of around the net. I am able to get the theme installed for vim, but I want it for just my general terminal usage.\nI see some suggesting to install SIMBL but then I read if you have Lion, SIMBL is not needed with the color support that it has.\nAnd then I've seen a suggestion to just \"double click\" to install, I am not entirely sure what is meant to be double clicked, the Solarized Dark ansi.terminal file?\nMy concern is running something that I am not sure what it is going to do. So anyone who could shed some light on this process, that would be extremely helpful!\n\nA: Double-Clicking a .terminal file will not \"run\" anything, it will just install the configuration in Terminal. At the end you will get to the same result by double-clicking and by importing the settings from Terminal directly.\n\nA: Using the 'save link as' option on the Github site for these themes didn't work, as noted in another answer. I dug in and noticed that the XML file formats were different when comparing the export of built-in themes and the ones I was trying to import.\nWhen I did the Download .zip (the link is on the RHS of the main github window) and expanded the .zip file, it resulted in getting Solarized Dark.terminal and Solarized Light.terminal files which were import-able.\n\nA: Just open up terminal, go to the preferences and select the theme (the .terminal file)\n\n", "Q: How do I get Siri to make an event on a Gmail or Exchange calendar?

I tried asking in Apple Support Communities but didn't get a helpful response.\n\nA: This Apple Support Document explains the Settings ▸ Location Services ▸ System Services screen.\nThe items on the list are all system services that could make use of your iPhone or iPod's  location information. While the page above does not explicitly explain each setting, Traffic uses your location to get data about whether nearby roads are congested or not  and uses your anonymized information to help update this database; Setting Time Zone uses your location to automatically select what time zone your phone should be set for; Location-based iAds uses your location to serve relevant advertisements; Diagnostics and Usage is rather unexplained, Compass Calibration uses your location to calibrate which direction your iPhone thinks it is facing, and Cell Network Search uses your location information (anonymously) to help build a crowd-sourced database of the location of cell phone towers.\n\nA: I conclude that there is no documentation.\n", "Q: Making fonts larger in apps under Lion While there is no system-wide way to make all fonts larger under Lion without leaving native resolution, many individual programs do have a way to make text and various elements larger on the screen.

It's faster than my old one and holds all my songs, but I thought it would have a camera. I don't know much about the Apple Store (I don't go there often), but I thought that after a new model comes out, they stop selling the old one. This one was bought in summer of 2011, so I was under the impression that it would be a 4th generation with a camera and all. Am I not accessing the camera? Is it there, but I can't see it? Is there an app I need to buy to use it?\n\nA: Apple sells refurbished models of many of their products, including the iPod Touch. So it's quite possible that you have a previous model (also known as the 3rd generation iPod touch). \nTo tell, if your iPod Touch looks like this: \n\nyou have the 3rd generation (without the camera).\nIf it looks like this: \n\nyou have the 4th generation model, with the camera.\nIf it doesn't look like either of these, you have an even earlier model, but that is unlikely as Apple rarely sells models two generations old. You can see the full range, and get more help on determining the model from this website. Identifying iPod Models\n\nA: If it has a camera, there should be a Camera app already installed which you should be able to find on one of your screens. \nIf you can’t find the camera app in spotlight or in the App Store to reinstall it, and you’re sure you physically have a camera, restore the device in iTunes to wipe and reload all the software before you seek hardware service. \n", "Q: How do I restore my iPhone from an iCloud backup? I just installed iOS 5 on my iPhone 4 several days ago, and I backed it up to iCloud. After performing a sync with my PC, it deleted a bunch of apps. I'd like to restore these from the iCloud backup.\nI tried searching Apple's site and Google to see how to restore from a backup, but all the examples are for newly activated phones, not existing phones. I couldn't find any options relevant to this in the settings app.\nI tried pressing \"Restore\" in iTunes, which deleted all the data on the iPhone. When it started up again, it took me through some basic configuration steps, but none of the steps asked me if I want to restore the phone from an iCloud backup. The only thing close to this was when it asked me if I want to backup to iCloud or my PC. I chose iCloud.\nHow can I force my iPhone to download all the data that was backed up to iCloud?\nUpdate: according to iCloud: Backup and restore overview, it says that I need to go through the setup assistant and choose to restore from iCloud. The problem is that the setup it took me through was the standard iOS 5 setup which just asks you to enable/disable services such as location and iCloud backup. It doesn't seem to be the same setup assistant that appears on brand new phones. So the question is how to force the setup assistant to show on a non-new phone.\n\nA: When you restored your phone, did you do the configuration steps in iTunes or on the iPhone itself? Try restoring again, and follow the steps on the iPhone, not in iTunes. I've seen some reports claiming that iCloud restores can only be started from the device itself.\n\nA: To see the setup assistant in a non-new phone, yo need to reset \"all settings and data\" from the iPhone, not from iTunes. \n\nA: I just wrote instructions on how to do this. Hopefully it helps...\n", "Q: If I upgrade to iOS 5, can I restore a 4.2 backup? I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.2 backed up to one of my PCs which I no longer use. If I upgrade to iOS 5, will I lose the opportunity to restore from one of these old backups? Would I be able to restore the phone to the old operating system and then restore from an old backup?\n\nA: No, you will not lose the ability to restore from backup. It's the same situation if you were upgrading to a brand new phone - it is quite possible to restore a iPhone 3G (running iOS 4) to an iPhone 4S. The operating system on the iOS 5 phone would remain iOS 5, but the data would be properly pulled from the backup.\nSomeone may want to clarify this, but I believe iPhone backups are almost solely your own user data, and very few system files, as system files or OS updates can simply be re-downloaded.\n\nA: \nIf I upgrade to iOS 5, will I lose the opportunity to restore from one\n  of these old backups?\n\nNo. You can restore your settings, data, photos, videos, apps, and anything else iTunes has backed up from iOS 4 right over to the new iOS 5. Backups are compatible with future versions of iOS. You could likely restore an iOS 3 backup to a device running iOS 5. The only complication you would run across would be the apps and whether they retained support for your current iOS. Most developers periodically drop support for older devices as time goes on. For example, most new games in the App Store very rarely support the iPhone 3G or older iPod Touches. Moreover, they have also begun dropping support for older iOS versions, such as v3.0. If this conflict every surfaced, iTunes would simply not migrate over any apps that did not support your device (of course still moving over the rest of your data).\n\nWould I be able to restore the phone to the old operating system and\n  then restore from an old backup?\n\nYes, and no. Let me explain the \"yes.\" Apple digitally signs every release of iOS. This signature is verified by Apple prior to its installation. This is often referred to as a \"signing window.\" During this window, any firmware can be installed on your phone, provided it has a valid signature and is being permitted by Apple (passes verification). Apple has historically left the window open for about a week and only for the previous version of iOS (e.g., if iOS 5.1 was released tomorrow, the window would cover iOS 5, if iOS 5.2 was released after that, the window would cover 5.1, and so on). More specifically, now that Apple has released iOS 5.0, iOS 4.3.5 (the previous version of iOS) is likely still being accepted, but that window is fast closing (and could likely have already been closed). Additionally, the rollback only applies to the direct previous build (in this case only iOS 4.3.5 and not 4.3.3 or 4.2.1), but it is time sensitive (iOS ups the ante by introducing tighter measures that may prevent the use of SHSH blobs, effectively sealing a downgrade to Apple's small window, but that's another topic altogether).\nIf you decide the day of release that the new firmware isn't for you, an immediate downgrade is 100% possible. As the days pass by, that number drops dramatically. If you miss that window, you will be unable to install the previous release without SHSH blobs, and software designed to jailbreak devices, which can allow a downgrade indefinitely. It's of note that SHSH blobs must be taken from a device running that particular build. You cannot extract SHSH blobs for iOS 4.3.3 from iOS 4.3.5.\nSo it's a mixed bag. Yes you can downgrade, but you must act fast. After that, it is a resounding \"no.\" Unless of course you have met the requirements (SHSH blobs, etc.). However, as I said, iOS ups the stakes by seeking to block (or rather change the behaviour of) SHSH blobs, effectively limiting a downgrade to Apple's window.\nThis of course omits discussion of the baseband (the component that handles cellular data) which is another factor to consider should you requiring unlocking the handset to handle multiple carriers, however, this falls slightly outside the scope of your question, and for your intents and purposes, something you needn't worry about.\n", "Q: Anyone gotten 10.7.2 to bind properly to Active Directory in a multi-domain environment? I work for an international non-profit that has Active Directory with multiple domains. (A bunch of them.) We can't get Lion (10.7.2) to bind to it properly. Has anyone been successful in getting AD to work in Lion 10.7.2? We have a bunch of new Macs and can't get them on the network. We'll be testing AdmitMac this week, but would rather not pay more than $100 a machine to get them hooked up.\n\nA: MacWindows has a lot of good feedback about this issue.  In my own testing I've found that 10.7.3 has certainly improved network logins on AD2003-bound Macs, though its still not as reliable (or fast) as I'd like.\nAs always, contact your SE and leave feedback about your issues.\n", "Q: How can I select all in a Google doc with an iPad?

Who knows what the future may bring...\n\nFor historical purposes, here is how this worked on 5.0:\nApple apparently has silently added URL shortcuts for these sort of quick functions to iOS 5.0. Jeff Broderick (blog at http://brdrck.me/ ) has assembled a nice dashboard of these shortcuts with gorgeous icons to save the web clips to the home screen of your iOS device.\nSimply browse your iOS device to http://brdrck.me/settings/ and pick from the many web clips that he has assembled. These are basically the same as taking a web site in the iPhone configuration utility and adding it to your home screen with a nice icon.\nThis could be something that was meant for testing or will get pulled according to some rumors about the latest 5.1 beta - but there's no way to know what will happen other than waiting until official documentation comes out or this change gets pulled / disabled.\n\nA: I was able to create a webclip that takes me directly to the Call Forwarding toggle screen, something that no one else apparently has done before, which is baffling to me. Anyway, it works great, but I would love to be able to make it toggle the setting on or off. If that's not possible then I could make two that have a static setting of on and off. Anyone know how to do this?\nThe url for the webclip is: prefs:root=Phone&path=CallForwarding\nI created a config profile in iPhoneConfigurationUtility, emailed it to myself, clicked and installed it, and it worked! Simple things like this make me happy.\n\nA: Unfortunately not because there is no public API making these settings available to developers.\n\nA: Found one at least - search for \"Dimmer,\" gives you brightness. You can set it that each launch toggles between two manual presets. Would be great if it self-quit, but it's better than nothing.\nWould be even better if there were equivalent apps for bluetooth, wifi, airplane mode, ringer volume...\n", "Q: Confused by Siri's answer I asked: \"Should I wear a jacket today\"\nIt replied: \"Sorry Nathan, I can't look for places in France\"\nWhat does that mean?

I'm going on a long backpacking trip and going to leave my Macbook at home unused. How should I store its battery to maximize the battery life?\n\nA: Battery technology used by Apple is no different than other laptops.

Here are their pages on memory - it looks like 16 GB (2 x 8GB modules) will be your max RAM.\nSimilarly, here's info on hard-drive upgrades. It looks like 1TB is going to be your maximum, though as far as I know that's merely a limitation to what sizes are available in the 2.5-inch form factor that the MacBook Pro (and almost every other laptop in existence) uses. If and when larger 2.5-inch drives are released, an MBP should be able to use one.\n", "Q: See date/time of most recent WLAN sync in iTunes When syncing via WLAN, the most recent sync date/time is displayed on the iOS device but not on iTunes (where only the time of the last backup is shown which seems to be the time of the most recent cable-based sync).

I'd like to sync my contacts from the Mac addressbook to an Android phone, but I'd rather not use Google (or any cloud) where I have no control over my data.\nSo far I found SyncMate and Missing Sync. Both cost $40 and promise to do sync more data that I will ever get on my Android phone.\nSyncMate offers a free edition that can sync the contacts to the phone, but it's slow (more than 3 minutes to sync 250 contacts), has no progress bar and won't update the contacts on the Mac if I added a number on the phone (and I have set the sync to bidirectional!).\nThe Missing Sync doesn't seem to offer a free or trial edition, so can't tell how well it works.\nHas anybody compared contact syncing with these two products? And are there other options?\n\nA: I finally found a solution that I'm happy with:\n\n\n*\n\n*On my NAS appliance, I installed OwnCloud, which supports contact synchronisation with the CardDAV protocol. OS X support CardDAV out of the box.\n\n*On the Android device I installed CardDAV-Sync and Contact Editor Pro (see the OwnCloud doc). Both together cost about $5, but there are free versions that also work well with fewer features. Still much less than $40 for Missinc Sync or SyncMate.\nThus I get the advantages of a cloud solution (immediate updates, two-way sync) and get to keep my contacts private. \n\nA: What about importing your contacts from the Mac as a vcard file on your phone? I do not have an Android handset myself, but it seems like there exists such import/export functionality.\n\nA: there is an great little app SmoothSync for Cloud Contacts\nhas worked really well for me :)\n", "Q: Migrating to iCloud when I sync with an Exchange account in Outlook What happens to Microsoft Exchange accounts accessed in Outlook on a Windows machine when one migrates to iCloud?

It's annoying when using full screen drawing apps for example.\n\nA: I think you might be talking about the Notification Center. Does it look like the pictures in this iOS: Understanding Notifications page?\nIf so, go to Settings -> Notifications -> Calendar, and turn off 'Notification Centre'.\n", "Q: Transporting from home to work (~10 min by car), should I just make my MacBook Pro sleep, or shut it completely down first? I just got a new MacBook Pro, and is looking at how the power modes work, and according to this article: About Energy Saver sleep and idle modes in Mac OS X, making it sleep by closing the lid (say) will put it into a low-power mode.\nHowever, the article also says that it uses power to keep RAM contents. What I'm wondering is if the sleep mode is just a mode meant for \"sleep on my desk\", or meant for transport.\nSo, tomorrow I will bring my computer to work, by car, I have a computer bag I'll use so it'll be protected, but I'm worried that if I just put it to sleep, it'll get hotter than just regular off, and I know that you're not supposed to stash a running computer into a confined space, like a computer bag, because the heat might induce wear'n'tear problems on various parts.\nSo, should I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just make it sleep by closing the lid?\n\n*or, should I turn it completely off before transport?\n\n\nAlso, if option 1 is OK for a 5-10 minute ride, but not OK for, say, a train-ride to our offices in the capital (2-3 hours by bus and train), I would like to know that as well.\nI've had a Windows machine for quite some time and I always put the unit into hibernation before transporting it, in order to make it go completely off, but also start somewhat faster than a complete reboot. Is sleep similar to hibernation, or is there some other mode like hibernation I should use?\n\nA: It's perfectly OK to transport it while it's sleeping - I do this all the time.\nThe disk is stopped and the only power draw is what is required to keep the memory contents (and the fading in/out of the power light).  Any heat it generates during sleep is pretty much undetectable (in human terms).  As long as nothing is connected to it, it shouldn't wake up in the bag.\n\nA: I almost never shut down my Macbooks, either MBP or MBA. I not only transport them to work while asleep, I travel by car, motorcycle, and air with them sleeping. I motorcycle camp and my MBA rides under the seat, sleeping, so I can access the net quickly when I arrive at the campground. (Campfires are better with a movie from Amazon on Demand--LOL) I only fully shut them down when an update requires it. Otherwise, I shut the lid, wait a few seconds for RAM to store to memory \"just in case,\" and go. I've never had one get even warmish, let alone hot, and it's never resulted in damage to the Macbooks. This is one of the best features of OSX, and I take full advantage of it.\n", "Q: Error when restoring a iOS 4.3.5 backup onto a iOS 5 device I have tried several times with several backups, but i keep getting the message that the backup is corrupted or not compatible.\n\nA: After the restore fails, take a look at the phone and see if your data is installed.\nRestoring data after every major iOS update has failed on me, but after I put the apps back on, all my data is there.  Pick a few apps that you know contain data (Contacts, games, documents, Notes, login details) and see if your data has at least been restored.\nIt takes some time to put the apps and usic back on, but major iOS updates only happen once every couple of years.\n", "Q: WiFi sync with computer connected by cable to the WiFi router? My computer does not have a WiFi card, so I connect it via LAN cable to my router. My iPhone is connected to the WiFi signal of that router. Is there some kind of magic that will enable me to use WiFi sync with my computer?\n\nA: No, if they are both on the same network, there is nothing special you need to do.\n\nA: First off it's not a stupid question and secondly it's not on the same network. Your PC is on the LAN, that is one network and you iPhone using wifi is a different netowrk. The iPhone sends a Bootp broadcast on udp port 67. This broadcast will not be seen on the second network (LAN). I searched high and low to find out how to get this to work and there is no solution anywhere. So I decided to figure it out myself.  The broadcast will not go across 2 networks normally. Fortunately I have a firewall that allows bridging. It also allows me to keep policy based functions between the 2 networks. The bridging allows the broadcast. After the broadcast it does a multicast on udp port 5353. Then the sync works.\nTo get this working on your firewall/router look for bridging for that make and model. In some cases there may not be any security between the networks once you do this. This is only a problem if someone hacks into your wifi.\n", "Q: Upgraded to Lion with an application in Snow Leopard called LaunchPad Recently I upgraded my laptop from Snow Leopard to Lion.  However in Snow Leopard, I fooled around with the system a bit and \"named\" an app called LaunchPad.app(It's actually called quickpick)  Now in Lion, it retained the old app and didn't change it to the actual LaunchPad.  When I try to delete the LaunchPad app now, it says the it is necessary for the system and I can't delete it.  What should I do now?  Thanks everyone.\n\nA: Create a Time Machine backup of your current system, reinstall Lion, restore everything but applications from backup, then restore the other applications manually from Time Machine.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, and have good current backups, you could launch Terminal and enter the following exactly as shown:\nsudo rm -rf /Applications/LaunchPad.app\n\nEnter your password and the application should be removed.\nNow you shouldn't have LaunchPad.app anymore. You could try to get LaunchPad from a friend, by installing a 10.7.2 combo updater, or by reinstalling Lion.\n", "Q: Can I show a 24-Hour clock on my Mac's Lock Screen? I just got a MacBook Pro, and different from my iMac is that I'll be using the lock-screen much more on this one.\nI noticed that in the upper right corner of the lock screen, the time is shown, but it is in 12-hour mode with AM/PM indicators.\nI guess this is some remnant of the machine having been configured to use english language as the main language (I'm a developer, I don't want to have to fight with badly worded Norwegian translations of error messages on google).\nI have configured my main user to have normal Norwegian formats for everything, but I guess that on the lock (and possibly on the logon screen as well?) screen, there is some kind of global system-wide configuration in use.\nSo, can I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure the lock screen (or the system wide configuration) to use 24-hour clock?\n\n*Remove the clock altogether?\n\n\nA: Since at the login window (and the lock screen) your user is not logged in, you´ll have to edit the global preferences: \nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences AppleLocale en_GB\n\nand:\nsudo defaults write /var/root/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences AppleLocale en_GB\n\nand then do a reboot. This fixed it for me (and I hope, Apple fixes that sooner or later). :-)\n", "Q: How do I unhide purchases from the App Store? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs possible modify the App Store purchased listing (delete or hide some/unhide other hidden apps)? \n\nI hid an app listed in my purchased list by accident, how would I go about getting in back?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to your account in iTunes on your computer by selecting your Apple ID on the top right in the iTunes Store.\n\n*Select view hidden purchases.\n\n*Find the app and unhide.\n\n\n\n", "Q: What is SafariDAVClient doing hogging up memory? I felt that my computer was slow today so I checked Activity Monitor. What I found was a process called SafariDAVClient hogging up 3.32GB of memory.\nI am not even running Safari. Has anyone seen this problem? I've recently updated to 10.7.2 and my first suspicion is iCloud syncing. If anyone else is having the same problem, we should probably file a bug to Apple.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem after updating to 10.7.2. SafariDAVClient also caused CPU-spikes all the time.\nDisabling Bookmark Sync in the iCloud preferences, coupled with a reboot \"solved\" it.\nIt wouldn't hurt if you would file a bugreport with Apple as well. My ID is rdar://10280447, it's still open.\n\nA: I also get this problem from behind an NTLM authenticated proxy at work.\nIf I switch to a network without the NTLM proxy the process quits and I'm back to normal.\nI also had this problem with other processes like syncdefaultsd when behind the proxy.\nWhile I'm going through the proxy I turn off iCloud.\nLots of things don't work behind the proxy, like AppStore.\nI'm looking at using cntlm or ntlmaps (local proxy relay), and then using the Network settings in System Preferences to point to the local proxy, to see if that may solve it. Although our firewall blocks almost anything but port 80 and 443, so that could be an added problem.\nI've used cntlm on Windows before and it is good, but I'll need to compile it for OS X, but not yet, not yet (later).\n\nA: I had to throw the folder SafariDAVclient in the trash. I tried to take Safari off the icloud and stop the bookmark sync, but that did not help. Everything is fine now. \n", "Q: Getting an unlocked iPhone 4/4S to work on T-Mobile There are several aspects I'm not clear on, and I'm wondering if what I want is even possible.\n1) I want an unlocked (officially; no jail-breaking) iPhone 4/iPhone 4S. The iPhone 4 unlocked is currently $550 for 8GB at Apple. I think they'll be announcing the pricing for the iPhone 4S unlocked sometime in November.\n2) I'm only interested in a month-to-month plan from T-Mobile. I see some listed here: T-Mobile Plans The one that looks best to me is the new $30 \"Unlimited Web and Text with 100 Minutes Talk\". I've noted that only the first 5gb of data are at up to 4G speeds, I guess the rest go back down to 2G. This will be more than enough for me.\nIs this possible? Will the iPhone 4 get 4G speeds even though it is not \"supposed\" to be on the T-Mobile network? If this is possible, how do I go about doing it? It looks like I need a \"micro-SIM\"? I'm fine with giving up my old cell phone number. Are there any potential issues with trying to get this (i.e. Does t-mobile only give me a micro-SIM with a \"qualifying\" phone purchase or something? Or do they have to activate the phone \"in-store\" or something?)\nAny potential issues you guys notice?\n\nA: \nWill the iphone get 4g speeds\n\nNo it won't. iPhones, even 4 and 4S, are not 4G devices. The 4 is for the iPhone fourth generation, but they are in reality 3G devices. So you won't get better speed than 3G (for sure).\nI'm not sure for the network itself since I'm in Canada and I don't look at US providers very often. From memory T-Mobile has a different (AWS) network than AT&T so that could also affect your connectivity and speed. You better check the phone versus provider specifications (or someone else doing the same as you).\n\nA: Regarding \"Micro-SIM\": There's no need to buy a seperate \"micro-sim\". You can modify your existing SIM card using \"micro sim cutters\" available. Check this for instance \n\nA: A lot of time has passed since this question was asked but thought I would give a specific from experience answer.\n1) I purchased an officially unlocked (not jail broken) iPhone 4S from Apple in December 2011 to use with my tmobile plan in the US.\n2) I got a micro sim from T-mobile (for free, just have to talk with them and work them down). In general I can only get 2G speeds (edge, letter E shows for data connection) but I noticed in mid 2012 that I could get a 3G connection and the respective data speed near my house in the burbs but not in the large city nearby.\nA couple other notes on iPhone features with tmobile. Visual voicemail does not work. Instead your voicemail is dialed when you touch voicemail in the phone app. Also, MMS is not really reliable and you must be sure to get the proper settings done. Here's a link that tells how to set the settings for the cellular and MMS. https://t-mobile.jive-mobile.com/#jive-document?content=%2Fapi%2Fcore%2Fv1%2Fdocuments%2F2383\nI hope this answer helps somebody out there even though the iPhone 5 is out now so people are more concerned with its compatibility probably.\n(Typed on iPhone. Please excuse grammar or weird auto correction results.)\nUpdate\nThe link I included in my answer has been updated since I last looked at it months ago. It links to another T-Mobile article that talks about \"speed sightings\" that can be found in several cities across the US. I did a little more googling and found that the iPhone 4S is 4G compatible in about 13-15 cities where T-Mobile has refarmed their towers/spectrum to provide 4G (the slower than LTE version) in the iPhone compatible 1900MHz band.\nUpdate\nReceived another update to the cellular data network settings around 4/8/2013 that enables 4G and it at least works in the Austin, TX area. Unfortunately this removed the Personal Hotspot options for me since my current data plan is not really allowed to use that feature.\n", "Q: iCloud share group of calendars? I've been using icalx.com to sync all my many calendars as a single group. When I turned on iCloud, all my calendar group structure completely disappeared and I see no way to re-add it. Is there any way (including workarounds using icalx or Google Calendar as an intermediary) to continue sharing all my calendars as a single group? It's a huge pain for people to set up 10+ subscriptions just to see my events, not to mention having to check and uncheck all 10 each time they want to see what I'm doing.\n\nA: When MobileMe upgraded calendars - it removed the group option. iCloud does not have a folder/group data structure.\nBusyCal does let you create groups to manage your local view of iCloud (and other) calendars, but doesn't change iCloud's limitation to not have those groups appear on the server end of things.\nTheir blog is an excellent source to get clear and well prepared discussion on the changes MobileMe has made as well as how iCloud is different.\n", "Q: On Snow Leopard, the default unzip tool won't ask for password but just report it can't unzip? Yesterday, I zipped up something using 7-zip on the PC, using a password for the zip file.  So if I copy the file to another PC and unzip, it asks for the password and restore the file.  However, if I copy the file to a Mac with Snow Leopard and double click on that file, it will simply say, can't unzip the file.  (Archive Utility was the app).\nFor me, since I know UNIX, I tried to open up Terminal and typed in\nunzip foo.zip\n\nand it actually asked for the password and unzipped for me, but I just wonder, what about if I don't use Terminal, or for people who are not familiar with the command line, how can it be done?\n\nA: I don't think the built-in decompression utility can unzip password protected files.  However, The Unarchiver is the way to go for all things compression related on OS X anyway.\n", "Q: Apple's AirPort App Apple just released an app that helps you configure your apple router. I downloaded it to try it out and when I opened my iPad's Apps tab in iTunes I noticed you can transfer documents to this app. I would like to know what kind of documents can you transfer and for what purpose?\n\nA: Backups of your current setup and config, and restores of same.\n", "Q: Will iCloud backups of iOS devices restore the iOS Keychain? Prior to iCloud, it was necessary to explicitly encrypt iOS device backups in order to include passwords stored in the iOS Keychain. Indeed, this was an important and recommended use of encryption, which allowed easy migration from device to device without having to reenter passwords, but it us unclear whether iCloud backups behave the same way. In fact, it's difficult to tell from the layout the settings UI in iTunes whether encryption applies only to local backups, or to those iCloud backups as well (though the former seems to be the case):\n\nAre iCloud backups of iOS devices encrypted by default? Do they store iOS Keychains, so that after a restore of an iOS device from an iCloud backup, all saved passwords are available there? \n\nA: I do not believe the keychain is included under the iCloud umbrella. It covers: apps, mail, contacts, photos, calendar, and reminders. Additionally, application data is backed up for supported apps (currently not many)\nMy guess is that the password will need to be provided when restoring an iPad iCloud backup. \n\nA: There is now a workaround of this in that iOS 7 has now provided keychain syncing from iOS to OS X. You should be able to inspect the contents of the iCloud keychain as well as back it up / restore it to another device by backing up your Mac or just enabling keychain sync on your new (erased) device once restoring the normal backup.\n\nA: No. Apple says:\n\niCloud Keychain items are not part of iCloud Backup. \n\n", "Q: If I buy a Mac that comes with Lion, can I install it on my old Macs too? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDoes buying a new mac also get you Lion on your Apple ID? \n\nIf I buy a new Mac with OS X Lion, will I then be able to update my old computers to Lion via the Mac App Store without charge?\n\nA: No - macs ship with one license to Lion - for that mac.\nIf you buy an upgrade outright, that applies to all your macs.\n", "Q: How do I remove the sync status icon from the menu bar after migrating to iCloud? How do I remove the sync status icon from the menu bar after migrating to iCloud?\n\nPrior to iCloud the Sync pane of MobileMe preferences had a simple setting for this, but after migration it is gone.\n\nA: Hold the Command key while dragging the icon out of the menu bar.\nAlso you could delete ~/Library/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist and log out and then back in again. Killing SystemUIServer might also work to repaint the menu bar, but I prefer to log out when changing a plist that also has an associated lockfile.\n", "Q: Carbon Copy Cloner and FileVault Volumes I am about to get my SSD back from an RMA process.\nI currently have my backup HDD and I'm considering utilizing FileVault's full disk encryption. I'd like to minimize the number of writes before I get the SSD back in my machine.\nCan I enable FileVault on both drives, then Carbon Copy Clone the HDD -> SSD?\n\nA: I replied earlier with an answer without noticing you had tagged it as Lion related; take a look at this document, it should answer most of your questions.\nFrom the Developer of CCC:\n↘ link\n\nIs there any possibility to have the backup on my other second drive be encrypted?\nYes, you can enable encryption on your backup volume, or reformat it\n  as encrypted using Disk Utility:\nFull Disk Encryption (Lion only)\nCCC fully supports Lion's Full Disk Encryption.\n\n", "Q: Need help creating reminders on iOS 5 After upgrading form iOS 5 beta to the final release, I cannot create any new reminders.\nThe issue seems to be caused by the fact that there is no reminder lists to which to add a new reminder, but I can't find any way to add a new list to the app.\nIn the screenshot, you can see I have the \"Completed\" list of tasks, that I made with one of the earlier betas of iOS 5, but there are no other lists.  \n\nThe system's language is set to Italian, I hope that the screenshot is clear enough to show the situation.\n\nA: On the iPad Reminders app, there is no + button when viewing Completed tasks.\nWhat happens when you click on Data? Can you then add items?\nEdit\nIt looks like others are having the same problem. Does this reply work for you:\n\nhere's the solution that seems to work... have tried it, reversed it, and retried and it worked twice.  Turn on reminders in icloud.  go to reminder app.... + should now be there.  i then turned off reminders becasue it seems to just drain the battery... but select option to keep remdiners on the iphone when it prompts you.\n\n\nA: On the screen you are showing in the screenshot, click on the button with three lines. On the screen that lists the lists, click on the \"Edit\" button and you'll see a text entry at the bottom of the list of lists that says \"Create New List...\" Click it and you'll have a new list.\n", "Q: Why do carriers sell the iPhone for so much cheaper than Apple? I've been looking at iPhone 4S prices. I'm not an US citizen but I've been wondering why does it cost only $199 with a Sprint/Verizon/AT&T contract and why does it cost $649 without those contracts?\nWhat are the limitations if I was a US citizen and I was going to use one of those service providers?\n\nA: In the US, carriers offer phones if you sign up for a 2-year contract at a heavily subsidized price.  The $649 is the price of the phone without that subsidy (retail price).  The subsidy also means these phones are carrier-locked, or bound to one carrier.  You can sometimes get the carrier to unlock these or hack it, but don't count on this.\nCitizenship isn't so much a qualifier as having a US credit history and billing address. Presumably the carrier is on the hook to subsidize your hardware so they try hard to ensure you will honor your contract to maintain a stream of payments to them (or they can be fairly certain to collect the early termination fee). Having a US credit card (or cash) as well as having a Social Security or equivalent tracking number so the carriers can run a credit check against their US database of buyers increases your likelihood for being approved for a subsidized phone. If the carriers can't get a good credit check, you may be forced to pay the unlocked prices or buy on the grey market or a used handset.\n", "Q: What's a good Font Manager for OS X? I am searching for a good font manager for Lion. It should work especially with google web fonts. \nI need a good overview of non-alphabetic unicode characters. And activating/deactivating would be great i.e. to check, if web pages I work on work well with fonts being installed or not.\nSo basically I need a font manager, that supports me for developing websites.\n\nA: Font Case is the app you are looking for. It has activation/deactivation, web preview mode, glyph overviews, collections etc.\n", "Q: Can you pull up the context menu in a Stack (e.g., Downloads)? My Downloads folder is on my Dock, and sometimes when I want to open a file, I don't want to open it in the default app. For example, I want to open a jpg in Pixelmator instead of Preview.\nAnyway I can do that from the Dock and not have to open the folder, find the file, and then open it?\nI thought that you might be able to right click on the icon as you would in windows, but it doesn't work?\n\nA: If the application you want to open the program in is in your Dock, you can drag the file icon from the Stack and drop it on the application icon.\nAlternately, command clicking on the file in the Stack will open a Finder window with that file already selected. You would still need to control-click it and open it, but it cuts out a few steps.\nSadly, there does not appear to be a way to make the context menu appear in a Stack.\n", "Q: What do I need to connect MacBook 13\" mid-2010 to HDMI TV? From what I understand, the mid-2010 MB (MacBook7,1), unlike its predecessors, is able to send audio and video from its Mini-DisplayPort to an HDMI port with a simple Mini-DP-to-HDMI adapter, and does not require extra hardware to convey the audio signal.\nIs this in fact true?  Are there any other dependencies, such as the make/model of the HDTV?  And are there 3rd-party, off-the-shelf adapters (from, say, Staples or Radio Shack) that will fill the bill?\nOne of our local authorized Apple dealers told us we'd need a separate audio cable!\n\nA: Yes, it is true. \nMacBook (Mid 2010), MacBook Air (Late 2010), MacBook Pro (Mid 2010), Mac mini (Mid 2010), iMac (Late 2009), Mac Pro (Mid 2010) and later models supply multichannel audio (up to 8 channels) and video signals over Mini DisplayPort.\nThere shouldn't be any dependencies for it to work other than an HDMI cable to use from your HDTV to your adapter.

Is the only thing I can do to contact Apple iTunes Store Customer Service to resolve this?\n\nA: ok, the best way I found, is to use the Express Lane.  Just google for: Apple Express Lane and you will find it.\n\nA: As far as I know - movies are not yet available via the iTunes \"Purchased\" tab for re-download.  Only TV series are so far.  I think Apple is still negotiating the rights to allow movie downloads multiple times after purchase.\n", "Q: Is there a tabbed PDF reader for Mac OS X? I am looking for a tabbed PDF reader, preferably with annotation support (highlighting mostly) for Mac OS X. I looked at the Skim FAQ which said that tabs would never come to Skim.\nI am currently writing where I need to have multiple PDFs open for reference (at the moment 17). This is a lot of windows which clutters upp my Exposé.\nDoes anybody know if such a PDF reader exists for Mac OS X?\nI have had a look at Adobe Acrobat Reader, Skim, Preview.app, PDF Pen.\nI found Dioretsa which has tabs, but no sadly no annotation.\nUpdate 2015-11-20: Funny how history repeats itself. PDF Expert recently released a Mac version (Readdle's PDF Expert for iOS has been around for some time). The pase years I have been using Preview, but PDF Expert is now my goto PDF reader with tabs and annotation. It's fast as well (which cannot be said about Adobe's PDF products).\nUpdate 2012-05-16: Saving annotations in the PDF itself is also a must. E.g. Skim and Mendeley do not do this. Otherwise, Mendeley would have been a good choice.\n\nA: Two years later, I may have found something. There is now an app on the Mac App Store called PDF Reader X. It's free, has tabs and supports annotation!\n\nA: Clearview Reader from Canoe Software looks really promising. I liked their free app, PDFNut, which also supports tabbed browsing, bookmarks, and annotations. Clearview Reader has more features and for the very reasonable price of $7 I'm more than happy to support the developers.\n\nA: It's certainly not the primary function of the program, but what about Safari? It displays and renders PDFs. It doesn't handle annotations natively, but there are Safari extensions like Coda Notes that add the ability to annotate.\nAlternately, your web browser of choice could be used similarly.\n\nA: Admittedly, this isn't quite ideal, but…\nPreview.app has a kind of tab-like behavior in the sidebar when you open multiple PDFs simultaneously, either by dragging them all to to the icon at once, opening multiple files using shift in the open dialog, or by dragging additional PDFs into the sidebar of an already open document.\nOnce opened this way, you can switch between documents with option-page up/down, which maintains your position in each document.\n\nA: Mac's own Preview actually works really well when working with multiple documents. I would even say that it's better than the tabbed approach (I tried both MightPDF and PDFNut) as I would often work with 15 or so PDFs all opened, resulting in tabs that no longer display any coherent information. The thumbnail on the side approach of Preview allows me to scroll through and easily locate the document I want. \nAlso, any annotations made will stick if you go to the print menu then on the bottom left corner, change to \"Save as PDF…\"\n\nA: You should look at 'Mendeley' which is primarily a Dropbox for the scientific Community. The Mendeley Desktop Application has an integrated PDF-Viewer which supports  PDF-Display in Tabs, Text-Highlites and Notes. In the Screenshot you see two PDF's open in the Tabs and i have highlighted some Text at random. \nThe Desktop Software is free and you get 500 MB Space for sharing, like Dropbox you can  expand that space with a premium (paid) Account.\n \n\nA: You can configure Preview to open all files in the same window. Then you move between them with the keyboard (ALT+UP, ALT+DOWN). If you use the \"content table\" view for the sidebar it's the same as tabs but displayed in a vertical row. \n\nA: Check out Scrivener, the writing program. It doesn't use a \"tab\" metaphor, but it supports PDFs and several other document formats, and is quite good at displaying lots of documents and windows of information simultaneously and enabling you to switch around between them and reorder them while you are writing. It uses its own metaphors for organizing documents, patterned after flash cards and cork boards. You should try it out.\n\nA: They support tabs now (2017):\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Acrobat Reader DC \n\n*PDF Pen\n\n\nA: As of MacOS High Sierra (10.13), Preview can display different PDF documents (and other image file types) as Tabs.\n", "Q: iOS 5 change AppStore language After upgrading to iOS 5 my AppStore language changed to German. Referring to that quesiton it is possible to change the language by selecting the country in iTunes like it is described in this apple KB.\nMy problem is the following : I have a Swiss AppStore account, as you may know Switzerland has many official languages (German, French, Italian, ...) that why a Swiss AppStore account could be in German, French or English as default language.\nBefore upgrading to iOS 5, the AppStore language was in English as I want it.\nI've tried the solution given by the Apple KB. But even doing so, you can only select the country but not the language (German is the first language in Switzerland, that's why it falls back to german). By the way, when I go to the iTunes store the language is also German.\nI have tried to set English as default language in the following places :\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS's language in ENG\n\n*iCloud.com account in ENG\n\n*MacOSX Lion's language where I have my iTunes in also ENG\n\n\nWhere can I specify the language so the AppStore & iTunes Store language will be in english ?\n\nA: Settings -> General -> International -> Language -> Make sure it's set to English.\nIf this doesn't work, SYNC to your computer and see if it goes back.\n", "Q: Could aluminium dust inside a Macbook Air create a short circuit? I have a Macbook Air and I'm very happy with it, except for the fact that it made a creaky noise. It turned out the bottom plate wasn't screwed on properly and I had to reseat it (I tried to let a Genius do this, but out of the three Geniuses I visited, no one of them had  the proper screwdriver and wanted to take my Macbook for repair or switch it for a new one, I refused this because I don't want to live for a week or more because of such a stupid problem). \nSo I bought a special pentalobe screwdriver and screwed the bottom plate off. I noticed there was some aluminium dust inside the Macbook Air because the plate has been moving a little and has been scraping onto the body. \nCould this dust create a short circuit theoretically? \nOne little problem is that one screw (of the 10 screws) doesn't tighten anymore, because the bottom plate has been screwed on wrongly in the first place. What kind of glue is the best to use to attach the screw? Of course it must be possible to unscrew it at some point when I want to install a new/bigger SSD.\nThis might sound terrible to the Apple fans who don't want to mess with their machines, but I don't think getting it repaired by a Genius or switching it with a new one solves anything, because this creaking problem is very common and it might start all over again.\n\nA: Loctite make a range of semi-permanent gunks for \"gluing\" screws in place.  A good hardware shop (on-line or in real life) would help.\nThere would have to be a lost of dust for it to be a problem. \n\nA: Aluminum is a conductor, so it is theoretically possible that a trail of aluminum dust could create a short circuit, but I've never encountered any reports of this causing problems in a computer.\n", "Q: Syncing iPhone 3G with iCloud Was wondering whether it's possible to sync non-iOS5 devices (in this case iPhone 3G) with iCloud? In particular I'd be interested in syncing contacts.\nI know syncing iCloud e-mail won't be much of a problem, as it can be configured as a standard IMAP account, but what about the contacts? Does contacts syncing go via some standard protocol that iPhone 3G with appropriate settings could use?\n\nA: Its easy:  \nGo to: setting > Mail, Contacts, Agenda   and \"add a new account\".\nChoose \"other\"\nThen add \"CardDav-accounts\" under \"contacts\" tab \nIn the server field first fill in: contacts.icloud.com\nThen you apple id and password, then add or save account.\nThen the server address will change to something like:  p02-contacts.com\nNext step is to know what unique apple ID you have, you can find it here on your mac:\n~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Sources/<iCloud Account ID>/Configuration.plist.\nNow, go back to the just created account on your iPhone for your contacts and change the server address field. \nContact server: https://p02-contacts.icloud.com:443/<uniqueid>/carddavhome/\nYou have to add everything above, so https://<your correct server>:443/<your uniqueID>/carddavhome/\nBefore you do all this you have of course setup iCloud and make sure that you have address book checked. Also make sure you have deleted your MobileMe account on the iPhone first if you have one. \nIt might take some time but it will work.\n\nA: I got it to work, leaving off the https, and adding /[contact group] after carddavhome.\nDidn't seem to work without the /[contact group]. No idea why.\nStill gave me all contacts, and all groups, but allows me to select the iCloud contact group I wanted (a phone specific group of contacts).\n", "Q: Can the iCloud share app-specific data across devices? Like many people who own both an iPhone and iPad, I like to play games on them -- preferably on the pad when I have it at hand, but on my phone when not.\nOne thing that always irked me was that, for games that run on both, progress on one device wasn't saved or shared to the other.\nIf I configure both devices to use iCloud, will they synch game data? (And if so, can I specify which version of the data takes precedence?)\n\nA: The direct answer to your question is It depends.\nCertain applications like iWork can store data in the cloud which is then synchronized across devices. However there is currently no interface to allow you to choice which document is the primary, as the data is synchronize on a last updated cycle.\nIf the game support using shared document via iCloud, you would be able to synchronize game data, however, by default it will not.\n", "Q: Once backed up iPhone to iCloud, can I delete an app and redownload it with same data? Let's say I'm sick of Angry Birds, I delete it from my phone. I back up my phone daily to iCloud. \nIn a few months when I want to play it again, will all my data be there (or is it different implementation every app)?\nI know there might be two answers since I may either: 1) go to the App store and download it from there, or 2) Sync back the app from iTunes. What would happen in either case?\n\nA: As long as you don't make a single backup of your iOS device after you deleted angry birds, you can restore from a backup and the game should have data of progress you've made till the day of that backup. If you redownload the game, you would not have any app-data, regardless of anything, unless you've jailbroken your device and manually made a backup of the app-data, and reapplied it.\n\nA: In general, iCloud backs up the whole application-folder. That is, all the application data is backed up. However, if an app has been deleted, it is reset - as the deletion could have been due to an issue with the app destroying itself. (e.g. a Facebook bug disables its usage until reinstallation) As you wipe the application from your device (say Angry Birds), iCloud assumes you do not need the application anymore - hence, its data is removed. (+reset, if you intend to install it later on.)\n", "Q: How can I make a playlist from a shuffle sequence? Every once in a while, my iPod does a spectacular job at shuffling the perfect set of songs. Is there any way to save this sequence to a playlist so I can replay it again in the future?\n\nA: From any list of songs in iTunes (like for example, when you're on iTunes DJ) you can select the range of songs by clicking while holding the Shift key. Once all songs are highlighted you can go the File menu and select New Playlist From Selection. A new playlist will be shown at the bottom of the Playlist section containing the exact same song selection and ordering. Hope this helps.\n\nA: No.\nBut there is laborous workaround:\nIf you don't use star rating normaly or using it but never use one star (or two) then go through every song that was playing during shuffle and star them.\nAfter that sync to iTunes, create a Smart Playlist and sort it by the last played column.\nIf you need to sync it back to iPod choose Copy to Play Order. More on this here.\n\nA: You have two options.\n1. On-the-road compatible, but not so user-friendy\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new playlist on the iOS device (iPod Touch is one, of course).\n\n*Then, add the songs one by one from memory.\n\n\nThey will be kept in sort order, and the playlist will be synced to iTunes for future use.\n2. Much easier, but with listening limitations\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync with iTunes.\n\n*Select the Library source on the left panel.\n\n*Sort the tracks by “last played”, by clicking on the title of the “Last played” column. If this column is not visible, right-click on any column's title and check the corresponding item (or hit ⌘J and check it).\n\n*Find the set of songs you liked and select it.\n\n*Create a new playlist from this selection (⌘⇧N).\n\n*Reverse the sort order of the newly created playlist by clicking on the (empty) title of the column that contains the play index (numbers at the extreme left of a song's title).\n\n\nThe only problem with this solution is that if you listen to one of the songs that were in your set, it will have its Last played field updated, and won't be in the proper place… So this solution is usable only if you can sync pretty quickly after listening to the set, or can remember a few songs' positions, or if you avoid listening to them altogether before the next sync.\n", "Q: Why does syncing pictures take so long (even when there are no new pictures) I have about 20GB of photos (from my external hard drive) to sync with my ipod.  The first sync tooks 11 hours to copy everything over.  That makes sense to me as this is actually moving all of this data.\nMy issue is that now when i sync it (no new pictures added or deleted) it sits on this view\n\nfor over 20 minutes (where it say's Step 7 or 8 - Importing Photos).  Why does itunes take so long to sync my photos where there is nothing new to sync?  Shouldn't this just be some sync algorithm to easily see that nothing has changed and just move on?\nAlso, is there anyway to \"debug\" what is taking so long or workaround to try to optimize taking so long?\n\nA: iTunes actually checks every file for change. That's inefficient and takes time - the only way to optimize this way of doing is either not having that amount of pictures (aka reducing the amount of files) - or putting the files into an own directory on the device and viewing them with iFile (applies to jailbroken devices) +(so that iTunes doesn't check them files..)\n", "Q: Reconnecting iPad after iTunes have forgotten it without wiping contents I have several iDevices each used by a different person. I have set up all iDevices to use the same Apple ID for purchasing apps but each iDevice to have a separate Apple ID for iCloud (which is allowed according to Apple)\nHowever I did not know that running this way you have to sync each iDevice to a different iTunes installation (according to this elucidating article on Lifehacker)\nSo, I have one computer (Windows 7 64bit) with iTunes that I previously used to sync both an iPhone 4 and an iPad 1. \n\n\n*\n\n*I first upgraded the iPad 1 to iOS5 and synced it. Worked fine\n(over wifi too) \n\n*I then upgraded the iPhone 4 to iOS5 and synced it.\nWorked fine (over wifi too)\n\n*Then, when I connected the iPad again, iTunes no longer\nrecognized the iPad. I got several errors:\niTunes could not connect     to this iPad because an unknown error occurred (0xE800007F) and \nAn iPad has been detected but it could not be identified properly. Please disconnect and reconnect the iPad, then try again.\n\n*Finally iTunes showed the Set Up Your iPad screen\n\n\nI do not want to Set Up Your iPad since I assume that that would wipe the current configuration of it.\nSince learning that I must sync with a separate iTunes for each iDevice, I have decided that I would like to sync the iPhone 4 with another iTunes.\nHow can I (after moving the iPhone 4) \"reconnect\" the iPad to the same iTunes without wiping its contents?\n(I am also not completely sure on how to \"move\" the iPhone 4, so that it no longer is synced with the iTunes installation that I want the iPad to be connected to).\n\nA: It seems I assumed wrong. Thanks to kenansulayman's answer, I dared to continue after the \"Set Up Your iPad\" screen. When I did, iTunes did not wipe the iPad, it left the old configuration unaltered and started syncing normally.\nAlso, \"moving\" the iPhone was fairly straightforward. I just unchecked the \"Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi\" on the old computer, synced it with the new and checked \"Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi\" there.\n\nA: Assuming you are using the iOS 5, make an iCloud-Backup from your device, then wipe it, finally restore from iCloud and you're good to go.\nThis won't break anything and is pretty much fail-safe. (It worked in beta, too - and saved both my iTouch and iPad from wiping once)\n", "Q: Problem with iMac Apple Remote Recently, my Apple remote has stopped working from a distance of more than one meter. I thought maybe it was the battery, so I bought a new one, but nothing changed.\nI thought I had broken the remote and could not pass a signal at a distance greater than one meter, but I did a test with my friend's Macbook and it works fine from this distance. So, I think that the problem could reside inside my iMac.\nDoes anyone know what's happening?\n\nA: It is hard to say for sure without more information, but my first guess would be interference.\nDo you have another piece of electrical equipment near your iMac that could be impacting the signal? Speakers? A wireless headset? A router?\nIn my new apartment whenever I get a phone call on my 2.4Ghz land-line telephone it drops my WiFi connection on my iMac so interference can definitely cause odd problems!\n", "Q: Can no longer edit my contacts in iOS 5 I just updated to iOS 5 on my iPhone 4, and now I can not edit my contacts. Where \"edit\" use to be is no longer there. If I type a new number on the keypad and hit add to existing contact, I can edit from there, but there is no \"done\" or \"save\". Not sure what to do.\n\nA: This seems to be a bug. I ran into this same problem over the weekend when I was trying to add a new contact I had received over SMS. It seems that depending on how you get to the contact screen, the \"Done\" button may not be there. If you open the Contacts app (instead of getting to your contacts from the Phone app), you should get a contact screen that has the save button. Hope this helps. \n\nA: I had the exact same issue, the edit button mysteriously disappeared!\nI was able to resolve my issue by going into settings -> iCloud and switching Contacts to ON. \n\n", "Q: Cmd-N in Lion Finder shows \"All My Files\" not home? In Lion Cmd-N in Finder opens a new Window with \"All My Files\" showing as the default. Is it possible to set that back to the normal \"home\" directory of my user?\n\nA: You can set the default under Finder -> Preferences.\nLook for New Finder Window Shows\n\n\nA: Step 1: Select Preferences... from the Finder menu (or press ⌘,\nStep 2: At New Finder windows show, select your home directory.\nThere is no step 3.\n\n", "Q: Can you copy location metadata from one photo to another in iPhoto? Some of my imported pictures don't have location data on them because they were created using apps like Diptic.

Let's say I have a few of my favorite artists who I've told my iPhone to sync, even though those songs might not be in any playlist.\nIs there any way, when I open up my iPod (now \"Music\" in iOS 5) to see who those artists are?  Or maybe there are specific albums I've sync'd; is there a way to see those albums listed anywhere?\nIn other words, instead of just my playlists, and all the artists and albums that are on my phone, is it possible to see who the specific artists are that I've checked in the music tab in iTunes when syncing to my iPhone?  Or even the specific albums I've checked?\nEDIT\nHere's the use case, in case that prompts any workarounds.  \nI have my main \"At Work\" playlist, with my thousand or so favorite songs ever.  Every once in a while though I might want a change of pace, and might want to browse through the albums and artists I like enough to sync in toto.  \"Ohh, Robert Cray sounds great right now\".  Currently, my \"Artists\" tab is full of every single artist anywhere in my iPhone, mostly because they have a song or two in the work playlist.  I'd love to get a separate list of the artists and albums whose checkbox I checked in the iTunes Music tab to specifically sync.\n\nA: You could create a smart playlist that excludes files that are already included in another playlist.\nSo, in your case if you generally sync a playlist called \"At Work\" whcih contains what you normally sync, but then also throw a few others into the sync too, you could create a smart playlist that looks for any ticked track that is not already in the \"At Work\" playlist.  Call this \"Adhoc\" or something, and add this to your sync list, and you should have a new playlist that shows anything that wasn;t part of your original sync list.\n", "Q: Help with kernel boot message I recently turned on my iMac (White intel) to find it wouldn't boot.\nRunning the boot in verbose mode I get the following message:\n\nDoes anyone know what this means? Is it a hard disk error?\n\nA: The message is coming from EFI (the firmware boot loader) telling you that the kernel (/mach_kernel) cannot be booted. This message is usually output if the kernel file was not found, or if it prematurely exited and got back to EFI. It could be, for example, because you rm'ed the /mach_kernel file.\nThere actually is a way to fix this without reinstalling the system: If you can boot from a bootable disk with rEFIt and drop into an EFI shell, you might be able to copy over a good kernel (assuming you have one in the disk). Honestly, unless you prepare for these contingencies (i.e. have an alternate EFI boot), you are better off reinstalling/recovering (in Lion).\nAnother idea which springs to mind - if you can attach a hard drive which has OS X on it, press ALT when the system loads (before the nasty message) - this gets you the option to boot from the secondary drive. Then, you can copy over /mach_kernel.\n", "Q: Can't upgrade to 10.7.2 over a previous iCloud beta seed I never got the 10.7.2 update, as you can see here:\n\nBut my system thinks it's running 10.7.2:\n\nRunning Software Update tells me there are no available updates, but 10.7.2 clearly isn't fully installed because I have no iCloud PrefPane:\n\nI've tried installing both the 10.7.2 client and client combo from Apple's support downloads site, but when I try to run them, I get an error saying it can't be installed:\n\nIs there a way to force Software Update to pull down the update? Or perhaps I could download the one it already installed? I don't think it's actually running 10.7.2, as I also don't have Safari 5.1.1:\n \n\nA: While i haven't seen this problem with Lion, it was common with previous versions of OS X. The way to fix it was to download the Combo updater from Apple, and run the update. Apple provides this for Lion at http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1459, so i'd download that first, run it, and see if it fixes your problem. \n\nA: I was able to resolve it by running the revisioner, thanks in part to @cksum's comment. After running the revisioner, I ran Software Update and it installed the 10.7.2 update.\nHere's what happened:\nI'm an iOS developer. Apple gave WWDC attendees access to the early Lion betas, even if they weren't in the Mac developer program. After beta 6, Apple stopped giving us access to the Lion seeds. So I never had a Lion beta that included a reversioner. The reversioner basically resets the state of the system so the 10.7.2 upgrade package thinks you're running 10.7.1, so it can install over previous seeds.\nI was able to get a copy of the reversioner from a friend in the Mac developer program, and now I'm good to go. \n", "Q: powerbook g4, dead screen and beeps I've a powerbook g4, it should be the \"PowerBook G4 (Gigabit Ethernet)\" named here. It was on the table where I work to gather dust.\nThe screen is dead, but I clearly listen the boot up sound follower by a noise and 3 beeps. I've tried to connect the computer though the DVI port without success, the screen doesn't show anything. Is there any hope to get it working?\nthanks\n\nA: The three beeps is an indication that for some reason it's not been able to successfully pass the RAM check part of the POST, or a bit more seriously that the logic board is dead. First step is to open it up, pull the RAM and boot it, if it makes one beep then it's the RAM so reseat it and see if it works. If it makes three beeps again, then it's a new logic board. \n", "Q: How can I sync Reading List with Windows? Is it possible to use Safari's Reading List on my Windows machine and have it synced with the one on my Mac/iOS devices?\n\nA: According to Apple's support docs, Safari 5.1.1 for Windows will sync the Reading List via iCloud. \n\nSafari 5.1.1 includes support for iCloud, a breakthrough set of free cloud services. iCloud stores your Safari bookmarks and Safari Reading List and automatically pushes them to all your devices.\n\nI believe you would need to have Safari up to date. Then, install the iCloud Windows control panel and configure it to sync Safari content. \n\nThen, enable iCloud on all of your Mac/iOS devices, and you should be good to go. \n", "Q: How can I make AirFoil detect the speaker without rebooting the Mac? When my Mac goes to sleep, and I awake it, AirFoil no longer detects my Airport Expert speakers.\nI always need to restart OS X to make AirFoil detect it; restarting AirFoil doesn't fix it.\nDo you know how could I avoid this?\n\nA: I am not sure, but does Airfoil have a Helper application running in the background? Maybe you have to quit that one as well instead of just restarting AirFoil?\nAlso, do you have the latest version? I have just checked and the Release Notes on the Rogue Amoeba website have a bugfix in the latest release 4.6.2 from a few weeks ago that seems to match your problem:\nhttp://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/releasenotes.php\n\nAirfoil now disconnects from remote speakers upon sleeping, to prevent error messages on waking.\n\nMaybe that update can solve your problem?\n", "Q: What iOS apps will take pictures and not send them to Photo Stream by default? I'm looking for a way to take pictures without them going into the Photo Stream. Rather than have to remember to toggle it on and off as I adore it for my personal pictures, I'm looking for an app that lets me control this.\nI don't really care if it stores the photos in it's own storage space or somehow can toggle a \"do not send\" status before it gets added to the normal camera roll.\nHas such software been released for iOS?\nI will still want this if Apple releases a way to delete select photos from the stream. I am in the habit of documenting work sites using my phone's camera that I really won't ever want to see in my personal photo stream. I'd rather pay for another app than have to remember to enable/disable the stream in the Settings App before and after a work photo session.\n\nA: Since Photo Stream backs your Camera Roll, any app that uses its own storage space rather than the Roll should do - and I doubt many have been (or can be) updated to backup their own storage to Photo Stream at this early stage.\nI'm a fan of Camera+, myself. It saves photos to its own storage, and lets you push them to the Camera Roll (and, therefore, Photo Stream) if and when you want to.\n", "Q: Is it possible to suppress hidden calendars in iOS 5's notification view? I like seeing my upcoming appointments in the notification view, but I have several subscribed calendars that I generally keep turned off, but keep around so I can reference them when necessary. They're showing up in the notifications and I don't want them to.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge you can't fix this. Hopefully Apple will modify this in an update at some point, but who knows. For now, the notification center is useless to anyone with a complicated calendar system.\n", "Q: How can I add an action to search for the selected Terminal text in Google? I want to be able to add an action to search Google with any selected text in Terminal. Any ideas?\n\nA: You could use the one that's built into iTerm2 … (which is a viable replacement for Terminal anyway, if you don't know it yet)\n\n\nA: You can enable the corresponding service in Preferences/Keyboard.\nDefault key assignment is Shift-Command-L which I had to change because it was already used by something else.\nAfter enabling the service you can initiate a Google search in Terminal by selecting a text and\n\n\n*\n\n*press the shortcut key\n\n*select the service in the context menu (Services/Search with Google)\n\n\nOnly drawback is that the search always opens Safari even if you have different default browser.\n", "Q: iTunes Smart Playlist - currently playing track Is it possible to include the currently playing track in a smart playlist?  \nUltimately, what I'm after is a smart playlist that includes tracks without a rating and tracks that I've already rated 3-5.  If I rate something 1 or 2, I want it to keep playing until the end of the song instead of just automatically kicking it out of the playlist and skipping to the next song.\n\nA: I think there's a two-step solution to this:\nFirst create a smart playlist for tracks that are unrated or have 3-5 stars.\nSecond, set that playlist as the source for iTunes DJ, and play tracks using that. Last I checked, tracks would play through even if they wound up getting tagged in mid-play in a way that would remove them from the smart playlist.\n", "Q: Short battery life on a brand new iPhone Well I got my iPhone 4 about a week ago. When I got it I did several full charging cycles, 3-5 if I remember correctly. And these days an iPhone battery really seemed \"unkillable\". It was really hard to drain about 50% with wifi and 3g internet, games, photos and videos, music, and several different apps.\nBut now I experience something strange: my battery drops 30% by night (just locked screen), and when I use my iPhone not so hard as first days (just music and Safari), battery has only 30% remaining (out of 100%) in 5 hrs.\nWell, it's very bad. I don't want to charge my iPhone twice a day.\nAlso, when I leave my iPhone charging for night (I know it can fully charge in 1 hr), I see 93% in the morning. And it doesn't increase.\nSo, as I said I calibrated my battery several times when got an iPhone, and now battery drains super-fast. Can anybody tell me what's wrong and what should I do to make my battery work as expected (at least 10-15 hrs on hard usage, but 20+ hrs will be welcome :D)?\nHope to hear the solution. I tried setting it up as new already :/\n(The original question is on Apple Disscussion Forum https://discussions.apple.com/message/16420171)\n\nA: Since you've tagged your question with iOS 5, I'm assuming you've updated.

I have set it up with no problem on my iPhone. However, on my MacBook Pro it does not work: the icon under \"Default Account\" (next to the account name) remains yellow.\nI tried setting up a Gmail account on the Mac Outlook and that worked with no problem.\nWhat could be wrong?\nI have set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Account description\n\n*Full name\n\n*E-mail address\n\n*Method (User Name and Password)\n\n*User name\n\n*Password\n\n\nUnder \"Advanced\" I also entered the Server.\nThe OS is Mac OS X version 10.7.1.\n\nA: Outlook 2011 requires an Exchange 2007 and above server. This is because Outlook 2011 works over the Exchange Web Services protocol (EWS). This wasn't Apple's decision, but Microsoft, as it is the latest form of the Exchange service as they are phasing out MAPI, the legacy Exchange protocol. Apple's Exchange implementation in 10.6 and 10.7 also uses EWS. \niOS devices however connect to Exchange via ActiveSync, which is supported all the way back to Exchange 2003. ActiveSync is designed for mobile devices and does not work on a desktop system. \n", "Q: Cannot Activate iPhone in iTunes I've restored an iPhone 3G (purchased outside the US) and am trying to activate it with iTunes (in the US with an ATT sim). The iPhone tells me to connect to itunes, with an unlock for emergency calls.\nWhen I connect to iTunes, all I get is a plain white window with the word iPhone in it (can't show image; I'm new).\nI've tried with iPhone-activated SIM cards and not, and also tried activating without a SIM card at all (iTunes tells me to put a SIM in).\n\nA: I recommend going into full recovery mode.  Instructions are here: iPhone and iPod touch: Unable to update or restore.  A summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the USB cable from the iPhone or iPod touch, but leave the other end of the cable connected to your computer's USB port.\n\n*Turn off the device: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a few seconds until the red slider appears, then slide the slider. Wait for the the iPhone or iPod touch to turn off.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you cannot turn off the device using the slider, press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time. When the device turns off, release the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons.\n\n\n*While pressing and holding the Home button, reconnect the USB cable to iPhone. When you reconnect the USB cable to iPhone, the device should power on.\nNote: If you see the screen pictured below, let the device charge for at least ten minutes to ensure the battery has some charge and then start with step 2 again.\n\n\n*Continue holding the Home button until you see the \"Connect to iTunes\" screen. When this screen appears you can release the Home button:\n\n\n*If necessary, open iTunes. You should see the following \"recovery mode\" alert:\n\n\n*Use iTunes to restore the device.\n\nA: If iTunes/the phone are saying there is no SIM installed when there is there may be a problem with the SIM card or the phone. These are some steps I'd suggest to help troubleshoot:\n\n\n*\n\n*First you should try reseating the SIM by removing the tray, making\nsure the card is nicely position and reinserting it.\n\n*Second, I would request a new SIM from the mobile network or use a SIM you know to be working. \n\n*Third I would take the phone to an Apple store for repair/replacement (although this is unlikely to be free).\n\n\nIt is worth asking the question: is your phone definitely unlocked for the ATT network?\nI should also state that I'm not sure whether there are any differences between an USA iPhone and one purchased outside the USA.\n", "Q: Does Gmail push on iPhone 4S? I just got the iPhone 4S, and it seems like my email is polling rather than push.  I set up my Gmail account, and emails do not come to my phone instantly.  It appears to be polling, rather than pushing.  I see, on average, about a 10 minute delay between when I see my email in my browser and when it comes to my phone.\nDoes Gmail push on this device, or have I set something up incorrectly?\n\nA: In iOS 6, I changed my Google accounts setup from Exchange to IMAP to test them, and I think they're not compatible with Push. If you go to \"Settings\", and then to \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" inside iOS, you can go to \"Fetch new data\" to enable Push, but, if you go to \"Advanced\" (within \"Fetch new data\"), you can see, one by one, how iOS will get mail from each account, and only the iCloud account is Push enabled, but not the others, so the only option is to set them up using Exchange method :(. The weird thing is that, in Mountain Lion, using the default Gmail method, you get push email, so I don't understand it yet :(\nHere's a guy explaining the problem and the Exchange method:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g107DStzN8Y\n\nA: If you setup your Gmail account as IMAP, it is not pushed. If you setup your Gmail account as an Exchange account, then it will be. The instructions on how to do this are found on this page. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Pushing works out of the box for\n\n\n*\n\n*MobileMe\n\n*iCloud \n\n*Exchange\n\n*Yahoo!\n\n\nWith Google you have the option to set up the account (on your iDevice) as an Exchange account which then gets pushed as well. Setting it up as Gmail gives you polling (like all other providers). \n\nA: The push feature doesn't seem to work for emails to which you have rules created for. For example, when I created a rule that transferred all emails from X sender to a specific folder - Outlook will create a folder and Gmail will create a folder/label but this doesn't get pushed to my iPhone - it appears that only emails in the main inbox get pushed. I made sure that all folders get pushed in my exchange email settings too. \n", "Q: Is Wifi enabled in iOS 5 even when the device is put to sleep? I've been under the impression that iOS shuts down WiFi when the screen is off - which is good as far as battery savings.\nLately I've been suspecting that WiFi remains on, and I did a test. My iPhone's screen has been off for like 15 minutes. I opened iTunes and did a WiFi Sync, it worked! Does that mean my WiFi is on 24/7??\nThanks\nEDIT: I don't have a data plan and I selected cellular data OFF. Maybe it's related?\n\nA: iOS 4\nIf the phone is connected to a power source, then Wifi remains enabled, even if the phone goes to sleep. If the phone is not connected to a power source, then Wifi is disabled once the phone goes to sleep.\nThis of course was by design in an effort to reduce battery consumption.\niOS 5\niOS 5 looks to have altered the behaviour of the device. If iTunes wireless syncing is enabled and iTunes is running, the device will listen to any Wifi connection and wake for it (even SSH, which requires a jailbreak to install). I've tested the device with iTunes not running and it indeed behaves as it did in the previous iteration of iOS, refusing to allow a connection through SSH until I woke the device.\nHowever, it seems this is not consistent. Leaving the phone unconnected and iTunes running, I started an SSH session and began transferring some files. When the phone went to sleep, the connection was lost. So it looks like the answer is \"yes, but don't count on it?\" Clearly iTunes wireless syncing throws us a curveball here.\n\nA: I think you'll find that the 4S is awake on WiFi for 10 seconds in every 4 minutes (240 seconds) irrespective of the iTunes Sync setting.\nThis can be tested by opening a DOS prompt on a Windows machine (or in Terminal on OS X) connected to the same network as your iPhone WiFi.\nFind out the IP address allocated to your phone (on phone > Settings > Wi-Fi > {network name} > IP Address\nType the following command (example):\nping 192.168.1.123 -t \n\n(where the number is the IP address of the phone and -t means keep pinging; on OS X, omit the -t as it isn't needed)\nWait and you'll see a burst of responses for 10 seconds every 230 seconds (230 + 10 = 240 = 4 minutes)\n\nA: pretty sure iOS 4 shuts off wifi when screen is in lock. How do I know? because I went over my limit a few times like that and I called in AT&T and they confirmed the feature for me. I'm not about to risk paying more by testing if that's the case again... but should have been mentioned or featured when iOS 5 came out by someone.\n\nA: Seems to be the case according to chksum, with some additional details.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone reverts to 3G when in standby (iOS, any version).\n\n*iPhone will maintain Wi-Fi if looking for iTunes Wi-Fi Sync over network (iOS 5).\n\n*iPhone will maintain Wi-Fi if an app that requires Wi-Fi is active (apps can maintain the Wi-Fi connection even when in sleep mode by using the UIRequiresPersistentWiFi API flag available to developers.\n\n*When Music: iTunes Home Sharing is enabled (makes sense).\n\n*When playing music\n\n*A guess: when iPod touch must wake up and use wifi for scheduled 15/30/60-minute Fetch requests, or when iPod touch uses Push connections to servers.\n\n\n(see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8850551/uirequirespersistentwifi-equivalent-for-cellular-connection)\nSo essentially, the iPhone maintains a wifi connnection when it needs to because of Apple services (wifi-sync) or a third party app says to.\nI noticed this phenomenon myself the other day when I restored my iPhone to factory settings - previously I always used wifi-sync, but today I decided to use wired-only and so it was interesting to see this old behavior again.\nI recall setting up my friend's iPod touch and listening to it chime every 10 minutes or so (which may have been 15, psychologically speaking I didn't time it, as that was before such issues occurred to me.)\nMusic seems very interesting. I wiped/restored my iPhone clean to reconfirm my observations and the results below seem consistent.\n\n\n*\n\n*If I play music and lock my iPhone (set a nearby Terminal to ping the IP per Hackencrash's instructions) the iPhone will maintain its Wi-Fi connection indefinitely (past the normal 15sec timeout). This happens regardless of whether the app is in the foreground or background when I lock the phone.\n\n*If you pause the music, after 15 secs Wi-Fi will time out as normal.\n\n*If you then resume the music OR play music (using Apple Earbud Controls) from a locked iPhone, the Wi-Fi will stay asleep.\n\n*If something causes wifi to reactivate while asleep (ex. incoming email over push connection) the iPhone will wake Wi-Fi and will stay active as in (1).\n\nA: Your observation is correct: the WiFi is on 24/7 unless you turn it off. I, too, remember this not being the case awhile ago, but I believe that WiFi always-on has been the case since iOS 4 at least.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts for dynamic menu items (Keynote) I often find myself creating Keynote presentations with lots of extra slides.  I then go through and skip a bunch for a particular class.\nTo make this slide choice easier, I added a keyboard shortcut for the \"Skip Slide\" and \"Don't Skip Slide\" menu commands.  Unfortunately, they don't work consistently.  In fact, it only seems that one at a time will work, which I think is a function of the fact that the menu item changes based on whether the selected slide is set to be skipped or not.\nIf a slide is selected that is hidden, the \"Slide\" menu will show \"Don't Hide Slide.\"  If I look at the menu by clicking \"Slide,\" then the \"Don't Hide Slide\" keyboard shortcut will work.  But, then if I select a slide is that is not hidden, the \"Hide Slide\" keyboard shortcut won't work.  I can get it to work by opening the \"Slide\" menu (where I can verify that it shows \"Hide Slide\" and my keyboard shortcut).  But, after that, the \"Don't Hide Slide\" keyboard shortcut stops working.  \nMy question then: How do I get to use a keyboard shortcut for a menu item that is not in the menu at a particular time?\n\nA: This doesn't solve the general case problem of how to assign a keyboard shortcut for any dynamic menu item, but it does solve the specific problem of having a keyboard shortcut to hide or display slides in Keynote.\nWe can work around the shortcut problem because Keynote is AppleScriptable.\nCreate a new service in Automator.\nThe service takes no input in Keynote.app.\nThe service has a single action: Do AppleScript. The script (in all its one-line beauty) is:\ntell application \"Keynote\" to tell current slide of the front slideshow to set skipped to not skipped\n\nSave the service as \"ToggleSkipped\".\nUse the Keyboard Shortcuts tab within the Keyboard pane of System Preferences to bind the service to an unused keystroke.\n", "Q: Is otool available in a stock OS X installation with no Xcode? Is /usr/bin/otool available in a stock OS X installation where Xcode hasn’t been installed?\n\nA: No, it's part of the CLI Developer Tools package in the XCode download:\nandy:/Volumes/Xcode and iOS SDK/Packages$ pkgutil  --payload-files DeveloperToolsCLI.pkg |grep otool\n./usr/bin/otool\n./usr/share/man/man1/otool.1\n\n", "Q: Any way to make Cmd-D \"delete next word\" rather than \"split-pane\" in Terminal I am so used to using ⌘D to \"delete-next-word\" in emacs and xterm, that I automatically hit it in Terminal all the time, which rather annoyingly (to me, at least) causes the pane to split instead. I've tried to google solutions, but all I get are hits telling me what a neat feature this is.\nI could just use XTerm under X11, but Terminal plays more nicely with some of my favorite Mac utilities (notably Divvy). I've tried iTerm2, but at best I can get it to ignore ⌘D, not actually erase the word.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Switch to iTerm2. It's free and sooo much nicer than plain old terminal. Also it has a lot more options for customization, like keyboard shortcuts.\nAlso I love that you can use cmd and 1-9 to switch between tabs. Try it and you will never go back to regular terminal :)\nHow to set up delete next word in iTerm 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Install iTerm2\n\n*Launch and then go to preference pane.\n\n*Choose the \"Keys\" tab\n\n\n*Click on the plus button to add a new keyboard shortcut\n\n*In the first box type CMD+D\n\n*In the second box choose \"Send Escape Sequence\"\n\n*In the third box type the letter d\n\nVoila!

After I bought a new MacBook Pro 2011 with 4 GB or RAM at 1333 MHz I decided to switch the RAM with the one from the old MacMini 8 Gb at 1066 MHz.\nInitially I was expecting to have problems with the MacBook Pro, but it seem to have no problems running with 8GB of RAM at 1066 MHz.\nStill, the surprise came form MacMini which became unstable and unusable (crashes or stops randomly but very often). I am wondering if the RAM is the issue or something else, like cooling.\nHow can I easily detect the source of the problems with the macMini? I mention that the 1333 Mhz worked just fine in the MacBook Pro and I know that it should have no problem using it, theoretically.\n\nA: The Mac mini (mid 2010) is extremely finicky accepting RAM with a faster clock-speed (some work, some don't). You must use 1066 MHz or buy a pair that is known to be free of issue. For some reason that particular model was extremely sensitive to any discrepancy in RAM (many posts on the internet regarding its inability to run under these conditions).\nFor what it's worth, the new Mac mini (mid 2011) do not suffer from the same problem, accepting higher clocked RAM without complaint.\n", "Q: Where are AirDrop temp files located? I started a transfer over AirDrop of a 4GB xcode dmg file. Something happened in the middle of the transfer (3.5GB) and I now have 3.5GB of space missing from my computer. I have restarted the computer and deleted the file in the downloads folder. I tried using grand perspective to find large files but I can't seem to find the location of the temporary airdrop file. Where are these temp files located so that I can delete them.\n\nA: I guess it'd be quite outdated answer, but maybe it will save some time for others\nAirDrop temp files hidden under this path /private/var/folders/, you need to look for folder called exactly like this \"(A Document Being Saved By sharingd)\" in subfolders. \nIn my case it was /private/var/folders/fq/51d9_5dn7hg445wwp5n7kyqm0000gn/T/TemporaryItems/(A Document Being Saved By sharingd)\n\nA: I believe that airdrop transfers directly into your downloads folder.  Should anything happen to interrupt the transfer, you will likely end up with a file called \"transferred_file.txt.download\", the file is renamed to remove the .download upon completion.  If you have any .download files sitting there and not changing in size, they are failed downloads and can potentially be restarted (if they originated from Safari), or removed.\nYou can test this by transferring a new large file, and watching the file get created, increase in size, then get renamed.\n", "Q: Unable to change Apple ID on my iPhone I changed the e-mail address linked to my Apple ID. Now when I try to update apps or purchase them on my iPhone 4, the old address pops up asking me for the password. I cannot seem to get it to change on my phone. I can log into iTunes and purchase apps there on my computer without difficulty.\nI heard some people say that your iTunes ID is different than your Apple one, But I cannot see (or find) a separate iTunes ID... when I click on my account for iTunes, it shows me my Apple ID. Any ideas?  Anyone know why it will not change on my phone but will in the computer?\nI downloaded and installed iOS 5. I have already tried syncing my iPhone.\n\nA: Your iTunes ID is the same as your Apple ID. I've recently switched email addresses as well, so I can confirm that you can easily change the email address.\nAssuming that you've already successfully changed your Apple ID, follow the steps that Hand-E-Food mentions:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n\n*Select Store (near the bottom of the section starting with General)\n\n\n*Click on your (old) Apple ID\n\n\n*Click on Sign Out\n\n\n*Click on Sign In\n\n\n*Click on Use Existing Apple ID\n\n\n*Sign in with your new Apple ID email address and password\nThat's all there is to it!\n\nA: I've seen several instances of ID issues pertaining to changing IDs. Here are the TWO places in which you can sign in/out.\nAs previously mentioned, you can go to your settings, then general, then store - sign out there. \nNext, I would launch the App Store - go to featured, scroll all the way down to the bottom  and sign out there as well.\nNow you can go to settings, general, store  and sign in with the ID you want to use. There is one caveat. If you've used a previous ID and apps associated with that ID are on your device, you will still be prompted to enter the password for that ID if the App Store attempts any updates. \nThe best thing to do in this case is to re-download/purchase apps using the newer ID. This also involves removing the older apps from the device AND from your iTunes library (in iTunes just under \"Music\" you'll see apps - these are all stored locally on your computer and could sync back to your device, causing the older Apple ID requests). \nOf course, if you're backing up to the cloud, this step is a bit moot. But good to know. Hope this helps.\n\nA: On your iPhone, go to Settings, Store (near the bottom), Apple ID, Sign Out.  I'm not willing to sign out on mine to see what you need to do next, but I'm sure you can work it out from there.  :-)\n\nA: If you've switched Apple IDs recently, that may be causing a problem: you can only change what account your iPhone is authorized to once every three months or so.\n", "Q: Copy & Paste photos between albums Is there a way to copy an entire photo (not just a shortcut to the photo) from your camera role to another photo album?  Now that we can edit photots on the iPhone I thought it might be useful to make a copy of a photo before messing with it.\nAfter selecting a photo and hitting \"copy\", there doesn't appear to be a way to paste it into another album.  Selecting the \"add to\" option, and adding it to another album does appear to work; however, editing the photo in one album affects both the original photo, and the \"copy\" of it.  \nIs there any way to make a copy of the actual photo, and paste it in another album? \n\nA: As you are asking for any way:\n\n\n*\n\n*select photo you wish to duplicate\n\n*Press \"Share\" and \"Email Photo\"\n\n*Send email to yourself using actual size of picture\n\n*Once email is back select picture and save to Photo Roll\n\n\nPS: I tried to just cancel the email first and keeping a copy in Drafts. But it seems you can't select a picture out of a mail in the Drafts folder.\n\nA: I'm not particularly fond of this answer but it does work... you can purchase the Pastebot application (all their apps are fantastic) and copy the image in the native Photo app.  Next open Pastebot and you should see your image pop into the display.  Select the image preview which will open the full image.  At the bottom, click save image and you'll now have two copies of the image.\nJust had the same issue as you and this was the workaround I used (I had already purchased Pastebot).\n\nA: I've been trying to find answers to the same question and I guess I will settle for the email workaround. A screenshot won't work since I want to save a full-resolution copy. I do like that edits are reversible, but sometimes I'd like to save, in my camera roll, both the original and the edited version.\n\nA: This works for copy and Paste. BUT THIS WILL STILL EDIT ALL VERSIONS.\nBut before you do any of this make sure there is at least one image already in the copy to Album.  If the Album is empty you will never see the paste contextual menu.\n1, Go to an Album.  Press the Select button and select the image.\n2,Press the share button.\n3, choose the 'Copy' button.\n4, Go to you other Album. \n5, hold your thing down on the Album page until the Paste contextual menu appears.\n6, Now paste the image.\n\nThe interesting thing is if you have iPhoto you can use the Share button and open in another app. This includes Camera Roll. Which then adds a real copy to the Camera Roll.\n\nA: Screen shot the picture.......\n", "Q: iMessage message routing I had a question on how iMessage message routing works.\nAssume this setup:\nThing1: \niPhone 555-555-5555\nApple ID: thing1@me.com\nThing2:\niPhone: 999-999-9999\nApple ID: thing2@me.com\nIf Thing1 sends a new iMessage and selects Thing2's Cell as the destination, the iMessage appears only on Thing2's iPhone.\nIf Thing1 sends a new iMessage and selects Thing2's email address as the destination, then the iMessage appears on Thing2's iPad and iPhone (and at this point, there's two separate conversations from Thing1 on Thing2's iDevices).\nI had assumed that since the Apple iMessage servers know that Thing2 can receive iMessages at both their iPhone and iPad (via their Apple ID) that it wouldn't matter if the iMessage was addressed to either cell or email (and that iMessage would route it to all associated devices).\nIs that not correct?\n\nA: You are assuming Thing2's iPad and iPhone are both acting as 'Thing2'. That is only partially true. Assuming the iPad is WiFi capable only, it can only receive messages on its e-mail addresses (the address of the iTunes account or other e-mail addresses). The iPhone, however, can receive messages at its phone number or linked e-mail addresses.\nNow when an iMessage is sent to a phone number, the message will only appear on the iPhone as the iPone is only capable of receiving those iMessages. The phone number is linked to the iPhone, not to the iTunes account.\n\nA: I partly tested this out last night, I had a iPhone iMessage exchange, but the replies only came to my iPhone, not to my iPad.\nThere may be device context within an ongoing message dialog, however I haven't checked what would've happened if we were using apple ID's instead of cell numbers.\n", "Q: How can I retain volume settings upon plugging in different speakers/headphones? On the rare occasion that I would like to plug in some headphones to my Mac Mini, rather than speakers, I often turn down the volume before plugging them in, because the first \"blip\" is rather loud, and probably isn't good for my headphones. However, upon plugging them in, the volume will revert to 100%, and I often get an unpleasant pain in the ear because of it. Is there any way to make the volume stay where it was before?\n\nA: As far as I can tell, the Mac maintains two volume settings: one with headphones connected and another without headphones connected. If the volume is turned down with headphones connected, it should save that setting the next time headphones are connected.\nThat said, if your concern is that the \"blip\" is too loud, it can be disabled in System Preferences; under Sound » Sound Effects, deselect Play feedback when volume is changed.\n\n", "Q: Hyperlinks missing in printed documents I've noticed this on several occasions where I'll print a document (Pages file, RTF, PDF, etc) and any hyperlinks in the document don't appear on the printed page. Where the hyperlinked text appears on screen it turns blue with an underscore (as expected), but on the printed page a white gap is left where the text should be as if the font has been changed to white.\nIs this a known issue? This bug has become apparent to me since upgrading to OS X 10.7. I recently updated to 10.7.2 in hope that it would be resolved in that release but it wasn't. The only way I can find around this is to remove the hyperlink from the text and re-print the document which isn't great when I want the hyperlinks to look like links to begin with.\nAny ideas on how I can solve this problem and if there's a known fix? I've been unable to find anything on the Apple forums as of yet :(\n\nA: One potential cause of this problem is hardware-related.\nIf you have a color inkjet printer and the blue ink is empty, this could cause the problem you describe. If it happened that you ran out of blue ink at the same time you upgraded, it might appear to be linked to the OS upgrade, but in fact would not be.\n\nA: My issue was driver related, so I'm answering my on question in case it helps others. I downloaded the latest version of the printer drivers from the manufacturer's website and I have not received the issue since.\n", "Q: How can I install Octave with curl support via homebrew? I've installed octave with homebrew (via brew install octave), and it seems to work fine, including gnuplot support.  However, it looks like it's missing curl support.  I'm getting the message \"error: urlread: curl: No error\" when trying to execute str = urlread(url, 'post', params).\nI've tried making homebrew install curl by adding depends_on 'curl' to the octave formula and setting the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables to point to homebrew curl, but that didn't seem to change anything.\n\nA: I had a similar problem a while back that was caused by having my proxies set up funny. I ended up disabling them to get it to install.\nAlso, are you sure curl is installed correctly? You could try installing it manually as well: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/install.html\n", "Q: Syncing Google Calendars through iCloud I subscribe to a bunch of Google calendars on my iPad, and I have my iPad fully set up with iOS 5 and iCloud. The only calendars that are currently syncing with iCloud are Reminders—is there any way I can also sync my Google calendars?\nOther info: the Google calendars are a mix of read/write and read-only.\n\nA: Your Google Calendars won't sync with iCloud. The two are entirely unrelated services. However, you can do a couple of things as a pseudo work-around. \nIn one sense, if you have your Google Calendars on the iPad, they'll automatically sync with Google calendar and any other device that's configured to read the calendar.\nAnother option is to use something like BusyCal to combine the Google and iCloud calendars. I wouldn't recommend this, as it's a much better idea to keep the data from the two services seperately. \nYour main decision is to which will be your main calendar. It's solely a personal preference, as both calendars will largely give you the same functionality. If you prefer editing your calendars on the web, maybe stick with Google calendar. If you want to be able to share calendars with other iCloud users, move to iCloud calendars.\n\nA: Go to Settings-> Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then under Contacts, select default Account to be \"iCloud\", instead of the Exchange.\n", "Q: Hide specific calendars from Notification Center I currently have five Calendar events displaying in Notification Center at a time. However, I have one specific calendar that I'd like to hide from it, as it has too many events for the Calendar-in-Notification-Center setup to be useful. As far as I've been able to surmise from my tinkering in settings, there's no way to do this. Has anyone else been able to find one?\n\nA: You could use a 3rd party calendar app just for their notification functions as a bodgy workaround.\nI recommend Calvetiva, Agenda, or Tempus.\nThe workflow would go something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a secondary calendar app.\n\n*Configure you secondary calendar app to only use the calendars you want alerts for (steps vary on choice of app). Some (like Calvetica) are clever, and extend the alerts function by allowing a snooze option etc.\n\n*Configure secondary calendar alerts and notifications via the normal settings> notifications app to show as you want them.  They will only trigger for the active calendars in the app.\n\n*Configure your normal calendar alerts to be off.  Remove from Notification Centre, set alert style to none, and also go onto Sounds > alerts and set the calendar alert to none.\n\n\nNow your existing calendar app will still have access to all calendars but won't alert, the secondary app will do alerting only for the active ones.\nDownsides:  You will need to periodically open and then shut the secondary calendar every so often in order for it to read the current alerts from the calendar data store and create it's own local notifications from them.  \nI hoped you could get round this by following the above steps but using the built in calendar as your selective alerting calendar (as it is always running and won't need to be opened to update), and using a replacement calendar app with all calendars shown but no alerts - sadly the normal Calendar app includes all calendars regardless of if you have turned a calendar off or not.\n\nA: On my jailbroken iPhone, I make use of LockInfo.\nWith LockInfo, you not only get notification center on the lock screen, you have more control over what notification center does.\nAnd relating directly to your question, with this plugin, you can navigate to:\nSystem Settings -> LockInfo -> Notifications and Widgets -> Calendar -> Calendars; and select which appear. \n\nA: This app can do exactly what is needed here : you can choose which calendars to display on its Notification Center widget !\nAgenda+ | Calendar & Reminder Widget\nIt also displays all day events.\n", "Q: Adding music to an iphone from multiple computers My iPhone is currently managed on my macbook, where I've added my music library from iTunes onto the phone.  However, I want to also be able to add music from my PC to the iPhone, without erasing the rest of my music. Whenever I try to do this, it threatens to delete the rest of my library. \nHow do I add music from multiple computers?\n\nA: It seems that iTunes Home Sharing would fit the bill for what you're trying to do. Here's the link for the basic requirements. I've done this before myself to consolidate my music library from several different machines. Since you own both machines, you should have no problem sharing your library from your PC to your Mac, and then just syncing from your Mac. However, both machines are required to be using the same local network.\n", "Q: How do I get my iTunes \"Album Artwork\" to add to the individual files instead of \"~/Music/iTunes/Album Artwork/\" iTunes saves Album Artwork to ~/Music/iTunes/Album/Artwork/Cache/[some seemingly random folder name here]/\nThe problem is that if I move actual MP3 and AAC files from this computer (and/or iTunes database) to another one, I (assume that I) will lose the connection between those songs and the cached artwork.\nRight now there is 826 MB worth of of cached images in 950+ files.\nI am almost certain that it is possible to add album art directly to the media files, but I need a solution which can be automated (at least most of it) because I really don't want to do this 950+ times, and I have a lot more music to clean up in the future.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*\n\n*[Non-free solutions are entirely welcome, but please let me know if your proposed solution isn't free, and how much it costs, if you know.]\n\n\n*I have both MP3 and AAC files, so hopefully any solution will work on either kind of files.\n\n\nA: Check out this AppleScript from the excellent dougscripts.com: Re-Embed Artwork v.1.0.

I want to take some Matroska (.mkv) movies I have (h.264/AAC with subtitle & chapter tracks) and change the container to the more iOS friendly MP4 container, but without re-encoding all of the media streams. What tool is suitable for doing this?\n\nOther info: I'm using 10.5 PPC.\n\nA: MP4Tools works for this. It does pass-thru of h.264 and audio streams, or you can convert as you see fit. It's free, but $5 to remove the nag screen that pops up any time you open a file, and to get batch operations. I haven't tested it with chapters and subs, but I think it can deal with them fine. \nOne word of caution: if you have files with AC3 audio that you want to leave in as a 2nd channel, it has an option to do pass-thru of that, and add a stereo AAC track, but it doesn't re-order them, which can cause issues with QuickTime X/iPad/AppleTV.\nMP4Tools doesn't work for anything below 10.6, so MKVtools is a good alternative for 10.5. Same developer and basic functionality, it should work for your purposes fine.\nThe other option is doing it manually using command line tools, mkvtoolnix to extract the streams from the mkv, and MP4Box to repackage in an MP4. If you need to convert audio to AAC, ffmpeg is the a good starting point, but there are other options. Unless you need a degree of control that MP4Tools doesn't provide, I'd say stay away from the command line stuff. It's useful, but more hassle than it's worth if MP4Tools does what you need.\nAnother good tool is Subler, which is a nice tagging program. Unfortunately lacking a batch mode, but it's otherwise very good - much faster at writing the tags than other programs I've tried. And as long as the files have season & episode numbers, the tag auto-lookup works great.\n", "Q: What is the best phonetic app for the iPad? I'm not a native english speaker and so I'm looking for an app to teach my 4 year old daughter with spelling and speaking. She's speaking English very well and very confident in communicating with her friends in English. \nHowever, her teacher is saying that her phonetic is not quite good yet. She's missing some sound, eg. 'p' vs 'b'. Also, she's not good in dictating exercise, meaning writing down word when others read it to her.\nSo my question is what will be the best app for my daughter? \nMy daughter loves SuperWhy show but I'm not sure if their app is good. I wonder if anyone can list his/her favorite app here so we can vote on them.\n\nA: This is a little left field from the answers you requested, but I would suggest turning on the feature to allow screen reading in the accessibility settings area, which allows any app that uses a standard text area that can be cut/paste to be read aloud.  In this way as she encounters test in any app, she can have portions of it read to her, and the diction is pretty good as a rule, allowing her to learn by real world example.\n\nA: I found Phonemica very good :)\n", "Q: Are there any good iPad games for kids to learn numbers? I'm looking for iPad games for my 4 year old daughter to learn numbers. I've tried many different games, like \"Learn Numbers\", \"Counting101\", \"Animals Count\", \"Baby Phone\", etc. but none of them are really good. They are either too simple, too hard or too boring.\nI'm looking for something that is interactive, fun, and that my daughter can play by herself without asking me what the questions are (some games have questions written but not spoken out loud). She has learned all of the single digit numbers although sometimes she makes random mistakes with them. She doesn't know about two-digit numbers except 10, 11 and 12. If there is a game with princesses it would be perfect for her :)\nCould someone here please let me know, what is a good game to try out? If possible, please describe why you think it's good.\nMany thanks.\nEDIT: I got the first answer for this question after my daughter has mastered numbers until 20. I think it's good for her right now. I don't try push her much at this age. So I accept Numberland since it's the first answer although it seems to be too simple at the first glance. I didn't try other apps yet but will give them a try later. Thank you all for your effort.\n\nA: You can try Numberland (App Store). It's available in 3 languages: English, French and Spanish. It won a Parents' Choice award in Fall 2011.\nCheck out the video demo.\n\nA: My daughter has played with Math Express\nNo unicorn, nor Princess but a train with a lot of animals.\n\nA: Think you could turn to bestappsforkids.com, well gathers many cool games for kids, such as I got Want My lollipop and Tom's Travels from there, which are my nephew's favorite game now. \n\nA: I saw a notice of \"Math Bingo\" the other day.

I have an old iPhone 2G (first generation) that I plan on using basically as an iPod touch (not using the phone portion).  I no longer have the AT&T service on that phone.  I installed an update to the firmware (stupidly) this morning because iTunes prompted me too... and now the phone seems to basically be bricked.  Upon completing the firmware update I was stuck at the \"connect to iTunes/emergency\" screen.\nFor the past 10 hours, I have tried to restore, I have booted into DFU mode. I have even resorted to attempted jailbreaks, all to no avail.  No matter what I do, I still get that \"connect to iTunes/emergency\" screen, and while the \"iPhone\" displays under Devices in iTunes, the iTunes page simply says \"iPhone\". There is no Summary Page, no iPhone section, no version section, no backup section, etc.\nI installed iTunes 10.5 and I am pretty sure the firmware for the 2G phone is 1.1.3 (although I had attempted to roll it back).\nDoes anyone have any ideas on why this is happening and what can be done to get this iPhone back up and running?\n\nA: Jailbreaking is the easiest way to kill the activation process, fortunately for you the 2G is cracked on such a low level is a one shot process there's a guide up on iClarified how to do it. \nAfter that you should go have a look at which is a jailbroken firmware with a lot of the features that the iPhone 2G ended up missing out on.\n\nA: Your phone is restored and updated to new firmware, to activate the phone you need to have AT&T service. \nPlan B: Jailbreak it with Cydia. It will unlock your phone and you can use it with other service providers. There are many videos on youtube to guide you.\n", "Q: Are there disadvantages to using different Apple IDs for iCloud and Store purchases? Apple provides instructions for configuring one Apple ID for iCloud and a different Apple ID for Store purchases. But this is clearly not the \"recommended\" approach.\nIs there a reason to avoid doing this? Are there disadvantages, such as lost integration, or omitted features that result from using different IDs for iCloud and Store purchases?\n\nA: As of right now, there are no disadvantages. In fact, my fiancée and I do this right now. We share an AppleID for store purchases and set up Home Sharing so that our iPads and MacBooks can share apps, but we have separate iClouds on our machines and everything works fine. \n", "Q: Can iCloud help me move iTunes to a new Computer (Mac to PC)? I'm upgrading my wife's laptop from an old MacBook to a newer windows based laptop (thanks for the free laptop, Telus).  I believe you can manually copy everything in the 'iTunes' folder over (I know this works Mac -> Mac, never tried to a PC), but I'm curious if this process can be done by iCloud? or is iCloud purely for synchronization of content for iOS 5 based devices?\nThe line is a bit blurry to me as pretty much everything in iTunes is just content for the iPhone now.\n\nA: Short answer: no. Longer answer: maybe, but probably not yet. Most of the iCloud pieces integrated into iTunes are for iTunes/App Store content. You can re-download all your purchased music and TV (not sure about movies yet?), but it doesn't sync playlists, and outside of the US (guessing you're in Canada given the Telus mention) you're out of luck at the moment due to separate content deals. Eventually with iTunes Match, you'll be able to get non-iTunes music from iCloud for a fee ($25/year), but it's not coming until November in the US, and later for the rest of us. It's not clear how iTunes Match will deal with playlists, but if it's like the current system for transferring purchased music, it probably won't sync playlists, just give you all the music in one heap.\nYour best bet is to just copy your iTunes directory (~/Music/iTunes on the Mac), including the iTunes Library.itl and .xml files to the default iTunes folder on your new PC. If you don't already have all your media files in the iTunes directory, you'll probably want to do that if you have the space, to make things simpler when transferring. iTunes will do the rearranging for you, just go to File→Library→Organize Library and check Consolidate files.\n", "Q: How do I use FTP via the command line to download all files? I tried to use Filezilla and Cyberduck for file transfer over a simple FTP server. The problems I have is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filezilla: When I use it for file transferring, I check the \"Activity Monitor\", the \"% CPU\" usage is like 150% - 200%. I was shocked. My mac start to become lag, so I stop it.\n\n*Cyberduck: When I download a folder from ftp, about 60mb, inside have small files (*.php, *.jpg etc). It took about 8 hours to download the files(there is a time indication of how much time left in cyberduck). If I use filezilla, it only takes about 1-3 mins. I notice, when using Cyberduck, it keep setting the permissions first, not really transfer the files directly. And it took quite long.\nThus, I went to google, and I found that mac can use Terminal to connect to ftp server and download files.\nftp hostname\nmget * (download all the files)\n\nNow, another problem, let say, in my ftp I have:\n- blog(folder)\n    - php(folder)\n    - img(folder)\n- others folder\n\nI want to download \"blog\" and its subsequent folders and files. Can I do it in 1 command line? If no, how do you download my \"blog\" folder?\nI remember in unix/linux command, there is something like this:\n- remove -R blba\n\nwhich remove the folder blba recursively (its subsequent folders and files), I wonder if mac's terminal ftp command can support this.\nPlease advise \n\nA: The curl program could help you download an FTP file, but it specializes in one-off URLs (http, ftp, etc). It is possible to use Perl to script something up to list then download, but its much easier to use wget! \nHowever, wget is not a standard program of OSX so you will need to manually download, compile, and install it (relatively easy task, as long as you have Xcode installed.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Xcode from the App Store.\n\n*Download wget source\n\n*Open a Terminal into the directory you saved the source.\n\n\nRun the following commands:\n    $ tar xfvz wget-latest.tar.gz\n    $ cd wget-*\n    $ ./configure && make\n\nThe wget binary will be produced in a src subdirectory. From here you can run the binary directly as ./src/wget or install into /usr/local/bin:\n    $ sudo make install\n\nNow, you only need to run wget -r  ftp://username:passwd@server/path/to/download and your FTP site will be recursively downloaded from that path!\nJust remember that the /path/to/download is relative to the username you login with... and FTP passwords are notoriously unsecure :)\n\nA: If you want to proceed without Xcode you may also use curlmirror which builds on curl which is already supplied with OSX. In case you get the script from the web site linked above, you have to rename the first line to #!/usr/bin/perl in a text editor of your choice.\n\nA: the standard ftp doesn't have \"recursive download\" functionality. but ncftp has.  Please try it.\n\nA: I suggest you switch to the latest snapshot build of Cyberduck which should improve download transfer initialization.\n", "Q: How do I get Messages to appear in the Notification Center? I've configured Notifications to display Messages in the Notification Center, but no messages ever appear there.\n\nIs there another setting that I'm missing? Are only certain kinds of messages displayed in the Notification Center?\n\nA: This appears to have been a (temporary) bug that sometimes happened shortly after an app is first configured for Notification Center. The settings indicated in the original question should be sufficient to get messages to appear in Notification Center.\n\nA: Yes, actually there are two things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*First \"View in Lock Screen\" must be ON\n\n*And Messages must be under \"In Notification Center\"\n\n\n\nIf you do these, your messages will be displayed in both Notification Center and the Lock Screen.\n", "Q: Desktop Search - with more features than Spotlight? I am looking for a 'desktop search' solution for the mac. I like the look of HoudahSpot (built on top of Spotlight) but it doesn't quite do everything I would like. \nMy ideal search solution would do all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Index all content of all MS Word documents on an individual computer (and preferably other formats as well, but MS Word is the key one), with ability to exclude certain files, documents and folders \n\n*Ability to have several custom document indexes ie. can ideally set up some content indexes to only contain a smaller subset of documents related to a certain project - not everything on my computer. Or alternatively have 'saved searches'.\n\n*When you do a search for a phrase or term, a list of MS Word documents that contains the search term/phrase is returned. \n\n*An extract with the search term highlighted is displayed for each document returned in the search results list, including some indication if the phrase appears in a document more than once. Viewing the extract within which a term or phrase appears helps context it and give a better idea of if this is the occurrence you are looking for.\n\n*When you click on an item in the search results window that document is opened in its native application ie. MS Word, AND\n\n*All occurrences of the term or phrase are highlighted in the open document, with the first occurrence selected. Ideally have ability to quickly move forward and back between multiple occurrences of the phrase/term within one document.\n\n*An added bonus would be the ability to do 'boolean', 'proximity' and other more advanced searches.\n\n*Tag documents with metadata, and this metadata can be searched on\n\n*Can index and search across multiple locations eg. servers as well as local computer\nAs mentioned, the closest I can find on the mac is the 'HoudahSpot' product, but I think it only does 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8? \nThe other solution that does everything I want is Adobe Acrobat's PDF search functionality, however its only for PDFs. If I could find similar functionality for MS Word documents I'd be really happy! \nMy other option is to move to a full document management solution, but I would probably still need to employ a developer to customize the search functionality to meet all my above needs? I'm not sure what document management system has good search? Also possibly there are limits to Spotlight's underlying design that stops me meeting all of the above requirements through products such as HoudahSpot? Maybe things like hit highlighting within MS Word could just use Word's inbuilt Find function, with the search term being passed to MS Word when the MS Word document is opened?\nAny ideas or advice from anyone would be much appreciated.\n\nA: I don't know of a third party solution, but I do know that Spotlight can do all of those things, except for #6, but that's more of a function of Word than Spotlight. \n\nA: DEVONthink can index specific folders, and supports advanced search operators. It supports most common types of file, including Word documents. \nIt builds its own search indexes (a DEVONthink database can support Spotlight – screen shot below – without relying upon Spotlight). Search is pretty fast. Results are shown within the application. \nPro editions allow multiple databases. Each search is restricted to the open database(s); you can have separate databases indexing different logical collections of files.\nScreen shots from a first run of DEVONthink Pro Office 2.8.11 on pre-release macOS Sierra: \n\n\n\nA: Try Alfred or Quicksilver\nThose apps are amazing :)\n\nA: Full disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahSpot\nHoudahSpot 3 fulfills all requirements set by the original poster.\n\n\n*\n\n*HoudahSpot builds upon the Spotlight index. The MS Word Spotlight importer does a good job with document contents\n\n*HoudahSpot can search several locations at once and exclude locations from search. Searches can be saved as documents or templates for recurring searches\n\n*Yes\n\n*HoudahSpot's text preview shows a text only (no formatting) version of the selected search results. It highlights the different terms you searched for\n\n*Yes\n\n*HoudahSpot passes the first text search term to the application used to open a document. Some applications immediately highlight the found text. Others have you press cmd-G (Find Next) before they do\n\n*Combine criteria using boolean operators. Yes – Advanced searches. Yes –Proximity searches. Sadly not possible\n\n*Open Meta and Mavericks Finder tags\n\n*Any location indexed by Spotlight. This includes mounted drives attached to remote Macs.

I could not find any information searching for this.\n\nA: No, all current Macs have fans. At low load, most Mac fans are very quiet though.\n", "Q: What does FreeMemory actually do? There's a highly-rated app on the Mac App Store called FreeMemory.  It claims to be able to \"increase your free memory with a simple click.\"  Although it's free right now, I believe it normally goes for 99 cents.\nAs a computer scientist, my intuition about the app is that it's almost certainly snake oil; in a modern operating system, anything the app could do would be unnecessary at best and actually harmful to performance at worst.  \nMy best guess is that the app probably does something to cause the system to dump the \"Inactive\" memory, which probably has no effect whatsoever on performance.  However, very little information is provided about the app, and I'm reluctant to install it on my machine.  I'm also not as familiar with OS X as I am with Linux and Windows, so I could be mistaken about how OS X handles RAM.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What exactly does FreeMemory do, and how does it accomplish it?  Is there some public API that can give user-space programs access to the operating system's memory management parameters?\n\n*Could using FreeMemory actually confer a performance boost, or is it snake oil as I suspect?\n\n\nA: Installed and tested, they're running the purge command and freeing up inactive memory. It's not 100% snake oil, there can be situations where OS X doesn't properly release the inactive and starts hitting the disk based swap file (incurring an I/O performance hit), but it's fairly useless for the majority of users.\nAlthough if they're making $0.99 for wrapping a command in a menu bar I really need to get my Mac Developer license.\n\nA: Absolutely nothing other than swindle people out of their money. Don't ask me why Apple approved it. iOS and OS X manage memory as required. A lot of FUD out there claiming it's poor at it. No evidence to support those claims. No facts ever presented. No one with a modicum of experience or education in the field has ever come up (that I've seen) and accredited the claims. Snake oil.\nYou want to improve performance? Buy a better device. Only better hardware can equate to better performance. You can of course optimize a system, but this doesn't do that, it only shifts available memory.\nHere's a breakdown of how to understand memory management in OS X (courtesy of Apple):\n\nFree memory\nThis is RAM that's not being used.  \nWired memory\nInformation in this memory can't be moved to the hard disk, so it must\n  stay in RAM. The amount of Wired memory depends on the applications\n  you are using.  \nActive memory\nThis information is currently in memory, and has been recently used.  \nInactive memory\nThis information in memory is not actively being used, but was\n  recently used.\nFor example, if you've been using Mail and then quit it, the RAM that\n  Mail was using is marked as Inactive memory. This Inactive memory is\n  available for use by another application, just like Free memory. \n  However, if you open Mail before its Inactive memory is used by a\n  different application, Mail will open quicker because its Inactive\n  memory is converted to Active memory, instead of loading Mail from\n  the slower hard disk.\n\nNow even with rudimentary understanding of memory management in Apple's OS, tell me if you think \"freeing up\" Inactive memory is of any use? It is available to any application that requests it and if the same application wants to grab a hold of it again, it gets a speed boost. It's of course not this simple, but razing Inactive memory and moving it to Free memory results in no increase in performance. After all, how could it? A good system should hoard all your memory and allocate it to things that need it. Free memory is wasted memory as it's, by definition, not being used. If you have 8 GB of RAM and keep 4 GB free at all times, then you have a system running 4 GB.\nInactive memory in OS X is allocated intelligently. I'll change my tune when I see valid and reliable data that claims otherwise. And honestly, if nothing else, do you think some third party app has found the holy grail of memory management that has eluded Apple's world class engineers all this time (not to mention the thousands of contributing open-source UNIX programmers)? Like I said, snake oil.\n", "Q: Which iPhone 4S Cases actually fit? Alot of existing iPhone 4 cases are now being marketed as iPhone 4S cases; but I'm not sure that all of them would be compatible with an iPhone 4S. Can anyone who has found a case that fits add it to the answers?\n\nFor example my girlfriend has two Incipio iPhone 4 cases (DermaShot\n  and NGP) and neither of them fit my new iPhone 4S (due to the position\n  of the mute switch and the volume buttons) despite the Incipio site\n  saying that they are iPhone 4S cases.\n\n\nA: Cases that are cut for specifically the iphone 4s or the CDMA version of the iphone 4 should fit the 4s.\nSome iphone 4 cases will fit the original (gsm) version of the iphone and the CDMA version (the cut away around the mute button is large enough to support it in either position, basically). These should also be fine.\nI've got an iphone 4 \"bumper\" from Apple that's been cut for both versions of the iphone 4, and it fits my 4s just fine.\n\nA: I actually went to an AT&T store and asked specifically which of the Otterbox's worked with the new iPhone4s. They pointed me to the Defender series even though the print on the packaging said iPhone4 (Not iPhone4s). The case fits/works great. The nice thing about overpaying for the case at the AT&T store was that I have 30 days to return the case, no questions asked.

Are you running any kind of tool or app accessing iTunes? Menu bar control apps, sync solutions, or maybe an audioscrobbler? If yes, try to quit that first and see if iTunes quits cleanly after that.\n\nA: Looks like your iTunes installation is screwed up.\nFollow this tutorial to uninstall iTunes, it involves\n\n\n*\n\n*killing it using Activity Monitor\n\n*Moving it to the Trash\n\n*Moving the related plist to the Trash.\n\n*Rebooting.\n\n\nThen go there to download the latest version and install it.\nOnce you have done that, see if it's still behaving. Then can (should) update to 10.7.2.\n\nA: I can't replicate this problem, the keyboard shortcut is working fine for me. (iTunes 10.5/141 and Lion 10.7.2).\nHowever, check to ensure iTunes is not in 32-bit mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to iTunes in your Applications folder.\n\n*Click on iTunes, File -> Get Info\n\n*Ensure \"Open in 32-bit mode\" is not enabled\n\n\nFailing that there will surely be something printed to Console.app (Found in Applications/Utilities).

I guess this is normal behavior, but is it possible to avoid the intermediate sparsebundle, while at the same time having a control on the backup size in the iMac ?\n\n\nA: You can set up your iMac as a fully functioning time machine server by purchasing the OSX Lion Server from the Mac App Store.\nThis provides you with an official method free from hacks to allow you to backup individual machines such as macbooks etc to a single target machine.  I backup my Macbook Air to my iMac in this way.  For extra safety, I occassionally clone off this backup volume in the iMac to an external disk and store it out of the house.\n\nA: Rather than create a sparsebundle and mount it, you can mount a shared folder on another Mac using AFP.\nOpen Terminal and run this command editing it appropriately. Make sure the account has appropriate read/write permissions. The destination I am using  is HFS+\nsudo tmutil setdestination afp://user:pass@host/share\n\nAfterwards open System Preferences and you should be able to Start the Backup.  This will automatically create the appropriate sparsebundle on the destination volume.\nCredit: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4137784?tstart=0\n\nA: @Cedric I would avoid keeping the Sparsebundle backups on the same hard disk as the OS,, Time Machine was updated to include Delta Backups for some file types (thouse that support versions I think, rather than all files), and as such a single change to the sparsebundle could require rebacking up the whole file each time.  \nMy suggestion would be to get 2 external drives (of approx twice the size of your combined individual iMac/Macbook drives if possible.  Set Time Machine Server to backup to one of these drives as a single partition which will create Sparebundle backups per machine backed up.  Keep this drive plugged in at all times and keep Time Machine running regularly.  This is your goto backup.restore drive.  Then, clone this drive to another identical drive periodically (depending on how sensitive you are - bear in mind that this backup is your go to drive only if both the original machines and primary backup drive are lost at the same time, i.e. fire or theft rather than hardware failure).  \nThere are many ways to acheive this, Carbon Copy Cloner is a nice one as it will perform a full clone the first operation, and then only do the changes in subsequent operations making it a little quicker than cloning the whole thing at one (Which I belive is what SuperDuper will do, I'm not aware unless it has been updated that it will do incrementals).  I actually use Chronosync for this task, but only because I already own it, and it does the same thing (although I believe CCC is faster).  \nHide this disk in a seperate location to the Time Machine Server and primary backup disk.  There is no point stacking them together and losing all 3 if you get robbed).  I am providing this an an answer even though the previous anser has been accepted purely because it is way to big to be a comment, please do not vote on it.\n", "Q: How can I open a Finder window in Desktop without switching to another one? I have these five desktops with a dozen of full screen apps and feel very happy.  Say I'm at right Desktop 5 now. (Sadly my picture is deleted since it wasn't uploaded to the site hosting service)\nNow I want to open Finder to locate a file to open it on this desktop.\nSo I click Finder in Dock.\n\nOuch!\nI get dragged all the way to the  Desktop 1 because that's where Finder is currently open.\nWell, that makes sense from a programmer's perspective (switch to Desktop with the app window).\nBut it doesn't make any sense for user.\nWhenever I press Finder, I want it to open on current desktop, because it's utility and not really an “app” I need to “switch to”.\nI usually have half dozen Finder windows on different desktops and these redirects just get in my way.\nIs there a workaround to make Finder in Dock desktop-bound, apart from choosing New Finder Window in menu?\n\nA: If you right click on finder in the dock, select \"Options\" then \"All Desktops\".  All Finder windows will be available on all desktops all the time.\nI think its solves the problem posted in the question if you select \"None\"\n\nA: You can make a simple AppleScript application to put in your dock that will make a new Finder window in the current desktop:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    make new Finder window to home\n    activate\nend tell\n\n\nA: Look into HyperDock it has a lot of cool enhancement for the Dock.\nFrom the homepage:\n\nPowerful Shortcuts\nHyperDock adds fully configurable shortcuts to your dock apps.\n  Assign key & mouse shortcuts to your dock items to hide or quit apps, start Expose, open Safari tabs, Finder Windows and much more.\n\n\nYou can also look into TotalFinder, I believe it also has global shortcut allowing you to open a new window from anywhere.\n\nA: You have several different options:\nCreate Finder Window with a Shortcut\n\nWhile this doesn't solve your problem with the dock, using a keyboard shortcut can be much faster and can help in your workflow.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate Finder by clicking the desktop background\n(If the desktop is cluttered with windows, pinch out to clean it up and then click)\n\n*Use the New Finder Window shortcut: ⌘ + N \nDisable Spaces Auto-Switching\nUncheck the Missions Control preferences checkbox to switch to a space with open windows for an application:\n\nOn a side note, this does not effect the Finder if you have the Assign to all Desktops option selected. Link Here\n\nA: There is a very easy way to do this:\nSet a shortcut for Spotlight and use it. I set my spotlight shortcut  to Control + Spacebar (so it doesn't interfere with other apps — especially the Adobe CC app pan & zoom tools). \nWhen I'm in some app and type that key combo I get a Finder window in the same Space I'm already in (not Finder Space) and the cursor is in the search field of the Window. It's in the same space I'm using (Finder needs to be set to All Desktops in Dock> Finder Icon> Options…> All Desktops) overlaid over application I was using.\nSet Spotlight shortcut in System Prefs> Spotlight> Spotlight Window shortcut:\n\nA: Keyboard shortcut Option⌥ + Command⌘ + Space: open new Finder window on the active Desktop\n\n\nA: I found a workable solution to this using BetterTouchTool (which is worth a download for many reasons other than just this use case) that mostly does what I want: 3 finger tapping on the dock icon for Finder, Terminal, Safari, etc opens a new window in the current space. However, it only does the right thing if the app already has other windows open. If the app isn't open, or doesn't already have any open windows, it'll either send the Command-N to the current app while the clicked one is opening, or it'll open up two new windows (once when activated, once for Command-N).  This is a bit of a pain, although maybe not a deal-breaker because a standard left click will do the correct thing where this gesture fails.\n\n\n*\n\n*set up a new gesture of your choice (I'm using 3 finger tap) and assign it to \"Activate Currently Hovered App in Dock\"\n\n*select \"Attach Additional Action\" and assign it to a keyboard shortcut of Command-N\n\n*if, like me, you have 3 finger tap already assigned to middle click (or any other action), you'll want to click the gear icon to the left of the gesture selector to make the Command-N action only trigger when over the dock, and the middle click action only trigger when not over the dock\n\n*make sure to disable spaces auto-switching, as found in Kassym's answer\n\n\nI have a feeling we're only going to get a good fix for this if Apple acknowledges this space-per-task use case, so please send them feedback.\n", "Q: What is the best surface to use the Magic Mouse on? I got the Magic Mouse along with my MacBook, tried using it for awhile, but I got disenchanted with it quickly. Instead of having sliding pads, it has two hard plastic bars, which make it unpleasant to use on most surfaces. I`ve tried it on my wooden table (little bit of dirt scratched it up), paper (too much friction), cloth-covered mousepad (has some issue with correctly tracking), even on the surface of my MacBook (awkward), but none of them seem to be working too good. What surface was the Magic Mouse designed to work on, and which surfaces are really good for using it?\n\nA: Basically you need a gaming surface, some of them was made specially for use with Apple mouses:\nCupertino Mouse Pad — $15\nThey say it's made by company located at Cupertino, California. Also it works (as a surface).\n\n\nMacPadd — $25\nIt's basically just a piece of finished aluminum and I guess it will feel the same as a top surface MacBook.\nTom'sHardware says that something's weird with their delivery, but maybe it's b.s. It's also reviewed on Youtube.\n\n\nJust Mobile AluPad — $45\nThey clim it's made exclusively for Apple products and there are a couple of positive reviews on Youtube for this one here and there. They say that the surface is pleasant on touch. \n\n\na Better Table\nConsider finding a better table than one that you use now. Just grab your MacBook and mouse and go furniture shop that you like and find a table which fits you the best. You will get biggest possible working surface and as a bonus you can improve  ergonomics of your workplace. And of course keep your table clean (I know it's hard. I have a cat:).\n\nA: \ncloth-covered mousepad (has some issue with correctly tracking)\n\nYou'll need a mousepad with a printed pattern on it, or a very coarse thread count.  The Magic Mouse was designed foremost with low power consumption in mind, and not for twitch gaming.  It sometimes can't see the individual threads on some cloth mousepads well enough to track.  A busy printed pattern will be better than a large two color company logo.\nYou can buy almost any of the printed mousepads at the Apple store and get good results.\nIf the feel was ok, and tracking was the only issue, I suggest simply swapping the mousepad out for one with a printed pattern.\nYou can also test this out without buying a new one by wrapping your old mousepad in some old clothing or tshirt of yours and testing it.  If that fixes the problem, get a new mousepad, or glue a square of shirt material to the top of your existing mousepad.\n\nA: Put Scotch tape on the bottom of your Magic Mouse (as recommended by @Will) and use a binder cover as your \"mousepad\".\nI had a spare 3-ring binder and simply cut off the cover with scissors, then used some more tape to keep it from sliding around my desk.\nIt sounds hack, but it's cheap, and works really well! Much less friction, but still accurate and precise.\n\n\n\nA: Many thanks for all the suggestions above! I've tried many of these (and others) but eventually my solution to this (surprising but irritating) problem is a simple A4 clear plastic paper wallet or folder - the type which have an opening on one long and one short side but with no fasteners or closing poppers - the wallets usually have a very slightly textured surface (these seem to work better than a totally smooth surface). Put a single sheet of paper inside - colour of your choice to match your mood or decor (I use white as I have a white desk) - and finally use some clear tape to fix to the desk (landscape or portrait) and hey presto - almost silent, smooth and accurate Magic Mouse gliding!     \n\nA: I use a cloth covered mousepad with a printed pattern.  Seems to work just fine.  Also seems to work on a very clean (non-sticky) non-wood office desk surface.  \nRubbing just a bit of skin oil from your fingers onto the plastic bars on the bottom of the mouse may or may not help your feel for the sliding.\n\nA: I had the same problem with a cloth mousemat, but found the cover of a glossy magazine to work really well.  It glides nicely with no scratching sounds, and it tracks perfectly.  So now, for aesthetic reasons, I used a blank sheet of glossy laser printer paper.  Presumably you could print something to have a custom design or colour, but I have not tried that myself.\n\nA: I find that a laminated piece of paper works quite well for me as a Magic Mouse surface.\n\nA: The suggestions on using a glossy magazine cover made me thing about glossy paper for printing photographs. Works great!\n\nA: I use a neat little product called Fliders.  They are tiny pads that attach to the bottom of your mouse and actually replace a mousepad.  They are made from a soft material that reduces the noise and makes moving the mouse smoother on the desk.\n\nA: I have an iMac with a wireless mouse. After a couple years - it stopped working on my desk. I cleaned both the mac and desk - still no luck. Then I grabbed a glossy white loose leaf binder - and used it as a mouse pad. It works fine. Go figure. Matt white does not do it - glossy white does. I am guessing something is clogging the mouse eye. \n\nA: I am a programmer and the lack of easy glide with the magic mouse has been quite a problem. I've always had super-light touch mice/mouse-pads on Mac and Windows and it minimizes the effort used to move the mouse which is very desirable.\nApple understands the value of this minimum effort goal as evidenced by their keyboard. The keys are very easy to depress and travel a very small distance.\nBut the mouse was a real problem.\nI have tried every surface imaginable short of buying an expensive piece of sheet metal which I was very skeptical of.\nI did eventually buy the fliders and found them satisfactory. I use them on the smooth surface of my wood desk. But there is still undesirable friction. I had resigned myself to it.\nThen today I decide to check if there were any new ideas online. I found this discussion and was intrigued by the idea of what was referred to above as \"selotape\". \nCould it be that simple ?\nI placed a strip of 3M Scotch tape (the matte surface variety that you can write on) over each flider on the mouse. To my amazement it is a perfect solution. The magic mouse glides as perfectly as all my others. Incredible. So simple.\nI am not sure if it would be just as good without the fliders. My guess is yes. But for now it feels so good I'm leaving the fliders under the tape. They do add a tiny bit of softness to the feel.\n\nA: I fixed mine by using the aluminum side of my old ipad that is too slow to use for much anymore, makes a great mouse pad though, works great now.  \n\nA: Basketball shorts work perfect for me\n\nA: I have found an aluminium gaming pad to be cold, scratchy & not good - not that responsive or accurate. I had a really old, freebie branded mouse pad & that worked well. Magazines, tables, books etc all not good. Think the mouse pads you used to get given 10 years ago & you will be on the right track, with the foam under & the slightly hard & slightly shiny surface. \n\nA: Use any pad/mat but change the tracking on the mouse via System Preferences > Mouse settings to suit the pad. If it's slow across page move tracking over to fast.\n\nA: I use a placemat designed for putting your plate on at dinner. This works perfectly with magic mouse. The placemat has a hard surface on top that is very smooth and lets the two rubber/plastic strips on the underside of the mouse glide around with just the right amount of friction. It also has a cork backing that grips the table. It's the perfect (and cheap!) solution, plus you can shop around for different designs. Only drawback is that you may need to buy a set of 4.\n\nA: I am going to throw my recommendation in here because I recently started using a mouse pad that works really well\n3M Precise Mouse Pad with Non-Skid Backing and Battery Saving Design-Bitmap - $5\n\nI originally bought this because I needed a cheap mouse pad without kittens, puppies, or dolphins on it that I could throw in my briefcase  so I could use my mouse (Apple Magic Mouse and Microsoft Arc Mouse) when I was out and about.  Sometimes the work surface (like a picnic table) is impractical to use a mouse on.\nThis thing actually works as advertised for only $5  The tracking is excellent, but I was curious to see how well it extended my battery life.  I have a rechargeable battery that only holds a week's worth of charge (needs to be replaced).  When I put this pad in place, I got just over a week and a half with the same battery.\nFor the price, you can't beat this mouse pad.\n\nA: I use a standard mouse mat, fabric backed with rubber to prevent movement. £5 from the local stationery store.\nPerformance is much better than on the old, somewhat shiny mouse mat that I was replacing. I would see really odd Magic Mouse behaviour such as missed clicks and extra scrolling in certain apps.\n\nA: My magic mouse started being scratchy and it was driving me crazy. After trying some of the suggestions above, and going out and getting a gamers mouse-pad, I still wasn't happy. My solution was purchasing a plastic sign that had one side that is white with no printing. I cut it to size, put an even layer of double back tape on the print size and stuck it to my desk. Initially, the plastic was too shiny and the mouse didn't work right, so I used some 3-M sanding material, very fine material, and knocked the gloss off and it works perfectly! Low cost, custom size/shape, and no more scratchy mouse sounds.\n\nA: The glossy dust cover of the Chicago Manual of Style (15th edition) seems to work quite well.\n\nA: The perfect surface is simly a sheet of printer white paper laid on top of your \nregular mouse pad 1/8\" thick rubber pad . FAST and ZERO effort !\n", "Q: iOS 5 Upgrade: Massive Battery Drain and Crashing Phone App I upgraded to iOS 5 a few days ago. Although the installtion was a bit bumpy, everything completed successfully. However, since the upgrade, the following symptoms have occurred:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phone battery life dropped dramatically. Locked handset warms up while the battery life drops by 30% per hour.\n\n*The Phone app closes as soon as it's opened. Calls can still be made via Contacts, but hanging up or using keypad tones is virtually impossible.\n\n\nActions Taken So Far:\n1. Deactivated every location service, syncronisation, ping setting, and push notification I can find. No difference.\n2. Deleted my iCloud account. No difference.\n3. performed two complete restores. No difference.\n3. Switched off Mobile Data. Success: battery life and Phone app restored! Although renders the 'smartphone' pretty useless.\nQuestion:\nDoes anyone else have this combination of problems since upgrade, or have any suggestions to help me. I'm visiting the Apple Store at the weekend and will look forward to being reminded that my warranty is 6 days out of date.\n\nA: Turn off Wi-Fi Sync.\nI did it and voilá!\nIt seems that iPhone is constantly looking for an iTunes and tries to connect to it permanently. In fact If I had WI-FI Sync on, iPhone would appear on iTunes for a couple of seconds and then disappear.\nTo turn it off just plug your iPhone to your computer, open iTunes, click on your iPhone on the left bar and uncheck Wi-Fi Sync.\nGood luck! \n\nA: I have updated to iOS 5 & have unusual battery drain problem. After trying many setting my impression is - the cellular data transfer may be the culprit. Things improve a lot when turn it off. \n\nA: Further to the problems I raised in my original question, I may have stumbled on a fix. After another unsuccessful full restore, I decided to run a final Erase All Content and Settings. However, this time I decided not to restore the phone but instead activate it as a new user. After completing the setup, the phone did a lot of internal processing then launched perfectly as a new handset. This confirmed to me that something about my original profile was causing the problems. So, I then restored the phone to my original profile to discover it working perfectly still! I've slowly reactivated all my data settings and as yet, no problems.\nI'm left wondering if the core Operating System is quite heavily partitioned from much of the other utilities and applications in the user's profile. Perhaps a corruption in my downloaded iOS 5 could not be resolved by restoring my profile in and out, but instead resolved by the process of creating a new user. Then when my original profile was restored against the repaired operating system, everything worked fine.\nAnyway, so far so good.\n\nA: I have used Clean Install on my 3GS and problem is solved. Clean Install in this case means that I didn't restore backup settings after updating to iOS 5 but reconfigured everything from scratch.\n", "Q: How to unlock an iPhone 3GS with 05.16.05? I had a perfectly working unlocked and jailbroken iPhone 3GS, but of course I had to go ahead and try to get iOS 5 on it. I didn't know I need to preserve my baseband while updating it, so now ultrasn0w will not unlock it for me and I'm left without a phone line.\nIs there any way to unlock an iPhone 3GS with 05.16.05 baseband? If not, is there any expected change that will allow me to do so?\n\nA: Ran into this by accident, but if you are still having issues there is now an iOS 5 jailbreak out - although tethered, it will do what you want.\n\nA: By now it is possible to down-grade your baseband - at least for the iPhone 3G and 3GS (unfortunately not 4/S) - from the iPad's 06.15 to 05.13.04 (un-lockable) thanks to the great work of the iPhone Dev Team:\n\nThe iPhone Dev Team is happy to announce a baseband downgrade option in redsn0w for those who are using the iPad’s 06.15 baseband on the iPhone3G or iPhone3GS.\nTypically you’d have the 06.15 baseband if you unlock with ultrasn0w but updated your iPhone baseband past 05.13.04.  With this new capability, you can now downgrade specifically from 06.15 to 05.13.04 (even if you never had 05.13.04 on that device before).  This gives you the best of both worlds: ultrasn0w compatibility and a normal iPhone baseband with full GPS and the ability to use stock IPSWs again.\n\nSee this post on their blog.\n", "Q: Buying iPhone 4S under another family member's name I would like to buy an iPhone 4S under a different family member's name as their eligibility to purchase the phone is available and furthermore, they're on a different bill. \nIf I purchase the 4S under my family member's name and activate it under my name... will the \"required\" text messaging plan, etc. still hold on the purchaser's bill even though the iPhone was not activated under that name? \nNote:  This isn't to unlock the phone to use it on a different network -- it would remain on AT&T.\n\nA: Yes - not only is this allowed, Apple and AT&T have systems in place to effect this purchase. Note - this is only for plans where you are billed together. If you can get on the same plan, just ask them about using a cross upgrade so that you can burn the upgrade eligibility of a different number on your family plan to get a new phone for a line that currently isn't eligible for upgrade pricing.\nIn your case, where you are not billed together it gets messy. If they don't buy the phone off contract - then the carrier could hold them to pay for the data plan if the contract has that provision. This situation is analagous to them buying a new phone and then selling it on the open market. I haven't heard of AT&T cracking down on this, but you could easily see how they intend the subsidy to generate 2 years of revenue from the buyer.\nAs you are not eligible for an upgrade, it goes to sense that you haven't yet paid off your last \"loan\". Have you asked how much it would cost for you to end your contract? Unless you also are on a family plan, you might shop around and then go to AT&T and not threaten to leave, but explain your budget and your options and ask them how long you have to wait or how much you might need to pay to get back to a more budget friendly place for you to upgrade your handset. I've seen times when they'll budge a few months, but keep in mind if you haven't honored your last contract with them, you've got to be reasonable when asking for further accomodations.\n\nA: Depending on whether or not you are under the same \"Family Plan\" as your relative, you can use a cross upgrade and still have the same plan you currently have. At the Apple store the only information the specialist will need is the account holders social security # and if there is a password on the account. This is a very common question Apple employees get, and it's very easy to execute. \nNow, if you are not on the same \"Family Plan\" you will need the account holder there with you to upgrade the device with you. \n", "Q: Built-in WebDAV client able to connect via HTTPS with client certificate?

I really like the reminders feature in iOS 5, especially the geo-tripping reminders that will alert you when you are at, or leave, specific locations. \nI was disappointed, however, that you could not have 'shared reminders list'. For instance a shopping list that my wife and I could both use and contribute to that would alert us whenever we are at the grocery store.\nIs there any method or workaround to accomplish this? OR is there an application that does this geo-tripping + the ability to share across multiple users?\n\nA: Since Brant Bobby posted his answer (which was great) the iCloud.com site has changed and you can no longer create shared Reminders lists, but this is expected to return in OS X 10.8.2 & iOS 6.\nIt looks like as of 2012-10-15 the ability to share Reminders has been added back to the iCloud web app.\n\nA: Actually, you can share a reminders list, as long as the person you want to share with has their own iCloud account. You can share one of your reminders lists either from iCloud.com or from the Reminders app in Mountain Lion.\nEither way, the process is the same: Hover over the name of a list for a second, and a small icon will appear. Click on it, then type in the name or e-mail address of the person you want to share the list with.\n\n\n", "Q: What do the Photo Stream settings in Aperture do? I understand that the iOS 5 Photo Stream is a collection of all of the recent photos taken on all iOS 5 devices in a given account, synced with those devices through the cloud. It is not clear to me, however, what the Photo Stream settings in Aperture do.\n\nIt appears that \"Enable Photo Stream\" simply connects Aperture to the Photo Stream and makes it available as a source for viewing and importing into Aperture; but it is not clear to me what \"Automatic Import\" and \"Automatic Upload\" do.\n\nA: *\n\n*Automatic Import: Imports any pictures received via Photo Stream into the main Aperture library. A copy will be created for this which remains even after the 1000th picture has been added to the stream and which can be edited\nFor this to work Aperture has to be open/running. If the 1000 picture threshold is reached while Aperture is not running, pictures will get lost irregardless of the setting of this option.\n\n\n*Automatic Upload: Push any picture created in Aperture into the Photo Stream and on to all other connected devices\n\nA: Automatic Upload:\nSends any photo added into your Aperture catalog into your overall Photo Stream.\nAutomatic Import:\nWhen new photos are added into your overall Photo Stream Aperture will import them into your catalog and if there's facial recognition or geolocation information use that to filter and organize. \nI will admit I've not tried it, but everything I've read about it says that's what it does.\n", "Q: A good (and inexpensive) images manager for Mac? I'm dealing with a huge variety of image files (photos, vectors, icons, cliparts, etc.).\nI've organized them in folders and subfolders, in order to find theproper sort of image, but I don't find a good way to quickly get what I need.\nI've tried following solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhoto\n\n*Picasa\n\n*Adobe Bridges\n\n*ACDSee\n\n\nAll of them have some kind of issue that I will resume here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unable to show all sort of iles (e.g.: if ti shows pictures, it doesn't show vector images, like .ai files)\n\n*Unable to handle a library (only browsing through the filesystem)\n\n*Unable to retrieve metadata (and therefore take advantage of an hypothetical search engine)\n\n*Unable to handle separated libraries (iPhoto and Picasa creates a single library, mixed with all images: personal and for work can't be spearated, unless using tags or folders)\n\n*Unable to display a single stream images (filtered or not filtered): they only shows the current folder/album files\n\n\nI know that probably Lightroom and other (expensive) products would solve my problem, but they are meant for more than that. Instead, I just want to find a media library that only makes my life easier when looking for an image.\nI've found a couple of questions here in that makes similar questions, but none of them really matches my needs (and anyway, the answer's always iPhoto, Picasa or some adobe products).\nBy the way, I've tried with Adobe Bridges because I have a free Adobe Elements license (so, no Lightroom).\n\nA: Well, you could try some sort of \"anything bucket\" like DevonThink or Yojimbo, as those should be pretty capable of handling the search and metadata parts, but I think those might be tad bit overkill if you only want to use it for images.\nI am not sure how powerful the image managing part is, as I mostly use the conversion and editing tools, but GraphicConverter has some image managing parts built into it and might be worth a try:\nhttp://www.lemkesoft.com/content/188/graphicconverter.html\nAs I said, it mostly is a conversion and light editing tool, but since it is an old-school shareware program, you can try it out for free to see if it suits your taste. In that case, I would recommend trying out both version 6 and 7, as 7 was a complete rewrite and as far as I know has not yet full feature parity with the older version.\n", "Q: Map gestures to mouse buttons I do like the mac mouse. touch sensitivity is nice. But the precision and number of buttons on my gaming mouse is much better. It seems to work on the mac just fine, but only left/right click and scroll works. \nIs there a way to map swipe gestures to different buttons on the mouse? For exampe if have a main button on either side of the mouse, that when on my pc work as back/forward in a browser. I also have a button mapped to a script that brings up a code editor. Windows+Left/Right go to the previous/next workspace (I primarily use linux actually). So I would like to be able to do similar things on the mac, but a gogole search only brought up mapping gestures to keyboard commands, not the mouse.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool (free)\n\nI don't have a multi-button mouse to test with, but it should support mapping gestures to arbitrary buttons.\n", "Q: Painfully slow to browse large list of subfolders via SMB and/or AFP Having an issue where I have a folder on a QNAP NAS with over 68,000 subfolders within it.\nI can browse it quickly and almost instantaneously within Windows 7 via SMB, however in OSX 10.6.8 and 10.7.2, it takes nearly 10+ minutes to display the subfolders, using both SMB and AFP.\nHoping there is an easy solution - we can't break the folders into smaller subfolders due to a requirement of proprietary software that accesses the sub folders.\nI've tried the fixes suggested here, which don't seem to help: http://www.macwindows.com/snowleopard-filesharing.html#030311b\nHave the same issue browsing the files on a Windows 2003 server, so it is not a NAS issue - rather, it's an issue with how OS X browses over the network.  Perhaps it is trying to cache all the files/folders before displaying them? \nWindows 7 doesn't do this, and therefore the subfolders display almost immediately.\n\nA: I, too, find this a pain with my QNAP box. FYI the firmware has now been updated to 3.6.0 released just a few days ago, and there is some noticeable improvement with the update. However, you may consider using the iSCSI feature among the QNAP settings to make the file shares appear as a hard drive showing up on your desktop for better speed. I've noticed iSCSI works better IMO if your connection to the QNAP is hardwired throughout and not wireless in any way; wireless iSCSI works, just not as fast in my experience.\n\nA: try to relaunch your finder, some of my colleagues got improve after this.\nif in same lan, some computer fast and some slow.\n", "Q: How can I delete contact relationships in Siri? Today something really stupid happened to me. To show the new iPhone I gave it to a friend at work. He activated Siri and said:\n\"Call my father\"\nSiri said : \"Who is your father?\"\nMy friend said his name and since he was in the address book contacts the phone called his number. Now every time I say \"Call my father\" my friends number is called. How can I delete this \"relationship\" and where is it stored?\n\nA: Tell Siri \"My father is XYZ\" and let it make the change for you.\n\nA: According to this Apple discussion forum, the way to modify the contact is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings->General->Siri\n\n*Tap 'My Info' \n\n*Change the wrong profile to the correct contact\n\n\nAlternately, you can also follow the instructions from this post:\n\nSet up a contact for yourself and edit it to add a field\n  \"relationship\" or something like that. Then you can add mother,\n  brother, etc. Next time you tell siri to \"send text to your mom it\n  will know.\n\nOther useful Siri tips can be found here.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure your \"My Info\" setting in Siri is correctly set to your contact.\n\n*Find your own contact info and click Edit.\n\n*scroll down till you see the \"father\" field.\n\n*Click the red delete button next to the father field or change it your fathers contact.\n\n\n(evidently i'm not cool enough for images yet, sorry)\n\nA: Go to your own name in you 'contacts' and your Siri created relationships are all there.

It seems that LaunchPad is not remembering the position of my app icons. I manually sorted them by name, but every now and then it will shuffle them. \nI have not yet identified the pattern that resets the icons (my best guess is that it is after every restart). I have also not identified the pattern on which it resets the icons themselves, but it seems to leave Apple's own apps grouped together, followed by my Mac App Store purchases at the bottom. \nIs anybody else experiencing this behavior and is there a way to keep all icons sorted by name? Thanks.\n\nA: This is a known bug and has been filed with Apple. All we can do is wait on a fix. \nThe database gets corrupted when a new entry is added and moved. \nThe only current workaround is to delete the database and start over, but bear in mind that once a new item is added and moved to a different position, the corruption will occur again. \nThe database is located in ~/Library/Application Support/Dock\n", "Q: How can you disable the low battery warnings for bluetooth devices? I use a bluetooth apple trackpad and keyboard, and once the battery hits 20% the bluetooth indicator in the menu bar starts flashing this lower battery warning. Normally, I wouldn't really care, but 20% battery is about 1-2 months of usage so the thing just flashes at me constantly for over a month.\nIs there a way to disable this behavior?\n\nA: I don't mind the alert or warning, but I do mind the weeks of having a blinking icon in my Menubar.  Here's what I did in Terminal:\n$ cd /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/Bluetooth.menu/Contents/Resources/\n$ sudo cp lowbatt.pdf lowbatt.backup.pdf\n$ sudo cp BlueTooth_Connected.pdf lowbatt.pdf\n\nThis replaces the low battery icon with the same connected icon.  I assume the icon is still \"blinking\" in that it's switching one for the other, but since they're now the same, you don't notice.\nNow I get the 20%, 10%, 5% alerts, but no annoying blink.\nThis is in Lion.  It's likely that system updates and perhaps even Mountain Lion will undo this, but it can probably be reapplied after updates are performed.\n\nFor Mountain Lion, the relevant files are named:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth_Low_Battery.pdf\n\n*Bluetooth_Connected.pdf\n\nA: Here's a workaround posted on Macworld. You'll need to rename the /System/Library/CoreServices/MenuExtras/Bluetooth.menu file.

Where is Siri (on iOS5 on an iPhone 4S) get it's list of recognized locations, such as those used for location-based reminders, from? \n\nI've seen demonstrations and have experimented a bit, but only a very few locations like \"home\" seem to work well. Is it necessary to set up named locations in Contacts? Does Siri use \"world knowledge\" from other sources (such as Maps or Yelp)? Is there a way for users to extend or configure the list of locations Siri recognizes, or for developers to create applications that do so?\n\nA: The Reminders application does something similar, it knows three locations: Home, Work, and Other. When you assign a location to a reminder, you are presented with the current location, those 3 previously mentioned locations, and a \"Choose Address\" option. The 3 locations are taken from the address book's contact information for yourself. The contact that represents yourself is determined by the setting under Settings > Safari > AutoFill > My Info.\nI'm guessing that Siri uses the same My Info setting to determine locations such as Home.\nNote that the name of a contact has no effect on the Reminders app. Even if you have a contact named \"Home\" it will not present this as a default address unless the contact is also assigned to the My Info setting.\nUpdate: Siri has its own My Info setting which is the exact same one accessed in Safari (i.e. they always have the same value).\n\nA: AFAIK, you have to first define the location (ie. \"1234 main street is my home\").  \nIf you ask Siri \"Remind me to buy milk at Safeway\", it will prompt you, \"When would you like me to remind you?\"\nI suspect (hope?) this behavior will change as Siri becomes more advanced.\n", "Q: Which iOS and Lion third-party apps support \"Documents in the Cloud\"? Which apps in iOS and Lion support the \"Documents in the Cloud\" feature from iCloud? I know that Apple's own iWork apps support this. But other than Apple's own apps, which third-party apps implement this?\nIt would be helpful to know the name of the app as well as how it uses \"Documents in the Cloud\".

She has to switch to speaker mode during calls.  \nTo fix this, she plugs in the headphone and unplugs it.  Not a bad workaround IMO, but very annoying to her.  She's debating selling it on ebay and getting a different phone.\nI'm not sure if this is hardware or software related.  Any advice?  Upgrade the software?  Not sure if it will fix it, but we probably will anyway.\n\nA: This can happen when the contact spring inside the headset jack is loose, cracked or broken, or maybe the plug or jack is just dirty and shorted out.  Perhaps try cleaning/degreasing the plug and then blowing out the jack with compressed air.  If that doesn't work, a visit to the Apple store is in order.\nThis same problem can happen on different models of other phones as well, any phone that has a headset jack.\n", "Q: Which applications should be in the Utilities folder?

As they do, my battery was noticeably depleting as well as conflicted with the device having been slightly water damaged (dropped in quickly but immediately turned off and dried out. Works \"fine\"). I decided to replace the internal battery with a factory OEM version but even after doing so my battery life is awful. I am talking about losing 10% during one 4 minute phone call or 30% in the first hour or less or simple standby. \nAre there things I should look for or perhaps additional parts which could be causing the depletion? \nFor reference: I charged the phone to 100%, turned the phone off, then 3 days later (with phone off) the battery was completely dead. Something else seems to be constantly running or draining the battery.\n\nA: It is a common issue for an iPhone to have premature battery life draining, I can't speak to the self replacement, but generally the fastest and best course of action is to follow the steps for syncing your information to a personal information management software(address book, ical, etc) and restoring the device as new.\nThe step by step instructions are listed in: \n How to back up your data and set up as a new device\nAgain just to reiterate, you do not want to restore from a backup in iTunes, but restore the device into a factory default state. If it isn't fixed by that, it's likely a permanent hardware problem.\n\nA: There´s a lot to do when problem is battery not lasting, mostly it´s user´s fault. 5 hints that may double your battery:\n\n\n*\n\n*close all unused app - You hit home, but app is still running! use an app to free mem and close them up, or close 1 by 1, in multitasking bar;\n\n*set you brightness lower, and smaller time on autolock - Screen leds are one of the items that uses more bat power. with low brightness, lower power consumption;\n\n*only activate 3g when you´re really using it! The same with WiFi, Bluetooth Etc. Using SBSettings makes it even easier (cydia tweak);\n\n*why location turned on 24/7? let it on only when you want to use it!\n\n*full cycle bat once a month - let it drain almost completely, and charge it for at least 8 hours with all apps closed;\n\n*less notifications, or shut it off - notifications also uses a lot of resources, as run in background most of time.\nmy iphone4 lasts up to 4 days, so I assure it really makes difference!\n\nA: Here are a few tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Off Keyboard Clicks Sound\n\n*Disable Background App Refresh\n\n*Turn off the Parallax Effect/Animations\n\n*Turn off Wifi/Bluetooth/Airdrop\n\n*Disable Location Services\n\n*Close Running Apps in the Background\n\n*Remove the App Garbage Files by CleanMyPhone\n\n\nSource: http://www.fireebok.com/resource/how-to-improve-battery-life-on-your-iphone.html\n", "Q: Why won't my iPhone 4 play through my bose sound dock anymore? It used to work, but now it doesn't. It now has iOS 5 on it. (I can't say for sure once iOS 5 went on it stopped working)\nWhen I plug it into the docking station I hear the audio click, the green power light goes on the bose for a second, then it goes off then the phone charges.\nIf I go into Music and play anything, it appears as though it's playing though there is no sound coming from the sound-dock.\nI can connect wirelessly to my Apple TV and it works, though then when playing on the TV, I connected it to the sound-dock and was able to select the \"docking station\" option (instead of Apple TV)\nI've tried the phone on a cheap branded docking station and it works fine.\nI've tried an iPod Touch in the sound-dock and it plays music fine.\nI've restored the iPhone in case it was some glitch.\nBut still the problem persists. It charges, and appears to play, but no sound...\nIts a SoundDock Series II, and both it and the phone have been powered off/reset to no avail.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This is a software issue that Apple have not sorted out. I have an iPhone 4S and was prompted to update software on my phone. Since updating I have lost several important functions including the ability to dock the phone in my Bose speakers. Despite Apple support's advice to reinstall the phone, these issues remain.\n\nA: There is probably pocket lint, dust, sweat (and God knows what else) caked up in the port. Take a toothpick and gently scrape all that bad stuff out. If this won't do the trick then off to Apple you go.\n\nA: I'm not really familiar with that system but I do know that sometimes pins that connect to the iPhone or iPod may be damaged with regular use. In which I hope that's not the case. Also like \"skipthepip\" said, lit and dust could be the problem.\nYou might also have an issue with the Bose firmware. Since I'm not knowledgeable of the sound system I can't be sure if it has any firmware at all. My best guess is to ask Bose on getting it fixed.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I went to the apple store, they said it was some pins pushed back, making the iPhone think it was connected to a TV.  They couldn't fix it so it was replaced with a new iPhone 4 ($150.00 out of warranty), but it still did not work. I think it's a software issue.\n\nA: It must be a software issue.  Ever since I upgraded the software it doesn't work, however, when I plug in another phone that has not yet been updated there is no problem.\n\nA: iPhone 4 would not play music through the Bose dock so I used a 3.5mm stereo jack \"from headphone\" lead that plugged into the back of dock with a 3.5mm jack and bingo, I had sound through the Bose dock.\n\nA: I have multiple docs, chargers and headphones, and the problem that i see is PURELY intermittent.   NEVER happened until i updated to ios 7.04, and no .06.   The volume bar on siriusxm and youtube videos appears, and disappears, and if i'm lucky, it'll play after disconnecting from an alarm clock charger or power cable.   It MUST be software, it's all been cleaned and settings reset, also.\n\nA: It is a software problem. There are multiple threads regarding this issue based on the IOS update and it is happening on other docks not just Bose. So I would think it would be one hell of a coincidence that everyone's docks need to be cleaned or all have inop pins at the same time. I've also heard on another thread that Apple has been told of the problem but don't seem to care since they don't sell bose products anymore.                       \nMy iPhone 4 no longer works on my bose or my alarm clock docks the way it used to since I updated. It's obviously not a hardware issue. I read on another forum that buying a scosche adapter will allow it to work on your dock again.

As soon as I unplug the connection to the external monitor, my wireless is restored to full power and I can connect to websites like this one.\nIs there anything I can do to troubleshoot this very annoying problem? \nHere's what happens when I switch from single monitor to dual while pinging 8.8.4.4:\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=14 ttl=56 time=30.070 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=15 ttl=56 time=30.886 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=16 ttl=56 time=31.343 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=17 ttl=56 time=31.772 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=18 ttl=56 time=30.662 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=19 ttl=56 time=162.196 ms\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 20\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=20 ttl=56 time=1071.753 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=21 ttl=56 time=417.013 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=22 ttl=56 time=478.626 ms\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 24\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=25 ttl=56 time=367.057 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=26 ttl=56 time=443.585 ms\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 27\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 28\n64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=29 ttl=56 time=365.072 ms\n\nAs you can see, soon as I switch to dual monitors, the return time drastically increases, sometimes timing out completely.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Looks like I accidentally stumbled across a solution: if I move my laptop an extra 30cms away from the monitor, the internet connection doesn't trickly away to nothing.\nIt's probably some kind of interference that is causing the problem, and it seems that keeping some distance between the monitor and the laptop is enough to resolve the issue.\n\nA: Switch your wireless access point to a different channel! \nI had the exact same problem on a mid-2012 MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion. The Apple cable would give me errors on the external monitor, so I bought a 3rd party one that worked perfectly but killed my Wi-Fi connection. Switching the Wi-Fi channel from Auto to Channel 10 somehow solved this issue—works perfectly now! (Didn't figure this out myself, someone suggested it on some forum, but I don't remember who and where.)\n\nA: My 15\" Macbook Pro Unibody used to drop all WiFi connections immediately when connected to my external monitor. I was ridiculous, I would have to disconnect my external monitor any time I needed to access the web. Fortunately, I found a solution. \nAnswer: Use an Apple-brand Mini-display-port to DVI adapter instead of a RocketFish brand adapter. Now I have wifi AND my external monitor, all at the same time. \n\nA: I have a similar problem. When I take my MacBook to the 1st floor of my house, the connection becomes very unreliable, extremely slow. If I try to disconnect and reconnect it fails to reconnect to the access point. The access point is placed in the basement, so the signal has to travel through 2 floors. Just as you, the wireless strength indicator indicates that I have a strong signal.\nThis used to work perfectly fine. But I can however see that there are now a lot more wireless networks (+10) than there used to be. So I assume that the problem is caused by interference from from my neighbors' wireless connection.\nSo perhaps if you can place the access point closer to your work desk, it could solve the problem.\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue with MBP Retina 13 and Dell 2408 DVI2mini-display and what helped here was to pull out the dvi-cable completely (as i tried to move away as far as possible from the monitor and then moved closer.) At the end I was 30-40cm away but with straight cable and now WiFi still works.\n\nA: Solution is: use original apple mini display port to DVI (or other) adapter to avoid losing wifi connection with macbook pro. (But this was not a problem before, so it seems to be some kind of software issue) Mars 30. 2013.\n\nA: I have had the same issue with my mac and an external monitor regarding wifi speed is slow when on the internet.

If I purchase Lion now, will I get a refund after entering update code into iTunes?\n\nA: Probably not, but you should contact Apple in your country to get a definitive answer.\n\nA: I got confirmation of refund from apple and it seems that this is possible to do if you explain your situation well enough.\n", "Q: Can't remove U.S. from the languages and input methods menu I wonder if I can remove the U.S. language of the languages list.\nBecause I use a shortcut to cycle through input methods, and don't want to land on U.S. as ArgenPinYin is already a modified U.S. international keyboard layout, so I don't need the plain U.S.\nIs there a way?\n\n\nA: It appears that OS X requires a keyboard layout that it recognizes as producing latin characters to be selected as one of the choices in the menu, and it does not recognize ArgenPinYin as one of them. I can deselect the US layout if I select German or Portuguese, for instance, but not if I select Greek or Pinyin - Simplified.\nSo yes, U.S. can be removed as a language, but some other keyboard layout that OS X recognizes as a Latin layout must first be selected.\n\nA: OS X might recognize a custom layout as equivalent to one of the Roman system layouts if you could somehow include it in the AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle in system/library/keyboard layouts, but I have never seen any way to modify that.\n", "Q: Correct syntax for bash grep function?

Under 10.5.8, the user is complaining about some 'slowing down' (especially after a few days w/o restarting).  If we upgrade, how strongly is it recommended to increase the RAM (to 4GB? to 6GB?).\nI'd love to hear from people answering based on either the specs or first-hand experience.  Thanks.\n\nA: I have a late 2008 MacBook Pro 5,1 2GbRam 2.4GHz When I updated to Lion, I had no major problems. I had always planned to upgrade my Ram so after one month I did 8GB When Apple said my MBP can only take 4GB. 8Gb of RAM cost $40 on Amazon, best investment I made this year.\n\nA: I had a white MacBook (early 2008), 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB HD. I upgraded it to Lion and it worked, although it was a little slow.\nThen I bought 4 GB of RAM and it ran without problems (not blazing fast... but absolutely OK). I strongly advise that you upgrade the RAM to at least 4 GB: if you don't, the system will be frequently swapping.\n", "Q: Why won't Subversion remember certificates? I'm using Terminal and committing some data to a remote SVN server... every time I get the same message about a new certificate, and I choose to \"permanently\" accept the cert and it works.

Did it work at one point in the past, or has it always been a problem?\nMost likely the issue is somewhere inside of ~/.subversion/auth/. You could try blowing away the directory, though that will require you to recreate all your credentials. (Maybe something in there is borking up authentication process.)\nI suggest you try to recreate your problem with another user profile, computer, or operating system, and compare ~/.subversion directories with your broken system.\nIf you are convinced its the Terminal's fault, you can try iTerm2, though I expect the same results in the same environment. Good luck!\n\nA: I've had the same issue, all files in ~/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server/ were set to read-only.\nRunning chmod u+w ~/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server/* fixed it.\n", "Q: Notational velocity on the Mac, notes.app in iOS With the introduction of the iPhone 4S and Siri I really want to stick with notes.app on the iPhone. However I greatly prefer notational velocity on my Mac to using mail.app. \nOther recommendations I've seen thus far has suggested using notational velocity on the Mac in conjunction with a third-party application for ios such a simple note or plaintext. Because of the native notes apps system level integration with the iPhone 4S and Siri I want to stick with notes.app on my iPhone while still syncing back to my computer and being able to use notational velocity\nAnybody know of a way to do this? If not, let's try and come up with one as I imagine it would be useful for many people with the new iPhone 4S.\nUPDATE: I bit the bullet and started using Mail.app for notes on my computer. It sucks, but is worth the price to be able to quickly add to and create new notes using Siri. Hopefully some solution to this will come along.\n\nA: I use Notational Velocity and Simplenote apps on iPhone and iPad and the Simplenote web site as well and while I see you want to stick with Apple's notes.app I think you'll find Simplenote excellent, maybe better. I've been using it as long as it's been out and it's stable, simple, and has always worked for me.\nIf Apple mated the Notes app with something on the Mac I might never have tried Simplenote but it's cumbersome as you say to have to use Mail to deal with notes. Notational Velocity's integration with Simplenote is probably what you're looking for.\nSimplenote is free, give it a go.\n", "Q: What is the right way to maintain Time Machine backup history for a HDD with two partitions? I have two user partitions (not counting any hidden/system ones like Lion Restore etc.) on my MacBook Pro's internal HDD: Volume_A (100 GB) and Volume_B (20 GB). My Time Capsule has been keeping everything backed up nicely for a little over a year now.\nI now want to re-partition my volumes (no change in names). Volume_A: 100 -> 70 GB and Volume_B: 20 -> 50 GB.\nSince I also have access to a CCC backup of both partitions, I can easily delete Volume_B, recreate it with the new, increased size and restore the data into it from the CCC backup.\nMy question is: will Time Machine/Capsule be able to retain the history after the new partition scheme goes live? Or will it decide to wipe the slate clean and start with a fresh backup of the newly re-partitioned setup?\nIs there any way to make sure I don't lose my history and have backups \"continue\" and build upon the existing collection?\n\nA: Okay, so it looks like there is no need to worry about losing backup history on the time-capsule as long as the names of the volumes are unchanged.\nSince there were no answers here, I just bit the bullet and went ahead with what I had originally intended to do. Fortunately, TC picked up the deltas after I resized and restored the data into Volume_B.\nSo now you might be wondering why I even bothered to ask in the first place. Well, the reason I was concerned is because the first time around, when I went from a single partition layout (backed up on TC) to a dual partition layout (with the name of the first partition unchanged), TC had somehow decided that it needed to start from a clean slate, and I lost all the history there.\n", "Q: Create Windows 7 installation disk option I am currently running Lion on my late 2010 Macbook Air. The new bootcamp has an option to create windows 7 installation disk from usb and iso. I have both but bootcamp won't let me select that option, any ideas?\n\n[EDIT]\nFound this from Apple's website\n\nSupport for the Windows 7 ISO installer \n  Install Windows with an installation disc you provide or, on Mac computers that do not have an optical drive, with a USB flash drive that contains a Windows 7 ISO image downloaded from Microsoft. The Boot Camp Assistant will offer to create this image on supported computers.\n\nNo idea what those supported computers are!!\n\nA: I ran into this problem this afternoon. Your Mac's model must be in Boot Camp Assistant's list of supported models for the \"Create a Windows 7 install disk\" option to be available, so you must find out if your model is there and add it if it's not.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Applications > Utilities and right-click on the Boot Camp Assistant app; select Show Package Contents, and open the Contents folder where you should see a file called info.plist.\n**By default you don't have permission to edit info.plist. My preferred way around this is to copy it to my desktop (opt-drag and drop), then rename the original to info_OLD.plist (not necessary to rename it, but if you screw up, at least you'll have the original backed up). Authentification will be required... just enter your password when asked.\n\n*Open the info.plist file on the desktop with Property List Editor (right-click, Open with > Property List Editor).\n\n*At the botton of the window is a list called USBBootSupportedModels. Click on the list and then click the Add Child button on the tool bar. Apparently your model must be the first or last item in the list – this didn't work for me when I accidentally added it to the middle, but it did when it was at the top. If you don't know your model number, click on the Apple menu and click About This Mac, where you should find the information. In Lion I believe you have to click \"System Report\" to get the proper information. My model was MacBook2,1 so the item I added to the top of the list was MB21.\n\n*Save the file when you're done. Now drag it back to the folder where the original file is (replacing the older file if you chose not to rename it).\nWhen you open Boot Camp Assistant now it should give you the option to create an install disk.\n**I haven't completed anything beyond actually getting the option available, so I can't comment on if the install disk will actually be created properly.\n\nA: Not all USB sticks allow you to make them bootable. Try using another one (at least 8GB to be sure) and format them in NFTS or MS-DOS.\nIn which format is your stick formatted?\n", "Q: Diagnosing iMac hard crashes OS X 10.7.x, (updated to 10.7.2 when it became available last week); Quad Core iMac.\nHard crashing about every 2 or 3 weeks, except had one yesterday and another today, 5 times total so far.

Any instrumentation to add?  Tests to run? (Given the time between crashes, I doubt a memory diagnostic is going to find anything.)\n\nA: You could try testing the hard drive with Smart Utility, but it sounds like to me that it is your Ram that you installed. I have personal experience with bad/incompatible ram and the symptoms you are describing are exactly what happens if the ram is the aforementioned. \n", "Q: How to store Mac documents in the iCloud? So, iCloud is now available to all Mac and iOS5 users.\nI don't (yet) have an iOS5 device, but i do have OS X Lion with iCloud installed. I've set it all up nice and (almost) easy. In iCloud PrefsPane I noticed there's an option to sync Documents & Data. This is what baffles me. How do I do that? How can I share Documents & Data between 2 Macs?\nI understand that iOS5 iWork stores all documents in the iCloud, but what about Mac? How do I put files in the iCloud from Mac?\nIf I share a document via Share button in Pages/Numbers it goes to iWork.com, not the iCloud iWork.\n\nA: You cannot treat iCloud as some sort of internet filesystem like Dropbox.  The only way to place data into the iCloud system is via an iCloud enabled app.  There is no generic way to access your iCloud files except via the application that put the files there in the first place.\nSo, in order to use iCloud, use iCloud enabled apps.  Use the same apps on 2 or more Macs, and that is how you share docs/data.\nI'm not sure when the Mac iWork apps will get iCloud, I suspect in the next version which is now sorely overdue.\n\nA: You can share Documents between Macs! I write an article about that! Here it is!\n\nBut this solution supports only Mac-to-Mac!\n\nThe iCloud-Concept is completely different, and it lets you only share Data through Apps. \nBut with this little trick, you can sync documents between Macs!\n\nFor the iPhone, you can use GoodReader for storing documents in\n  the cloud!\n\n", "Q: How do I edit PDF Annotation Text Properties after creation? When I have a form that I don't want to print out and write on, I can simply use Preview.app's PDF Annotations feature in order to fill in the necessary fields, and print out the final result.\nI have now done this and completely filled out a PDF file, but I'm making a few last minute changes and have run into a problem. The first couple of fields have an annotated text size that is nearly double that of the rest of the fields, and I wish to shrink them to be closer, if not exactly the same size.\nBut I am unable to do so;\nIf I click on the text field, as if to resize or move it, then open the Text Properties field and begin changing properties, they do not take effect. If I select text within the text field and again attempt to change properties, they still do not take effect.\nShy of deleting the field and re-typing it with the text properties adjusted prior to doing so, why am I unable to edit text color, size, etc.?\n\nA: It does work in Lion, the way you tried it.  \nIn Snow-Leopard you have to select the text itself to change the font(size) by first clicking/selecting the text-field to get the selection rectangle (for re-sizing or moving - as you described) and then click a second time on your text to select all the characters. Now your text should be selected (visible by the highlighting) and you will be able to change the font-size in the Text Properties field.\n\n\nEdit 2012-01-04:  \nI could reproduce the problem described and also found a simple solution. If you open your pdf and re-arrange pages or rotate them and then try to change the formating of existing text fields it (sometimes) fails.  \nThe solution/fix is to click the window (menu-)bar of the \"Fonts\" window, then click on your text field again and finally chose the new font variant → and it will be applied :D\n\n\nA: To investigate the state of your annotations you could try this Automator workflow:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Finder Items\n\n*Get Selected Finder Items\n\n*Extract PDF Annotations\n\n\nMaybe this gives you a hint why some of the annotations are locked for editing.\n\n", "Q: Which alternatives to Microsoft Excel are there for MacOS X and what are their (dis)advantages? I'm still working with Office:mac:2004 on my MacBook 13\" (2,16 GHz, 3 GB RAM, MacOS X 10.6.8) and it is quite slow in Loading the applications, so I avoid working with it if I can.\nWhat are alternatives to MS Excel which have at least the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*filtering of tables\n\n*creating complex formulae\n(if possible also a programming language like VBA to create custom commands and formulae)\n\n*cell format change automatically dependent on cell value\n\n\n(Free applications would be welcome)\nWould the most recent version of MS Office perform better on my (quite old) MacBook?\n\nA: I would recommend you use Numbers from Apple. It is a very powerful tool, yet very easy to get started with.\nYou find more information about it on the Apple product page: http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/\nHere are some hints for your requested features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filtering of tables http://www.apple.com/iwork/tutorials/#numbers-cell\n\n*Creating complex formulae http://www.apple.com/iwork/tutorials/#numbers-formula\n\n*Formatting cells http://www.apple.com/iwork/tutorials/#numbers-format\nIf you are interested in scripting Numbers, I highly recommend you to check out the AppleScript language guide.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/AppleScriptLanguageGuide.pdf\nNumbers, as many other popular OSX applications, is fully scriptable using AppleScript.\nMy own experience with Numbers is great. I stopped using Excel a long time ago. I use it as my main spreadsheet application, and I found the learning curve is quite shallow. Although if you plan to become an expert user, it may take a while to adapt to the different environment. But as long as you go the \"Apple way\" by learning and using the built in tools, you will soon find yourself in a very comfortable spot.\nA good example is the Address Book. Since I have started using the Address Book, mass mailing became very easy.\n\nA: Before Apple came out with Numbers I used a nice application called Tables which isn't as powerful as Numbers but did the trick nicely in that it played well with my old Excel and AppleWorks files and was/is a clean and simple spreadsheet application. The latest version runs fine in Lion and the developer is quick to update it when bugs are reported.\nhttp://www.x-tables.eu/more/overview.html\nI still have it and use it on older files that I've not converted to Numbers but Numbers is a more powerful tool and is probably the way to go.\n", "Q: What can the minidisplay port on the MacBook Air do? What features does the minidisplay port on the MacBook Air (early 2010) allow you to do?\nI couldn't find much information about it in the Air's manual. All it said was that it was a video out connection. Does it only work as a monitor repeater (i.e. it shows exactly what is shown on the built-in screen?) or can it also allow the second monitor to behave as a dual screen? (i.e. where you can have some apps on one screen and separate apps on another?)\nIf both are possible, where can I find more information about setting it up? (Preferably, I'm looking for help documents created by Apple.)\n\nA: I am not aware of any manual that contains this information but here is a breakdown, since this is one of the big reasons I got a MacBook originally.\nThe mini display port allows you to add an additional monitor to your MacBook. Support for this is built into the OS directly so you simply connect your external monitor using the correct MD/VGA or MD/HDMI or MD/DVI connector if the monitor does not have a display port and then you can configure how the displays work. This is done under the Displays option in System Preferences.\nFrom the screen shot below you can see I am running a second monitor on my MacBook Pro at the moment and I have set the second monitor to be to the left of the main one by simply dragging it's rectangle to where I want it.\nYou can also move the menu to a different screen by grabbing the white strip on the primary screen and dragging it to another screen you want it on.\nEach display can have it's own separate resolution and even separate backgrounds. The relevant preference panes will automatically show a dialogue on each screen if it supports multiple displays, for example the Desktop & Screensaver will show on both screens.\nYou can also choose whether you want to mirror the display or use it as a second screen. In mirror mode it simply mirrors everything on your main display.\n\n\nA: It's easy :)\nThe mini-display port allows you to connect a second screen.\nTake a look at System Preferences and Screen (I'm not sure if it's the right translation since I'm not on an English Mac). There you can (normally) alter the settings.  \nBut on how and when, it depends from the adapter you use apparently... \n", "Q: Is there an app to ping IP's periodically to check latency? I'm sure I came across a really nice app that would ping a list of sites or IP addresses every x mins/hours and send alerts when it could not ping.\nBut I can't find the app back, anyone know of any good ones?\n\nA: How about a web service that will do this for you?\nCheck out host-tracker.com.  It will ping an IP address (or http-get or traceroute) for you from a collection of sensor sites.  It looks like it will email you error notifications.\nI haven't used the site, so can't speak to how well it works.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if this sends alerts, but it can monitor up to 250 IP addresses at whatever interval you like.  It can display the host, status (as green/yellow/red) and ping time.  \nOn the app store for $1.99:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ping/id412751654?mt=12\n", "Q: How can I bypass Textmate asking for my password every time I save a file? I'm using Lion and every time I edit a file, TextMate prompt me for my password.\nIs there a way to bypass that?\n\nA: Chances are you are trying to save your file somewhere other than under your home directory.  In my experience, Textmate Save dialogs often default to the system root directory.  If you try to save there, you will get an authentication request as you normally would not have write permission.  Expand the Save dialog box and choose somewhere in your home directory tree.\n\nA: Just chmod -R ug+w project-dir (starting from the root of the project)\n", "Q: Are the LaunchPad icons bigger/magnified in Mac OS 10.7.2?

I have iOS 5 on my iPod Touch 4, and I can't find Siri on it. Does it have Siri?\n\nA: Siri is only available on the iPhone 4S and only fully supported within the United States at the moment.\nUnfortunately the page here on Siri does not make that extremely clear, apart from only mentioning the iPhone 4S. I can't find an official source on the Apple site other then that page that specifically says Siri is only available on the 4S.\nSiri supports various languages, however some functionality, like local business searches, will only work in the United States at the moment.\n\nA: There was something the other day that said the software will technically run on the iphone 4 (with IOS 5), but the functionality requires access to Apple's servers...which you can currently only get with the 4S.\n", "Q: How can I login to icloud.com from my iPhone?

Particularly irritating when a number of people share an iPad and don't want to enable full email for each other for example.  I'm afraid there is no way around it, unless perhaps you can download a different browser from the App Store that will enable you to change your user agent string to trick the website into thinking you are using Firefox or something that isn't mobile safari.\n\nA: The  Way To Access iCloud Info is through your phone apps.  Contacts for your adressbook in groups iCloud Will be an automatically created one.  Same with calendars, pages, numbers , etc.  So basically you need to take your wallet out to buy Apple's apps..  I heard that  iWork (which contains pages, numbers and keynote presentations) eventually will become a paid service...\nWorks well though, for phone apps.\nNot all functions are available though has on desktop.\nAnd like mentioned above, browsers where you can choose how the present yourself to the server.

I have some Xcode (iPhone/iPad) development on the horizon and will also be doing a bit of Eclipse (Java) and .NET development in between. Since I'll be running a VM for the Windows stuff, I think a Macbook Pro is the way to go.\nWhat I am wondering is, does the 13\" Pro have enough screen real estate to make development at least a little enjoyable? I looked at the AIR and whilst it has better resolution than the 13\" Pro, it of course lacks in terms of RAM etc. As a consultant I will probably be carrying this thing around quite a lot, so would rather not go with the 15\".\nI will be adding the SSD option to the Pro.\nAny advice much appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: In case anyone is reading this now, the 13\" Retina screens can be put into a higher-resolution scaled mode 1680 x 1050 mode which is still readable. It's the same as the Macbook Pro 17\" I used to use, just in a smaller space.\nThis is ample width for using XCode or other IDEs\n\nA: I have a 15\" MacBook Pro, and I find that I have plenty of screen space for development - most of the time.\nTypically, I have one source file open for editing, and part of another document visible for reference. With this setup, I could easily work on a 13\" model. The problems occur when I want to have two documents side-by-side at full size. Here's a screenshot of how this looks with Xcode running full-screen:\n\nThe two documents aren't wide enough, so I have to scroll more frequently. In order to get the documents to a comfortable width, I have to hide one of the sidebars. On a 13\" screen, you would probably have to hide both. If you use two full-size documents frequently, this could be a problem.\nAnother case to consider is editing non-text files, such as XIBs and Core Data models. The editors for both of these add another sidebar, and the Utilities sidebar (on the right) is much more important for these modes. When working with XIBs, I can fit a single window in the editor pretty well with all sidebars and no assistant editor. On a 13\" screen, I would probably hide the navigation (left) sidebar.\nIn conclusion, the 13\" MacBook Pro will have enough space to work with, except when you need two documents at full size. You may have to hide a sidebar occasionally, but the navigation sidebar usually isn't necessary.\n\nA: There will not be enough space for the actual text editing panel of Xcode. You will need to compensate by hiding sidebars like the different inspectors. Having said that, it is not the end of the world, especially as I begin to learn the different keyboard shortcuts that will show and hide IDE elements (which I haven't yet). \nTo illustrate what I mean I'll say that when I switch over to my virtual machine to work on .NET development with Visual Studio, I feel right at home. The key is knowing your IDE well. In  particular, the keyboard shortcuts to hide and show the helper panels in order to create more text editing space. \nIn other words, I believe that working with Eclipse and Xcode will eventually become as enjoyable for me as Visual Studio once I become more familiar with each IDE, and that is besides the fact that I am working on a 13-inch screen. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Tweets in my Tweetbot timeline are occasionally marked as a favorite when I see them for the first time. Is that a bug or a feature? While looking through my timeline in Tweetbot, occasionally a tweet will be marked as a favorite even though I'm sure I'm seeing it for the first time.  (I can't resist taking the time to unfavorite it.)  I don't see any mention of this in http://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot/.  Is this a bug, or a \"feature\" (where perhaps Twitter's API is doing this)?\n\nA: It's a bug with Twitter, not Tweetbot.\nI've seen people ask @tweetbot about it several times now. The answer and response generally look like this exchange:\n\nQ: @tweetbot keeps favoriting random tweets in my timeline. It's almost embarrassing.\nA: Sorry, that's a Twitter bug. As you can see on Favstar, they're not real favorites.\n\nThat particular exchange happened just yesterday.\nTwitter's REST API bug list has this bug still open where the API may erroneously report a tweet as favorited when in fact it is not.\n\nA: I have seen this happen in the official Twitter app, so it might be a bug in the Twitter API.\n", "Q: How does my iPod touch knows my location (if it doesn't have a GPS)? If there's no GPS in the iPod, how can it know (with such a good precision) my location?\n\nA: GPS uses satellites to triangulate your position with great accuracy, however there are other ways to get a fix provided you can triangulate via other means.  Apple uses a database of WIFI networks with known locations to help ascertain your location in some instances (i.e. if you can see WIFI networks A B and E, then you must be approximately located at Z for example).  Also, using cellular information you can do a similar thing by noting which cells you are able to see and the relative signal strengths you are receiving from them.\nEDIT: Also, it is possible with a lesser degree of accuracy to estimate your location just by using your IP address.  This can be tracked down to a certain extent and while likely not sufficient to be accurate by itself, when you combine this with all the other methods above you can start to get a picture with more accuracy.\n", "Q: Making Airport appear as a computer I live in a building where I am connected to the university network for internet. I am not allowed to connect a router, or I will be kicked off the network. (This rule was created after wrongly configured routers blocked internet access for the entire building.) They expect people to connect their computers all through ethernet.\nI have multiple computers including a MBA and an iPad, so I don't plan to abide by this.\nI know I could configure one of my Macs for internet sharing, but it would have to be running all the time. Since I own an Airport Express I was hoping I could use it instead. Is there a way to configure the Airport so that the network administrators can't detect I'm using a router?\n\nA: Have you tried talking to your campus' Network Administrators? Plead your case! If they ask why, hold up your iPad. You are never going to be running a cable to that thing with the intention of using it on a network. Only power and maybe headphones!\nWorking with them might let you use your wireless with their recommended settings. Maybe bring the Express with you and let them configure it in the manner they want. Maybe they would prefer you NAT yourself, maybe they would prefer you to Bridge the connections.\n\nA: I'm not sure that they are able to detect what you are using to that level at all.  When you connect to the Ethernet port, all that is likely to happen is your device, whether it is a laptop or a router will request an IP address via DHCP, which will then be provided with a lease time of anything from an hour to a year.\nThe only way I can think of that they would be able to detect that this was a router and not a standalone device like a laptop etc would be either:\n1) You give it a name like \"My Airport Router\", which may appear in the DHCP lease list depending on how it has been configured at the server end\n2) The lease time is set to something short, and your router is always plugged in in a way that a laptop would not be.  If your router renews it's lease every hours for a month straight, chances are it's not a laptop.\nTo be honest, if I was after stopping this, I would go around wifi snooping instead, let's face it why would you have a wifi network unless if was to aggregate your devices behind a single IP address in order to share the connection?\n\nA: I would connect an AirPort express to an ethernet port and configure it so that it does not broadcast the SSID. That way, most people won't even notice that there is a Wi-Fi network available when they browse for available Wi-Fi networks, as you can do on a Windows or Mac laptop or iOS device.\nNaturally, your AirPort Wi-Fi network won't be discoverable, which means that your devices won't be able to find it by browsing. But that's okay, since you already know the name for it you will be able to type it manually. And remember, this will only be required the first time you connect to the network. After that, your iPad and Macbook will remember that it is a known network and they will connect to it as if it had been broadcasting its name. \nAn added advantage of the AirPort express is that it does not look like a conventional router. Most people may see it connected to the wall and may think it's a weird Apple charger of sorts. It's a discrete device and may be just perfect for a dorm room. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Can I convert blog entries to wiki articles for Leopard-to-Lion migration? We are migrating our Leopard server to Lion. We were using Group wikis and blogs in such a way that I didn't make much of a distinction, so it came as a shock to realize that Lion Server doesn't support group blogs. Hence, we need to convert the blog entries to wiki articles, which is fine. But, what is the least painful way to go about that?\n\nA: While not a direct, 1-to-1 migration, I found this link which may be of help to at least export the data to CSV. Good luck\n", "Q: How can I force pinch-to-zoom on some websites? As someone with vision issues I typically need to zoom on every single page I load on my iPhone.  \nThe \"three finger tap\" to zoom kinda sucks, so pinch to zoom works great. However since upgrading to iPhone 4S I've noticed a lot of sites don't allow it.\nI know there's a meta tag you can use to disable that feature, but is there an override that you can set to be able to zoom on every page?  I can't zoom in on google results, so I can't really see them. NFL.com doesn't allow pinch to zoom either.\n\nA: You can make a JavaScript bookmarklet to remove the meta tag. \nFirst, press the share button (the icon of the arrow coming out of a box) and press Add Bookmark. Call this “Enable Zoom” or similar. \nThe address box is disabled, but don't worry: there's a way to fix this. \nTap Save, then press the bookmarks button (the book icon), followed by Edit and the bookmark you just made. Now type this in the address box, making sure to not add any spaces:\njavascript:void(document.head.removeChild(document.querySelector('meta[name=viewport]')))\n\nFinally, save this and go to a page that prevents zooming. Go to bookmarks and press the bookmark to run it. You should now be able to zoom in and out. \n(Tip for iPad users: Turn on the bookmarks bar in Settings, then move the bookmark to the Bookmarks Bar folder to have it always be visible under the address bar.)\n\nA: Make sure Zoom is enabled in Settings > General > Accessibility. \nWhen Zoom is enabled, you can double-tap with three fingers to zoom the entire screen of your iPhone/iPod/iPad. To move around, either hold three fingers on the screen and drag to show different parts in the viewport, or hold one finger along the edge of the screen to pan.\nIf you need to zoom in more, double-tap with three fingers and drag up or down. To zoom back out, double-tap again with three fingers.\nBut it gets better: instead of having to double-tap with three fingers to zoom the entire screen of your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, it turns out that enabling the Zoom setting also makes Safari ignore any meta name=\"viewport\" scaling settings on the page. You can zoom in and out the normal way by using two fingers.\n\nbut is there an override that you can set to be able to zoom on every page?\n\nSo basically, the Zoom setting is that override. Enjoy!\nSource\n\nA: Ugh, this is so annoying -- it is the height of designer/developer arrogance (in my opinion -- and I'm a developer myself). The other answer's code did not work for me, but after much experimenting I got this to work (iPad 3/iOS 5):\njavascript:document.querySelector('meta[name=viewport]').setAttribute('content','width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0,user-scalable=1');\n\nUse the same method as the other answer says to add it (create a bookmark for any page, then edit the bookmark and replace its URL with the above code).\n", "Q: Auto change keyboard layout based on application focus I basically use US keyboard for programming and Spanish for everything else, and I´m always switching keyboard layout when I change from browser to VIM or console.\nIn Linux (gnome), keyboard layout was a per application preference, that the window manager remembered automatically, so for every application, if you switched keyboard layout, when you focus back to that application the keyboard layout would change for you.\nIs there any way of doing this in OSX Lion?\n\nA: If you go to System Preferences -> Language & Text -> Input Sources, you should have the option to \"Allow a different one for each document\" under Input source options. \nThe change is per document and not per application, but unless you change the setting for one document when you have several open you might not even notice the difference.\n", "Q: Jailbreaking an iPad 2 with iOS 5 Is it possible to jailbreak an iPad 2 running iOS 5? Please let me know if it's possible. If so, how do I do it?\n\nA: Currently, the answer is no. It is fairly widely known that the A5 is a fairly difficult nut to crack.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Dev Team Pwnage tool info\n\nThe 4.3.1 untether works on all devices that actually support 4.3.1\n  except for the iPad2:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*iPhone3GS\n  \n*iPhone4 (GSM)\n  \n*iPod touch 3G\n  \n*iPod touch 4G\n  \n*iPad1\n  \n*AppleTV 2G (PwnageTool only for now)\n  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Cult of Mac Post On iOS 5 Jailbreaks\n\nAs for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, both devices run Apple’s new A5\n  processor, which is proving to be an absolute bitch to jailbreak.

It came with Leopard and I've already upgraded to Snow Leopard, but now want to download Lion. I'm concerned though that it may slow down my machine. \nI've heard of this before where upgrading OS slows down performance on older hardware.\nHow can one know if they risk a slower performing machine if they update OS?\n\nA: Lion seems to use a lot more memory than Snow Leopard. I had to upgrade my 2 year old iMac from 4GB to 8GB of memory, and it still feels slow sometimes. You may want to avoid the Lion upgrade if you have less than 4GB of memory, and definitely if you have less than 2GB.\n\nA: I upgraded like you from leopard to snow, (on a core duo(not core 2 duo)) MacBook, It ran a lot faster.\nI have also upgraded an Intel core 2 duo from Leopard to Lion and it has also gained in startup speed, effictively it streamlines basic processes. \nI am led to believe (correct if wrong) that it uses the same processing power, but in a different way (hence only compatible with core 2 duo and above.\nAs MacBook Airs were introduced to i processors this year you have a Core 2 Duo - which will run at a faster speed that Snow Leopard.\n", "Q: Can I send an iMessage to a iPad user from my iPhone? I'm amazed I can't figure this out - my friend has an iPad running iOS5. He can send me an iMessage to my phone using my AppleID. But (outside of replying to his message) there is no way for me to send him a message using the Message app, since it only lets me enter phone numbers. \nSo, how does an iPhone user send an iMessage to an iPad user's AppleID?\nEDIT: Does this work for anyone else?\nON AN IPHONE (3GS, if it matters, running iOS 5), open Messages. \nHit the 'Compose' button. \nTry to type in an email address in the 'To' field. \nThere is NO WAY to enter an email address there, afaict\n\nA: How does an iPhone send iMessages to iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure iMessage is set \"on\" on both devices\n\n*On your iPhone, go to Contacts and find your friend's name to check whether or not you have his email address. If not, you need to add his email address.\n\n*On the iPad, go to settings>>messages>>recieve at>>add email. Put your friend's email address from step 2. It will say \"verify\".\n\n*Your friend need to verify by checking his email. There'll be an email from Apple. Open the email and he'll be asked to click on the verify link. Click on it and he'll be directed to Apple's homepage. Just follow the instructions there.\n\n*Once your friend has verified his email address, the word \"verify\" in step 3 disappears. Now you can iMessage him.\n\n*On your iPhone, go to contacts and choose your friend's name. Click on \"send message\" and choose the email address that was just verified. You're now directed to the message screen.\n\n*In the \"To\" field, you 'll see that the email adress is missing \"@\". Ignore it.\n\n*Make sure that the send button is blue. Now just type your message and send.\n\n\nHope this works!\n\nA: psychotik, I think I figured this out. I was having the exact same problem as you. There was no way to type an '@' sign, and selecting from the contact list inside Messages app only shows phone numbers. I had to turn on \"MMS Messaging\" in Settings > Messages.\nThis enabled the @ sign on the keyboard for me. See:\n\nI have no idea why this affects it. I feel like MMS should have nothing to do with whether I can iMessage someone, but it works for me, so I won't complain.\n\nA: First make sure iMessage is turned on on your iPhone; then just create a new message and in the “to” field write your friend’s iMessage address. When you type it all the title bar should change from “Message” to “iMessage”.\n", "Q: How do I restore my iphone?

They can diagnose it and also just restore it and update it for you. And if you're still on the warranty, they might even replace it. Good luck. \n\nA: From the relevant Apple support document, especially the part concerning error 1604:\n\nThis error is often related to USB timing. Try changing USB ports, uninstalling and reinstalling USB ports, and other available USB troubleshooting steps (troubleshooting USB connections, device not recognized properly, computer won't recognize a FireWire or USB device). If you are using a dock, bypass it and connect directly to the white Apple USB dock connector cable.\n\nThe support document further recommends to restart iTunes if 1604 occurs while leaving the phone connected.\n\nA: @patrix's answer is right.\nI had this error as well.  It turned out to be faulty USB hardware.  I used a different computer to restore iOS, then returned to the original computer.  I unplugged every USB device except for the mouse, keyboard and wifi.  I restarted the PC, plugged in the iPhone, started iTunes, and restored from backup.

On iOS 4, they showed up on the iPhone (and iDrive) as follows:\n_First Car Playlist\n_Second Car Playlist\nAnother Playlist\nPlaylist Not For Car\n\nThey showed up at the top of the BMW's playlists, and Voice Control still found them with no trouble.\nAnd along came iOS 5, which seems to trim all non-alphanumeric characters from the beginning of each title before sorting. On iOS 5, they show up as follows (on the iPhone and iDrive):\nAnother Playlist\n_First Car Playlist\nPlaylist Not For Car\n_Second Car Playlist\n\nI tried numerous symbols (.$!,?), all of which were ignored. I can't use numbers, because numbers sort to the bottom of the list, and it's not practical to number every playlist. For now I've renamed them as follows:\na First Car Playlist\na Second Car Playlist\nAnother Playlist\nPlaylist Not For Car\n\nThis works, but it's ugly (less legible), and though Voice Control gets it right when I say \"First Car Playlist\", it reads it back with the leading \"A\", which annoys me. Can anyone else come up with another solution?\n\nA: Oh brother ... I just spent about an hour trying to figure this out myself. I had my playlists in a nice order before this enforced alpha sorting. I hope there will be an update that will allow for some better customization.\nGood news is ... I did find one leading symbol that will push your faves to the top! Without looking too ugly! And the voice command lady doesn't pronounce it!\nHere it is:   ª\n... copy and paste!\nIt's a superscript 'a' used as an ordinal counter in spanish.\nIt'll sort as an 'a' but it's so tiny it doesn't look like much, at least on the ipod screen it's kinda just a speck.\neta: don't know about iDrive or how it might look in the car display\n\nA: Have you tried simply sorting them numerically?\n\n\n*\n\n*First Car Playlist\n\n*Second Car Playlist\n\n*Another Playlist\n\n*Playlist Not For Car\n\n\nHopefully Voice Control picks them up correctly here as well.\n\nA: Thanks for posting this.  It was very frustrating that I couldn't get a couple of my smart playlists that I use the most to be at the top of my Playlists list.\nThe only addition I made to your solution was to make it a double a superscript because if you have any other playlists that begin with the full size letter A then not all of the superscript lists go to the top because it's still sorting it alphabetically, starting with a.  For example, three different lists:\nBusiness\nAsanas\nStudy\nWhen using a single superscript a gets sorted liked this:\nªBusiness\nAsanas\nªStudy\nBecause it's sorting those three items as:\nabu\nasa\nast\nHowever, when I added a second a to the superscript, it came out fine.\nªªBusiness\nAsanas\nªªStudy\nSorted into:\nªªBusiness\nªªStudy\nAsanas\nBecause it was then sorting the three items as:\naab\naas\nasa\n", "Q: iMessaging an iPhone from an iPad I am trying to iMessage an iPhone 4S using its phone number.

I recently installed two certificates (for use in signing mail) on several iOS devices. Both certificates derive from the same trust chain and were purchased from the same vendor on the same day. The only difference between them is that they are associated with different e-mail addresses. Both work fine on OS X in Mac Mail.

Set up VNC aka screen sharing on your mac mini. Log in from another mac /computer , while the TV is off, and set the resolution while no display is attached. If you set that resultion to one that is the same as your attached TV, then when your TV powers on there should be no screen re-size after effects.

Preferably this application would be free, but I would be willing to pay a bit of money.\nIt would be nice if it could encrypt the backups before sending them as well.\nEDIT: Command line solutions are fine as well.\n\nA: If you are willing to use a CLI solution, Duplicity is a network backup system written in python supporting, among other protocols, FTP, SCP and rsync:\n\nDuplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup. Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.\n\nYou will need to install GnuPG to use it (version 1 – it seems Duplicity has some issues with GnuPG 2 in Lion). If you are using a package manager, both Duplicity and GnuPG should be available through it (confirmed for homebrew). See the installation instructions here.\nTo run it in the background, I suggest creating a launchd task (aka LaunchAgent).\n", "Q: Exactly what are the limitations of geofenced reminders? One of the most exciting new features since iOS5 is the ability to setup reminders - and even better - the ability to setup geofenced reminders based on when you arrive or leave a location.\nI have two key questions about how these work in practice and I was wondering if anybody could answer them based on their experiences.\n\n\n*\n1.) If I am sitting in location A but plan to leave and setup a reminder that will go off when I arrive back in location A - will that work?\n\n\ni.e. if you are in your office and are going to be leaving for a meeting and want to remember to do something when you get back can you setup that alert before you leave or will it just go off immediately because you are already there?\n\n\n*\n2.) I live in Manhattan and my home address (stored in my contact information) is not what my iPhone thinks my location is when I am sitting in my apartment. My iPhone thinks I am three buildings down and across the street. Will geofenced reminders work if I tell them to remind me when I get \"Home\" even though \"Home\" is not exactly where iPhone GPS thinks I live?\n\n\nNB: My one-off test of this shows that it does not correctly identify me as being home. It looks like I would have to tell it to remind me when I get to the incorrect address that iPhone thinks is home. I would think it would have some radius to allow for inaccuracies of GPS - would be best if you could SET this radius!\n\nA: I'll split your question into two main areas since one is easily answerable, the other isn't without inside knowledge of how location services work within iOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to make a reminder for when you re-arrive at the place you sit now?\n\n*What is the special sauce and all the ways I can tweak location in iOS?\n\n\nTo make a reminder, start by turning on \"At a Location\" and then choose when I arrive instead of the default when I leave. Sometimes I have poor location signal and the alarm may go off, but that seems to happen very rarely in practice. When that happens, I just set it to when you leave. That seems to be less sensitive to radius so when it goes off, I then remember to change it back to arrival.\n\nThe deeper question of how location really works and is implemented is not publicly disclosed. As an end user, you can't set radius or other parameters that affect the location engine. It is either off or on. You either have the radios on or off. \nI would encourage you to get Xcode and play with some of the demonstration projects to learn how location works in the iOS simulator and perhaps you can gain a better understanding of how iOS presents this data to apps.\n\nA: The Reminders app doesn't expose all the functionality of geofencing that the iOS 5 api allows. So a third party app could give you some more options about this.\nThere's a location manager object that the OS maintains, and developers interface with that to configure location services, and to be informed about things that have happened inside the core location framework.\nOne thing that the location manager can do is, it can be set up to monitor a list of regions. Each region has a center point and a radius. It has to be circular, but you can set how big a circle.\nThe other thing you can tell the location manager when registering a region to be watched is the \"accuracy\"--how far \"past\" the boundary of that region the user has to be before firing the \"We're here!\" message into the client code. That's useful to account for exactly what you're seeing. Where you are, your GPS accuracy is low, so it'd be good if the jitter introduced into the data by larger-grained positioning methods wasn't firing alerts willy nilly just because you happened to be in the ballpark of your region.\nNone of this configurability is exploited in the OS's reminders app--it just takes an address and builds a region around it. In my experience it's probably got a fairly large \"accuracy\" setting. An alert leaving my office fires maybe 1/8 mile down the road. An alert arriving at my home fires as I pull into my driveway. So maybe it's 100 meters plus or minus 75?\n", "Q: Are non-public Game Center Profiles not listed in \"friends in common\"?

I have a fair sized software development library in e-book format and I can't begin to say how annoying this is when I am trying to manage (or use) e-books.  I can't say enough how I don't want audio books appearing in alphabetical order mixed in with my developer library.  Removing the \"audiobook\" designation will make the impossible task of separating modern and classical music on iTunes that much more aggravating.\nI used to have a similar problem with podcasts being in the same app as everything else, and I solved that by switching to an iOS podcast app: it downloads podcasts, stores them outside of the media library, remembers my place even after I have been listening to music, and is far easier to operate than the Music app.\nUnfortunately, every iOS audiobook player app I have found seems to use the iTunes media library for its storage, solving only half of my frustration.\nAny suggestions for audiobook management and playing alternatives on iOS?\n\nA: I have been trying to answer this question for myself for ages. I've only recently found the solution for me - SpeedUp Player Pro seems to have all of the audiobook functionality I need. The hightlights are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Speed up (up to TRUE 2.5x)\n\n*Load items from Dropbox\n\n*Adjustable Forward and Backward Skip\n\n*A/B Repeat (for studying)\n\n*Gestures\n\n*Functional free version with some features disabled.\n\n\nThe app is not rock-solid in terms of stability, but I expect it will get there as the developer continues to work on it.\nThe developer's name is mix1009 and there is a link to his/her website.\n\nA: I too have tried SpeedUp Player (the Lite version), and it does a good job with configuring the playback speed.  However, it has one really annoying defect that makes it unusable: when your iPhone goes into rest mode, the app stops playing the book at the end of the audio track.  With audiobooks have tracks going 3-5 minutes, I am constantly having to wake up my iPhone, move to the next track and start playing again.  On long driving trips, this is exceptionally distracting and furiously frustrating.\nI don't know if this defect is fixed in the current Pro version, or if it was an intentional limitation of the Lite version (the documentation makes no mention of it, so I assume it's a bug).  Either way, it seems an unfortunate lack of insight, and I am not shelling out the Pro money to update it, unless I know it has been fixed.\n", "Q: How to recover data from iPhone backup files WITHOUT the info.plist, status.plist, manifest.plist, manifest.mbdb, and manifest.mbdx files? I have iTunes 10.5 and Mac OS X version 10.6.8.\nI would like to restore my iPhone from backup.\niTunes detects all my backups EXCEPT one, which happens to be the backup I want. \nI looked in the backup directory (~/library/application support/mobilesync/backup) and IT IS THERE along with the other backups. HOWEVER, unlike the other backups, it's missing five files: info.plist, status.plist, manifest.plist, manifest.mbdb, and manifest.mbdx. \nI have tried applications that can extract data, like the free iPhone Backup Extractor for example, but they work only if I have the five files. \nIs there a way to recover data without the five files?\n\nA: It depends whether the remaining files you have are from an encrypted backup.\nIt won't be feasible to read your backup data if you have an encrypted backup with no Info.plist, Status.plist, or Manifest.mbdx files \nHowever, if your backup wasn't encrypted, it will be possible to read that data. You'll find that whilst the filenames are unhelpful (they're SHA-1 hashes of the file's internal path), the file contents easily readable. It's only the filenames that'll be lost.\nIf you're looking for images, try renaming a bunch of the files to have .JPG extensions, and see whether Windows Explorer or macOS Finder previews them for you.\nThere are a few approaches for digging into what's there in bulk. You mentioned using iPhone Backup Extractor, and there's a guide on how a use \"Bulk Rename Utility\" to read backup data when in this situation.\n\nA: Directly restoring from iTunes backup, you have no choice by restoring the entire backup. It's the rule from Apple. But if you still need to do this, you can choose to find an iTunes backup extract tool, which is usually used to extract the iTunes backup file. Then you can preview and selectively recover whatever you want from it.\n", "Q: Can I share iBooks with another device that is authorized for the purchasing account? Is there a way to share iBooks with a device without connecting it to the machine running iTunes with the purchasing account?\nI know that it is possible to download iBooks to a device that uses a different Store account by connecting the device to the machine machine running iTunes with the purchasing account; but is it possible to do so with a device that syncs to iTunes on a different machine (using a different account)?\n\nA: iBooks, like all items bought in the iTunes store, can be shared across different iTunes libraries via iTunes Home Sharing. As Apple states:\n\nHome Sharing in iTunes is designed to let you easily share your iTunes media libraries between up to five computers in your household.\n\nAll libraries setup for sharing with the same ID can import purchases made with that ID, independently of the ID they normally use for purchases in the iTunes store.

While I'm waiting for my iPhone 4S to come in, I'm agonizing over what kind of case to get. I've been quite well served by my Otterbox Defender for my old 3GS; the phone has bitten the dust once or twice but the phone doesn't have a single scratch to show for it.\nI'm concerned, however, about the pictures of the case on Otterbox's website. It looks like the entire earpiece, perhaps along with the entire camera lens area, are exposed to the air. Someone asked about this on that page's Q&A section, and that's the only question so far that's been ignored.\nI'm worried that dust and dirt are going to be able to get inside the case and stay trapped there, possibly damaging the device and hurting its later resale value more than if I just use a different, less protective case altogether. Of course, nothing hurts a device's resale value more than being dropped and broken.\nSo I ask you wonderful people: Do any of you have experience with this latest Otterbox Defender? Is  the speaker or the camera lens actually exposed to the air, or is there some protection there that I can't tell from the pictures? Are there any other considerations I should make before making my decision?\n\nA: I own the Otterbox Defender Case for the iPhone 4S. The speaker for the earpiece, the speakers on the bottom and the camera lens (but not flash) are exposed to air. The Defender offers some protection because the thickness of the case creates a cavity roughly 3mm deep around the exposed speakers. These cavities DO collect dust. \nWhen I opened my case to answer this question I found only a very slight amount of dust infiltration within a very close vicinity of the openings \"exposed to air\". I do not believe this dust will in any way damage the phone or mar the finnish (because the slight dust inside was more like \"fuzz\" than \"grit\") but I have only had my case for a few weeks. I have a screen protector on the front of my phone and on the back too, with the Defender case on top of that. \nThe biggest annoyance for me with this case is that dust collects in the \"protective\" cavity for the camera lens and is not easy to clean on-the-go (you need something like a q-tip or rolled piece of tissue) which makes my HD camera take blurry pictures. \nI would recomend Otterbox include a silicone cover for the camera lens like they have included for the charge port, headphone port and silent button -OR- re-design the shape of the cavity to collect less dust or allow the user to wipe the lens with a finger or cloth to clear dust. \n\nA: Otterbox defender for galaxy s5 is worthless with the camera lens completely exposed to all job hazards of a construction site. Wasted money on otterbox. Instead ended up using $5.00 fake leather case i bought off a street vendor for the last few years...\n", "Q: How do I view my iCloud Photo Stream online? I set up iCloud when I installed iOS 5 on my iPhone and was excited about Photo Stream. I logged into icloud.com and found there are no photos. What gives? I was hoping that this would end the need to selectively pull photos off my phone, then upload, then share. But it looks like you can only sync between iOS devices and Lion (which I don't have). Is there a web interface or some other way to see these photos?\n\nA: There is also already a mechanism to sync PhotoStream photos to Windows PCs.\nSee the PC instructions on 'How to set up iCloud'.\nI've used this and it works well. It adds a new folder to your PC, wherever your pictures are currently stored (e.g. the Pictures library, if on Windows 7).\nOnce they've been synced to the PC, you can just upload them using whatever software you'd normally use...\n\nA: It's not so clear from the other answers but it is now possible to enable the creation of publicly accessible website of selected photos from selected photo stream. Basically you need to enable (Settings -> Photos & Camera) 'Shared Photo Streams' on your iOS device - You don't need to enable My PhotoStream for this to work. Then from the Photos app you can create a shared photo stream from a bunch of photos for which you can enable (Photos app -> Shared tab -> People tab) 'Public Website'. This link can be shared and also has options for adding subscribers who can post (in iOS8).  \n\nA: \nUpdate: Apple now allows you to share your Photo Stream with others. More info on the official Photo Stream page here\n\nAt the moment no. The only way to access your stream is from a Lion Machine using either iPhoto or Aperture, or from another iOS 5.0 device with Photo Stream enabled.\nI am not entirely sure if Apple is going to allow a sharing portal, however at the moment I take the images I want to share and upload them to Flickr through iPhoto once they are in my Photo Stream.\nI suspect they currently use Photo Stream as a personal backup and sharing solution between devices, and not global sharing.\n\nA: You can select all the pictures in the photostream in your phone and click on the save button: it will save all those pictures in the Camera Roll, and next time when you connect phone with PC, you can see all of them in iPhone drive in My Computer.\n", "Q: How do I refresh / check new mail in Mail? How do I refresh / check new mail in Mail? \nBy default, I don't see a toolbar button to do so in Mail 5.1 on Lion.\n\nA: Or you can just edit your settings to get all the mail every minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes,...\nIt's under preferences - general. I've got it on 1 minute, so I never have to hit the button Diago described :)\n\nA: ...or you can go to the mailbox menu and \"synchronize all accounts.\"\nAlso, holding down the Control key while pushing any of the buttons on the button bar will allow you to quickly change to \"icon and text\" to show what the buttons do, then quickly turn text off once you're clear.\n\nA: Apple Mail's check for mail icon looks like a new mail message icon, and can be found here:\n\nIf it can't be found you can add by right-clicking on the toolbar and choosing customize:\n\nYou can then select the icon from the list and drag it to the toolbar at the top:\n\nYou can also use \"Mailbox\" -> \"Get All New Mail\" which has a shortcut ⌘ + ⇧ + N.\nYou don't need to synchronize. Synchronize does more than a new mail check (see this answer)\n", "Q: How to get data from apps when upgrading to iOS 5 on an iPad 2 I updated my iPad 2 to iOS 5 using my Windows PC. \nI backed up my apps, calendar, mail, photos, etc. using iTunes before the iOS 5 update. However, although I got my apps, I am missing all the data in them! For instance: for iAnnotate PDF I am missing all my annotated files, in Note Taker HD I am missing all my notes, and most importantly in bizXpensTrkr I am missing all my business receipts and data!\nCan someone please advise in layman's terms? I am new to Apple and used a PC to update.\n\nA: Do you still have your backup? \nConnect your iPad, right click it in iTunes' sidebar and select restore from backup (Sometimes it helps to restore from backup twice).\n", "Q: iPad wake up to an app Is there a way I can set my iPad to always open a particular ap when I wake it up (open my smart cover)?\nI'm specifically interested in doing this with a text editor.\n\nA: Evernote Peek can do this. It's an app which allows you to close your smartcover (don't know if you have one) and when reopening it, the app is still open.\nSo, yes it's possible. \n", "Q: When restoring In-App Purchases, is there any limit to how many devices I can restore my In-App purchased content? Suppose I have multiple iOS devices, say more than 5, and I purchase a gun through In-App Purchase, after I restore my purchases, will that gun be available in all my devices, in that game?\nJust want to know, if the 5 devices authorization works in this case too\nThanks\n\nA: An in-app purchase confers the same rights and suchlike as a standard purchase.  But it may be confusing to get it included depnding on how you purchased it.  For iOS5 the App store has cleverly included informative info such as \"install\" or \"installed\" rather than just showing the price of an app.  I would assume that apps that use in-app purchases that are fully iOS5 updated would also show such information, but I fear that the purchase mechanism is not necessarily so controlled in terms of what it looks like.  Some apps have a \"restore purchases\" function, others may just list the purchases available but then not charge you when you repeat download an item (on the assumption that is is not one of those \"buy 1000 credits\" purchases that can be legitimately purchased multiple times) like pre iOS5 app store did.\nIf you purchase on one device, buy the in-app item, backup to itunes, then use it to sync the app and data (inc. purchases) out to the other devices it should work fine and be less potentially confusing.\n", "Q: Information/File Manager I'm looking for a file manager application which helps to organize a large amount of movies, pictures, music, text documents, databases, audio-books and ebooks. Right now I only use the Finder which doesn't work well, because I really need a function to put single files into multiple categories. Simply using the file system for this creates a confusing nesting of files.\n\nA: Depending on the number of categories you require to handle, you could always use a combination of the finder with the built in label functionality, thus a movie can be held in one area (movies directory, for example), but \"tagged\" as something else.  Using smart directories and saved searches you can view your files by a combination of the attributes (location, label, media type) to create custom views.  All without purchasing software.  Cheap and cheerful, but may be suitable to your needs.\n\nA: I use Leap. A meta tag organiser, possibly the best for OS X. \n\nIronic Software, developer of Leap, was at the forefront of development of OpenMeta. Three owners in the Google Code area:\n\n\n*\n\n*ironicsu...@…\n\n*neuma...@…\n\n*tom.ande...@…\n\n\nMavericks Tagging In The Wild (2013-10-17) described Tom Anderson from Ironic Software as one of the creators of OpenMeta. https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMeta describes him as a maintainer. \n\nA: I don't use it myself, but I've heard a lot of good things about Bare Bones Software's Yojimbo\nAlso, note that iTunes and iPhoto cover a lot of the file types you mention (just not all in the same application).\n\nA: Maybe use a file manager that supports Open Meta.\nOr use symbolic links for organizing all your media files.\nOr even use hardlinked files if you dare.\n\nA: Pathfinder may be what you are looking for. It's a replacement for the Finder that offers a great deal of \"power user\" features, such as dual pane browsing, tabs, and a drop stack. I'm not sure if it offers the sorting tools that you desire, but regardless, give Pathfinder a look.\n\n\nA: CompendiumNG (CNG)\nFrom History and Motivation:\n\nInitial Development\n… built upon Compendium which was developed by the Compendium Institute, driven by the Knowledge Media Institute (KMi) at The Open University UK. The Open University group in turn built on the development of the Compendium “Conversational Modelling” methodology developed in the late 1990s by Al Selvin and Maarten Sierhuis at NYNEX Science & Technology Labs, NY (now Verizon). …\n\nAnd:\n\n… Motivation\nDuring our search of a diagramming tools that would be more flexible than usual mind-mapping application we found only few that didn’t limit its’ features to mind mapping but brought its’ own idea about diagraming complex issues. One of them was Compendium designed for dialog mapping based on the IBIS notation. Compendium expressiveness allows to diagram complex issues and in a way supersedes traditional mind-mapping by not forcing users into strict hierarchical mapping. On top of it, while based on IBIS notation it can be used more generally and it has some unique features not seen in other similar applications. For many users Compendium was a software of choice for various tasks and from our point of view an application with such unique features set should be further developed and improved.\nIn 2009 The Open University released Compendium as Open Source under the the LGPL license. However, in 2012, Compendium development was in a state where developement looked stalled. We therefore decided to continue the Compendium development, to fix bugs and improve it. For this we migrated software development to a GitHub repository and set up this project site. CompendiumNG (short CNG) now continues the development of Compendium. Our main motivation was to renew and revive the development of Compendium. With the development of CompendiumNG we are trying to bring a great software back to life and we hope that the usage and the CompendiumNG community will further grow into the future.\n\nMy own use of Compendium was rare, but enjoyable.\nFor each file that you drop into Compendium there are two options. Either:\n\n*\n\n*link to the original; or\n\n*copy to the Linked Files directory\n\n– if you choose the first option, take care to not move the original.\nWith or without drag-and-drop of files, Compendium has a powerful and flexible approach to management of information. When I last experimented, it was with a view to shared access; there was an option to use MySQL.\nNot far from where I worked, someone else on campus made far greater use of Compendium; it was powerful and highly respected. I should expect CompendiumNG to have the same qualities.\n\nMore nebulous, patented by Apple\nGraphical Multidimensional File Management System and Method (2014-02-09) under Apple Acquires 18 'Axis-Based User Interface' Patents from Maya-Systems | MacRumors Forums\n\nFaceted classification\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\na classification scheme used in organizing knowledge into a systematic order. … semantic categories, either general or subject-specific, that are combined to create the full classification entry. Many library classification systems use a combination of a fixed, enumerative taxonomy of concepts with subordinate facets that further refine the topic. …\n\nThe subheading personal information management is essentially a single paragraph, a single product –\n\nThe HyperSet system formalised faceted classification using set theory, and implemented a prototype retrieval system, many of whose features are implemented in the Tinderbox personal content manager.\n\n– with reference to Don't Link Me In: Set Based Hypermedia for Taxonomic Reasoning (H. Van Dyke Parunak), pages 233-242 of the Proceedings of the third annual ACM conference on Hypertext (HYPERTEXT '91).\nhttp://aetos.it.teithe.gr/~cs1msa/hyperset.htm introduces HyperSet (Parunak, 1991) as:\n\na set based hypermedia prototype system designed to support an alternative model for structuring hypermedia information. This alternative model is intersecting sets of nodes and support of taxonomic reasoning.  Fundamental entity in HyperSet are sets, each containing zero or more artifacts (analogous to conventional hypermedia nodes). The basic browsing operation in  HyperSet is not moving from a node to node but moving from an artifact to a set which is a member and then to another member of that set. Traversing a link with multiple destinations is possible. A user can add or remove a artifact to a set in an analogous procedure of creating a link.\n\nBeyond that 1991 HyperSet system, I expect readers to find other personal information managers that use faceted classification.\n", "Q: SMEStorage with Dropbox on the iPad I was looking around for ways to get my iWork documents from iWork into Dropbox; going through a forum post on the dropbox website I came accross SMEStroage do any of you use this? If how does it work?\n\nA: SMEStorage is a cloud storage service, similar to DropBox itself. In the scenario you are referring to, you can use the SME Storage API directly to upload to an external file provider like DropBox.\nEffectively like DropBox you can store everything on the SMEStorage Servers and then access it from any OS/Device as long as you have an internet connection. \nFrom reading the documentation it is really a more advanced DropBox service, which allows developers to use their API to have a central point for accessing various storage options. \nFrom what I can determine, like iCloud, the application needs to support the actual API and interface to be able to store data through it, and since iWorks on iOS only supports iCloud, I am not sure if it will solve your problem.\n\nA: I use SMEStorage to edit and save my DropBox, Google Docs and SkyDrive documents with iWork on iPhone and iPad (although it support many other Clouds).\nIf you buy the SMEStorage iOS App (called iSMEStorage) then you can add the Clouds to it that you want to use with iWork (or any other WebDav client)  to the App and when you launch iWork you use the URL https://WebDAV.SMEStorage.com to then access your Cloud files in iWork.\nClouds added to your SMEStorage Account are WebDav enabled by an access layer that SMEStorage refer to as CloudDav.\n\nA: Can validate that SMEStorage will enable you to not only access your DropBox Docs directly in iWork but also edit and save them. To add to the previous answer by Carl, you don't need to purchase iSMEStorage to get this feature, you can sign up for a free account and pay a one time $5 fee for the CloudDav product (http://smestorage.com/?p=static&page=CloudDav)\n", "Q: Where are iOS 5 Camera Roll folders stored when synced with Windows? iOS 5 has introduced the ability to create folders in the image library, and copy pictures from the camera roll to these folders. \nWhen synced on a PC (on Windows 7), where are those pictures stored? How can they be managed on the computer? \nI'd like to find them to be able to save them, and add/remove some pictures from those folders.\nI know the way to add \"hard\" folders to the image library from the PC, but those can't be managed on the iPhone.\n\nA: The sync image location would be the same as the one you have selected as your Sync folder via iTunes Photo sync. I have also found a less complicated - drag/drop method for a two-way iPhone photo transfer between your device and the PC. It is less of a hassle since you can manage your iPhone photos, add and move them around and sync them to your PC directly from your computer.\n\nA: Mine get put into my pictures folder in the same place you iPhone puts them when it asked when y plug iPhone in it should ask do you  take pictures off because computer thinks my iPhone is a camera so it ask to download photos\n", "Q: I removed some songs from my directory, how do I tell iTunes to remove them from my library? I have all my songs in a folder, when I need to add songs I do \"Add folder to library\"\nNow I have deleted some songs from my folder, how do I tell iTunes to check which songs were removed and remove them from my library to remove them from my iPod?\n\nA: iTunes has no functionality to actually scan for missing songs from it's library. If you want to delete Music, you need to do it from within iTunes, and not the other way around. It can however identify missing files which normally appear with an ! mark next to their names. These can simply just be deleted out of the library manually.\nThere are some 3rd Party options to try and do this automatically:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleScript Scan Missing is an AppleScript solution if your using a Mac or this AppleScript from MacOSXHints. \n\n*For Windows you can use the iTunes Library Scanner mentioned in this iLife article.\nOnce you have removed the songs from the iTunes library, they will be removed of your iPod the next time it synchronizes.\n\nA: I've found the easiest way to do this, detailed in the answer here :\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/35813/646\nNo need for third party tools.\n", "Q: How to share Mac System which has Lions OS 10.7? I was able to share my mac system screen using VNC server in Snow leopard OS but now I have upgraded the my Mac OS to Lion OS. Now VNC server is not compatible with Lion OS.\nSo can any one help me how to share my Mac system so that others can access my system remotely and run the iPhone application in XCode and able to see the iPhone simulator.\n\nA: Have you checked out the built in Screen Sharing in OS X? Check out System Preferences -> Sharing -> Screen Sharing. Click on the Computer Settings button and you should see a dialog which allows you to enable VNC connections.\nYou should then be able to use any VNC Client like Chicken of the VNC to connect to the remote system running Lion.\n", "Q: Does downgrading Lion to Snow Leopard also downgrade firmware? Ever since I installed Lion I've had problems with wifi. Connections would drop, and once wifi was turned off it wouldn't turn back on. Now, I can't use it at all - it says \"No hardware installed.\"\nThe same problem also exists in Windows on my Boot Camp partition, so I think it's a firmware or hardware issue. I'd like to fix it by downgrading to Snow Leopard, but would this also downgrade the wifi firmware?\n\nA: No. Firmware is outside the scope of traditional OS updates (e.g., 10.7.2). On Macs, there is actually no way to revert a firmware update (even if you download a prior revision).\n", "Q: How do I add the phonetic contact fields to a contact on iOS 5 when using an iPhone 4? Recently I have seen some interesting tips for increasing the accuracy of Siri by entering phonetic details for contacts with names that is has trouble understanding or saying correctly.  \nThis involves editing a contact, adding a new field, then selecting either phonetic first name or phonetic last name. E.g. Shuvawwn instead of Siobhan.\nWhile I do not have Siri as I run an iPhone 4 not 4S, I have still seen these tips pre-dating iOS 5 to help with voice control as was before Siri came along.\nThe problem is that I do not appear to have these fields available on my iPhone at all.\nHow can I get them to show?  Is there some language or accessibility setting or other required to get them to appear?\n\nA: I can confirm after testing that these fields are not available on the iPhone 4 in iOS5, although they are available on the iPhone 4S.\nHowever, if you have your contacts synced with Address Book on the Mac, you can add the field to the contact card via the Add Field menu item under Contact, and the field is then sent to your iPhone on the next sync. I am not able to confirm if you can do this via the iCloud web interface directly.\n\nA: It's looking like a bug.\nOn the phone, if I have a contact that already has a first and last name entered, there is still an option to add a further first and last name field.  If I add and fill in the fields, then view the contact in iCloud.com when it has synced, it shows the phonetic first and last names as already in use, with the details I entered.  If I remove the additional fields, and then try to add them back using the phonetic first and last names fields which are available on the website version, then sync back they sync to the additional first/last name fields as originally shown.\nSo, in short it looks like they forgot to include the word \"phonetic\" on iOS5 running on (at least) iPhone 4, the fields are there, and they sync correctly, they just do not show properly.\n\nA: When editing a contact, scroll to the bottom of the edit pane and tap \"Add a new field.\"  You should see phonetic first name and last name. Add the fields and you should be all set. \n\nA: On my iPhone 4S the 'Phonetic First Name' and 'Phonetic Last Name' did not show. The video shows how I fixed the issue. I basically learnt that the reason for that was the 'British English' Language setting, which I had to set to 'English'. After I did that the fields became visible. It really did not seem obvious to me at first. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_tJrkwX1Jg&feature=context&context=C4e47384ADvjVQa1PpcFPwAjivWq8TSDyCDVg1gSKGheHMZNvapUE=\n", "Q: How can I turn on the browser's cookie functionality?

I wrote a small shell script to spoof my wireless interface mac address. I'd like to run this script on my mac (snow leopard) before the airport utility starts and attempts to connect to an access point.

After I upgraded to IOS 5.0 (BTW im using an IPAD 2) it started crashing so I re-installed it (delete then install) . Now after the free levels are over it asks me for money again to upgrade :( ? What is the solution to this. And ya BTW when i deleted it i also deleted all game data(it prompted) as I was still early into the levels and I thought that may be cause of crash.\nAppreciate any help in this regard!!!\n\nA: Until iOS 5 if you downloaded an app, and then removed it, then went back into the App store, then tried to download it again, it would still look like you were going to pay again until after you enter your iTunes password, at which point it would cross check against your purchase history and confirm that it would actually be free.\nIn iOS5 this behaviour has changed to show informative information such as \"install\" or \"installed\" rather than just show the price like it did previously.\nI suspect that the in-app purchase mechanism is just a little behind the curve, especially if the app has not yet been updated fully for iOS5 (it hasn't - last update March 18, 2011).  I would confirm that the in app purchase history appears in your purchase history (use iTunes on your PC/Mac and check your account section for the easiest way to see this), and so long as it appears, I would proceeed and enter my password anyway, chances are that the old behavious will still apply, and it will happily just redownload it.  If it does by any chance charge you again, you can easily take it up with apple, and either you remember incorrectly or it's come down in price but I just took a look (to check the in-app purchase wasn't one of the \"buy 100 coins\" type that you can legitimately buy again and again) and it's currently only £0.69\n", "Q: What's a good Picasa upload app for iPhone? Android has \"Instant Upload\" with the Google+ app. I'd like something similar for iPhone: an app that takes all my photos and uploads them to a private album on Picasa Web Albums. Jailbreak alternatives are fine too.\nSearching the App Store for the word \"picasa\" gives me far too many results. There are some Picasa album-browsing apps, and a few uploading tools (mostly paid; free versions only upload thumbnails). Rather than testing out all 59+ apps myself, perhaps some fellow users here have personal experiences and recommendations?\nI'm using Linux on my pc. This means that iTunes is not an option. (Yes, it's a hassle...) I am looking for something that can upload straight from iPhone to web, without requiring a computer as a middle step. \nBonus points for operation in the background, but I'll accept an app that requires to be foreground -- as long as it can upload.\n\nA: I use Web Albums and it works well. It's currently $2.99 on the US store.\n\nA: Seems like the new answer is the Google+ app for iOS.\n\nA: Photoforge2 is an excellent photo editing app for both iPhone and iPad that uploads to Picasa and just about everything else. It's a real bargain too: £0.69 in the UK/$0.99 in the US.\nThere are plenty of other options too: see my round up of iPad photo apps over on photo.stackexchange.com.\n\nA: I used PhotoSync (US$1.99) and was impressed by its features. You can not only upload to Picasa but also Flickr, Dropbox and other services, including to your computer or another iphone/iPad.\n", "Q: No Bootable Device error when trying to install Win7 on a MBP (mid 2007 SR) / Lion After formatting the HDD to a single HFS+ Journaled partition and installing a clean 10.7 System on the machine, I ran the Boot Camp Assistant, created the CD with drivers and partitioned the disk. I then put the Windows7 DVD+R in the machine which I had created on another Windows machine by using the Microsoft USB/DVD/Download Tool to burn our site license image to a disc. \nAfter partitioning, the machine restarts, but just shows the text \"No bootable device -- Insert boot disk\". Then, nothing more happens. When I shut the machine down and reboot it while holding option down, I see that the DVD appears twice in the list of bootable devices - once as \"Windows\" and once as \"EFI Boot\". Both do lead to the same error if selected for booting.\nThe installation disk itself works perfectly in \"normal PC\". I nevertheless burned another one, it doesn't work either. I then used the Microsoft Tool to create a bootable USB stick. But this neither shows up in the Startup Disk preference nor when holding option during startup.\nI had an older Windows XP disc lying around which I then tried on this machine. It installed without flaw. However, the Lion Boot Camp drivers do not support XP anymore and anyway I need to install Win 7 on the machine.\nThis all leaves me to these conclusions: Boot Camp Assistant worked and has created a usable partition (see XP install). The installation discs for Win 7 are also correctly set up (they boot on a PC) and work. Booting Windows 7 from a USB device apparently is unsupported on my machine.\nWhich leaves me clueless. All parts on their own seem to work. Any idea why they don't work together?\n\nA: In the end, I couldn't make the machine boot from the DVD. However, I found a workaround that I want to share for anyone with a similar problem: I used VMware Fusion to boot the Boot Camp partition from OS X. I then set up the VM to boot from the iso I made the DVD from (might have worked with the DVD as well, didn't try). After running through the part of the installation where the base system was written to disk and the system wanted to restart, I turned off the VM, booted from the Boot Camp partition and (with Win7 DVD in drive) then ran through the rest of the installation procedure without problem.\n\nA: Hard to say exactly, but here's what I would try next based on the EFI Boot partition showing up in the boot selector:\nReset the PRAM by holding Apple-Option-P-R at the chime, and allow it to chime two or three times before releasing those keys. Then try booting from the Windows CD again.\n", "Q: Can you copy files to /Applications using Launchbar? For lot of applications, the disc image (.dmg) contains the .app files which needs to be copied to the /Applications folder. \nI use Launchbar's Instant Send feature to open the selected files quickly in some text editor. Is there a way I can use this feature to quickly send a selected application to /Applications?\n\nA: Once you use the Instant Send hotkey to select the file in Launchbar...\n\nYou can start typing \"Applications\" to select your /Applications folder.\n\nThen press Return and select Copy to \"Applications\" from the menu.\n\n", "Q: What happens to application data when I update vs uninstall an iOS app? When I update my apps on iOS the configuration for the apps are always maintained, including passwords. I am wondering someone knows if the data is kept when I (as end-user) uninstall apps as well.\nThe questions here are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the Update on iOS actually is an uninstall and then install or really a different operation than uninstall?\n\n*Is there a real uninstall or is it simply a delete?\n\n\nGiven that the app provider is not capable to distinguish between end-user uninstall and update, how is the configuration data expected to be secured? \n\nA: It's a delete and re-install. A new copy is downloaded from the AppStore, and the actual application file is deleted off the device, and then re-copied. It's the same operation as when you uninstall, just with an immediate install.\nThe data for the application is kept separately, and when you choose to delete an application via the springboard, it will prompt you to delete the data associated with the application.\nWhen updating, it is assumed that you want to keep this data, and it is also part of the backup that is made when the device is backed up.\n\nA: User data is kept in very specific areas on iOS apps, and there are further areas (cache and tmp) where data can be stored temporarily which can be recreated on the fly (or by redownload) if required.  Until iOS5 an update via the App Store would be a full reinstall, effectively, but preserving the user data area so that your updated Angry Birds would retain your high scores etc.  Delete the app, however, and you delete these user areas as well, as they are unable to exist outside of the app (they are sandboxed, and not available via a filesystem like mechanism etc.\nTo secure these areas, backup via iTunes.  The App (or the latest binary version of it) is stored as well as the user data.  It's possible to download an app, create some data, back it up, remove teh app & data, then update the app from within iTunes without installing it on your phone, and then add the app back into your sync list, at which point it will push over the new binary and repopulate teh user areas with your saved data.\nI believe from iOS 5onwards a \"delta\" upgrade is possible, whereby rather than reinstall the whole app over the top (retaining user data) you only download the bits that have changed, but I cannot find the exact details right now.  Certainly future OS updates will happen in this way, and I am sure it was coming if it has not already come to app store downloads, both on the Mac and iOS app stores.\n", "Q: Proper group ID (gid) for Lion? If you create a brand new admin account in Lion, the following will be your id and group memberships (from $ id [new Lion account] | perl -lne 's/ /\\n/g; s/,/\\n\\t/g; print;'):\nuid=504(lt)\ngid=20(staff)\ngroups=20(staff)\n    402(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)\n    12(everyone)\n    33(_appstore)\n    61(localaccounts)\n    79(_appserverusr)\n    80(admin)\n    81(_appserveradm)\n    98(_lpadmin)\n    100(_lpoperator)\n    204(_developer)\n    403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2)\n    401(com.apple.access_screensharing)\n\nIn contrast, an older OS X account will have these uid, gid, etc:\nuid=501(andrew)\ngid=501(andrew)\ngroups=501(andrew)\n    403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2)\n    204(_developer)\n    100(_lpoperator)\n    98(_lpadmin)\n    81(_appserveradm)\n    80(admin)\n    79(_appserverusr)\n    61(localaccounts)\n    12(everyone)\n    401(com.apple.access_screensharing)\n    402(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)\n\nNote that the gid=20(staff) on the newer account and the that user is a member of 20(staff). \nWhen you upgrade an older account to Lion, the older user and group names are kept.\nThere have been issues reported with not having staff group membership on upgraded accounts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inability to install or upgrade Homebrew;\n\n*The display of 'Fetching' when pressing Cmd+I on files in your user folder\n\n*ACL and permission issues.\n\n\nThe current workaround seems to be this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the user to staff (i.e.: $ sudo dscl . append /Groups/staff GroupMembership `whoami` or equivalent)\n\n*Use Lion Recovery to restore default home folder permissions (Click on the 'No Disc – Lion' tab). \n\n\nSo far, this has fixed a lot of the issues I had with the upgrade, and I seem to have longer battery life and lower CPU usage.\nHowever, here are the questions I have: \n1. Should I go through the trouble of changing the gid=501 to gid=20 on my account or is just being a member of the group staff good enough?\n2. Is being a member of 20(staff) the same as having gid=20(staff)?\n3. If I did change the gid= part of my account, how do I do that on Lion? I only know how to do it on Ubuntu...\n\nA: I haven't seen any difference in how OS X treats the primary group vs. a user's other groups, so I don't think it makes any real difference.  I'd be inclined to \"fix\" it for neatness, though.  These commands should set the primary group to 20, and then add a \"secondary\" membership in the old andrew group:\nsudo dscl . create /Users/andrew PrimaryGroupID 20\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -a andrew -t user andrew\n\n(Note: using dscl to add secondary group memberships doesn't quite do it right -- use dseditgroup instead.)\n\nA: I fear there is no easy answer on that:\n\n\n*\n\n*when accessing files it doesn't matter whether your gid is staff or you are just member of this group\n\n*when creating files it might matter because new files belong to you but get the group from the directory they are created in. But because the file is owned by you in this case you should be able to access it anyway\n\n\nFor most practical purposes belonging to the group is probably enough (especially as your problems seem to be resolved currently). \n", "Q: Working with subdirectories to classify apps on iTunes I have many apps on iTunes, some installed permanently onto the iPhone, some others not installed, and same thing for iPad. \nI'd like to separate them on the computer (Windows 7) to be able to make targetted backups. So I'd like to put them in some subdirs : \"iPhone/Permanent\", \"iphone/occasional\", \"iPad/permanent\", \"universal/occasional\", ...\nCan this be done without breaking iTunes ?\n\nA: That depends on what else you use iTunes for.  You can turn off the \"automatically sort iTunes content\" switch, which will allow you to spread files all over the shop, but be aware that fresh downloads, iphone purchase transfers, updates, and all sorts else may not honour your choice when doing updates and the like, resulting in potentially multiple versions of multiple apps in multiple locations, and also having potentially adverse affects on your other iTunes content such as music etc.\nI'm not sure about the Windows 7 aspect of this next bit, but on Mac you could \"label\" your files into categories, and then make a smart fodler that searches out for apps in location X (default) with Label Y etc - I think Windows must have some similar tagging system, certainly it can handle the saved searches/smart folder equivalent ably enough to approximate the same behaviour.\n\nA: Messing with iTunes' file system is generally a bad idea. I would also not worry about making targeted backups in the way that you describe, as you could just easily re-download the app from the App Store via iCloud. Backing up just the app wouldn't preserve any of your custom app data as well, so I don't think you need to worry about it.\nInstead, put your focus into making sure your device itself is backed up either via iTunes or the new iCloud backup system.\n", "Q: iPad workspaces Is there an app that allows one to create \"workspaces\" on the iPad?\nA workspace is essentially a particular set of open documents/windows that can be saved and reopened later.\nThis allows you to forget \"setting up\" by opening apps and loading documents every time, and makes the experience more task-oriented.  Workspaces could easily make working on the iPad 10 times more productive.\n\nA: In short, no.\nHowever, so long as you do not run the thing totally flat, and assuming that all apps you use are compiled to use the features available like auto-resume and saved states etc, there is no reason why once you have got the iPad into the configuration you like, it won;t stay that way untless you change it.  Opening Pages or iPod or Notes should always start where you left it.  But from a clean start, or to refresh your entire app status across multiple apps to a saved state is not possible as a single operation.\n", "Q: Can I have two apps running split screen on an iPad? Is there any way and have there been any examples of split-screening two apps on iPad so, for example, I can be scrolling through a PDF or PPT and simultaneously be typing notes about it in a text editor with an external keyboard?\n\nA: You'd have to have one app that does both the displaying and input, and I know of no apps like that.\nThere is no provision for split-screening apps, even iPhone apps. The best you'll be able to do is fast app switching.\n\nA: You can use iOS 9's Split View.\n\nWith Split View, you can open and use two apps at the same time. Open an app, then tap or drag the app divider to start using both apps. Slide down from the top of the screen to change the app on the right. If you want to close one of the apps, slide the divider over the app that you want to close.\n\n\nThis requires iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, or iPad mini 4. For more information, see:\n\n*\n\n*About Multitasking on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - Apple Support\n", "Q: iPad pop-up notetaking To serve the same basic purpose as my question about split-screen apps:\nIs there an app that allows me to quickly (in one touch or zero!) bring up a notepad/text editor while I'm in another app?\nThis would be immensely useful for things like taking notes on a PDF that I'm viewing.\n.\nI realize that certain apps may include note taking functionality, but these do not suit the need for a universal way of taking notes, which TextEdit on my Mac does nicely.\n\nA: You can easily get this by running any text editor (even Mail would do) in parallel to the main app and then use the new (iOS 5/iPad 2) four finger swipe (or a double-tab on the home button to get the list of applications) to switch between the app and the note. \n", "Q: Display a pixel-for-pixel copy of a Mac-created Keynote presentation on iPad Is there a way to get a pixel for pixel copy of a Mac-created Keynote presentation onto an iPad to present on an external display? The iOS Keynote app often has great trouble in importing Mac-Keynote documents (lacks 16x9 resolution, fonts, etc). I don't want to convert the presentation to a PDF, as this removes animations/videos/etc. Converting to a Quicktime file also does not work, as there isn't any way to manually advance a Quicktime \"slide\" on the iPad. \nIt's quite probable that there is no solution, but I'm eager to hear suggestions I may have overlooked.\n\nA: Staying with the keynote format, no. I you export to a QuickTime movie, you will have the best chance to preserve the slide deck as it was on the Mac when saving it alone doesn't work. \nYou can only work around this by getting the mac pixels on the iPad since this appears to be an inherent limitation of the iOS app as written today.\nHave you tried using Air Display to add the iPad as a second monitor and tell Keynote to present on the iPad? The company does awesome work and like any screen sharing over a network, there is latency and/or slight rendering artifacts, but it's better than other apps in that space as any I've seen.\n\nA: As someone who gives as many as 40 or 50 presentations annually, this is a conundrum I seriously contemplate with every Keynote file I create. I don't know if I have achieved \"pixel-to-pixel\" fidelity between my devices, but I strive to build \"to the presentation device\" to minimize the amount of post-transfer repairing required. Historically, I created most of my Keynote presentations on a variety of desktop and laptop Macs. I have built a few on iPads (version 1, 3 and 4) as well as iPhone (4/4s/5). \nThe best advice I can give: The presentation device is not always the gadget running the file. More often than not, it's a projector. In your case, the presentation device will be the external monitor. from here on out, we'll call the \"presentation device\" the screen and the computer or iPad you run the file on the device.\nIn almost all situations, the organizations where I present provide the projector. To date, all the projectors have been square-format (1024x768 or 1280x1024), not 16x9 or 16x10 as with most current desktop and laptop screens.\nWhen I create a presentation, I try build it (or refine a version of it) for the screen it will display on as well as the device that runs it:\n\n\n*\n\n*A projector provided by the organization (read as \"usually cheap\" or abused). Lowest-common-denominator 1024x768 comes to mind.\n\n*An organization I have previously presented to, capable of 1280x1024. The bulk of my \"presentations\" fall into this category.\n\n*A \"kiosk\" presentation to display on a specific device, be it an iphone 4s or 5, an iPad 4, iPad 2, a 27\" iMac, or a 17\" MacBook Pro.\n\n*An external monitor of either known or unknown dimensions or resolution.\n\n\nCanderson, your situations looks closest to 2, 3 or 4 above. To the best of your ability, I would apply these constraints:\n\n\n*\n\n*give yourself enough time for a trial run on the screen as well as time to enact any corrections or final polishing the translated presentation needs to look the way you want while running on the device.\n\n*if at all possible, provide your own screen where you know not only the resolution, but also the color fidelity, brightness, etc. \n\n*when working with an unknown screen, 1024x768 is safest, but 1280x1024 can look better if the screen will support it\n\n*set the slide resolution to the hardware resolution of the screen (monitor or projector), rather than an arbitrary or default resolution\n\n*most of the problems I encounter when moving or transferring a presentation from a computer to iPad stem from Keynote's default resizing algorithms\n\n*use only fonts available on the device\n\n*use only transitions available or appropriate on the device\n\n*use only image files available (or appropriate) on the device\n\n*\n\n*for transparent backgrounds, Keynote on OS X can read Photoshop files, but iOS does not support the format--use PNG instead\n\n*OS X allow PDFs in a Keynote file, but it doesn't work so well for iOS\n\n\n*build your image files to the number of pixels (not just a generic resolution) they will appear on screen... if you need to think in dpi:\n\n*\n\n*start somewhere around 72dpi for laptops, desktops or \"low res\" iOS gadgets\n\n*144dpi for iPad 3+ or iPhone 4+, or retina MacBook Pro \n\n\n*if your screen is 2048x1537, and you want a graphic to occupy about half the screen, that image needs to be 1024x768 regardless of dpi\nI experienced intermittent crashes with iOS Keynote on the iPad 1 and 2. The iPad 3 and 4, especially with the current version of Keynote on iOS 6 have \n - been more stable\n - been able to Magic Move with larger jpgs or pngs\n - included more transitions\n - been more reliable\nI'm not a podium speaker--I feel like a caged tiger when I can't prowl around the room. My next goal is to AirPlay my presentation wirelessly to an AppleTV hooked to the projector, either through a local wifi network or using my iPhone as the router. The iPad VGA adapter works well if you have the iPad stationary. Unfortunately the connection has fallen apart on my as I move around. Rubber bands just aren't that professional looking.\nGood luck with your presentation!\n\nA: Use iWork.com embedding  :)\nSince January (Keynote 5.0.5), iWork lets you embed your published presentation and play them in Safari (link contains a demo). Follow the instructions there!\nNote that not all transitions will be available, so it won't be a “pixel-for-pixel” in all cases, but I guess it's the best alternative we can get.\nNote: I have not tested this with an iPad (don't have any around), but seeing all that's required is a recent version of Safari, that should work.\n", "Q: How does iOS 5 decide what mailbox to watch for new mail? I have a new iPhone 4 (not S).  I have installed iOS 5 on it.  I have configured an Exchange active-sync mailbox for my mail.\nI have three Exchange rules running on incoming messages in order to sort them into three places:\n\n\n*\n\n*filter out all low-importance messages to folder B\n\n*filter out messages that are not to me to folder B\n\n*filter out messages which are to me but I don't want to get notified-on-arrival to folder A\n\n\nThis theoretically leaves messages in my Inbox which are both to me and something I want to be notified about when they arrive.  If I want to look at mail in folder A, it is a few clicks and a poll away, which I can live with.\nSo when mail is filtered into folder B, great, it works.\nWhen mail arrives and ends up in the Inbox, the phone vibrates and goes \"Bing!\"  Also great.\nHowever.  When mail is filtered into folder A, there appear to be some circumstances where the iPhone will notify me that new mail has arrived by vibrating and going \"bing!\", while other times it works the way I want.\nSo my question is: why is the phone sometimes alerting me that mail has arrived in folder A?\n\nUpdate: one thing that I maybe should have mentioned is that I'm filtering with exceptions in my rules:\nRule 1:\nCriteria:\n    Stuff marked low priority\nAction:\n    move to Inbox-Filtered-Out\n    stop processing rules on this message\nRule 2:\nCriteria:\n    stuff marked normal priority\nAction:\n    move to Inbox-Filtered-Out\n    stop processing rules on this message\nExcept:\n    if it is to: or cc: me\n    or if it is from (list of people which includes my wife and the pager-relayer)\n    or if it is to (specific address which I am responsible for responding to)\nRule 3:\nCriteria:\n    stuff marked normal priority\nAction:\n    move to Inbox-For-Me\n    stop processing rules on this message\nExcept:\n    if it is from my wife or the pager-relayer\n    or if it is to (specific address which I am responsible for responding to)\n\nSo after all that, the only things left in my Inbox (and therefore triggers the phone alerting me to its arrival) should be stuff from my wife, or something that I need to be alerted on (or is marked as High priority). The rest of the moderately important stuff ends up in Inbox-For-Me, and everything else is shunted to Inbox-Filtered-Out.\nI should also mention that these three rules are the only rules I have on the Exchange account, so I'm pretty sure there isn't a race condition here.\n\nA: I don't know that this is defined anywhere, but it has been my observation that you will be notified about new mail in the folder you are browsing in the mail client and in the inbox but no other folders.  So if you're reading messages in folder B and then put the phone sleep or switch to another app, you will be notified about new messages in the inbox and new messages in folder B but not new messages in folder A.  If you are reading messages in the inbox, then you won't be notified about messages in any other folder.\n\nA: OK, after some playing around, this is what I think is happening.\nAssume I have three folders as defined above: A, B, and Inbox.  Then ignore folder B for now.\nIf I am looking at my Inbox when a new message comes in, everything works as I expect.\nNow assume that I either have folder A open, or the last folder I had open was A and I am at the folder list screen.  When in that state (or if that is the last state I left the email client in before pressing Lock or Home), then the iPhone alerts on messages being delivered to folder A.\nI'm probably explaining this really badly.\n", "Q: Can I add an entry to Dictionary? Is it possible to add an entry to the bundled Japanese-English dictionary?\nI'm using Dictionary version 2.2 (155) on OS X Lion.\n\nA: No: the dictionary files OS X’ Dictionary app uses are read-only, and Dictionary.app does not support annotations. You can create new dictionaries (though that is not a trivial task), but not modify the existing ones.\n", "Q: Podcast cover art missing since upgrading to iOS 5 Since upgrading my iPhone 3GS to iOS 5 some of my podcasts no longer display their custom cover art.

The cover art displays correctly in iTunes itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get the missing cover art back on my iPhone?\n\n\nA: I was able to fix this myself in the end by deleting the podcasts on the iPhone itself and then re-syncing. Sometimes it took several attempts before the cover art came back.\n", "Q: Any application that can split scanned PDF's on an iPad? Are there any iPad PDF apps that either automatically or manually can split scanned PDF's into multiple pages? \nAt school, I receive many scanned PDFs that have 2 physical pages per PDF page, which makes them more cumbersome to work with since it requires me to manually pan around to see the next page.\n\nA: PDFPen for iPad\nhas recently been released. It will permit you to split PDFs by saving a new copy of the PDF and then deleting pages you don't want.\n\nA: I've not come across anything that will alter PDF's like that, however Goodreader (and Goodreader for iPad) is in my opinion the best PDF reader app\nIt has quite a few reading modes and easier pan and zoom controls (multitouch gestures) that may provide a better reading experience than using the iPad's built in viewer.\nThe downside is it is a commercial program, but at $5, it is money well spent.\nGoodReader for iPad\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to move a window from one monitor to another? Is there a free app that I can use to move a window from one monitor to the other monitor (assuming only two monitors) via the keyboard? I shouldn't have to use the mouse at all (e.g., for selecting the window or the monitor, or for dragging).\nI know this can be done in Linux using compiz; I'm surprised there isn't a (free) option for OS X.\n\nA: BetterSnapTool also has this feature (as a shortcut). I think it was a free app, and its been a great one.\nThere is a shortcut where you can maximize the window in the next screen (among other shortcuts or ways of doing this). See the screenshot of the related shortcuts.\n\n\nA: I ended up using BetterTouchTool to do this. Overall I found it to be the most configurable. Here is a screenshot of my configuration, whereas Cmd+Ctrl+W moves a window to the next monitor.\nIf you have a 3 monitor setup (2 external monitors and the Mac monitor), you can set up the \"Move Window to Next Monitor\" to the right by doing the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*set up a new shortcut, specify \"Move Window to Next Monitor\" as the Predefined Action\n\n*click Attach Additional Action and again specify \"Move Window to Next Monitor\" as the action \n\n*Voila, you can now move a window to the monitor on the right (a little hacky I know, but it works until the developer of BTT updates the app)\n\n\n\nThe only shortcoming of BetterTouchTool is poor Lion support (not all features are available) but it is available as an alpha release.

To get the screen names, you'll need to move applications to each screen and see what the menu item changes to and then create a shortcut for that screen.\nWhen I first did this, the shortcut didn't work.

I have a 1TB external hard disk from Seagate connected to the USB port of my Airport Extreme and everytime I need to access it I have to wait some time until it leaves the sleep mode. \nIs there a way to prevent it from happening?\n\nA: You can run Keep Drive Spinning on a Mac that's connected to your drive over the network. It continuously accesses a hidden file to keep the drive awake.\nYou can also set it up yourself per these instructions.\n\nA: If the computers on your network are Windows PCs, then you can map the shared network drive on one of your Windows boxes, then install NoSleep HD 2.0.  Run the program, add that drive as the one to keep awake, and you are ready to go.\n", "Q: How can I make Find My Friends display distance in miles rather than km? I'm in the UK, where (like the US) we use miles to measure distance, not kilometres. However, on both my iPhone and iPad the Find My Friends app in iOS 5 shows distances in km.\nIf I go to Settings > General > International and change my Region Format setting to United States, Find My Friends automatically switches to displaying distance in miles. Switch back to United Kingdom and frustratingly I'm back to km. Is there any other way to make Find My Friends pick up the correct unit for UK users?\n\nA: No. The app doesn't currently have an override and simply takes the distance units from the system settings. \nIt surely would be nice to have finer control, but the code isn't there to make a change today. \n\nA: Select 'friends' and \ntap on grey inverted horseshoe 'Me' at bottom and scroll to the bottom of the resulting screen and there you can select your distance preference.\n", "Q: Internet download manager alternative for OS X?

For some time it has been possible to configure iChat accounts so that iChat messages sent when one is offline are forwarded to a mobile number. This conveniently allows iChat-to-moble conversations.\nHas the deployment if iMessage changed any of this functionality?\n\nA: No, iMessages has not changed any of these features. Forwarding to a cell phone is a feature that is handled via AIM rather than iChat.\nFurthermore, the new Messages application has not changed any of this functionality either. It works exactly as it did before. It shows a little \"wi-fi\" symbol next to buddies that are offline, but have AIM Forwarding enabled. However, this symbol is only visible in the Buddies window, and not in the Messages window (the window where you chat). They appear like any other offline user in the Messages window. Therefore, it might help if you remember who does and who doesn't have this feature enabled.\nWhen you send them a message, it goes to their cell phone, and when they reply, you see it in Messages. Note that if they are on invisible mode on AIM, it goes to their AIM rather than their cell phone. This provides further evidence that AIM is in charge of forwarding to the phone rather than iChat/Messages.\n", "Q: How can I keep apps \"always on top\" in Lion?

Some fonts that appear in Font Book are True Type fonts. For those that are not, the question is about converting that specific format.\nTo find the file for a particular font, select it in Font Book, control-click it, and select \"Show in Finder\".

I have git on /usr/bin/git (I think was Xcode install) but it is 1.7.5.4 and I want to use the current version 1.7.7\nIs there a way to uninstall that version and use the new one?\n\nA: You can install git from source using Homebrew, and just point your PATH to use the new one instead of the xcode/system version.\nThere's a little video tutorial here. http://vimeo.com/14649488\nIt's for an older version but it will get you started, let me know if you need more info.\n(You can also use MacPorts, Fink or the Git OS X installer, to upgrade.)\n\nA: If you want to use git itself to update git run the following commands :\nThis can be run from anywhere git clone git://github.com/gitster/git.git\nthen you want to cd git then run this sudo make prefix=/usr install install-doc install-html install-info\nThis will install Git into your /usr/bin folder for global use.\n\nA: None of the current answers will upgrade Xcode git. They will only install a newer version of git.\nXcode has changed its mind several times about the best git location. Depending on how long ago you have been installing Xcode you will see git binaries at:\n/usr/bin/git\n/usr/local/git\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/libexec/git-core/git\n\nEven if you update the PATH, Xcode will stick to its version. The only way I know to force it to use the newer version is replacing those git binaries by a link to the new one you installed.\nln -s /opt/local/bin/git /usr/bin/git\n\nRepeat for the other path. Notice I use a symbolic link, not a hard one. Otherwise Xcode would replace your other installation during an upgrade\n\nA: If you want a newer git than the one in Xcode then you need to install it, this install should be to another place as if you update /usr/bin/git then an Apple update will overwrite this version.\nThere are several ways to do this but as noted by @FranciscoGarcia they won't necessarily change the one used by Xcode just the command line version.\nThe easiest is to install the binaries from the git site. \nIf you want code then use a package manager e.g. Fink macports, Homebrew.\nIf you want the bleeding edge latest install from git's own repository.\n\nA: You can install the latest git using macports:\nsudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb\n\n\nA: Download the latest binary from here and install.\n", "Q: How can I change the Apple ID associated with an iPod Touch? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnable to change Apple ID on my iPhone \n\nI just bought myself a used iPod Touch - 2nd generation.

I've checked into the different settings but I couldn't find anything on it.\n\nA: You might find this answer to be helpful for changing the Apple ID on your phone.\nTo summarize, go to Settings » Store » click on the old Apple ID » Sign out » Sign in and enter your own Apple ID.\n", "Q: Enable AirPrint with a router? Excuse me for being completely confused about how AirPrint works.  I'm aware of AirPrint activator on a PC.  But is there a way to use a generic router (or Airport base station/Time Capsule) to attach an HP ethernet Laserjet printer to AirPrint?\n\nA: Apple routers generally have no viable software you can customize. Other generic and third party routers often can be flashed and updates. It might be possible to get this working on routers that are able to run pared down versions of Linux (such as DD-WRT or Tomato) in place of their stock firmware. Linux can do AirPrint sharing of standard printers with a combination of CUPS and avahi (Bonjour) following instructions you can find here. Some of the 3rd party router firmwares already have CUPS configured, and I suspect you could get avahi working on them as well, there may be a pre-built version, but you may have to compile yourself. \nBottom line, given a compatible router, you should be able to do it, but it will require a fair bit of hacking and googling. There's no turn-key solution that I'm aware of, and of course this only works with routers that can use 3rd party firmware (there's a pretty good selection, but definitely not all), and Apple base stations definitely won't work unless Apple itself adds the functionality.\n\nA: You'll need a TomatoUSB compatible router with at least one USB port, which you can pick up for as low as $24 dollars on Amazon.\nLike another user pointed out, TomatoUSB is a opensource router firmware that is based on Linux. The solution involves installing CUPS, Avahi, Dbus and other software to complete the printing chain.\nBelow is a tutorial I just wrote on how to setup AirPrint on a TomatoUSB router.\nKeep in mind this isn't bulletproof and fully tested, but it works. Please comment and provide feedback if you try it (working or not working).\n[Tutorial] Apple AirPrint on TomatoUSB Router\nhttp://blog.qnology.com/2013/03/tutorial-apple-airprint-on-tomatousb.html\nAs an added bonus, you can even set it up to do Google CloudPrint (some bugs still needs to be worked out). CloudPrint will allow you to print from any computer using Chrome over the internet (it also works with the iPhone Chrome app). You can even share the printer, so your friends and family can use it. Maybe set it up for the grandparents (along with a photo printer) so you can magically send them prints of the grandkids?\nAs mentioned by another user, the PogoPlug (E02) \"hacked\" to run ArchLinux ARM (ARLARM) is another great solution. Personally this is the solution I use. The PogoPlug can be bought for around $20 and is way more powerful in terms of CPU power than any router. Sorry at this time I don't have instructions for setting up AirPrint on the PogoPlug. However, I do plan on writing a tutorial in the near future and will update this answer when its available.\n[Edit] - Tutorial for setting up AirPrint and AirPlay on PogoPlug (Recommended Solution)\n\nA: There's a new product being demoed at CES that you can connect to any printer and make it AirPrint enabled... Maybe it would suit your needs?\n\nA: You can do it with a Pogoplug (v2) running arch Linux arm. They even have a (poorly written) tutorial. I can confirm that it is possible to get AirPrint working. As a bonus, AirPlay also works with added USB sound card. Not bad for $25\n", "Q: How can I use my Apple bluetooth keyboard for keyboard navigation on my iPad? I'm using an Apple bluetooth keyboard with my iPad. Even in Safari, arrow keys, Cmd-arrow for forward and back, Cmd-D for bookmark, etc do not work.  The only useful keyboard navigation is Return, Tab and Shift-Tab.\nAre there perhaps some jailbroken apps that provide some sort of keyboard navigation shim?  Perhaps through GUI macros?\n\nA: I am sorry to say that I am unaware of any apps (jailbroken or otherwise) that add keyboard navigation to the iPad.\nAccording to GigaOm, the following shortcuts do work:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘C Copy selected text\n\n*⌘X Cut selected text\n\n*⌘V Paste\n\n*⌘Z Undo\n\n*⌘shiftZ Redo\n\n*⌘↑ Go to top of document\n\n*⌘↓ Go to bottom of document\n\n*⌘← Go to start of line\n\n*⌘→ Go to end of line\n\n*⌘⌫ Delete to end of line\n\n*⌥⌫ Delete previous word\n\n*F1 Make screen dimmer\n\n*F2 Make screen brighter\n\n*F7 Skip back one song\n\n*F8 Play or Pause Music\n\n*F9 Skip forward one song\n\n*F10 Mute Volume\n\n*F11 Decrease Volume\n\n*F12 Increase Volume \n\n*⏏ Show or hide onscreen keyboard\n\n\nA: There is a nice article on enabling some keyboard features using VoiceOver. It is not perfect, especially due to the fact that it disables normal typing and scrolling with fingers, but it allows you to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select items with keyboard (Left & Right buttons)\n\n*Open Home Screen (Ctrl+Opt+H) and running applications (double that shortcut)\n\n*Quick Search on current screen (Ctrl+Opt+I)\n\n*and more.\n\n\nI wish I could enable these shortcuts without switching on the whole VoiceOver feature. \n", "Q: Replace dead keys of default US keyboard layout on Lion? I've been trying to create a new keyboard layout using Ukelele on Lion. I want to replace some dead keys combination like option+e to option+'.\nUkelele seems to be the right tool for it. Problem is, since Lion, it doesn't support the \"New from Current Input Source\" option, which means I can't seem to simply edit the \"US\" layout to replace the dead keys I want.\nIs there an already working keylayout that works on Lion and replaces the option+letter combinations with option+accent?\nIs there another solution for this problem?\nWhere can I find the original Lion keylayouts? I've tried using old keylayouts (or automatically generated ones), but then a lot of subtle things breaking (like text selection on textmate).\n\nA: New version of Ukelele supports \"New from Current Input Source\" on Lion. Managed to create a keylayout that solves my problem. Downoad it here: US AltGr.keylayout\n\nA: If your goal is to emulate the US International layout found on PC's, where you type the accent mark and then the base letter, you can use the US International - PC layout provided with Lion.\nI've made a lot of layouts with Ukelele and I think there are always some of those subtle things that can break, luckily none that matter for me.  You might write the author of the app about your particular problems.\nThere is no way to access the Lion system layouts for modification as far as I know.\n", "Q: iPhone Medical app that retains information through an upgrade Is there a medical application for the iphone where you do not lose all info entered when getting an upgraded iphone?  I did not realize I would lose all the information I entered.\n\nA: Most iOS apps will transfer data to a new iOS device if the old device with the app data is Sync'd and backed-up to iTunes on a Mac or PC, and the new device is then restored from the backup of that old device on the same Mac or PC.\nYou might want to make a backup of your iTunes backups to be more safe.\nIf you don't want to restore from backup, but set up a device as new (blank), the you may need to find a medical web app where your info is stored online somewhere.\nIn the future, there may be some iCloud enabled apps (assuming they can somehow meet HIPPA requirements with your private medical info).\n\nA: This answers your question, but the question is extremly unclear:\nhttps://www.quentiq.com/content/\n", "Q: Is the feed that comes from Apple's RSS feed generator out of sync with the app store? For example...\nhttp://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStoreServices.woa/ws/RSS/toppaidapplications/limit=25/xml\nRight now, for me, that feed shows Camera+ as being the number 3 app paid app. However, on the iphone app store at this moment, Camera+ is number 4 and Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots is number 3. In the feed Puss in Boots is like 8 or 9.\nThe timestamp on items in the feed appears old. I thought maybe it was some sort of caching issue on my end, maybe it is, but I've tried running this from a clear browser.\nAlso if I go to http://feeds.appstorefeeds.com/appstorefeeds-TopPaidiPhoneApps it shows Camera+ as being number 3. Still caching maybe? I don't know. Anyone have any insights?\n\nA: The \"appstorefeeds.com\" website is not associated with Apple. That appears to be a third-party site that creates its own feeds. My best guess is that it creates these feeds by scraping Apple's own feeds periodically. This type of operation is not something that can guarantee that all updates to Apple's own feeds will be updated live to \"appstorefeeds.com\". \nNot even within Apple's own website infrastructure you get that type of live syncing. I have seen Apple's website out of sync with what is displayed in the charts within iTunes. If you want the closest to the latest information, you should probably check from within iTunes. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: iPad photo blogging recommendation Simple question:\nWhat is the simplest, most minimal app for both creating/managing blogs and posting photos from the built-in camera?\n\nA: I don't know what the simplest is, as I cannot claim to have used them all, but I can suggest using a Tumblr blog with the Tumblr iOS client (or one of the various other Tumblr compatible ones), as it's pretty straightforward at both the web and iPad client end.\n\nA: Posterous might be the easiest solution.\nThey have a proper app and stuff, but afaik you can control it mostly through email. So setting up a blog requires you to email post@posterous.com with your first email. That'll get posts up online. To add more posts, you just keep emailing them there. To be fair, to manage stuff, you do need to visit the website (or use the app - never tried it myself.) But in terms of actually updating, emailing photos and text is something that the iPad and iPhone do very well. \n", "Q: Is the iOS 5 beta no longer usable? I've been using iOS5 beta 7 for a while.  About 4 hours ago (possibly the end of the 20th, PST, the expiration date for iOS 5 beta 7) the phone locked itself and claims it requires activation.  Whenever I try, it claims the activation server is temporarily unavailable.\nShould I sit tight and wait, or is there something else I can do, such as wipe iOS5 and reinstall from a release image?\n\nA: You'll have to upgrade to the release version, not much else you can do about it.\n\nA: if your iPhone refuses to being updated to iOS 5.0, maybe you should put it in DFU (Device Firmware Update mode). To do that, follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPhone to your Mac/PC;   \n\n*Hold the power button for 2 seconds;\n\n*Without releasing the power button, hold the home button for 10 seconds\n\n*Release the power button and keep holding the home button until your iPhone appears in iTunes;\n\n*Proceed with software restore; you might restore your software backup at the end of the procedure.\n\n\nA: The only beta still usable is the GM.

As much as I like multitasking gestures , they are creating problems in certain games where we use multiple fingers like Fruit Ninja , can these be disabled for specific apps/games on my iPad 2?\n\nA: Currently and without jailbreak no and I doubt Apple will ever introduce this option as it would be only useful to a few people. It's all or nothing.\n\nA: At the risk of a repeat \"no\" answer, I would like say add to the two existing replies and clarify that that I have never come across any setting that has been anything other than system wide, it's either on, or it is off, whether it's silent mode for everyone bar your mom, or send read replies to everyone except your dad etc.  It's just how it works, and it's a conscious decision to enable consistency and ease of use more than a limitation.\n\nA: unfortunately, no, at least with the official software. \n", "Q: Activation fails on iPad running iOS Beta 7 This morning my iPad wanted to activate itself once more and at some point I receive the following message:\n\nWe're unable to complete your activation on my iPad\nThis device is not registered as part of the iPhone Developer Program.

In Lion, being able to swipe between desktops with the trackpad is great. However since adding another monitor to my setup, what I really want to be able to do is swipe desktops across monitors. E.g. if I have the following setup:\nDesktop 1 | Desktop 2 | XCode | Chrome\n\nInstead of swiping left from Desktop 1 replacing the contents of both screens, Desktop 1 is displayed on the left hand monitor and Desktop 2 on the right. Swiping left moves Desktop 2 to the left hand monitor, and full screen Xcode to the right hand monitor. This would be especially useful as XCode/Chrome etc. just blank out the second monitor when in fullscreen mode, which is really annoying!\nIs there an app or setting that can achieve this?\n\nA: This is not possible, the multi monitor support on Lion is ridiculously lacking, especially given Apple jumping up and down about how amazing Thunderbolts (and the displays) are.\nIf you want to use more than one screen, you are pretty much unable to use FullScreen. (without making the secondary screen useless)\n\nA: Have a look at the Better Touch Tool. I think it can not exactly do what you want, but you can define gestures, that let you move a window from one screen on an other.\n\nA: Just maximize the two applications you want, and put both apps into their own screen within the same space. Yeah, it's not \"full screen\" but it's virtually the same idea and lets you swipe through panes of apps, and lets you use both screens at once. \n", "Q: How to explicitly password-lock an iPhone regardless of timeout setting? Can I explicitly lock the iPhone, so that it needs a passphrase to unlock?\nI want to instantly lock the iPhone and not be waiting until \"Require Passcode\" (currently at 1 hour) kicks in. \nBasically I want the iPhone to automatically lock after an hour, but if I want to lock right now, to do that easily.\n\nA: You cannot explicitly lock the iPhone. The closest you could come is manually turn on the passcode each time you want to lock it, but obviously that's a bit of a pain. There may be a jailbroken app that does this, but on a standard iOS install, locking is solely based on the timeout with no way to explicitly lock the device.\n\nA: On IOS 13, with the iPhone X and later, this is easy -\n\n*\n\n*press and hold the VOLUME DOWN and the POWER buttons simultaneously for two seconds\n\nYou will feel the phone vibrate momentarily (this is true even if you have system haptics turned off), and then be presented with the SOS screen.\nEven if you now press Cancel, your phone will require require your passcode before re-enabling face ID.\n\nA: It's not exactly convenient, but if you have Require Password set for one hour, but power off the iPhone then power it back on, it will require your password even if you've entered it in the last hour.\n\nA: Probably not exactly what you're looking for, but worth knowing anyway. If you log into iCloud, you can go to \"Find my iPhone\", then after the phone is located, you can click the info icon and you have the option to lock your phone (provided you've turned on Find my iPhone and it's connected to the internet).\n\nA: There is one way to do this: Restart your phone by holding down Home and Power for several seconds. This will lock the phone (and if you are using TouchID it will require a passcode instead of your fingerprint). \n(This is slightly different and faster than the previous answer of powering off and on the iPhone.)\nThe previously-mentioned method of using Find iPhone also works; enter Lost mode. \nNeither of these solutions is ideal, of course, but they seem to be the only ones available other than entering Settings and temporarily changing the Lock time. \n\nA: There are 2 types of locking mechanism (certainly in iOS 5 and iOS 4.2.1).\nFirstly, in Settings > General there is Auto-Lock, with settings of 1-5 minutes, or Never.\nSecondly, same place, there is Passcode Lock, which if set has options of Immediately, after 1, 5, 15 minutes, or 1, 4 hours.\nThe first of these locks your screen after a period of inactivity (for the purposes of saving battery hence the max of 5 minutes), but the second refers to the amount of time that must pass after the screen it locked before the passcode is required to unlock (for the purpose of security).\nA common mistake it to confuse the two, and the wonder why it does (or doesn't) ask for your passcode each time.  You might have the auto-lock set to 5 minutes, thinking it is the correct setting, leaving the passcode lock to immediate which is the default.  This is why you might need to re-enter your pin even if you try it only seconds after locking when you think it's set to 5 minutes.\nTo go back to the original question, without your passcode lock being set to immediate, there is no way to immediately lock your phone without waiting for whatever setting you have got instead.  It would be nice if something like a double tap on the power button when locking did it, or if holding it down to get the slide to power off screen also had a slide to lock now section, and I may well head over to Apple feedback now to suggest same, but to answer the OP question directly and finally, the answer is no.\n\nA: Sounds like you have different carriers, however the answer about there being 2 different \"locks\" is correct.  \nYou can set \"auto-lock\" and you can set \"password lock\"\nI've set password lock and given it a password.  And then I explicitly push the power button once quickly to make the iphone sleep.  It immediately goes to sleep and when I push the power button once quickly it wakes up but is password locked; and of course the power was \"off\" (battery savings) without actually holding the button down and turning the device off...\n\nA: Use iCloud to send a remote lock to your device. Here is an article explaining how this is done using Apple's push notification service.\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud: Lock and track your device\n\nA: If you have an iPhone 5S or later, with fingerprint security - Touch ID - it is always locked immediately after 'sleeping' - with no way to bypass or change the feature, other than by disabling Touch ID again.\nAs the Touch ID method of opening the phone is faster than any swipe/numeric entry, this is actually no disadvantage whatsoever.\n\nA: So you can do this if you don't use news stand (which I don't). Put news stand into a folder. After doing this, every time you try to launch news stand, springboard will restart. This prompts you for your password. \nI do this all the time when my phone is unlocked but I want to hand it to someone to take a photo (since you can get to the camera from the lock screen now)\nLooks like 5.1 fixed this bug with news stand but I did this before 5.1 and when I upgraded it didnt move it out of the folder so this still works for me. \n\nA: if you mean lock so that it requires the screen to enter the 4-digit passcode,\nyou just tap the power button (the button on top edge) quickly once.\nThen, it locks\n\nA: Just hold down the top power button for a second and it will go in standby mode and lock your phone immediately.\n", "Q: Is Mac OS X required to submit an app to the iOS App Store? We are about to develop an application using Phonegap, a cross platform mobile development tool, but they offer a service where they will build your applications and send you the compiled source code. \nCan I submit the compiled source code to the App Store on a Windows-based PC?\n\nA: No, the compiled code must be submitted via a Mac. One \"workaround\" is to install OS X into a virtual machine on Windows, but that violates the OS X user agreement. So yes, you'll need a Mac.\n", "Q: Is the Lion USB drive purchased from Apple bootable? I am helping my in-laws install Lion this weekend. They have purchased the Lion USB upgrade, but are only running Tiger on their Mac. Is the Lion USB bootable so I can do a clean install rather than upgrading their OS?\n\nA: Yes. You can boot from the USB drive. This means you can avoid having to get 10.6.8 and the Mac App store to download the Lion installer but can instead boot from USB and erase the drive and perform a bare install.\nThings to remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion does not ship with iLife so consider pricing that or checking if older versions of the suite will work as desired.\n\n*Lion may not import settings from older backups as well as it does in Snow Leopard, but it's easy to try and erase and start over if problems arise.\n\n*You can always hand copy files and folders or make a bootable clone of the old system just in case you will want to boot the mac in the old OS to export some data you didn't know needed moving (old tax programs, etc...)\n\n\nA: Yes, technically Lion is an upgrade from Snow Leopard, from a licensing perspective, but frankly there are no technical limitations and you can happily full-install it on a fresh drive, or even on a drive that used to have XP on it, it doesn't care in operation, and will happily allow you to use disk utility to prepare any old partition (within reason, bearing in mind that it also installed a recovery partition which can cause issues if you have more than 3 existing partitions) for install without caring what else is kicking around.\n\nA: Yes, the Lion flash drive from Apple will boot Macs capable of running Lion.\nOr, had you not bought the Apple flash drive you could upgrade a single machine via the web download but before running the installer, use that disk image to create your own Lion flash drive:\nhttp://www.richardsnotes.org/archives/2011/08/13/lion-on-a-stick/\nI upgraded my wife's MacBook Pro with the flash drive I made from the download I bought for my computer. And, I now have a \"stick\" that will boot our Macs and any new Mac I buy. I also saved the original disk image on a backup hard disk so I can use it to make another \"stick\" if god forbid I misplace the one I made.\n", "Q: How to backup a Mac running Tiger? I need to do a full backup of a Mac running Tiger. If I use Time Machine will it capture everything I need to restore a user's data after a clean install of Lion? Are there other better mechanisms I can use to perform the backup?\n\nA: You have two main options. Depending on what you want exactly and how much of your current user information/settings you want to migrate. \nManually\nThis is the method I prefer. i believe that when doing a clean install the point is to get rid of all the extra junk that is just sitting on your computer. To do this you need to manually backup your stuff data. Just go through all your folders and copy the stuff to an external HD. (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Movies, Music, Pictures, Public, Sites, Bookmarks, Adress Book, Mail, etc). \nYou leave all your settings/preferences behind. This makes for a real clean install. \nUsing backup utility\nI would suggest using CarbonCopyCloner. It's free and works on Tiger. With this clone your current hard drive and after doing a clean install Lion will ask you if you want to import your stuff from a previous installation and you can select the clone you just made. Keep in mind that this will also copy back all the preferences/settings and junk you might have accumulated. Thus in my perspective defeating the point of a clean install.\nCombination\nThis is probably the best option. Make a clone with CCC and then instead of having Lion automatically bring back your data, do it yourself manually. This way you will have everything saved from the clone and you will be able to bring back only the important data you want and not any overhead.\n\nA: Do you need to do incremental backups, or just make one perfect backup, such as for transferring to a new machine?\nIf you just need to do the full backup, you can use CarbonCopyCloner. That will make a full byte for byte backup (that's even bootable) onto another machine. You can then copy over user files (such as Music, Movies, etc) to the new machine once the upgrade to Lion is complete.\nNow, normally I'd suggest using Apple's Migration Wizard, the built in tool to transfer files to a new install. But since you have Tiger, the migration wizard will not work. So your best bet is to copy over files manually. You may want to only copy over user document folders (Music, Movies, etc) and not Applications and ~/Library as it's likely you'll run into some issues going from Tiger to Lion. Install fresh apps, copy user data, and recreate everything else.\n\nA: Time Machine was not introduced until Leopard, so you will not be able to take a Time Machine backup of it, unless you were able to somehow connect the drive to another Leopard-or-newer Mac and back it up that way.  Perhaps by Firewire target mode, depending on what you have access to.  I cannot say what is best to use as I never owned Tiger for more than a few weeks, but TM is out of the question unless you fudge it somehow.\n\nA: An alternative to Carbon Copy Cloner is SuperDuper! I used CCC for years but moved to SuperDuper! for its ease of use and cleaner design.\nhttp://shirtpocket.com/\nThe idea of having a bootable copy of your computer, updated daily (SD does smart backups) is important. If anything happens to my computer I can either boot any Intel Mac (I use GUID partitioning) from my backup or get another computer, start up from my backup, run SuperDuper!, erase the new hard disk and copy the backup over to it.\nWhile I do use Time Machine I still find SuperDuper! the better backup tool and it takes about 15 minutes to copy my 500GB SSD to a 500GB 7200 RPM rugged drive with firewire 800. I do it daily while cooking dinner. Easy.\nOh, and because we heat our house with wood and so run a higher risk than many of a house fire, I have two backup drives, one in a fireproof case in the basement, one in my desk. I swap them daily. I've been backing up like this for over 10 years with CCC or SD.\n", "Q: Where is iDVD on Lion? At school we heavily rely on using iDVD for our video projects. Upon receiving our 2011 iMac's preloaded with OS X Lion, we found it doesn't seem to exist anymore. Videos have been edited in iMovie, and there is the option to Share > iDVD, but once the video renders nothing happens. \nIs it possible to download iDVD still? If not, what are the other options?\n\nA: iDVD is only available through physycal media copies of the latest iLife package.  Preloaded iLife suites no longer include it, and I do not believe you can download it, either from Apple or as a paid product via the Mac App Store.  But if you have the media from an old machine, you should be able to install it happily enough though, it's not changed since iLife '08, so almost any media will do...\nBear in mind that if you are using for example the bundled media from an old Mac on a different Mac, chances are that the installer package is tied to the original Mac. But it's trivial to work around. Right click on the installer, click Show Contents. It will show you the contents of the installer program, which is just a wrapper around the actual packages. Somewhere there is an ilife.pkg for installing everything, but also individual ones for each app including iDVD - I don't have anything to hand to check the exact names or locations, but hunt around. Then run the individual packages for iDVD (same goes for iWeb which is also deprecated in the same way).\n\nA: I had issues with an iLife disk I had. I picked up an 08' Mac mini, and simply copied the iDVD.app, as well as the files in /Library/Application Support/ to the new machine, and iDVD was now available \n", "Q: Is the iOS5 GM identical to the final version? Are there any differences between the iOS 5 GM seed released to developers and the final version released to the public? If I have the GM installed, do I need to do anything?\n\nA: No changes in file bytesize at least.  The first GM seed for 10.7.2 was initially marginally different to the final version in some way and was updated, but the iOS 5 release is identical.  No need to change anything.  If you were not already on the GM/release version, it would have complained by today and deactivated your phone...\n", "Q: What applications enable AirPlay mirroring for Mac? Do any applications enable AirPlay from my Mac to an Apple TV? I am looking to wirelessly mirror my Mac's display to the TV, similar to the way iPad 2 and iPhone 4S can mirror their displays over AirPlay.\nYes - it's coming as a feature for Mountain Lion, but solutions that work now on Lion are much appreciated.\n\nA: AirParrot is the application you are looking for. It does exactly what you want, mirror Mac screen to AppleTV. It works on Mac OS 10.6 and higher.\n\nA: You folks might be interested in knowing about AirVideo Server, and Airflick. The combination of these two tools will do what you want.  It will use airplay to stream wirelessly from your device to atv2, doing conversion on the fly.  airflick will send files from desktop to atv2. (And photo's, pdf's, desktop)  Very cool stuff.\n\nA: I've only been made aware of streaming it via VLC (see the post here)\nWhat's unknown to me is how AirPlay mirroring works. AirPlay by default supports MPEG & H.264 streams...which I believe this VLC solution will also utilize. Because of that, and the lossy nature of the codec, it won't be crisp, nor would I expect it to be fast enough for things like gaming, etc.\n\nA: With the new OSX Mountain Lion you will be able to airplay from the Mac to an Apple TV.\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/features.html#airplay\n\nA: Not airplay exactly but you can use the internet on the iPad/iPhone to access remote login, once you are in just hit mirror.\n\nA: I use the iOS mirroring from my iPad with an app like Screens to get my Mac display onto an Apple TV 2 when needed.\n\nAs you probably know, the only Mac direct client that sends to AirPlay are some limited apps like iTunes and Safari which send mostly video content to the AirPlay and not the whole Mac user experience including the desktop.\n\nA: Another solution would be to use aTV Flash and stream media from the network. I know this isn't exactly what the question was about, but makes the list more exhausting.\n\nA: I think that what you are after is AirFoil ( http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/ ) which you then use AirFoilSpeakers http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/ios/.\nAs their website says: \n\nPlay any audio across your network to a whole host of devices, all in sync! Airfoil sends audio to remote speakers including iOS devices, other computers, and hardware devices like the Apple TV and AirPort Express. Airfoil for Mac gives you any audio, everywhere.\n\n", "Q: How can I delete duplicate albums from my photo library? Since I updated to iOS 5 I have 4 photo albums in the Photo App. Camera Roll, Photo Stream, Photo Library & iPhone.  Photo Library & iPhone are identical. How do I delete one or the other?\n\nA: Camera Roll, Photo Stream and Photo Library are system albums and cannot be deleted. (Photo Library is a smart album and displays all your photos, regardless of where they actually are).\nYour photos are probably only in the iPhone album, if you delete it, they're probably gone. However to delete it hit the \"Edit\" button, then the little red minus in front of the album you want to delete.\nIf you added the album to your phone by syncing it from your computer, you won't be able to remove it from the phone. In that case connect your phone to iTunes select the photos tab and uncheck the album you want to remove. \n\nA: This worked for me after having the same issue after upgrading to iOS 6 from iOS 5 where photos were showing up twice in the Photo Library. Note that this was on a PC, not a Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Moved all files in the My Pictures folder to the Recycle Bin.\n\n*Synced all picture folders with the iPhone using iTunes.\n\n*Unselected Sync Photos in iTunes and said yes to \"Remove all synced pictures from iPhone?\"\n\n*Restored all pictures from the Recycle Bin to the My Pictures folder.\n\n*Selected Sync Photos from My Pictures in iTunes and synced iPhone.\n\n\nNow all photos show up only once in the Photo Library.  Note as stated above, the Photo Library is a system folder that provides a consolidated view of all pictures stored in the seperate folders.\n\nA: That's how I do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*On my PC desktop, I right clicked and created a new folder. I named it \"Empty folder\".\n\n*I plugged in my phone to computer, opened iTunes.\n\n*Clicked on my phone on the left\n\n*Clicked on \"photos\" on the top\n\n*Clicked the box \"Sync Photos with\"\n\n*Choose the dropdown and \"choose folder\"\n\n*Click \"desktop\" option\n\n*Click on the folder that you created and named whatever you named it.\n\n*Click \"apply/sync\"\n\n*After it finishes, it will have cleared the old cache completely.\n\n\nNow you can go back and sync the folders you want and it will ONLY have those photos.\n", "Q: Mac Pro cd drive stuck open I just got a brand new mac pro. I opened the cd drive with the eject button on the keyboard, and then went to close it the same way, the cd drive goes in, but the metal gate doesn't come back up. What can i do?\n\nA: It's likely the case will have to be replaced. I've fixed this before by lightly tapping on the area below the gate, but it's a recurring thing.\nYou can also slide the optical drive housing out and take a look at the mechanism that raises and lowers the gate. Try manually pulling it up and down a few times.\n\nA: I got it fixed by inserting a needle in the case’s holes right underneath the lid. Keep pushing it up while holding the lid with a slight press, repeat the process and keep switching the holes all the way up! \nEDIT:\nI made a quick video tutorial for easier explanation.\nhttps://youtu.be/PWO96pk1gOs\n\nA: You have a couple options, depending on how stuck it is....\nTap the Hinges\nI had this problem, too. I was able to fix the problem by pushing on the hinges, as shown below. In the image, you can see the cover hidden behind the outer \"mesh\" of the case, below the CD tray opening. It is supposed to snap back up from there when the CD tray hits those little hinges. Sometimes it gets gummed up, and it just needs to be nudged a bit to snap back up. \n\nOpen and Clean the Case\nIf you are unable to nudge it out of place, it's likely really stuck. You'd probably want to remove it from the case and examine it. It might need cleaning: either blowing dust away with compressed air or gentle scrubbing with a toothbrush. If it's oily or sticky, you might want to use a tiny bit of warm water, even less soap, and scrub gently with a toothbrush or paper towel (let it dry completely before connecting it to power!). You might find that the spring mechanism is broken or missing, in which case you'd need to replace those parts. \nProfessional Help!\nIf you are unable to fix it, you can bring it your local Apple Store or authorized retail/repair center and see if they can fix it. \n", "Q: Backup windows PC to time capsule. I'm looking to buy a time capsule to back up my MacBook, however currently there are more Windows machines in my home than macs. Os it possible to use some of the time capsule for windows backups?\nOr at least plugin an external hard drive to the Time Capsule?\n\nA: Sure - Time Capsule shares the internal drive and any external drives just as if they are being served on a PC file server using SMB share technology.\nYou're on your own to select whatever backup software you want that will work with a network shared drive, but there's nothing added to prevent this sort of use in addition to the normal file sharing.\n", "Q: Can't turn on FileVault after restore from Time Machine I have bought myself a SSD and replaced the internal disk with it. \nI was running Lion before (latest patch level). \nI'm using Time Machine to back my laptop up.  \nWhen I was done replacing my HDD I booted up a Lion installation USB stick.\nI created one partition on my SSD and told it to restore from my Time Machine backup.  \nThis worked great,\nhowever I also want to again turn on FileVault and I'm getting the error:  \n\nFileVault can’t be turned on for the disk “Macintosh HD”.\n  Some disk formats don’t support the recovery partition required by encryption.\n  To use encryption, reinstall this version of Mac OS X on a reformatted disk.\n\nI've read that this is because I'm now missing the recovery partition (Didn't even know I had that).\n\n\n*\n\n*What are my options here?  \n\n*Can I create this partition manually?  \n\n\nDo I need to reinstall Lion again (cleanly), patch it, and then restore from Time Machine?\n\nA: From http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4790\n\nFileVault 2 requirements\nFileVault 2 requires OS X Lion and Recovery HD installed on your startup drive, which the OS X Lion installer will attempt to create at installation. If you receive an alert that no Recovery HD could be created and continued to install OS X Lion, you will be unable to use FileVault 2. See this article for more information. Please note that Recovery HD must be present on your computer's startup volume to use FileVault 2 (not an external Recovery HD).\n\nAlso, if you partitioned the new SSD yourself, ensure that you used the GUID partition table scheme.\nRe-installing lion over the top of your existing install will recreate it for you.\n\nA: I have described my solution in this blogpost:\nhttp://hints.binaryage.com/recover-lost-recovery-hd-for-filevault/\n\nA: I has a similar problem. You don't need to reinstall your OS just to get the Recovery partition. Here's what I did to get it to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all make a full backup (I personally use TimeMachine).\n\n*Make sure that you have a bootable Mountain Lion USB drive\n\n*Follow the instructions here: https://brain.osx.ca/groups/coolstuff/wiki/932a7/, but you can probably skip the parts about deleting and merging your current partitions (you probably just got the one partition). \n\n\nAlthough the above link shows you how to make the partition, thus allowing you to use FileVault, it doesn't make my Recovery Partition bootable. I'm okay with that, because I have a bootable USB drive.\n\nA: If you have any other disk around with Recovery Partition — use Carbon Copy Cloner. It allows you to clone Recovery Partition.\n", "Q: How do I undelete an app without losing data? My little sister accidentally deleted one of my iPhone games. I know I can get it back by \"rebuying\" or resynching it via iTunes, but this will give me a clean install, without all my saved game state. Is there any way for me to reverse the deletion without losing all this information? \n\nA: You can restore from your last backup that contained the game, however you will lose any new additions you've made on the phone since the backup. iTunes normally makes a backup every few syncs or days, depending on how often you have plugged it in.\nI would first try and just re-install the game since she may have removed the game but not the actual data associated to it.\nApart from that there is no way to recover the data, since the iPhone does an immediate delete of all files once instructed to do so.\n", "Q: How can I Unlock a iPhone 4S bought in London, in Denmark? My friend purchased two iPhone 4S's in London. The salesman in London refuses to unlock the devices since you need a UK credit card, which my friend doesn't have.\nIs it possible to unlock the devices when he gets back to Denmark, in a Danish phone store?  Or should he refund the device before heading home on Sunday?\n\nA: If it's carrier locked, only the carrier it's locked to can unlock it.\nIf you want an unlock phone, the easiest way to get one is buying directly from Apple. These factory unlocked phones will unlock as soon as you connect them to iTunes (and with iOS 5 possibly the first time you turn it on).\n\nA: The easiest thing to do, is to go to an Apple store, and actually purchase an already unlocked IPhone. The only other way to unlock it, is to send it to an Apple factory to have them unlock it for you. It's part of the proprietary rights thing that Apple has. They've restricted all actual cell-phone companies from unlocking the phones, just because they didn't want to give out the information of HOW to unlock them.\n\nA: I bought a unlock for a iPhone 6 plus locked to O2 paid 59.99 and took about 3 days would recommend service.\n", "Q: How can I change the text colour and font of the username and password in Lion login I would like to change the text you type your username and password in with on the Lion login screen. I have a Command and conquer login screen and I would like to change the colour of the username and password Green and change the font. Is this Possible and how would i do it ? \n\nA: Apple's ideology is mostly to not let the user tweak the design because, in many cases, the user may choose inferior fonts, colors, etc, and thus make Apple production look bad.\nInstead of forcing design choices on user, as proudly does Linux and often does Windows, OS X contains settings that Apple considers “best” for everyone.   \nOf course, some people complain about certain decisions but it's much like MySpace vs Facebook. You can't change fonts and colors on a Facebook page, but frankly, imagine what a mess it would be if anyone could. \nPresumably for this reasons, you can't customize how the text looks in input fields, including the login screen.\n", "Q: Run bash command with current URL as parameter from Firefox and/or safari I'd like to be able, without much hassle, add a video to my Miro Download-queue.\nFrom bash I can do this by entering\nopen -a Miro.app http://vimeo.com/24398084\n\nNow I'd like to do this from within Firefox, preferrably a one-click approach. Is there a firefox addon I could use? Some automator mechanism I could trigger?\n\nA: You could create an automator service like this:\n\nThe service receives no input. It gets the URL of the current page in Safari, and passes it as the argument to open -a Miro.app.\nYou could then assign it a keyboard shortcut, et voilà.\n", "Q: Missing saved files after updating iPod to iOS 5 I updated my iPod to iOS 5 and all my apps and their save files are missing. I backed them up to my computer but can not find them.\nHow do I restore the backup?\n\nA: Backups are managed by iTunes, there's no need for you to know where the actual files are (This is the beauty about Apple things).\nTo restore your backup connect your iPad, right click it in iTunes' sidebar and select restore from backup (Sometimes it helps to restore from backup twice).\n\n", "Q: How can I change Fn keys usage based on application? I would like to know if there is any application that can enable you use use Fn keys differently based on the current application.\nFor example in terminal or you favourite IDE you want to use them as standard function keys but for other applications you want to keep the default Apple keys.\n\nA: Fluor is a relative newcomer to this space that does exactly what you want:\n\nFluor is a tool that allows you to automatically change the behaviour of the keyboard's fn keys depending on the active application.\n\nIt is open source, works on macOs Sierra and is actively developed (as of March 2017).\n\nA: There is an app - FNable - that can help you (works with El Capitan as well).\nIt can switch Fn keys based on app or using a shortcut.\nIt is no longer available on App Store, so here is their website: https://fnable.com/\n\nA: FunctionFlip might be what you're looking for.\n\nFunctionFlip's purpose is simply to disable the special features — rewind, play, mute, etc. — on the function keys. For example, if you \"flip\" F7, F8, and F9, those keys — only those keys — will revert back to normal F keys. Press the fn key with the special key to get the special function back.

I've even been through Apple's support article.\nAcording to the statistics found under my System in the Control Panel, I am in fact running on a 64-bit OS. Below is the error I'm faced with during installation. Clicking OK cancels the installation wizard.\n\n\nA: Did some digging because I knew I have seen this error before. It looks like it is not a direct issue with iTunes but with your Microsoft Virtual C++ redistributable. I resolved it by following the steps in http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_programs/microsoftvc80crtversion80507274053typewin32publick/c1359ee5-e18d-4512-8bff-890936db2810 \nYou are clearly not the only one having this issue, and the steps can be generalized to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run windows update\n\n*Download and update your Microsoft C++ redistributable http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=766a6af7-ec73-40ff-b072-9112bab119c2&displaylang=en#filelist\nThat has worked for me for a couple of different people's problems, and I hope it fixes yours. \nThere are additional steps in the thread such as some registry fixes for the windows installer service, however I would give these steps a try first, especially since they cant really cause any harm.\n\nA: You should reinstall all your Microsoft C++ redistributable packages and install all of them (x86 and x64): for VC 2005, 2008, 2010. and then install iTunes 10.5\n", "Q: How to I set the scroll direction to be \"non\" natural for any new users created on a Lion machine? When a new user account is created on a Lion machine, a \"helpful\" dialog appears to describe \"Natural\" scrolling.\nI want to set the scrolling to be \"unnatural\" for any new users created - is there a defaults setting for that?\n\nA: From a Terminal window:\n\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/User\\ Template/Non_localized/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences  com.apple.swipescrolldirection -bool false\n\nSource\n", "Q: How do I open MS Word and MS Excel documents with Google Docs as default? Is it possible to use Google Docs as the default document viewer for MS Word and Excel files?\n\nA: Currently, you have one thing against the feasibility, and that is Google Docs (even offline mode) is designed to work with the document you uploaded to Google Docs cloud (Remember why Google wants you to put everything on the cloud?)\nIf you don't feel like going to Google Docs and start uploading files manually, you can use Cyberduck, to batch upload all your documents all at once, and then you can use Google Docs to access the documents.\nNote that I put bold on \"currently\". Who knows if Google might release a true offline mode where it can read your documents off your local hard disk, and seamlessly upload it to Google cloud.\n", "Q: Image Uploading to Web Service from iOS I often want to make a picture available on the internet, without wanting it as part of my Twitter stream or Facebook account etc.  For example, posting a screenshot to a thread on a forum or just to include in an email without sending an attachment.\nI'm happy for the pic to be public, but don't necessarily want it to be associated to me if people stumble across it, or have it included with photos I actually care about on services like Flickr etc.  I just want to throw it up to an image hosted and dump it without a trail, in the easiest and quickest way possible.\nThe closest I have found is an app called Picup, which throws a photo onto Imgur without any logging in and captioning etc etc.  If it also had the ability to scale it down to half sized it may be enough, but it doesn't, and as such pics are full sized which increases upload speed and makes the picture potentially too large for sensible linking to on sites that won't auto-scale it.\nSo, what I am after will ideally meet the following criteria:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow me to take a photo, or use a camera roll image\n\n*Resize it automatically via a preset preference (Say max 400 in largest dimension)\n\n*Upload it to am image hosting service that does not require me to have an account or log in\n\n*Present me with the resulting URL in a way that makes copying it simple, perhaps via a big fat COPY URL button, or automatically selecting the text etc\n\n*Optional - provide links for common uses of the URL - compose email, send tweet etc.\n\n\nImagine a scenario; I see a ridiculous haircut in Wallmart, I want to snap it, throw it up, send it to friends, then abandon it so I never have to care about who finds it by accident later with my name against it, and never need to go pruning such childish photos from my genuinely useful and wanted pics such as those in Instagram etc.\n\nA: You could check out CloudApp. It started out on desktop but there are a couple good mobile clients as well, namely Stratus and Cloud2go.\nThese apps don't do any sort of editing. But CloudApp's backend automatically scales images when viewing on a screen that's too small to display them at their native size. Additionally, they provide a 'direct link' option for embedding images directly.\n\nA: Have you looked into skitch for iOS? I use it extensively for screen shots and it has a sketch.com hosting option and also works well with Evernote and other hosting services. The latter has acquired the former, so you might not be able to make a new account, but you can try skitch out for free on Mac OS as well as iOS.\nI could also see using posterous spaces for this sort of thing - they do have an app, but you can just email photos to the web site and it handles thumbnails and processing on the server end of things. Using the service is dead simple and quite pretty layouts are included for free.\n\nA: You sound like you're looking for a native app, but the web app you access at http://imgur.com/ sounds like the feature set you want. Upload from your camera roll, not linked to you, and you get a url you can paste wherever you want.\n\n\nA: I came across TinyPic while looking at this. It seems to fit the bill, but without registering you can only upload one pic at a time.\n\n\nA: Photobucket?\n\nApp Summary: Take Photobucket with you on your iPhone! Upload all your special moments directly to your Photobucket albums.

However if you upgraded from Leopard or earlier it does honor the original settings. However, some updates will disable this setting during the upgrade. \nHave a look under Finder preferences and make sure the Hard Disk box is ticked.\n\n", "Q: In terminal, modify the text that comes before $ In terminal I can always see which path I'm in:\nmacbook-romeo:School romeovs$ echo \"example command\"\n\nwhich I find quite useful. Yet there is a lot of unnecessary stuff here too: macbook-romeo is not useful since I'm always on my macbook (duh). Then again romeovs is quite useful (this is my user name).\nIs there a wan to edit what is shown here? e.g.\n22:50 - School - Romeo$ echo \"example\"\n\nwhere 22:50 is the current time? (This is just an example of course, I won't be needing the time, I'd use like the text to be a bit more minimalistic).\n\nA: This is controlled by the shell variable $PS1\nYou can set this variable to whatever you want, either temporarily or more permanently with a .login or .profile script depending on what shell you use.\nTake a look at the following output for examples:\nLast login: Fri Oct 21 21:59:28 on ttys000\n\nDans-MacBook-Air:~ stuffe$ echo $PS1\n\n\\h:\\W \\u\\$\n\nDans-MacBook-Air:~ stuffe$ PS1=\"Hello World $\"\n\nHello World $PS1=`date`\n\nFri 21 Oct 2011 22:03:23 BSTsleep 60\n\nFri 21 Oct 2011 22:03:24 BSTPS1=\"`date +%H:%M` $\"\n\n22:04 $PS1=\"\\h:\\W \\u\\$\"\n\nDans-MacBook-Air:~ stuffe$\n\nThe possibilities are endless.  There's something you can do with PS2 also, but I think that only takes effect if you are root - details are hazy, my Unix is a long time ago and based on Solaris, not Mac OS X, but the fundamentals are the same.\nAdditional info: As suggested in other replies, there are built-in flags like \\h and \\W etc you can use, but you can also use the output of almost any command too, by using the \"back ticks\" (funny single quotes used in my date example above).  Commands inside back ticks get run and the output substituted, allowing you to include anything, even if there is no built in flag, even for seemingly stupid stuff, whatever you can think of.  Want to include the time of the last entry onto an error log file?  Use something like:\nPS1=\"`tail -1 $LOGFILE | awk '{print $1}'` $ \"\n\n(read the last line of the file referenced by $LOGFILE, and print the 1st column assuming a default field delimiter) etc etc.  If you can execute it, you can include it.\n\nA: This OSX Daily article has some detailed instructions on how to do. In short you need to modify your ~/.bash_profile file and modify the PS1 variable.\nBelow is a list of possible variables you can have displayed:\n\n\n*\n\n*\\d – Current date\n\n*\\t – Current time\n\n*\\h – Host name\n\n*# – Command number\n\n*\\u – User name\n\n*\\W – Current working directory (ie: Desktop/)\n\n*\\w – Current working directory, full path (ie: /Users/Admin/Desktop)\n\n\nA: You need to modify the .bashrc file found in your home directory.\nOpen terminal and do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ~\n\n*touch .bashrc\n\n*open .bashrc\nAdd the following line at the end of your .bashrc file\n\nexport PS1='\\t - \\W - \\u\\$ '\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the file and close your editor\n\n*Go back to the terminal and enter the following command:\nsource .bashrc\nBoom!

Is there a something mechanical in there to adjust the lens or is it completely software?\nGoogle provides this article which suggests some camera phones do have mechanical focus mechanisms.  I couldn't find anything specific to the iPhone however.\n\nA: Autofocus on the iPhone is done via an electrical motor, moving the front lens backward and forward, and software that captures and analyses the image for best sharpness, which usually is the \"sweet\" spot. Recent versions of iOS probably offload the analysis to the image signal processor available since the Apple A5 chip.\n\nA: I may be wrong, but focus always require a combination of moving lenses + software.\n\nA: There are materials that change their index of refraction or shape with an electrical bias. A lens focal length could be controlled this way too. I would be surprised if an electric motor is involved, though I could imagine a MEMs device or a piezo-electric mounting material pushing the lens against a spring. This is all speculative.\n", "Q: How do I delete all Terminal mail? I set up a cronjob a long time ago that now doesn't exist. Whenever I open up Terminal, it now says \"You have mail\".

Note to others that a quick edit can pile up reports rapidly.\n\nA: I know this post is old, but I want to contribute with an answer.\nto delete your mail messages do the following:\nsudo rm /var/mail/[user]\n\nAnd in order to the question, I suggest you do the following to each crontab you do not want to send an email notification (this way your mail will not have mails)\n* * * * * /path/to/script.sh > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nor\n* * * * * command > /dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nA: Launch the UNIX mail utility by running the following at the command prompt (in e.g. Terminal.app):\n$ mail\n\nYou'll see a list of all your messages. From the mail prompt, do\n? delete *\n? q\n\nAnd that should be it. Make sure do to the q after the delete * command, that saves the changes to disk.\n\nA: You may also go the direct route and just run : > /var/mail/$USER to empty the mail file.\nPS: Deleting the mail file requires sudo, just setting it to empty is enough.\n", "Q: Favicons not showing in Safari 5.1.1 on OSX Lion? Since upgrading to Safari 5.1.1 none of the websites I am visiting is displaying Favicons. I had a look in ~/Library/Safari/Icons to try and reset these but noticed that the file/folder doesn't exist, so the problem is not related to the caching.\nThis was working fine in a clean install of Lion before upgrading to 10.7.2. Even installing Glims and setting the icons to display in the tab headers did not fix the problem.\nIs anyone aware of a fix for this, or whether this is a known bug?\n\nA: After doing some research it turns out I am not the only one with this problem, and Safari has changed the location for it's favicon database. \nFrom this Apple Forum discussion:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Quit Safari. \n  \n*Go to ~/Library/Safari. \n  Move the WebpageIcons.db file from the Safari folder to the Trash.\n  \n*Relaunch Safari.\n  \n\n", "Q: When external speakers are plugged in to headphone jack of Macbook Pro (with Lion), output destination randomly switches I have an essentially new MacBook Pro with Lion and all updates applied, and am wondering if this is a hardware or software problem.  Essentially with something plugged into the headphone jack, things work as they are supposed to for a while, then the sound will switch back to internal speakers, or sometimes 'digital out' (I can watch it change in the system settings), and then often switch back.  It doesn't seem to follow any sort of pattern or be related to any specific application that could be open, and happens with different sources of audio (iTunes, streaming from the web), and different external speakers or headphones plugged in.  It does seem to be better for a while each time I unplug and plug back in the jack.\n\nA: It sounds like a hardware problem in the jack. If you can put pressure on the external part of the plug and change it: cause static or breakup it's probably a hardware problem in the jack.\nIf you had said you only tried one set of headphones then I'd have said it's probably a problem in the headphone plug but if it's multiple phones and speakers then it's probably the jack.\nThere's a sensor in that jack that monitors if something's in it or not to switch off the internal speakers. The if there's continuous sound, just switching from internal to external the problem may be that sensor. If the sound cuts out from both internal and external once in a while it's probably the jack.\nIf the MacBook Pro is still under warranty I'd have Apple look at it, they'll swap motherboard to make it right if it's a hardware problem at no cost to you.\n", "Q: Downgrading IOS from IOS 5 to 4.2 I have upgraded my iPod to IOS 5 but now I want to go back to IOS 4.2. How can I do this. Is there any feature in iTunes which can be utilized or I need a .iDYSM file.\n\nA: Restoring to 4.2 is not possible unless you had your iPhone jailbroken when 4.2 was the current version and saved Apples signature with this.\nBut if you only want back to iOS 4 you might still have a chance, because as far as I know 4.3.5 images are still being authenticated by Apple.\nSo you can try and download the 4.3.5 image (just google for it), and hold alt while clicking restore in iTunes. It will ask you with which file you want to restore. \nSelect the downloaded file and unless an error pops up (which might be the case if Apple decided not to allow installations of 4.3.5 anymore) you should be running iOS 4.\n(Also if you do this, you should do it soon, Apple won't authenticate 4.3.5 images forever.)\n", "Q: Can apps purchased from one Apple ID be shared between multiple iTunes libraries? We have a number of iDevices in the family, and each user has their own Apple ID. Also, each person has their own computer to sync apps and other content.\nIf I purchase an app for my iPod, Can I share it with my wife and son, each of whom have their own IDs?  \nIf so, how do I share purchased apps, if each person has their own computer or iTunes library?\n\nA: Unfortunately the only way to share apps is to use the same Apple ID for purchases on every device. \nYou can use different IDs for iCloud, but you need to sign into the App Store with the same ID.\nIf you're signed in to the App Store with the correct ID you can download previously purchased apps for free, each person haven their own computer and iTunes library doesn't matter.\n\nA: With Home Sharing and Authorizing computers every person can have their own account and still use apps purchased by other family members.\nHome sharing will allow you to stream, browse and copy content, including apps, between machines. You turn on home sharing one each machine under iTunes's Advanced menu.  You use the same Apple ID on each machine.  It doesn't matter which Apple ID just as long as it's the same one, all this ID is for is to make all of the machines known about the Home share you're setting up. Apple has instructions online: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3819.  \nAuthorizing each computer lets you use protected contact on that machine, including syncing apps to associated iOS devices. You'll need to authorize each computer with each of the accounts you will be purchasing apps with.  For example, my wife and I both need to authorize our son's machine. Again, apple has instructions online: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1420 . \nThere is a limit to how many machines you can authorize.\nOnce you do both these things each person can use Home Sharing to look at the apps on another machine (its listed in the iTune's sidebar), import those apps to their own machine and those apps will sync to their iPod.   \nThe one down side is app updates.  You will need to reenter your password on each iPod in order to download an update. Alternatively, the original purchaser can download the update and the others can grab it again using Home Sharing.\n\nA: You can now use iCloud \"Family Sharing\" to share content with multiple Apple ID's.\n\nA: Home Sharing is not the same as de-authorizing a device. Home sharing allows two devices to access media on the same iTunes account, but not the apps.  If I understand it correctly Apps can be accessed by only one device - the device authorized for that account. You can \"de-authorize\" a device and then add a new device to the account to allow access the apps previously on the old device. But apps can be used only by the (one) device authorized on that account.\n\nA: Nope, can only be shared with one Apple ID. I have tried this already and it didn't work. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Once you have home sharing set up, you can log out of itunes account ON the Device you wish to have the App on..  Then sign back in on the device, using the account that has purchased the app.  Then ON the Device, use the APP Store app and search for the app.. then you will see the icloud symbol, and download it to the device, or \"re-purchase\" it as the video suggests.

I had to restore my iMac from a Time Machine backup.\nEverything seemed fine until I tried to start Office 2011 and it is asking me to re-enter my product key. I am trying to locate my key (I believe I downloaded this version originally and it should be in my email but I can't find it)\nI tried a program that is supposed to \"find the keys for products installed on your computer\" (Mac Product Key Finder) and it found my very old Office 2008 key, but not 2011.\nI am surprised that if I had a totally working install before recovering from back-up that this wasn't restored as well - do I have any options to find it hiding somewhere on my drive?\nNote: The recovery was after a hard drive was replaced by the Apple store - if that makes a difference, so this is a new internal drive.\n\nA: Office 2011 requires activation and is tied to your hardware so it might very well be that you need to reactivate Office 2011 after the HD change. The whole activation procedure is described in Office for Mac 2011 Activation and Product key Information (via archive.org). According to this document, the product key was mailed to you in a mail with subject \"Microsoft Office for Mac – Order Confirmation\".\n\nMicrosoft has replaced the support article linked above with a new one describing how to Activate Office for Mac 2011. As mentioned on the top of that page\n\nSupport for Office for Mac 2011 ended on October 10, 2017. All of your Office for Mac 2011 apps will continue to function. However, you could expose yourself to serious and potentially harmful security risks. Upgrade to a newer version of Office so you can stay up to date with all the latest features, patches, and security updates.\n\n\nA: This thread is a bit old, but in case someone else finds themselves looking for the answer, this just worked for me:\nTo move / re-install your licensed copy of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac on a different computer / OSX installation, and re-authorize it without the license / serial / key available, copy the following from the old machine to the corresponding (same) spot on the new computer.\nPlease note that you should be looking for these folders in the root directory of the drive on which OSX is installed-- NOT in your user directory. To get there, in the Finder click Go-->Computer-->[name of the hard drive that has OSX installed...usually \"Macintosh HD\"]...then look for the following folders:\n\n*\n\n*/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011 folder (copy the entire folder, with all its contents)\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.microsoft.office.licensing.helper.plist\n\n*/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.microsoft.office.licensing.helper\n\n*/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist\n\nFrom:\nhttp://cwl.cc/2012/02/easy-way-to-move-your-microsoft-office.html\nNote NOV2020: If you just copy/paste the last file \"/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist\" as instructed above, it should work as well. For transparency, this was tested on an old mbp with El Capitan and incoming connections blocked with Firewall (unsure if Firewall would affect outcome).\n\nA: Its only in your email if you bought it online. If you bought it in Best Buy and are in another city (as I am right now) apparently you are out of luck!\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone 4S running iOS 5 not showing in iTunes sidebar when using WiFi sync? I've enabled WiFi sync for my 4S and my first gen iPad, both running iOS5. When my phone is plugged in to my computer with a USB cable, it shows up in the sidebar, but as soon as it's unplugged it goes away. The iPad stays in the sidebar until I manually eject it.\nIt seems that my iPad is behaving 'correctly', at least based on This kbase article.\nToggling WiFi sync when the phone is connected doesn't seem to solve it.\nI've also tried the steps outlined in this article to no avail.\nThis was a fresh install, I didn't import a backup from a previous device. I've restored and set up as new, and the same behavior happens.\nI had originally thought it was because my computer had switched to an 802.11n 5Ghz network while my phone remained on the 802.11n 2.4Ghz network, but even when they're on the same exact network I see this behavior.\n\nA: I had this problem with an iPad. I did the initial setup over USB, enabled Wi-Fi sync, but then when I removed the iPad, it disappeared from the iTunes sidebar, but my iPhone didn't have that problem.\nTurned out that I had been disconnecting the USB end of the cable from my Mac first; disconnecting the dock connector end from the iPad (then removing the USB end) made it stay in the sidebar. Completely bonkers, really doesn't seem like it should be that way (or even that iTunes could discern what was disconnected when), but that's what fixed it for me.\n\nA: I have tried reinstalling iTunes, restoring the software, rebooting the router and pretty much every combination of checkboxes checked and unchecked and you know what fixed it for me?\nRebooting my MacBook.\nI've been struggling with this for several hours and it never came to me to reboot my laptop.\nSo my guess is that it has to do with the computer's wifi connection. Flush that cache, reconnect that wifi, or just reboot the thing.\nI hope this helps someone.

The Operating System came installed on the SSD drive. \nMy intention was to put the OS on the HD based on its longer potential lifespan and use the SDD for things like the Photoshop scratch disk.  Getting things set up this way at this point would seem to require me to re-install the OS and specify the HD, which would not be the end of the world because I  have not done much configuration yet.  \nAre there other options I should be considering here?  My goal is maximum long term reliability, but I do also want to take advantage of the SDD's strong points.  \n\nA: My first advice: don't fret too much over SSD lifespans or performance degradation. While it has been an issue (and still is), for almost everyone it's not likely to be an issue over the lifespan of your computer. Far more likely that you'll want to replace your iMac before the flash runs out of writes. Additionally, the Samsung and Toshiba drives Apple currently uses are are more in the reliability end of the spectrum, rather than sacrificing lifespan for huge speeds.\nSecondly, to really get the most benefits out of the SSD, you'll want to put your OS and apps on the SSD, and big files like movies, music and photo libraries on the HD (if you keep the metadata files like iTunes Library.itl on the SSD, you get speed improvements opening big libraries, without having to store the big files there). The most noticeable improvements from SSDs aren't the huge sequential r/w speeds, but the smaller random access speeds, which you really notice for OS and app start times, and any memory paging to disk.\n", "Q: iOS 5 'home sharing' feature missing? Previous to the update to iOS 5, the 'home sharing' feature in the iPad's iPod app worked as expected.

I have an Easybox router from Vodafone and my iPad was connected to that router. But this router has an Airport Extreme in bridged mode connected to it and that is where my iTunes was connected to. As soon as my iOS devices logged into the Airport Extreme, the button appeared.\nI guess you need to enable certain ports for Bonjour to work on the Easybox...\n\nA: iPhone 4S, iPad 2, Home shares showing on other PCs on the network but not iOS devices.\nTried everything above, yada yada no changes.\nSolution: Check your wireless router settings. Specifically, Mulitcast Filtering\nOn a Linksys WRT610N, go to Security \\ Firewall \\ Internet Filter\nPut a check beside \"Multicast Filtering\" and save settings\nNo other changes required.\nRestart your IOS device\n\"Shared\" now appears under \"More\" button on both iPhone and iPad\n\nA: Tried all the above. In the end having everything set on my iPad and iTunes and then turning router off and on. Then it worked!\n\nA: Try enabling \"Sound Check\" in iPad's Music Settings. After this the \"More\"-button was shown on my iPad.\n", "Q: How can I create a multipage PDF from JPG's in Preview? I just upgraded to Lion recently. When I was on Snow Leopard, creating a multi-page PDF document in Preview was simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would open up the image\n\n*Save it as a PDF\n\n*Open up the PDF\n\n*Open up the panel that displays pages (on the left)(Menu:View/Thumbnails)\n\n*Drag and drop images on this \"page panel\" below the first image\n\n*Save the file again.\n\n\nThis would create a multi-page PDF file where each page is an image.\nI've tried doing the same thing in Lion, but it doesn't produce the same results. Although in step 5 it appears as though a multipage document is created, after you save it, the file size becomes much bigger than the original one page PDF, but after opening it, all you can see is a single page.\nIs there any way to do this in Lion?\n\nA: I think I found an easier way with Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all images and right click, choose Open with Preview.\n\n*Select all images inside Preview (cmd+a) and right click, Export as…\n\n*Choose a folder where all the new .pdf files will be saved.\n\n*Open one of the .pdf files in Preview, and drag n'drop the all the other files over the Thumbnail of the current file in Preview.\n\nA: This works for me on Mountain Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open all the JPG's in Preview so that the files are selectable within the one window, i.e. thumbnails of the JPG's are viewable in the selection pane located the window's left side.\n\n*Click in the selection pane and select all the thumbnails with Cmd-A.\n\n*Select File > Print... from the menu bar.\n\n*Select PDF > (from the drop down) Save as PDF... from within the Print Dialog. \n\n\n*Take it from there...\n\nA: We are using Snow Leopard and having the same results as Daniel Serodio, i.e. the first page looks good (no border) while all the following pages have an annoying white border around the image.\nThe only workaround we found adds another step to the process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open all jpegs in Preview and display the sidebar. The jpegs will display in one window but still be separate files, as discussed above.\n\n*Select all the thumbnails in the sidebar (Command-A.)\n\n*Right-click in the sidebar area and choose Save a Copy to Folder. In the following dialog, choose PDF for the format, and choose a place to save the PDFs. Preview saves the jpegs as individual PDFs to your selected folder.\n\n*Close out of the jpegs and open the LAST of the PDFs you just made* and display the sidebar. Now follow steps as above: select all of the rest of the PDFs in the Finder, and drag them ONTO the page thumbnail icon in the sidebar of Preview to get a multi-page PDF. \n\n*Save!\n*For some reason Preview is kicking this \"seed\" PDF to the end when I add the additional PDF files, so that's why I'm saying start with your last page instead of the first page, so you don't have to re-order them again.\n\nA: Oops, just tried it again. The problem was that I was dropping the files below the page rather than on the page thumbnail.\n\nA: Worked for me on Yosemite 10.10. Need to be sure to drop the images you want to add to the pdf ON the thumbnail not below as another person mentioned.\nI was sending images to my brother who is on a pc (not sure if that matters).\nHe said he had to click on each picture and say save as...asked if I could make it a pdf then he could just click once to save a set. \nCould have just sent him a zipped file but the idea of creating a pdf interested me, found this and it worked.\nThanks to the original poster of the answer.\n\nA: You can also use an external tool such as http://www.from-jpg-to-pdf.com/ which is a website designed to easily convert .jpg to .pdf.\n\nA: Apple's built-in Preview application (free) alone sufficient to make small changes in PDF documents. When you double click on any PDF file, it opens, by default, in Preview. You can use Preview app to merge, split, mark up, annotate, and sign PDF files. Preview is the easiest solution to view, create and edit PDF documents on Mac.\nWith long documents or for complex editing tasks, third-party PDF editors like PDFPen or this one (cheap alternative to PDFPen) are the best bet.\n", "Q: How do I monitor bandwidth use of specific websites? I'm using Chrome on SnowLeopard.  I use the www a lot.  I want to monitor how much bandwidth I use for all SE sites in one month.  I don't care how much bandwidth is used on any other website.\nWhat is the easiest way to do this?\nBest answer will be an accurate tool to measure; but a reasonable estimate is acceptable too.\n\nA: Historygram is a neat extension for Safari, but it appears to only measure visits, not bandwidth. Feel free to email the author and ask if this extension could easily be modified to include bandwidth measurement.\n", "Q: iTunes is trying to upgrade to iOS 4.3.5 instead of iOS 5 Currently I'm running iOS 4.3.3 on my iPad.\nI was expecting to ugrade to iOS 5 directly.but iTunes is trying to upgrade to iOS 4.3.5.\nDo I need to first upgrade to 4.3.5 and then to iOS 5? Is there any way to upgrade to iOS 5 directly?\nI can, however, download the ipsw. But anyway I would like to know.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Connected my iPad, started iTunes, and was offered iOS 4.3.5 (and this was just last week!). I had iTunes up to date and everything.\nI canceled the upgrade, closed and reopened iTunes, and it then decided to offer to upgrade to 5.0.\nI think it will resolve itself. Try restarting.\n\nA: What version of iTunes are you using? \nTo upgrade to iOS 5 you need the latest iTunes 10.5, since the earlier versions do not recognize the iOS 5 IPSW and cannot sync with iOS 5. They will also not detect the iOS 5 upgrade on the iTunes server.\n", "Q: Configure Launchpad OSX Lion How to configure launchpad on OSX Lion?\nLike \n\n\n*\n\n*Hide some application\n\n*Group application into folder\n\n*Sort application alphabetical\n\n\nA: Lion’s LaunchPad acts much like iOS’ Springboard (the iDevice home screen launcher), which means that\n\n\n*\n\n*you can create folders by dragging one Launchpad app icon onto another – add more items by dragging them onto the newly created folder. Folders can be renamed by clicking their title when opened. They cannot be nested.\n\n*you can only sort items by dragging them around.\n\n*hiding apps is not a feature (there is a closing cross on App Store installed apps when you press Option, but this uninstalls the app – it does not hide it from Launchpad). Use Launchpad-Control (freeware) to achieve that.\n\n", "Q: Any issues upgrading a MacBookPro4,1 (Early 2008) to Lion? I have a MacBookPro4,1 (Early 2008) with the following specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core 2 Duo 2.5 GHz\n\n*4 GB RAM\n\n\nI know that this model is supported by Lion but I'd like to know by people who has already performed the upgrade if:\n\n\n*\n\n*they've noticed a performance degradation after the upgrade\n\n*if there are any other gotchas when upgrading\n\n\nA: I upgraded my MacBook Pro 3,1 (late 2007) with 6GB RAM to Lion. There are no specific problems, but note that the trackpad cannot use multi-touch gestures. Also, the networking circuitry in my MacBook Pro does not support AirDrop, so I can't use that. I noticed inconsistent behavior with keyboard backlighting on my model with Lion, but since I have never seen the need for that feature, I just disabled it altogether.\n\nA: I had the same MacBook Pro (same processor, same RAM) and my wife has it now. I put Lion and Lion update on it early on and we've had no problems at all. Lion feels fine on the machine, no performance problems at all.\nTo be fair, my wife rarely taxes things like people in this discussion might but she does leave Safari, iTunes, and a few more applications running a lot and she's never crashed or yelled at me for ruining her life ;)\nI bought Lion for my computer (current model MBP) and made an install USB drive with the Lion installer knowing I'd be putting it on her machine as well. I use SuperDuper to back up our machines and I made a backup of her machine, booted it from the Lion USB drive, used disk tools to erase and repartition the drive (just to clean things up), did a clean install of Lion, then used migration assistant to pull her account back in.\nI didn't copy over the backup until we were sure Lion was working right and she had everything and in fact, we had no problems and she's been using it ever since, including the recent upgrade for iCloud which she uses too.\nTip: The best way to make that machine last even longer is to put an SSD in it. OWC has decent SSDs and the speed increase will blow your mind. You might consider doing this kind of upgrade at the same time you do the Lion upgrade, not because Lion needs it, more just to give you another year on that machine before buying a new one. If you buy a new one you can take the SSD with you if you like, either as a replacement internal drive or as an external.\nUnless you need huge storage an SSD is the single best performance investment you can make in an older MacBook Pro that's capable of running Lion.\n\nA: Check out the system requirements here for OS X 10.7 Lion here. I will say that I have installed Lion on systems with 1GB of RAM, and a slower processor than yours. It still ran buttery smooth, so you'll be just fine. Good luck, and enjoy!\n\nA: Test your backup or install lion onto an external drive so you can judge for yourself would be my best tip. Jump in after checking your parachute and make sure you get a do-over if needed. \n\nPerformance is surely degraded since more things run in the background - whether you notice it or even care with the new functionality is hard to guess. \nOther parts of the system are optimized and feel much faster (time machine, calculating sizes of folders in Finder) and breathe new life into old macs. \nIn general, macs before multitouch glass trackpads feel \"old\" and miss out on AirDrop and gestures othe than two finger scroll / tap. With RAM, they do generally run very well and with an SSD they can be stunningly fast. \n\nA: I have the same model. I installed Lion and the first thing I noticed was a pretty severe battery drain. There are others having the same kind of problem. It's a real bummer. There are also a few annoyances, but not exclusive to this particular model. You can enable AirDrop -- if you really want it -- via a Terminal command. Multi-touch gestures work, to some degree... just hard to do some with the trackpad button in the way. I'm a bit disappointed in some of the speed issues. Lion is speedy on newer machines. For this MBP, I think Snow Leopard worked best.\n\nA: My specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro 3.1 with 2.2 Ghz C2D, yes it's my main station...\n\n*4GB RAM 800 Mhz\n\n*Graphics: GeForce 8600M GT with 128 MB  ⇐ This is important! Lion is quite demanding for basic visuals like Mission Control and Launchpad.\nMy experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*faster boot time\n\n*system is less responsive. I guess it's do to the graphics.\n\n*generally low fps for any animation, that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*resizing windows\n\n*launchpad, up to the point that it's really irritating\n\n*mission control, but you can live with it\n\n*turing windows into full screen mode\n\n\n\nBasically, those nice new feature tend to suck a little...I was so angry with it, that I almost decided to buy a new MBP. I ended up making an SSD upgrade instead due to the obvious price difference.\nWhat you're missing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multitouch operations. Use hot corners instead. You can use the two finger scrolling. That feature was introduced with the PowerBooks.\n\n*Momentum scrolling. It's not like the trackpad cannot handle it, but the OS enables it only when connecting a bluetooth magic trackpad.\n\n*Airdrop. But there are third-party solutions that have been around for quite a while already. \n\n\nEdit:\nIt's possible to enable Airdrop on unsupported Macs.\n", "Q: iPad iOS 5 update gets stuck during iCloud setup I just updated my iPad 2 to iOS 5.  At the step for setting up iCloud, I said no to iCloud.  My iPad appears to be stuck at this step, displaying \"setting up iCloud\" for over an hour.  The only recourse appears to be to start over, which suggests that the iPad will be erased. What can I do about this? Thank you.\n\nA: My iPod Touch was stuck on this screen.  I powered off and on and it unstuck.\nsee: Apple Community Forums\n\nA: Restart the iPhone and redo the iCloud steps.\nDown the bottom of the page try clicking \"Skip this Step\".\nAlso works if you don't want to set up a new Apple ID..\n", "Q: How to use Telnet with Personal Hotspot (tethering)? I got the Personal Hotspot working great, with both USB and WiFi (on different computers/devices).\nHowever, I am not able to ping or telnet the other computer. Both computers can ping the iPhone (default gateway). I found the other computers IP through ifconfig and ipconfig.\nIs there a limitation on what kind of traffic can go through a Personal Hotspot? Where can I find support or documentation? (I searched Google and Apple support). Are there any settings or configuration files?\nIs there another solution, such as using my own WiFi or wired router for local traffic and the iPhone for internet?\nUsing version 4.3.3.\nThanks.\n\nA: OK, I found one solution that works great.\nSince the connection between the computers was originally wired with a router, I plugged them both into the router.\nThen I removed the default gateway settings from the wired connection. This prevents them from going to the internet via the wired connection.\nBut, they are both connected to iPhone by wireless or USB (a separate wired connection), so they go to the internet through iPhone. The first time it takes the computer about 10 seconds to figure this out.\nThe caveat is that you need 2 interfaces for each device and a way to connect separate from iPhone.\n", "Q: iPhone backup not starting After upgrading to iOS 5, I have some issues with my iPhone 4.\nI did not activate iCloud backups, preferring to keep them on my MacBook Pro, but when I sync the phone to iTunes the backup does not start, neither through wi-fi nor by connecting the phone to the mac with the USB cable. It syncs without any problem, but the backup is not happening.\nIs there a way to manually trigger the backup?\nThe last backup listed in Itunes is the one made during the update to iOS 5, and not having regular backups makes me feel nervous. \n\nA: Try logging out and logging in again. There was an issue with some helper not restarting the right way after the required upgrades, relogging helped me. If that doesn't work, try rebooting.\n\nA: Keep in mind that backups are only done once a day at minimum and at most every few days depending on how often you plug it in, so that would be the reason you don't see it every time you sync. However you can manually initiate a backup by right-clicking on your device on the iTunes Sidebar and selecting backup.\n\nTo confirm that the backups are indeed happening you can look under Settings/Preferences for the Devices tab which will show you the status and dates of the last backup. I use iCloud backup so I don't have a status on mine at the moment.\n\nThese steps apply to both Mac and Windows\n", "Q: Finder search does not find all relevant documents MacOS 10.6.8 I'm having problems with the search in Finder windows in MacOS X 10.6.8.\nIf I'm typing a search keyword in the textbox in a finder window and search for \"file name\" or \"content\", I get no or only a few results, although there should be much more results.\nIs this a bug in OS X?\ne.g. if I activate the search for \"file name\" and type \"a\" in the text box, I get 8 results.\nWhen I search for \"b\" instead, I get 61 results, and 60 of them have an \"a\" in the file name!\nIs this a known bug?\nIs there a solution?\n\nEdit: I've tried to \n\n\n*\n\n*rebuild the spotlight index with sudo mdutil -E _PathOfPartition_\n\n*repaired permissions on the startup drive\n\n\n... but no change - Finder/Spotlight does not list files as results, although they exist and match the search criteria.\n\nA: On my system, typing successive letters always shrinks the results menu.  Have you tried rebuilding your Spotlight index?  Open terminal in an admin account and type:\nsudo mdutil -i on \"/Volumes/YourHardDiskNameHere\"\n\n, authenticate with your password, and go get a coffee.\nEdit:\nAnother way to accomplish this is to open Spotlight preferences to the privacy tab and drag your HDD icon from finder onto the \"Prevent spotlight...\" list.  Close preferences (may not be necessary - ?). Open it again to the same tab and use the +/- buttons to delete the disk.  Re-indexing should start.\n\nA: After long research and tests I finally found the solution: \nI'm using 2 partitions - one for the system files (and users directories) and one for my data. \nShortly I created a new user account for an apple service technician and wanted to remove the read permissions for my data partition.\nI did this with BatCHMOD and it apparently I unintentionally made the new (temporary) user account the owner of all my files (with no read permission!).\nSo I had read & write permissions for my files, however Spotlight was not able to find them.\n\n\n*\n\n*I changed the owner of the whole partition (and its contents) back to my account and\n\n*removed the temporary user account after the repair\n\n*rebuilt the index with sudo mdutil -E /Volumes/*\nand now finally Spotlight is able to filter and find all files\n:)\nremark: there are 2 facts which are still confusing for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*spotlight seems to be unable to find files/folders, which I do not own?!\n\n*a one letter search term for file names does not work as I would have expected, as it does not list all files which contain the letter in their name!

Everytime I start my MacBook Pro (which is set to automatically boot into my account) I get the error message \"unable to unlock login keychain\" with 3 options - continue (which will give me errors as I use my computer whenever I need the login keychain) create new keychain (I know this creates a new keychain, but does it copy all my keys?  Or are they lost now?)  or Update keychain password.\nI've used the password which I think should work, but it doesn't.  Now my machine auto logs in, and I get the error, and at the moment I'm clicking continue.\nI've tried using keychain repair, which finds no errors.\nPlease: How should I trouble shoot my keychain errors?  How do I fix my keychain errors?  Is there any way to keep all my old passwords, or have I lost those?\n\nA: If you cannot unlock the keychain then its contents are lost, they're encrypted using the keychain password.\nYour login keychain and password are linked, if the login password is changed via system preferences the keychain password is changed to the new password also. However, it is possible that the login password can be changed by other means whilst not changing the keychain password.\nWhen the system logs in it will try to unlock your keychain with the same login password - if they don't match, you'll see the error message you're seeing.\nIf you manage to remember the keychain password and unlock the keychain you should change your login password to match. But, as I said initially, you're out of luck if you can't remember the password.\n", "Q: How do I wipe my MB Air's drive and start fresh? I want to return my Air to the original factory settings, to the way it was before I added all kinds of  junk to the solid state drive.\nI'm running Snow Leopard. So after I wipe it clean, I plan to go to the App Store and buy Lion.\n\nA: If you bought a pre-Lion Macbook Air, it should have shipped with a system restore USB drive. This is exactly the scenario for which it exists: restoring your system to factory condition. Back up all your data, so you can keep what you want. Then, plug in the restore drive, and hold down the option key (⌥) when you boot. Select the restore drive, and follow the instructions to install a clean install of Snow Leopard.\n\nA: If you're planning on immediately upgrading to Lion, you could save some time by downloading Lion first, and making your own USB installer. You can still wipe the drive clean first, but this way you're only doing 1 OS install instead of 2.\n", "Q: How can I change a defunct Apple ID email address? I never changed my student email account to which all app purchases have been made. I just upgraded to iOS 5, and it requires to authenticate the iCloud, by verifying an email sent to the now defunct email address. The problem is that I can't even change my email adress, because the system wants to verify my iCloud account first. It's a circular problem!\nCan't change email because I haven't verified iCloud, and I can't verify iCloud because my old email is now defunct.\nWhat can I do?? \n\nA: Perhaps you could try addressing the problem from the other side of the issue.  When I faced a similar problem with my now defunct student email address on another account, the solution turned out to be contacting the IT department of my old school and convincing them to temporarily re-instate my student email address.  Once I convinced them to do it, it turned out to be a really simple process.  I was able to change over and recover passwords from several services tied to the old email address, and once completed just had them deactivate it again.  Your milage may vary depending on your educational institution, but it's definitely worth a shot.\n\nA: Try to use https://appleid.apple.com/ which allows you to change Apple ID details:\n\nSelect \"Manage your account\" and use your existing Apple ID and password to log in.\n\nChoose the option to edit your Apple ID/Primary Email Address:\n\nand enter a new one.\n\n\nA: Have you tried going to https://iforgot.apple.com/? You should be able to change your Apple ID to an existing email address and subsequently sign up for iCloud.\n", "Q: How to configure a static IP for a specific access point on OS X? I own a MacBook Pro and always used Ubuntu in the past. In Ubuntu, I was able to configure my IP, DNS, Gateway, for a specific access point. There was a list of all the access points, each one with its own settings.\nThe goal I want to achieve is to do port forwarding in my own local network with static IP and still being able to connect with automatic DHCP settings  somewhere else (not my own network).\nBut I'm unable to do/find this in Mac OS X. Is it possible (with or without extra applications)?\n\nA: I have found it myself. It's already built in in OS X. In System Preferences, goto Network and at the top of the window, you can see a combobox which says: Location. You have to click it and select Edit Locations.\n\nAt this picture I have already created my Home Network.\nCreate and configure the Home network. And click Apply afterwards. Close the window.\nFrom now on you can choose which configuration (or Location) you want to use by opening the Apple-menu () in the Menu Bar. And choose from the Location submenu.\n\n", "Q: Photo meta data editor for OS X? I'm looking for software that will let me do bulk edits on metadata for photos in my iPhoto library. Specifically I'd like to be able to edit the date on the photos and the location information.\nI'm going to be adjusting large numbers of photos so batch operations are an absolute must for me. Bonus points if I can copy and paste meta data information from one photo to many other photos. And it would be especially helpful if I could copy just specific meta data fields, not all the data or none of the data.\nI've already tried to do some of this stuff in iPhoto and some of it is possible, but not great, and some of it is impossible. For example: I can edit the location meta data on photos but the UI for doing so is kind of awkward and slow, though it does support batch editing. I cannot edit the date and time stamp on photos though. That's one field I'd really like to edit (because the camera had the wrong date and time on them when some of these photos were taken).\nSo I'm looking for non-iPhoto suggestions here.\n\nA: You can edit Date and Time in iPhoto, and do it in batches too: Photos Menu -> Adjust Date and Time - and it will also correct the date and time on the original file if you choose to.\nAnother thing to consider: iPhoto catalogues the images on import. If you subsequently change the metadata with a 3rd party App, iPhoto won't recognise this. It will not rescan for changed metadata, so while you're original files may be corrected, it'll make no difference in iPhoto.\n", "Q: Command line utility to create screenshot Is there some command line utility to create a screenshot of the my screen and store it as png? (Preferably one in the system, without need to install anything new)\n\nA: It sounds like you're looking for the command screencapture, which, according to its man page, is to \"capture images from the screen and save them to a file or the clipboard\".\nIt's been a standard part of OS X since 10.2.\n", "Q: What kind of servers does Apple have in their NC datacenter? Siri telling me more often than not that it is having trouble connecting got me wondering what kind of servers Apple is filling its datacenters with. At some point in the past, I'd have assumed Xserves running OSX Server, but given that they are no longer making Xserves (or at least they are not commercially available), I can't help picturing pallets of Dell servers being unloaded and racked at the North Carolina datacenter.\nIs Apple running its datacenter on Linux or Windows? Are they using standard PC hardware from Dell or IBM or HP? Or have they continued to manufacture Xserves for their own use and have everything running Lion Server? \n\nA: I have read that Apple uses Microsoft Windows Azure and Amazon Web Services as at least part of their software platform for iCloud. Sounds like heresy, but there appears to be some evidence to support this.\n\nA: Following through from the Wheat's answer, comes this article which indicates that the datacenter contains a mix of \"Mac OS X, IBM/AIX, Sun/Solaris, and Linux systems...Red Hat Linux and Oracle Enterprise Linux\".\nAt least it is good to see that Dell isn't listed explicitly.\n", "Q: Should I expect battery life on an iPhone 4S to be significantly worse than on a 3GS? I just upgraded from a 3GS to a 4s and my battery life is dramatically worse. I wasn't expecting it to be the same (though I was hoping that it might even be better), but I'm seeing a big difference. Since I have the same settings as I did previously, I don't think the problem has to do with any configuration differences (for example, I have email set to check manually on both). I was even running on iOS 5 on the 3GS, so I can't really point to that either. Siri is one software bit which is 4s only, but I can't imagine that is the culprit as I don't think it would always be running.\nI've restarted the phone to make sure that no out of control process is running in the background.\nSo is the iPhone 4s just that much worse for battery life or do I have questionable hardware? Is there any easy way to troubleshoot (can Xcode be used to measure usage)?\n\nA: It's anecdotal, but John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) who tends to get a lot of feedback from Apple users, suggested on Twitter that it's a problem for some non-zero percentage of users:\n\n\nAnd my iPhone 4S's battery lasts HALF a day, where the 4's battery lasted 1,5 days\n\n@JMoVS I know you're not alone, that other 4S users are seeing short battery life, but that's not normal. Mine lasts as long or longer.\n\nSo it sounds like you may have got a dud. If your battery life is substantially worse than a 3GS, it may be worthwhile asking to have your unit swapped for a fresh one.\n\nA: Every time there's a new iPhone, a certain subset of people immediately claim that the new one's battery life is way worse than the old one. Fact: every iPhone's battery has been better than the one preceding it. Not saying your problem isn't real - it probably is - but one of two things is causing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*a software issue\n\n*a defective battery specifically in your phone\n\n\nSince no one here can help you with 2., we're all going to suggest the basics that Apple helpfully already summarized for us: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html\nAnd I'd add that any battery-draining issues in iOS 5.0 are probably going to be fixed in the inevitable version to follow.\n\nA: So it sounds like this is likely a known issue, as described by this article in the UK Guardian.\nIn case anyone else comes across this and is curious about some of the symptoms I've seen, here is a bit of info that might be useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had my phone go from 90% charge to 60% charge in 90 minutes while in airplane mode and without using the phone (no apps running, no location services being used, no iPod usage).\n\n*The phone gets quite warm when the battery is draining. Much more so than I experience when doing anything else. Given the behavior, I'd guess that it gets into some mode where an app gets out of control and is fully pegging the CPU, even though as far as can be determined, nothing is/should be running.\n\n*This may be a red herring, but my phone won't sync. I don't know if this is related, but doing either a restore or trying to sync with iTunes while connected to a MBP fails. I can only get things to work with \"Transfer Purchases\". I sync fine with my iPad running iOS5, so I don't think the problem is on the iTunes side. This may be an unrelated problem (though I hope it isn't as there is a chance I'll get a fix for the battery problem).\n\n\nHope this helps others who run into a similar problem and are trying to troubleshoot it. I think the easiest way of testing is using airplane mode and making sure location services are not running and if you are still seeing rapid battery drain, there is no good reason that should be happening in that mode, no matter how you have your phone set up.\nNOTE: And now confirmed by Apple.\n", "Q: How to see what apps you have bought after doing a clean install How can I get my apps back after a clean install if I bought all of them directly on my iDevice and never bothered to sync them to my computer?\nBackground: I lost all of my apps on my ipad when I updated (10/22/11) they were all gone. \n\nA: On your iPad log into the AppStore with the Apple ID you used to purchase the Apps. Then go to the Purchased tab and select them to be downloaded again.\n\nIf you did not make a backup, which iTunes would have asked you to do before upgrading, you will lose all your data however.\nYou can also do this from iTunes by logging into the AppStore and clicking on Purchased and then selecting Apps under purchased:\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the App Store app\n\n*Go to the 'Purchased' tab\n\n*Download the ones you need again\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4 Restore When I upgraded to the new iOS 5 last week, I noticed that iTunes made a backup before installing, and then did a \"restore\".  I realized that a lot of events in my iCal were missing, and so I tried doing a restore.  I didn't realize that this restore was from when I first synced the phone over a year ago!, and that I am missing all of my photos and videos.  Now, when I try to find a backup from last week, I can't.  I looked in the Library/Application Data/MobileSync/Backup, but there only seems to be older backups there.  (I look at the info.plist file, and it verifies that these are backups from 2010)  Is there any way that I can find the backup from last week?  I'm proficient in the command line.  Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: No. iTunes performs two different types of backups. One is used to carry over information during a major update (as in the move to iOS 4 to iOS 5). This backup is only stored and used for this brief period of time; think of it as a temporary backup to serve a singular purpose.\nThe other is a permanent backup that can be deployed so long as you hold onto it. These backups are listed in the iTunes preference window:\n\nAs for trying to recover the backup, there is no way to do this because frankly, there are no files to recover. Even trying to use 3rd party disk recovery utilities on permanent backups would be futile because the backups aren't stored in a singular file, but rather littered through a thousand of them, each uniquely carrying an identifier. Something a recovery suite could never effectively retrieve.\nSadly, you have lost it all. The only option would be to jailbreak and perhaps run a recovery utility on your phone's filesystem. I've never done or heard of it being done, so you would likely be in uncharted waters.\nFor the future, it's always a good idea to right click on your device as it's listed in the iTunes sidebar, right click and selected Backup from the context menu before any major update. Additionally, iTunes will create its own permanent backups periodically, so it's also a good idea to sync more often than you've been syncing your device.\n", "Q: Airport Extreme + USB Drive vs Time Capsule The price between an airport extreme and 2TB Time Capsule is quite a lot (£100) and as far as I can see the only different is that the Time Capsule has a hard drive built in. \nIs there any problems with buying an airport extreme and a (£70) 2TB USB hard drive and just plugging it in to the back? Will I still be able to use Time machine? And will I be able (like my last question) be able to use the same drive for windows backup?\n(I'm not sure why Apple would charge so much more if you can use them separately?)\n\nA: According to Apple, Airport Extreme with attached disk is not supported for Time Machine. It might work, sometimes, but with a backup system, people usually want more than \"might work sometimes\".\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2038\n\n*http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/15139.html\n\n*http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.7/en/mh15139.html\n\nA: If you attach a USB drive to an Extreme, you can access that drive as a \"mapped network drive\" in Windows (right-click Network).   Once mapped, it is just like any other drive, and your backup program should be able to read/write it.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set multiple artists for one song? I have an album that contains many songs, some of which are performed by several artists.\nI do want all the songs to appear under one album in the albums, and when I am browsing by artists, so under each artist I should see this album and the songs he participated.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set more than one artist on a song?\n\n*How do I make it appear in the library the way I described above.\n\n\nA: There is no easy way to do this, you only have one artist field per track.\nWhat you could do is listing the name of all artists in the artist field and then create smart playlists with rules for \"Artist contains\".\n\nA: To add other artists, use ; separator or / between artists. (Artist1; Artist2; Artist3; Artist4 or Artist1/Artist2/Artist3/Artist4)\n I tried this in my iPod (Shuffle 3rd)\nExample:\n I have \"On The Floor\" song. This song have 2 artists. It is Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull.\n On the artist field, type Jennifer Lopez; Pitbull. Then if you want to add a smart playlist contain Pitbull, use 'Artist contains' and fill the box with 'Pitbull'. Then it will show songs with Pitbull artist.\nThis is the example:\n\non the image above, on the floor is listed with my other Pitbull songs but still shows the other artist (Jennifer Lopez)\n\nA: You need to set \"Album Artist” to whatever artist you want to use.  Then it’ll group like you want it.  You get to “Album Artist” from GetInfo -> Info   \n\nA: instead of using (artist; artist) or (artist/artist) you can also simply use (artist & artist) but it still doesn't fully do what you want it to do.\n", "Q: Mouse cursor jittery when hover state on browsers in OS X Lion I recently upgraded to OS X Lion from Snow Leopard. One bug I've found is that in browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera), when you hover over any link, the cursor doesn't only change, it jitters around for a second before changing.\nSince the bug is annoying but difficult to explain, I tried to make a short clip of it. This is weird: it doesn't show up on video when recorded with various screen recording softwares. How odd.\nIt's driving me nuts. Does anyone have a fix for this, or have experienced this problem?\nI'm using:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 2010\n\n*Trackpad\n\n*All web browsers\n\n*Hovering over links\nQuickly\n\n\nA: Since this seems to persist, you might need to perform some more troubleshooting to narrow it down:\n\n\n*\n\n*Test by creating an entirely new user account on the Mac with the problem and see if the issue is repeatable.\n\n*Log when and where the issue happens (assuming it's not a 100% guaranteed item that you can make happen any time you want in 5 seconds of setup).\n\n*Install a clean OS onto an external USB drive and see if that setup has the issue.\n\n*File a bug or work with Apple to isolate the issue further.\n\n\nThe clue that the screen recording is clear, but the artifact is visual seems like a great thing to capture with a video recording of the screen and a simultaneous camera recording of the image from the screen. The frequency and placement of the issue might be enough for someone else to diagnose a likely culprit.\n", "Q: Where do I start with re-installing OSX on my 2008 MacBook? I'm in kind of a mess. I have a 2008 MacBook (White) and I tried to re-install the OS. I wiped the HDD as part of the re-install process but the install failed and said the disc is scratched.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a copy of Leopard that came with the MacBook. However it fails checksums.\n\n*I have an upgrade copy of Snow Leopard on DVD. (Unsurprisingly?) the MacBook won't install from it.\n\n*I have a full copy of Snow Leopard for Mac Mini - I tried to install and it says it doesn't work on MacBooks.\n\n*I have a new MacBook Air with Lion preinstalled.\n\n\nIs there something I can do to reinstall Something on my MacBook?\nI know the last resort is to suck it up and buy Lion on USB, but I was wondering if there are some alternatives that avoid that.\n\nA: *\n\n*I have a copy of Leopard that came with the MacBook. However it fails\nchecksums.\n\n\nYou can try to repair the disc using this method. Never done it but the author claims he has, and it worked for him. Your mileage may vary.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an upgrade copy of Snow Leopard on DVD. (Unsurprisingly?) the\nMacBook won't install from it.\n\n\nYou seem to have bad luck with physical media. From this source (and Diago below), the Snow Leopard upgrade disc contains a full installer, allowing the installation even over a system without any OS whatsoever. If it fails to boot, it could likely be damaged.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a full copy of Snow Leopard for Mac Mini - I tried to install\nand it says it doesn't work on MacBooks.\n\n\nThat is also correct. Minis (like many of the machines Apple manufacturers) come with their own specific versions of OS X. The Mac minis, like the MacBook Airs ship with special versions that differ from the ones you purchase through other channels. Therefore, you cannot use an installation disc from a MacBook Pro on a MacBook or iMac.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a new MacBook Air with Lion preinstalled.\n\n\nApple machines that ship with Lion cannot be transferred to other devices. If you purchases Lion through the Mac App Store, you could install it on any Mac (except those that ship with them of course).\nIn all honesty, the best advice I could give you is to book an appointment at one of your local Apple Stores and speak to a Genius. Tell them your situation (bring in the machine and the Tiger installation disc). They'll either give you a Snow Leopard installation for free or boost you up to Lion. I'm not sure if they will give you a free USB Stick, but they'll do something for you. I guarantee that. \n\nA: Do you still have the Mac mini? If so, boot it from its install disk and connect the MacBook to it in Target Firewire mode. (Hold the T key at the chime and then connect a firewire cable between the two devices.) Select the MacBook's hard drive as the destination for the install.\nDepending on the version of 10.6 it installs, you may have to then boot the mini from the MacBook's hard drive (still in Target Firewire mode) and run software updates for the MacBook to run properly.\nEven if the above fails, you could probably then use the 10.6 update DVD you have to reinstall 10.6 properly on the MacBook itself.\n", "Q: How can I rename a song in iTunes with a keyboard shortcut? I can hit the up and down arrows to navigate a playlist in iTunes 10.5 but hitting F2 doesn't allow me to rename a song.  I have to grab the mouse and do a finicky click, wait, click to highlight the song and then rename it.  Can I just assign F2 to this?  Or can I use an existing keyboard shortcut?\nIncidentally, I know I can hit Command-I, and then Command-2, tab to Name, change the name, and hit Return, but this sub-optimal.\nBonus points if you can explain how I would assign such a shortcut to highlight the Genre of a song, which is my more common use case (long story).\n\nA: *\n\n*Press ↑ Up or ↓ Down to go to the track in iTunes.\n\n*Press ⌘ cmd + ↩ return.\n\nThe track name will now highlight and become ready to edit\n\n*Enter the text of the title.\n\n\n*Press ↩ return to commit the renaming of the track.\n\nI made a page of this (with pictures) at: http://sites.google.com/site/chrislent/home/rename-a-track-in-itunes-from-the-keyboard\nSee Apple KB Article PH12110 for an exhaustive list of keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: fn + return works while navigating with the up and down keys.\nEdit the song, then press return again to submit changes. \nFor the other columns just press tab to reach the desired column.\n", "Q: How can I turn off push notifications for individual apps in iOS 5? When an app is first installed, occasionally it asks if you would like to receive push notifications for that app. Normally I click 'No' and never think about it again. But yesterday, I accidentally clicked 'Yes', and would now like to turn push off for that app so as to save battery life.\nIf I go to notifications in the settings app, I can easily change the type of notification to 'None', however is this actually disabling push, or just hiding the notification?\nSome of the apps that I am pretty sure I clicked 'No' to push notifications have this setting set to 'Banner' - making me think that these settings aren't related to whether push is turned on or off for that app. \n\nWhat is the correct way to enable/disable push after initially selecting an option on app installation? Are the notifications settings related to push?\n\nA: You need to turn all 5 setting off for that app in Settings ->Notifications\nTurning Notification Center off only removes that app from the Notification Center (swipe down from the top of the screen).  It doesn't turn off alerts, badges, sounds or the lock screen. \n\nA: Under Settings, go to Notifications\nSelect Alert Style: NONE\nTurn off SOUNDS\nTurn off VIEW IN LOCK SCREEN\n\nA: The original question (asked by Jordan, I believe) has a comment that indicates there may be confusion between Push Notifications and Email Notifications. \nHe mentioned not wanting to get so many email messages about activity in his apps. All of these answers are just for Push Notifications (which are pop-ups on your device), but even if you manage to turn those off, you'll still get the loads of email notifications. \nSome apps, like Pinterest, do not have a place in the mobile app settings to control Email Notifications. You have to login to the app online to access the full settings and turn the Email Notifications off. \nThen your inbox will stop filling up!\n\nA: There is no way to disable push notifications. They are handled by Apple's servers and will be sent to your device even if you uninstall the program. \nDisabling all the app's respective settings under the Notification Center will only hide them. Refer to Apple's developer Push documentation for more details.\n\nSpecifically, look at the Apple Push Notification (APN) Service, which \"transports and routes a notification from a given provider to a given device.\" Apple says the following about the APN:\n\nSometimes APNs might attempt to deliver notifications for an application on a device, but the device may repeatedly refuse delivery because there is no target application. This often happens when the user has uninstalled the application. In these cases, APNs informs the provider through a feedback service that the provider connects with. The feedback service maintains a list of devices per application for which there were recent, repeated failed attempts to deliver notifications. The provider should obtain this list of devices and stop sending notifications to them.\n\n—Source\nIn short, Push notifications are handled outside of the device. To stop them, once a program has been installed, means the developer of the program must remove your device from the list (or the notification must fail enough for the APN to stop sending them entirely). As a user, there is not way to \"stop\" them, just hide them from within iOS.\n\nA: Uninstall and reinstall and when the prompt appears about notifications, click \"No\".  Your first choice is absolute.\n\nA: Apple seems to support the theory that disabling the various notification settings will disable push for that app. \n\"Turn off push notifications: Some applications from the App Store use the Apple Push Notification service to alert you of new data. Applications that extensively rely on push notifications (such as instant messaging applications) may impact battery life. To disable push notifications, go to Settings > Notifications and disable notifications for select applications. Note that this does not prevent new data from being received when the application is opened. Also, the Notifications setting will not be visible if you do not have any applications installed that support push notifications.\"\nhttp://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html\n\nA: When you disable all notifications for a specific app (alerts,badges, etc) you also disable \"push\" so data will only be received when you open the app. I verified this with whatsapp.\n\nA: Settings -> Notifications -> turn on/off (for apps you want to change it)\n\nA: The APNS servers seem to keep a list of enabled push notifications for a device, so at least theoretically, they could filter out everything that is not enabled on a particular device to conserve energy.\nI've verified this by observing the traffic patterns on the APNS socket from an iOS 7 device to Apple's push notification servers while modifying the notification settings of an installed app.\nThe following settings cause traffic to be sent to Apple when toggled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Badge app icons\n\n*Sounds\n\n*Banners/Alerts\n\n\nAs long as one of those three is enabled, changes to the remaining two don't cause messages to be sent on the connection, so presumably there is a binary state (interested/not interested) stored on the server, and the details are handled on the device.\nChanging the settings for the notification area, switching between banners and alerts, and the settings for the lock screen also seem to be handled locally.\nAdditionally, when the application is uninstalled, the push servers also seem to be notified.\n", "Q: Can I purchase from other sites using my Apple ID? Is it possible to purchase from other sites using my Apple ID account like paypal; to pay for items on sites other than the iTunes store?\nHow would this be done technically? I have came up with a few possible solutions but doubt them. Would Apple even allow this?\n\nA: Short answer is: no. iTunes accounts are meant for purchasing products from Apple, and Apple only.\nApple might decide at some point to partner with other companies to allow you to reuse your account on other websites, but I don't think it has done so so far. Besides, iTunes is an online store, not a payment service like Paypal.\n", "Q: Optical out does not work on my new 2011 Mac Mini I use the optical out on my new Mac Mini to play high quality music over a separate D/A converter and a class A amplifier. This worked fine with the previous Mac Mini revision.\nNow, when I connect the most recent mac Mini with HDMI to a TV set (for watching movies) and at the same time connect optical out for music, the music channel is dead. The read line on the optical cable is on, but the D/A does not receive any signal?\nThe selection in the system preferences for Audio can be toggled between HDMI and optical out, but does not give any result.\nThe only option I now have is to use the headphone out with an analog signal into my amplifier, but with a loss of quality.\n\nA: New macs have 90 days of free phone and online support. Do get the hardware checked out since the optical switch in the port could be faulty or need cleaning from shipping debris.\n\nA: Does the optical out work when the HDMI is not connected to a TV, or not plugged in at all? If so then this may be a DRM limitation of some kind where HDMI and optical out cannot work at the same time.\nIf the optical out doesn't work when HDMI is not in use either you probably have a hardware issue. Visit an apple store or other apple authorised repair outlet.\n", "Q: How can I manually change default applications in OS X? I'm facing an issue with Transmission's \"Set Default Application\" button - it seems to do nothing. Magnet links still don't work, so this feature is broken for me. I have been able to use Magnet links with uTorrent prior to switching to Transmission, so I know there's no issue there.\nIs there an app or any manual way to set/change protocol associations without having to use the target application to set it?\nI'm using Transmission 2.42 (13013) running on OS X Lion 10.7.2.\n\nA: RCDefaultApp is a Preferences Panel which allows you to edit the default application used for various URL schemes, file extensions, file types and MIME types.\n\n", "Q: What is the point of syncing with iTunes if I have Google Apps, iCloud and no media? On my iPhone and iPad I use Google Apps for syncing mail, calendar and contacts. \nWith iOS 5 I now use iCloud for backup (and for syncing Reminders, Bookmarks and Find my iPhone, none of which I really use).\nI have no media (music, video or photos) that needs to be synced with the iPhone.\nOut of habit, I still sync with iTunes (over Wi-Fi now), but I am starting to question why.\nIn my setup, is there any reason to sync? Backup seems to happen anyway, and Google Apps sync independently and immediately anyway.\nI sync apps in iTunes, but I fail to see the point of it, since I can now download any app I am missing right on the iPhone.\nIs there any reason to keep syncing with iTunes? Are there any bad consequences of completely giving it up?\nThe one thing I can think of is iOS updates. Will I still need iTunes for those?\n\nA: OS updates will now happen over the air. The only reasons would be to sync a new iPhoto event/album or to sync content that you added manually (ripped CD). \nBut outside of that, iOS doesn't require syncing.\n\nA: Not everything will be restored and iTunes restoring will be much faster.\nAccording to https://www.apple.com/icloud/features/apps-books-backup.html and https://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766\n\nPrevious purchases may not be restored if they are no longer in the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBookstore\n\nAnd some problems (and successes) are discussed here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/16498054#16498054\n\nA: If a stupid tragic accident happened to your iPod/iPhone/iPad and get another iPod/iPhone/iPad and you happened to sync then you can get all your data back again.\n\nA: I've restored from an iCloud backup before, even data in third-party apps were restored. But any apps no longer avaible in the app store will not be restored as app binaries are not backed up by iCloud. But you can always backup locally to the Mac/PC once in a while for the peace of mind.\nIf you sync your apps with iTunes, you get the ability to rearrange apps and app pages in iTunes. You can also download app updates with iTunes first then sync to both your devices later. \nUpdating more than a few apps on iDevices can be slow and unreliable. A lot of times large apps (100MB-1GB+) get stuck downloading, and they'll keep the rest of your download queue from downloading and you can't even run those other apps because of the empty download bar and you basically have to reset. And even after you reset, the partial download of the large app with remain in the temp storage (it'll show up as \"Other\" in your storage usage map in iTunes). The only official way to clear those \"Other\" storage is do a restore. I myself have PhoneView, so I went into the iDevice and delete those files myself when a couple partially downloaded games took up over 2GB. There are people see it blow up to 5-6GB. Normal \"Other\" usage should be around 1GB.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3374375?start=0&tstart=0\nAlso, be careful when you turn of App sync, it'll ask you if you want to keep apps on your iDevices, click \"Keep\" or it may remove all your third-party apps and data on the iDevice and have to restore from a most recent backup.\nThat said, I use iCloud for backup and sync. As a general safety measure, I always perform a local backup in iTunes before I switch any iCloud sync options to/from iTunes.\n\nA: One reason for doing multiple backups is that one can go wrong and also for the cloud your accounts can get messed up due to errors or other people getting your accounts for example see this example of a person having all his Apple, Google and Amazon data being destroyed.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of Newsstand? After the upgrade to iOS-5, I got the Newsstand app \"for free\". I don't use it and I probably never will. Is there any way, short of jail breaking, for me to remove it from my iPad2?\nI know that I can put it in a folder, but can I remove it entirely?\n\nA: No. Like all iOS applications coming pre-installed, Newsstand cannot be removed from an iOS device.

I have tried simply renaming the file thus (disregarding the 4 KB .mds file):\nvideo.mdf --> video.iso.\nThis sort of worked. Most of the video played perfectly (in VLC) but then the final three minutes were silent with a blank screen.\nHow should I go about doing this?\n\nA: You can use very simple command line program mdf2iso for this.\nit is available via MacPorts (for example).\nPS: This utility can be also used in any Linux, *BSD and Windows systems\n\nA: Handbrake is able to read quite a lot of video formats. It shares a bunch of libraries with VLC anyway so you may be able to convert your files as well. \n\nA: Another way, if you only need to mount the image, is to use DAMON Tools for Mac. Not free but if the trial expires it can be uninstalled/reinstalled using AppCleaner.\n", "Q: My MacBook's external monitor is magnified When I initially got my MacBook, I connected my external monitor and it worked fine. Last night I disconnected it and when I connected them back together, the resolution on the external monitor was changed. The overall display is now magnified (for example as I'm writing this I have to scroll down to see this). \nI tried to change the resolution settings in Preferences but this didn't help to change it back. So how can I set the resolution of the external monitor back to a sane state?\n\nA: In System Preferences, select Displays. On each running display (i.e. both on the external monitor and the MacBook itself, should it be open) a list of supported resolutions will be displayed. Click \"Detect Displays\" on the dialog shown on the external monitor. This should make the system recognize the kind of display and the supported resolutions. You should then be able to change between these without problem.\n\nA: Maybe you accidentally magnified your screen using Universal Access's screen Zoom, it can survive display detects with out zooming back out. And it can be accidentially triggered via holding down the ⌘ key or some customizable key and then scrolling up or down with your mouse or track pad. \n\n\n*\n\n*Look in System Preferences under the \"Univeral Access\" section.  \n\n*Once there click on the \"Seeing\" tab. Is \"Zoom:\" on? If yes then continue. \n\n*Press ⌘ + ⌥ + - to zoom out.\n\nA: I just had this problem on High Sierra 10.13.4 on my 2015 Retina Macbook.

A Safari extension could be written to add an item to the Toolbar or to a context menu, although not to the menubar. Writing that extension would be a developer question beyond the scope of this site.\nAn automator service that calls an AppleScript to save the current page as PDF could be added to the Safari menu (not the File menu) and assigned a keyboard shortcut.\nAs far as I am aware, however, adding a command to the File menu is not possible through the standard (i.e. supported) extension mechanism, and would require hacking the Safari binaries.\n", "Q: How can I wirelessly transfer photos from my iPhone to my computer without using Photostream? Sometimes I take a quick photo with my iPhone's camera and I need to get it onto my iMac.\nI'd love to do this wirelessly (like syncing and everything else).\nI'm aware that iCloud's Photostream should allow me to do this, but I don't have a new enough version of iPhoto to access it. I really never use iPhoto, so it's hard to justify an upgrade.\nWhen I connect my phone to the computer with USB, there are a number of quick ways to get photos off of it. Image Capture, Preview, iPhoto, etc. But, none of those options are available via WiFi or Bluetooth.\nIs there a way to transfer photos from my iPhone to my iMac wirelessly and without using Photostream?\nIdeally, Image Capture and/or Preview would see the phone as a networked camera.\n\nA: You could use an iPhone app like WiFi Photo Transfer (There are a few of those available in the app store), but I don't think this is going to be any more convenient than simply plugging your phone in.\nAnother way would be to take the photos with Dropbox. The Dropbox iPhone app let's you take phones, which would just appear in your Dropbox folder on your Mac.\n\nA: Requirements: iOS 5 and iTunes 10.5\niOS 5 and iTunes 10.5 support wireless sync, you need to connect your phone via USB, check \"Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi\".\nThen go to the \"Photos\" tab\nAnd choose to sync either iPhoto albums or Pictures folder (or any other custom folder).\nEach time you want to sync photos you'll need to just press \"Sync\"\n\nA: *\n\n*Download Bump from the App Store.\n\n*Go to https://bu.mp/\n\n*Select your photos from in the bump app (from the camera roll or photo library).\n\n*Press your phone into the spacebar of your Mac.\n\n*Press connect on the website and on your phone \n\n*You can then use the download or download all buttons on the website or drag and drop.\n\n\nEDIT: As pointed out in the comments, bump is no longer around annoyingly. I know use DeskConnect, which is just as quick as bump, and has the advantage that you don't have to physically move either device, nor do you need to have them both at the same time in the same place.\nHowever it doesn't have a web client, so you need to install the software on your computer.\n\nA: I have Printopia on my Mac.  So from my iPhone, when I have a photo showing, and then print it, one of the choice of Airprint printer is \"Send to Dropbox on Mac\" and another is just \"Send to Mac\" (which--surprising to me--opened itself immediately in Photoshop, probably because that is my default app for jpegs).  Even (iOS5) send multiple photos at a time.\n\nA: If you have the Developer tools, you will have Printer Simulator.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Printer Simulator (just type it into the spotlight search box).\n\n*Then on you iPhone you can select the photos you want Choose share\nand then print. \n\n*Chose the save original \"printer\". \n\n*A few seconds after pressing print they will open in Preview on your Mac.\n\n\nIf you have a lot of photos to transfer, you can save yourself having to save each photo in Preview, by changing the save location in the Printer Simulator Preferences.\n\nA: The simplest way is to use the app \"transfr\". You can send your photos or videos from your iphone to your mac or the other way round. \nExtremely user friendly too.\n\nA: On the Apps tab of the iTunes window - where you see all the apps on all the screens of your phone - way down the bottom, you'll find a list of apps that can transfer files to and from the computer. Even on wifi.\nOne of those apps is iPhoto. You do need iPhoto installed on the phone, and you need to save the images from your camera roll in iPhoto.\nThe process is a bit cumbersome - an applescript wizard could whip up something, though - but it gets the task done and sure saves looking for a cable.\n\nA: I used iAny Manager\nIt can help copy photos from computer to iPhone, also able to transfer photos from iPhone to computer. \n", "Q: What is the macOS equivalent to Window's AppData folder?

For example, if I do:\n$ open ssh://machine.example.com\n\nThen it will spawn a new SSH session in terminal. I'd like these to be opened in iTerm2 instead. How do I tell macOS to use iTerm2 to handle ssh:// URLs instead of Terminal?\n\nA: iTerm2 can set itself as the default SSH handler. In its preferences, go to “Profiles”. Create a profile to handle SSH sessions, or select an existing one. In the “General” section, bottom right, you can select which URL scheme this profile should handle:\n\nSelect SSH. iTerm2 will ask if it is to set itself up as the default SSH handler:\n\nConfirm and you are done. Happy remoting.\n\nA: Make sure you dragged the iTerm2 app in the Applications folder.  If you set iTerm2 to be the SSH terminal handler it will not save nor use it. It appears that when you invoke the handler it only looks in Applications. If it doesn't find it there it will default to the system handler. I was running it from Downloads and it would never save the SSH handler.

I told Pages to learn the spelling of a character name I was writing about, without noticing there was a misspelling in the name. \nIs there anyway to delete or correct the spelling of the name from the Dictionary now that I added it by mistake?\n\nA: Right click on the misspelled word and select “Unlearn Spelling”.\nAs Pages uses OS X’ global spelling services,  you can use this method anywhere text input is spell checked by it (more or less any text area, with the notable exceptions of MS Office, OpenOffice / LibreOffice, Firefox and a few other apps ported from the non OS X world). \nIf a misspelled word is not underlined in red and the “Unlearn Spelling” option is missing from the context menu, it may be that you originally used “Ignore Spellin” rather than “Learn Spelling”. In that case, try opening a new document and pasting in the misspelled word – the red underline will appear in the new document if you ignored the spelling in the original document.\n\nA: The spelling dictionaries are stored as plain text files in ~/Library/Spelling/. They can be edited directly, but the changes aren't always applied until AppleSpell.service is reopened.\n", "Q: Open iTerm2 SSH session in new window instead of new tab Now that I figured out how to set iTerm2 as the ssh:// URL handler, I'd like iTerm2 to respond to an ssh URL by opening a new window instead of opening a new tab in an existing window. Is this possible?\n\nA: I was curious about the same problem. After reviewing the source code, I found in iTerm2 v1.0.0.20111020 is hard-coded to open a new session as a tab if a session already exists, when it receives nearly any \"launch this URL with a handler\" command.\nMy Xcode and Objective-C skills are still rather weak, but if you want to give it a shot I believe the problem is related to the source file iTermController.m. On lines 789 to 870 the launchBookmark:withURL method has the following code:\n// Where do we execute this command?\nBOOL toggle = NO;\nif (theTerm == nil) {\n    [iTermController switchToSpaceInBookmark:aDict];\n    term = [[[PseudoTerminal alloc] initWithSmartLayout:YES\n                                             windowType:[aDict objectForKey:KEY_WINDOW_TYPE] ?

Perhaps you can modify the code to force the first block to always run, regardless of theTerm's contents.\nI hope this helps!! .. It may be worth filing a bug report or contacting the author if you're still having problems.\n", "Q: Is there an iMessage client for OS X? Apple's new iMessage sends messages between accounts associated designated e-mail addresses (as well as certain phone numbers). Apple's iChat also sends messages between accounts associated designated e-mail addresses. For the most part, for example if one uses the default iCloud settings, these e-mail addresses are the same. Yet, as near as I can tell, iMessages only work between iOS devices and iChats only work between OS X machines (or machines running specific chat clients). \nIf this is correct, is there a way to get around this limitation using an iMessage client for OS X, or is it possible to configure iChat as an iMessage client?\n\nA: Currently no. In the future it's possible that Apple would come out with an iMessage client, or an add-on for iChat to integrate it (Lion's iChat now includes a plugin system), but at the moment it's a closed Apple system and they haven't provided any access for OS X.\n\nA: Apple has just announced OSX Mountain Lion which incorporates iMessage into the OS in the form of the Messages app. This will work in the same was as iMessage for iOS.\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/\nYou can currently download the messages beta free from Apple here\n", "Q: How can I reduce the time it takes to sync my ipod touch I have a 64 GB ipod touch with about:\n\n\n*\n\n*20 GB of music on my external hard drive\n\n*20 GB of photos on my external hard drive\n\n*About 50 apps\n\n\nIt now seems to take over 40 minutes for my ipod-touch to do a full sync regardless if there is anything new or not (pics, etc) to sync\n\n\n*\n\n*How can i find out what is taking so long?

When I send an iMessage from my phone, it appears to come from the phone number for that phone, and as a result, when it is replied to, the replies (and the conversation) appear only on the phone; but when I send an iMessage from an iPad, the message appears to come from an e-mail address, and as a result, the conversation is replicated across all iOS devices using that e-mail address.\nI may not have that quite right (it requires some cooperation to test, and I can find no documentation that confirms it) but if I do:\nIs there a way to \"force\" an iMessage to \"come from\" an e-mail address rather than from a phone number, so that I can ensure that a conversation is synced across my iOS devices?\n\nA: Yes, under Settings -> Messages -> Receive At -> Caller ID you can set the phone number or email address you want your messages to appear to come from.\nYou can also do this with FaceTime as well.\n", "Q: Air 11\" i7 2011 fans come on, never turn off I bought a new MBA 11\" i7, it's about two weeks old.\nI've noticed that as soon as the fans come on, they Never turn off. If I watch a video, or do any slightly heavy lifting, the CPU hits 70C, the fans come on at +6000rpm and never turn off.\nEven if the CPU load is less than 1% for an hour or more, the fans stay on full-blast and the CPU temp stays at ~67C and the case at ~35C.\nThe room is normal temperature, it's sitting on a desk.\nThe only way I've found of making the fans turn off is to make the Mac sleep for a while.\nIs this a known issue? Are other people having similar problems? What can I do to resolve this?\n\nA: The fans are controlled by the System Management Controller (SMC).\nThe first thing to try when troubleshooting a fan issue is resetting that SMC. In fact, Apple says this:\n\nAfter performing normal troubleshooting, these symptoms may indicate\n  that an SMC reset may be necessary: [...] The computer's fans run at high speed although the computer is\n  not experiencing heavy usage and is properly ventilated.\n\nApple has directions for all models, but I'll excerpt how to do it on your MacBook Air:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down the computer.\n  \n*Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to    the Mac if its not already connected.\n  \n*On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option    keys and the power button at the same time.\n  \n*Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n  \n*Press the power button to turn on the computer.\n  \n\nOne other thing you can try is the app smcFanControl, which claims to allow you to exercise some degree of control over your computer's fans.\nThis is about all you can do as a consumer; if there is still a problem you will need to take your computer to an Apple Store.\n", "Q: iPhone can send iMessages without a SIM card?

The 'disk' space in iCloud is not like the iDisk option in MobileMe. Since iOS doesn't really expose its file system, they don't map this to the Mac in a 'mountable' way. \nSo currently, the only way to access iCloud data would be through APIs. \n", "Q: How to find the location of the items I created in iTunes?

I have a 2007 Mac Pro with a 3-disk RAID0 bootdrive.\nI want to do a clean Lion install on the RAID volume but I'm not sure if there are any known issues with doing this. I seem to remember that last time I did something like this the installer crapped-out when it encountered the RAID. I got round this by doing a clean install on a different (single) drive, backing it up and then reinstalling it onto the RAID volume. Quite painful.\nI understand that I'll have to create the Recovery HD on an external drive but this aside, does anyone have any knowledge they can share? I'm hoping that the lack of info online means that its perfectly fine and I'm worrying unduly ;-)\nThanks.\n\nA: I think you should be fine. I upgraded to Lion on a Mac Pro that has a RAID 0. While the OS is installed to an SSD, not RAID, Lion still detected the RAID just fine. That's obviously a different scenario than what you have, but as the software RAID is handled at a higher level than the OS, I think you should be fine.\nObviously, have a backup ready to go just in case, but my guess is that your upgrade should go smoothly.\n", "Q: USB port not functioning on a user account, works on another This is a 15\" MacBook Pro (Early 2011 model).\nIn one user account, only a single USB port works.

I've upgraded my system since 2007 (no clean installs). \nNow that I have Lion installed I was wondering if there are any historic files, plists etc. that I can remove as part of a general post-upgrade spring clean?\nAre there any other files I can safely remove?\n\nA: Unlike Windows, the system files for OS X are quite efficient in size and stable in structure, so I don't think you will find much opportunity there to free up disk space.  Preference files are relatively tiny and any system-level bundles were very likely deleted along with the entire folder.  \nWhere you will probably find the most \"junk\" is various caches and junk files left over from old applications.  Look in your ~/Library and ~/Library/Preferences folder and remove folders belonging to removed applications.\nThere is much more you can do, but rather than possibly screwing up your system, I suggest using utility software such as CleanMyMac.  I have freed up 44 GB according to that app.  \nBefore you do anything else, get GrandPerspective, so you can see what is actually using up space.\n", "Q: Set IP adress for the wifi hotspot on OSX If I share my ethernet over WiFi I would like to specify the IP address of the hotspot (for now it defaults to 10.0.2.1). Can this be set somewhere in system settings?\nNote: the ethernet is not connected. I just run a local web server that should be accessible by some clients connection to my hotspot (and therefore I should have a fix IP address).\n\nA: AFAICT, this is managed by the process com.apple.InternetSharing. When it is enabled, the file /etc/bootpd.plist is created. Here it has your IP address 10.0.2.1\nHowever, this file is deleted and recreated when Internet Sharing restarts, so modifying it is pointless. I bet that the defaults command can be used to set a new IP address, however defaults read and sudo defaults read do not cite anything related to \"com.apple.InternetSharing\".\nI know this isn't a complete answer, but if you find whatever is creating /etc/bootpd.plist you'll probably accomplish your goal.

Is it possible to circumvent that requirement by accessing the user's LAN (with the host iTunes machine) via the iOS VPN? What steps would you take to set this up?\n--UPDATE--\nI've been researching this for nearly another hour, and the sticking point seems to be Bonjour. The clearest description of the difficulties I've seen being in this Apple support discussion:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1549218?start=0&tstart=0\nObviously there are ways around this with various third-party VPN solutions, but as far as I can tell, all of those require some sort of software on the client side, whereas on iOS devices, built-in support is limited to L2TP, PPTP and IPSec, none of which seem able to pass Bonjour packets.\nIs there some way around this? Ideally, a solution would only require modifications on the home end of things, so you'd only need an iOS device on the remote end to make it work, but if you have a creative solution that involves a MacBook on the remote end and connecting the iOS device through that, I'd certainly be open to the idea.\n\nA: Not a full answer but as you seem to primarily look for hints and pointers:\nAccording to this MacOSXHints article from three years ago it seems to be possible to route Bonjour over VPN using OpenVPN or LogMeIn. This should (with some hacking and routing magic probably) at least allow WiFi syncing as long as you have computers (not iDevices) on both end of the VPN (and connect the iDevice to one of them).\n\nA: The problem you are experiencing also effects iTunes Library sharing and Remote Desktop.  A solution for all these things is to create a Bonjour Beacon.\nSee also:\nhttp://provideotech.org/bonjour-and-vpn-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-googling-and-love-simplicity/\nThese solutions are based on the computers in your LAN and work across existing VPN structures built in to OS X (PPTP and L2TP).\n", "Q: iOS 5 Reminders on weekdays only Is it possible to create repeating reminders for weekdays only?  I don't see this option, but I can't believe something so basic would be left off.\n\nA: Add Calendar event for weekdays only by selecting Every Week, then Custom, which will then allow you to click which days of the week you want.  Once select, M-F, it will confirm you selected every weekday.  It will then show up as Custom on your Calendar event.\n\nA: The only way to create custom reminder time is by Siri.  I managed to created an event to remind me every 3 days.  I haven't figure out how to create one on weekdays only.  In the mean time, I just create an alarm as above post suggested.\n\nA: How about creating a reminder on monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, and friday, with each one repeating weekly? You'll have to make five edits instead of just one whenever something changes, but maybe the event details won't change enough and this workaround will suffice.\n\nA: In Reminders.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Repeat\n\n*Select Weekly\n\n*Select Custom\n\n*Select the days, e.g. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday\n\n\nA: I already saw this answer, but this may help find that custom option it's not immediately obvious: On calendar, choose repeat.  In repeat chose custom, then choose weekly, then select Monday-Friday.   You'll see 5 check marks \nAnother example of custom use is to get a meeting for every selected day of the week and week of the month, say every 3rd Thursday.  Select custom repeat, choose monthly, then \"on the\" gives the default choice of a date, but click the arrow and you get the choice on the 1st, 2nd, etc Mon Tues etc\n\nA: If you have an iPhone 4S, or newer, ask Siri to create the reminder for weekdays.  She can do it.\n\n\n\nA: The easiest way to setup a weekday (Monday-Friday) reminder using the Reminders app for iOS is to open Siri as others have mentioned and say \"REMIND ME WEEKDAYS AT 2PM (whatever time you want obviously).\" \nSiri when then ask you what you want to be reminded about which is when you provide the title of your reminder.  \nAfter you confirm the reminder it will save and if done correctly you'll notice the reminder will say \"custom repeat\".\nIf you edit the reminder you will lose your custom repeat so do not make changes after creating the reminder with Siri.\nHope that helps!  \n\nA: I am an app developer working with Reminders, and this kind of this is possible on the underlying APIs. The Reminder app is quite bare bones in its functionality.  I think this is intentional.\nI realize this may not help your immediate situation, but the more I work with Reminders, the more I think that apple has intentionally made Reminders pretty basic, because they are hoping app developers will create the kind of functionality you are looking for, in custom apps.\nUnfortunately, at this stage not many developers seem to be taking up that challenge, each preferring do do reminders/timers/todo list in their own separate universes.\nWhat you want could be done, but someone would need to make an app to do it.\n\nA: In Mavericks, I found that there is an easy way to do this in iCal, but it's not obvious. Instead of selecting \"Every Day\" go to Custom, then select Weekly, and you'll see a list of the 7 weekdays. Choose \"Every 1 week(s) on:\" then click on MTWTF or any combination of days, and you're all set.\nIn fact, after you do this, it will say Custom...Every Weekday.\n\nA: Choose \"Custom\" in repeat section and choose the days of the week for your calendar.\n", "Q: Can I setup a single Sparsebundle in RAID 1? My goal is the following: use my iMac as a TimeMachine Server (under OS X Lion Server) to backup my MBP via the network.\nWhat I did is to choose, in the TimeMachine Server configuration, the internal drive (1TB) of the iMac as a target for the backup.\nHowever I would like to have redundancy, not for the whole iMac data, but for that backup.\nIf I backup the sparsebundle created on my iMac (using CCC for example), then I'll have to copy the entire content all the time.\nSo would it be possible to create a virtual RAID 1 drive whose two drives are two sparsebundles, one located on the iMac internal drive and the other one on an external drive.\nI think that would be a very interesting solution for what I want to do, and it would be possible to scale it for 3 drives.\n\nA: You can setup a RAID 1 mirror over FireWire and connect the internal/external drives. However, I wouldn't recommend it.\nFirst, you'll need the same size drives to do the mirror. Second, the speed of both drives will be limited by the type of connection to the external drive, so if its USB, the computer will run at USB speeds. If you are just using this iMac for backup, that may not be an issue, but it's still going to slow everything down.\nRAID mirroring is intended mostly for much faster eSATA connections, as that keeps everything at nearly native speeds. What I might recommend in your case is to buy an external RAID and use that for backup. That way you aren't locked in to the internal drive on the iMac, and you can always move it to a different computer if need be (especially in the event of a restore, as it'd be faster plugged directly in than over the network.\n\nA: Yes - the Disk Utility should allow you to erase both the internal drive and the external drive and allow them to be part of a RAID.\nIf I were doing this and wanted to preserve the data on the current Time Machine destination drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Time Machine server - disable any new backups to that drive\n\n*Use Disk Utility to move all the contents (restore) from the internal drive to the external drive.\n\n*Verify the backup worked - mount the bundle, count files, etc...\n\n*Learn and practice mirroring a RAID set using cheap USB drives and expendable data.\n\n*Set up the internal drive as a Mirrored RAID drive\n\n*Copy the data back to the internal drive.\n\n*Erase and join the external drive with no data to the internal drive.\n\n\nOnce the OS has mirrored the data (block by block) you can detach and re-attach the drive.\n\nAs you can see, it's possible but you might instead look to some backup software like CrashPlan or others to get incremental backups of the data. You can use CrashPlan between your own machines without needing to pay for hosted offsite storage.\n", "Q: Where is the video my sister sent to me on iMessage? I clicked save and can't find it I have an iPhone 3GS.  I just did the software update to iOS5.  My sister took a cute video of my kid and sent it to me on iMessage.  I tried to save it to my phone so I could upload it to the computer and/or facebook, and now I can't find it.  It is not in my camera roll or in my iCloud.\nSo the question is....where is the file and why can't i find it?\n\nA: Check in your 'Videos' app; it should be saved in there.\n", "Q: Stuck in a calendar on iPhone I have an iPhone 3G. How can I get out of one of Calendars on my iPhone.  It is stuck in an empty calendar and doesn't allow me to get out of it to add any new events.  I've tried backing out of the calendar program to no avail.  And I've restarted my phone, also to no avail.  Does anyone have a suggestion?\n\nA: *\n\n*Double tap the start button, and it will bring up a list of running programs.  \n\n*Press and hold one of them, and they will start to jiggle, and show an - icon in the upper left corner.\n\n*Find the calendar program, and tap the -.\n\n*Rinse and repeat for any other apps you're having trouble with.  I like to periodically go through the list and close down apps I'm not using/won't use for a while\n\n\nNOTE: Do this from the home screen. If you are in the app it won't appear in the queue of running apps.\n\nA: I had the same problem. However, when I did the double click, it brought up all open programs EXCEPT the calendar.  I had to manually shut off and power back on, then my calendar item I added was there with the changes I had made.\n\nA: This may suck, but try syncing through iTunes and manually removing the calendar, and re-adding it in an additional sync.\nFor future reference, iOS5 supports manual removal of Calendars. Unfortunately, only the iPhone 3GS and above are supported on iOS5. Good luck!\n", "Q: Are all pictogram fonts broken in Lion? Since I updated to Lion (Mac OS X 10.7.2) all pictogram fonts (Zapf Dingbats, Webdings et al.) seem to be broken.\nThe application I have tested are below.\nTextEdit\nZapf Dingbats and Webdings do not show up in the font menu. You can select it by selecting  :\n\nFormat > Show Fonts…\n\nOmniGraffle\nSelecting either Zapf Dingbats or Webdings has no effect.\nPixelmator\nSelecting either Zapf Dingbats or Webdings has no effect.\nBBEdit\nIt seems to work in BBEdit (and TextWrangler), these both have Cocoa text handling.\nI have tested this on a MacBook Pro and a Mac Pro running 10.7.2.\nFirstly, can someone confirm this is an issue for them and not just an artefact of the way I have installed Lion.\nSecondly, any solutions?\nUpdate\nI forgot to add that all front look fine in Font Book\nUpdate 2\nUnfortunately Chris' idea is no good (for my specific issue) as the character I require is the lighting bolt.\n\n\nA: I think the fonts are fine - I've just checked them in Font Book.\nI tried Text Edit, Pixelmator and Pages and they all do as you state. But, if you load Font Book and find the fonts they are visible and populated with \"dings\". Could it be that the codes are different due to using Unicode?\nTo get to Wingdings characters in the other apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Keyboard Preferences check \"Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar\".\n\n*In the menu bar these is now a new icon.\n\n*Click on the icon and select \"Show Character Viewer\".\n\n*Characters can then be cut and paste from the Character Viewer.\n\n\nA: As Chris Redman said, the fonts are fine.\nTo access the glyphs in this font, you'll need to use the Character Palette. \nFollow the directions he gave to show the Character Palette, then click on the Action button in the upper left corner of the window and choose Customize List…. Scroll down in the list and choose Dingbats, like shown in the image below:\n\nThen choose the Dingbats category in the main window, then choose the appropriate font in the popup menu in the center column. The lightning bolt is shown in the image below.\n\nAs you can see, the Unicode value of that glyph is U+F07E, which is way the heck out of the range that you're going to be able to reach with your keyboard alone.\nP.S. Both BBEdit and TextWrangler are Carbon-based apps. (Well, they could be hybrid, but the majority of the text-handling appears to be Carbon (HITextView?)).\n\nA: In apps that follow the unicode standard I think you should really not be able to type dingbats or webdings using the normal US keyboard layout (i.e. just change the font and type).  The essence of the standard is that you no longer map pictographs (or anything else) to latin but give them their own codepoints, e.g. in the Private Use Area for web/wingdings and in U+2700 onward for dingbats.  This ensures that the meaning of the text does not depend on the reader having a particular font active to translate the data.\nThe idea is that these characters should always be input via the Character Viewer or similar app (or a custom keyboard layout if you want to make one).\nNonetheless there is a large amount of legacy data which does map dingbats to Latin and fonts that reflect that are still in wide use.  Also it seems that some Apple apps like Pages are designed to let you create web/wingdings via the US keyboard layout (though copy/paste to other apps will likely result in Latin text).  Exactly how and why they do this I don't know.\n\nA: \"Follow the directions he gave to show the Character Palette...\"\nI came here as a result of a Google search on how to get these special characters to work. The above quote is maddening, as the link to the instructions loops back around to this thread. \nFor for people looking for a direct answer, in TextEdit, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Edit menu.\n\n*Select Special Characters from the drop-down menu.\n\n*Select the symbol you want, then drag to the text area. Done. Enjoy life. \n\n", "Q: List movies as text in iPad 2 native video application, no preview graphic I would like to see more of my video titles on the same screen using iPad 2's native \"Videos\" app.  But the video summary page wastes space by showing a rectangle preview of each video.  Is there a way to list iPad 2 movies in a table containing just title and other textual data about the movie?  \nThe iPhone displays videos as a table of titles and other info, without any graphic of a video preview.  Can I get the table of titles on the iPad?\n\nA: Eventually I solved this problem using an application called \"File Browser.\"  Instead of sending files to the Video section of iTunes, use the App File Sync feature of iTunes to send the files to File Browser.  Note that other file utility apps should work as well too, not just the one I use (called File Browser).  \nAfter moving the files to the file app, you can browse the files from the app.  File Browser will start video files using the iPad's native Video viewing program.  So it accomplishes the goal stated in my quesion.\nSince I started doing this I now use a Windows program called Disk Aid which emulates iTunes to the iPad and allows you to have total control over the iPad's file structure for copying files to and from the device.  I still use File Browser on the iPad to start the video files from the iPad.  I use Disk Aid to move files to the iPad instead of iTunes, and I start video files on the iPad using File Browser, which then allows me to run the videos in the native iPad video program.\n", "Q: Caps lock + letters A to l not working on mac USB keyboard I am on the verge on snapping my brand new 27\" iMacs keyboard. It's the latest USB model. I can't even login to my system because my password contains the letters I have said are not working. All was working fine yesterday. \nI can confirm caps lock and letters A to L are not responding. Every other key works as expected.\nHas anyone got any ideas before the keyboard becomes two and the iMac goes out the window?\n\nA: Seems like a hardware problem you should be able to replace it under the warranty if no liquid was spilled over it. \n\nA: Can we assume the you typed this question on a computer other than that iMac? \nIf the computer you're using to type this is a Macintosh with a USB port try plugging the keyboard into it and seeing if the same thing happens.\nIf the keyboard works fine on this second computer the problem is probably with your iMac and will take one kind of sorting out (boot it from an external hard disk to see if the problem is system related or a hardware problem).\nIf the keyboard doesn't work fine on this second computer take it and the receipt for your new iMac to an Apple store (or do it online or on the phone) and get a new one.\nAnd, if you can't sort this out or don't want to,  your new computer is under warranty, you can always let Apple sort it for you, possibly ending in a new computer.\n\nA: Turned out to be a hardware issue - the keyboard is f***ed, FYI: I typed this question on my iPad ;)\nThanks for the responses.\n", "Q: How does one export all contacts from iCloud? How does one export all contacts from iCloud in some sort of standard format? I would prefer to keep a backup in case my sync goes bad and I'm yet to find a way to export all my contacts. I would hate to lose hundreds of contact details if my sync from the iPhone goes bad.\n\nA: There is an Apple Page, iCloud: How to back up iCloud data that describes the various approaches that you can take, depending on what platform you are on.\nAs far as I can see, they all depend on having access to a computer!\nEdit\nFor Windows PCs, it says:\n\nOutlook 2007 or Outlook 2010:\nContacts: Export your contact data via Outlook's Export Wizard. For more information, see this article.\n\nThe linked article is on the Microsoft website, and describes standard Outlook functionality for exporting contacts.\nSo basically, yes, you can save all your iCloud contacts on PCs, and the mechanism is documented, so long as you have Outlook.\n\nA: The way that I did this was to use my contacts app, and simply use the  file export function to export the contact list. At any point you can always reimport the file that is produced with this. (I did this AFTER connecting my contacts app with icloud)\n\nA: I just had a massive heart attack after attempting to switch Apple ID accounts...\nI originally shared an itunes account with my brother so that we could share apps etc...\nBut after changing Apple ID's and reconnecting to the cloud, i lost all my contacts...\nLuckily they were stored in the Cloud with the old iTunes ID.

This is usually reserved just for testing or debugging a particular job.\n\n*launchctl stop <label>: Stops the job. Opposite of start, and it's possible that the job will immediately restart if the job is configured to stay running.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*launchctl remove <label>: Removes the job from launchd, but asynchronously. It will not wait for the job to actually stop before returning, so no error handling on this one.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*launchctl load <path>: Loads and starts the job as long as the job is not \"disabled.\"\n\n*launchctl unload <path>: Stops and unloads the job. The job will still restart on the next login/reboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*launchctl load -w <path>: Loads and starts the job while also marking the job as \"not disabled.\" The job will restart on the next login/reboot.\n\n*launchctl unload -w <path>: Stops and unloads and disables the job. The job will NOT restart on the next login/restart.\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I find the job label for a daemon, is it in the plist file?\n\nYes, it's in the plist file and it typically matches the filename of the plist file.\n\nA: Loading and unloading tells launchd to load the configuration file. Whether it runs the program and under what conditions is determined by the plist file. A job that isn't currently running can be started with launchctl start ... and stopped with launchctl stop ....\nThe label for the job is defined by the label key, and the name of the plist should also be the job label followed by the plist extension.\n", "Q: Accidentally turned on Siri using an iPhone 4 (not 4S) I was using the Facebook app when it decided to freeze. Out of frustration, I clicked the home button multiple times. I got back to the homescreen with VoiceOver turned on ('Triple-click Home' was not set) and a second later, Siri loaded. I tried to take a screenshot, but Siri closed just before the 'flash' took place.\nHas anyone else experienced this? Non-jail broken, iOS 5.0 on Verizon.\n\nUpdate:\nI have restored my phone a couple of times since this happened, mainly due to this issue: Audio output and volume controls gone after updating to iOS 5.1\nSo, unfortunately, any useful information contained in the crash logs has been lost.\n\nA: Was it Siri or was it Voice Control?  Voice Control has been on iPhone since iOS3.\nSiri on the left,Voice Control on the right.\n \nYou activate Voice Control by holding the Home button for a few seconds, even while the phone is locked.\n\nA: Attach your iPhone to a Mac, If you have access, and see if you can get at the crash logs or the device console. Like others, I'm curious to know more about this. If you can see the crash logs via Xcode or something, you might be able to see more about this. Otherwise, it's a bug which you can't reproduce. Oh well. \nBeing as siri is part of the OS, it's entirely possible that it loaded, then crashed because of missing files or whatever. \n", "Q: How do I load specific pictures from iPhone 3G to my PC?

Do realize, however, that Office for Mac isn't exactly the same as it is on Windows, and may not necessarily be worth the hefty price tag.\n\nA: Easy Books by Geode Software provides complete accounting, invoicing, and time-tracking functions on your Mac – which looks like it's a good fit for your lawn business.\n", "Q: Installing iOS on VMware Workstation I have a Windows PC and VMware Workstation. I am trying to figure out a way to install iOS on it.\nIs there is way to install iOS on VMware Workstation?\n\nA: No.  See relevant Stackoverflow discussion. \nIn short, you need to virtualize the ARM cpu, not an x86 model. Additionally, you'd need to virtualize the swipes and taps and whatnot, which would be quite the tall order.\nHere's one project that's attempting to virtualize iOS on the QEMU platform: IEMU.\n\nA: xpadian\nit is not for vmware,but it is work and it is the best ios 7 emulator.\n", "Q: Voicemails not being intercepted by Google Voice I have a Google Voice account that is set to transcribe voicemails and send them as e-mail.

Checking Directory Services for network file system mounts, i.e.\nsudo dscl . -list /Mounts\n\nand\nsudo dscl . -readall /Mounts\n\nreturns nothing, yet the /etc/fstab file is deprecated in Lion. Why is dscl returning nothing and where are the mounts defined if they aren’t by Directory Services?\n\nA: OS X uses the Autofs stack to mount network file systems. Keith Winston has a good introduction to Autofs on OS X stating that:\n\nOS X uses an autofs code stack based on Sun's Solaris version of Unix. Many of the advanced features are not documented very well, and this can be an issue unless you are familiar with Solaris. I was not and had to do quite a bit of digging.\nAutofs is often used in enterprise environments to set up network-based home directories and other network mounts for users at login. It can also dynamically mount network shares on access.\n\nBy default, Autofs mounts network files systems defined via Directory Services, those defined in /etc/fstab and NFS file systems, all accordingly to its master table, /etc/auto_master.\nYour call to dscl returns nothing because no mounts have been defined in Directory Services (no surprise there). If you want to define mount points not covered by Autofs default configuration without resorting to Directory Services or the deprecated /etc/fstab, you will have to add a mapping (via a auto_* file) to auto_master. For the technical background, refer to the post linked above; there is a good “how to” add auto mounts for SMB mounts in this Mac OS X Hints post.\n", "Q: How do I change Software Update server to official one on OS X Lion (or later)? I recently bought a new macbook pro with Lion, had some problems and had it checked by Apple people. It was returned to me but the software update server seems to have been changed and will not update. How can I change to the official one? I would like to avoid the 2 hour drive.\nThanks!! \n\nA: Before driving to the Apple technician, you can type the following Terminal command:\ndefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL\n\nThis will tell the the URL that SoftwareUpdate is checking.\n\nA: It depends on exactly how they changed the update server setting.  If they did the obvious thing, this should delete the setting (so it'll go back to normal):\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL\n\nIf that doesn't work, it's possible it's configured as a per-user (rather than system-wide) setting, in which case this should do it:\ndefaults delete com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL\n\n\nA: On system newer than 10.10\nsudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog\n\n\nA: The above is almost, but not quite correct. It should be\nsudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist\n\nFollowed by a reboot.\nthis will delete whatever server your Mac is looking at to get software updates and will let it default back to the Apple one. I've just done this on an iMac running El Cap which was trying to get updates from an in-house update server that was disconnected years ago.\n\nA: sudo defaults rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist\n\nthen reboot\n", "Q: Boot Camp Windows 7 Taskbar overlapping maximized windows I have Windows 7 SP1 Home Premium x64 installed under Boot Camp 4.0 in OS X Lion (10.7.2) on the 2011 Mac mini and it's also hooked into Parallels Desktop 7 as a VM when I need it in OS X.\nAn interesting problem I've noticed lately is that when I'm in Boot Camp any window that gets maximized will maximize past the Taskbar and therefore cover the contents of the bottom of the window. This behaviour applies not only to maximized windows but even windows that are set to open at the bottom of the screen but usually stick to the Taskbar as a boundary (i.e. run prompt). This has become irritating as I use Download Statusbar in Firefox as an example and I can't access the downloads if they're covered by the Taskbar without hiding it first.\nThe reason I brought up Parallels Desktop earlier is because the Taskbar acts normally in VM state. Windows will adhere to the Taskbar as a boundary and everything works as expected. Only when I'm in Boot Camp does it ignore the Taskbar as a boundary and maximize the window to the edge of the screen.\nI've tried a number of solutions Google has given me including unlocking/locking the Taskbar, moving the Taskbar around, modifying some Registry entries but nothing has worked. What did end up working as a last resort was reinstalling the Boot Camp partition but the problem came back later on.\nAnyone here have some insight as to what may be going on with the crazy Taskbar and possibly a way to fix it?\n\nA: Problem finally solved. I read your article, and like you, I have been searching the internet for a solution. Your article inspired me to try and uninstall Parallels Tools, as I thought it might have set up some strange settings. And after I uninstalled Parallels Tools, all was fine again. My windows are once again maximizing correctly. This is bad news however, as I also want to use Parallels Tools when I run in OSX. Guess I have to go back to VMware Fusion or hope a newer version of Parallels Tools will fix it.\n", "Q: Escape doesn't work OS: OSX Snow Leopard 10.6.7\nAfter a several months of work escape key stopped working.

I have MacBook Pro 13\" Mid 2010, NVIDIA GeForce GT 320M\nRecently (but right after installing OS X Lion) I've encountered artifacts on my screen. It's quite often and I can't say if the problem came from Lion (which brought me also problems with sleeping and few freezes, which I never had on Snow Leopard)\nSo is there any good way how to test my graphics card? or just it's video memory?\n\nA: MBP 13\" 2010 with NVidia GT320M uses shared video memory, so any ram test would be sufficient. My recommendation is to test using memtest86+. If there are problems - try removing one of the sims and run with half of your memory.\n", "Q: How to correctly download WWDC videos from iTunes U? I am trying to download WWDC videos from iTunes U.

Should I wait for new iTunes update?\n\nA: I had the same problem and setting iTunes to run in 32-bit mode fixed it for me. There might be an issue with the video encoding on some of the older WWDC videos like the \"Working with Core Data\" video that can be found at the Apple developer video site under iOS.\nTo set iTunes to run in 32-bit mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iTunes.\n\n*Open your applications folder and control-click or right-click on the iTunes icon.\n\n*Select \"Get Info\".\n\n*Click the checkbox next to \"Open in 32-bit mode\".\n\n*Open iTunes again and you should be able to download the videos to your collection.\n\n\nWhen you are done with your videos, you can always reverse these steps to set iTunes back to 64-bit mode.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem when downloading videos from iTunes U.\nWhile an update might be required to properly download videos, what I've done was to \"Watch\" the download progress window (I.E. I kept the downloads window from iTunes open while everything was downloading.) And for some reason, after the download, the file gets processed and is available for viewing.\n", "Q: Using iPhone as a iPod I was recently given a used iPhone 3G as a gift, and I intend on using it as a iPod.

Now I cleaned all the bookmarks on my Mac but iCloud keeps syncing the old data and the deleted bookmarks reappear. On the icloud.com website, I found no way to reset the bookmarks. The iCloud pref pane doesn't offer any help either. Did I miss something?\n\nA: The above method is nice; however, it won't help if you have 1000s of duplicates like I do. I wrote an Automator script that simulated the deletion of each book and then ran it.\n\n\nA: According to this detailed Apple Support Forum post the trick is to use Lion 10.7.2 and Safari 5.1.1 to force a flush of the Data.\nSimplified steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off bookmark sync on all devices except the Mac\n\n*Backup current bookmarks on Mac\n\n*Correct bookmarks on Safari on the Mac\n\n*Move the new bookmarks out of you Safari Library folder\n\n*Delete all bookmarks and wait for iCloud to update.\n\n*Move the new bookmarks folder back and wait for iCloud to update\n\n*Delete all bookmarks on iOS devices and re-enable sync.\n\n\nIt's laborious, but I am fairly certain Apple will release better tools for this process.

They introduced Photo Stream reset mid way in the Beta, so I am sure they will bring the rest through over time.\n\nA: Luckily I just finished doing this after reading this post. The key for dong this that I found was to turn off syncing on Lion, and then perform the tedious task of deleting all the bookmarks on the iPhone. For some reason, when you change things on the iPhone it seems like iCloud gets updated much faster. Then once I was sure that syncing was done (if you move to a different folder and then tap the \"Edit\" button, it'll tell you if it's syncing), I turned sync back on on the Lion computer, and lo and behold all the bookmarks synced nicely the way that I wanted. I hope that helps as well as the post above.\n\nA: If you have thousands of bookmarks like I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*switch off Safari syncing in iCloud on all your mobile devices, then\n\n*go to your Mac\n\n*open Safari\n\n*edit bookmarks, then\n\n*search for some common string in the bookmark entries, e.g., buzzfeed.com, or http:// or https://\n\n*press Cmd-A to select all the search result entries, then Shift-Delete to send them all to oblivion\n\n*then after a moment, re-enable Safari syncing on all your mobile devices.\n\n\nVoila!\nPS: Inspired by @BinaryMisfit's answer\n\nA: If you look for duplicate bookmarks cleaner, want to sort, clean up and organise your Safari here is a great app for it:\nhttps://appssalon.de/bookmarkapp\n", "Q: Can I continue to use a Mac while Carbon Copy Cloner is cloning its HDD? Carbon Copy Cloner is taking 2.5-3 hrs to work its mojo these days. I suspect this has something to do with the switch to Lion (the same process took 20 mins on SL.) \nIn any case, is it advisable to continue to use the Mac while CCC is backing up the drive? It's a one HDD iMac.\n\nA: The Carbon Copy Cloner FAQ states:\n\nYes and no, it really depends. Performance will be affected during the clone (especially the first one) as CCC reads the entire source volume and writes to the destination volume. If your work is \"disk bound\" -- that is your applications are reading or writing to either the source or destination, then you'll notice a performance hit. If you're just reading email or writing a Pages document, then you probably won't notice the performance hit.\nAffecting the accuracy of the backup task is something else that should be considered. Typically it's OK to work from the source volume while you're copying it, with the understanding that if CCC copied a file, then you open it, make changes, save it, then CCC completes the backup task, the modified version of your document is not backed up (this time around). Typically that's no big deal, the modifications will get backed up the next time the backup task runs. More importantly, though, if you're working with large files (mounted disk image, Entourage email database, VMWare/Parallels container) during the backup operation, it is possible that those large files could be modified while CCC is backing up that file. This won't affect the source file, but there's a good chance that the backup version of that file will be corrupt. For this reason it is a good idea to stop using applications that may be modifying large files.\n\nTL;DR: there is performance hit depending on the intensity of file I/O you produce; files you work on will not be backed up; large files may get corrupted.\n", "Q: Can Lion detect 1920x1200 screen resolution? I own a MacBook Pro, 17\", MA897D/A, A1229, Mid 2007, with a display resolution of 1920x1200 which worked seamlessly under 10.4.\nAs I upgraded to Lion I sadly noticed that the maximum resolution now is 1680x1050.\nDid anybody experience similar behaviour?\nIs Lion unable to detect the native resolution?\nAre there any 'power settings' I could use?\n\nA: The current 17\" MacBook Pro which ships with Lion also has a native resolution of 1920 x 1200:\nhttp://www.apple.com/macbookpro/specs-17inch.html\nMy guess is Making a new user or booting into safe mode will help you sort out whether something got munged in your user account in the Lion install.\n\nA: This is what I would try: \nOpen /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist with a PLIST editor.

If not, is my only other option to purchase bulky/expensive wireless headphones, or is there another way?\n\nA: The Bluetooth profile necessary for stereo audio, A2DP, is supported by OS X since version 10.5 (aka “Leopard”). As you use 10.4 (aka “Tiger”), the answer to the first part of your question is:\nBluetooth audio only works in 64 kbit/s mono quality via the headset profile in 10.4.\nProbably not what you want for music listening, even if the headphones support it. As to the second part of your question:\nYou are stuck with wireless solutions working via the audio jack, USB or FireWire.\nIn the case of USB / FW solutions (if such wireless solutions exist), check these for 10.4 compatibility before you invest.\n\nA: Yep, Bluetooth works. Take a look a this :) A bit expensive, but I'm sure there are a lot of alternatives around.\n", "Q: Hold mouse at the edge of the screen to jump to other monitor on Mac OS X Lion I just set up my new TV on the wall above my iMac, so I arranged the external monitor above the main one in the preferences. The problem is that it got very hard to access my menu bar on top of my main monitor, when I move my mouse up so fast it would jump to the other screen! So I have to be precise and move my mouse slowly every time I want to hit something on my menu bar.\nThe question is, is there a way that I would have to hold my mouse on the edge of the screen to jump to the other monitor instead of it jumping right away?\n\nA: Not by default in OS X there isn't a way to do that, and I don't know of any third-party utilities that do that either.\nYou could put the TV on an upper corner of the monitor (see below for ASCII art). Then you'd only be using a corner to transit the screens, not the whole top of the monitor.\n               +--------------+\n               |              |\n               |              |\n               |              |\n+--------------+--------------+\n|              |\n|              |\n|              |\n+--------------+\n\n", "Q: Restore videos backed up to iCloud? I have some videos on my iPad, which have gone corrupt somehow. They do not play and say Unknown in the details.\nI had taken a iCloud backup of these. How do I force them to be downloaded back to my iPad to replace the corrupt videos?\n\nA: iCloud does not actually backup the videos, only the metadata. The Videos themselves still need to be synced via iTunes or the App Store/iTunes download on the device. \nLike the old backups made in iTunes, the backup contains the metadata, settings and various other bits or pieces that is not part of a normal sync or purchase.\nWhen you restore a backup it will afterwards start syncing the actual media and apps from iTunes, if it is done via iTunes, or start downloading the media and apps from the App Store if you haven't used iTunes for syncing. This does not include videos or music that was not purchased from the iTunes store.\nThe only videos that are backed up are those in the Camera roll as per this Apple support document. Also note the disclaimer at the bottom:\n\nBackup of purchased music is not available in all countries. Backup of purchased TV shows is U.S. only. Previous purchases may not be restored if they are no longer in the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBookstore.\n\n\nA: Assuming your data falls in a category that gets backed up to the cloud, the simplest method is to tell iOS to erase all content and settings. This gets you a clean slate and best chance to address whatever corruption has happened. You might even test things a bit - then wipe a second time before loading your backup to be sure the device itself doesn't need service or to be restored.\nDo check very well that the specific videos you seek are getting backed up and perhaps take the device offline (AirPlane mode) temporarily to prevent a backup of the bad data if you can.\nIf the photo roll is corrupted (which is often the main cause of this), you will need to wipe the entire device as there isn't a lever to delete just that data and the associated files. (Yes, you could jailbreak it and perform surgery or perhaps find a tool to do this, but I don't have the knowledge / time to assist there)\nOnce the device is empty, sign in and restore your backup.\n\nHere's the problem. Unless you caught the corruption and disabled backup, it's entirely possible the corrupt data is sitting in the cloud. Without a second device, you can't easily test things, so be sure you are ready to erase things. I would take the device to a computer and get a second backup, just in case - but I have lots of other things I care more about than the camera roll.\nBest luck - here is the required reading on backups as well as iCloud:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud: Backup and restore overview \n\n*iOS: How to back up\nThe first is specific about how iCloud is different than USB/WiFi backup to a computer. The second is more general and includes restore step by step guidance.\n", "Q: Transfer Videos From iOS5 Device to Computer Wirelessly: Possible? It seems that the majority of my device's content can now sync wirelesslly to my computer either via wifi sync or iCloud photostream.  Notably, photostream does not encompass videos.\nIs there a way to transfer videos from your iOS5 camera roll to your computer wirelessly, or does this still require a hard line, cable transfer?*\n*I tried to get around this using Dropbox sync over wifi, but the 4S's HD videos were too large for the Dropbox app to handle.  \n\nA: I haven't tested it with videos, but I've had some decent results using PhotoSync. I think it's $2 or $3 on the app store, with a free Mac side client. Transfers photos and videos to/from your iOS library wirelessly without using iTunes. It also supports albums in iOS 5.\n\nA: The Eye-fi app does this, but it requires you have an Eye-fi account, which requires you purchase an eye-fi card.  They can be had relatively inexpensively now.\nAn advantage with eye-fi device, though, is that all your pictures and videos will end up on your computer, whether taken with your camera or iOS device(s), automatically.  It's a decent solution for getting everything from several camera sources into one spot.\nThe app is free, but you have to purchase the eye-fi device to get the account that will enable your iOS device to transfer its own photos and video automatically.

I recently started syncing my iPad and iPhone with iCloud. I selected to merge my contact list into iCloud from both devices. The problem is that, while I use my iPad for my email, I don't use it at all on my iPhone. Now, if I want to call a contact, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. \nI need a way to only view phone numbers, not email address-only contacts.\nI know that Android has the option to only view contacts with phone numbers (well, at least in CyanogenMod). I'd like to know if I can do the same thing on the iPhone? I am not using a Mac, and certainly don't have OS X Lion, so I'm only using iCloud on my iPad and iPhone.\n\nA: The native Contacts and Phone apps do not support this in iOS. As a workaround, you could use a third party contacts manager which supports smart groups, creating “Has a phone number” and “Has an email address” groups and working from these. Note that the contact lookup sheets shown by other apps (like, say, Mail) are provided by the native app and thus will not show your new groups.\nA free example of such an app for the iPhone would be Tacts – searching for “smart groups” on the App Store should get you more. \n\nA: The iPhone Contacts app will not let you do this. You have a few options though. One, just add the people you call a lot to your Favorites list in Contacts. The other is to rely more on searching for a contact (by scrolling to the very top of the screen) rather than swiping. I do this almost exclusively versus scrolling through the list, as I've found it much faster. \n\nA: Arrange your contacts in Gmail\nThere will be (My Contacts) with all numbers and emails\nChoose only contacts with emails and put them in a new group (say MyGmail Contacts)\nNow you will have only contacts with numbers in the main (My Contacts) folder\nSyc with iPhone \nNow you will have only contacts with numbers in iPhone\n\nA: You could use Gmail contacts for your contacts you need to email, and your iCloud for the people you need to phone. Then, switch off Gmail syncing on your iphone, and switch off iCloud on your iPad. If you ever need to email someone you can switch on GMail contacts on your iPhone, send the email, then switch it off again.\nIt's a little clumsy because you end up with duplicates, but that's not really a problem as such, as you can always consolidate them into one address book in future.\n\nA: I solved it so that the iPhone Contacts app only show contacts with phonenumbers. My solution requires that you use Gmail for your contacts with phonenumbers. This is easy if you are an Android convert as myself. On an Android phone, your GMail directory is your Android phonebook. \n\n\n*\n\n*First I enabled Contacts sync between the iPhone and Gmail using CardDAV.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open “Settings” then go to “Mail, Contacts, Calendars” (or \"Accounts & Passwords\" on later iOS) and choose “Add Account”\n\n*Select “Other” and look under “Contacts” to choose “Add CardDav Account”\n\n*Enter the following details into the fields, then tap “Next”. Server: google.com, User Name: googleemailaddress@gmail.com, Password: your password\n\n*Syncing starts immediately, exit out of Settings and launch the “Contacts” app to check on the progress, the entire process may take a while for large address books\n\n\n*After that you need to change your default account for new Contacts so that new contacts that you add on your iPhone are stored in your Gmail account.\n\n*Now open Open \"Contacts\". Click on \"groups\" in the upper left hand corner. Deselect all other accounts so that only your Gmail account is shown.\n\n*Done! \nNow when you look at your Contacts on your iPhone you will only have contacs with phonenumbers. A good sideeffect using this strategy is that it will be easy to switch back to an Android phone.\n\nA: ALL! I just figured it out! Under mail, contacts, calendars scroll to contacts and under default account switch to On My iPhone. Now the default contacts list is just people with phone numbers. At the top go to groups and all contacts if you want email contacts\n\nA: I use my iPhone 5 for work and it syncs with my Outlook on my Windows PC/laptop. When I went to settings and turned off the Contacts switch for the email account it deleted all my contacts. Not a good thing. Instead, I went into Contacts and selected Groups at the top of the screen. I then deseleted Suggested Contacts. Now only the contacts that I input show up and all the random email addresses that I sent an email to once are hidden. They are still there in Suggested Contacts if I want to see them.\n\nA: I have an iPhone 5s.  The way I eliminated email contacts in my contact list is as follows:  Go to Settings, Mail/Contacts/Calendars, scroll to Contacts and tap Default Account.  Mine had 2 checked--my iCloud and my email address.  I unchecked my email address and left iCloud checked.  That did the trick.  \n\nA: One can create a smart group in contacts with option \"phone\" \"is not set\" and delete all those contacts. That should get rid of all contacts without phone number.\n\nVice versa , you can create a group of contacts which has a phone number as well.\n\nA: All you have to do in Gmail is to create a label for the contacts that do not have phone numbers. Put all of your contacts with no phone number into that label. Then select all the contacts in the list with no numbers; on the right of the screen you will see 3 dots, click on the dots and you will get a drop down menu with the option to hide from contacts. Go back to your iPhone and go to the Gmail account that you have your contacts on and turn off contacts. You will be asked if you want to delete from phone; click OK, check to see if your contacts are gone from phone if so go back to mail account and click on the contacts. That's it; you will only have contacts with numbers. \n\nA: This annoyed me too. Solved in 2 seconds.\nGo to phone icon:\nContacts (next to Favorites, Recent, Keypad, Voicemail) like you want to make a call.\nYour contacts should all be in view.\nGo to Top Left GROUPS.\nUn-check everything except: All iCloud and Trade Directory (leave checked)\nClick DONE at Top Right.\nSolved! yayayayayayaya!\n\nA: Settings -> go to the app you don't want to sync contacts -> switch off Contacts\n\nA: Open \"Contacts\"... Click on \"groups\" (found on the uper left hand corner)... And choose \"all iphone\" or \"all icloud\".\nDone!\n\nA: Just did this my iPhone5S & it worked - Go to contacts - select groups - Under Exchange or your email account simply select contacts & turn off suggested contacts - All email only contacts unless saved that way as a contact should go off.\n", "Q: How can I make an AppleScript activate upon logging in?

I have an old iBook (2003, G4) with a burnt-out harddrive.  Being a poor academic, I don't want to bother with replacing the drive.  I'd like to use an external USB drive in place of the harddrive.  I managed to get a copy of MacOSX (it was Tiger at the time of the burnout) onto a USB before the harddrive completely gave out (it seemed to be a problem with overheating so I took it into the coldest part of the house and copied it there).  But all my experiments in the open firmware came to naught: it seems that my iBook is too old to be able to boot directly from a USB.\nUnder Linux, this is not a problem.  I can put the kernel and boot stuff onto a CD.  The iBook will happily boot from a CD.  Then I can tell the kernel to find its root device from the USB stick (via a UUID).  This works well, and is my current system.\nBut I miss Mac OSX ... a little.  More so now that I have an iPad and don't want to have to use Windows to sync stuff with it.  Plus, I hate the fact that I got so close and yet couldn't quite get it to work.\nSo ... is it possible to specify a different root device to a MacOSX kernel than the device it is booted from?\n\nA: If your USB drive is partitioned with Apple Partition Map and the volume with Mac OS X is HFS+ formatted it will probably boot iBook G4 by simply holding Alt/Optn at startup and choosing said disk.\nThis may not work on occasion of USB chipset in external box is not compatible.\nIt will probably not work if you just copied content of your hard drive and not restored it through Disk Utility (or cloned by other means). \nIf you cloned it properly and it still not booting try this Open Firmware trick.\nP.S.

But now I would definitely buy IDE 2.5 32GB SSD from ebay for the same money but better speed. Still I'm not sure if it worth it if you have one of the slowest of iBook G4 models.\n\nA: First, boot into Open Firmware shell.\nThen execute\ndev / ls\n\nand look for your USB drive. There should be something like\nff98ab00:    /usb@01\nff9a4f80:      /disk@1\n\nthen type\ndevalias\n\nand look up the alias name of your USB drive. Then you can issue the boot command\n<alias>/<device>:<partition>,\\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\BootX\n\nwhere  is the <devalias> you gathered in the second step (something like usb3), <device> the id of the actual drive which you can see from the first step in the line after your usb device (in this example they are /usb@01 and disk@1) and <partition> the partition number of OS X root partition, most likely 1.\nIf that starts to you boot, but then panics, try setting the root device explicitly and redo the procedure. Back in the OF shell:\nnvram rd=disk<num>s<partition>\n\nwhere <partition> is the same as above and <num> is a best guess of the devices path of your usb device.

However, I recently discovered an annoying side-effect: Image files in a a non-indexed folder do not show their image dimensions in the Finder!\n\nScreenshot shows that a image which was non-indexed does not have any dimensions.\nIs there any way of telling Spotlight to include a normally un-indexed folder in it's index to ensure that the dimensions are shown in the Finder?\n\nA: Well, in order to answer the implicit question stated in your headline: You can force Spotlight to index unindexed folders by creating a link to them in an indexed folder. Say you want to index something under ~/Library/, you'll be able to do that by creating a link under your home directory.\nUnfortunately, I can't answer your question proper: While this makes Spotlight comments etc. accessible, it still does not cause image dimensions to appear in Finder. But perhaps this is a starting point.\n", "Q: iOS 5 upgrade deleted calendar from iPhone and iPad I managed to go into iTunes and change some settings for the calendar and was able to recover some of my calendar for my iPhone but not all of my events are on there.  And my iPad calender has nothing on it!  My iPhone has an extra calendar which is the name of my email address and my iPad dosent give me an option for this calendar which is why I think it's blank.  So I need to know what my settings should be to find my original calendar that i had on my iPhone?\n\nA: Can you do a full restore from the backup at iTunes should have made before upgrading? Right click on iPhone in iTunes (device window on left) and hit restore from backup \n\nA: The same happened to me: I seemed to have lost all my info from my calendar after the upgrade. But it turned out to just not getting displayed any longer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings/Mail, Contacts, Calendar\n\n*In the Calendar section click \"Default Calendar\" and put a checkmark next to \"Home\" (or whichever calendar you want to see).\n\n*Switch to the Calendar app.\n\n\nI got all my data back! I hope it helps.\n", "Q: How can I add standard users to the print managers group? I'm sysadmin for a small company; my users are on 10.6.8 (iMacs) and do not have admin rights for various reasons.  The only times this is annoying is when a print job jams or otherwise does not go through, and the user can handle the issue, but I have to come by and type admin credentials to \"Resume\" the printer.  \nIs there an easy enough way to grant standard users rights to the Print Managers/Admin group?\n\nA: You can grant users partial admin rights (printers only) by making them members of the _lpadmin group.  This is a hidden system group, so it doesn't appear in the Accounts preference pane; you have to grant membership from the command line (as a real admin).  You can do this for an individual user:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -a fred _lpadmin\n\nor just add everyone:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -t group -a everyone _lpadmin\n\nBTW, membership in _lpadmin grants both the ability to manage queues, and also configure printer settings; if you just want to grant queue management (e.g. resuming queues), I believe you can do that by adding people to _lpoperator instead.\n\nA: For 10.5.8 there was solution involving Terminal.\nTry it and tell us if it will work.\n", "Q: What's the best way to control two Macs from one laptop? I have an MBP and a MacPro. I tend to use the laptop a lot of the time but have need to control the workstation (e.g. for iTunes, DVD Player, TV tuning etc.) from another room or when I'm working at the MBP in front of the Pro.\nCurrently I use Screen Sharing to do this, but it is perhaps not the optimal solution when dealing with multiple monitors (3 on the Pro). Ideally I'd like to be able to move the pointer off the screen of the MBP and have it appear on the monitors as if the laptop were connected directly to them. \nI think I saw an open source solution about six years ago but I can no longer locate it. Does anyone have any leads ...?\n\nA: It may not work ideally for every use case (you'd need to be near the monitors), but I can highly recommend QSynergy which will allow you to use one machine's keyboard and mouse to control the other. \n", "Q: Is it safe to use a device or disconnect it while syncing in iOS 5? Prior to iOS 5, iOS devices that were in the process of syncing with iTunes turned on their displays, locked the screen, presented a prominent warning that a sync was in progress, and offered an unlock slider to cancel the sync:\n \nIn iOS 5, all this is gone and there is simply a tiny sync indicator in the status bar (the screen remains off too):\n\nDoes this dramatic user interface change correspond to a major change in functionality? Is it safe to use an iOS 5 device while a sync is in progress; is it now safe to interrupt the sync?\n\nA: If you mean 'can I unplug my cable', then sure. It'll kill the process for that specific sync and you'll pick it back up next time. If you want to use your phone whilst syncing then you certainly can.\nIf you've gone wifi sync it'll just continue until either the network connection doesn't work, or the machine is stopped, or the sync finishes. \n", "Q: Can I backup my Time Machine drive to the cloud and restore it to any other drive? I currently backup my Mac to a local Time Machine drive.\nI'd like to start periodically backing up that drive to the cloud, using an as of yet unchosen solution.\nOnce it's backed up to the cloud, can I restore that Time Machine data to any other drive to restore my Mac?\nThanks\n\nA: Given the rather tricky use of hard-linked directories, access control settings and other special filesystem features I doubt that you will find a cloud storage which supports all this.\nOptions you may want to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the whole Time Machine drive into the cloud as an image (requires a lot of bandwidth at least for the initial copy)\n\n*use rsync to periodically copy your data to a remote (cloud) system\n\n\nPS: Rsync is a Unix tool included in macOS used to synchronize directories between disks or servers which supports incremental updates and a lot of other nice things. See man rsync for details.\n\nA: *\n\n*I think Dolly Drive will 'act as' as time machine drive in the cloud. I haven't seen any other services to offer that...\n\n*IDrive is able to back-up your time machine drive itself\n\n\nA: I wrote a guide on backing up OS X to a cloud server with Time Machine, so you don't need to rely on 3rd party software or scripting on your Mac.\nIt relies on OS X's inbuilt VPN features to secure the connection between your Mac and your server, and most of the work (20-30 mins) is in setting up the server side of things.\nI'm using it successfully on a poor 1Mbps upstream home connection.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add iCloud Reminders to iCal calendars? In iCloud, each Reminder is placed in a named list (called a \"List\" in the details dialog, and a \"Calendar\" in the context menu in iCal), but there seems to be no way to assign a reminder to an existing (\"normal\") iCal calendar (as there was with pre-iCloud \"To Do\" items).\n \nIs there a way to assign a Reminder to an existing iCal calendar?\n\nA: No. With iCloud and its supporting operating systems (iOS 5 and OS X 10.7.2), Apple has split the calendar stores on its online CalDAV servers to be either event-only, or task-only. Reminders sync to task-only calendars. See this Apple Support article for some details.\n", "Q: All apps that access the internet crash when opened I recently just bought a used Gen2 IPod.  It's worked fine until now.  When I left home, the wifi disconnected.  makes sense so far.  I clicked an online app while I was out so naturally, the app crashed (it was a texting app) right as it started to load the data from the web.  I have lots of these kinds of apps (different kinds of wiki things, etc.).  I've now come home to my sweat home and apparently (to my surprise) even after reconnecting the wifi (Safari works just fine), all of my apps that were connecting to the internet crash almost instantly.  \nWhy is this?  I'm officially stuck with Angry Birds (and I'm stuck so that isn't helpful).  Besides, Safari, none of my other web enabled apps work.  I can't text people.  I can't listen to my radio, etc.\nI've restarted it numerous times to no avail.\nAny help guys!?\n\nA: What version of iOS are you running? Have you tried clearing your web history, cache, cookies, etc? Go to Settings -> Safari and click all the options to clear this data.\n\nA: I found the solution (as odd as it was) from macrumers.\nI installed a free app (just a random app) and now everything works!  Odd.\n", "Q: Can anyone recommend good third party iOS email clients (especially regarding signature support)? Can anyone recommend an iOS email client (Exchange/ActiveSync or IMAP... preferably both) that supports really sweet email signatures?  Our company email signature has an official format that has a base64 encoded image and a standardized font/color.\nPlease, throw me some suggestions!\n\nA: Sparrow is now available for the iPhone, and it supports IMAP. \nThe app description does not mention exchange, and it specifically says that there's no POP support, but being that it's such a popular mail client, I figured it's worth mentioning. \nDisclaimer: I've never used it either on the Mac or on iOS\n\nA: Moxier\nThis is an email client which supports Exchange ActiveSync in the AppStore. But I'm not sure it supports sweet email signatures.\n\nA: Outlook Mail is pretty good and supports signatures.  The problem I've run into is that it doesn't support saved searches (As far as I can Tell) or unread search.\n\nA: Try \"Touchdown\" for iOS, available in the App Store. \n\nA: try Mail+ for Outlook by iKonic Apps...best email client out there\n", "Q: Internal keyboard QWERTY; External Keyboard Dvorak Is there a way to configure a MacBook Air running Lion (10.7.1) to recognize the internal keyboard as QWERTY, but to attach an external keyboard configured to use the Dvorak configuration?\n\nA: No, only a single keyboard layout can be active at one time and it will apply to all keyboards.  But switching layouts is very simple:  Apple/Command + space.  Or you can no doubt make it even simpler if you want.\nUpdate 2016:  It's possible now to do this with Karabiner, as described at\nDifferent key-maps/bindings for in-built keyboard and Bluetooth keyboard\n\nA: The common solution to this problem is to have the external keyboard emulate a standard layout (e.g. if you have an external Dvorak keyboard, it is seen as a Qwerty layout by the host OS). In the mechanical keyboard hobby community where keyboards are often programmable, this is the norm.\n", "Q: Updating a Jail-Broken iPhone I've jail-broken my iPhone 4 (iOS 4.3.3). I cannot restore it cause I don't have access to the computer that I used for jail-breaking my iPhone. Now I want to update my iPhone to iOS 5. Does it break the iPhone? or It'll work fine?\n\nA: You may run into some problems if you restore your iPhone from a backup, after upgrading. If you do a fresh install of iOS 5, you should not run into any problems.\n", "Q: Transfer video file from OS X Lion to iPod touch 4th gen with iOS 5 I have a recently purchased MacBook Pro with Lion and I want to transfer a video file to my iPod touch. The only problem is this is not the Mac with which my iPod touch library is synced, so I cannot really use iTunes sync feature. What can I do?\n\nA: Air Sharing will provide a network drive the Mac can drop files onto so you can view them on your touch.\n\nA: If you're looking for a workaround here, you might be able to use Dropbox. Store the file in your Dropbox account on your Mac, download the iOS client, and star the file as a favorite on your iPod touch. I believe that will cache it on the iPod touch. Then, when you click it, it should play.\nYou will need a wireless internet connection for the Touch on the first sync, but once it's starred as a favorite, it should be accessible even when offline.\n", "Q: Two phones on one account I have two phones that are both on one Apple account in Itunes. Now that I am on ICloud updating the two phones are merging information. How do I separate the two phones into distinct accounts?\n\nA: You can use different Apple ID's with different services. Create a new Apple ID for the second iPhone and use that ID for iCloud, while still using the same iTunes/App Store login.\nThere may be a way to manage how the devices sync (using the same account), but I have been using the above method successfully.\n"]
