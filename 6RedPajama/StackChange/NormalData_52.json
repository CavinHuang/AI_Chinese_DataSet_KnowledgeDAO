["Q: Though there is g++/gcc in Xcode 8, gdb isn't found When I installed command line tools of Xcode in old Mac OS X,\nthere were g++/gcc of a compiler and a linker.\nThere was also gdb of a debugger.\nIn Xcode 8.0 (8A218a) of Mac OSX EI Captain (10.11.6),\nthere are g++ and gcc, but gdb isn't found.\nI'd like to use a debugger of a command line tool.\nIs there a debug command? If there is, please tell me.\nWhen the g++/gcc [-c] .c/.cpp -g is executed before,\n*.o and executable format (a.out) seem to have included all symbol information.\nWhen g++/gcc [-c] .c/.cpp -g makes executable format (a.out)\nin case of Xcode 8.0 (8A218a) of Mac OS X EI Captain (10.11.6),\na directory called a.out.dSYM is made at the same directory,\nand symbol information seems to be here.\nWhen there are no debug command line tool,\nif it's possible to debug a program by a GUI of Xcode in IDE,\nplease tell me the way.\nRegards\n\nA: The command-line debugger in Xcode is now LLDB; the relevant command is lldb.\n", "Q: How to remove song from itunes I would like to prune the song list from the ones\nthat don't align with the current value set of mine.\nHow can I ditch the songs from the ios8 device from 10.11 desktop?\nNo remove button in sight. Dragging to trash does not work either.\nTrying to remove the item highlighted.\n\nA: The trick with iTunes is that you don't directly manage files on the device, you manage them on your desktop, and choose what is synced.\nNormally, iTunes syncs your entire library, only avoiding this when your device is full, or when you manually choose what to sync.\nYour question is a tad ambiguous, so I'm going to give two answers.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to remove a song from iTunes outright, deleting it from your computer and your synced devices, you must remove it from the \"upper\" Music selection, not the one listed under \"On your device\". The \"on your device\" list is read only.\n\n*If you want to keep songs on your computer but only sync certain ones, open the summary view on your iPod, select the \"Sync\" menu, and hit the \"Selected playlists...\" option. You can then create a playlist of the songs you wish to sync, and only sync that list.\nFurther detail from Apple\n", "Q: frequent screen blackouts followed by system crashes on MacBook Pro Retina OS X 10.10.5 I'm working away on my MBP when suddenly the screen blacks out and the operating system crashes instantly or shortly afterwards. The blackouts occur while using different programs, although I have a feeling that they are more frequent with graphic intensive software like Photoshop. After restart, the system is back to normal but it's not long until the next black out obliterates my unsaved work.\nBelow is one of the crash reports for the experts here that can actually make sense of them. I'm only gleaning from the gibberish that the crash probably occurred because of the GPU, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB in my case, suddenly becoming afraid of seeing my face and deciding to black out. Or does \"panic\" mean something else in this case ;-)\nWhat's going on here?

One is integrated with the motherboard ( the Intel HD Graphics 4000) and one is a separate desecrate card that is connected to the motherboard (the NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M.)\nThe Intel \"card\" is a low power graphics controller that is good for most display tasks, while the NVIDIA card is a more powerful card that gets used by more demanding applications (like Photoshop, VMware, etc)\nIt looks to me like you are suffering from a GPU panic on the NVIDIA card, perhaps when the computer switches from one card to the other - or due to the card overheating or hitting a bad memory segment.  I am not excellent at reading these crash reports.\nI recommend you take your machine back to the folks at Apple who can tell you what is required to swap out the offending graphics card.\n", "Q: keyboard keeps resetting itself to U.S I have a British keyboard which I have set in my keyboard preferences, however my mac keeps resetting itself back to U.S. \n\nThis annoying feature happens about 5 to 10 times a day.  How can I permanently set the language?\n\nA: The default key command to switch Input Sources is  Cmd ⌘   space  which you may be triggering accidentally.\nFrom comments, I understand the new default since El Capitan is  Ctrl ⌃   space , however it also appears it will remain at the old setting if you upgraded from an older OS.\nTo remove unwanted input sources go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources & remove all except the one you wish to keep.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to keep the other sources but not trigger them accidentally, then remove the shortcuts in System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Input Sources. [This option is only visible if you have more than one source in the previous pref pane.]\n\nWith the key command to change sources removed, you can change from the menu bar flag.  \nIf you remove all except one source, the flag icon will disappear.\n\nA: Please check in your keyboard preferences whether you have more than one language setting. If so remove the unwanted language.\nAlso check In system settings -> Language & Region whether are more than one language is setting. Remove all unless your main language.\nTest if works.\n", "Q: Run shell script on specified external HDD mount I keep some files on an external HDD and I've wanted to know what is currently on it without connecting it.\nI've modified this command to get a .txt file with tree-like structure of my folders on that HDD uploaded to my iCloud Drive when I connect it to my MBP.\nThis is my edited command which I have saved as .sh, now saving the file to desktop:\nls -R /Volumes/2TB/ sed -e '/^[^:]*$/d' -e 's/://' -e 's/[^-][^\\/]*\\//--/g' -e 's/^/ /' -e 's/-/|/' > /Volumes/SSD/Users/V/Desktop/File.txt\n\nSo far I've made a shortcut in BTT which runs the script but I would like it to run when I connect that HDD.\nSomeone suggested that I can could create a launchd with the StartOnMount key.\nThe problem is, as far as I understand from this thread, it's not possible to set up with specified volume.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: In this example the output of df is piped to grep which is looking to match the hard disk mount point- /Volumes/2TB. The exit status of grep determines the outcome of the condition and the ! reverses the logic.\nif ! df | grep -q '\\/Volumes\\/2TB$'\nthen \n    exit 0\nfi\n\nIn a sentence this says, if grep does not match /Volumes/2TB then exit the script.\nI would write the script like this to put it all together.\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n#\nif ! df | grep -q '\\/Volumes\\/2TB$'\nthen \n    exit 0\nfi\n\nls -R /Volumes/2TB/ |\n    sed -e '/^[^:]*$/d' \\\n        -e 's/://' \\\n        -e 's/[^-][^\\/]*\\//--/g' \\\n        -e 's/^/ /' \\\n        -e 's/-/|/' >/Volumes/SSD/Users/V/Desktop/File.txt \n\n", "Q: MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012) yellow tint when watching Netflix or YouTube in fullscreen I noticed recently that when I try to watch YouTube videos or Netflix in full screen on my Macbook Air, the whole screen will wash out with orange and yellow and I can't see anything. But it's perfectly fine if I don't watch it in fullscreen. And on Netflix, if I use subtitles, it's normal when someone is talking, but when the text disappears the screen gets an orange tint again.\nI've tried calibrating the colors through the display section of system preferences but it always tells me that there is an error. I've searched for someone who is having a similar problem but haven't found anyone.\n\nA: I noticed that this yellow tint problem just occurs on chrome but not on safari. I updated chrome and tested it out - still happening. I then restarted my MBA and it disappeared. Will observe that problem for the next days but I hope that helps anyone. Also, I hardly restart or shut down my MBA, it's been on or in standby for over 2 months.\nUpdate: still happening but found a new solution. I deactivated my extension 'Magic Actions for Youtube' and the problem disappeared. Again I will check if it still occurs.\n\nA: Found a solution!\nJust disable Night Shift in the Notification Center.\n\nStep 1: Open Notification Center By clicking the very right icon in the menu bar.\n\nStep 2: Scroll up.\nStep 3: Make sure Nightshift is set to Off\nThis is not ideal, but it seems to have fixed the problem for me. I will update this if the problem reappears.\n\nA: Same thing is happening with mine. If I keep my mouse on the play bar at the bottom and keep that up the whole time it doesn't happen, but as soon as I drift my mouse away from the play bar it happens again.\n\nA: There are two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a software bug, in which case you should upgrade to the latest software if you're not up to date.\n\n*If that doesn't seem to solve it, it could possibly be a hardware issue, although it would seem more likely for it to be a software issue.\n\n\nSolution:\nDo an update to the latest software on your computer if you're not up to date. Otherwise, check the status of your hardware and/or take it in to a computer repair shop and get it diagnosed.\n-T\n\nA: A chrome extension called \"Picture in Picture\" seemed to be affecting fullscreen on youtube and netflix by tinting or yellowing.  Deleted this extension and so far so good.\n\nA: I've found a workaround for color glitches on fullscreen videos on Mac\nDownload and install Helium Browser https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium/id1054607607 which is an always on top web browser (useful anyway for youtube videos).\nPut the helium browser window in a corner so that you can barely see it at all.\nSo when you put a video on fullscreen the color does not shift because the video has never full control over the monitor because Helium window also needs to be displayed!\n\nA: I have the same issue with macOS Catalina on the Macbook Air 2020 using Chromium based Brave Browser.\nAlso when disabling all extensions and restarting the browser this issue occurs. When on screen controls are visible (which is the case while moving the mouse for example), the picture is fine. As soon as the controls disappear the color shift appears.\nThis issue is linked to Chromium, since using Safari everything is fine! Also, this problem only appears if the chrome window is maximized on an external screen which is plugged in via HDMI. It does not appear on the build in screen of the Macbook nor if I connect the external monitor via a DisplayPort to USB-C cable.\nSolution\nDo one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Use a non Chromium-based browser for fullscreen videos on external screens (e.g. Firefox or Safari), until the bug is fixed on the Chromium side.\n\n*Connect your external displays not via HDMI (e.g. use a DisplayPort to USB-C cable).\n\n\nA: Try toggling hardware acceleration in your browser.\nIn Google Chrome, go to the Chrome menu > click Preferences > click Advanced in the sidebar to expand more > under System, toggle \"Use hardware acceleration when available\" > Restart Chrome.\nThis worked for me in Chrome.  Unfortunately, it didn't work for me in Firefox.  (Firefox also has a hidden setting that only appears when you uncheck \"Use recommended performance settings\".)\nYour mileage may vary depending on browser version, macOS version, and device since it's related to hardware drivers and the browser version supporting it.\n", "Q: What app or program do I use to open a chat.db-wal file What program or app do I use to open a chat.db-wal file?\n\nA: chat.db-wal (besides chat.db and chat.db-shm) is a part of the sqlite3 database managing all your messages sent and received by the app Messages.\nSo the main app using this database as a \"client\" is Messages.\nThe purpose of the file chat.db-wal is to provide atomicity and durability in database systems by write-ahead logging (WAL).\nYou can open the file explicitly by using any text editor (which I don't recommend) and implicitly by using a SQLite3 GUI like DB Browser for SQLite 3.9.0 or sqlitestudio 3.1.0.\n\nBetter create a copy of all database files and use these to tinker with them.\n", "Q: Split view with green button does not work in macOS Sierra When I try to use split view feature in macOS Sierra, I can not use the green button any more. Every help page found by google suggests I should click and hold the green button to activate split screen for the current window. The window would shrink and I could move it left or right and then choose an other open window to place it on the other side. This does not work with my MacBook on macOS Sierra.\nI can use split view via mission control for windows already opened in full screen, thats's fine. But sometimes I might prefer to activate it directly from the current window without putting it to full screen first.\nEdit: I have no 3rd party tools for windows management in use. I tried with Safari an Maps, both 1st party tools that do support the feature, as far as I know.\n\nA: Go to System Settings -> Mission Control activate the checkbox displays have separate spaces.\nLog out and In and check if it works.\n\nA: That is how it should work. It seems like something is interfering with the button press. Try disabling any window management apps such as BetterTouchTool.

But no, the following...\nThis Mac can't connect to iCould because a problem with \"aa@bb.com\"\n...window keeps popping up. How can I stop it? Even though I've already pressed \"Later\", after 1 or 2 seconds it comes out again! I am struggling for minutes to do things, and it is really annoying. \nI'm running macOS 10.11.5.\nThanks!\n\nA: Preferences > Internet Accounts: Remove your iCloud account.\n\nA: That dialog is particularly annoying and persistent.  Providing a valid password is one way of stopping the dialog from coming back, though I find that when this occurs it is best to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out\n\n*Log back in\n\n*Enter a valid password the first time this dialog pops up, OR enter the valid password in the iCloud page of System Preferences.\n\n\nIf I enter the password on the second, third, forth, etc. request, It seem that not all the things that wanted it get access to it.\nIf the problem is that you don't know the password, and have no way of recovering it, you might try deactivating or deleting the iCloud account from the iCloud page in System Preferences, then restart or at least log out and back in.  You can always add the account again later when you have the correct information.\n\nA: A temporary workaround to this annoyance is to kill the iCloud helper daemon.\nLaunch Activity Monitor app (in Applications -> Utilities), search for iCloud, select iCloud Helper, and click the Stop button.\nIt'll stop the dialog from appearing until the next reboot. Helpful if you’re servicing someone else’s Mac and you don’t know the iCloud credentials, which was my case.\n", "Q: How do I prevent prompts to update to iOS 10 I've got an iPhone 6 that I would like to keep running iOS9 for the purpose of testing iOS applications.  Is there any way to prevent the prompts to install iOS10?\n\nA: From this article:\n\niPhone checks whether an update is available through a special XML document at mesu.apple.com. This configuration profile redirects the check to only look for beta updates available for the Apple TV. Since your iPhone is not an Apple TV, the redirected catalog check will make your device “believe” iOS is up-to-date.\nThe configuration profile is cryptographically signed by Apple (in fact, configuration profile that redirects OTA update catalog through “Internal Settings” will fail to install if it is not), therefore, can be trusted. Other than adding a “Feedback” icon that you can dump into any folder at any time, this configuration profile does not negatively affect your iPhone’s performance or battery life. Don’t worry. It is not possible for your phone to suddenly install tvOS.\nAlternatively, you can also block “mesu.apple.com” through your router settings. However, as you connect your devices to Wi-Fi hotspots that you do not have control of, this would be rendered ineffective.\n\nThe profile is available here.\nYou should carefully consider the security implications of downloading and installing a profile from the Internet, but you should also be able to open that profile and inspect its contents before proceeding.\n\nA: Short answer, No.\nApple really, really, really wants you to upgrade.\nLonger answer...\nYou'd need to be able to block the domains  \nappldnld.apple.com\nmesu.apple.com\n\non every WiFi access point you meet.\n\nA: if you are using a proxy.pac file for your internet connection you can easily block  appldnld.apple.com and mesu.apple.com. You could use something like this:\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host) {\n\nif (host ==\"mesu.apple.com\") return \"PROXY 127.0.0.1:8080\";\nif (host ==\"appldnld.apple.com\") return \"PROXY 127.0.0.1:8080\";\nelse return \"DIRECT\"; }\n\nThat also mean you need a publicly available web server to host the .pac file\n\nA: An easy way is to use existing ad blocking apps to block your iPhone from checking Apple's server - specially mesu.apple.com and applednld.apple.com. These apps filters traffic coming in to you iPhone via a dummy VPN or a proxy auto-config file.\nI personally used Weblock on my iPad. There are other apps such as, Adblock or Adguard Pro, that should do the trick. Note that Safari content blockers won't work. \nThe overall idea is similar to the other answers here, but since it is not applied on your router, only your iPhone is affected.\n\nA: Depending on which version of iOS 9 you have, you could jailbreak the phone - that will prevent the update notifications from coming up again.\n\nA: Cobblers.\nTo stop the nagging requests to install the update, do the following.\nGo into the Settings app.\nGo to General > Storage & iCloud Usage.\nGo to Manage Storage (under \"Storage\" not \"iCloud\")\nSelect the downloaded iOS update (i.e. iOS 10) in the list.\nSelect Delete Update.\n\nA: Yes, there is a way to completely disable these automatic downloads (which, as you know,  consume valuable local storage space and bandwidth, repeatedly and without permission).

If you're using a dumb hub then all traffic would be sent to all ports. In fact, pretty sure WiFi is like a dumb hub- it sends all traffic and all clients are listening.\n", "Q: is there a way to disable update notifications in iWork apps (Pages, Keynote, Numbers)? Even with App Store Automatic Updates set to OFF, all of the iWork apps pop up a modal dialog box on startup to inform you there is an update.

On my MacBook Pro (Early 2015), I've been struggling with a problem since I upgraded to Sierra.\nI don't use Exposé very often, but some times, when I trigger it accidentally with a swipe on the trackpad, it freezes the window manager.\nWhat happens is that the windows start moving inwards (like they do for Exposé) for a beat, but then stops again almost immediately. And after that, the window manager appears to be frozen. I can't bring up any menus, get the “Force Quit” window to appear or change active windows. I can bring up the Cmd-Tab switcher and select a different window, but doing so does nothing – the app that had focus keeps focus, and the windows stay as they were. I can open Siri or Alfred via keyboard shortcuts, but neither receives keyboard focus or reacts to the mouse. I can talk to Siri, but since she can't log me out or kill a process or something like that, that's also useless.\nI've only found two ways out of this problem. One is to do a hard reboot (which I'm not fond of), and the other is to SSH in from another machine and do a “sudo killall Dock”, which does alleviate the issue, but requires some logistics.\nAny suggestions on how I can stop these freezes, or at least get easier out of them?\n\nA: It's still happening with maOS Mojave 10.14.1.\nWhen it happens to me, the OS isn't frozen, only Expose is.

Is there a way to disable automatically connecting to a known WiFi network on an iPhone?\nSay that your work/school has a monitored WiFi network.

But you also don't want to re-enter your credentials every time you want to connect.\nIs there a way to tell your iPhone to forget an network until you want to re-connect?\n\nA: At this time, there is no way to do this.  Your only options are to have it always on or always off.  \nI suggest letting Apple know you want this feature by providing them feedback here.\n\nA: It probably wasn't available in 2016, but it can be done in the WiFi settings now (at least since 2018):\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > WiFi\n\n*Click on the ⓘ icon of your WiFi connection you want to manage\n\n*Disable Auto-join\n\nA: Currently, you would have to tell the iphone to forget the network and then enter your credentials again later.

Apple has decided to move away from that method of opening the iDevice.  I don't see them changing their mind and putting it back so it's probably best to learn how to use it going forward.\n\nA: According to this site, you apparently could in iOS 10 beta 1 by making a backup, editing a file and then using iTunes to restore the backup to your phone. This functionality may, however, was removed in a future iOS update. \nThis implies that either you need to jailbreak your device to do something like that; otherwise there's no way to do so on stock iOS. \n\nA: Downgrade to iOS 9.3.5 if you want.\n", "Q: Trusting my computer with my iPhone no longer unlocks it for access (iPhone 5 w/iOS10, and Mac OSX 10.7.5) Ever since I upgraded to iOS10 my computer doesn't recognize when my iPhone \"trusts\" my computer.

I am migrating from a Mac Mini (early 2009) running OS 10.6.8 to a Mac Mini (2012) running OS 10.8.5.  I made several attempts to use Migration Assistant to copy everything; all ended hung at \"4 (or 3) minutes remaining\" for hours and hours.  According to Google lots of people have this problem, but if anybody solved it I haven't found it.  2+ hours on the phone with a senior Apple support technician didn't solve it either.\nNoting that it's always copying applications when this happens, I reran Migration Assistant copying everything except applications, and that completed.  (I have question marks in my doc where those applications should be.)  I tried Migration Assistant once more on just the applications, in case that made a difference, but it still hangs.\nClearly Migration Assistant doesn't like something in my set of applications, but I've found no diagnostics that would tell me what.  If it were choking on one (known) application, for example, I might try temporarily removing that to see if it helps.  I've got enough applications that I don't want to just start guessing.\nHow should I go about migrating my applications?  I think I need both the actual applications (contents of the Applications directory?) and settings (preferences, browser add-ons, etc).  Where do I find all the stuff I need to copy, and do I need to do anything more than copy the right files to the right places?  On Windows I know there'd be registry entries and config files and DLLs and stuff scattered across the disk, but Macs are different.  This is my first Mac migration.\nI'm trying to avoid reinstalling (and then reconfiguring) all of my applications because (a) hassle! and (b) some came on CDs/DVDs and the new machine doesn't have a DVD reader.\nI plan to update the OS on the new machine when I'm done, but I thought that migration might be easier if the OSs were closer to each other.\n\nA: It really depends on the application. With the advent of the Mac App Store a lot of applications have become more self-contained (everything lives within the app bundle). But, you're talking about an older systems so again, it just depends on the application.\nThe easiest thing to try is just copying them over from the old /Applications folder. If that doesn't work then your best bet is to re-run the installer (assuming it's still compatible with 10.8). If your old Mac has a disc drive you might be able to use the Remote Disc feature to complete your installation.\nI know some app developers have started to make digital copies available for people who find themselves without a DVD drive anymore- but you might have to reach out to them for help.\n", "Q: Use 15\" install DVD with 12\" PowerBook I recently bought a 12\" PowerBook G4 on eBay.

Could I use these disks with the 12\" PowerBook?\n\nA: Generally as long as you use an OS X build later than the one that came with the machine you should be good to go. In your case, it looks like all the 12 inch G4s can run 10.3, so most likely any retail 10.4 version should be fine.\nFor maximum safety, I'd go for 10.4.3 or later, as it seems that the last packaged version for a 12 inch G4 was 10.4.2 (build 8E90A), according to MacTracker.\n", "Q: Mid 2014 MBP w/ Nvidia to three 60in HD TVs?

In my case I only get the image of a blinking folder with a question mark.\nI tried with Cmd+alt+R, with the same result. \nWhy is my Mac behaving differently? How can I reinstall OS-X, even the original version?\nCould it be a BIOS issue?\n\nA: It's quite possible that there's no recovery partition on the drive, since it is a completely empty drive. I would highly recommend using Disk Maker X to create a bootable USB disk. Here's what you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Another Mac with access to the App Store.\n\n*A USB drive/stick with a capacity of at least 8 GB. Also be sure it has absolutely no data on it, since it will be formatted.\n\n*An internet connection in order to download Disk Maker X onto the other Mac.\n\n\nFirst, download macOS Sierra on the other Mac by searching for it on the App Store, but don't install it!\nNext, download and install Disk Maker X on the other Mac.\nThen, open Disk Maker X and follow the steps listed.\nAfter that, make sure the Mac you're trying to fix is off. Plug in the USB Stick, then press Option and press the power key. Select the USB disk in the window that loads, follow the setup process, and you should be good to go! Let me know if you have any questions.\n", "Q: MacOS and Kindle file Location Changed? MacOS Kindle version 1.12.0 no longer seems to keep downloaded books in the My Kindle Library location, no new files are showing up there. Does anyone know where they are being stored now? Without these files to find and remove the DRM for use on other non-kindle readers I'll probably just go back to finding my books on DRM free sites 8(\n\nA: Using Kindle v1.17.0, Kindle content is stored in the location set under Kindle menu > Preferences > General tab > Content Folder. (The default appears to be ~/Documents/My Kindle Content.)\nIf you are using Kindle for Mac from the Mac App Store, it has not been updated in nearly a year, and you should switch to the version downloaded directly from Amazon.\nYou can download or update Kindle for Mac by getting it directly from this Amazon site: https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/mac/download. (Note that clicking that link will initiate the download.) \n", "Q: Is the time required for incremental Time Machine backups greatly affected by the number of files? Is the time required for incremental Time Machine backups greatly affected by the number of files being backed up? I have a large number of files on my Mac that very rarely change and aren't \"mission critical\". If they greatly affect backup time I'll exclude them from Time Machine but if they don't I'll just backup everything. Backup size is a non-issue for me.\nIf it matters, I have Time Machine backing up to a remote box that is usually on the local network.\n\nA: Incremental backups only backup what has changed. The number of unchanged files is irrelevant during an incremental backup. If you suddenly change all of the \"large number of files\", the next incremental backup will take significantly more time.\n\nA: There are four types of backup, each has different time constraints that you can time down to the fraction of a second to convince yourself of the speed of each.\n\n*\n\n*First backup (count of changed files is the same as all files by definition)\n\n*Fast scan using file system events (count of files changes has little effect other than the time to back each up)\n\n*Deep scan using filesystem traversal on both the source and destination (count of files changed has no effect, all files are counted and compared)\n\n*Problem backup where you have to do a consistency check on the destination or purge files before the backup starts ( skip these as they are edge cases)\n\nTo time things and simulate a deep scan:\ntime tmutil compare \n\nTo time a full backup\ntime tmutil startbackup —-block\n\nI find backups to sparsebundles the worst to mange since they are finicky and you’re adding several layers of error with network and embedded filesystem with sparse storage overhead. Direct attached backups are superior for me and I use arq or rsync if I must have network backups. You can rsync or arq from a local time machine destination which gets the best of both worlds.\nIf you prefer a graphical tool to opening the command line, go immediately to this web site to get the time machine mechanic. It collects timing data from the system logs and does all sorts of excellent checking on backup health and statistics in general, far past simple timing measurements.\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/consolation-t2m2-and-log-utilities/\n", "Q: Any difference between ~ and $HOME? It would appear that ~ and $HOME are equivalent in command line and shell scripts. Is that true?\n\nA: It's true to a certain extent.\n\n\n*\n\n*$HOME is an expression for expansion of the environment variable HOME\n\n*~ (tilde) is a separate shell expansion component\nsee footnote\nWhen used as a command argument and in separation from other strings, $HOME and ~ are usually equivalent.\nBut there are cases where they differ:\n\n\n*\n\n*if the string containing either is quoted, for example:\n# echo \"My home directory is $HOME\"\nMy home directory is /Users/techraf\n# echo \"My home directory is ~\"\nMy home directory is ~\n\n\n*if they are concatenated to a string, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*dd if=${HOME}/source_file of=${HOME}/destination_file will work.\nShell will pass arguments if=/Users/techraf/source_file and of=/Users/techraf/destination_file containing a valid path to the dd command.\n\n*dd if=~/source_file of=~/destination_file won't work\nShell will pass arguments if=~/source_file and of=~/destination_file to the dd command and it will report an error as it does not interpret ~.\n\nfootnote:\nIn fact ~ is by default replaced with the value of HOME, but if HOME is empty, it is resolved to a home directory:\n# echo $HOME\n/Users/techraf\n# export HOME=/dummy\n# echo $HOME\n/dummy\n# echo ~\n/dummy\n\n\n# unset HOME\n# echo $HOME\n\n# echo ~\n/Users/techraf\n\nFrom man bash:\n\nTilde Expansion\nIf a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all  characters,  if  there  is  no unquoted  slash)  are  considered a tilde-prefix.  If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible login name.  If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter HOME.\nIf  HOME  is  unset,  the  home  directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead.  Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.\n\n\nA: $HOME is available on login early stages when ~ is not available. The reason is that $HOME is defined by system environment, and ~ is a shell shortcut. That's why $HOME is preferred for shell scripting.\n", "Q: Can't download any apps on iPad 1 I have an iPad 1 with iOS 5.1.1 that won't download any apps or update its OS. It was donated to my school so it was totally wiped before we got it.\nI've tried the work around previously mentioned of downloading the apps in iTunes then dragging them over to my device that is also connected to iTunes. When I do this, a dialogue box comes up saying it was unable to install the app because the app requires a newer version of iOS. I'm really hoping Apple didn't make it so a perfectly good piece of tech is obsolete by not making iOS upgrades or apps compatible with their older technology.\n\nA: The iPad 1 is literally almost 7 years old, which is an eternity in computers, but even more so in mobile devices. You won't be able to upgrade your device past iOS 5.1.1. Even if it can be argued that maybe it could've gotten one or two more updates, that Apple stopped updating it prematurely, at some point the hardware is literally incapable of running the software. The iPad 1 has long since passed that point. (It received OS updates for two years after release.)\nMost apps (at least commonly-used and updated ones) have long since abandoned iOS 5.x as a supported platform. Even Facebook, which has a vested interest in ensuring that the reach of its app is as wide as possible, requires iOS v8 or above. Instagram requires iOS v8 or above. Google Maps requires iOS v7 or above. The list goes on. The hardware simply isn't capable of running modern apps.\nApple has a track record of supporting hardware far longer than its competitors. Most iOS devices receive four years of updates, compared to competitors who ship devices with versions of Android that are outdated at the time the phone is released, and then maybe get one update if it's a particularly well-selling model.\n\nA: First you need a latest iPhone or iPad etc.now you have an apple Id which log in your iPhone and then this apple Id log in your iPad old version . On the app store of iPad and go purchase option and than you download the purchases app \n", "Q: iPhone 7 Plus Won't Turn On? So I recently got a new iPhone 7 Plus a week ago. Tonight, I got onto this website which kept on putting up pop-ups on the page. I went to the lock screen, and it instantly froze. I couldn't even unlock the phone. Then, it went into a black screen with the loading icon. I tried to shut it off several times, but no use. I tried to connect it to iTunes via my MacBook Pro, but since the phone has a password, iTunes sent a verification text to my phone. Of course, I can't access anything in my phone now. There's literally nothing I can do with the phone. (The battery was at 70%, if that helps.)\nSorry for the long post, but what do I do? I'm very worried that it might've gotten hacked or something. Please help!\n\nA: If a device seems like it's not responding to any input, often a hard reset, which is Sleep + Volume Down (for iPhone 7 and above; for iPhone 6s and below, use Sleep + Home) held until the Apple logo appears, is needed.\nPowering off an iOS device isn't like powering off a computer. It doesn't reset everything, flush RAM, etc as a computer does when powered down. It's more akin to hibernation mode on a computer, as it's designed to come back on quickly. The hard reset is more like turning the computer off and back on - it dumps RAM and does any housekeeping that might be preventing the device from responding. It does NOT reset any data, preferences, apps, content, or so on.\n\nA: Follow the same steps as if your phone is frozen and you can’t turn it off. \n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 7 is frozen and I can't turn it off\nForce reset and then wait or restore. \n", "Q: SSH address from terminal I live on campus and use a university secured 802.1x wifi network. The first question I have is, what's the difference between the IP address I can see from ifconfig and the address that is show as username@wireless1x-blah-blah-blah@university.edu? Since they both change does DHCP assign me both of them? Also is there a way to find this second, ssh usable address from the terminal? I can't seem to find a way to figure out how to make this ssh address static, so at least I'd like create a cronjob that copies and pastes it to a txt file on my cloud drive. \nImage of the address I'm talking about just for clarification:\n\nIf anyone knows how to make this static without router access on a 802.1x network that'd be super helpful also. \n\nA: It's the PTR record (reverse DNS) corresponding to the IP address which your computer was assigned via DHCP. It changes each time your computer gets a new address from DHCP and you can't make it static.\nThe problem here is not in the settings on your computer, but on all the other computers connected to the campus network (i.e. computers try to connect to your computer). These machines ask the DNS server (which they also know from the campus DHCP) for the IP address of wireless1x-blah-blah-blah@university.edu and the DNS server returns the corresponding IP address.\nYou'd need to make a DHCP reservation to get the same IP address always, but this only administrators can do.\n\nYou can check it with command-line:\ndig +short -x <your_ip_address>\n\nor if you know your interface name (en0 in the below example) automatically:\ndig +short -x `ipconfig getifaddr en0`\n\n", "Q: Error installing Nvidia driver for Mac Pro I am fairly competent with computers, but I've run into a problem that has me completely stumped. I have an Nvidia Quadro K1200 graphics card in my Mac Pro tower. I have used the Nvidia drivers with no problems, up until a few weeks ago, when Apple released the security update for OS X 10.11. When I tried installing the new driver, it gave me an error. I have now gotten this error in both OS X 10.11 and macOS 10.12, with both driver versions 346.03.15f03 and 367.15.10.05f01. The error appears after running through the whole install dialogue:\n\nNow, I looked at the logs in the Console and it appears to be some kind of SandboxViolation or System Policy error. Here is the list of errors that occurred during the installation:\n\nI can add the full text of the errors if that would be helpful, but I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas of what the problem is and how to fix it.\n\nA: I will answer my own question. Thanks to the help of the fabulous commenters, I managed to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) and install the driver. However, because I couldn't see the screen I had a bit of trouble. I booted the Mac Pro into target disk mode, then took an Apple laptop and used a FireWire -> thunderbolt cable to connect the two. I booted the laptop holding down the alt key. I selected the Mac Pro's recovery partition and booted into that. I disabled SIP in there. However because SIP is hardware specific, I had to change the laptop's startup disk to the one from the Mac Pro. I let it reboot, then installed the driver and shut off both computers. I booted both the laptop and Mac Pro up. The Mac Pro had installed the driver and still had SIP enabled. The laptop rebooted from its internal SSD. I hope this helps someone else!\n", "Q: How to re-activate my Command Shift 4 (for screen captures) I need to re-activate my Command+Shift+4 (for screen captures).

I'm currently on 10.10.5 and I want to partition my internal SSD into two, installing a fresh copy of 10.12 on the second partition (while keeping 10.10.5 on the original partition). I want to eventually delete the original partition on the SSD that the mac shipped with (10.10.5), leaving only the second partition of 10.12. \nDoing a search, it seems it may not be possible to make a second partition the only partition.\nWill Disk Utility allow me to delete the original partition? and will it allocate the full amount of regained space to the new partition?\n\nA: I've solved this problem by taking a completely different approach. I used Disk Utility to clone my internal SSD onto a new partition on an external SSD. I am now going to restore my internal SSD back to factory (by restarting, then CMD + R), then update it to 10.12. This way there is only a single partition with a fresh install of 10.12 on the internal SSD. I will still have my old bootable install of 10.10.5 and files on the external SSD, in case I need to access files or restore it back completely.\n\nA: Resizing the boot partition is a bit tricky - because you can't do it whilst booted from it.\nIf you want to avoid getting your hands dirty in Terminal, the old way to do it used to be iPartition, but it's getting a bit old these days & can't deal with Core Storage drives. The new kid on the block seems to be Paragon Hard Disk Manager, which I have but haven't yet used for this particular task. It's also capable of moving Boot Camp partitions around, should you ever have need of that.\nFor either, you need to be booted from another device. iPartition would make boot CDs, iirc, but Paragon can make boot USB keys; which I have used successfully.\nOnce you have two potential boot partitions, deleting either is just a reverse of your initial task, & being an SSD, the actual location of the data is unimportant, unlike on a spinning disk.\nMaybe wait a day or two to see if anyone comes up with the alternative Terminal method - which of course is free - or give Paragon a test drive; I think their demo is fully-functional [though I haven't tested the demo, I went straight for the full version]\n\nA: Indeed you can and in some cases that is how it has to been done. I believe adding El Capitan to a partitioned drive required such..\nOnce OS is installed.\nOpen Disc Utility > Select the HD in the left panel > Click on the partition to delete on the graph > Click the minus - button at the bottom.\n", "Q: How do Time Machine's checksums work? The man page for tmutil mentions that Time Machine records checksums of files, and lists a verifychecksums command. The man page is sparse on details, and does not otherwise mention checksums. I was wondering whether Time Machine ever automatically verifies these checksums (or if these are only verified when you run verifychecksums manually)? The page also says checksums are not retroactively computed, so how can I list the files in my latest backup for which no checksum is available? Also, is it known what checksumming algorithm is used?\n verifychecksums path ...\n         Compute a checksum of data contained within a backup and verify\n         the result(s) against checksum information computed at the time\n         of backup.\n\n         No output is generated for matching checksums.

The file's recorded checksum is invalid.\n\n         Beginning in OS X 10.11, Time Machine records checksums of files\n         copied into snapshots. Checksums are not retroactively computed\n         for files that were copied by earlier releases of OS X.\n\nThe above is from the tmutil man page in OS X 10.11.6, maybe the one in macOS Sierra has more details.\n\nA: I have a partial answer to my own question: while I don’t know whether Time Machine ever automatically verifies the checksums, a post on ycombinator.com provided me with an answer to my other two questions. The checksumming algorithm is the same one as the default one used by the Terminal utility cksum. The checksum values are stored in the Time Machine backup as an extended attribute of each file (com.apple.finder.copy.source.checksum#N). So to list the files for which no checksum is available, you would search for all files in the latest backup without the attribute, using a Terminal command like this one:\nfind '/Volumes/Time Machine HD/Backups.backupdb/Mac/Latest' -type f -not -exec xattr -x -p 'com.apple.finder.copy.source.checksum#N' '{}' ';' -print 2>/dev/null | grep /\n\nI’ll quote the original post for details on checking the stored checksum against the output of cksum:\n\nRJIb8RBYxzAMX9u on Apr 18, 2017\n  [...] In any case, the \"hash\" appears to be CRC32, stored in extended attributes:\n$ xattr .inputrc\ncom.apple.finder.copy.source.checksum#N\ncom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot\ncom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot\n$ xattr -px 'com.apple.finder.copy.source.checksum#N' .inputrc\n26 E5 4A AB\n$ cksum .inputrc\n2873812262 65 .inputrc\n$ printf '%x\\n' \"$(cksum .inputrc | cut -d ' ' -f 1)\"\nab4ae526\n\n\n", "Q: Need to partition free space after clone on mbp I cloned my MacBook Pro 1 TB SSD to a 2 TB SSD.

After entering your password the system will boot to your desktop. Now you should be asked for the password of SSHD2TB to unlock it. Enter this password.\n\n*Open Disk Utility and verify/repair SSHD2TB.\n\n*Open Terminal.app and enter diskutil list.\n\n*With the disk identifier of the 2 TB SSD (in your example disk2) enter:\ndiskutil info disk2 | grep \"Total Size\"\n\nthis will yield something like:\nTotal Size:      2.0 TB (2000390717440 Bytes) (exactly 3907013120 512-Byte-Units)\n\n\n*Then enter diskutil cs list.\n\n*You will get a similar or identical output as in your question.\n\n*To resize the whole stack use the command diskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID size with lvUUID= the Logical Volume UUID of SSHD2TB and size: the final size in t (TeraByte), g (GigaByte), m (MegaByte) etc.\nNow you have to subtract the size of the EFI and the Recovery HD from the found total size to get size: ~2000391 MB - 210 MB - 650 MB = 1999531 MB.\nIn this case the command is then:\ndiskutil cs resizeStack DA8E726B-6383-4470-BE08-97745C29D5DA 1999531m\n\nIf you get an error:\nError: -69720: There is not enough free space in the Core Storage Logical Volume Group for this operation\n\nsimply choose a slightly smaller size like 1999525m instead and reenter the command with this value.\nIn some rare cases a magic size of 0g also works: \ndiskutil cs resizeStack DA8E726B-6383-4470-BE08-97745C29D5DA 0g\n\nThis will expand the stack to the max size possible. \nBoth commands resize the whole CoreStorage stack and move the Recovery HD on the 2 TB disk (in your example disk2s3) to the end of the disk.\n", "Q: How to store iCloud Photo Library only in the cloud My iCloud Photo Library is 16GB. Because the drive in my Mac is only 128GB I don't want all my photos to be stored locally on my Mac but rather just load the photos when I open the Photos app.\nAny idea how to do this?\n\nA: You have two general options for your situation.\nThe less drastic (and easier) option is to enable Optimize Mac Storage, under Photos > Preferences > iCloud tab. This will cause your computer to remove original-size photos and only store thumbnails when you are running low on space. The originals will continue to be stored in iCloud.\nThe other option is to not make any changes to your iCloud Photo Library settings and move your Photos library to an external hard drive. This would require a bit of effort, and the hard drive will need to be plugged in when you want to use Photos.\nTo move the photos library to an external hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Photos.\n\n*In Finder, click on the Pictures folder in the sidebar. Inside this folder should be an item named Photos Library.photoslibrary. Hold the Command key and drag this to your external hard drive. It may take some time for it to move.\n\n*Launch Photos while holding the Option key. This will cause a popup to appear that asks you to locate your library.\n\n\n\n*If the library from the external hard drive doesn't appear on the list, click on Other Library and navigate to your external drive, then open the Photos Library.photoslibrary library that you copied earlier.\n\n*At this stage you will probably get a prompt starting with \"This library contains items that need to download from iCloud Photo Library.\" Click on the Delete Incomplete Items button.\n\n*Once Photos opens, go to Photos > Preferences > General tab and click on Use as System Photo Library. You will get a prompt about it turning off iCloud Photo Library. That's fine. Click OK.\n\n*Go to the iCloud tab in Preferences and turn iCloud Photo Library back on. It will act like it needs to upload files, and may take some time, but it shouldn't actually need to upload much since it's all already in iCloud.\n\nA: If you don't want any of your iCloud pictures on your computer.\nGo to System Preferences > iCloud and turn off iCloud Photo Library. If you click on the Options button in the category, you can turn off single parts of iCloud and keep others on.\nPhoto has it on > You deselect it obviously\n\nFrom Quora: How do I eliminate photos from my mac without eliminating them from icloud \n\nAlso see Apple's support article on how to Get help with your iCloud Photo Library\n\n", "Q: SSH No Longer Working After Sierra Update I'm trying to ssh into a remote server using the format: \nuser@ip -i ~/.ssh/path/to/key \n\nand I get the following error:\n/etc/ssh/ssh_config: line 55: Bad configuration option: gssapikeyexchange\n/etc/ssh/ssh_config: line 56: Bad configuration option: gssapitrustdns\n/etc/ssh/ssh_config: terminating, 2 bad configuration options\n\nConnecting to a server without an SSH key doesn't work either.\nThanks.\n\nA: Comment out or remove the lines\ngssapikeyexchange no\ngssapitrustdns no\n\nfrom your /etc/ssh/ssh_config and you should be good.\n\nA: If you need to use Kerberos (and hence the gssapi* options) a viable option is to copy an ssh executable from an older Mac (any version <= OpenSSH_6.7) should work.\ncp my-older-ssh /usr/local/bin/ssh\n\n", "Q: macOS Sierra - localhost stops working when virtual host is enabled I have enabled virtual hosts on my Mac running macOS Sierra.\nWhat I did,\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncommented Virtual Host line in httpd.conf\n\n*Added a virtual host entry from my site in /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file.\n\n\nAfter which when I try to access http://localhost it gives me a 404.\nInitially I faced a 403, so I created a username.conf file in apache users directory and gave AllowOverride All for /\nNow to access localhost I need to disable vhost. Any help? \n\nA: Probably you missed one or more modifications.

Then it disabled lots of modules in httpd.conf (which is typical for some reason after a OS X upgrade).  And then Apache kept silently crashing ... totally bewildering me.\n$ ps ax | grep http\n\n  [ no http was listed! ]\n\n# tail -f  /var/log/system.log\n\n  [ this showed that apache2 was attempting to restart every 10 seconds ]\n\n# apachectl\n\n  [ this showed the missing log directory error ]\n\nSomehow during OS X upgrade, it kept a vhost I had made directly in httpd.conf (not typically wise, better to put custom stuff extra directory), and that vhost had a non-standard logging folder.  OS X upgrade deleted that custom logging folder (odd that it would do that actually), and so upon restart it was silently failing since the log path had become invalid for the custom vhost I had in httpd.conf \nI created directories to honor that non-standard logging folder.  Huzzah, within 10 seconds apache2 had restarted and normal-ness returned.  I still had to enable modules again in httpd.conf, also uncomment several lines to pull in additional configurations from extra.  But once web server is running, a quick browser check to see what sites were still unreachable (or being redirected) allowed those config lines to be restored.\n\nA: Thanks, this works. But if you are trying to access PHP website then you have to load libexec/apache2/libphp5.so module. Just uncomment:\nLoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so\n", "Q: Hard Drive is not showing up on my Mac Laptop I have recently formatted my hard drive through disk utility and trying to reinstall OS X through the recovery mode but it comes up with the attached picture and the laptop is not going to its Recovery mode. Also i have realised when i press alt Key during the boot process i dont see any hard drive there.   \n\nA: This occurs when there is no information on any hard drive that the computer can process. This means that at some point you likely accidentally deleted the recovery partition of your hard drive. There is no regular recovery partition so the computer has no idea what to do.\nYou need to have a bootable USB drive to do anything with that computer besides use it as a very expensive paperweight. Find a USB drive and someone with a Mac and make yourself an OS X (or MacOS) install disk. Then boot from that drive (by holding down Option during boot). Then wipe your internal drive and install the OS (which will automatically install a recovery partition).\n", "Q: Is there anyway to avoid redundant cleanups of photos across apple devices? If I take a picture on my iPhone, it shows up when I open up \"Photos\" app on my mac when I click on \"Photos\" in the upper left.  This integration is quite nice to avoid having to do a manual sync but it has created a bit of overhead and confusion.\nIn most cases I like to groom my photos to get rid of lots of fuzzy or duplicate pictures but since it seems like a copy of the photo on my mac, If I cleanup these bad pictures on my iPhone, i also have to clean then up on my mac.\nFirst, I am trying to confirm that my mac has a \"copy\" of the picture (or a reference to the picture on the phone) and if I go and delete that picture on my phone, can I also get it to delete that picture on my mac.    \nIs this behavior configurable? \nI am trying to find a balance between enjoying the integration of things showing in mac photos without me having to do a manual sync with the overhead of doing these redundant cleanups.\n\nA: If using iCloud sync, deleting a photo on one device will generate an alert notifying you that you are removing it from ALL of your devices, not just that one. You shouldn't have to worry about manually rectifying changes between devices.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2015 install app on external drive including a cloud storage drive I would like to install MS Office 2016 on my MacBook Pro but there's not enough space. I thought of installing it on an external USB drive. However, I got an error message that \"Microsoft Office 2016 can't be installed on this disk. OS X isn't installed.\", and hence I couldn't install it.\nIs there anyhow to overcome this situation?\nI have one more question which is, is it possible to consider a cloud storage drive like Google Drive as a kind of USB and install an app on it?\n \n\nA: Install the application to Macintosh HD (your internal drive). Then go to your Applications folder, move the applications (after they've been installed) to the external drive. Test to make sure the apps on the drive open properly. Then delete the ones in the Applications folder.\nAddition: if you have a cloud storage service, you cannot install the apps onto it, but you can store some of your other documents there while you install MS Office on your internal drive.\n\nA: No, you can not. The very fact that it requires you to go through the install procedure means that there is more going on than just a file being copied over to your Applications folder. Things are being installed in your systems folders, which is the reason why you need to select a drive with Mac OS X installed.\nIf you were to do as @NoahL said in his answer, the program would only run on computers where the installer had been run in the past.\n\nA: You can!!(this mite not work but give it a try!!)\njust get a copy of mac os and get it on the dics and then get the app you want!\nThanks\n", "Q: If my iPhone is running iOS 10 and my home button breaks, do I lose the ability to make an emergency call? I understand I can't get make regular calls if it breaks (if I have enabled a passcode). This seems like a safety issue if even the emergency call feature is impossible to access if the button is broken.\nAm I missing a different way to access the emergency call feature?\n\nA: You will need to turn on AssistiveTouch prior to needing to call Emergency.  \nGo to Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> AssistiveTouch and turn it On.  This will show a screen overlay of several options, including the home button.  (You can also just tell Siri to turn on AssistiveTouch)\nWhenever you need to call Emergency, wake the iPhone the usual way and then tap the AssistiveTouch screen overlay and swipe to bring-up the ability to call Emergency.\n\nA: It depends on how the user has things set up as to what requires a passcode, but almost* anything that requires the user to unlock their device will result in an Emergency button being present on the screen. Generally swiping to the Today/widget screen and tapping on something that causes an app to try and open would result in a passcode screen.\nYou're correct in that it's not quite as intuitive as it was prior to iOS 10.\n* I did notice if you swipe right, to the Today/widget screen, tapping the Edit button at the bottom results in a passcode entry screen that does not have an Emergency button.\n\nA: On iOS 10, you can trigger a passcode request screen that has the Emergency button without using the home button by sliding over to the Widgets screen on the lock screen and tapping on any of Siri's app suggestions.\nThis method does not require assistive touch being set up, useful if your home button usually works but spontaneously breaks at the exact moment you need to make an emergency call (or if your hands are wet and the iPhone 7 home button can't determine your tap). \nHere's how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Edit at the bottom of the Today Widgets screen and make sure Siri App Suggestions is enabled as a widget. \n\n*From the lock screen, swipe in the direction that used to unlock the phone (on iOS 9), find the Siri App Suggestions widget, and hit any of the apps. A passcode request screen will pop up with the Emergency button.\n\n\n(Tested to work on an iPhone 6 running iOS 10.0.2)\n", "Q: No sound when iOS screen off and using Google Maps navigation? I'm using latest versions of iOS and Google Maps on an iPhone 7, and when I turn the screen off, I do not hear turn-by-turn directions when using the navigation feature of Google Maps. Yet, according to the \"Battery saving tips\" of the Google Maps app documentation, I should still hear the sounds.\nI verified this by turning off the screen (pushing power button) a few seconds before the next turn navigation came up. Then verified it was working by leaving the screen on for the next turn. The phone is not connected to any bluetooth devices either.\nAlso, the Google Maps settings all seem to indicate that sounds are all enabled properly (volume icon on map is set to \"unmuted\"; under navigation settings, all relevant-looking settings are enabled; etc.). \nAny ideas why this would not be working for me? I've yet to try a restart of phone nor have I tried a reset of phone. (Will eventually try those if no other suggestions come up.)\nUpdate: I also just tried re-navigating to new location; I turned screen off in the middle of the, \"okay navigation all set\" message. Then, the \"you're on the fastest route\" message played while screen off, but then all the directions no longer play, so issue still happening.\nUpdate 2: I disabled bluetooth and restarted the phone, and the problem still exists. The voice directions also do not play when I have a different app in focus.  I'll try a fresh install of Google Maps at some point soon.\n\nA: There is a setting in it somewhere to allows notifications when in standby. \n", "Q: How to preserve tray icon position on reboot? The issue seems to occur after updating to macOS Sierra.\nAfter the update, the position of the tray icons changed (from what they had been before the update). Redragging them works, but they are reset to this certain position if the system is rebooted. This didn't seem to happen before upgrading to Sierra. (Either that or the icons are somehow always placed to the position I wanted whenever I install new applications, which is unlikely)\nIs there a way to make the tray icon positions persist on reboot?\nI have Bartender 2 installed, but I don't think it is causing the issue.\n\nA: The issue occurs when using iStat Menus v5.2 (or older?) on macOS Sierra.\nThis issue is addressed in iStat Menus 5.3.\n", "Q: Will the battery from an iPhone 4 fit an iPhone 5 Will the battery from an iPhone 4 fit into an iPhone 5? The battery in my iPhone 5 is bad and I have an iPhone 4 I was thinking of exchanging the battery from.\n\nA: This is not something I would even try to do. \nThe batteries on iPhones are designed for the particular model they're officially compatible with. Even an iPhone 5 battery is not compatible with an iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c. Likewise, the battery used for the iPhone 4 16GB and 32GB models is not officially compatible with the iPhone 4 8GB model (launched later).\nIn your example, they are also different in physical size and if you've ever seen the inside of an iPhone you will know how all the parts are designed to fit in perfectly with each other - even a fraction of a millimetre can make all the difference.\nThe above should be enough reason not to, but in addition to this, the actual specs of the batteries are different.\nIn a nutshell, it will be easier and cheaper in the end to just buy a replacement battery rather than do what you're suggesting. You can buy replacement batteries on eBay or specialist sites such as iFixit US, iFixit Europe or Macfixit Australia.\nAlso, if your iPhone 4 is still in working order, you never know when you may need it again (or need to lend it to someone else).\n[EDIT]\nI just realised I forgot to mention that you may be eligible for a replacement battery as part of an Apple recall program. To check if you are, refer to this info on Apple's website.\n", "Q: iOS 10 Music App: \"Add to up Next\"? The iOS 10 Music app is revised and I had to get used to the new layout, thus investing some time in finding things.\nHowever, I am pretty clueless on where to find the Add to Up Next feature. There is the Play Next feature, but this doesn't allow me to add the selected song to the bottom of the queue. Using this on selected songs will essentially reverse the order of selected songs.\nWhere can I find the Add to Up Next feature on iOS 10 Music app?\n\n\nA: There appears to be a bug in the way the iOS 10 Music app handles this. However, there is a workaround that will get you by until Apple fixes it.\nTake these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the Up Next screen\n\n*Turn off the Shuffle function\n\n*Completely close down the Music App (don't just exit)\n\n*Launch the Music App again\n\n*Use 3D Touch (press firmly) on a song and select the Play Next option\n\n*Now use 3D Touch again, but on another song, and you'll see the Play Later option. \n\n*Select Play Later to add that song to the bottom of your Up Next queue.\n\n*Now the Play Later option will be there for all following songs.\n\n\nHowever, the reason this is a workaround is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*you no longer have the Shuffle function available to you.\n\n*I'm not sure what the workaround is if you have a device without 3D Touch\n\n\nTo have this whole issue fixed, send feedback to Apple.\n\nA: I have an iPhone 6 and all I had to do was quit the app, add a song using Play Next, then I could add any songs I wanted using Play Later. I think the Play Later feature doesn't show if you just press on a song to play instantly, because I pressed on a song in my playlist and it adds all the other songs after it in that playlist into the Up Next list. \n", "Q: Is there a firewall on an iPad on iOS 10, and is it configurable? I have an iPad Air 2. I've been using a comic book reader called Bookman for years. It allows importing books over FTP on a set port (2121). It has worked for years without an issue, but ever since I updated to iOS 10.0.2, I keep getting \"ECONNREFUSED - Connection refused by server\" trying to connect to the iPad's IP. \nA ping to the iPad's IP works, and connecting to another app that uses port 80 works. I verified it's not a client side issue, by trying from several machines. At this point, I think something in iOS is blocking the port.\nIs there a firewall, or any other configurable part that I can allow traffic through?\n\nA: There is no firewall on iOS and it does not block any ports that I am aware of.\nI'd guess your issue has more to do with the fact that Bookman hasn't been updated in over three years and some change in iOS 10 finally broke it. I'm actually shocked it works at all.\nIt sounds like you can use iTunes file sharing as an alternative, presuming that a recent iTunes update hasn't caused that to stop working with this particular app.\n", "Q: How to make a portable, cross-platform, TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt USB stick? I'm using VeraCrypt, a fork of TrueCrypt.  TrueCrypt had a mode called \"Traveller Mode\" on Windows, that allows for the encrypted volume/file to be accessed without requiring an installation of TrueCrypt itself.\nUnfortunately this functionality is not in the Mac version (nor is it in VeraCrypt).  I want to have a USB stick that will be accessible on both Mac and Windows (with the password), without anyone having to install anything first.\nI have tried creating two volumes using FAT format - 1 that is encrypted and 1 smaller one that is not, then placing a copy of the installed VeraCrypt.app onto the unencrypted volume.  Unfortunately that copy of the app crashes when launched on a computer without VeraCrypt installed.\nIs there a way to create a portable, cross platform, encrypted USB stick with VeraCrypt or TrueCrypt on a Mac running OSX Mavericks and if so, what is it?\n\nA: Format the stick in FAT format, then create truecrypt image on it. \n", "Q: Can't restore disabled iPhone because not enough disk space I am trying to restore a disabled iPhone 4s so my daughter can use it but iTunes gives the error not enough disk space. Obviously I can't delete anything from the phone because it's disabled. Is there any way to clear up storage space while disabled?\n\nA: When connecting it to iTunes, I would choose to set it up as a new device, rather than restoring from a backup.\nOnce you've done that then do the restore on your iPhone from the backup you wanted to use.\nNOTE: Ensure that you do not do a new backup of your iPhone 4s before doing the restore. You may want to make a backup of your iPhone 4s backup before you begin, just in case. If you're not sure of where the backups are located, refer to this article.\n\nA: If you are certain that you do not want to use any of the content already on the iPhone, you can place it into Recovery Mode and have iTunes restore it. Make sure that you have the Apple ID and password of the account that was on the phone before following the steps below otherwise you will still be unable to use the device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPhone in to your computer and ensure iTunes is open and can recognise the device.\n\n*Press and hold both power and home buttons at the same time until the screen goes black.\n\n*Continue holding both buttons for 4 seconds after the screen goes black.\n\n*Release the power button and continue holding the home button until iTunes recognises it. \n\n\nThe device will be recognised as \"in recovery mode\" and iTunes will give you the option to restore it. iTunes will then download the most recent software for that device and restore it, wiping the device and displaying the first-time setup for iOS.\n", "Q: How Do I restore my computer's SSD to a new larger SSD? I originally prepped the new Crucial 2 TB SSD in disk utility. I then removed the Mac 1 TB SSD from out of my MacBook Pro and put them both in my Aleratec duplicator. I proceeded to copy. This process seemed to work, however I had 1 TB of free space that was unaccessible. I was unable to move/add that space to the logical volume. I attempted to resize the logical volume but had -5341 error. Partition map to small. After several attempts at this I erased the new 2 TB SSD. \nWhat type of partition or set up would I need to do to restore the Mac 1 TB SSD to the 2 TB SSD. And what process is recommended for doing so? Use the duplicator or restore in Disk Utility? \nWhat I thought would be an easy upgrade is turning into nightmare. Does there need to be more then 1 partition on the 2 TB SSD?\n\nA: You will need to repair the partition map. Disk utility only works within it's known partition maps. You disk duplicator probably didn't do it right. Instead, format the disk again and use disk utility to clone it. You can use the restore functionality for that.\n\nA: No. (And yes! see below?)\nVery superficially spoken: A 2TB disk can hold only 1 partition occupying all available space. Technically: there are typically two more, small, partitions on a typical Apple setup: EFI for booting and Recovery HD for, well recovery.\nSo that is not the issue here. Partitions can very well be larger than 1TB for macOS.\nThe issue you see here is probably that the cloning was done not with high level Mac software like Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper or something similar like rsync, but with a tool that starts on a deeper level, like dd or Clonezilla.\nThat means that the old, smaller partition got duplicated – with its size information – to the new driv; leaving you with witnessing a large chunck of unused space on that drive.\nTo remedy this situation you can either resize the now used partition to grow to the desired size – over the unused free space –  using /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility or gparted or Stellar Partition Manager.\nIf none of the tools in the paragraph above are available it is still possible to clone – not the old drive, as an image, but the contents of the  old drive – to the new drive; formatted to your liking. \nSince Disk Utility got severely crippled in newer versions of OS X/macOS the recommendation for inexperienced users would have to go to some kind of third party tool like Carbon Copy Cloner.\n", "Q: speedup macOS Sierra startup I just installed MacOS Sierra on my macBookPro , I realised startup is slower than in Mavericks, can anyone direct me how can I or what Can I do to speed up boot and after booth startup. My MacBook RAM is 4GB, I hope this is not a problem otherwise.\n\nA: I don't know if this is reliable, but I saw on macxdvd.com (I am not recommending their software) that if boot time is slow on Sierra, to try the following:\n\nMany users reported that updated macOS Sierra boot-up time increased a lot. How to speed up macOS Sierra? It's quite easy. Head to System Preferences > Startup Disk > primary disk and click \"Restart\" the Mac computer. If it doesn't fix slow Mac macOS Sierra after upgrading to macOS Sierra, reset PRAM.\n\nApple has instructions to reset PRAM:\n\nShut down your Mac.\nLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R. \n  Turn on your Mac.\nPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound.\nHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time.\nRelease the keys.\nAfter resetting NVRAM, you may need to reconfigure settings for speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, and time zone information.\n\nPlease comment if this had any effect.\n\nA: I had the same problem with MacbookPro 2015 and tried the soft reset as mentioned - but it did not help. I solved the issue by starting my computer using the safe mode as described by Apple support. In short: turn off your computer and restart it. Immediately after hearing the startup sound press and hold the shift key. Release when Apple logo appears. Thus the system will try to fix directory issues and your screen will blink and look funny for few seconds...Then you can restart the computer as usual and hopefully be happy again.\n\nA: Get an SSD!

Is there a way to change the iTunes Store country and still keep the Apple Music library? Preferably in an automated way.\nThe reason for asking is that the Apple support article on changing the iTunes Store country or region says that your Apple Music library will be lost if changing the country and does not offer any workarounds:\n\nYou won’t see the items from your iCloud Music Library that you matched,\n  uploaded, or added from the previous country’s store\n\nI have spent considerable time on building up my music library (adding from Apple Music) and would not like to lose it just because I'm moving to another country.\nIn my case it is not an option to use multiple Apple IDs or keep using the old iTunes Store country. Device versions are iOS 10 and macOS Sierra.\n\nA: In theory if you have a friend who has an iphone and apple music and you both upgrade to iOS 11 then you can follow each other’s apple music playlists then get your friend to save and add your songs and playlists to their device, then on your device switch over app store countries, re subscribe to apple music in the new country and then do the reverse and follow your friends playlists and re add them back to your apple music library.\n\nA: iCloud Music Library is, as the name implies, a cloud service. Unlike a service running on a local machine which might have the possibility of being overridden when Apple states it can't do something, there is no way to change what happens on their servers. They say it's no longer accessible after a country change, and that's what it means.\nIf you are changing to a country where you can use Apple Music, any music that you still have can be matched/re-uploaded after you change your country. This may not be ideal, but it's the only way to re-establish your library after a country change.\n\nA: A pretty detailed write-up of the issues with doing this here:\nhttps://www.jordanmerrick.com/2016/02/itunes-border-control/\n\nA: best advice i can give is have someone who is on the country you was originally on send you an app from the app store via the share feature. once you hit \"Get\" it will prompt you to \"Change the app store to the country you originally was on . Instead of going through that long process. I just did it for myself so i can GUARANTEE IT WORKS! \n\nA: I was trying to download music the other day and i kept on getting this \"Can't change Country/Region after cancel Apple Music membership\" which was annoying and after tedious attempts, I tried this instead of going to to iTunes and trying to change the store there, try to download and install a free app and immediately you will be prompted with pop-up that has a Change option. Click it and as soon as the app can download you're home free.\n", "Q: Verbose Mode is dropped on macOS Sierra? \nHi guys,\nAnyone know if Apple removed Verbose Mode in macOS Sierra or not? When It seems Verbose Mode couldn't be accessed any more.\nOne more thing, it also doesn't work with booting into Single-user Mode, Safe Mode or Verbose Mode via command line.\nAny reply would be appreciated. Thanks.\nBest Regards,\nVincent\n\nA: System Integrity Protection (SIP) disables changes to NVRAM. In order to make changes, you need to temporarily disable SIP by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode. (Hold Command-R from the time you start your machine until the Apple logo appears.)\n\n*Open the Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\n*Enter the command:\ncsrutil disable\n\n\n*Reboot and you will be able to run your desired commands from within a normal session.\n\n*It's strongly recommended that you re-enable SIP when you're done making adjustments. To do so, run this command:\ncsrutil enable\n\nNote that if you intend to make a lot of changes to NVRAM, you can leave SIP enabled but disable NVRAM protection by running the following command from the Recovery Mode Terminal:\ncsrutil enable --without nvram\n\nAgain, you will need to reboot for changes to be effective.\n\nA: As best I can tell in Sierra, it is still possible to:\n sudo nvram boot-args=\"-v\"\nwithout disabling SIP.\nHowever, the interesting thing is that while Vervose mode works at boot as it always has, it no longer displays anything at shutdown.\n\nA: I came across this page while looking for something related. In my case I needed to be in Verbose mode in Mojave, and it seemed like neither command-s or command-v worked. But I did find an answer elsewhere to the problem.\nAs was said, using command-r and then Terminal from the Utilities menu will give you single user mode.\nFor Verbose mode, the significant change is when you have used FileVault, which was the case for my work machine. Instead of letting go of the keys at the Apple logo stage, you keep holding them until you get to the log in stage. Then sign in as usual, and after the log in screen goes away you see the usual thousands of lines scrolling by.\n", "Q: Need Help Saving iTunes Preferences I have just bought a new iMac. I have iTunes installed on my new computer. All my iTunes preferences are set perfectly on my old iMac. I now want to move my external hard drives to my new iMac. This is where all my iTunes music stored. There is one slight problem... I can easily connect the hard drives to my new iMac... One thinks that just locating the names of the hard drives and taking your mouse and sliding the folders into iTunes will all arrange the albums and all the tracks with all the album names and artists and everything goes in it's right place... Wrong... Doesn't work that way. There is a way to copy your iTunes preferences so that when you attach your hard drives the first time your iTunes program knows exactly where to find everything and everything is in it's place. Someone out there must know. I used to do it all the time but now I have not done it in like 3 years... Someone help!\n\nA: Generally, even when the actual song files are located on another drive like you state yours is, the iTunes library is still in the ~/Music/iTunes folder on your main computer drive. You can usually get there in Finder by clicking on Music in the sidebar.\nCopy the above folder (iTunes) from your old computer to your new one, making sure to put it in the same place. If you already opened iTunes on the new computer, there will probably already be an iTunes folder there, and it's okay to drag it to the trash.\nOnce you've copied the folder over and you plug in your external hard drive, open iTunes while holding the Option key on the keyboard. When you see a message that asks you to Choose iTunes Library, click Choose Library. Navigate to the Music folder and select iTunes. At this point it may take a few minutes for iTunes to load, depending on the size of your library, but everything should be in place.\n", "Q: How to check the VPN setting created by an app on an iOS device? Many VPN apps would create VPN profiles on the iOS device. Unlike VPN profiles create by the user, they cannot be edited, and therefore the user cannot see the setting of said profile. With a jailbroken device, is there a way to hunt down such profile and read the setting in file?\n\nA: Yes you can on a jailbroken iPhone using an app called OpenSSH.\nIt will allow you access to all the system files and in normally conditions you can simple change the extension to .txt and open it with textedit for example.\nWhat you’ll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*A jailbroken iPhone/iPod Touch with Cydia installed.\n\n*OpenSSH Cydia Package.\n\n*Wi-Fi and Internet access on the device.\n\n*Mac/PC on the same Wi-Fi connection\n\n*Suitable FTP/SSH clients like Cyberduck, Transmit etc.\n\n\nHere is the guide on CultofMac\nAlso a link to the OpenSSH Cydia Package\nBasic Instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the OpenSSH package\n\n\n*\n\n*(click, Install, Confirm, Close, Back)\n\n\n*open Wi-Fi from Settings\n\n*click your network's \n\n*read the \"IP Address\" field\n\n\n*\n\n*(example: 192.168.1.100)\n\n\n*open Terminal on desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*(open Spotlight, search for \"Terminal\")\n\n*Or if you're on Windows, you can use a desktop terminal application such as PuTTY(http://www.putty.org/).\n\n\n*run \"ssh root@[insert IP Address]\"\n\n\n*\n\n*(example: ssh root@192.168.1.100)\n\n\n*wait a few minutes (just once)\n\n\n*\n\n*(it's generating some crypto keys)\n\n\n*accept new computer host key\n\n\n*\n\n*(if it doesn't ask you, that's fine)\n\n\n*log in with password \"alpine\"\n\n\n*\n\n*(you should change this now)\n\n\n\nA: You won't need to use OpenSSH at all whatsoever.

However the Mac App Store allows downloading it. \nI would like to prevent downloading 5GB of files and finally discover that the installer says \"your mac is not supported\".\n\nA: Officially your MacBook Pro (13\" Mid-2009) is not supported by macOS Sierra. However, for whatever reason, the option to upgrade to macOS Sierra is appearing in the App Store for a whole range of unsupported Macs. In fact, today I saw this occur on a MacBook Pro (15\" Late-2008) model that was running Snow Leopard 10.6.8, even though Apple doesn't officially support upgrading from this hardware or OS.\nAs to whether you can install it, the answer is yes, even though this isn't officially supported by Apple. If the App Store allows you to download the upgrade, then you could just download it (without installing it) and then make a copy of the installer. Once you've got a copy you could try installing from the original downloaded location to see what happens. If this doesn't work you can download the macOS Sierra Patcher Tool for Unsupported Macs. Make sure you read all the information on this page as it contains important information you should weigh up before proceeding. If it was me I would not proceed without a full backup ready so you could recover your system if all goes bad.\nIn the end, whether you should download the upgrade is up to you. Do you want macOS Sierra? Many of its new features are not supported even on Macs that are officially supported by the upgrade - so the answer to this will depend on what appeals to you in upgrading to macOS Sierra? To help you decide, go to Upgrade to macOS Sierra and scroll down to the Feature Requirements section.  \nIf what appeals to you isn't likely to work because it's only supported on much newer Mac models, then I wouldn't bother.\n\nA: I tried it with the PC of a friend of mine and after downloading appeared:\"your mac is not supported\".\nfollowing an explanation from the website www.trustedreviews.com\nDespite Apple's guidance that it's only late-2009 devices and onwards that will be able to run the OS, theoretically you should be able to run Sierra on computers with a CPU utilising the Penryn microarchitecture.\nRelated: How to download macOS Sierra right now\nOf course, just because it's possible doesn't mean it's straightforward, which is why developer Colin Mistr (aka dosdude1) created the macOS Sierra Patch Tool.\nThat utility, along with a USB drive with a capacity of at least 8GB and a copy of Sierra, should let you install macOS on that handful of older devices.\nAll the usual caveats apply: installing macOS Sierra on an unsupported computer could bork it (and your data), as well as likely voiding your warranty.\nOn certain devices, too, the workaround will kill your Wi-Fi functionality. These are the late-2008 and mid-2009 MacBook Air, early-2008 and mid-2008 MacBook Pro, early-2008 iMac and early-2008 Mac Pro.\nIn other words, you should have bit of technical know-how if you're going to try this, and backup all your data first. While we know this worked on Sierra dev previews, we're also unsure if Apple has managed to patch the borderline 'hack', so let us know your mileage in the comments below.\nIf you do want to give it a go, though, you can find step-by-step instructions and download the macOS Sierra Patch tool here\n", "Q: How can I make Caps Lock work like it did prior to Sierra? Downloaded and installed macOS Sierra (10.12) on 10/1/16.\nSince then, my Caps Lock key is behaving weirdly different (I'm an OS X user since Mavericks).\nNote: This only seems to affect users with more than one language as their input source.\nExplanation: Caps Lock simply does not work when a (update: Non-Latin language) language other than English (in my case, Hebrew, an RTL language) is set as the input language. When that's the case and Caps Lock is pressed, it simply blinks for a second and then turns off again, but then and turns off. Even when I am able to turn it on, it doesn't have the same effect (all keys behave as if Caps Lock is off)\nWhy is this bad: Just a small example — take a look at the bottom-right key, which is ? (or / when Caps Lock is on). When Hebrew is selected, it's actually a period (.) and that is normal. Prior to Sierra, I could press the Shift key to get a ? and hold Caps Lock to get /. Right now I can't use  / when I'm typing in a language other than English because Caps Lock doesn't work. \nNote that Caps Lock works just as expected when English is set as the input source.\n\nA: I think I may have found the solution:\nIt appears that in Sierra, the \"default\" behavior that I described above is possible, and is now \"a feature\". Only problem is it's turned-off by default (which is plain ludicrous). \nThere is now a new option in the input sources screen, which, when turned on, reverts the behavior to the desired one. \n\nThe Caps Lock key longer turns green when non-Latin languages are used, but the keys behave as expected. There's the annoying symptom of accidental switching between languages for those who use Caps Lock to Capitalize in English. Luckily for me at least, I switched to Shift for that early on.\n\nA: You can have the old behavior back if you create a duplicate Hebrew keyboard with Ukelele and use that instead of Apple's\n", "Q: Localhost refuses to connect after upgrading to Sierra OS I have downloaded and installed apache, php, phpmyadmin, mysql via macports.

The problem is main /etc/ file. \nReplace The Hosts File\nYou can download a default Mac OS hosts file from http://cs.us.extensis.com/HostsFile/hosts.zip.\nUnzip the hosts file; it should have no file extension\nIn the Finder, go to Go > Go to Folder\nFor “Go the the folder” enter “/etc” and press Enter\nDrag the hosts file into the etc folder; enter a Mac OS administrator username and password when asked\nOnce you have placed the hosts file in the etc folder:\nOpen the Terminal application\nEnter the following command and press Enter: sudo chmod 644 /etc/hosts\nEnter your Mac OS password and press Enter\nYou may see bullets, key icons, or nothing as you type your Mac OS password into the Terminal window, depending on the version of Mac OS you are using. This is normal.\nClear Your Mac OS DNS Cache\nIn the Terminal window, enter the following command and press Enter: sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\nRestart your Mac\nCause\nSuitcase Fusion uses the hosts file to find and connect to the type core using the loopback address (127.0.0.1 or localhost). If the hosts file is not present, or the entry for 127.0.0.1 points to a name other than localhost, you will see one of the error messages displayed above.\nIf Suitcase Fusion cannot resolve localhost to 127.0.0.1, you will get the first error message; if the type core cannot resolve localhost to 127.0.0.1, you will get the second error message.\nIf the hosts file has been modified, it may be removed when upgrading to a new version of Mac OS. Third-party applications or network utilities may incorrectly change the localhost entry as well.

Or are there some mixups with the updated OS Sierra system files?\nI don't need the installer to use disk space, but of course don't want to crash my System by accidently removing something from ~/Library or wherever and then stand there with an unusable system.\nAnyone already made some experiences with this?\nCheers,\nTobias\n\nA: OS X Installer files are automatically deleted from Applications as part of the install process. Normally, it shouldn't need moving there, App Store ought to put it there directly as part of the download process.\nThey are very unlikely to have any 'related files' of the type that AppCleaner could find.\nIf you did want to keep a copy for the future, then you need to copy it outside Applications before running the Installer.\n", "Q: How to find \"file-release\" in OS X El Capitan 10.11.6?

However, after charging it I still had the same issue.\nSo, I took it to a repair person whom I know and he told me it's some issue on the motherboard. Now I am not very sure how accurate his diagnosis is.\nDoes anybody here know of or have a similar issue concerning MacBooks? Can anyone share some information on this?\n\nA: Have you tried resetting the SMC?\nReset the SMC\nIt's easy to reset your computer's System Management Controller (SMC). The instructions for resetting the SMC on a MacBook depends on two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does your device run from a removable battery? (Yes in your case)\n\n*Does your device run from a built-in battery?\n\n\nNow, for the sake of others who may come here looking for answers to the same issue, I will provide the process for both. \nFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nHope this helps. Please report back and let us know.\nReset your PRAM/NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\n\nA: the issue is with either your SMC, or the LION charging system, it is possible that the computer is not aware of the battery, boot up the computer, and click on the battery icon, does it give a battery status?\nTake it to a professional! Apple computers are complicated, and you should not be trusting your very expensive Mac with someone you do not trust. \nNo doubt Louis Rossman will have a video about this... \n", "Q: Does Find My Mac work if the disk gets erased? My MacBook Pro was stolen a couple of days ago and Find my Mac had been enabled on it. I have already locked the Mac with a passcode and a message as well as clicked on the play sound feature(on the find my iPhone app), but those actions are pending until the computer comes online. The Mac is on El Capitan and came with Mavericks. The admin user is password protected but I had not enabled FileVault which is the disk encryption feature, so the computer can be wiped by erasing the disk in Recovery. The computer doesn't need to connect to the internet to be erased but it does need an internet connection to reinstall the operating system after the wipe. My question is, if the computer is erased and then goes online, will Find my Mac still work and notify me when it does? Is it still asociated with my Apple ID after the wipe?\n\nA: As long as the thief does not manually clear the NVRAM in any way, or reconfigures iCloud with another account, the device can still be tracked when online.\nsee this answer\n", "Q: Verification Failed.

When I go onto my iCloud on my iPhone it says that my email is not verified even though I went to my email and verified it, it isn't recognized as verified on my iPhone.\n\nA: This was driving me crazy! Accidentally the \"set time/date automatically\" had been turned off and the date was way off. Turning this back on made everything work again!

Once I updated the time and date correctly all verification worked.\n\nA: This could be caused by a number of scenarios. One of the most common things to check is whether you're actually connected to the internet (preferably WiFi)? I have seen many people not realise they weren't connected, especially after an iOS update.\nIn addition, two of the most common things to try are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Doing a full reboot of your iPhone (i.e. holding down the Power and Home buttons simulatenousy for about 10 secs until you see the Apple logo on a black screen)\n\n*Logging out and back in. (See steps below)\n\n\nYou don't actually clarify what version of iOS you're running, but here are some generic steps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings >iTunes & App Store\n\n*Tap on your Apple ID at the very top\n\n*Tap on Sign Out\n\n*Now sign back in\n\n\nHope this helps. Let us know you go, as there are other possible ways to fix this.\n\nA: If you had previously installed OPENDNS/Cisco Umbrella Disable it and reinstall it.

The connector of which I speak is like this:\nThis type of connector is used only by Apple or other companies are using? It is their patent?\n\nA: These connectors are not given a particular generic name by Apple beyond just \"cable connector\". In their service manuals, the cable connectors are differentiated by referring to what they're connecting. For example, here is a quote from one of their service manuals:\n\nDisconnect the battery cable connector from the logic board, taking\n  care to keep the cable connector flat when pulling it out of its mate.\n  Use your thumb on top and a black stick beneath to prevent too much\n  bend in the cable. An alternative is to use your index fingers (and\n  nails) to grab the sides of the connector and pull straight out, level\n  with the board.\n\nNOTE: Bold emphasis added by me.\nSo, these cable connectors are referred to as various names, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery cable connector\n\n*Audio cable connector\n\n*Microphone cable connector\n\n\nOften these cables are known as Halogen-free cables and connectors. These cables/connectors are delicate and you must handle them with care to avoid damage.\nAlso, since the image in your question isn't labelled, I should point out that there are also various other cables/connectors in a MacBook, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*LVDS cable\n\n*Port hatch flex connector\n\n*Hard drive flex cable\n\n\nAnd the list goes on.\nHope this helps and answers your question.

I did a factory reset. However, so far, what did they have access to?\n\n\n*\n\n*My passcode?\n\n*My keyboard?\n\n*My applications (I did not enter their password after installing the profile)?\n\n\nIn general, what maximum activities and information do they have access to?\n\nA: The profile can only see your Unique Device Identifier. Nothing else. \n\nA: Yikes! Glad you got it removed...\nIt really depends on the profile that you installed. Some profiles will enroll you into an MDM server (Mobile Device Management), where they can run reports on things like the serial number, UDID, MAC Address, apps installed, certificates installed, any restrictions (simple passcode, max failed attempts, etc.), and so on. Worst-case-scenario, they can install apps remotely, lock or even wipe your phone. Not to mention Activation Lock (Find my iPhone).\nOther profiles don't go that far but will change settings (such as setup an email account or proxy settings).\nThey can't see your passcode or have access to your keyboard. Although I believe someone could create and install a malicious app that looks harmless and asks for some info (passcode, iCloud account name/password, etc.).

I've downloaded iOS 10—what else do I need to do to see the messages?\n\nA: It's likely because you didn't like those zoom effects in iOS 7... \nYou'll need to turn off \"Reduce Motion\" in Settings app > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. Then your incoming Messages effects should go off as planned.\n\nHeads up: This will re-enable the parallax icon effect on the home screen (where the background moves behind the icons).

I can access this disk from my mac finder and see all the files.\nI want to add these files to my itunes home videos folder without physically copying the files from the wifi disk.\nI thought the right way to do this was to open itunes movies -> home videos then drag and drop the files from the finder on the home videos.\nbut in my case, it starts physically copying 100s of those files from the wifi disk to the local storage of the computer.\nI don't want this.\nI want itunes to just use the wifi disk. I know this is possible and I have done it from other computers.... but right now I am not able to do this.\n\nA: iTunes menu > Preferences > Advanced tab > uncheck \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder ...\"\nNote this will disable it for music and other media, too. If you want to keep using it for music and other media, disable the option, add all your videos, then re-enable it. iTunes will then keep track of the fact that the videos are in one place, and your music will still be copied into the iTunes Media folder when added in the future.\nIf you do this, do not select File > Library > Consolidate Files, or it will attempt to copy all your videos into the iTunes Media folder.\n\nA: In recent macOS versions (12.3.1 at time of writing) we use the \"TV\" app. And while holding down the option key, we drag the movie file into Library > Home Videos section of the TV app. It should keep the file from copying anywhere such that playback is done from the source location.\n", "Q: Why is there no 'Recovery HD' listed when holding 'option' on startup, however, 'Recovery HD' is shown in terminal with 'diskutil list' command?

I have just updated to MacOS Sierra, and found that openssh version 1 has beed disabled or removed.\nssh1 is not supported\n\nI have to use ssh1 for some server, how can I enable ssh1?\nOr can I install another openssh which support ssh1 tentatively?\n\nA: Here's my github repo trying to solve the problem by patching the openssh in homebrew/dupes. It's far from perfect but works.\nBasically you have to:\nbrew tap homebrew/dupes\ncurl -fsSL https://github.com/boltomli/MyMacScripts/raw/master/homebrew/homebrew-dupes.openssh.diff | patch /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-dupes/openssh.rb\nbrew install openssh --with-ssh1\n\n\nA: Please note that openssh also incorrectly displays this error when connecting to a firewalled port or a port without sshd listening.\nIn my case I got this error on MacOS when I mistakenly used \"ssh -P5363 ...\" instead of \"ssh -p5356 ...\"\n\nA: curl/patch line from above slightly modified to run on macOS Sierra...\ncurl -fsSL https://github.com/boltomli/MyMacScripts/raw/master/homebrew/homebrew-dupes.openssh.diff | patch /usr/local/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-dupes/openssh.rb\n\nA: openSSH has been moved from 'dupes' to 'core'.  boltomli has updated his GitHub repo to account for this.  Here is the new command to get it working on Sierra.\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boltomli/MyMacScripts/master/homebrew/homebrew-core.openssh.diff | patch /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/openssh.rb\nbrew install openssh --with-ssh1\n\n\nA: Given that ssh1 is absolutely ancient (v2 has been standard for 10 years now) a far better solution is upgrading the security on the server you access that is still running ssh1 only. V1 has all the usual security issues of 20 year old software, whoever is managing that particular piece of hardware is simply not doing their job.\nYou can probably install an alternate client that supports V1, but I would send a memo to management that they have a major issue with their legacy hardware.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro GPUs: overheating and noisy fans I'm sure everyone with a Macbook Pro has experienced the heavy heating and the fans sounding like they are about to take off. It's totally understandable when I run a GPU-heavy process such as video editing or gaming. My problem is that this is happening even with simple tasks such as web browsing or watching a video...\nMy understanding is that it is due to the Intel CPU doing all the work to save energy. Am I wrong? Then why even have a dedicated GPU! It's a shame that the algorithm to switch from CPU to GPU is not smart enough to avoid the overheating issues. \nSo I have two questions:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I've read that the Automatic Graphics Switching box in Parameters>Energy Savers lets you control if you want CPU/GPU or only GPU for all graphical computations. In the CPU/GPU mode, some algorithm (whitelist?) decides whether an application should run on the Intel or Dedicated GPU. Apparently it can't tell that Chrome should run on GPU rather than burning my laps... Is there a way to edit that list?\n\n*What is your software of choice to monitor/control this behavior? \nDo you manually check/uncheck the box throughout your day? I'm trying out iStats Menus which seems great for monitoring usage. I've heard about gfxCardStatus, is it usefull? And finally i've read about various fan control apps but is it really a good idea to prevent the CPU from cooling down?\n\nThis seems to be a case of Apple trying to hard to simplify something that really wasn't complicated: nowadays if you're buying a laptop with a dedicated GPU you probably understand well enough the difference between the Intel on-chip GPU  and a dedicated GPU performances to make this kind of decisions. \nThanks for your help!\n\nA: \nI'm sure everyone with a Macbook Pro has experienced the heavy heating and the fans sounding like they are about to take off.\n\nSure, but depending on what the Macbook is doing it could be normal behaviour.\nAlso some Macbooks heats more than others. What's yours?\nAnyway, there are two possible situations:\n1) you always experienced heating and loud fans:\nI would say it's normal behavior (but you can always try what suggested at (2) if you feel it's really too much heat/fans)\n2) heating and lound fans started at some point during the life of your macbook:\nTry to fix the problem\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure the macbook can cool down normally (fans exhaust grid are not obstructed)\n\n*reset the SMC (see other answer)\n\n*use Activity Monitor to check if there is a connection between overheating and specific application/processes\n\n*bring the macbook to apple service center\n\n\nMy problem is that this is happening even with simple tasks such as web browsing or watching a video...\n\nWeb browsing pages that use Flash or intensive JavaScript and/or watching videos can be CPU/GPU intensive tasks.\n\n\nMy understanding is that it is due to the Intel CPU doing all the work to save energy. Am I wrong?\n\nYes, you're wrong.\nMacbooks Pro have an integrated GPU (integrated into the CPU) and a discrete GPU.\nThe difference between the two is that the integrated GPU heats less, drain less power but has limited features and computational power than the discrete.\nWhen possible the OS uses the integrated GPU to save energy. When not possible (ex. you're using photoshop, you attach an external display,... ) the discrete is used and the MBP heats more.\nYou can see what GPU is used with gfxCardStatus\nThe Energy Saving GPU option tells the OS that you want to use the integrated GPU whenever possible.\n\nA: Have you tried resetting the SMC?\nReset the SMC\nIt's easy to reset your computer's System Management Controller (SMC). The instructions for resetting the SMC on a MacBook depends on two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does your device run from a removable battery? \n\n*Does your device run from a built-in battery?\n\n\nNow, because you haven't specified your model of MacBook Pro, I will provide the process for both. \nFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nHope this helps. Please report back and let us know.\nReset your PRAM/NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\n\nA: I first quit the dropbox app, because according to the activity monitor, that app used a lot of CPU. It helped, the noisy fans were a bit less erratic, but still they went on making noise and my mbp got hot. After I deleted all obscure apps (that sometimes come with visiting a website), it is all back to normal. \n", "Q: Where are digital touch messages kept? I have recently upgraded to iOS 10 and notice the new digital touch feature in Messages offers a \"keep\" button. Where are they kept? Can I see them in any other app, or do anything with them outside Messages? Can I export them? In what file format?\n\nA: The keep option simply means they are not removed from the conversation - just as with audio messages, it's a space-saving measure.\nYou can long-press on a digital touch item to get a Copy option. From there you can paste it anywhere that accepts photos as paste data (such as the input field in WhatsApp or Messenger, or an image editing app that supports it). Note this will copy it as an image, and not as a GIF/video that contains the motion present in the original.\n\nA: I've wondered this as well... I think they're kept in-line, meaning they stay in the iMessage thread rather than disappearing after the time expires.\n", "Q: Writing current date to plist file using the command line I'm trying to use this command to do so:\ndefaults write test.plist LatestDate date \"+%y-%m-%d\"\n\nwhere LatestDate is the key I'm modifying. The problem is, it doesn't recognize date \"+%y-%m-%d\" as what I'm trying to write to the key, and when I put it in quotes it simply writes that text, not the date to the key.\nHow should I go about doing this?\n\nA: In defaults, date is just an option, not the actual date command. You need to actually pass the date.\ndefaults write test.plist LatestDate \"$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S +0000')\"\n\n", "Q: How do I import an other family members photos to my iCloud account? My wife have a 16gb iPhone and her phone is now nearly full. I would like to import her photos to my iCloud account and free up some space on her phone. I have a 200GB subscription and she has a 50GB subscription the problem here is the phone's storage. \nHow can I import her photos to my iCloud account and move the photos off to her phone? \n\nA: There is no direct way to do what you want.\nYou don't state if you use iCloud Photo Library. If you don't, you can enable that and select the Optimize Device Storage option as @JaimeSantaCruz suggested. That will reduce the amount of space required on the device but will not eliminate it entirely.\nThere are a couple of workarounds but neither are ideal.\nYou could create a shared album, have her share everything she has on her device, then remove her from the shared album (and she can delete all the photos on her phone). The problem is that shared albums reduce the size of the pictures, so you won't be getting the originals.\nIf you have a Mac, the Photos app could be utilized, but it depends on your current set up. If she uses iCloud Photo Library already and the Mac is set to use the same iCloud account, everything should be in Photos already. If not, you'll need to hook up her iPhone to the Mac, and import everything. In either case, once everything is in Photos, you could copy all of the items into a new, non-iCL library (or an iCL library in a different user account that's hooked up to your Apple ID).\n", "Q: What does this symbol in iTunes mean? I saw this when backing up my iPhone, and I have no idea what it means. It is in the space where the X/cancel symbol usually is, and it had no tooltip when I hovered over it.\n\n\nA: This symbol appears during the process of syncing between an iPhone, iPad or iPod with iTunes on a Mac or PC. I can't recall the official name of this iTunes symbol, but I can tell you what it does.\nWhile iTunes is performing a sync it works through a number of steps. This symbol appears when the \"Backup up\" step commences (usually Step 2). By clicking on this symbol iTunes will skip this step and move on to the next step. In a nutshell it is a skip backup symbol, although I can't recall if that's the offical name.\nThis is a great option if you just want to quickly sync some purchases etc without waiting for iTunes to first do the backup, especially if you've recently done a backup or are in a real hurry.\n", "Q: OpenSSL not getting linked with homebrew on El Capitan 10.11.6 I am trying to code in C on OS X (El Capitan) and need to use OpenSSL.

I just upgraded to Sierra and now it has come back and the old way won't work anymore. \nAny one know why? Or what else I can do?\n\nA: @scottishwildcat is correct. Most of /System is off-limits to changes so long as System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled.\nYou can temporarily disable SIP by rebooting into Recovery Mode (press and hold Command-R from the time the computer starts until you see the Apple logo), then opening Terminal from the Utilities menu and entering this command:\ncsrutil disable\n\nReboot back into Recovery Mode and access the Terminal again. Enter your desired command, then enter this command to re-enable SIP:\ncsrutil enable\n\nReboot one more time into macOS as normal and AirPlayUIAgent should have the specified permissions.

I can see on the Apple store that the standard charger is a 12W charger.\nSince it \"should\" output 5V, I can conclude it outputs 2.4A (12W/5V=2.4A).\nConsidering the above hypothesis correct, could any charger having the same output be used for my iPhone 5? \n\nA: Yes, theoretically that's correct and there are thousands of chargers out there that will work with Apple products.  However, Apple includes specific components in their chargers to ensure their charging and communication protocols are followed.  They also have a licensing program for 3rd-party companies to manufacture and sell Apple-certified products, the MFI program. \nIf you are looking for charging devices not manufactured by Apple but still follow the Apple-certification process, make sure the products display the MFI certication logo (not the 'Compatible with iPhone' logo which actually means nothing).\n", "Q: Word 2016 - Can't save to AFP share (El Capitan) One of our macs running El Capitan mysteriously can't save Word 2016 documents to our AFP share anymore.\nMore specifically, when trying to save a Word 2016 document to our AFP share, the normal \"Save\" dialog pops up. After completing the dialog, Word dutifully closes it and then displays a \"Save as...\" dialog a short time later (with the file not having been saved to the share).

I'm reviewing some photos I've taken in the photos app on a Mac. I'd like to put some of them into an album. However, it seems that to do this, for every photo I want to add, I have to click the '+' button and select \"Album\", which then pops up a modal dialogue where I have to select the name of the album from yet another drop-down, then click OK. There must be a quicker way than this. (Right?) What is it?\nBy the way: I know that I can select several thumbnails at once using the CMD key, but the problem is my eyesight is really poor (hence squinting at thumbnails gives me a headache), and in any case I want to check the photos are sharp before I add them to the album. So I'm looking for a quick way to add the photo to an album from looking at the photo itself, not from the thumbnails page. If it can be done by keyboard shortcuts, that would be an acceptable solution.\n\nA: I'm assuming you're talking about the Photos app on Mac.\nOne option based on your description is to change the size of your thumbnail images so they're large enough to view the quality of images without having to manually open them up one by one. To change the thumbnail size drag the slider near the top left of the Photos app window.\nOnce you've got the size right, you can select multiple images (using the Command key) and then drag them across to the album you want. Of course, this assumes you've already created the album. \nAnother option, once you've selected the images you want, is to then go to File > New Album (or just use the CommandN keyboard shortcut) and this will automatically create a new album including all the photos you had selected.\nIf you're interested in the full list of keyboard shortcuts for the Photos app, just go to Help > Keyboard Shortcuts. This will give you quick access to a list of keyboard shortcuts as well as Magic Mouse or trackpad gestures.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Advisability of using a OneDrive folder mounted on external drive for Time Machine? I want to use a OneDrive folder as the location to which Time Machine backs-up my internal drive.

You're providing an invalid name for ::1 that is essentially disabling the entry.

Im thinking of buying a pair of Bose bluetooth headphones as the non-bluetooth pair I've used everyday for 5 years are dying.\nI really like the idea of no cables, but what happens if I walk out of range of my Macbook Pro or iPhone? Will the music start playing through the phone or computer (not very practical as I'm in an open plan office)\n\nA: SHORT ANSWER\nIn a nutshell, when I'm out of range the music does not start playing through the speakers of the connected device.\nLONG ANSWER\nI own a pair of Bose Bluetooth headphones that I've been using with an iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro and an iMac. I've had these for about 15 months and have been very happy with them.\nThe pair I own maintain a charge for about 7hrs and are able of being paired with 8 different devices. They can also be connected to two devices at the same time!\nNow that I've provided that context, my comments below will make more sense. \nIf I connect my Bose Bluetooth headphones to my iPhone for playing music they work great. If I move beyond a certain range, the music is no longer heard on the headphones, but as far as the iPhone is concerned the music is still playing. During this period, the music is not heard from the iPhone speaker. If I move the headphones further out of range so that the connection is totally lost, then the iPhone stops playing music altogether (i.e. the pause button becomes a play button again).\nHowever, I have had another issue that may or may not be relevant in your case. I also use my headphones for long phone calls when I work at home (usually 1 or 2 days per week). This works fine, however, if I happen to have another device within range that is also paired to my headphones (remember they can be paired to 8 devices, and connected to two devices simultaneously) then that other device may connect to my headphones. Once that happens, if I get a notification or if the other device was already playing music or a video, then this causes some sort of weird interference with my call. This interference was only happening when I was on a call, not if I was using them just to listen to music.\nNow, this issue may be peculiar to my set up as there are lots of variables involved, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*the model and specs of headphones\n\n*the model and specs of all the paired devices\n\n*how many devices you've paired\n\n*whether these devices are in range\n\n*what these devices are doing at the time\n\n\nIn my case, once I figured out what the problem was, I chose to 'forget' my headphones from the other devices and now only pair/connect to them on my iPhone (as that's what I use the headphones with for 95% of the time). And if I need to connect them to another device for a while, I just connect them then. This has worked very well for me, as I rarely need to use them with another device. \nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: AppStore is missing after updating to iOS 10 Just yesterday night I updated my iPhone with iOS 10.0.1 but after updating I have found that App Store is not there so I cannot download and install new apps .

Here is a screenshot showing approximately what you're working with:\n\nTo crop the clip, first select the clip in the timeline. Then, click the  icon above the video preview, select \"Crop to Fill\", and resize the rectangle as desired. To prevent it from snapping to the borders, hold the Command key as you drag. Below is an example of what this might look like—though I've cropped it much more than you will, most likely.\n\nFinally, here's what it should look like (I've selected the picture-in-picture tool to demonstrate the bounding box of the clip):\n\n", "Q: Can I hide a drive from the filesharing network, even from admin acct?

I've already reinstalled Sierra once ... which should have fixed the problem, but didn't.\n\nA: You're getting that message because the repair_packages command no longer exists in Sierra. Repairing permissions, which is what they're trying to get your system to do, is automatically handled during software updates now. I'm not sure what the underlying issue they're trying to fix is, but repairing permissions on system files probably is not the issue anyway, especially on a clean install.\nApple's not going to be able to help you because Sierra doesn't have that utility. You'll need to go back to WebRoot and ask them how to resolve your issue on Sierra.\n(For a company that claims to be selling internet security software, you'd think they'd be a little more versed in the OS for that software, especially before asking a user to run a command in Terminal!)\n", "Q: Sleuth Kit Autopsy won't run I am trying to install Autopsy on my macbook but I cannot get the application running.

Everything copied correctly, however, when I tried to set up Time Machine on the new MacBook Pro using the original Time Machine disk, I was unable to.  I'm not sure why, and as a result, I had to buy a new external HD for a new Time Machine backup.  This was a somewhat of a waste because the original Time Machine backup disk was less than half full.  Also, I was no longer able to access backups from before the migration, since the new MacBook Pro would not recognize the original Time Machine disk.\nNow, I'll be doing the same thing soon, and my current Time Machine disk is barely a third (1/3) full, and I'd rather not purchase a new HD, and also rather not have to lose a few years worth of backups.\nIs it possible to re-establish Time Machine for a newer machine using the same disk as for the older machine (and the source of the migration image)?\n\nA: When you get a new Mac, you can use Migration Assistant, along with your Time Machine external drive, to restore your a backup to your new computer. However, Time Machine will not backup your new computer to that external drive because it recognizes that the identifier of the internal drive on your new computer doesn't match the identifier of the internal drive on your old computer. (It's trying to prevent another disk with the same name from being backed up and causing problems with existing Time Machine backups.)\nYou have two options to get around this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can format the Time Machine drive after you restore, and then set it as the Time Machine destination as normal. Of course, this means all of your backups from the past are gone.\n\n*You can associate your new internal drive with Time Machine, thereby allowing it to continue with backups.\nThere is a chance that something goes wrong in the association process and you lose all of your previous backups. But it should work, and certainly formatting the disk will result in no chance of you having access to your previous backups.\nTo associate your new computer's drive with your Time Machine drive, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that you have restored your backup onto your new computer and everything seems present and accounted for. Again, you should come out of this with all of your backups, but you want to be sure everything's already on the internal drive, just in case.\n\n*Find out where your backups are. Go to the Time Machine external drive in Finder and double-click on Backups.backupdb. Double-click on the folder with the name of your computer, which should be the only folder present. Scroll to the bottom until you find Latest and double-click on that. At this point you should see a folder with your hard drive's name, and double-click on it.\n\n*In the View menu, select Show Path Bar. (If the only option you see about the Path Bar says Hide Path Bar, ignore the last sentence) At the bottom of the Finder window you should see something like this:\n\nAt the far left is your Time Machine disk's name, followed by the .backupdb folder name, followed by your computer's name, followed by the date-time of the last backup, followed by your internal hard drive's name.\nKeep the Finder window open.\n\n*Note that you'll need to replace several bits in the following command with your computer's information. It's important that you do not add or remove spaces or change anything other than the bits indicated.\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/Volumes/New Internal Hard Drive Name\" \"/Volumes/Time Machine Disk Name/Backups.backupdb/Computer Name/Latest/Old Internal Hard Drive Name\"\n\nIn the above command, this is what needs to be adjusted. Here's the image of mine again for you to follow along with:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*New Internal Hard Drive Name: This is the name of your new computer's internal hard drive. If you haven't changed it, it will be Macintosh HD by default. (This is not in the little image above, but if you haven't moved it, it's the name on the drive icon in the upper-right corner of your desktop on your new computer.)\n\n*Time Machine Disk Name: This is the name of the external drive that you use for Time Machine. It's whatever shows up in Finder when you go to view your Time Machine drive, including spaces. (This is Baracuda in the image above.)\n\n*Computer Name: This is the name of your old computer. If not changed from the default, it will be something like Joe's MacBook Pro. (This is KevG5 in the image above.)\n\n*Old Internal Hard Drive Name: This is the name of your old internal hard drive. (This is Ted in the image above.)\n\n\nAdjusted for my computer, this is what it would look like:\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/Volumes/Bill\" \"/Volumes/Baracuda/Backups.backupdb/KevG5/Latest/Ted\"\n\nAgain, you must adjust it with your own computer's information. If you have questions, please use the comment feature below this answer.\n\n*Now, open Terminal (in the Applications > Utilities folder), copy and paste your adjusted command, and press Return/Enter. You will be asked for your computer login password. When you type it, the characters will not appear - that's to be expected. After you type your password, press Return/Enter again.\nAfter all of this is done, you should be able to use your existing Time Machine drive with your new computer and pick up with backups as if nothing else changed.\n\nA: Hi I had to do a couple of things to do before being able to see my previous archives on my new Mac's Time Machine.\nFor history here is what I did :\nRun the sudo tmutil associatedisk -a on terminal \nHad the following error:\n\nFailed to gather snapshots for xxx\n\nIt was a problem of terminal permissions !\nSo I did this:\n\nI went into System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy and\n  added Terminal to the Full Disk Access panel.

A dialog message popped up asking if I wanted this computer to inherit the Time Machine backup from my previous computer. It cautioned that if I wanted to do this I could no longer use the backup on the previous computer. Fine with me. My previous backup is now associated with the new computer with no problems.\nApple support doc outlining when and where you can inherit a Time Machine disk: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25698?locale=en_US\n\nA: As of Monterey, Terminal commands are no longer needed:\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences -> Time Machine\n\n*Select the disk containing the backups from your old Mac (it will have an orange i next to it)\n\n*In the dialogue, click \"Claim existing Backups\" (or similar, i am on a non-english system)\n\n", "Q: SSD drive to USB connection I have a spare SSD Drive that's been removed from my iMac.

You can get them from eBay, Amazon, etc. Purely as an example, here is a link to one on macsales.com.\nNOTE: The one in the example is for Mac SSDs used from June 2013.

He started high school this year and we just left it all as it was until he got his first iPhone recently. \n\n\n*\n\n*I changed his email address for iCloud via my laptop when I set up his phone but now we can't change it on his iPad. \n\n*We are stuck with the old email address. \n\n\nI tried everything and I no longer have the credit card for verification and even though I remember my 'numbers' \n\n\n*\n\n*I do not remember the cvv for the closed card. \n\n*We can't confirm the code that is sent to his school email address as he is no longer in primary school and they deleted his email account. \n\n\nHe doesn't want to lose all his photos, apps and game scores etc that we have backed up via iCloud and if I sign him out of iCloud on his iPad I am worried that will happen - even though I have changed his email via Apple when setting up his iphone. \nI worry that everything will be lost on his iPad if I sign him out as we are on iOS 10.0.2. \nI have read many questions and answers similar which say that iCloud should not want verification via the old email address - but it does. We also can't remember the old security questions and answers and cannot find where I wrote them all down! I cannot turn off find my iPad due to apple not recognising the old password that we know is correct for the old email associated with his account on his iPad. I am stuck and have tried everything..... \nHave we missed any obvious steps to recover this account?\n\nA: Before you do anything, make a backup of the iPad to a computer if you can.\nAlso, convincing a school or company to reinstate an email for long enough to recover an account is often doable with patience and some cookies or a pie to the person that’s inconvenienced or needs to approve such a request. \nThat being said, In my experience @books453 is right and iOS asks what you want to do with photos and other iCloud data when you sign out: so you should be able to remove them from the device or leave them there as long as you aren’t wiping the device. \nSince they remain on a device you control, you are able to add to a new iCloud account when you sign in with it. However, I don't know whether this applies to data stored in apps and games, such as game scores.\nWhen you say I changed his email address for iCloud via my laptop when I set up his phone, it sounds like you actually created a new iCloud account for him. If you had in fact changed the email address associated with his iCloud account then I don't think Apple would still be sending confirmation emails to the old email address, as you say many other people have already told you (sorry to repeat it!). To verify whether the new email address is attached to his old iCloud account, log in to http://icloud.com/ with the new email address and see whether the photos and other data from the iPad are are available there - if they are, I would be confident that the replacement of the email address has worked and therefore it should be safe to sign out of the old address and sign in to the new address.\nIf this was my device and data, I would make an appointment with the Genius Bar at a time when the Apple store won't be busy and ask them to walk through the process with me. Your son's new iPhone should entitle him to at least one session of personal setup assistance and technical support. And don't accept what the first Genius tells you if it's not what you want - get a second opinion, as this is a tricky case that not all staff may be familiar with.\nEDIT:\nSorry, I missed that in your question you mentioned you can't even sign out of Find my iPad, which is preventing you from signing out of iCloud even if you want to. I assume that when you tried to go through the process of signing out of iCloud, you eventually hit this prompt:\n\nAnd based on the confirmation email I received after turning off Find my iPad, you may not even be able to restore or reactivate your iPad unless you can turn off Find my iPad first, which you can't because Apple isn't accepting the password for the old email address:\n\nPresumably this is part of Apple's anti-theft measures that try to make stolen iPhones and iPads useless.\nIs there any chance you can visit an Apple Store? If not, I have found their on-line chat people to be very helpful. Does your iPad show up as a registered device under your son's new iCloud email address at https://supportprofile.apple.com/ ? If so, I would hope that Apple's support team would at least try to help you.\n\nA: If you sign out of iCloud, the data stored on the device will still be there, and if it does want to delete something, it will ask you. You can always try backing up your ipad to iTunes to ensure there is no data loss. If none of this works, I recommend you contact apple support.\n", "Q: AppleScript detect key press by user alternatives I have searched and found that AppleScript is unable to detect key presses by the user.

Why does macOS install not allow you to set matching passwords?\n(It is however possible to enter a different password at first and later change it to match the iCloud account, so it appears there is no technical obstacle to using matching passwords.) \nPlease note: I'm not interested in comments about using the same password being a good practice or not. I'm interested in knowing why the macOS installer enforces different passwords in this specific case.\n\nA: Absent any explicit statement from Apple, it's as good as it gets: The reason it enforces different passwords is because it's a good security practice.\nThe fact you are able to change it later shows that they haven't implemented cross-checking in the later stage but it also shows there are no technical reasons why it has to be the way it is.\n\nA: I think it has something to do with the fact that if you change your email address on your iCloud account it messes up the login process (and for MacBooks the Drive Vault authentication, making the device inaccessible)\n", "Q: Windows 10 Bootcamp throws exception on first boot with igdkmd64.sys driver I've spent the better part of a week trying to get Bootcamp setup with Windows 10 on my Mac and have finally ended up in a spot that I've not been able to get around on my own.\nI have installed Windows 10 via Bootcamp, and during the initial Windows boot-up during the installation, I'm given the following BSOD\n\nI've googled like crazy and have come to the conclusion that this appears to be related to the Intel drivers.

Seems lame to have to Google it, and then find nothing.\nAlso, assuming it's possible, can this be done without using the mouse?\n\nA: Voice Memos are synced through iTunes.\nFirst you have to turn on music syncing. You don't have to actually sync any music, but that's where the option for Voice Memos is.\nWhen your device is plugged in, click on its icon in iTunes then click on Music on the left-hand sidebar. Check the box next to Sync Music, then ensure Include Voice Memos is also checked.\nIf you don't want to actually put any music on the device, click the \"Selected playlists ...\" radio button and then don't check anything in the Playlists, Genres, Artists or Albums areas.\nClick on Apply (or Sync) toward the bottom right. Your voice memos will transfer to your computer.\nOnce on your computer, they'll be in your iTunes Media folder (usually at ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media) under Voice Memos. Copy them from that location into a safe place.\nThen go back into iTunes, select all on the automatically-created Voice Memos playlist (under Music), and press and hold Option while you right-click and choose Delete.

Turned it off looks like a bad idea. The second problem was target volumes list items doesn't have actions. Which make impossible to click on them via click or \"click at\" functions perhaps because of some new additional protections on Big Sur. Click with AST and other scripts also doesn't works due to new MacOS restrictions. The only way I found is using python click(but this leads to a slight delay while script selects target volume).\nSo here is a fully automated switching:\nproperty targetVolume : \"BOOTCAMP\" # find name of required volume inside System Preference > Startup Disk\nproperty passwordValue : \"yourSystemPassword\" # Can be empty\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application \"System Preferences\"\n        set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.startupdisk\"\n        activate\n    end tell\n    tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n        tell window \"Startup Disk\"\n            set volumePosition to {0, 0}\n            set lockFound to false\n            \n            # Check if auth required\n            set authButtonText to \"Click the lock to make changes.\"\n            if exists button authButtonText then\n                click button authButtonText\n                \n                # Wait for auth modal\n                set unlockButtonText to \"Unlock\"\n                repeat\n                    if (exists sheet 1) and (exists button unlockButtonText of sheet 1) then exit repeat\n                end repeat\n                \n                # Autofill password if setted\n                if passwordValue is not equal to \"\" then\n                    set value of text field 1 of sheet 1 to passwordValue\n                    click button unlockButtonText of sheet 1\n                end if\n                \n                # Wait for auth success\n                repeat\n                    if exists button \"Click the lock to prevent further changes.\" then exit repeat\n                end repeat\n            end if\n            \n            # Wait until loading volumes list\n            repeat\n                if exists group 1 of list 1 of scroll area 1 then exit repeat\n            end repeat\n            \n            # Click on target volume (posible a slight delay because of shell script executing)\n            repeat with m in (UI element of list 1 of scroll area 1)\n                if (value of first static text of m = targetVolume) then\n                    tell static text targetVolume of m\n                        set volumePosition to position\n                    end tell\n                end if\n            end repeat\n            set volumePositionX to item 1 of volumePosition\n            set volumePositionY to item 2 of volumePosition\n            my customClick(volumePositionX, volumePositionY)\n            \n            click button \"Restart…\"\n            \n            # Wait for restart modal appears\n            repeat\n                if (exists sheet 1) and (exists value of first static text of sheet 1) then exit repeat\n            end repeat\n            \n            click button \"Restart\" of sheet 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n# shell script to make click work on target volume\non customClick(x, y)\n    do shell script \" \n\n/usr/bin/python <<END\n\nimport sys\n\nimport time\n\nfrom Quartz.CoreGraphics import * \n\ndef mouseEvent(type, posx, posy):\n\n          theEvent = CGEventCreateMouseEvent(None, type, (posx,posy), kCGMouseButtonLeft)\n\n          CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, theEvent)\n\ndef mousemove(posx,posy):\n\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventMouseMoved, posx,posy);\n\ndef mouseclick(posx,posy):\n\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseDown, posx,posy);\n\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseUp, posx,posy);\n\nourEvent = CGEventCreate(None); \n\ncurrentpos=CGEventGetLocation(ourEvent);             # Save current mouse position\n\nmouseclick(\" & x & \",\" & y & \");\n\nmousemove(int(currentpos.x),int(currentpos.y));      # Restore mouse position\n\nEND\"\nend customClick\n\non simpleEncryption(_str)\n    set x to id of _str\n    repeat with c in x\n        set contents of c to c + 100\n    end repeat\n    return string id x\nend simpleEncryption\n\non simpleDecryption(_str)\n    set x to id of _str\n    repeat with c in x\n        set contents of c to c - 100\n    end repeat\n    return string id x\nend simpleDecryption\n\nYou just need to change two properties targetVolume and passwordValue.

I'm trying to test my mac app under OSX El Capitan 10.11 and OSX Yosemite 10.10 , and am currently running macos Sierra 10.12. So far I've tried searching under the app store but none of the older version appear when searching. Also have tried checking the apple developer downloads section https://developer.apple.com/download/ , as well as the 'more downloads' section there. \nAre there any options besides attempting to download a torrent of the older OS?\n\nA: If you've been using a mac long enough to have the desired older osx/macos versions installed under your apple id / itunes account, you can find these downloads by opening up the app store, then option-clicking the purchased tab. See picture below:\n\nAnswer found via Paul Goracke (@pgor)\n", "Q: How does the Apple Watch <-> macOS Sierra unlock feature work in detail? Does anyone know how the Apple Watch unlock feature work in macOS Sierra?\nI figured out, that I have to be very near my Mac, that the feature works.\nDoes it use Bluetooth (BLE) or WIFI?\nIt would be really nice to get some details about this nice feature.\n\nA: It uses both Bluetooth LE 4.0 AND 802.11ac WiFi.\nBluetooth is used to discover the Apple Watch and establish a connection.\nThen it uses WiFi to do \"time-in-flight\" calculations - i.e. to figure out how far your watch is from the Mac. The Mac needs to support 802.11ac WiFi for this to work. All watches are supported, both the old and the new - even though the old ones does not support 802.11ac.\nThis way it is possible to prevent attacks such as someone planting a \"bluetooth repeater\" near you, so that it could replay your bluetooth responses captured this way to a Mac located somewhere remotely.\n\nA: I found a interesting article, where this feature is described in detail:\nhttps://networkingnerd.net/2016/09/21/apple-watch-unlock-802-11ac-and-time/\n\nA: It uses both Bluetooth and WIFI.\nBluetooth determines the distance between your Mac and AppleWatch , WIFI checks if your connected to the same network to 'grant you access'. \nThink of Bluetooth Beacons, they only work if your near ~ cm from a beacon. You can setup beacons to show up on your device if your close enough. The Mac works like a beacon this way.\n", "Q: Mission Control not working after system upgrade to macOS Sierra Today I had changed my MacBook Pro early 2011 hard drive for a SSD, and did a clean installation of macOS Sierra. Everything is working like a charm, except for the Mission Control, when I try to execute it via Trackpad shortcut or App in the Launchpad, it restarts me the Dock. That is an unexpected issue, and I'm want to know if someone encountered this bug before!\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a Mac Book Pro (late 2011). I did a clean installation of macOS Sierra and Mission Control and Launchpad were not working, but it did not restart the Dock when I tried to open any of them. I researched a bit I tried killall Dock on the Terminal, for restarting it manually and that worked for me.\nGive it a try. Maybe doing it manually will make it work.\n\nA: You can use a system \"tweaking\" utility such as OnyX.\nThe workflow is:\nParameters > Applications > Mission Control > Turn on Mission Control [checkbox]\nIt'll give you a warning that OnyX must reopen the Dock for this change to take effect.\"\nHit Continue and let it do it's business and... done. Functionality = instantly restored. Typing this takes 10x longer than actually doing it btw so no worries there. Painless. (But of course not entirely pain-free as you actually have to expend kilojoules and a couple seconds fixing something that shouldn't be broken in the first place but hey, working solution until base bug fixed. ; )\nP.S.

Over the last day though, I've been downloading a bunch of podcasts that fail to download, but take up space. For example, I had ~400MB and tried to download a ~100MB podcast.

However, since the Sierra upgrade, the thumbnails for many of my photos are showing as missing:\n\nMost of the photos do not show properly when double-clicked, but going back and forth between the photo display and the photo editing tools seems to sometimes get them back.\nThis seems to happen indiscriminately with iPhone photos and Canon RAW photos. In addition, some thumbnails are purely associated with the wrong photos:\n\nHow can I make my thumbnails come back? Is there any risk of losing the photos themselves?\n\nA: Try repairing your Photos library. You can do this by holding down the keys Command + Option when launching Photos.app.\n\n\nA: This may be a possible solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Photos App\n\n*Click on Photos (in sidebar on the left)\n\n*Select one thumbnail and then press Command+a, in order to select all photos at once\n\n*After having selected all photos, right click, and click on Rotate.\n\n*This will take a while depending on the amount of photos you have.\n\n*After it has rotated all the photos, select all the photos again, and click on Rotate anti-clockwise, (to get the thumbnails rotated back to normal)\n\n*This should solve your issue!! i.e. this is a workaround to rebuilt your thumbnails.\n\n\nNote\nDo not use cleanup software such as CleanMyMac, especially not for Photos at least.

I HOPE this time i am more specific.\ni am looking for your answers. \nrespect\n\nA: No such quality difference has been disclosed by Apple, nor do I know of anyone outside Apple discussing such a quality difference.\n\nA: iPhones that are purchased in Dubai dont have facetime, because you bought the phone in a country where facetime is restricted. However this quora thread suggest you can always re-enable FaceTime, I am not sure though.This apple.stackexchange.com question however seems to be contradictory. \n\nA: There are difference between iPhone's between countries.

Soon after upgrading I started to notice a intermittent issue where the phone would randomly jump to a black screen with a white loading spinner in the middle (similar to what you see when shutting the phone down) and then after about 5 seconds it will take me back to the lock screen.  I'm still able to unlock the phone using the fingerprint reader (so the phone hasn't actually rebooted) and the phone appears to function as per normal.  \nIt is extremely annoying as it can happen in the middle of any phone function (including taking and making calls) and on some days can happen more than half a dozen times.  \nSo far I have noticed it happening when using the following Apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Chrome \n\n*Microsoft Outlook App \n\n*Facebook App \n\n*Apple Music App (completely stopped a playing track at the time)\n\n\nNot sure if it's just random or being triggered by particular apps.  When it happens whilst Google Chrome is open the next time I open Chrome it reports that Chrome crashed and \"would I like to restore my pages?\".\nI haven't done a fresh iOS 10 install but I'm reluctant to do this as it takes time and risks my data and setup on the phone now (even though I do have a iCloud backup).\nI have also since upgraded to iOS 10.0.2 (14A456) but the problem still remains.  \nIs there a way to view diagnostic, error or event logs on the OS to see what might be happening immediately before the black screen occurs?\nAnyone else experiencing the issue?\n\nA: My recommendation is to do a restore to factory settings and then dont restore the backup and see if the issue persists. I read the comments and saw that you had the device replaced and that the issue persisted once you restored the backup. Apparently there is some app data that is corrupt in your backup that is causing the issue. I urge to just set up the iPhone as new, and then dont restore the backup. If you need those apps back, all you have to do is login to both iCloud and iTunes & App Stores in settings (iOS 11 click on your name above). Next go into the App Store app and then look for updates, and then click on your profile icon (iOS 11) and then look for purchased apps (or purchased). In both lists are your recently purchased/downloaded apps. If you used another account then those apps may be on that other account.\n", "Q: 90 degree down angled USB connector for iphone 4s Anyone know of supplier of such a cable?  I have very restricted space at rear of car headunit to fit the USB connector - hence I need a down angled USB plug with a 30 pin connectoe at other end.   Apple doe not seem to manufacture them.  I want to buy one that is supported by Apple- ie they cannot \"disable\" it because the manufacturer is not licenced.\n\nA: Have you considered a 90 degree USB adapter instead of a specialized dock/30-pin cable?  I'm using this right angle adapter with my Alpine head unit and a 10' lightning cable and have no issues with my iPhone 6 or 7 plus.  \nRight angle USB 3.0 adapter\nIf you absolutely need it to come out of the head unit and straight down then you should be able to use one of these with similar results.\nL Shape USB 3.0 adapter\nThe \"accessory not supported\" messages usually are a result of an aftermarket cable that isn't manufactured within the guidelines of the Apple MFi program.  This pertains more to the lightning or dock connector end rather than the USB connection end of the cable.  Because of that you should be able to use just about any USB adapter to meet your needs.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Get Color Sidebar Icons Back in Mac OS finder Window Suppose I want to come back to Color sidebar icon for Finder.

I bought new touchscreen&glass and it works. However I entered few invalid passcodes and now my iPhone 4S says \"iPhone is disabled. Connect to iTunes\". Its running on iOS 8.4 jailbroken and if I restore it to 9.3.5 i wont be able to use it anymore ... as there is no jailbrake for it.

Is there any way to try at least one more passcode that I believe should be the correct one or what basically i can so now ?\n\nA: Per Apple:\n\nIf you enter the wrong passcode in to an iOS device six times in a row, you'll be locked out and a message will say that your device is disabled.\nUnless you made a backup before you forgot your passcode, there isn't a way to save your device's data.

Would editing those photos in the Photos app on a 2013 (non-Retina) iMac result in loss of quality?\n\nA: From doing my own testing, it does appear to be the case. I edited a photo on my iPhone 7+ to soften some highlights. When viewed on my iMac, the highlights were still blown out. I further lowered the highlights on my iMac. Now the photo viewed on my iPhone had blown out highlights once again. Trying to edit it on my iPhone showed all the color controls at 0, even though it was clear it had been edited.\n", "Q: iTunes 12.5 - Add photo of artist / edit rainbow microphone thumbnail In the \"Artist\" view of iTunes 12.5, is it possible to make a photo of the artist (or at least one of the album covers) appear in place of the rainbow microphone?\n\nUpdate (2017)\nIt appears that with 12.5.5.5 (possibly earlier, but I didn't notice), Artists that are known to Apple now have their photos set correctly:\n\nThere still doesn't appear to be a way to manually set or override this image though.\n\nA: I don't have a solution, but I believe I've discovered the root cause of the issue.\nIn the iTunes store, each artist has a biography page. Some artists have a band image, others do not. For every artist in my library that has an image, it is the same image on their iTunes bio. For every microphone, the artists bio is text only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: It's true that the Artist picture (when iTunes actually posts it) comes from the artist's bio, but that doesn't mean it will show up.  Take a look at these two photos.  The one on the left side shows the microphone where Alice Cooper's photo should be.  The one on the right shows Alice Cooper's bio page where there IS a photo in place.\nIt would be easier to look the other way if there was consistency.   I'd just chalk it up as being a work in progress.  That's just not the case.  It's a bug that Apple has just ignored since the release of 12.5.\n\n\nA: No, missing artist images do not depend on the source of the music. Even if you bought it from Apple, you may get the ugly microphone images!\n\nA: I found something interesting.  While iTunes and iOS iphone have lots of microphones for my artists, I recently downloaded Apple Music for my Android Note 9.  In that version, the vast majority of my artists show either a photo or it shows the album cover from one of the albums (something it used to show as a default prior to 12.5).  Why would Apple Music on Android show something not even seen in iTunes or iOS?!?\nSee below, iTunes, iOS and then Android Apple Music\n\n\n\n", "Q: Amending/deleting Notes or Calendar entries on iPad or in iCloud I am unfamiliar with iCloud and generally a bit dim. If I amend or delete a note or Calendar entry on my iPad will that change affect the note or Calendar entry in iCloud, and vice versa?\nIf so, is there a way to delete/amend notes on the iPad but preserving the original in the iCloud?\n\nA: If you are signed into iCloud on your iPad, generally changes you make to iCloud-synced items will sync to your other devices through iCloud.\nParticularly for Notes, you can have device-specific notes by doing the following on your iPad:\nGo to Settings > Notes and go to the bottom where you should see an \"On My iPad\" Account option. Toggle that on and you will then have a place in Notes to store notes that stay just on your iPad. This will appear in the list of folders under \"ON MY IPAD\" and you can create new folders under that section, just as you would for iCloud.\nFor Calendars, there is no way to maintain a local-only calendar and still sync another calendar to iCloud. (You can do this if you use something other than iCloud to sync your calendar, such as Gmail, but not with iCloud.)\n", "Q: Apps not working properly in background I have an iPhone 5C with iOS 10, and I have several apps that are supposed to do things in the background - specifically I'm thinking of Google Photos, IFTTT, and Android Wear, although there are might be more that I haven't noticed yet - like FB Messenger, Allo, Duo, Skype, Life360, Hiya, etc...\nFor example, Google Photos is supposed to auto-backup my camera photos, IFTTT is supposed to perform actions on all newly created reminders and screenshots, and Android Wear is supposed to connect to my LG watch.\nOn my old Android phone, they just did their thing whether the app was running or not. On iPhone, apparently you have to open the apps, and just leave them running in the background for them to behave.\nHowever, for each of the three I've listed, they seem to only work as expected for a limited time (no idea how much time), before they just stop working. For example, I'll add a reminder, take a photo, or take a screenshot, and the actions don't happen, even though IFTTT and Google Photos show that they are running if I flip through the open apps.\nI select the IFTTT or Google Photos app the following day from the open apps list, and immediately the actions kick off. Same for my watch - it'll work for half a day or so, then suddenly refuses to connect until I switch to the Android Wear app on the phone, then it immediately connects.\nBackground App Refresh is enabled on all of these apps.\nThis question seems to indicate that these apps should work. If they weren't popular apps, I'd blame the apps themselves, but I doubt Google and IFTTT would leave this big a hole in their products.\nIs there another setting I need to look at? Is there maybe some CPU or memory limitation that is blocking these apps that will be resolved with a newer more powerful phone?\n\nA: Apps shown as \"open\" but that are not the foreground app are in the Suspended state (described below), with a couple of exceptions. So the apps you are seeing in the app switcher are generally not actively doing anything.\nOn a general level, these are the states an app can be in on iOS.\n\nNot running: The app has not been launched or was running but was terminated by the system.\nInactive: The app is running in the foreground but is currently not receiving events. (It may be executing other code though.) An app usually stays in this state only briefly as it transitions to a different state.\nActive: The app is running in the foreground and is receiving events. This is the normal mode for foreground apps.\nBackground: The app is in the background and executing code. Most apps enter this state briefly on their way to being suspended. However, an app that requests extra execution time may remain in this state for a period of time. In addition, an app being launched directly into the background enters this state instead of the inactive state. For information about how to execute code while in the background, see Background Execution.\nSuspended: The app is in the background but is not executing code. The system moves apps to this state automatically and does not notify them before doing so. While suspended, an app remains in memory but does not execute any code. When a low-memory condition occurs, the system may purge suspended apps without notice to make more space for the foreground app.\n\nBackground Execution is possible, as noted above, but only for specific use cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps that play audible content to the user while in the background, such as a music player app\n\n*Apps that record audio content while in the background\n\n*Apps that keep users informed of their location at all times, such as a navigation app\n\n*Apps that support Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\n\n*Apps that need to download and process new content regularly\n\n*Apps that receive regular updates from external accessories\n\n\nThere is one other case, which is downloading in the background. This is a special case, though, because the app itself is still suspended and the download process is handed off to the system, in case the app has to be terminated by the system to reclaim resources.\nSpecifically with Google Photos, the app would need to be in the Active state, meaning phone unlocked and in the foreground, to find any photos that need to be uploaded. (After it has a list of them, it may be able to pass the actual uploads to the system for Background Execution, but I don't know if that's how it actually operates.)\nFor IFTTT, it likely has to be in the foreground to execute recipes that rely on iOS-specific things (i.e. Reminders). It might qualify for background execution under \"Apps that keep users informed of their location at all times,\" but maybe not (even though it does have location-based triggers).\nThe Android Wear app should qualify under \"Apps that receive regular updates\" for background execution. Since it's working some of the time, it seems to be set up to do that. In the case of that app, I would guess it's being terminated by the system to reclaim resources.\nA newer device with more resources would definitely not hurt the situation (especially for Android Wear, I bet), but some of this is just down to the way iOS operates in order to conserve system resources (and consequently, battery life).\n", "Q: Error 105, press F5 on Safari using Sierra Since update to macOS Sierra I have permanent error while trying to watch movie on the ewebsite:\n\nDo you know how to solve this?\n\nA: All you need to do is change your wifi setting.

I updated to iOS 10 and noticed that when I open the notification center (swipe top-down) it always starts on the right card, which I suppose is recent notifications.\nIt used to start on what's now the left card, which is more of a widget dashboard screen. How can I make it always start on the left card?\n\nA: As far as I recall that's how iOS 9 (and 8, I think) operated, too.\nIn any event there is no setting to change this behavior.\n", "Q: adding a exception rule to do not disturb?

(Edit a contact, tap on Ringtone or Text tone, then enable Emergency Bypass at the top of the screen. You have to do this for each of calls [ringtone] and texts [text tone] if you want both to get through.)\nYou cannot add exceptions for any other kind of notifications or activities.\n", "Q: RBENV managed Rubies: VIM upgrade forcing homebrew to install Ruby I've recently switched from RVM to RBENV as my Ruby manager under MacOS Sierra.\n$ rbenv version\n2.3.1 (set by /Users/meltemi/.rbenv/version)\n$ which ruby\n/Users/meltemi/.rbenv/shims/ruby\n\nI've used Homebrew to install packages like vim for years and never had Ruby version be installed via Homebrew.\nNow when I brew upgrade vim I get a forced dependency install of Ruby.\n==> Upgrading vim\n==> Installing dependencies for vim: ruby\n==> Installing vim dependency: ruby\n==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/ruby-2.3.1_2.sierra.bottle.tar.gz\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Pouring ruby-2.3.1_2.sierra.bottle.tar.gz\nError: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully\nThe formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local\nCould not symlink bin/rake\nTarget /usr/local/bin/rake\nalready exists.

It's installing a ruby because rbenv likely isn't returning an installed ruby when the ruby shim is called by the build package.\nGiven vim will dynamically link to your Ruby installation, I highly recommend you just switch to system ruby before you brew install or upgrade vim. Something like:\nbrew uninstall vim ruby\nbrew cleanup\nrbenv global system\nbrew install --build-from-source vim --with-custom-ruby\n\nThe installer will happily use system ruby on the Mac, which has a high enough version, during installation and the resulting binaries created won't segfault if you happen to remove the specific ruby version they were built against, which is a real problem if you use a rbenv-controlled ruby at build time.\nAlternatively you can build without ruby support:\nbrew install vim --without-ruby\n\nBut that's probably not what you want.\n", "Q: Sending messages to an iPhone without iMessage I need to send texts to my kids while they are away from Wi-Fi. I pay for a text message service through my carrier, but can't force my phone to send a text message instead of an iMessage with iOS 10.\nSo are all our iPhones incapable of sending text messages to people without data plans now?\n\nA: On all of your iPhones go to Settings > Messages. \nYou will see an option to Send as SMS.

I have a lot of photos with me that I want to rename. I want them to be 10 random characters. Is there a way to do it?\nI am running macOS Sierra.\nI didn't try anything yet.\nI would prefer a free solution to this problem.  \n\nA: The following script assumes that the photos to be renamed are in your Pictures folder. This will rename every file in your Pictures folder to a 10 character random string of letters and numbers while keeping the file extensions intact.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nchars=({a..z} {A..Z} {0..9})\n\nfunction random_string {\n  local count=$1\n  local output=\n  while ((count--)); do\n    output+=${chars[$((RANDOM % ${#chars[@]}))]}\n  done\n  printf '%s\\n' \"$output\"\n}\n\nfor file in ~/Pictures/*; do\n  ext=$(echo ${file} | sed 's,^.*\\(\\.[^\\.]*$\\),\\1,')\n  mv \"$file\" ~/Pictures/\"$(random_string 10)\"${ext}\ndone\n\nIf the files to be renamed are not in your Pictures folder then edit ~/Pictures accordingly. The ~ is simply a shortcut for the users home directory. So ~/Pictures = /Users/YourUsername/Pictures. Note that the * tells the script to match any file found in ~/Pictures. Also note that you can change the number of characters generated by changing the number 10 of (rand_string 10)to any number you like.\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste this into a plain text file and name it something like: rename_pics.sh\n\n\n*Open your Terminal (use spotlight to find it if you don't know it's location)\n\n\n*In your Terminal type chmod 755 rename_pics.sh and press Enter\n\n\n*Then type ./rename_pics.sh in your terminal and press Enter to run the script.\n\nA: Copy and paste this into a text file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd \"$1\"\nfor i in ./*; do\n    mv \"$i\" $((RANDOM * 32768 + RANDOM))\ndone\n\nRun the following command to make the file executable (assuming you've saved the file as randomlyrename):\nchmod 755 randomlyrename\n\nAnd run the file:\n./randomlyrename /path/to/folder/containing/things-to-rename\n\nBear in mind that it'll rename everything in the directory it's provided to a string of random numbers ten digits long.\n", "Q: Which countries can receive payments from Apple?

It's extremely important, I can't afford to buy a new computer. So maybe like 3 or 4 weeks ago I got a virus. We got rid of the virus, but the computer was sill INCREDIBLY slow. It got so extreme I had to wipe the drive and install a fresh copy of macOS Sierra. This still did not make it faster. It sure helped, but it didn't fix it. I have to do frequent restarts to get mild preformance for like 10 minutes. As of time of writing, it's being very slow. I'm barely able to type.\nSo I asked on StackExchange, but I didn't pose my question correct I guess, so at the end, the answer was, I do not need more RAM.

Thanks :)!\n\n\nA: I remember your other questions, so will try and help you get to the bottom of this. You need to understand though, that troubleshooting is a process of elimination and, as a result, can take some time.\nBefore we start, I am going to ignore that you had a virus a few weeks ago, because that could be confusing things. In other words, we need to start afresh because the virus and this issue may be totally unrelated.\nI can see from the various images you posted that you do have plenty of free hard drive space, so that's one possible cause we can eliminate. So, one by one, let's try and resolve this.\n1. Let's start your computer in Safe Mode\nOur first test will be to see what happens when you start your iMac in Safe Mode. Doing this forces your iMac to perform some tests and also prevents some software from automatically loading or opening. \nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your iMac\n\n*As soon as you hear the startup sound, press and hold the Shift key\n\n*Once you see the Apple logo, let go of the Shift key\n\n\nDon't be concerned if your iMac takes longer to boot up (remember it's performing some tests). After it's booted, use it for a while. Do this for long enough for you to be satisfied that the problem still persists (or not). Once you're done, restart the computer normally to exit Safe Mode. \nNote: While in Safe mode you won't be able to do everything you normally can, and your macOS environment may appear/work differently. Do not worry about this.\nWhen ready, report back on how you went.\n2. Create and log in to a new user account\nOur next test is to create a totally new user account and check whether logging in to this has any impact on performance. In case you don't know how to do this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple Menu > System Preferences\n\n*Select Users and Groups\n\n*Click on the + sign at bottom left to add a new user (you may need to unlock the padlock below that to make changes)\n\n*Set your user options and ensure that automatic login is off\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\nNow restart your computer and log in to the newly created user account. Once logged in, do not install any new software etc. Instead, just use the computer for a while to determine if it is still slow.\nWhen ready, report back on how you went.\n3. Install macOS Sierra on an external drive\nOur next test is to take advantage of your external hard drive to try and determine whether we have an issue between macOS Sierra and your computer. If not, it may indicate either a problem with your internal hard drive or 3rd party software.\nUse this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a full installation of macOS Sierra on the external hard drive but do not install any 3rd party software.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n*Immediately press and hold the Option key. \n\n*The Startup Manager will appear and shouldn't take too long to list your internal hard drive and the external drive.\n\n*Use your mouse or the left/right arrow keys to select the external hard drive you just installed macOS Sierra on\n\n*Double-click or press the Return key to start your iMac from the external hard drive\n\n\nNow use your iMac from the external drive for a while doing a few things to get a sense of how well it's responding. Please only use default Apple apps (such as Safari etc) for now.\nWhen ready, report back on how you went.\n", "Q: iPhone iOS 10 compatible with Mac OS X 10.7.5? After upgrading my iPhone 6 to iOS 10, iTunes and iPhoto on my computer (mac OS X version 10.7.5) will no longer sync with the phone - any solutions around this? My mac is not capable of  moving to newer operating system.\n\nA: iOS 10 requires iTunes 12.5.1 if you're on a Mac. However, the last version of iTunes to support macOS X Lion is 12.2.2.25, so I'm guessing that's your problem.\nIf you still need to be able to transfer media such as photos and music between your Mac and your iPhone 6, you can opt to use third party software. One example is iExplorer which happens to still support OS X 10.7 and iTunes 10.\nAnother possibility, depending on your actual model of Mac, is to install newer versions of macOS via alternative methods. If you want to pursue this, please post another question providing full details of your Mac hardware (including model, RAM, etc).\n", "Q: How can I temporarily turn off the Apple watch display? The display on the Apple Watch tends to turn on and off too often.  This is distracting especially in darker environments.  \nThis rapid turn on -then- turn off of the display that occurs when \n\n\n*\n\n*\"talking with one's hands\" \n\n*general household chores (emptying the dishwasher) \n\n*moving around in a theatre (eating/drinking) \n\n\nThis is distracting to the listener or the speaker (wearer of the watch).\nYes, I can immediately dim the watch by covering it, but any accelerometer  motion will reactivate the display.  \nPreferred experience\nIdeally I would like to cover the watch and have it go dark for either a custom time period, or until the screen is tapped.\nDocumentation or control over the actions that cause the display to light would be beneficial  \n\nA: I think Apple's new Theater mode is what you are looking for. It's now available as of WatchOS 3.2.\n\nA: There is no great solution to this but what you can do is disable the \"Wake Screen on Wrist Raise\". This way you will have to tap the screen to light it up.\nYou can find the option under General > Wake Screen in the Apple Watch app. \n\nA: Yes. Theater mode is the perfect option for it.\nIt silences your Apple Watch's screen, leaving the display off unless you intentionally tap the screen or press one of the watch's buttons.\nTheater Mode: On will display at the top of the screen in Control Center. On your watch face, you'll also see a theater mask in the top center of the screen to indicate that you currently have Theater Mode activated.\nFor more info refer this link.\nhttps://www.imore.com/how-to-use-theater-mode-apple-watch\n", "Q: AppleScript to change default web browser I want to be able to change the default web browser of my Mac to Google Chrome using AppleScript.

There are camera apps that simulate it, but the hardware in iPhone 5 is apparently not physically capable of going above 60 FPS.\nIt is possible on jailbroken devices to unlock this 60 FPS mode, or at least it was as of iOS 7 (a few years ago).\n", "Q: Notes missing after upgrade to iOS 10 I just upgraded my iPhone 6 to IOS 10 and half of my notes are missing. I have a few notes under the cloud, gmail, and my phone but nothing is showing up under my email (not sure if notes were ever there).\nSeems any note created or edited in the past 12 months are gone. I have already restarted the phone.\n\nA: If you didn't backup the notes with iTunes or iCloud, then they are gonna permanently. On iPhone, there are two different kinds of notes: one is synced with iCloud and the other is local notes. I am aware of this after switching to a new iPhone. I guess the missing notes were stored locally.\n\nA: Make sure that you visit www.icloud.com and verify that your notes are present there. If it isnt there then its likely that you have notes being saved to an email that you either currently have, or used to have.\nIf neither is present, check iCloud settings on your iPhone for iCloud backups and check iTunes for iOS backups and see if you have a backup that existed before you updated. If you have one, then you can restore it and then try to see if the notes come back.\n", "Q: Turn off autosave drafts in mail on OS X El Capitan and Sierra I am having a bit of an issue here with the default mail application in mac OS El Capitan.

All I did is that in \"Mailbox Behaviors\" tab I changed the location of the Drafts folder ... now instead of saving the drafts in Gmail/Drafts folder the mail application is saving them in a Local Drafts folder on my mac ... Life is much easier now ... now I don't have to see all those drafts when I open my mailbox on my smartphone. \n\n", "Q: macOS Sierra: Why can’t I bookmark to the “Bookmarks” folder anymore? After upgrading to Sierra, The option to add a webpage to the default “Bookmarks Folder” of Safari has disappeared. I’m given the option to bookmark a webpage to my Favorites folder, as well as all of my custom folders, but I no longer have the option to bookmark to “Bookmarks.” The Bookmark folder still exists, along with my previous bookmarks within it, but the option to add to it has disappeared from the UI:\n\nIn as many previous OSX’s as I can recall, “Bookmarks” existed as an option to bookmark a webpage to. Now it’s gone. I’ve added a “Bookmarks 2.0” folder in the meantime to save webpages to. \nI’ve cleared my cache & local data, tried disabling extensions, purged Safari’s Container + Saved Application State folder contents, and traversed all of Safari’s preferences to see if I’d overlooked something. Additionally, I’ve reset iCloud syncing (unchecked then rechecked System Preferences > iCloud > Safari). \nNothing has worked. What gives?!\n\nIf there’s any confusion, SE member tubedogg posted a screenshot of the default configuration I’m talking about in the comment section. Many thanks :)\n\n\n\nA: One potential workaround:\nOpen the bookmarks sidebar using the \"Sidebar\" icon in the toolbar or the \"Show Bookmarks\" menu item in the \"Bookmarks\" menu. Highlight the URL in the menu bar and drag it into the bookmarks sidebar.\n\nA: This issue may be entirely unrelated to the OS. I'm having this issue too as of today and I haven't upgraded to Sierra. So I think it's actually the latest Safari update, 10.0, which was installed on my computer this morning, that is causing this bug.\nOther people reporting the same issue, seems to be Safari 10.0 upgrade that is the issue. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7680935?start=60&tstart=0\n\nA: Oddly enough, when I right click on the + symbol in the address bar, I do have the option to add the page to my Bookmarks. Though it still isn’t appearing under the Bookmarks dropdown Menu, this is the easiest workaround I’ve found.\n\n—————\n\n\nA: It took me awhile to resolve this issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Export all your current bookmarks before doing anything.\n\n*Go to a Mac with Bookmarks Menu working correctly.\n\n*The bookmarks file is stored at ~/Library/Safari (or Command/Shift G & enter ~/Library/Safari).\n\n*Copy bookmarks.plist to flash drive, Dropbox, etc and move to your desktop.\n\n*Open ~/Library/Safari on your Mac, rename old bookmarks.plist, move it to your desktop\n\n*Move the new bookmarks.plist from desktop to Safari folder.\n\n*Close Safari if open.\n\n*Open Safari to see new bookmarks.\n\n*Remove new bookmarks in Safari and move your bookmarks into the correct place.\n\n*This may take a little finessing.\n\n\nA: To summarize:\n• The *Bookmarks menu item in the Add this page to… popup in the Add Bookmark… was removed by Apple in Safari 10.  The only way to get it back is to revert to an older version of Safari.\n• The answer given by njboot on Dec 20 '16 is a good alternative.\n", "Q: iTunes unable to see latest backup Hi I have a problem with restoring a backup on my phone right now. This is my situation:\nI recently upgraded my iPhone to iOS 10. After a while I didn't like the interface so I wanted to downgrade it to the previous OS which is 9.3.5.\nBefore I did that I backed up my files with iTunes and proceed to revert my iPhone back to iOS 9.3.5. After reverting, i tried to restore my backup but iTunes couldn't see my backup file that I did before reverting.\nOn my iTunes, it shows that I have two backups: one on iCloud in April and the other was before I reverted to iOS 9. I can find both backups in the backup folder but iTunes can only see the one in April.\nPlease help me with the problem. I have tried various solution but it did not work.\n\nA: The backup from April is visible because it was made with iOS v9.x. The backup from before you downgraded was made with v10.x.\nYou cannot downgrade and then restore a backup from before you downgraded. It is not compatible with the version of iOS that you are running.\n", "Q: How to detect external VGA display on retina MBP running Sierra? I have a 15in Macbook Pro (Late 2013 model) which, until recently, had no problem detecting a VGA projector connected via an adaptor connected to either of the Thunderbolt ports. Today I tried it and it simply could not detect the projector display. The only difference I can think of is that I've upgraded to macOS Sierra since last I remember using this system.\nI've tried some other combinations to see if I could figure out what the root cause is, but all of the following options work as expected:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect an HDMI display to the HDMI port\n\n*connect an HDMI display to a Thunderbolt port via an adaptor\n\n*boot into Windows 10 (using Bootcamp) and connect the same VGA projector to a Thunderbolt port via the same adaptor\n\n\nAll this suggests it's not a problem with the adaptor, with macOS Sierra using external displays, or with the Thunderbolt ports - just with Sierra driving a VGA display.\nDoes anyone have any idea what the problem is and how I can fix it?\nEdit: I've tried resetting the NVRAM/PRAM settings and I've clicked \"Detect Displays\" a few times in Display Prefs - no success.\n\nA: Resetting MBP with display plugged in will detect it, they had the same issue with El Capitan as well. Hopefully Apple will fix this bug.\n\nA: Another person in a different forum discovered that 3rd party mini display port to VGA adapters don't work after upgrading to Sierra. I have tested and verified that this is true as well. At present time it's rather frustrating that Apple is being pesky again with forcing people to buy their expensive adapters. If you are in a rush to use it, buying one from the Apple store seems to be the way to go.\n", "Q: Adding Google Account in iOS 10 I have upgraded my iPhone to iOS 10. I am not able to add my Google account to sync my Contacts, Mail etc.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: To add Google Account, go to Settings app → Mail → Accounts → Add Account → Google and login with your Google account credentials.\nAfter logging in successfully, you should be able to configure mail and contact sync.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do I snap a photo on my iPhone with the apple earphones I have an iPhone 6s and am running iOS 10. I just tried to take a photo using the earphones volume up and down but nothing triggered. I also tried another pair of earphone, but it still didn't work. Is there a setting I'm missing? or did they disable this in iOS 10.\n\nA: I successfully took a photo via the following process with iPhone 7 & iOS 10 & the apple earbuds (with lightning connector, and also with lightning to 3.5mm jack variant of Earbuds):\nOpen the default iPhone camera app and, with earbuds connected, press volume down on the in-line remote.\nHowever, the above process did not work when the apple earbuds were replaced by a set of Anker bluetooth earbuds, paired and connected to the phone.\n", "Q: I get Pop ups on app? so I use this one app to save YouTube videos offline for later enjoyment and recently I've been getting popup messages that say \"you've won\" or something generic like that.\nThey used to appear on safari, but I erased the cache and they've since gone.\nCurrently they only appear on one app named Turbo DL.\nIs this some kind of virus? Should I backup and reinstall?\n\nA: Most likely, the app is just a wrapper for a regular web page.  You'll see everything in that app that you would see if you visited the same contents in any web browser.  Developers do this because it's easy, fast, and they can use 1 website for both Android and Apple.\nNobody can say for sure if you have a virus or not, but I'd be 95% sure it's just a normal browser popup.  I recommend writing the developer and ask about removing it or, if that fails, provide a realistic app review in the App Store.  Devs really do care about their reviews so this could get their attention.\n", "Q: No ringing for FaceTime, no alert sound for iMessage I'm not getting ringing for FaceTime and not getting alert sounds when IMessages come in. I believe I've got all my setting right, and I can see the calls coming in if the iPad is in use. Do not disturb is not on, volume is not muted, the apps all have sound settings, etc.\n\nA: I have been having the same problem. \nI won't know if it works 'till someone calls - but I have just found in Settings>Do Not Disturb>Allow Calls From, change to EVERYONE. \n\nA: I had the same problem where there was no sound notification from a FaceTime call. I found the answer at the side of the phone, a small switch for muting was turned on. It’s situated just above the volume controls. It shows a red colour when on.\n", "Q: is it possible to batch rename from a list, using a bat file like rename filename.txt newfilename.txt? So I teach a class and a few of my students have Macs. Literally the only thing I have encountered is this .bat issue.\nWe use Excel to start with a list of filenames in one column, and a list of new filenames in the other column, and then create a bat file. The new names are not intuitive and they do not follow a pattern, so typical logic can't handle this; we must rely on the list.\nDo Macs have something that can work? I would love to provide a solution.\nThis is what it looks like in windows (this assumes all files are in the same folder, and the bat file runs  from the root; it is just as possible to use fullpaths)\nrename accounting2016.xls ID0001.xls\nrename vacationphoto01.jpg ID0042.jpg\nrename BuildingPlans.docx ID0189.docx\n\n\nA: If I read the question correctly, you are generating the batch file from some sort of exporting process from the Excel columns containing the command and two file names?\nIn such a case you can just change the rename command to \"Mac equivalent\" mv. The file now contains\nmv accounting2016.xls ID0001.xls\nmv vacationphoto01.jpg ID0042.jpg\nmv BuildingPlans.docx ID0189.docx\n\nThen you can run the commands listed in the file with e.g. Bash:\nbash renames.txt\n\nNote, that if the file names contain whitespace or other special characters you should surround them with quotes, but I think that is the case also in Windows.\n\nA: Unix command line tools are what you want and you or the Mac users in your group should undertake some basic tutorials on this. It is often called shell programming.\nThe command you want here is mv (short for move) The shell script you would generate (equivalent to the batch file) would include\nmv accounting2016.xls ID0001.xls\nmv vacationphoto01.jpg ID0042.jpg\nmv BuildingPlans.docx ID0189.docx\n\nNote that this is an exact match as long as you don't use wild cards. Wildcards are treated differently in Windows command files and Unix shells there are a few things you can do with the former only. This is because the wild card expansion is done by the rename command in Windows and by the shell in Unix\n", "Q: How to make brew install a package only if it is not yet installed, and upgrade otherwise? I found it surprisingly hard to make brew either install a package (if it is missing) or upgrade it (if it is already installed). Is there no simple command / arguments to do that?\nBased on this answer, I ended up doing (at the example of the git package)\nbrew ls --versions git && brew upgrade git || brew install git\n\nafter doing a brew update, obviously. However, that still seems clumsy to me compared to other package managers.\n\nA: Homebrew doesn't support that way of use.\nTo reduce keypresses you could leverage SHELL-scripting (makes sense to add to your SHELL's .rc-file), say:\nbrewIn() { if brew ls --versions \"$1\"; then brew upgrade \"$1\"; else brew install \"$1\"; fi }\n\n— Works both in Bash and Zsh. Usage: brewIn …formulae…. But none except this.\n", "Q: Changing The Administrator name and password I just bought a used iMac. Should arrive Friday morning. I just thought of something... This is a used computer, so how am I going to delete certain files if I don't know the Administrator name or password? \n\nA: You can boot into Recovery (hold Command + R during startup) to change the password. Once booted from the recovery partition select Terminal from the Utilities menu and then enter resetpassword\nAlthough, honestly, you might just want to erase the disk and install a new copy of OS X.\n\nA: It depends on what the previous owner decided to do. Apple's guide on What to do before selling or giving away your Mac specifies to erase the computer and leave it on the Setup Assistant, which would be like you had bought the device new.\nIf the previous owner does not erase the computer or give you the admin password, you can wipe the drive and reinstall macOS yourself.\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan Installer.app has crippled my Mac Mini Mac Mini (Mid-2011), 16GB SSD, 16GB RAM, El Capitan (v10.11.6)\nThe Mac ran fine until I upgraded to Sierra. The latest Mac OS conflicted with most of the specialized apps I use every day, So I immediately returned to El Capitan.\nActivity monitor shows that two \"Installer/Installer.app\" items are always running and are they major users of all of my available memory. Consequently, all my others apps become unresponsive.  I run Disk Utility, and the Installer.app show up there as .dmg files; but I cannot erase, delete, or unmount them. None of my 3rd party app can remove the installers.\nMy Mac Mini, which should be running super-fast (as it used to), now runs dreadfully and disgustingly slow. I a truly upset with Apple for this kind of garbage. To get their help: $$$.\n\nA: Double click the process in activity monitor and look for the Open Files tab.  This should give you an idea where the process is coming from \nTry to force-quit the process in activity monitor.\nThen try to delete the dmg files (make sure they are unmounted, right-click > unmount on the dmg).\n\nA: Installer was eating up all my memory.

For development (backward testing with older OS versions) I need to install older mac OS versions.  Ideally I'd want to go as far back as Snow Leopard.\nI have an iMac with retina (model  iMac15,1).  Before I hunt and dig around for old installation media and experiment, I'd like to find out what is the oldest version that properly supports retina displays (i.e. allows for a properly readable screen)?\nThe web says Retina was introduced with Macbook Pro 2012 which would be around Mountain Lion.\nExpierences (first hand) anyone?\n\nA: The limitiation isn't so much the display as the hardware overall. You can't install OS versions older than the hardware because older versions don't bring all the required drivers etc. for various components.\nYour iMac (late 2014) came with OSX 10.10 pre-installed, so this is as far as you can go back.\n\nA: Patrix above is right.  Trying to install versions that were released prior to the hardware is the way straight into driver hell (you may or may not be able to copy some driver files from newer OS to older, which may work or not but we'll leave such stunts to Windows folks).\nSince your necessity for backward OS seems to be temporary (for testing), I'd recommend to use a virtual machine.  Desktop, VMWare Fusion, and VirtualBox should be viable solutions (as recommended here by someone answering a similar question on the apple discussion forum).  I've tried in the past (with other machines, pre retina) and it was a frustrating experience.\nIt remains to be seen how this affects retina vs. non retina though (I have no first hand experience with virtual machines and how they map retina screens to the guest OS).\n", "Q: How do I install rEFInd on a MacBook running macOS Sierra? I've disabled SIP and tried to install rEFInd on my MacBook, which is not partitioned in any way by boot camp and is one single drive. The install of rEFInd says it is installing to /Volumes/ESP for the EFI boot and completes successfully. After rebooting, however, rEFInd menu does not come up when holding option key or anything. How do I get that installed so that it is usable?\n\nA: After reading through the refind-install script (at version 0.10.4), I discovered that all I needed to do was make sure that the EFI partition was mounted.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the terminal, run diskutil list to find the EFI partition. In my case this was /dev/disk0s1. \n\n*Mount the EFI partition from the location identified in step 1. For me this was mount /dev/disk0s1\n\n*Run the rEFInd install script (from the unzipped rEFInd directory): sudo ./refind-install\nI got friendly output in my terminal: Installation has completed successfully. After this rEFInd worked on my MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Not sure if this means anything to you as I had rEFInd previously installed and not a fresh install as you are, but quick story so far\nI had rEFInd installed from the Yosemite days for dual boot OSX and KALI Linux, then updated to El Capitan and had to go back over a few of the steps to get it running again(cant remember which parts). \nI then upgraded to Sierra and thought I had lost rEFInd as I could not mount /Volumes/ESP. Running 'diskutil list' to me it looks like its now called EFI so mounted which on my machine was disk0s1 so 'diskutil mount disk0s1' allowed me to find the lost rEFInd files.\nRefollowing the steps on the excellant website 'http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html' with regards to 'Installing Manually using MAC OSX' I downloaded the latest version of rEFInd, replaced the old refind folder on the mounted EFI volume with the new, got rid of all 32bit and ARM files as to me they were not required for my 64bit machine (again as per instructions). \nWith regards to the 'bless' part I renamed ESP to EFI and added in another rEFInd folder path so it now read as \n'sudo bless --mount /Volumes/EFI --setBoot --file /Volumes/EFI/efi/refind/refind/refind_x64.efi --shortform'\nOn reboot the rEFInd bootload is now replacing the started MAC bootload and is giving me the dual option back. \nTo be honest holding 'option key' during boot allowed me to find the rEFInd bootloader, but I never put 2 and 2 together as per the change from ESP to EFI.\nThe only thing is the GRUB loader for KALI is no longer working as it used to.\nLike I say not sure if this means anything to your setup as it a fresh install, but for previously installed rEFInd it worked for me.\n\nA: Not sure if bless is a great way since they warn against it in many places. Anyway what worked for me was using the Recovery Mode with rEFind on a USB drive as given here.\n", "Q: How do I send calls from numbers not in contacts to voicemail? I'd like to send all of the calls that I receive from numbers that are not in my contacts to voicemail.\nIs this possible on ios10?\n\nA: No, this is not possible with the Phone app included in iOS 10 (nor with any earlier version).\n", "Q: Open activity monitor minimized on startup I sometimes like to have Activity Monitor running in the dock (to see CPU usage chart in the icon at a glance).  \nI didn't use it for some time though, but with a new mac I bought (El Capitan) I thought I'd activate it again.\nNow I can have it start automatically but I always have to minimize the Activity Monitor window after login.\nI think in the past6 I had set it with that option (to autostart at login  via right-click on the dock icon) so that it started minimized but I can't seem to remember how.  \nAm I remembering wrong or missing an option?\n\nA: Does this not work?\nFirst right-click on Activity Monitor and go Options > Open at Login.\nNext, open System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items and tick Hide.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get a summary of tomorrow in the Notification Centre with iOS 10? A widget I like(d) oddly much in the Notification Centre is the Tomorrow Summary, because it was a good finishing round-up to the Calendar widget. When upgrading to macOS Sierra a while back, the new update did not affect this widget. However, upgrading to iOS 10, I cannot seem to find this widget anymore. Has it been removed? Is it possible to somehow get a summary like this to show up in the Notification Centre?\n\nA: The \"Tomorrow\" built-in widget has been removed from iOS 10.\nYou could use the calendar app Fantastical. It contains a widget which can display a calendar view of the current month, with a list of events for each day, and you can tap around on the calendar to change the day being viewed without ever leaving the widget. It would require an additional tap versus the Tomorrow view, and it's not a summary so much as an actual list, but it's a decent alternative for your use case (and a great app in general, in my opinion).\n\n", "Q: Replacing annoying hold music with my own? Calling somewhere, being put on hold for 15 minutes and up, is not very pleasant. Especially if you don't like the waiting music. Now I'm not talking about the \"on hold\" music people hear when they call me; I'm talking about the music I hear when I call customer service, etc.\nNow as a programmer, I assume there is no such thing as a \"protocol\" for telephony that tells the smartphone if the user is on hold or not. But if there was, there would be a way to listen to my own music while waiting until an operator picks up my call.\nBut maybe someone figured out a way to make this possible? Does such app or feature exist, or is it as simple as that it's not implementable, because there is no way of retrieving information about whether or not the call is on hold?\n\nA: This is not a way to replace annoying hold music, but is a potential solution to being annoyed by music heard when on hold.\nWeQ4U\nWeQ4U is an app for iOS and Android (with an ugly name). Basically, you route all your calls through its numbers (included as local-rate minutes in plans) and, when you get into a queue with music, you simply hit *9 and the app continues queueing for you.\nWhile there is no protocol for saying when you're on hold and voice recognition is imperfect, I believe the app asks the call agent to use some touch tone command to indicate when you've left the queue and then the app reconnects you. You can see an example of it working in this video.\nSo you never have to hear the music at all and in fact you can listen to your own music or do anything you want in the mean time. It's a free app, the calls are normal rate (it redirects from premium numbers too) and you use fewer minutes as it calls you back once you're off hold. So yes, I'd have to say such an app or feature does exist.\nI believe this only currently works for UK numbers but there's no technical reason why it can't exist worldwide.\n", "Q: How can I get a user's associated Apple ID from the command line? I'd like to be able to retrieve the current user's associated Apple ID from a shell script. My first guess was to do so using dscl which I can get using my own user.

All packets on the network, even those destined for other hosts, are accessible through this mechanism.\nThe packet filter appears as a character special device, /dev/bpf.

Nothing has been retouched, just cropped and layered to contrast between a large menu in the back, the default size menu on this Display in the middle and a smaller sized menu up front. Calculator.app was used to show scale and as you can plainly see the size of the icons changes with the size of the grid menu.\n\n\nA: There is no way to change the size of the icons in the grid itself (the keyboard shortcut that worked in macOS Lion no longer does), but you can change it to list view by right-clicking on the folder icon and selecting List. This will result in a list similar to a Finder view, with much smaller icons.\nEdit: After further testing, the commands that I said no longer worked from Lion actually do work, at least in my testing in macOS El Capitan 10.11.6. They did not work initially, and when they finally did start working it took several seconds for anything to happen, though now they seem to be working ok.\nThey are:\nCommand-+ to make them larger, and Command-- to shrink them.\n", "Q: Imac 2006 Snow leopard Disk Image Restore Problem I have installed a new internal hard drive due to old one failing.

The install screen has a menu, from there you can choose the disk utility.  Run that and try to do the image restore from there.\n", "Q: Audio shifting balance to right headphone (MacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014 - El Capitan) I have no idea when this started as I wasn't using the headphones on the laptop for long time - so it might be since the latest minor upgrade.\nAfter listening to music for a while, the sound starts shifting the balance to the right as if someone was slowly moving the balance bar. Rarey I can hear it moving the balance left and right for a couple of seconds.\nPlease note this is not the same issue recognised by Apple where opening the sound preferences you suddenly see that the balance is actually shifted to the right (or left). My sliders are always perfectly centered.\nSometimes when it happens and I go to the \"Audio Midi Setup\" and I move the left slider, the balance restores to the center, but other times it just mute completely the left channel. When this happens, also the test sound in the \"Configure speakers...\" section stops working, for both channels even if the right one is still playing music.\nSometimes plugging out the headphones and plugging them in again restores the balance, other times it doesn't.\nThis also happens if I use an external USB amp/dac so it's not the headphone itself nor the jack.\nI tried rebooting without re-opening the apps, I've reset the SMC (actually I have no way to know if it worked as the green light in the power plug did not flash?) and NVRAM, several times. Killing coreaudiod too doesn't work.\nI used Onyx to clear the system caches (including Kernel and such) and rebooted, still nothing.\nI wouldn't like to upgrade to Sierra yet (assuming it would possibly fix it) as it seems there are too many bugs and I need the laptop to work.\nAny idea, please?\n\nA: In your question you state:  I've reset the SMC (actually I have no way to know if it worked as the green light in the power plug did not flash?)\nSo, just to be sure you've used the correct procedure for your particular MacBook Pro (i.e. one with a built-in battery you can't remove), the steps for resetting the SMC are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Safari searches instead of connecting to localhost I am launching a jupiter-notebook on port 8888, but when I try to connect with Safari the browser goes automatically to search.\nFirefox and Chrome work just fine, as Safari did before the last update. \nAnyone else with the same problem?

Help?\n\nA: Force quit Dock from Activity Monitor. Dock automatically restarts, and Cmnd+Tab should now work. Some glitch with Dock, it seems. Worked for me.\n\nA: In my case, I wasn't even able to open the Activity Monitor (or the Launchpad)\nI had to use the terminal to kill the Dock process, it restarted automatically after a few seconds\nIn the terminal, type: ps aux | grep -i dock\nNote the PID (2nd column) of the process named: \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock\"\nKill that process: kill pid.

(Detailed path: system preferences>keyboard>shortcuts>input sources) Both boxes were checked. I unchecked both. \n\nA: I have found that when you're running a Virtual Machine manager like VirtualBox sometimes an open Virtual Machine window can grab the ⌘ key (which is often used switch between VM keyboard capture mode).\nIn this case you can fix it by bring the VirtualBox Console window up (e.g. using the Dock bar icon) and tap the ⌘ key again and it should release it properly. With VMWare the settings may be different but it's worth looking at the keyboard capture/mapping options to see if a similar thing is happening.\n\nA: Launch Activity monitor, then select user tasks, and shut down the process called 'dock'.  This worked like a charm for me.  Problem solved, instantly.  Well, it took about ten seconds while the dock rebooted itself, then command tab worked like a charm as usual, no restart needed.\n", "Q: Why OS X never ejects drives before shutdown or suspend mode? I have this problem since Lion if I am not mistaken. If a leave an USB or even my FireWire (backup) HDD connected OS X does not eject the drives before shutting down or entering suspend mode.\nWhy?\nI am using now macOS Sierra and the problem persist.\nIt bothered me for a while till I started unmounting the drives after using them.\nBut I need to keep my FireWire HDD connected to use Time Machine's backup.\nHow can I solve that since even with fresh installs of Mac OS X it happens?\n\nA: I will share a why it is good to have it as is and a way around it if you are determined. \n\nWhen you put the Mac to sleep, it will try and also put the external\n  drive to sleep, thus parking its heads and turning off the drives. It\n  won't eject it, however, so you can use it as soon as you wake your\n  Mac again without having to mount it.\nThe benefit is that you don't have to worry about mounting it, as in\n  most cases this would involve turning the drive off and on again,\n  reconnecting the plug, or using diskutil from a Terminal—quite time\n  consuming. Since I use my drive for Time Machine, I don't want to have\n  to think about connecting it every time I wake my Mac.\nThe only downside I see is that you could accidentally plug the drive\n  out. In that case, the Mac will wake up, and show you the error about\n  a drive being disconnected without properly ejecting it. Since all\n  data is written to the drive before going to sleep, this shouldn't\n  cause any data loss though.\nAll in all, it's much more comfortable to just keep the drive mounted.\n\nIf you want to unmount the drives before sleep:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the automator > files/folders > eject disk > tell it when\nto eject.\n\n*Use terminal to unmount all drives before sleep. < not comfortable giving you the code as it can vary.\n\n", "Q: Notes gone after upgrade to iOS 10.0.2 I have just updated my iPad Air to 10.0.2 and now cannot find any Notes. I have checked iCloud and there is nothing there. Irrespective of whether a backup was made, upgrading should not remove user entered data, so why has this version upgrade removed all my notes?\n\nA: I also lost various notes. I went to settings, iCloud and my notes were not turned on for iCloud backup storage. I turned it on, and voila, my notes were back on \"my iPad\"\n\nA: Certain notes of mine disappeared also. So, I restored an iCloud backup from 4 days ago, when I still had all of my notes, and they're still missing. I think what's causing it is the new little intro screen you see the first time you click on notes. After you click ok or advance or whatever, you go to the screen \"Gmail\" or \"cloud\" where you pick which notes you want to look at. Gmail has my notes, and sadly many or missing. \nWhat's odd is that somehow while accessing notes a week ago (before I installed IOS10), I got kicked into the screen \"Gmail or cloud\". I chose Gmail, and found a select few notes were missing. So I restored from a backup and all of my notes were there again.\nNow, after updating, I have the exact same problem, but this time, restore from iCloud didn't fix the problem. I wish it'd just let me go directly to the notes on my phone without making me choose the source like before. My gut tells me that's what's causing the issue.\n", "Q: Cannot debug configd To debug configd it is suggested by man page to run it using \n$ usr/libexec/configd -d \n\nAnd you would kill it before launching it using SIGTERM otherwise it will launch again as follows:\n$ sudo killall -SIGTERM configd     \n\nFrom man page of configd\n\n SIGNALS\n configd was designed to run without any intervention but if you insist on sending a signal to the dae-mon daemon\n mon then the following are available:\n\n SIGHUP   This signal, typically used to tell a daemon to reload its configuration, is ignored (there is\n          no configuration).\n\n SIGTERM  This signal initiates a \"graceful\" shutdown of the daemon.\n\n\nProblem is that SIGTERM is not gracefully killing configd.

Now, it sometimes takes 45 mins to over an hour to turn on while it's plugged in.\nIt also dies very easily. It can be at 100% battery, then within 10 minutes it's at 60%. Sometimes my phone even turns off at 100 or 50%.\nCan somebody explain why this happens or what I should do? Is my battery broken?\n\nA: This makes great sense if your battery is aging in the normal way for a lithium cell. The automatic turn on happens when the voltage level from the battery raises above a set limit and when the battery is new, it won't discharge as deeply or take as long to rebound when you re-apply charging current.\nA simple battery exchange would remedy the situation if you care to remedy this. Just knowing it's normal and expected might let you decide to just be more patient and not drain the battery past 15% so you don't have to wait when you plug it in.\nThe shutting off is another sign of aging - that won't get better and you can't wait that out - so replace the battery or have the phone serviced if you need that part of the operation more stable.\n\nA: You may need a battery replacement or bring it to Apple\n", "Q: Is Apple changing OS X branding to macOS retroactively? I have seen certain places where it is claimed that Apple is retroactively rebranding Mac OS X/OS X as macOS now that Sierra has launched. Some people disagree that this is occurring since as of now, not everything (not even the majority of material) reflects the change.\nIs there solid evidence of this changeover?\n\nA: Yes, there is proof of this change in several places.\nFirst and foremost, it should be made clear that this change is not being applied to old OS releases in the sense that if you boot into an OS prior to 10.12 Sierra, and go to Apple menu > About This Mac, you will not see it suddenly say \"macOS\" instead of \"Mac OS X\" or \"OS X\". The change is in relation to documentation and references in updated software, such as the startup disk selection screen in Sierra.\nHere is a screenshot to illustrate:\n\nThere are places on Apple's own website where the change can be seen (although, again, it is not nearly everywhere).\nThis developer page about Xcode states:\n\nXcode 8 requires a Mac running macOS El Capitan version 10.11.4 or later.\n\nIn the description of a video from a session at WWDC 2016, there is this language:\n\nLaunched last year with iOS 9 and macOS El Capitan, the new Transit feature ...\n\nFound on this marketing page, in a footnote describing system requirements is this text:\n\nSome features require iOS 9 and macOS El Capitan.\n\nThere are a couple of Apple support articles, listed below, which refer to a number of OS versions in a row behind macOS.\nIf your web browser says that it's missing the Quicktime plug-in:\n\nThis plug-in is no longer enabled in macOS Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite, and Mavericks.\n\nPrinter and scanner software for macOS Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite, and Mavericks. (This one is right there in the title.)\nOther companies/projects are recognizing this, too, such as PostgreSQL:\n\nApple has decided to rename Mac OS X to \"macOS\", and apparently is now retroactively referring to old releases that way too.\n\n\nA: It is weird, as Apple officially abandoned the Mac OS-X in favor of OS-X. I saw and heard it personally in the opening keynote of one of the previous WWDC - can't recall which. \nWhen they did - I thought it might signify their plans to extend supported hardware beyond Macintosh computers to other hardware. \nIf you are correct, and Apple intentionally restore their old brand name for Mac OS (actually the branding used for Mac OS Classic) than maybe such plans were deserted?\n", "Q: How do you use Family Sharing to effectively merge multiple Apple IDs? My wife and I have separate Apple IDs. To simplify (!) things a while ago we both started using a third ID.  \nNow with Family Sharing we can each access the other's purchases.\nSo I set myself up as the family organizer, invited Laura, and invited the 3rd account.\nWell to accept the invitation for the third account, I would have to sign out of iCloud, loosing a bunch of data, or possibly having merge problems later.  \nThe invitation has to be opened in Mail. I try not to use Mail. I certainly didn't want to not only sign out of iCloud, but also configure yet another account on Mail.  (The third Apple ID forwards to both of us.)\nWhat to do?\n\nA: .The answer turned out to be only slightly convoluted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a new user on my mac, tempaccount.\n\n*Login as new user.\n\n*Use 3rd id as my icloud login.\n\n*Set up my gmail account as the Mail account.

It's like vibrations. I have tried different cables, plugs and charged in different locations and the same every time.\n\nA: This is so commonly misunderstood that I shall attempt to provide a short précis, then link to a good explanation which is not overly-technical.\nCommon misconception - earthing/grounding\nMost small household appliances are not, in fact, earthed at all - even if there is a valid earth pin on the mains plug.\nThey are what is known as 'double insulated' & carry this logo\n\nThe 'transformers' on this type of equipment are not the same as in high-power equipment & don't use a step-down coil transformer, linear supply. Instead they use a switch-mode supply.\nAll PSUs, whether linear or switch-mode leak a small amount of current due to capacitance. In double-insulated devices there is no true ground/earth so the design is optimised to try to prevent this leakage.\nUnfortunately, switch-mode supplies run at very high frequencies, so the smaller capacitance in the smaller transformer ends up leaking just as much as the larger capacitance in a larger transformer running at 50 or at 60Hz for example. \nThe leakage current is usually less than 1mA and is often as low as 10uA, but even at such low current, it can still be present and still can cause problems.\nSo - the tingle or buzz that you feel is in fact you becoming the temporary ground/earth for this circuit.\nIt is usually safe, & any reputable manufacturer will ensure their PSUs are well within tolerance.\nCheap copies are cheap because they don't bother with most of the safety circuitry… you know, the stuff that makes the expensive one expensive in the first place ;-)\nHave look at http://www.unitechelectronics.com/sparks.htm for a much more detailed explanation. Though it is aimed at hi-fi users & deals in 240v mains, the basic principles are identical.\n[copied from my own answer on Super User]\n", "Q: Standards for iOS system notifications Are there any standards or regulations concerning iOS system notifications?

As for Mac notebooks, the file is used, but remains in the file system. \nThe security problem there is that password is in the cleartext for anyone that bothers to open the file.\nThe alternative to keep the web site, may well be not delivering the password in the profile. \nDoes mobile profile functionally support obfuscating the user password field in some way?\nP.S. I am aware other alternative is to setup an alternative authentication scheme to users with non-critical passwords. It is not the answer that I am after on this context of Apple devices.\n\nA: Apparently, from the mobile configuration file, it is enough to go the user definition:\n<key>XAuthName</key>\n<string><<LOGIN>></string>\n<key>XAuthPassword</key>\n<string><<PASSWORD>></string>\n\nAnd from there, delete the XAuthPassword key and string/attribute. \nAs XAuthName is there during the deployment, the password will be asked, as thus wont be in cleartext format inside the provisioning file.\n", "Q: Launchpad fails to show app icons contained in folders Randomly, my Launchpad is failing to show app icons contained in folders.\n\nIs there a way to fix it?\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nUntil now resetting the Launchpad database worked for me.

I have recently bought a pressure sensitive Huion 1060pro+ tablet. It's comparable to a medium-level Wacom.\nOn my Macbook Pro 15\" 2009 the pressure sensitivity when working in Illustrator has a rather long lag, sometimes 15 seconds between pressing the pen down harder and the brush stroke becoming thicker. This is the same in both normal brush and blob brush, and Illustrator CC 2013 and CC 2015.\nThis delay does not happen on Photoshop, or on my girlfriend's Macbook Pro running Illustrator CS6. The hardware on my girlfriend's Macbook is comparable to mine, except for the graphics card - mine has a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M 256 MB, hers has an Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB.\nI'm thinking that perhaps my card can't process the changed shape of the vector quickly enough to provide an immediate response.\nI'm interested in what you guys think, and if you have any suggestions for improving its performance short of buying a new laptop.\n\nA: OK, so after upgrading my Macbook to something with much more horsepower the problem still existed, but to a lesser degree. I also updated Illustrator, but unfortunately couldn't roll back to CS6. \nThe issue was lesser, but still a major problem. I just bought a similarly priced Wacom Intuos, and the experience is better in every way. No lag, perfect pressure sensitivity, and no sensation of long brush strokes becoming increasingly angular as they develop. Likely a poorly written driver from Huion - I would often find that pressure sensitivity would drop off the grid entirely until I restarted the driver process.\nMoral of the story is not to buy Huion, unfortunately.\n", "Q: Where has the \"define\" ability gone when selecting a word in an SMS message or email?

How do I disable this? After updating my iPhone 6 to iOS 10, all calls coming from Viber and Skype are appearing in the calls list as normal phone calls. Also, when I'm on a Viber call and a real phone call comes, I don't get notified. Before iOS 10 it used to mute Viber and give me a notification than someone is calling.  How do I return back to these settings?\n\nA: I don't think it is possible to revert back to old settings now. I have opened a ticket with apple to get the users freedom to either use or not use. The setting like Setting -> Phone -> Service provider makes perfect sense. Lets see if apple provides this capabilities or not.\n\nA: EDIT: I messed up and this is an article from an ios10 preview version. This setting seems to not exist anymore. So as far as I know, reverting to the old way is not possible :/\n\nThis change is due to Viber and Skype now using CallKit which you can read up on here.\nIn that article it says this:\n\nIt’s important to note that Apple won’t force you to let any VoIP app integrate with Phone without your permission. Just like you must authorize third-party apps to access your camera or microphone, CallKit-enabled apps will put up a new type of iOS prompt at first run asking for permission to use CallKit.\n\nMakes perfect sense in my eyes. A little further down they say this: \n\nAny VoIP apps that you’ve permitted to use CallKit will honor your current Do Not Disturb setting and a list of blocked contacts. Lastly, you can revoke these permissions for VoIP apps by flipping switches in Settings → Phone → Service Providers.\n\nSo going to Service Providers and disabling access to CallKit should revert it back to the way you want.\n\nA: At least for Skype you can disable callkit integration by opening the Skype app and going to \"My info\" -> Settings -> disable \"Integrated calling\".\n\nA: This problem has been solved automatically, I am not sure if it is because of IOS 10.1.1 or an update to viber app, currently it gives me a waiting beep/screen while I am on viber call and getting a normal call, didn't test yet with other apps like skype/whatsapp\n\nA: In IOS 8.0.1, call logs can be deleted for everyone in viber, after that you wont be able to see calls or messages that has been made :)\n", "Q: Trying to set boot-args with nvram gets \"general error\" on Sierra I'm trying to temporarily disable KEX signing enforcement on my MBP since my company's VPN client (GlobalProtect) is failing the signature check now.  This started yesterday when I did the OS upgrade to Sierra yesterday.\nThe solution should be running this command:\nsudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1\n\nThe problem is that I am getting the following response, and I can't figure out what it means or what to do about it (meaning I can't connect to my company network, too).\nnvram: Error setting variable - 'boot-args': (iokit/common) general error\n\nDoes anybody have any ideas of things I could try or otherwise look at to track down the problem?\nThanks.\n\nA: The kext signing restriction was integrated into System Integrity Protection starting in El Capitan, and as a result the old disable flag no longer works. But there's a new way to do it: boot in recovery mode, and run the command csrutil enable --without kext. I haven't tested it, but my understanding is that this will turn off the kext requirements, while leaving the rest of SIP enabled. If that doesn't do it, try csrutil disable to turn SIP off entirely. \n\nA: According to Apple KB : Prepare your institution for iOS 10 and macOS Sierra\n\n...you must use the nvram command to properly set boot-args NVRAM variable. Starting with macOS Sierra, you must be booted to the recovery partition to run this command.\n\n\nA: I got the similar issue and resolved the with the help above solution.Thanks..\n\n\n*\n\n*Get into Recovery Mode by restarting and holding down ⌘+R until Apple logo appears.\n\n*In the top menu click Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*In the Terminal window type:\ncsrutil enable --without kext\n\nand press Enter.\n\n*Then restart the Mac.\n\n\nA: You need to apply that when in recovery mode. Enter in Recovery mode and then apply the following in the terminal:\nnvram boot-args=\"serverperfmode=1 ncl=262144\"\nThen, reboot. After rebooting, check the parameter on the terminal via nvram -p\n", "Q: How do I scale everything up on my Mac Screen without decreasing resolution? Most forums I found on Google mentions that the easiest way to zoom things up on a Mac Display is to set the resolution lesser. But, that just stretches the lesser resolution screen leading to blurry visuals. \nI'm in fact searching for something on Mac like this which is offered on Windows PCs\n\n\nHow do I do that having the same resolution set?\n\nPS: This question is similar to this post except that I want everything (including top bar, icons, everything literally) unlike just changing the font size\n\nA: On retina Macs it is in System Preferences > Display (see this article). Switch it to \"scaled\" and it should show multiple choices that look like this:\n\n\nA: Enable HiDP for your non-Retina display\nhttps://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi\nUsage\n1.Remote Mode: Run this script in Terminal\n\nbash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi/master/hidpi.sh)\"\n\nIn my case, I ran the script then press (1) Enable HiDPI, then (6) Remain as it is, then I pick my screen resolution.\nYour setup process may be different. Check the github link for more instructions and discussions.\nAfter completing setup, restart the computer. Then open Display preference and you can adjust scaling setting and it'll looks sharp on your non-Retina display.\nDisclaimer: I'm not the creator of the script and:\nSome device have wake-up issue, script's second option may help, it inject a patched EDID, but another problem may exists here.\n\nLogo scaling up may not be resolved, cuz the higher resolution is faked.\n\n\nA: Essentially this is only available on the newer Macs with Retina display.  They have a slider similar to that in Windows with four or five different sizing levels (more data (more content, small text), more detail (less content)). \nAlso, there is a similar topic on Stackoverflow Simulate HiDPI via Quartz Debug but I'm not sure how useful this is in every day situations.\n\nA: I will offer this technique as well, just in case you are looking for \"temporary\" resizing. I use this method during online meetings to quickly Zoom-in for the attendees better visibility.\nI enable Accesibilty features in System Preferences..\nI added \"control\" and \"Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom\nWhile sharing my screen, (or not), I can hold down control - Mouse-wheel. or control - 2-finger-drag\n\n\nA: The pixels on a display are a grid. Either you're using the native hardware grid of the display, or you're mapping some smaller virtual grid onto the hardware grid by scaling the image up. Scaled images can be either an integer value (e.g. 1 pixel to 2 pixels), or a fractional value (e.g. 1 pixel to 1.25 pixels).\nIf you're scaling the image by a fractional value: e.g. 1.25 (125%), then the OS has to do more anti-aliasing, which is a kind of 'smudging' color over several pixels to fake fractions of a pixel.\nWindows scaling uses less anti-aliasing, and rounds things to the nearest pixel, making the image sharper, but less accurate in size and position. MacOS's anti-aliasing is more accurate, but uses more sub-pixel artefacts, which can look blurry, particularly on lower-density pixel displays.\nIn short: you can't select a fractional scaling without some loss of sharpness.\nApple's default 2x scaling for Retina displays should yield the best results. If you're using a non-Retina screen, then using an integer scaling will yield the sharpest results, but bear in mind that the pixel density isn't as small.\n", "Q: Just turned on icloud for phone, but moved contacts from Outlook on local machine Hi and thanks in advance for any help provided! I just upgraded my phone to a 6s and turned on iCloud. That moved all my contacts from phone and Outlook on local machine to the cloud.  I would like to maintain contacts and calendars locally. How to I bring items back out of the cloud?\nJim\n\nA: Open the Settings app of your iPhone, and scroll down to iCloud. There, switch off the slider at \"Contacts\". After a warning message, the contacts will be deleted from your cloud and are stored only locally on your device again. You can then start to sync your contacts with outlook again, probably by using iTunes.\n", "Q: Can't connect to SMB share after Sierra upgrade After the upgrade to Sierra on my MacBook Air, I'm unable to connect to the NAS on my home network through Samba.

I have a linux server with 2 IP's on my local network, one is set as the DMZ ip on my router that I bind public-facing stuff to (just web and ssh server), the other is internal-only like BIND, etc.\nTurns out, when I switched my network from 10.x.x.x to 192.168.x.x, I forgot to update my netmask from 8 bits to 24 bits.  Once I did that, share worked immediately.  This makes sense as smbd/nmbd need a proper broadcast address for discovery.  So check your server and make sure that your mask is correct for your the IP block you're using.\nAlso, try disabling jumbo frames on the server (make sure MTU is < 2000)\n\nA: I had the same error and solved it. The problem was an entry in the smb.conf of my server. In the [global]-section there was an entry smb ports = 139. If this setting is active the server accepts connections only with port 139 but not with port 445.\nAfter deleting this line and restarting the server the connection was established as expected.\nSo check if your NAS accepts connections with port 445. I think Sierra uses port 445 with the smb-client.\n\nA: Try this on terminal:\necho \"[default]\" >> ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf; echo \"smb_neg=smb1_only\" >> ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf\nor try\ncifs://servername instead of smb://servername\n", "Q: Karabiner quit working in Sierra.

All of my applications were crashing randomly and what not so I decided to just try and reinstall El Capitan onto it. I tried and tried and tried but only got an error about how it couldn't be installed on that computer.\nSo then I went and completely reformatted my hard drive and booted up with Internet Recovery. Told it to install Mac OS X Lion again (that's what came with my computer) and I am now getting the following errors when I look at the installer log:\n\nLine 1: Install Mac OS X Lion [379]: Chunk validation failed, retrying...\nLine 2: Failed to verify InsallESD.dmg: hdiutil verify failed\nLine 3: Damaged resume data :/Volumes/Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB Media/Mac OS X Install Data/InstallESD.dmg.partial : /Volumes/Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB Media/Mac OS X Install Data/InstallESD.chunklist.partial\n\nI'm leaning towards the conclusion that my SSD has gone bad even though it's only a little over a year old.\nHowever, I thought I would post here too in case anyone else has had this problem and was able to fix it without getting a new hard drive.\nIt's also worth noting that when I use Disk Utility to check the disc for errors it doesn't find anything.\nUPDATE\nI just tried to install onto my old mac hard drive and I'm getting the same error. After some more research I saw that some say if you upgraded ram to take out the ram from one of the slots and try again. I'm going to try that when I get home and see if that works.\n\nA: Pulling one of the RAM sticks out before trying to reinstall the OS did the trick for me!\nWhen I first bought my MacBook 5 years ago it only came with 4GB of RAM. About a year and a half ago I upgraded this to 8GB. For whatever reason this throws errors and won't let you reinstall Mac OS X again.\nSo what I did was turned the MacBook off and flipped it over and took off the bottom cover. I then removed one of the sticks of RAM (the one on top) and restarted the computer and tried installing again. This time it installed without any issues and after it was installed I put the other stick of RAM back in again.\nBelow is a link to an Apple Support article detailing how to remove RAM from a MacBook Pro.\nMacBook Pro: How to remove or install memory\n\nA: I had this same issue on a MacBookPro9,2 and I tracked down the problem to a defective SATA controller on the motherboard. Apparently the SATA controller fails commonly on 2012 MacBooks. The Internet Recovery install process downloads chunks of the install packages to a staging area on the target volume, and if you have a faulty SATA controller that writes corrupted data, it's common to have chunks that don't pass validation after being written to disk.\nI managed to get past the specific hdiutil verify failed error by using the Disk Utility and restoring the installation DMG image onto a USB memory stick, then  performing the OS installation from the memory stick. When running the installation from a USB drive without connection to a wi-fi rather than performing an Internet Recovery, the installer won't try to re-download packages if they fail verification, and just moves on.\nPrior to the SATA diagnosis, I also tried to pull back the date and remove one of the two 4GB memory SODIMMs, but neither had an impact on the error.\nSo, if others need a manner to get past this specific error (at their own risk), they key is to switch from an Internet Recovery install to a regular USB install.\nIn my case, the install log would still contain verification failures and the final install was still corrupted because of the faulty SATA controller, and the issue was finally remedied by moving the disk to an external USB enclosure and installing the OS there.\n", "Q: How to block all texts from bit.ly? I have started to get text messages from bit.ly on my iPhone 6. It doesn't have a number—it just says \"bit.ly\".\nI am confused that how can something which has no number is sending me text messages. I want to block it completely and totally. No one from bit.ly should ever be able to send me a text message.\nHow can it be blocked?\nWhen I open the text message and click on bit.ly, I see the following options\n\n\n*\n\n*send my current location \n\n*share my location \n\n*do not disturb\n\n\nHow to block bit.ly from sending me text messages?\n\n\n\nA: To block this type of call:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new contact called something like Non-Caller, No-Caller or Bit.ly\n\n*Enter 000-000-0000 for the phone number.\n\n*Scroll down and select Block this Caller\nThis should stop calls from calls that come from \"zero\" numbers.\nI just remembered this tips to block No Caller calls -> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6040239?tstart=0 \n\nA: I read the Wired article but it is out of date.....here is what I just did (for iPhone users)...go to settings/messages....scroll down and turn on Filter Unknown Senders.  It will turn off notifications from unknown senders and sort them into a different folder.\n\nA: *\n\n*Click the blue info sign in the top right hand corner\n\n*Click the profile button where it has a placeholder image and bit.ly\n\n*\"Block this Caller\" will be the last option\n\n\nI just got a text from them saying \"Premier Investor Report\". Weird…\n\nA: your mobile carrier is the best place to block messages since they actually delivered the specific message to your specific handset. They allow caller-id to be spoofed or not and choose how to route messages.\n\n*\n\n*ask them to disable email to SMS for your account to start.\n\n*Then use their spam reporting mechanism\n\n*Lastly, use Apple’s block contact and block calls feature to block any that persist in bugging you once the main avenues in are shut\n\nIf you can't figure out the exact sending number on your device - you should get support from them to review your bill and your service details. Once you know one or two instances how spam messages are arriving - you can decide to block them, turn off SMS entirely or configure the iOS side to handle messages from numbers that are not in your contact list separately from messages from people or services you have \"white listed\".\nThe other way would be to disable iMessage for a time and focus on SMS delivery to get it cleaned out - sometimes it's hard to know which is which when both arrive in the same app.\n\nA: This is spam. It is not from bit.ly\nWhen you get it via iMessages then it can be originated from a mobile number or an email address.\nTry pressing (i) and then bit.ly in the description field, you should get the details and from there you will be able to block.\n\nA: The only way to block this sender is via your carrier. It is with your carrier's \"blessings\" that this sender is spamming you, and your carrier is getting paid for this.\nIt happened to me a few years ago. I was getting spammed by several companies in my home country, and I traced this to my carrier. They admitted doing it, and even openly advertised it as a service for companies to reach out to potential customers. It was exactly as you describe it: instead of a phone number in the sender's field, there was a text with the name of the company, and it was impossible to reply or block the sender through the phone's settings.\nI called my carrier to complain on multiple occasions, and even threatened with legal action.\n", "Q: There is not a GO button in the menu bar Any idea how to add a GO button to my menu bar to the MAC PRO?\nMenu bar I have contains:  Safari  File  Edit  View  History  Bookmarks Window  Help   \nNO \"GO\" Bar  \n\nA: Start Finder: then the menu bar reads:\nFinder File Edit View GO Window Help.\nIt is a Finder menu not Safari menu that has GO.\n", "Q: Final Cut X- Not Enough Media Error - for transitions I am on my trial here with version 10.2.3, its great but I get the above error when trying to put in transitions sometimes.\nHow to fix?\n\nA: The error generally appears when the clips you are transitioning between do not have enough media to overlap.

But instead of the video starting I go to full screen. How do I stop this behavior?\n\nA: I have discovered that I can go to full screen with a double click. If the double click speed is too fast it won't do it so there has to be a couple seconds between clicks, so I think that what is happening is that I am clicking the tap where the video is and then clicking in the screen and the time between the two clicks is the right amount to put me in full screen.

Short question : When backing up you mac to via Time machine to a 3rd party NAS (non time capsule, but instead something like a Synology or Drobo NAS). Can the time machine backups become corrupted and unusable, either due to the laptop / computer being turned off, disconnected from the network or for some other reason. \nLong question : Im evaluating using Time Machine vs Carbon Copy Cloner as a backup solution. When speaking to Carbon Copy Cloner they mentioned that backing up to a NAS as opposed to a direct HDD wasnt the best idea as the backup could become corrupted, im going to ask them why this might be, but i also wanted some impartial input, any ideas why this might be and would Time Machine suffer the same issues ? \n\nA: Time Machine really wants an HFS- formatted volume. Try creating a sparse disk image on the NAS and backing up to the image. \n\nA: In case you did not invest already in a NAS. I had to decide the same question.\nI bought a thunderbolt HDD enclosure and attached it to a Macmini Server. This way I can format all the drives in HFS+. In case you have an old Mac you can run macOS server on it and I would prefer this solution!\nRegarding Backup scenarios there are advantages and disadvantages to both.\nTimemachine can only backup your system disk or everything. This means that in some cases you would need a massive networked volume to backup. This would usually require RAID and RAID and backup are incompatible! But Timemachine keeps history and you can easily browse the backed up data.\nCarbon copy is an excellent programme. You can backup whole drives or folders. It is highly customizable. It has a function called SafetyNet which keeps history, but it is much more difficult to browse and recover.\nI use Timemachine for systemdisks and Carboncopy for secondary internal drives. This way I do not need to build RAID volumes to be able to backup multiple drive machines.\nI backup to networked volumes. Server, switch and 4bay thunderbolt enclosure are attached to an UPS.\nNAS are great, but when apple updates something you could get problems with compatibility.\nSince Timemachine is a proprietary technology I would try to do without NAS and go with an HDD I can attach to a Mac and format in HFS+. Backup solutions should be as simple as possible and the complexer the setting, the easier something gets corrupted. NAS means usually RAID, ext3 and so on. Too many possible points of failure! Too many things which could get corrupted.\nEdit:\nIn case of a Carbon Copy backup to a networked volume on NAS you would backup to a non HFS. This can cause problems especially with metadata, permissions, ... Timemachine backs up to sparsfile, CCC mirrors your data to a volume. Timemachine sparsefiles can get corrupted, CCC might loose permissions, metadata.\n", "Q: Mac book pro early 2011 won't boot my mac book pro 2011 started having weird instances where it would just cut off and shut down immediately.

However, two weeks ago, it failed. The story surrounding this apparently sudden failure is that I was running an update of Safari that involved needing to do a restart. Immediately after doing the restart, the electricity for our home went out, it was only out for around a minute. Luckily the computer was plugged into a surge protector... Or not.\nLater that day, when I tried to turn it on, it turned on but wouldn't boot passed the Apple Screen with the small, gray progress bar. \nIt is still basically in that same state. However, after some reading on the internet and trying a variety of things booting to \"Command+S\" as well as \"Command+R\". What happened when I ran \"Command+R\" was somewhat depressing. The Mac is completely unaware of the fact that it has a 500GB Western Digital HDD in it (which I can hear turning) and if I run Disk Utility, it will spend hours looking for that drive.\nWhat I tried today was reinstalling the OS (failed), booting it with SpinRite and booting it from a 64GB external drive (worked). Once I booted to the external drive, I ran disk utility which I started at around 1400 hours, it is now 1500 hours and it just now found its hard drive. A warning popped up and indicated that the drive could not be repaired. I am now running First Aid on it, just curious to see what if anything it can do there. \nI do not totally know what my question here is. Other than, if what I am trying right now doesn't work, what should I do? Should I just give up and drag the thing to an Apple Store? I have data on it that I must recover (sadly I had nothing backed up).\nTo Summarize: If what I am doing right now doesn't work, what - if anything - can I do next? Are there any other at-home fixes I can try before taking it to an Apple Store? \nNote: I own one other Mac that is exactly the same as the one that is not working, I also own portions of 38 other older Macs and part of a broken one that is also this computer's twin. (I added this in case anyone recommends any form of testing, or needing certain parts).\n\nA: I just had a hdd fail in my imac last week. So I know this method works:\nGet all important files off of the hdd with Lazesoft Mac Data Recovery. You'll have to copy the files to another disk. If you have enough space, the one you used to boot with might be enough. It takes a LONG time to copy files off of a disk that will not mount in the OS! Be patient.\nFrom there it's up to you. Personally I'd replace the failed drive. If it failed once, it will fail again. But if you have the luxury of time and patience, you can try to erase/reformat it yourself then copy the files back... hope for the best.\nOtherwise, take it to Apple. They'll replace the drive and copy the data for you (if possible). They'll also break your bank =) They won't even give you a price over the phone!\nI went with UBreakIFix. $100 got the replacement done. But I had to copy the files myself as described above. Also they didn't do the jumpers right so the fans come on at 100% until I put in a software solution to fix that. A lackluster experience for sure. But if you go in there with the knowledge of the SMC/fan situation, they'll probably set it up correctly for you.\n\nA: It could be both HDD hardware fault or screwed up HDD directory.\nThe power outage would indicate a possible directory problem. When you power down some data may be written. When the power is cut off, the system may get corrupted.\nA faulty drive should give other problems before it stops working.\nYou could try booting into target disc mode:\nstart up while holding down the T key.\nWhile using a FireWire or thunderbolt cable to attach your faulty machine to a second machine. From this second machine you could test the drive.\nYou could also put the faulty drive in an external drive enclosure.\nDisk Utility is not helpful in any way!

Deleted EFI Partition During my Windows 7 installation (via BootCamp) I came to screen that looks similar to this picture. \n\nI chose to delete and format the EFI partition (~200 MB) and and the other small partition (~629 MB). I was confused why I had those partitions in the first place so I just wanted to get rid of them. I did not delete my main Mac OS X partition though. Just the two small partitions, thinking nothing of it. \nAfter the install of Windows 7, I realized I could no longer get back into Mac OS X. The only OS I could boot into (when I held the 'option key' at start-up) was Windows. My Mac OS X system had vanished! \nI really need to save the files on my computer. I tried to research this issue with many other articles. Through many troubleshooting acts of desperation, I now can't even boot into my Windows installation.  \nIt appears that the data should all be there. It's currently showing two partitions within my SSD. One is about 88 GB (would be my Mac OS) and the other is about 35 GB (would be my Windows OS). \nVerify and Repairing the disk does not help... I have tried. I am currently accessing Terminal and Disk Utility thru the Apple Online Recovery feature. \nIn the Disk Utility image below, my Mac OS is 'disk0s2' and my Windows is 'disk0s4':\n\nAdditionally, here are some terminal pictures that showcase my disk:\n\n\n\n\nA: I have been able to salvage at least the OS X partition by accessing the Mac remotely via TeamViewer and restoring the old CoreStorage Logical Volume Group.\nHere are the steps to recover the OS X volume:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery Mode\n\n*Attach a 16 GB thumb drive\n\n*Install a full system to the thumb drive. In Internet Recovery Mode the original system the Mac was delivered with is installed: Mountain Lion\n\n*After booting from the thumb drive and configuring an admin account the system was updated to El Capitan.\n\n*wxHexEditor (a raw disk editor) and TeamViewer (remote access) were installed.\n\n\n\nAfter checking the disk with disktutil list, diskutil cs listand sudo gpt -r show disk0 the following picture emerged:\n\n\n*\n\n*the disk had a MBR instead of a pMBR\n\n*a CoreStorage Volume was configured but the Physical Volume was corrupted - no Logical Volume Family and Logical were available.\n\n*No volume - neither OS X nor NTFS or recovery volume was working\n\n\nTo restore a GUID partition table the MBR had to be overwritten with\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=512 count=1\n\nand a new GUID partition table had to be created:\nsudo gpt destroy disk0\nsudo gpt create -f disk0\n\nadded a new EFI partition:\nsudo gpt -i 1 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk0\n\nand copied the EFI of the thumb drive to disk0s1:\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1s1 of=/dev/disk0s1 bs=4m\n\nNow I tried to determine if the main OS X partition was CoreStorage or non-CoreStorage with wxHexEditor:\nIn normal HFSJ volumes block 409640 and 409641 of the disk (=block one and two of the OS X partition) usually contain zeros and block 409642 the string \"HFSJ\" in the first 16 bytes. The first block of a CoreStorage contains some non-zeros - the next two blocks are equal to non-CoreStorage partitions.\nBlock 409640 had some non-zeros, so I assumed it was \"corestoraged\".\nThe end of a CoreStorage Volume Group can be determined by characteristic strings in plist-like invisible objects in the \"administrative area\" of the CoreStorage Volume Group.\n\nThe string \"physicalVolumes\" has four occurrences near the end of an LVG. The last occurrence is in the 8185th last block of the LVG. By searching for the strings with wxHexEditor the last block was determined.\nWith the example above that's 511246241792/512 + 8184 = block 998536000. The block number has to be divisable by eight for 512-disks.\nWith the last block of the LVG the second partition can be added with:\nsudo gpt -i 2 409640 -s 998536000 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\n\nThe broken volume reappeared. The disk was then verified and repaired as well as the volumes. It took several attempts to repair all errors of the volume. I didn't try to recover the Windows 7 partition.\nThe main volume was fully bootable. All data was backed up and the drive was re-partitioned. A new system was installed and the backup data was transferred with the Migration Assistant.\n", "Q: command line: unmount a smb network drive We use Windows Server for my company network.\nI do use Mac has client.

I don't know which app in the folder is updating, but the one not in the folder is Memrise.\nI looked in the preferences, and Memrise is not even listed in the long list of apps that have settings.  There is no settings icon on the main screen of Memrise, and I can't log in until I look up my password.  This never happened before the iOS 10 upgrade.\nWhat might this be and how to stop it?\n\nA: Apps cannot update themselves. The only way for an app to update is through the App Store.\nTo disable the App Store automatically downloading updates, open the Settings app, tap on iTunes & App Store, then toggle Updates off under Automatic Downloads (so it is white, not green).\nNote this will disable automatic updating for all apps, not just specific ones. You cannot disable automatic updating on a per-app basis.\nWhen automatic updates are off, you need to open the App Store to update your apps. Go to the Updates tab and tap Update across from each app listed to update it.\n", "Q: Find my iPhone: how to identify each device? A friend of mine got her iPhone stolen. When entering iCloud to activate the \"Find my iPhone\" feature, I see that her account has 3 phones associated with it. The 3 phones are named:\n\n\n*\n\n*Iphone\n\n*Iphone\n\n*(Name)'s Iphone.\n\n\nHow can I know which is her current one? Her previous models are a iPhone 4S, an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 6. I don't see any place to check each phone's model.\n\nA: If you load the image of your device in \"Find My iPhone\" in a new tab, you are able to get the model identifier ID from the URL. As an example, here's the URL for an iPad that I lost quite a while ago:\nhttps://statici.icloud.com/fmipmobile/deviceImages-9.0/iPad/iPad2,1/locked-nolocation_ipad.png\n\nI wasn't sure whether this was an iPad 1 or 2, but the URL clearly shows that it's an iPad 2 (iPad2,1).\nSee this list of all Mac model identifiers, and this one for mobile devices.\n\nA: It's too late now to identify the iPhone.  This must be done prior to losing the device, when you're able to provide a name for it.  Find iPhone doesn't list the specific device.\nTo name the device, go to Settings -> General -> About and in the Name field enter a specific device name (for example, 'PaulJ's iPhone 5s').  Then, when you need to locate the device, it will get the name you entered and it can be identified.\nThe only thing you can do now is the process of elimination.  Figure out which of the 3 devices listed is not accounted for someplace or, perhaps, not turned on.  \n\nA: Out of curiosity I logged into my account to see if there was any way of differentiating.\nOther than the iPad and the Mac mini, they are remarkably difficult to tell apart. This is further compounded by the name issue. That said, in the below image, the top iPhone is a 7, the next one is a 5, the next one is a 5s, the next one is a 6, the one after that is a 5s, then a 5, and the one at the very bottom is a 6s.\nNote if they say offline and you tap on them, you get a bigger image. (If they're not offline, you get only a slightly bigger image.) You can also try using your browser's zoom function. Remember that the 6 series moved the sleep/wake button to the right side, so that may help.\n\n\n\nA: Thanks everybody for your answers. In the end, as usual, I found the answer in the most stupid way possible: I went to the \"Settings\" section in iCloud.com, and in \"My devices\", it shows the currently backed up devices. The iPhone that shows up there is the \"(name)'s iPhone\" one.\n(It hasn't appeared yet, though :-( ).\n", "Q: Open Images in Preview doesn't work in Automator (How to use Automator task to open screenshots in Preview automatically) I've read another post that seemed to address how to use Automator to open screenshots automatically. (Automator task to open screenshots in Preview automatically) I've followed the steps exactly, but the last step still doesn't work (opening the screenshot in Preview)\nSo, I'm stuck.  I really want the easiest solution to get Preview to open after I take an Interactive or Full Screenshot.  I thought this may be it but...\n\n\nA: After playing with it a little bit I couldn't get the process to work as listed in your screenshot, either. Here's a flow which works - in fact, it took the screenshot below. Note that you need to set this up as a service in order to assign it a keyboard shortcut. (Create a new Automator workflow and select Service as the document type.) Otherwise, if you save it as an app, you have to run the app every time you want to take a screenshot.\nOnce you have saved your workflow as a service, go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and select Services on the left-hand side, then scroll down on the right to find your service and set a keyboard shortcut.\n\n\nA: To address your comment, and the overall question, here is how I'd automate the whole process.\nI'd use the screencapture command line utility in a Run Shell Script action instead of using the Take Screenshot and Open Images in Preview actions. For more information about the screencapture command line utility read its manual page.\nThe example code produces a filename same as the default when using standard keyboard shortcuts while placing it on the Desktop.\ncd \"$HOME/Desktop\"\nscreenShot=\"Screen Shot $(date \"+%Y-%m-%d\") at $(date \"+%H.%M.%S\").png\"\nscreencapture -i -P \"$screenShot\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*cd \"$HOME/Desktop\" can be any valid location you'd like.\n\n*screenShot=\"Screen Shot $(date \"+%Y-%m-%d\") at $(date \"+%H.%M.%S\").png\" the screenShot variable forms the filename to be saved to. $(date \"+%Y-%m-%d\") will be e.g. 2016-10-06 and $(date \"+%H.%M.%S\") will be e.g 21.23.07 and the filename would then be, e.g.: Screen Shot 2016-10-07 at 21.23.07.png, just as if you used the default standard keyboard shortcuts.\n\n*screencapture -i -P \"$screenShot\", -i runs screencapture interactively, by selection or window. The control key will cause the screen shot to go to the clipboard. The space key will toggle between mouse selection and window selection modes. The escape key will cancel the interactive screen shot. -P Open the taken picture in a Preview window.\nNote that you can modify the options of the screencapture command if you want it to behave differently then the example code. Also, if pressing the control key, which places the screen shot on the Clipboard, it will not then be opened in Preview.\n\n\n", "Q: I'm about to sell my Mac. What should I delete? I'm looking to sell my Mac and because I am unable to format and make a fresh reinstall, I'd like to just delete sensitive files.\nWhat files or folders should I delete to be as safe as possible from leaving personal data on the disc?\n\nA: Everything. Delete all of your applications. Create a new user account with a generic name and password (like \"guest\"/\"guest\") and make that account an administrator. Log in with that account and then delete the home folder of your account. These two steps are the best way to get rid of the data. That being said, it is possible to recover this data if the person you are selling it to has malicious intent. Be careful with your data! Best way to be safe is to sell the computer without the hard drive (but that doesn't seem to be an option for what you want to do).\n\nA: Yes, you should delete all your info. As stated on https://macback.co.uk You should delete all of your personal information off of your device before you sell it.

In order to help people maybe gain a bit more insight, let me go into further detail.\nResearching the Internet for the error message, my first hunch was that it had something to do with permissions. Check a discussion on Reddit or on the Homebrew GitHub for reference. However, running sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local did not to the trick.

Checking in Users & Groups, shows that Account A is still Admin. Account B is not listed.\n4) Logging out of Account A returns to a screen with the option to log in again as either Account A or Guest.\n5) A restart brings us back to #1, where we have to sign in first as Account B, then Account A.\nAttempting to reinstall macOS from recovery mode prompts for the password from Account B (not the admin account) to unlock the HD.\nWhat is going on, and how can it be fixed?\n\nOriginal post:\nThe first time I restarted my macbook air after the latest macOS update, the primary user account had disappeared from the startup screen. My wife's account (a standard account which she never uses) and the guest account (which is apparently now a special browser only mode) are now the only options.\nAll attempts to login through my wife's account have failed. I figure she doesn't remember her password. I decided that I'm just going to try reinstalling the OS. So I restarted while pressing cmd-r to get into the recovery mode with macOS utilities and click to reinstall macOS.\nThen it gets weird... My password didn't work to unlock the HD, and based on the hint, the hard drive is now encrypted under my wife's password instead of the one from my (now disappeared) admin account.\nHow/why would the primary account seem to disappear? And how did it end up treating a non-admin account as admin (and encrypting the HD under that password)? Did it just default to whatever other account it could find when the primary one went away?\nAnd how can I get back in again? I imagine that all of the files are still there if I could access them.\nEdit: My wife managed to remember her password and typed it in from the login screen, but instead of logging her in, it started another startup screen, now with options to log in as the primary account (the one that was missing before) or guest account, but now her account is missing. If I log out, her account is still missing.\nBut when I restart, it goes back to only having her account and guest as options... Then when I attempt to log in as her, it again takes me to a start up screen where the option are my account and guest.\nWhat is going on here?

I’d like to back them up somewhere online, too, but I don’t use Apple’s photo-syncing offerings and I’d prefer not to turn them on just for this situation.)\n\nA: Apple's camera-connection hardware only interfaces with the Photos app, unfortunately. However, you should be able to transfer the photos from the photos app to Dropbox or a similar app after the import using the \"send to\" feature (I know it works with OneDrive and Google Drive).\n", "Q: How to stop iOS 10 alarm from silencing itself after 15 minutes? Since updating to iOS 10, my alarm clock (which is set to play an hour-long song) is silencing itself after 15 minutes. \nIt doesn't technically snooze itself, as the snooze button is still present on the lock screen after the music cuts. \nI've tried disabling the bedtime features, without help. \n\nA: The iOS 10 alarm clock will turn off after 15 minutes and there's nothing you can do about it, it's built that way.  Even if you turn off Snooze, it will still stop.\nIf you need something else, and it looks like you do, I recommend going to the SE Software Recommendation site and ask for other options.  I'm sure you're not the only one who needs alternatives because of this change.\n\nA: I just set an alarm for every 15 minutes that way it won’t shut off\n", "Q: How to install imgcat on iTerm2?

I used to use NoSleep on OS X El Capitan; unfortunately it stopped working properly after Yosemite and I've heard that on Sierra it causes problems, so I don't want to install it and potentially cause damage.\nDoes anyone use anything that they personally have used that prevents MacBooks from going to sleep when the lid is closed on macOS Sierra?\n\nA: UPDATE: 2022\nNoSleep works perfectly on macOS Monterey 12.4 on both Intel and M1 Macs. Get the latest release from Github\n\nOLD ANSWERS\nDon't try these on newer macOS's\n2020\nInsomniaX is not being mantained anymore & you SHOULD NOT use it. No sleep is a better option until MacOS Mojave. Haven't tested any of these with MacOS Catalina. If anyone has tested with Catalina, let us know in the comments.\n2016\nInsomniaX works perfectly on my MBP 13\" 2015. I am using macOS Sierra 10.12.\nThere's also an app called NoSleep, but it hasn't been updated in years, only use it if you're on older OSX like Mavericks or Yosemite.. I wouldn't recommend using it on Sierra..\n\nA: Amphetamine (Free, App Store)\nCurrently, the best option for modern macOS versions is Amphetamine. This is a free utility that can keep your screen awake, prevent your computer from sleeping when the lid is open, and prevent your laptop from sleeping when the lid is closed.\nThis is the best option over the other alternatives mentioned because:\n\n*\n\n*It is free\n\n*It is compatible with macOS versions back to 10.11 El Capitan, and likely will be updated for macOS Big Sur soon after it is released (not sure if it works already)\n\n*It is updated frequently\n\n*As for keeping your laptop awake with the lid closed, you may install an optional helper tool which \"adds a fail-safe for the closed-display mode,\" increasing the reliability of lid-close-sleep-prevention feature. The helper tool is also open source\n\n*It is readily available on the macOS App Store.\n\n\nA: Tested NoSleep 1.4.0 on my MacBook Air 2012 and it works with macOS High Sierra 10.13.0. Simply need to authorize the use of NoSleep kext in Security settings when warned during install.\n\nA: I actually still use NoSleep on my macbook air 2011 running on OSX Sierra and it seems to work fine still :) Haven't tried putting it on a brand new macbook pro 13 (2016) also running Sierra yet though. No sleep version 1.4.0.\n\nA: \"Anti Sleep\", an app in the App Store.\n\nA: Use Caffeinate\nTo begin running the caffeinate command and prevent your Mac from sleeping, open the Terminal located in /Applications/Utilities, then type the following command:\ncaffeinate\n\nWhile this command is running, you will be able to close the lid on your Mac and still have OS X and your apps running and performing their tasks just as you would if the lid were to remain open.\n\nA: One possibility is to completely disable sleep using sudo pmset disablesleep 1. However, after doing this you can't even manually issue the Sleep command from the Apple menu. Sleep mode becomes completely disabled.\nTo re-enable Sleep mode, use sudo pmset disablesleep 0.\n", "Q: Does macOS Sierra support multiple users simultaneously connecting to the same machine using screensharing? Apparently this was possible with Yosemite, but I've never actually seen it in action, and I don't know if it has gone the way of Target Display and other cool features they've thrown away.\n\nA: The feature still exists, yes. With some experimentation, I managed to understand the trick in knowing how to invoke that system.\nMy goals were to get a \"not mirrored\" remote desktop session going, in case I ever needed to work remotely for any reason.\nTL;DR - First \"screen sharing\" session is always mirrored; subsequent sessions will prompt \nHere are the steps to reproduce (though, not quite 100%, I noticed; unsure why):\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Server\" needs at least 2 users who are able to use Screen Sharing.\n\n*Have your \"Client\" launch screen sharing with the \"Dummy\" user.\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder -> \"Go\" menu -> Connect to server (Command+K)\n\n*Enter the credentials for dummy\n\n*This is the \"first screen sharing\" session, and will mirror the displays.\n\n\n*Have your \"Client\" establish a second connection the server using your \"Main\" user.\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen Sharing (application's name) Menu -> Connection -> New...\n\n*Enter the credentials for main_user\n\n*Dialog box should prompt \"Dummy is already logged in. Ask for permission to share the screen, or login as [main_user]?\"\n\n*Choose the \"login as [main_user]\" option.\n\n*This creates a \"secondary screen sharing\" session which will NOT be mirrored; it will be a virtual session.\n\n\n*Close the \"Dummy\" Screen Sharing window.\n\n*Close the \"Main\" Screen Sharing window.\n\n*Have your \"Client\" launch screen sharing with the \"Main\" user.\n\n\n*\n\n*Somehow, dummy will still have a session running and the system will once again prompt the \"ask permission? or just log in as yourself?\" questions.\n\n\n\nA: macOS Sierra still supports multiple simultaneous connected users. In the example below Sierra is running in a VM and admin is logged in. user is a remote screen sharing session from the VM host machine (10.9.5) – an iMac – and root is a remote session from a MacBook Pro (10.11.6):\n\n", "Q: MacOS 10.12 (Sierra) - Missing \"SystemCACertificates.keychain\" file I upgraded to Sierra today and it appears that the \"SystemCACertificates.keychain\" file no longer appears in Macintosh HD -> System -> Library - Keychains.\nAnyone know a workaround for this?  I use a smart-card to login to many sites and I no longer have access to 50% of those sites now.  I think this might be the root cause.\n\nA: This is currently being discussed here: Centrify LInk and it seems like many of us are in the same boat.  I found a link to the certificates:  SystemCACertificates from git site, and I am able to import it into my keychain.  However, the icon for the original SystemCACertificates is still in my keychain.  Also, I've notice that the most recent certificate in that SystemCACerts is CA30; my CAC card requires a CA32 certificate for validation.  Both of these issues may be to blame for why it doesn't work.  I'm planning on going back to 10.11. \n", "Q: Facetime call history & Facebook message history Do FaceTime calls show up on my phone bill???  Is there a way for me to find out if someone on my shared account is making and/or receiving FaceTime calls and, if so, to/from whom?  Basically, what I'm asking is if there is any way for me to find out if my husband is using FaceTime to talk to another woman?  Without actually taking his phone and snooping or using an app like FONEPAW?  What about messages sent thru Facebook?  Can those be accessed without his phone?\n\nA: FaceTime calls do not show-up as 'FaceTime' on your phone bill.  It's simply a data transfer so it will be lumped-in with all other data transfers on your bill, you don't know what type of data it was, either.\nFaceTime calls (audio and video) all go thru Apple's servers so they have a record of the calls.   Also, the iPhone stores the FaceTime history in a local database.  You can search this site for examples of software and techniques to get access to that database and look at it.  They all require you to jailbreak the iPhone so you'd need access to it for an extended period of time.\nFor Facebook, I believe you can search the history as long as it hasn't been deleted.  Here's an article on how to so that.  It's a few years old but I believe it's still technically correct.\n", "Q: Use Caps Lock to switch to and from languages on Sierra Sierra added this feature that allows you to switch from a to Latin layout from a non-Latin layout by Caps Lock. \nIt doesn't work with Russian, although last time I checked Russian was a non-Latin language. \nDoes anyone have any luck with working around this bug?\n\nA: To switch keyboard layout with caps-lock key you need to\nremap caps-lock to F18 with command (in Terminal.app):\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x700000039,\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x70000006D}]}'\n\nThen, go to System Preferences/Keyboard/Shortcuts/Input Sources, use key 'caps lock' to switch input source.\nNo additional software is required on mac os Sierra.\nTo keep this working after you logout do the following:\ncreate file ~/bin/caps2f18.sh with the following content:\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x700000039,\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x70000006D}]}' > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nMake it executable:\nchmod +x ~/bin/caps2f18.sh\n\nCreate file ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.loginscript.plist with the following content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n   <key>Label</key>\n   <string>com.user.loginscript</string>\n   <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n   <array>\n        <string>zsh</string>\n        <string>-c</string>\n        <string>~/bin/caps2f18.sh</string>\n   </array>\n   <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n   <true/>\n   <key>ThrottleInterval</key>\n   <integer>86400</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nExecute\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.loginscript.plist\n\nlogout login, or execute launchctl start com.user.loginscript\n\nA: My tests indicate that the Caps Lock switching feature now works with Cyrillic, Greek, and Armenian keyboards in High Sierra.  (These do not work in Sierra).\n\nA: Although both Seil and the classic Karabiner don't work anymore under Sierra, Karabiner rewrite, \"Karabiner Elements\" (in a very early beta) actually works.\nThe UI key mapping doesn't yet work, but you can edit the config json file under ~/.karabiner.d/configuration/karabiner.json (see an example below) to map Caps Lock to F19. From there it's all the same as before - disable Caps Lock, map keyboard layout triggering to F19, profit.\nExample karabiner.json:\n{  \"profiles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Default profile\",\n      \"selected\": true,\n      \"simple_modifications\": {\n        \"caps_lock\": \"f19\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nDowngrade deferred! \n\nA: To extend JBaruch's answer, this is a configuration for Karabiner to send Ctrl+Option+Space when CapsLock is clicked. This will switch the keyboard layout immediately - without delay of showing the list of available layouts.

One of them is breaking down. Since apple discontinued the thunderbolt display, are there other companies that can support daisy chaining a non apple monitor to an apple monitor. \nHere, here, and here all say no, but that was before the july 2016 discontinuation. Other forums say you can do this with DP 1.2, but the OS is incompatible. Again, these are old forums and I wanted to know if there is an update. \nI have a 2014 retina macbook pro for reference\n\nA: The short and simple answer is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directly?  No.  You cannot daisy chain a mDP display directly off a Thunderbolt\ndisplay.\n\n*Indirectly? Yes.  You can add a single mDP display off another Thunderbolt peripheral (like storage or a dock)\n\n\nThis is coming off of Apple's Support page as of the time of this answer:\n\n\n  \n*Can I connect my Mini DisplayPort monitor or monitor using a Mini DisplayPort adapter to my Apple Thunderbolt Display?\n  Mini DisplayPort Monitors or Monitors connecting with Mini DisplayPort adapters will not function when connected through a Thunderbolt Display. They must be connected directly to the Thunderbolt port on the computer or to a non-display device as indicated above.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\nA: The LG Thunderbolt display recommended in one answer is supported only for a specific range of Apple computers at restricted resolutions for many of them-check out compatibility of your Apple for the advertised LG above before you purchase. \nSpecifically addressing the question asked, Apple guidance for adding a monitor to a Thunderbolt Display chain off of 1 Thunderbolt port on the Mac (otherwise chain likely unnecessary) now says: \n\nConnect [your display] to a port on a Thunderbolt peripheral that's connected to your Mac … Connect your [Thunderbolt] display only at the end of the Thunderbolt chain. You can use only one Mini DisplayPort device in the Thunderbolt chain.\"\n\nIf Thunderbolt Display must come last the guidance implies that a 2 monitor chain could work: Apple computer w/Thunderbolt port ↔ Mini DisplayPort Display ↔ Thunderbolt Display. But I'm told by a PC technician that on the PC side daisy-chain adaptability has been dropped as a feature from monitors themselves as GPU and port options increase--so the chain could fail at the monitor regardless.\nTest before purchase: buying a Mac with more than 1 thunderbolt port is probably your best bet.\n\nA: http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34UM95-P-ultrawide-monitor\nI use it with an MBP, also. Never tried daisy-chaining. It's got DP, too, and USB 3.0. Also has a KVM switch and can handle multiple inputs concurrently (not ideal). It's almost too much monitor. I honestly feel like I need two chairs to use it because of the amount of real-estate & resolution. Easily replaces dual monitors of a decent size. It's VESA mountable & very light. Any old/cheap wall-mount will work. I've used one that looks like it's meant to hold up a light-bulb.\nThunderbolt\nThis monitor's Thunderbolt input/output port allows you to connect up to six compatible devices, moving data between them with incredible speed. The two channels of 10-gigabits-per-second throughput in both directions are up to 20X faster than USB 2.0. Thunderbolt is an exciting innovation for both expansion and premium video display.\nNote: When connecting both Thunderbolt™ ports to two separate computers, the monitor will only recognize the computer that is connected first. The second Thunderbolt™ port can be used as a daisy-chain for external storage devices or additional monitors.\nDon't pay retail! I picked one up when it first came out a year or two ago, and I got it for 10% off from Beach Audio in NY. And a friend of mine has sent me some links to advertisements when he's seen it selling significantly cheaper. You can probably find it for almost half the price, especially if you're patient (holiday season coming up = sales).\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Problems dowloading iphone-user-guide-for-ios-10 I recently upgraded my iPhone5, and want to download the iphone-user-guide-for-ios-10.\nI found in iTunes on my MacBook Pro running 10.12, and it shows \"Downloading\", but has been doing this for hours.

when my keyboard seemed to be sticky and slow. I could type three or four characters (or keys) before any appeared on the Facebook page as part of a comment that I was writing. Then \"parsecd\" popped up for approval from my \"Little Snitch\" app. I allowed it after reading the details. Now, knock on wood, there does not seem to be any stickiness or delays with my keyboard. This may be part of a patch as a result of recent updates from the Apple App Store, including MacOS Sierra. I also started using \"private browsing\" around the same time. In retrospect, private browsing seems to be related to the sticky keys as well. In addition, I had been changing my login password and then found that I was blocked from \"keychain access\" I learned that the best way to prevent this blockage is to change my login password only through . As the administrator, it seems I can change the password of any other user on this same Mac. But when I change the passwords for other users, the \"keychain access\" password for that user does not change. To effectively change the login password for any user, that user must be logged in, and to change it through  which then changes his \"keychain access\" password at the same time. This is only my opinion, which is offered as an observation. Any relationship to the actual problem may be purely coincidental.

With my limited understanding I haven't been able to figure out a way to do this. Can anyone help?\nHere's a run-down of my problem and my current approach: I'm doing some 3D rendering in Blender through the command line in Terminal, but having a persistent error. Blender renders each frame's image, but after usually 3 or 4 frames of animation rendering, the GPU bombs out and all the subsequent frames render black with a size of 28kB.\nMy brute force method of remedying this so I can render unattended:\n\n\n*\n\n*Blender is set to not overwrite existing files as it creates new frame renders\n\n*Automator Folder Action whenever a new frame is saved:\non run {input, parameters}\n-- ignoring application responses\ntell application \"Keyboard Maestro Engine\"\n    do script \"BA8776AB-5030-4753-85FB-0032D396B9B1\"\n    -- or: do script \"renderhack\"\nend tell\n-- end ignoring\n\nreturn input\n\nend run\n\n*This triggers a Keyboard Maestro macro which does the following:\n3a. Activates Terminal Window\n3b. Types Ctrl-C keystroke to kill Blender process (it's already started rendering next frame)\n3c. Executes a shell script to delete any small files i.e. \nfind  -name \"*.png\" -size -1M -delete\n(this is unnecessary for now but would be if I could solve my problem)\n3d. Reactivates Terminal Window\n3e. Types Up-arrow key, Return to relaunch blender in the Terminal.\nSo this does work, but I would love to find a more elegant solution, which would save a few more seconds every frame. If the folder action could work conditionally somehow, to only trigger the next script/macro if the most recent file is a certain size.\nI hope this makes sense. Unfortunately just moving small files out of the folder doesn't work, since Blender will keep rendering black frames. I need to trigger the above steps (or something like it that also includes killing Blender) when a small file appears in the folder.\n\nA: You can use Automator to create a folder action which filters Finder items like this:\nChoose \"Folder Action\" in the start screen of Automator and create a workflow similar to this one:\n\nSave it. The folder action will move all files smaller than 100 KB received in the folder \"sort\" to the Desktop folder.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use an Apple Time Capsule just as a network attached backup drive and not a router? Short Question : \nIs it possible to use an Apple Time Capsule just as a network attached backup drive and not a router? \nBackground : \nWe want to use a separate router to manage a more complex network. We where looking at not using an Apple Time Capsule and instead a 3rd party NAS (probably Synology) for Time Machine to backup to but as I've read in multiple places that backing up to a 3rd party NAS can cause the Time Machine backups to become corrupt / miss files due to the fact the HDD in a 3rd party NAS is ext4/NTFS/... and can't be OS X journaled (or what ever Time Machine prefers)\nWe've got a network as follows : \n\n\n*\n\n*TP-Link Gigabit Load Balance Router with VPN (we will also set VLANs, static IPs etc on here)\n\n*48 port Netgear gigabit network switch\n\n*multiple in wall RJ45 ports \n\n*4x Ubiquity UAP Wi-Fi access points (some indoor some outdoor)\n\n\nA: You should actually do BOTH of the things suggested by the other answers.\n\n*\n\n*Go into Wireless tab and set the mode to Off so that it doesn't create a WiFi network anymore.\n\n\n*Go into Network tab and set it to Off (Bridge Mode) so that it doesn't run a DHCP server/NAT anymore. Otherwise it will try to create its own subnet for any devices connected via its ports. Turning this off is very important, to avoid messing up your network with multiple layers of NAT etc (so don't listen to klanomath's comment on a previous answer).\n\n\n*Connect a network cable from your main router to the Time Capsule's WAN port (not the LAN ports). It's now a NAS (network attached storage).\nNow you have achieved the following:\n\n*\n\n*Your Time Capsule acts as a DHCP client and receives an IP address from your main router. You can reach it at that IP and connect to its network shared storage. I am connected to mine right now.\n\n\n*Any devices you connect to the Time Capsule's LAN ports will be routed \"straight through\" like a basic switch, WITHOUT any services/traffic modifications by the Time Capsule. The actual DHCP assignments and NAT etc for those devices will be handled by your main router (not the Time Capsule). So the Apple TC acts as a simple switch that passes through the ethernet traffic to the correct device.\nSo that's it. Just turn off the WiFi and the DHCP/NAT stuff and you're done. Your Time Capsule is now a basic router and a DHCP client which shares its own data folder. Done!\n\nA: Yes, you can simply disable routing on TimeCapsule and set it as DHCP client.\n\n\nA: Yes, this is possible and actually quite simple. To prevent the Time Capsule from acting as a WiFi access point or router, and use it only as a backup disk, just open the AirPort Utility app on a Mac (Applications -> Utilities -> AirPort Utility) and do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your Time Capsule and hit Edit.\n\n*Go to the tab labeled Wireless (not Network as zhovner suggests, as putting it in bridge mode only stops it from being a router but does not stop it from being a network access point that your devices will connect to)\n\n*From the Network Mode pop-up menu, choose Off.\n\n*Click Update, and the base station will restart and load the new settings.\n\n\nThe result will be a Time Capsule you can still wirelessly backup your Macs to, but does not function as a router or access points, so none of your devices will connect to it.\nThis is the setup that I use; I have 3 eero routers and thus needed the Time Capsule to not be an access point, and these steps stopped it from being that but let me keep backing up to it as usual.\n\nFrom this wireless tab, just choose off in the Network mode pop-up and hit update.\nSource is a Macworld article on the topic.\n", "Q: Why do some softwares have memory leak? Can anyone simply explain the reason of memory leaks? My Firefox seems to use up to 500Ms of memory though it is only for reading news Online. It seems that certain browsers use significantly less for the same pages viewed although I like how Firefox is mostly fast.\n\nA: Google and Bing are your friends.\nA Memory Leak is due to bad memory management of the application.  Basically, it allocates memory but fails to release it when finished.  Therefore, as the application continues to run, it keeps allocating free memory until there is no more.\nThe fact that certain browsers use more or less memory has nothing to do with there being a memory leak.  Chrome likes to have individual processes for each tab  or session (more memory) where Firefox does the opposite.  Memory is cheap now so there is less of a need to be efficient, but there is a need for higher performance.\nThe real issue is what to do about memory leaks - since most people don't reprogram and self-patch a program like FireFox - you can quit a program that has leaks or just log out. Mac OS (as well as most other operating systems) then release all the leaked memory and return it to the system pool. Leaks happen, so as an educated user you can watch for them and tend to leaky programs as opposed to letting them run continually.\n", "Q: Where is \"Create disk image\" function in El Capitan/Sierra?

According to Apple, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have an IP67 rating for dust and water-resistance. You can read more about how IP ratings work here.\nIn a nutshell, as far as water is concerned, an IP rating of 67 means the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus can be fully submerged in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes without being damaged.\nSo, will an iPhone 7 die if it takes a brief dip in water that’s deeper than 1 metre? No. \nWill it survive for over a half hour or so in about 5cm (2\") of water? Yes. \nWhat this all means is that an iPhone 7 will survive a water accident.  \nAs for protecting the Lightning port from water, while I haven't personally seen inside an iPhone 7 yet, what I can tell you is how smartphone manufacturers make their USB and headphone ports water resistant.\nTypically, they seal all parts that could let water in. This means the SIM card tray has a built-in rubber seal to stop moisture getting inside the smartphone, as do external buttons, MicroUSB or Lightning ports and 3.5mm headphone jacks.\nThe charging and headphone ports are also fixed in place in a way that very tightly presses them up against the inside of the frame. \nAnother area of vulnerability are speakers. Air and audio need to pass through the speaker to outside of the frame, but the ‘grille’ needs to prevent water from getting in. Typically manufacturers use a screen made from an incredibly tight mesh that prevents water getting through without external force.\nThat's why smart watches aren't usually water resistant to 50m (not even Samsung's latest offering!). The Apple Watch 2 achieves this amazing feat by using the speakers themselves to eject the water. No doubt other manufacturers will copy this process.\nFinally, as a point of interest, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were also designed to be water resistant (although not officially). I've seen inside these and the difference compared to earlier models is obvious. You can read more about this here.\n[EDIT]\nThis edit addresses the issue raised by Adam Rice in their comment, namely that my original answer didn't cover the issue of what prevents water inside the charging port from damaging an iPhone 7 by conducting electricity between its connectors?\nAs I mentioned in my original answer, rubber seals are used to stop moisture getting inside the smartphone via the sim tray, external buttons, charging ports, etc. However, what I forgot to mention is that these phones have a moisture sensor in the charging port that protects the phone from electrical short circuits and damage. This basically means that the phone will not accept a charge if the sensors detect moisture. Likewise, electrical current between the connectors is also prevented if moisture is detected by the sensors.\nAlso, it is worth noting that having a water-resistant smartphone is a bit like having a diver's watch that is water-resistant to 200m. The instructions of such watches tell you not to press any of the buttons while it's under water. Likewise, with a smartphone, don't plug it in to a power source while it's under water.\n", "Q: Let Finder display files with a user-defined extension I have defined myself a file extension .ev, they are actually text files, which can be opened by TextEdit.\nIn Finder, by Column view, a .txt document can be displayed directly on the right hand side.

I have many gigabytes of old iOS applications on the computer, which originate from my iPhone/iPad that are synced to the computer.\nThese applications are visible in the main roll-down menu in iTunes 12.5.1 under Apps, and on the macOS hard drive in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications as .ipa files.\nI know that iOS apps that are still available in the App Store can be re-downloaded if they've once been purchased (free or not), but that withdrawn apps can only be restored from the aforementioned iTunes library.\nI do not care about keeping backups of apps I don't actively use – and I don't keep on the devices any old apps withdrawn from the App store – so I would like to delete everything and then restore apps that I currently use on my iOS devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the best way to delete all the applications and then restore them? If I delete them in iTunes, will syncing my iOS devices recreate the currently used applications again?\n\n*If so, is that done by backing up the application from the device, or downloading it onto the computer from the iTunes \"app\" store – thereby not backing up the app data itself (assumingly, this is something that is done within the iOS device backup in iTunes, not in the App tab)?\n\nNote: The question is not about how to delete Mobile applications (this can be done by right-clicking the apps in the roll-down App view in iTunes, but not under the App tab under the iOS device view). The question is about how to purge unnecessary Mobile Applications from the Mac.\n\nA: Apparently (based on a comment on my answer in the question you linked), syncing a device with iTunes no longer transfers purchased apps from the device to the computer.\nThere is no automatic way to \"restore\" all apps that you want into your iTunes library. Each one would need to be re-downloaded through iTunes. From the Apps section of iTunes, if you go to the App Store tab, there is a Purchased link on the right-hand side a few items down. From there just click on the cloud with the down arrow in the corner of the icon for each app you want to re-download. you can sort that list alphabetically using the Sort drop-down toward the upper-right.\nI don't know if there's an easy way to get a complete, alphabetical list of all 3rd-party applications installed on your device. Settings > Cellular will show you a list, but I don't know if it's complete. (I think it should be, though.) Settings > scrolling down past Apple settings will show you a list, but I believe it's only apps that have permission requests built-in, or something exposed for the settings app; I don't believe it's everything. Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Storage > Manage Storage will definitely show you a complete list, but it's not alphabetized. \nYou are correct that, even when apps were copied from the device to the computer, user data was not included as part of that. Data from apps is only copied when making a backup.\n", "Q: How to have both Swift 2 and Swift 3 books in iBooks library I'm a professional software developer who is still supporting clients using Swift 2. However, I'd like to be getting up to speed on Swift 3 since clearly it is the wave of the future.\nMy copy of iBooks (on my Mac, dunno about my iOS devices) is currently the Swift 2 book, and when I go to the bookstore, it shows the Swift 3 version with a read button. When I click that it opens the Swift 2 book.\nI see from another question that I can right-click on my Swift 2 book in iBooks, delete it, and then re-download from the app store in order to update to the Swift 3 book.\nHowever, I need both versions to show up in my library, clearly named, and need to be able to open one or the other at will. \nHow do I accomplish this?\n\nA: I’m not sure iBooks offers an easy way to keep two versions of the same book from the iBooks Store around.\nYou could instead add the old version as an ePub or PDF copy. Apple makes the Swift documentation available as an ePub on swift.org. That site only seems to have the latest version, but copies of the older versions can be found around the web. Here's one for example: “The Swift Programming Language, Swift 2.2 Edition, Prerelease”.\nThere’s also a blog post on “Converting the Swift Programming Language to PDF” which offers these instructions for converting the iBooks Store file to a PDF yourself:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books.\n  \n*Once there, locate the 881256329 epub folder. You must use a non-beta version of the book. Beta versions are DRM’ed. If your version appears to be DRM’ed (a holdover from the beta period), delete it in iBooks and re-download.\n  \n*Copy this epub folder to your desktop. Remove the epub extension, zip it, rename to epub. Apple uses a non-standard epub format, and these steps transform the book back to something Calibre can import and convert.\n  \n*Drag this epub into Calibre.\n  \n*Click Convert books, choose PDF.\n  \n*In Page Setup, select default output profile, set margins to 72 on each side\n  \n*In PDF Output, add printable TOC.\n  \n*Click OK and let the conversion start\n  \n\n", "Q: Cannot restore live photo back to camera roll Since iPhone 6S, Apple introduced \"live photo\" for taking a picture with a short 3 second clips.

I'm switching between them using cmd+space. When in English, I'm using the caps lock to write uppercase letters. That's the exactly same behavior as any other English keyboard user.\nHowever, when using Hebrew as the input source, I'm using caps lock to write in english (small letters only). In this way, I can use some english terms in my hebrew sentences (which is quietly common, to be honest).\nThis is the behavior in Windows too.\nSince Sierra: Apple disabled this function, so when I'm using Englis I can use caps lock to move between uppercase and lowercase as excepted. However, when in Hebrew - the caps lock does not work (the green light automatically turns off).\nI'll note that when Googling this issue, I saw that Apple added the ability to switch languages using the caps lock. That solution does allows me to switch between Hebrew and English, but it rises another problem - In English, I can't switch between uppercase and lowercase letters (since the caps lock already mapped to switch between input sources). The only way to get into uppercase letters, is to hold the caps lock for 3 seconds, and that makes it very hard to type.\nAnyone knows how to restore the functionality of the caps lock to the old, good, way?\n\nA: I have verified that if you use Ukelele to create a duplicate Hebrew keyboard layout (with a different name of course), Caps Lock will function on it like it does in El Capitan.\n", "Q: Two Apple IDs on one iPad Is there a way for both my husband and I to have our information (apps, photos, etc) on one iPad?  He's the original owner and now I have my own iPhone, but I want to be able to do the same things he does, but on separate accounts with one iPad.\n\nA: In general, what you are suggesting is a Bad Idea™.\niOS devices such as iPad and iPhone do not have user accounts as you would have on a computer, where each user's data is stored separately and switching between accounts shows your data/apps/photos/etc. versus his. Simply signing in and out of an Apple ID on a device is not only time-consuming (to cover everything, there are at least 4-5 places I can think of off the top of my head where you'd have to log him out and you in, or vice-versa) but it's will wreak havoc with lots of things.\nIf you use iCloud calendars, they will either be deleted from the device each time you sign out, or if they are left, will be merged with the calendars of the next person who signs in. Notes stored in iCloud would be the same way. Calendars and notes don't necessarily take a huge amount of data, so maybe deleting them each time isn't that big a deal. What does take a lot of data is photos. If you use iCloud Photo Library, signing out will either delete all photos on the device (and therefore have to be re-downloaded each time you sign in), or if left, will be merged with the iCloud Photo Library of the next person to sign in (and eventually you'll end up with identical photo libraries).\nIf you use other systems for Calendars, Notes, and Email, such as Gmail, your stuff won't be accessible by just signing in and out of an Apple ID - you'd have to remove his account(s) and add yours, or vice-versa. That will cause all such data on the device to be deleted and have to be re-downloaded every time.\nApps do not get deleted by signing in and out, but by the same token, apps don't get downloaded just because you sign in. You can have apps purchased with different Apple IDs on the same device, but to update them, you have to be signed in with the ID that purchased them, which can create a headache. Also, app data, such as your progress in a game, does not go anywhere just by signing in and out. For games which don't have multiple save files (i.e. the majority of them), only one of you can save your progress. For other apps which contains data specific to one of you, the same idea applies.\nThe specific setting I mentioned in my comments requires signing in and out of iCloud, which I didn't think about when I mentioned it before. As mentioned above about calendars, notes, email, photos, etc. it would actually cause a lot of problems.\nIn short, no, it's not possible.\n", "Q: iOS QR code scanner that can open URLs in the default browser I am in search for an iOS app that can open URLs in the default browser upon reading a QR-code.

So basically, is there maybe some keywords to use to find these apps?\nIs it technically possible on iOS for other apps to open up other apps, such as, in this case, the web browser?\n\nA: If the native QR code scanner in control center and the camera app aren’t sufficient, I use https://qrafter.com for this on iOS.

It's the sgr0 reset command that's likely doing more than you want it to do and screwing up buffered text movements.\nLet's try doing this with ANSI codes directly. If you use an ANSI color scheme setup like this you can try:\nexport PS1=\"${normal}${bold_blue}\\t [\\W]${normal}: \"\n\nThat works perfectly for me with Fn-arrow combinations for navigating the line.\ntput is a neat idea, but it comes from the ncurses package which is a very advanced way of doing UIs in command prompt interfaces by exploiting all kinds of terminal stuff.

What I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the Ringtone in the FaceTime app on my iMac (set it to None under Preferences in OS X El Capitan, or disable Sounds for FaceTime under  → System Preferences → Notifications in macOS Sierra)\n\n*Assign a blank Ringtone on my iPad (set this in the Settings app under Sounds—this requires creating or downloading a custom ringtone)\n\n*Disable Sound for the Phone app on my WATCH (from the Watch app on your iPhone)\n\n\nMy reasoning is that the only times I'm going to pick up a call on any device other than my iPhone is when I'm already using my iMac or iPad, but not carrying my iPhone with me. In those cases, the onscreen notification is sufficient. It's very rare that I'm near my iMac/iPad and not using either of them, yet too far from my iPhone to hear it ring. Those rare cases do not seem to fall under your use case.\nThis is not a perfect solution, but at least it will keep you from being bothered by ringtones that keep going off while you're already answering the call. The WATCH might keep tapping you for a second, but that isn't nearly as distracting when you're trying to talk to someone.\n\nA: On the iPhone - in the settings app - Phone section, turn off Calls on Other Devices. That turns off calls and SMS to other linked devices.\nIf you want to re-enable one device or two, you can then toggle them on piecemeal until you find the configuration that works best for you and also know how to change it going forward instead of just enabling it everywhere on all the devices.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install MacOS Sierra or El Capitan on an external hard drive and boot it from a PC? I tried it out in Virtual Machine, but it was quite slow, and I don't want to risk losing my Windows by trying to install besides it.\n\nA: For what you want - Xcode - a used Mac mini or used laptop with a broken screen that you screen share/ssh in to seems far better than trying to dual boot and mess with hackintosh. \nYou can usually sell a used MacMini for almost what you paid for it, so the cost for three months of getting started is the interest on $400 expense. Used laptops that work and have broken screens or batteries that hold no charge are more in the $85 to $200 range.\nIt is possible to boot OS X on generic hardware, but this site isn't the place to ask that specifically - but solving your broader problem of developing Xcode and running a PC primarily is certainly worth a quality answer here with options.\n\nA: A PC in general can not run under any macOS (fka OSX).\nWhat specific application do you have in mind or do you just wanna have peek ;-)?\n", "Q: How is there storage when I haven't signed in yet? Just reset phone Lots of problems with my iPhone. iTunes music skips like messed up cd, websites timeout, some apps click to download but they do nothing. Restrictions are off. Factory reset phone and I wasn't allowed to create a new Apple ID but before signing in my iCloud storage already showed 1.99 GB being used. I set up as new phone and not logged in any account prior to this. Hmmm. Any help?\n   \n\nA: Each of the apps you installed is taking up part of the 1.99 GB storage.\nEven if you erase all content and settings - the OS and some baseline storage is used so you don't ever get 64 gb of available space.\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the practical difference between a 16GB and 32GB iPhone?\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/71313/5472\n", "Q: iPhone scam message - did not open picture but pressed preview I have made a mistake tonight. I received a picture message, saying \"free picture message - click to open'. I did not click the link in the message, but I did click \"preview\". Nothing happened on my phone afterwards and I didn't get taken to any websites (or Safari).\nI Googled the phone number that sent me the message afterwards and realised the message was from spammers. I am asking if anybody knows what it means to \"preview\" the message on an iPhone - has it downloaded it to your phone? \nAny help would be gratefully received - thank you. \n\nA: If you see it on your screen, it has been downloaded (would be difficult to show something which has not been downloaded). It doesn't matter whether you just preview something or open it in an app, technically there is no real difference. \nThe question behind the question probably is \"should I worry?\". Nobody can say for sure without much more information about the specific content, but most probably \"no, not all all\". \n", "Q: Apple Mail keeps crashing after Sierra update After updating to Sierra, directly after. The Mac Mail keeps crashing. I am trying to send an email and poof it crashes. It crashes randomly as well.

(if iCloud is crashing - set up gmail first, etc.) It's less likely the crash is app related and it might be more due to the settings files being corrupt or the actual mail data that is drawn on screen being corrupt.\n\nA: I started getting this same crash. \nFixed it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed my Gmail account using the Internet Accounts Settings panel (in System Preferences).\n\n*Mail now no longer crashing. \n\n*Go back into Mail and add back my Gmail account.\n\n", "Q: Delete Messages app I have downloaded an app for Messages, and I'm wondering how to delete it.\nI don't see it on the iPhone.\n\nA: If it's an app that's ONLY for Messages (meaning there's no supporting app that is accessible from outside Messages), you uninstall it by going into Messages, taping the A application icon, tapping the four bubbles in the bottom left corner, then swiping through pages until you find it. Press and hold on the app's icon and an X will appear. Tap the X to uninstall it.\nIf it's part of a larger iPhone app, for example a game that includes stickers, you would delete it by deleting the iPhone app itself.\n", "Q: chatty \"switching to keychain-db\" console messages in Sierra In macOS Sierra I'm noticing a very \"chatty\" and repetitive series of warnings in the console, like this:\ndefault 15:27:23.330990 -0700   AppleIDAuthAgent    switching to keychain-db: /Users/XYZ/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db from /Users/XYZ/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db (0 1 1 1)\n\nwhere dozens of processes are all logging the same \"switching to keychain-db\" message over and over again. These messages are coming from AppleIDAuthAgent, authd, secinitd, lcd, Finder, gamed, Mail, cloudd, and on and on.\nNot only that, but notice in the log message it's switching from and to the exact same file and path. The entire thing makes no sense.  Anyone know what this is all about?\n(Edit: As of March 2018, I'm now running High Sierra 10.13.3 and no longer are these messages appearing in my console.)\n\nA: I wouldn't worry about chatty messages in general as the logging subsystem is now database driven and can handle thousands of messages a minute with little or no load on the system.\nYou can get a nice overview of your log statistics and see if this is truly one of the larger users of logging. This command does take a while to chew throat the 30 million events I have on my MacBook (3 to 5 minutes) - but even that is a trivial load on my system in practice given how optimized and power efficient Apple macOS logging is now.\nlog stats --overview\n== archive =============================================================\nsize:               571,895,056 bytes\n                    2,118,164,524 bytes (uncompressed)\nstart:              Tue Aug  1 06:33:03 2017\nend:                Wed Sep 20 04:54:41 2017\nstatedump:          7,343\n\nevents:             [       total        log      trace   signpost ]\n                    [  30,724,811 27,173,212        996    409,431 ]\n\nactivity:           [      create transition     action ]\n                    [   3,132,338          0        201 ]\n\nlog messages:       [     default       info      debug      error      fault ]\n                    [  26,698,888    667,559     38,352    143,035     35,805 ]\n\nttl:                [        1day      3days      7days     14days     30days ]\n                    [     409,447 26,551,227    259,646    204,137    166,525 ]\n\nprocesses:          \n          [        events (%total),  decomp. bytes (%total),                           image UUID, image ]\n          [    14,796,212 ( 48.2%),    983,897,959 ( 46.5%), EA3CE30B-81E9-3DEA-95F3-CDACA642C5BD, kernel ]\n          [       396,296 (  1.3%),    133,190,047 (  6.3%), 5AA6AB96-6A89-3E62-9BB4-6CA2913647C9, secd ]\n          [       664,086 (  2.2%),     75,896,057 (  3.6%), 99B2EC04-B281-3EBF-8541-6F6FC3273D9C, identityservicesd ]\n          [       299,166 (  1.0%),     60,314,374 (  2.8%), 83FF3BD0-0A23-3232-A28A-C1A5297DA516, dasd ]\n          [       727,099 (  2.4%),     53,298,516 (  2.5%), 15049F04-4C48-3D01-ABC2-8DC751F0B9E3, cloudd ]\n\nsenders:            \n          [        events (%total),  decomp. bytes (%total),                           image UUID, image ]\n          [    13,883,766 ( 45.2%),    943,025,476 ( 44.5%), 0086A982-E384-3ABF-AD20-BF1300E02E42, Sandbox ]\n          [       394,150 (  1.3%),    133,130,846 (  6.3%), 5AA6AB96-6A89-3E62-9BB4-6CA2913647C9, secd ]\n          [     1,653,215 (  5.4%),     67,618,576 (  3.2%), D7DDB735-A244-3A06-A432-135E9E368B51, CFNetwork ]\n          [       294,803 (  1.0%),     60,187,838 (  2.8%), 7DC1094C-EF1A-3621-9A6B-DEDF467D64DF, DuetActivitySchedulerDaemon ]\n          [       393,191 (  1.3%),     58,538,606 (  2.8%), 99B2EC04-B281-3EBF-8541-6F6FC3273D9C, identityservicesd ]\n\nFor context - this machine runs beta software often - gets beat up in all manner of ways, Xcode, buggy apps, beta versions of Microsoft Office, beta OS with enhanced logging profiles.\n", "Q: How to force stop all the processing in the background (and map that command to a keyboard shortcut) My Mac has been having a lot of issues lately. Most of them have to do with lagginess and the spinning beach ball appearing quite often, and staying there for a long time. If my Mac is so slow, there must be some processing going on in the background that's using up all of the resources. Is there a way to \"kill\" all that processing going on in the background? If so, how do I map the command to a key combination? (Because when my Mac is hanging up, I can't open up the Activity Monitor. Yes, the lag is that bad! Even when I manage to open it up, it says I don't have permission to use it.)\n\nA: Force killing background processes isn't wise nor advisable. Some processes are very important to the OS's function, like kernel_task, WindowServer, CoreServicesUIAgent, etc. It's hard to distinguish between essential and non-essential processes if you try to \"insta-kill\" lag via a key combination.\nI fixed the issue by moving the mouse around a lot while I watch YouTube videos in Safari. I don't know why, but it doesn't freeze when I do that.\nI also got a new computer, so that solves the problem too.\n", "Q: How do spam email accounts get onto devices? My mom recently asked me about an email inbox on her phone called \"My Weather\". She didn't know what it was or how it got on the phone. It had 200+ emails in it and all were product or service offers from obscure websites. Basically just spam. Although, amusingly, there were new emails every day with a weather forecast. Funny. Anyway I checked email settings on the phone and there was an email account that was not my mom's with an address that went something like \"FirstnameLastname157@minbox.email\". There was no option to delete it like a normal account so I looked up minbox.email and found an Apple discussion forum on it. While this explains how to delete it, I want to know how it got on the phone in the first place, and what exactly it is. It must have been from a link in Safari or an email that opened something in Safari. I didn't think this was possible on iOS or any mobile device. I found very little information when searching for it. Maybe if I checked the next few Google pages... But you would think something like this would be a popular topic on forums. I did find this website which seems very suspicious: https://minbox.com/ Although this website asks you to enter an email address and it looks very poorly made, it's not definitive evidence that that's where the software came from. \nIf anyone has any information about this it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Check http:// minbox.email/join#/ (not linking them here though, don't want to generate traffic to their site); they offer a free email inbox in exchange of receiving spam. As of how they configure the email account on your device, it appears that it is made through a Configuration Profile.\nI tried to verify myself by creating an email but couldn't end the process because of an error on their end.\nYou or anyone can create a configuration profile to\n\n(...)quickly distribute groups of settings and access powerful\n  management features that aren’t normally available.\n\nThen \n\nYou could email the configuration profile to someone–including\n  yourself–or offer it for download on a website. When someone taps the\n  email attachment in the Mail app or downloads the configuration\n  profile file from a website, they’ll be prompted to install it on\n  their iPhone or iPad.\n\n(from this article).\nNote that your mother would have had to accept the prompt in order to apply the Configuration Profile.\nIt's also important to understand that this may be a vehicle for malicious configurations as explained in this article.\n", "Q: Is it possible to password protect access to a folder with your macOS password?

I've configured BetterTouchTool to allow me to toggle read/unread status of an email when I press ⌥/ (option slash, a convenient shortcut near the arrow keys), using the \"Trigger menu bar menu item\" action.  (See below screenshot.)\n\nThe shortcut works—when I trigger it, the read/unread status changes.  (BTT is smooth as glass, I LOVE it.)\nHowever, Mail.app also makes an audible and visual bell (screen flash and a sound) when I trigger the shortcut.  It does this whether or not BTT is running or configured.\nIs there some way I can suppress this bell sound and flash for this particular keyboard shortcut for Mail?\n(I'm running Mail 9.3 on macOS 10.11.6, and BetterTouchTool 1.912 (523).)\n\nP.S.: I tried several other unbound keyboard shortcuts, without configuring them in BTT but just pressing them in Mail, and all made the same flash and sound.

I'm hoping someone else has something better.\n\nP.S.: Using El Capitan 10.11.6.\n\nA: The only possible \"solution\" I have (which isn't really a solution but it's what I will do if nothing better is suggested), is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take everyone I don't routinely contact, export their vCards individually (not in batches) (this is so that quicklook will work), and delete them from Address Book (a.k.a.

But I'd prefer nested contact groups directly in Contacts.app.\n", "Q: Recover Corrupt SSHD I had an old 2011 13\" MPB with a 250 GB Samsung Evo 840 SSD and, using the OWC expansion bay mod, a 1 TB Seagate SSHD. The SSD was the boot drive and the SSHD was just for Time Machine backups, file storage, and a boot camp partition. Unfortunately, I spilled water on that Mac and it subsequently died. Yesterday I finally got around to getting a new Mac. I now have a 2013 15\" Retina model with 500 GB flash storage. I used Migration Assistant to transfer all my files from the SSD as it was the boot drive and the drive with my user account on it.

This will fail because the primary header of the disk(512) is in block(512) 1 and the primary table starts at block(512) 2.\nIt's obvious that you can't rewrite a GPT(512) to a GPT(4096) because the last block of the GPT(4096) table would overlap the first useable block of the GPT(512) disk.\n\nTry the following to restore the GUID partition table:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app and enter the following commands to get an overview and fundamental data to recover previous partition tables if the following commands fail:\ndisktutil list\ndiskutil info diskX | grep \"Device Block Size\" # with diskX: the disk identifier of the SSHD\n\nIf the command returns: Device Block Size:   512 Bytes continue, if 4096 Bytes are reported stop here and get a 512 Byte-capable external case:\nsudo gpt -r show diskX # with diskX: the disk identifier of the SSHD\nsudo fdisk /dev/diskX # with diskX: the disk identifier of the SSHD\n\nIn your case diskX: disk2\n\n*Unmount the external disk (just to be sure that it is unmounted). Below I assume diskX is disk2:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\nsudo gpt destroy disk2\nsudo gpt create -f disk2\n\nNow enter sudo gpt -r show disk2 if a new GUID partition table was created. It should look like this:\n       start         size  index  contents\n            0            1         PMBR\n            1            1         Pri GPT header\n            2           32         Pri GPT table\n           34   1953525102\n   1953525135           32         Sec GPT table\n   1953525167            1         Sec GPT header\n\nIf you get an error or no GUID pt was created you have to force-destroy the MBR:\nsudo if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=512 count=1\n\nThe command directly overwrites the first block of disk2 (the MBR of the disk) with zeros. If entered wrong (e.g without the \"count=1\" or the wrong disk identifer), it overwrites the whole disk. The command above should completed after milliseconds. If not, enter ctrlC to stop the command immediately.\nThen repeat:\nsudo gpt create -f disk2\n\nRecheck if it was successful now.\n\n*Add the partition one by one in the GUID partition table with gpt:\nTo add an partition with gpt use the following command\nsudo gpt -i index_number -b first_block -s size -t partiton_type diskX\n\nwith index_number: ~the partition number; first_block and size in blocks (either 512 or 4096 blocks) and partiton_type: a special GUID \nIn your case that's:\nsudo gpt -i 1 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk2\nsudo gpt -i 2 409640 -s 1175509584 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk2\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\nsudo gpt -i 3 1176181368 -s 292707720 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk2\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\nsudo gpt -i 4 1469151232 -s 484372480 -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 disk2\n\n\n*Now the \"lost\" volumes should reappear. Check the disk and the volumes with diskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk2, diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk2s2 and  diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk2s3.\n\n*Repair everything if necessary - but report back before starting the repair.\n\n\n\nIf you don't have an external case(512) but a second empty disk with at least 1 TB you should be able to recover each partition on disk2 by dd'ing each to a separate file (e.g sudo dd if=dev/disk2 of=/Volumes/Disk3/efi.rawdevice bs=512 skip=40 count=409600 to copy the EFI partition) on the empty disk. After dd'ing all four partitions to an external volume, repartition disk2 properly and restore  each of the four rawdevice files to its \"new\" partition.\n\nThe command gpt usually only writes to the first 34 and last 33 blocks and fdisk only to the first block on a disk with a block size of 512 Bytes. This will not destroy or modify your data. So everything you do is reversible.\n", "Q: RStudio Server Initialization Error on Mac El Capitan I have installed RStudio Server using Homebrew on a Mac Pro Server with El Capitan.

Sometimes I find from searching Google that I can reset the SMC, PRAM and NVRAM. But different sources provide different instructions on how to do this.  I have a MacBook Pro and iMac. I also have an iPad Mini and an iPhone 5c and wonder how these can also be reset if needed.\nCan someone please clear this up for me, or send me links to some info I can trust. \n\nA: From Apple KB: Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac\n\nReset the SMC on Mac notebook computers\nFirst determine whether the battery is removable. Mac notebook\n  computers that have a nonremovable battery include MacBook Pro (Early\n  2009) and later, all models of MacBook Air, MacBook (Late 2009), and\n  MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015). Learn more about Mac notebook\n  batteries.\nIf the battery is nonremovable \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down the Mac.\n  \n*Plug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your Mac.\n  \n*Using the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time.\n  \n*Release all keys, then press the power button again to turn on your Mac\n  \n  \n  If the battery is removable\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down the Mac.\n  \n*Disconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the Mac.\n  \n*Remove the battery. (Learn about removing the battery in MacBook and MacBook Pro computers.)\n  \n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds.\n  \n*Reconnect the battery and MagSafe power adapter.\n  \n*Press the power button to turn on the Mac.\n  \n  \n  The LED on MagSafe power adapters might change states or temporarily\n  turn off when you reset the SMC.\nReset the SMC on Mac desktop computers\nFollow these steps for iMac, Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Xserve.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down the Mac.\n  \n*Unplug the power cord.\n  1.Wait 15 seconds.\n  \n*Plug the power cord back in.\n  \n*Wait 5 seconds, then press the power button to turn on the Mac.\n  \n  \n  For Intel-based Xserve computers that aren't responding, you can shut\n  down locally or by using remote commands. You can also shut down by\n  pressing and holding the power button for 5 seconds.\n\niOS devices don't have an SMC.\n\nA: Sorry to hear you’re having problems. I hope the following clarifies things for you, but if these instructions do not help, you can always post specific questions about any problems you’re having.\nSMC\nThe reason for your confusion is that the instructions for resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) will differ depending on whether your device:\n\n\n*\n\n*runs from a built-in battery?\n\n*runs from a removable battery? \n\n*can only run from power off a wall socket?\n\n\nBelow I will provide the instructions for all three possibilities.\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (or power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nFor iMacs, Mac Pros, Mac Minis, etc that only run from a power point in the wall\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Unplug it from power\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds\n\n*Plug it back in and turn it on.\n\n\nPRAM/NVRAM\nNow, the reason for your confusion about PRAM and NVRAM is that older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). \nUntil recently, the instructions for resetting this were the same regardless of your Mac model. However, the Late-2016 MacBook Pro models use a different process. Below are the steps for both scenarios.\nResetting the PRAM/NVRAM on all models EXCEPT for Late-2016 MacBook Pro models\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models\nFor all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\niPods, iPhones, iPads\nDevices running iOS do not have an SMC or PRAM/NVRAM that you can reset like you do on Apple Macs.\nHowever, most random issues can be resolved by rebooting your device. To do this, hold down the Power button and Home button simultaneously for about 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo appear. After your device reboots you may need to enter your passcode.\nIn more serious cases, you can also access a range of reset options from Settings > General > Reset. Be careful though when deciding if/which option to select.\n", "Q: How to prevent iPhone from auto-connecting to unknown Wi-Fi? One thing I never do is to connect to foreign Wi-Fis. But my iPhone decides to automatically connect to those.\n\nTranslated:\n\nWelcome to the Telekom HotSpot (german network provider). You are connected to the internet via your SIM over Wi-Fi and are using your HotSpot flatrate. There will be no additional cost.\n\nUnfortunately I've seen the message half an hour later so I assume I already sent data via a foreign Wi-Fi in the background. How do I stop the phone from connecting to new, for me unknown wifis, without turning Wi-Fi off completly? Is this a general 'feature' or only in branded iPhones?\n\nA: iPhone will only auto-join networks that are set to be joined automatically — it won't connect to any random network. SSIDs can be set to auto-join by being manually connected to in Settings → Wi-Fi in the past (the default is auto-join and you can tap the ⓘ to disable auto-join) or because of a profile installed on the device potentially by your carrier or workplace (accessed through Settings → General → Profiles).\nYou also might need to clean out the check mark to remember networks if you sync settings over iCloud. When one device remembers a network - it will sync to all devices and computers.\n", "Q: is it possible on a mac to quicky see the desktop along with the last active window?

If you are seeing a piece of the desktop at that moment, then no problems, just drag the pic to that spot but, many times, it turns out that the entire desktop is covered by underlying other windows. Sure, there is a hot-corner trick you can apply that will get you the desktop, but that action will also take down the current window, the one you wanted to drag the picture from. \nAs far as I know, there is no way around this problem. \nSo I end up minimizing the underlying windows to get a piece of the desktop to drag picture onto.\nBut I'll ask it anyway... \nIs there a way that would do what I'd like to do?\n\nA: Simplest is in the Dock - \nHold  Alt ⌥  & Right Click > Hide Others\n\nAlternatively & probably better than my original answer [I don't know if this is system-wide, but it does appear in all the apps I checked, Apple & 3rd party]\n Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   H  is the key command to Hide Others\n\n\nA: You can use Hot Corner while you are dragging the picture to get to the Desktop. \nYou can also hit ^ CTRL+↓ DOWN ARROW to show the Desktop while dragging the picture.\nYou can also perform fingers spread gesture on the trackpad while dragging the picture, but it's a little tricky to perform.\n", "Q: Booting into Internet Recovery after erasing OS I'm in a situation that I put myself in accidentally.

It starts up totally fine, but as soon as I get to my desktop and try to open any app (Google chrome, Calendar, Messenger etc) the cursor just spins and the whole computer slows down. No apps will open. \nSo far I tried to fix the problem by resetting the PRAM. The weird thing is that the computer didn't make the restart sound while I was holding down the keys (alt/optcmdPR). Is this normal? It brought me to the OS X Utilities screen where I tried repairing my disk using Disk Utilities. But this didn't work. \nAny suggestions as to what I can do to fix this? I'm new to\nfixing computers but I'd really like to try fixing this myself!\n\nA: Even before trying to fix permissions - I would make a new user account and then see if you can open these three apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Calculator - check if self-contained apps work\n\n*Safari - check if networking works\n\n*Calendar - check something that can connect to cloud data - substitute contacts if you don't sync calendars. Mail is usually a huge amount to download - so that's generally a bad test app.\n\n\nIf your new account works, the system and online and network are fine and it's just your settings in your user account that are amiss (or third party apps). If you can't make a new user work - then consider wiping the Mac and restoring from your backup once you have a clean install.\n", "Q: Mac mini with Core 2 Duo will be good for Xcode? If I have a Mac mini mid 2010 with 4 gb ram and Intel core 2 duo, will it be enough to run Xcode with safari or chrome? \n\nA: Simple answer: Mac mini mid 2010 with 4GB RAM and Intel C2D can open Xcode and Safari/Chrome side by side. \nRam replacement process can be found on iFixIt. if you decide more memory is needed for your workflow.\n\nA: I write software using Xcode and a 2007 iMac with 4 GB of RAM. The processor is a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo. The version of Xcode is 7.2.1 and the OS is Yosemite 10.10.5. My Mac is not able to run Sierra, but I do have El Capitan installed in a different partition. I have not yet installed Xcode under El Capitan. My drive is traditional spinning hard disk. (I also have Windows 10 installed with the current free version Visual Studio.)\nI often have many Safari, Xcode, Finder, and Terminal windows open simultaneously.\nYou can not upgrade the processor on your Mac mini, but the memory can be increased to 16 GB of RAM. According to everymac.com:\n\n\"Originally, both the official and actual maximum RAM was 8 GB. However, as confirmed by site sponsor OWC, if running OS X 10.7.5 or higher, updated with the latest EFI, and equipped with proper specification memory modules, this model can support up to 16 GB of RAM.\"\n\n", "Q: Using Sierra to make telephone calls When I try to call my iPhone from my Mac having upgraded to Sierra, it keep on asking for my password ... what pass word?\n\nA: Your Mac uses your phone's cellular connection to place the call. What's happening is that your are calling yourself, which most mobile operators parse as dialing into voicemail. What you hear is a request for your voicemail PIN. If you dial your own number from your iPhone, you'll hear the same request. \n", "Q: Need help deleting multiple items from desktop I just accidentally copied nearly 500 pics and videos to my desktop.  Is there a way to delete all items by date from the desktop?\n\nA: Open the Desktop in Finder, sort by Date Modified or Date Added, select desired files and delete.\n", "Q: Save email on disk I'm using Fastmail and its web interface as my email client and I'd like to clean it up but save multiple hundreds of emails to some text-based format.\nIs there any macOS email client or utility that can do it?\n\nA: You can use Mozilla Thunderbird, with ImportExportTools plugin.\nIf you need a step by step guide, here is one with images, is quite old, but gives the idea. Use software/plugin from Mozilla site.\n", "Q: Shadows on the top of my iPhone turn the screen off (iOS 10, 6+) Ever since upgrading to iOS 10, my iPhone 6+ has decided that whenever a shadow is cast near the top of phone, the screen needs to turn off.\nThis was a great feature that Apple first used only in the Phone all the way back in the original iPhone - it disables the screen when you hold it to your ear, thus conserving power and preventing accidental touches from your ear.\nIn iOS 10, Apple seems to have made the astoundingly poor decision to make this behavior occur always. Anytime I try to interact with the top of my phone - pull down notification center, switch to a prior app, or use the nav bar in an app - I have to be super careful. Move your finger just a few mm too high and the whole screen shuts off for a few seconds.\nHow do I disable this? I assumed it had something to do with Siri, so I completely disabled Siri. Nope - same behavior as before. Does anyone know how to actually fix this?\n\nA: Restarting my phone (turning it off & back on) appears to have fixed this.\nI'm guessing the Phone app was hanging in the background or had failed to end a call properly or something.\n", "Q: How to Create Templates for Windows Publisher on a Mac I have a client who works in Publisher on a PC however, I work on a Mac and use InDesign. What is the best program for me to set up Templates in InDesign so they can open them up in Publisher on their system?\nJeff\n\nA: I understand that there may be different ways to achieve the end goal but since no one has come up with a solution at this point, here is what I suggest you try:\nThere is a neat little application for the Mac called Wine. All in all it allows you to run Windows applications on a mac.\nAbout 7 months ago, I used it to run Publisher on mac without a single hiccup along the way. Your client will save a bit of money with the InDesign app and (depending on the size of your project) perhaps it does the job better than any other third party applications.\nHere is a link:\nhttp://smallbusiness.chron.com/open-microsoft-publisher-mac-56433.html\nGive it a go and let me know if this answer suits your project.\n\nA: I've tried Wine and found it really difficult to setup. And when I managed to get it working it often crashed or stopped working suddenly. There are apparently some good alternatives to Microsoft Publisher on Mac though although I haven't tried any of them yet:\nhttps://machow2.com/publisher-for-mac/\n", "Q: Used MacBook Pro crashing I've just bought a new MacBook pro off craigslist and I'm having a few problems with it, it has crashed three times within two days.

graphic card, especially the dedicated one.\nThere exists a repair extension programme:\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nGo to your next applestore and have it checked.\n\nA: Before you do this (returning / chasing hardware faults) you can boot the Macbook with a clean OS from a remote drive (or an installation DVD). This will indicate whether its a system / software issue rather than hardware - if the clean OS boots fine without a crash, it's not your hardware. Could save you time and expense. \nIf you don't have another OS to hand, try adding a new user with Admin rights but NO additional software. If this works the issue is limited to a an issue on the primary account. In the same vein, boot in safe mode - this will force diagnostics and turn all but essential software off - if the MacBook works OK in this mode, its another pointer to an OS / account / software issue.\nIt's worth noting that older Macs don't behave well with a significant OS update through migration assistant e.g. 10.7 to Sierra. You can end up with a mix of old and new components which often cause beach ball stalls and crashing. Any major OS update should be on a clean drive i.e. wipe / fresh install of the OS and software - the only way to have a fast, optimised system. Since you have bought the Mac used, don't assume the OS is a clean install.\nIn 20 years of maintaining Macs, 9 times out of 10, problems are (in this order):\n• OS badly installed, updated or maintained OR unsuitable for the hardware (even if the latest OS will install, doesn't mean you should upgrade - performance most often drops, especially on Macbooks that are already de-tuned for heat, noise and battery life). \n• Ram - not enough, modern systems can use 4 to 6GB before you begin work\n• fonts - too many, badly installed within the system folder, conflicting\n• existing software incompatible with new OS\n• startup items, including Akamai, Microsoft and Adobe updaters that run constant process in the background - turn them off. Use Utlities / Activity Monitor to see what is running in the background.\n• web browsers running Flash especially with Safari on older MacBooks / OS's - will hog Ram, speed up the fans and reduce the MacBook to a crawl.\n• language kits and printer support - delete all that you don't use - will save you 10+GB of HDD and potentially improve drive access speed.\nI'm not saying it's not a graphics card issue or other hardware fault, although its worth discounting the common issues first, before you run to the expense of an 'expert' repair (or return).\n", "Q: How to get rid of non default shortcut association Shortcut cmd+c brings up Finder window when trying to copy with shortcut.

I installed linux on my first macbook back in 2008.  The optical audio light was never on before and it never went off after I ran linux.  Even after wipe and reload of OS on a new hard drive.  You can complain to the ALSA developers but you probably won't get anywhere.  I never had audio problems because of it, everything worked fine except that light was on.  You easiest solution is to ignore it or put a plastic plug in it.\n\nA: The red light coming from inside the headphone jack is an optical audio signal. This computer provides an optical audio output through the headphone port. Generally, unless an optical audio output is plugged into the port, the light is turned off by macOS (or boot camp hardware drivers on windows) However, Linux doesn't keep the light off. This is what you are seeing.\nThat being said, I don't know how to turn off the light in Linux.\n\nA: You can solve by this way!\n\" Have you tried using alsamixer to mute some of the channels?\n For me, on my Macbook Pro 7-1, I muted something called spdif-1\n (or something similar) and that turns off the red light, while leaving everything else unmuted.\" \nsource:https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2019039\n", "Q: When would my Macbook Pro (Mid 2010) no longer run the next macOS? I had to let go of my white Macbook (2007) because the new OSX would no longer run on it.\nCurrently Mactracker lists my Macbook Pro (Mid 2010) with a support status of \"vintage\" but that relates to the availability of hardware parts I read. I am not too worried about that because there have been so many of these machines produced that parts will be around for the next 10 years I bet.\nA MBP of 2007 is listed in Mactracker as still capable of running the latest macOS. A MBP 2006 is not. How many more years can I expect to keep running on a new OS with my 2010 MBP though? 3 or 4 years?\n\nA: The mid-2010 MacBook Pro is the oldest laptop officially supported by MacOS Sierra. This means it is likely that Apple will not support 2010 MBPs in the next major OS update next fall. That being said, with enough knowledge it is possible to upgrade to a new OS. If having the newest OS is important to you, you might want to look at upgrading when the next MBP is released. If you don't mind making changes to the source code of the OS, you might be able to continue pushing new OS's onto your laptop for a few years. However, even without future OS upgrades, I'd guess your computer will be relevant for another 3-4 years.\n", "Q: cmd+option replaces keyboard panel I want to use some application keyboard shortcuts.\nExample on Sublime Text: cmdalt/opt/ = Block comment current selection \nI don't understand why my keyboard changes as soon as I press (command+option). \n\nYou may notice on the image above, that panel has got replaced after command+option and so I'm unable to tab on / \n\nA: If you are talking about creating something in System Prefs/Keyboard/Shortcuts, you just type the key where the / is normally found.

I'm thinking about updating to macOS Sierra, but I'm worried if there are still any bugs. Has anyone used it yet?\n\nA: No, it is not bug free.

To find that out, clone you current system to another partition, upgrade that to Sierra, and verify that the apps and external devices you require for your work all operate the way you need them too.\n", "Q: Adobe Illustrator wont open on Sierra Anybody knows how to fix Adobe Illustrator CC 2014 on Sierra?

I have personally had issues when going from one issue to the next (Mavericks to Yosemite and Yosemite to El Capitan) and migrating my software instead of clean installing it.  Doing a clean install fixed my issue each time.\nSo, first thing to do, is uninstall and do a clean installation of Illustrator.\nAt the time of this writing, Adobe wasn't experiencing any issues with Illustrator.  See macOS Sierra (10.12) compatibility FAQ | Creative Cloud\nHowever, they do provide a link for people to report bugs.  If doing a clean install doesn't solve the problem I would report the problem.\n\nA: I had the same, identical error that you were receiving\nReinstall worked for me - First, I had to update to Java 8, so that I could use the updated Adobe App Manager.

It seemed to disappear after confirming my Serial Number, then I re-launched the Adobe Illustrator installer, re-entered my Serial Number and it installed.\nOnce it finished, I launched Adobe Illustrator CS6 with no problem\n\nA: We have Illustrator CS6, 2014, 2015, 2015.3, 2017 running on clean installs of Sierra that we update to 10.12.6 and then run the Adobe installers. \nYou may be trying to hard with sudo and all the attempts. I would probably make a new os install (wipe the drive after you backup or install on to an external drive) then only install your Illustrator. \nAt that point you can decide to migrate users or data or decide to move on to a newer version. Adobe is hard and all the versions are hard. I would choose 2015 if you worry about file changes to layout - 2015 runs so much better than 2014 with no downside for file interoperability we have noticed. \n\nA: Try deleting the Adobe .plists in Library/Preferences\n", "Q: macOS Sierra 10.12 Printing Error Just upgraded 2012 mac mini to macOS Sierra 10.12.

If I touch the Reminders widget on the lock screen, I'm taken to the Reminders app (after logging in), and there my reminders are visible. What do I have to do to get my reminders to show up on my lock screen?\n\nA: The Reminders widget only shows upcoming reminders. That is, those with a date/time set for them, and that date/time is still in the future.

I want to use an Apple Watch 2 to track my sleep. In order to achieve this I will need to wear the Apple Watch during sleep, which creates an issue around battery usage. So my thinking is that I can put the watch on charge twice daily on most days: in the morning while getting ready for work and again at night while getting ready for bed. By doing this I estimate the battery will have enough power to keep the watch going 24/7 on most days.\nObviously this means I need a sleep tracking app to do the tracking. My requirements are:\n\n\n*\n\n*It must be highly efficient in terms of battery usage\n\n*It can track sleep while the watch is in Airplane mode\n\n*It can synchronise data with the iOS Health app on my iPhone\n\n*It must be able to provide a summary of my sleep on the Apple Watch itself\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not mind paying for the App if doing so results in me getting a much better product\n\n*I am open to using 3rd party devices if it means the quality of tracking/measurements are much higher\n\n*While not a requirement, if the app also supports syncing data with other HealthKit apps that would be a plus\n\n\nI did consider posting this in the Software Recommendations community, but it didn't seem to have the appropriate tags. \n\nA: I thought it was time to share my experiences with using sleep tracking apps on my Apple Watch.\nNot long after posting the question I downloaded Sleep++ and used that for quite a while. Sleep++ works well. It is power efficient and met most of my requirements. It's not perfect (e.g. you need to manually start/stop sleep tracking, but it's free (with ads - but the ads don't appear on the Watch) so you can give it a good try before paying to remove ads. It's also very well supported by the developer.\nMy hope was to use this app until Apple's own implementation of a sleep tracking app in watchOS was released. But since this wasn't ready in time for watchOS 4, and since I upgraded to a new Series 3 Apple Watch, I decided it was time to look at another sleep tracking app - namely one that doesn't require me to manually start and stop it (for those times I forgot, or those times I dozed off unintentionally).\nI settled on AutoSleep which is a paid app. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and have been very impressed with how well it works and how it meets all my requirements.\nIt can automatically detect your sleep (assuming you're wearing the watch) or you can use it manually (similar to Sleep++ but without having to wear the watch). Obviously using it manually is not going to provide all the measurements, but it's equivalent to what Sleep++ could do.\nAlso, if you're wearing the watch, you can manually enable the Lights Off option. This is not necessary, and since one of the best selling points of this app is that it automatically detects your sleep without manual intervention, you may not want to opt for this. But if you do, it tells the app that you've officially gone to bed (hence the 'lights off' label) and the app will also track how long it takes you to fall asleep after going to bed. Useful if you want to also track that metric.\nOne of the other great features of the app is that on the iPhone you can tweak it to suit your sleep. That is, the app provides some nice measurements and graphs to illustrate your sleep and, if you notice it hasn't detected your sleep accurately enough (e.g. you know you woke up during the night and the app hasn't detected that), you can alter how sensitive it is or isn't to tracking your sleep. For me, I've never had to tweak it. It has accurately recognised my start sleep time, as well as my restlessness and any time awake in bed during the night. It has also detected times that I've dozed off in front of Netflix, while reading a book, etc regardless of the time of day!\nAll in all I am very happy with this app and it's very close to how I imagine Apple will implement its own version.\nAs there is no free version available, feel free to ask me any questions about this app in the comments below.\nNOTE: I am not affiliated with this app in any way.\n", "Q: How to sort/group notifications in iOS 10 Notification Center In the Notification Center in iOS 9 it was possible to group notifications per app or by time/day.

This is the first thing that I noticed as soon as I installed the new iOS 10 on my iPhone 6. I had words with the Apple support and they told me that it is no longer possible to group notifications by app with the new iOS 10.

The Calendar app would start and crash as it was \"updating calendars\". To test that it was my old data causing the issue I created a folder in ~Library/Calendar and dropped all the contents of ~Library/Calendar into it (essentially hiding all the previous data). I then launched the calendar app and viola, it started just fine, but empty. It did load my CalDev account I have on my Synology. Instead of spending more time fiddling with my old calendar data, I just let it rebuild itself from the Synology. I assume it will do the same if you have a copy of your calendar synced with your own local server or a cloud.\n", "Q: I can't update my Mac software to the latest version - Error occurred (102) Every time I click the update button to update my Mac software, a pop up shows up - An error occurred while loading the update (102).\nI don't know what to do; I can't update my software.

I read that you can expand you Macbook's storage with SD card.

So download an older installer package (filebench 1.4.4) from FileBench ported to Mac OS X or direct link.\nInstall the app. You may have to disable SIP and - in Sierra - Gatekeeper to do so. The package will be installed to /opt/filebench.\nTo start the app in interactive mode enter in Terminal.app:\n/opt/filebench/bin/go_filebench\n\nNow choose a workload at the prompt - preconfigured workloads can be found in /opt/filebench/config (e.g. fileserver.conf):\nfilebench> load fileserver\n\nSet a working directory and other variables (most have default values):\nset $dir=/tmp\nset $filesize=612458\n\nand a run time in seconds:\nrun 600\n\nTo create your own workloads visit filebench Wiki and check the WML link.\nTo \"simulate\" CPU-load install prime95 and configure it.\n\nIn my virtual environment (Sierra - 2 CPUs/4 GB memory) running go_filebench alone already creates a total CPU-load of 70% (go_filebench: ~140%). So I don't have to start prime95 additionally. In your environment you may have to start it though.\n", "Q: When swiping between spaces, sometimes the background moves and sometimes it doesnt Since upgrading to Sierra I've noticed that sometimes when I swipe between spaces the background image moves left or right as I swipe along with whatever icons I have on my desktop and whatever (lets say) open finder windows I have. Other times the background remains static but everything else moves left or right as I swipe. \nI have the same (default) bg image for all spaces.\nI have also noticed that the behavior seems to remembered by the space I am moving to/from. For instance, right now I have 2 full screen spaces and then 4 \"desktop\" spaces and then 2 more full screen spaces. And if I swipe into or out of the desktop 4 space then the bg remains static, but swiping to any other space, the background moves.\nI realize this is not a big deal, but it's annoying... thoughts?\n\nA: I have this exact same problem.

I am still not sure If I wish to upgrade to macOS Sierra, If I will upgrade it will be caused only by the fact that macOS Sierra should fix some security vulnerabilities , therefore I would like to understand more deeply what type of security vulnerabilities does it fix?\n\nA: All security fixes in Sierra 10.12.0 compared to the latest El Capitan release 10.11.6 are available here:\nAbout the security content of macOS Sierra 10.12.\nAs far as I know most or all of the vulnerabilities are still unfixed in El Capitan and Yosemite. Usually a Security Update for the prior two systems is released at the same time as the new system comes out - not this time.\n\nTo get an impression of the severity of the vulnerability you can look up the CVE-number in different databases like CVE Details, National Vulnerability Database or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. \nIMHO the former are more informative for laypersons because they provide a vulnerability scoring (CVSS3/CVSS2) (like a traffic light food labeling system) and vulnerability types.

The NAS will contain only a certain number of backed up files, so before copying a new one I delete the oldest of the existing.\nFirst of all the script defines all the paths, directory and file names into variables\n# Defines directories\nORIGEN='/Library/path-to-directories/'\nDESTINAS='/Volumes/path-to-backup/'\nDESTITAR='/Library/path-to-temp/'\n\n# Defines names of the files and folders to delete (OLDDIR) and copy (NEWDIR)\nOLDTAR=`/bin/ls /Volumes/path-to-backup/ | head -n 1`\nNEWDIR=`/bin/ls /Library/path-to-directories/ | tail -n 1`\n\nThen using the variable names it:\nCreates a tar compressed file from the original directory.

Everything runs smoothly except in this step:\n/usr/bin/sudo /bin/rm $DESTINAS$OLDTAR\n\nThe log file shows no errors but there's nothing in the place of the $OLDTAR variable, like it is not resolved, so it actually executes:\n/usr/bin/sudo /bin/rm /Volumes/path-to-backup/\n\nHowever if I run the commands in the terminal one by one I get it to work well. It may be a problem of user permissions?\n\nA: This is not a real answer, but I would pick apart your question into 4 smaller tasks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up permissions / ACL so you don't need sudo if at all possible\n\n*Just set up a script to tar the files locally - and date stamp the backup\n\n*Set up a script to rsync the backup directory from the local server to the NAS. You can use the --delete option or --delete-after if you want to expire old backups over time.\n\n*Set up a script to purge dated backups in the local backup folder\n\n\nAlso - if you can't avoid using root /sudo - add this line tmutil snapshot before any delete and check one time to allow for local backups tmutil enablelocal in general so you have a backup if a script deletes too much. Time Machine will allow you recover rapidly from any errors in the logic of the scripts. \nLastly - for debugging bash - run bash -x script or set debugging set -x to see the values of the variables and see if you have a path error / encoding error or something else amiss.\n\nA: I've found what was going on: the user executing the script had not sufficient permissions to read on the NAS directory, so the result of this:\nOLDTAR=$(/bin/ls /Volumes/path-to-backup/ | head -n 1)\n\nwas an empty string, this is where the script failed.

Is it the change of a setting that takes a while to kick in?\nKind regards\n\nA: The \"Optimize [device] storage\" setting, associated with iCloud Photo Library does not work instantly, so it may explain the behavior you describe. It needs to upload your originals to iCloud and then it may kick in only if you seem to need space on your device.\nFrom an article on Macworld:\n\nIf you take a photo with your iPhone (or other iOS device) camera, iOS doesn’t downsample or optimize images or video until it’s uploaded it to iCloud Photo Library and the storage is needed on the iOS device.\n\n", "Q: El Capitan Downloads folder in dock doesn't expand When I click on my downloads folder in dock it opens the downloads folder in Finder, instead of showing the expanded file contents.

After a few hours I did manage to solve it by sort of hacking the boot process. The problem is OSX detects some error upon boot and calls up fdsk to solve it. Then fsck returns error code 34 and the boot script halts the system. I tried and failed to disable the fsck call. But... I did succeed at cheating at the boot script and have fsck return a 0 exit code, which worked.. This is what I did:\nDisable System Integrity Protection in Mac OS X. Instructions here.\nLog in to Single-User mode (instructions here) and mount the file system as readwrite.\nYou need to replace /sbin/fsck with a script that returns exit 0. To do so try the following commands:\nmv /sbin/fsck /sbin/fsck.backup\necho '#!/bin/bash' > /sbin/fsck\necho 'exit 0' >> /sbin/fsck\nchmod +x /sbin/fsck\n\nYou might get some error messages about SIP being disabled but it did work for me. You then reboot.\nUpon reboot, OS X will detect the 'problem' and call our fsck script, which will return a 0 exit code and you'll log in your system. \nIf you succeed I suggest you back up all your important data and reinstall OSX. If you don't, remember you don't have a proper /sbin/fsck anymore so any program relying on it (maybe Disk Utility?) might have an unexpected behavior.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Every single 3rd party font gives me validation serious errors I recently got El Capitan 10.11.6 installed on my MacBook.

What has worked for me has been to install an app called Typelight. I go into Typelight, open the font that I downloaded to my computer but didn't install yet, and then save the font to my DESKTOP. It doesn't work if I save it anywhere else, don't ask me why. After that, I open the font by clicking on it on my desktop, then I click \"install\", and it works with no error messages. More of a hassle, yes, but at least it's a way around the problem.\n\nA: Not actually ever heard of this, but you can apply some basic troubleshooting assuming that the downloaded fonts are not damaged by the process or when they are written to your HD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery mode (hold Command R at boot) and run Disk Utility and repair the disk. If you get persistent errors let us know what they are and/or try another disk repair utility (Diskwarrior, etc.)\n\n*Run a cleaning utility, like Onyx and let it clean everything on the computer (Automation tab) and reboot. This may clean up damaged caches.\n\n*Download the El Capitan Combo Updater Quit out of all Apps and run it. This may fix damaged parts of the OS.\n\n\nIt IS unlikely that all fonts you download are damaged, those three steps should help eliminate some of the more obvious possibilities.\n", "Q: What can cause the SMC to repeatedly need to be reset? I currently have a problem with my MacBook Pro where the SMC keeps getting screwed up and needing to be reset. The result is always that my keyboard and trackpad become useless, and I have to use an external keyboard and trackpad.  \nI took it to the Apple Store and they just reset the SMC, which seemed to fix it, but within a few hours it happened again.  I was once or twice able to reset the SMC myself with an external keyboard, but the latest time it happened (always within a short time of the last reset) I could not get the key sequence to work using an external keyboard (and obviously the built-in keyboard is useless!).\nThis is really aggravating.  Is there anything that could be causing this?  \n\nA: Repeatedly needing to reset the SMC indicates a hardware failure. Apple generally replaces entire components - so you'd get a new logic board / GPU / processor board and then that failing board would get analyzed / repaired as appropriate.\nIt could be as simple as some sensors that are bad and reporting continuous bad readings that the SMC can't handle. It also could be the SMC itself has issues. Without analyzing the logic signals of that processor - hard to guess. The main idea would to realize that a mail in repair for MacBook run about $300 and take a few days - so when your aggravation exceeds that cost to remedy - you can get it fixed. If you don't feel that computer is worth the $300 - you can consider a new computer once you can't rely on this hardware. Be sure to keep good backups, SMC and logic board failures generally leave the system unbootable so it costs more to recover data after it fails. On T2 Macs, you can’t get data off a failed SMC/T2 module as the decryption keys are exclusively stored there in a Secure Enclave. \n", "Q: Apps randomly crash when using keyboard shortcuts in popups For some weird reason, hitting Enter, Escape, or some other action keys crash the save dialog, open dialog, Command+F, and many others.

Lolo Joe wants earphone jack to plug and use big speakers but at the same time he wants to partner the music coming out the earphone jack and his Bluetooth system and speakers. Is it even possible to use the earplug connection and the Bluetooth system and devices at the same time?\n\nA: Yes.\nYou can do this by aggregating your audio devices.\nThis is a function that is built into macOS; you don't need to purchase or install any additional software.\nUnder MIDI Audio Setup (under Applications -> Utilities), you create a new \"virtual\" device that aggregates audio devices:\n\n\nWhile the pictures posted are for an input device, you can do this with output devices as well; Bluetooth, USB, and physical.\nOnce you create your aggregated output device of both the speakers and BT speakers, you set your application to use that device and sound will play from both devices.\n", "Q: What takes place during an iPhone hard reset? In response to an iPhone 7 freezing issue I'm having, it was suggested to try a hard reset (holding power + volume down for 10 seconds for iPhone 7 or holding power + home on older iPhones). \nThis got me wondering what an hard reset actually does. After searching around online, I've sound some that say it is just a hard power-off (isn't this what holding just the power button does?) and others mentioning something about a library being rebuilt. Overall, many, at least from several years ago, cited it as a cure-all for various phone issues.\nDoes anyone know what a hard reset does? I'm envisioning something analogous booting a Mac in safe mode or doing a PRAM/SMC reset on a Mac, but online searches so far are leaving me unsure. \n\nA: I do not know for sure that this happens but I was told that in order for IOS to do anything except just it's usual booting functions you actually need to do a hard reset three times in a row.\nNot sure why, and this was advice I read (don't remember where) several years ago. Perhaps 3 hard resets in a row trigger some sort of flag that forces IOS to do some special maintenance, not really sure but I am throwing it out in case someone else has heard this or knows is it complete and utter BS.\n\nA: I actually wrote this up for the tag wiki today, so here you go.\n\nThe hard reset process on iOS is akin to a power cycle on a computer. In that process, RAM is cleared, pending operations are completed, etc. For iOS, data marked for deletion is permanently deleted during a hard reset.\nThis includes app data: If you delete an app and reinstall it without doing a hard reset in between, all data is immediately available again as if the app was never removed. In cases where something within the app's data or preferences is corrupted and causing problems, not doing a hard reset will cause the problems to continue, since the same data will be in use.\nAn iOS power cycle is closer to the hibernate function on a computer, where all information is written to non-volatile storage and restored when the computer is taken out of hibernate. On iOS devices, the only real benefit to a power cycle is getting fresh network connections.\n\n", "Q: Where can I find the OS X installer?

In fact, the great majority of Mac owners do not have Bootcamp installed. Bootcamp is simply a tool released by Apple that allows Mac owners to install and boot their Macs natively into a Microsoft Windows installation. This happens alongside an existing macOS installation, but does not allow you to run Windows and macOS concurrently. It is a good option if you need to run Windows programs that are CPU-intensive in nature and don't lend themselves to working well in a virtual machine (such as ones set up with Parallels or VMWare Fusion). \nAnswer to question 1\nI've looked at the photos I asked you to post and the second option after booting up from the USB should be Install OS X, not Reinstall OS X. This implies to me that you're USB is not in fact bootable because the 'Reinstall' option would normally appear when booting from the Recovery partition.\nCan you try choosing the Reinstall OS X option instead to see whether you're able to successfully install a version of OS X. Let us know how you go.\nAlso, the photo of the error you get provides a lot more information. Basically the reason you can't erase the drive is because it can't be unmounted. This tells us a lot more about what may be going on, so if choosing the Reinstall OS X option gives you no joy then we've got more info to work with.\n[EDIT]\nSince you're unable to unmount the internal drive, and since the various terminal commands haven't worked, I strongly suspect that my earlier suspicion is correct - that your 'bootable' USB is in fact not bootable. Your question doesn't detail how you created the bootable USB, so let's start again using these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recreate your bootable USB. Since you're limited to doing this on\nWindows, follow the steps in this article.\n\n*Plug the USB into your Mac.\n\n*Switch the Mac on and immediately press the Option key.\n\n*When you see the choice of drives, select the USB.\n\n*Once the OS X Utilities window appears, select Disk Utility.\n\n*Try to erase your internal drive and see if you're now able to erase the disk. If unsuccessful take note of the error message etc. Regardless, go to the next step.\n\n*Exit Disk Utilities and select Install OS X.\n\n*Follow the steps to install OS X.\n\n\nIf you fail at either (or both) steps 6 and/or 8, please report back with what happens.\n", "Q: Texting without an assigned phone number I have an iPhone 5C that is no longer connected to a service plan. I have given it to my son to use as an iPod-type device. I have an Android phone. Can he text me on my Android from the non-connected iPhone?\n\nA: He should be able to text you and anyone else. He needs to be on wifi (only) and use a 3rd-party texting app (for messages to Android) or Messages to another Apple device. \nHe will not be able to send any messages when not on wifi because he won't have any cell signal. \n", "Q: Remove sparse image partition on El Capitan I have a sparse image partition on El Capitan.

Or with other words: a sparse image partition is no physical partition on your hard disk.\nDisk images are in fact files which contain a file system which can be mounted, unmounted or even increased or decreased in size. Mounted images usually appear in the file system in /Volumes/. Then they are listed in the diskutil list output but as /dev/diskX (disk image).\nSince they are virtual disks they can't be deleted with diskutil on a physical disk. Instead use the Finder. If you don't know where the image file resides but the image is mounted just enter hdiutil info. The image path is listed then:\n...\nimage-path      : /Users/me/Pictures/ext.sparseimage\n\nNow you can delete the image in the Finder or in the shell with rm ....\n\nI think under the hood the app Disk Utility doesn't use diskutil but hdiutil to deal with disk image files. Therefore you can create them but you can't delete them.\n", "Q: How to use logger command on Sierra?

Knowing Apple it'll be wrong come 10.16.\nApple rejigged macOS' logging system in 10.12 (Sierra), replacing traditional syslog style service with a new \"unified logging system\". This new system, which has no formal name other than \"unified logging system\" (or os_log in the system man pages), has a number of goals - primarily aimed at app debugging rather than sysadmin. The sheer volume of log messages being generated under this regime is astounding.\nGood overview: https://eclecticlight.co/2018/03/19/macos-unified-log-1-why-what-and-how/\nPractically, this means that log events are generally not viewable in any file, e.g. /var/log/system.log, or even the Console app. Rather, the cli log utility must be used; or one of the apps provided by eclecticlight.co, above.\nGenerating Log Messages\nAs of 10.15, the traditional syslog interface seems to still be functional. e.g. logger works.\nos_log has multiple levels, including Default, Info, Debug, and some others. syslog levels seem to be mapped to the these: evidently debug > Debug, info > Info, all others to Default.\nViewing Log Messages\n\n\n*\n\n*use the log command, ref the man page for details; useful sub-commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*show: query logs\n\n\n*\n\n*--info and/or --debug to see info/debug level logs; need to provide both to get both\n\n*--last time[h|m|d]: show recent events, sec/min/hrs/days\n\n\n*stream: tail logs\n\n\n*\n\n*--level info|debug to see info messages; debug includes info\n\n*can provide --process (pid|name) to filter a specific process name (shortcut for --predicate \"process ...\")\n\n\n*note: sub-commands vary in how the log level is provided and support for process name (yay consistency...)\n\n\n*output can be in a few different formats, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*--style compact: briefest: timestamp (sans TZ), abbreviated Type (e.g. Df = Default, I = Info, Db = Debug), process name and PID:ThreadID, and the log message\n\n*--style syslog: traditional syslog\n\n*JSON and JSON lines (JSONL aka NDJSON) formats\n\n*as well as the default comprehensive \"human readable\" form\n\n\n*a \"filter\" mechanism is provided - and practically required - to extract the desired logs: --predicate [filter]\n\n\n*\n\n*a filter is one or more patterns of the form \"[key] [operator] [value]\", e.g. process == \"logger\"\n\n\n*\n\n*string operators are case- and diacratic- sensitive by default, append [cd] to make insensitive\n\n\n*useful keys are\n\n\n*\n\n*process: process name\n\n*eventMessage: message content\n\n*logType: default, info, debug, etc\n\n\n*useful operators are\n\n\n*\n\n*==/BEGINSWITH: anchored string match (==[cd] for case-insensitive string comparison)\n\n*MATCHES: regex (\"ICU Regular Expressions\")\n\n\n*\n\n*regexes are anchored start and end, i.e. MATCHES \"Foo\" will not match \"Foo was here\", whereas MATCHES \"Foo.*\" will; MATCHES[cd] \"foo.*\" will also hit\n\n*take care to escape \\ from the shell\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nEverything logged by logger in the last 20 minutes:\n% for sev in alert error warning notice info debug; do\n  logger -p user.$sev \"log test user.$sev\"\ndone\n\n% log show --style compact --info --debug --predicate 'process == \"logger\"' --last 20m\nFiltering the log data using \"process == \"logger\"\"\nTimestamp               Ty Process[PID:TID]\n2020-05-22 21:06:05.697 Df logger[52036:f75d81] log test user.alert\n2020-05-22 21:06:06.709 Df logger[52038:f75d8b] log test user.error\n2020-05-22 21:06:07.721 Df logger[52040:f75d95] log test user.warning\n2020-05-22 21:06:08.732 Df logger[52042:f75dad] log test user.notice\n2020-05-22 21:06:09.741 I  logger[52044:f75db7] log test user.info\n2020-05-22 21:06:10.752 Db logger[52046:f75dbc] log test user.debug\n\nEvery log message in the last 24 hours matching the regex .*log\\s+test.*er.*\n% log show --style compact --info  --debug --predicate 'eventMessage MATCHES[cd] \".*log\\\\s+test.*er.*\"' --last 24h\n...\n\nContinual stream of logger logs:\n% log stream --process logger --level debug --style syslog\nFiltering the log data using \"process BEGINSWITH[cd] \"logger\"\"\nTimestamp                       (process)[PID]\n2020-05-22 21:16:16.593184+1000  localhost logger[52341]: log test user.alert\n2020-05-22 21:16:16.599099+1000  localhost logger[52342]: log test user.error\n2020-05-22 21:16:16.604287+1000  localhost logger[52343]: log test user.warning\n2020-05-22 21:16:16.608727+1000  localhost logger[52344]: log test user.notice\n2020-05-22 21:16:16.613164+1000  localhost logger[52345]: log test user.info\n2020-05-22 21:16:16.617368+1000  localhost logger[52346]: log test user.debug\n...\n\n\nA: I solved this issue by having a script that uses netcat to send specific logs every 10min from a launchdaemon.

This could be a bug.\nYou can still use logger to send to he new logging system, but will have to use the Console app or the cli log utility or the new API to see the results.\n\nA: This is no real answer but a workaround and too long for a comment.\nI faced the same problem in Sierra trying to log a homebrew update shell script including logger commands (which worked in El Capitan). I had to abandon logger and simply used echo, output redirection and a new log file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nBrew=/usr/local/bin/brew\nBrewup_Log=/Users/user/Library/Logs/brewup.log\n\necho \"$(date \"+%Y.%m.%d %H:%M:%S\")\" >> $Brewup_Log 2>&1\n$Brew update 2>&1 >>$Brewup_Log\n....\n\n", "Q: How can Skype track downloaded file on the file system? Using Skype 7.37 on OS X El Capitan, observing this highly unusual behaviour:\n\n\n*\n\n*I receive a photo in a Skype chat.\n\n*I click \"Reveal in Finder\", Skype places the photo in my Downloads folder as it is configured to do.\n\n*I move the file to eg. Dropbox.\n\n*I click \"Reveal in Finder\" again - Skype correctly opens the Dropbox folder!\n\n*I move the file again to eg. Desktop and rename it by appending \"test\" or such.\n\n*I click \"Reveal in Finder\" again - Skype correctly opens Desktop!!!\n\n\nIn steps 4 and 6 I was totally expecting Skype to download the photo again and store it into Downloads.\nCan anyone else replicate this behaviour? How is Skype able to do this?\n\nA: I don't use Skype but I suspect the fact it came from Skype is stored in one of two places. To find out, copy a Skype download to your Home directory and start Terminal. If your file is called, say, photo.jpg, you would run:\nmdls photo.jpg\n\nto list the metadata and something in there will refer to Skype or its bundle identifier.\nAlternatively, run:\nxattr -l photo.jpg\n\nand see if Skype is listed in its WhereFrom attribute.\n", "Q: Can I use the prepared USB from a failed partition Boot Camp So I am attempting to install Windows 10 from an .iso on my mac and I loaded it into Boot Camp and let it run, it managed to run till the partitioning bit and then it failed, however I did manage to save the WindowsSupport.dmg, is there a way to install Windows 10 with the USB Boot Camp prepared before it failed.\n\nA: Generally, the following applies.\n\n\n*\n\n*The 2011 and earlier Macs use both a DVD and flash drive to install\nWindows. The DVD contains Windows and the flash drive contains the\nBoot Camp Support Software. Apple does not officially support Windows\n10 on these models, but Windows 10 can be installed on most of these models using the legacy BIOS boot method. You should then install the\nlatest Boot Camp Support Software available for your model Mac.\n\n*The 2012 through 2014 Macs use a flash drive to install Windows. The\nthe flash drive contains both Windows and the Boot Camp Support\nSoftware. The Boot Camp Assistant should be used to create the flash\ndrive. Windows 10 is installed on these models using the EFI boot\nmethod.\n\n*For the 2015 and later Mac models, the Boot Camp Assistant installs\nWindows 10 directly from the Windows 10 iso file. So there is not\nneed for either a DVD or flash drive. Windows 10 is installed on\nthese models using the EFI boot method.\n\n\nWhen installing Windows, there is no need to partition the drive. This is done by the Boot Camp Assistant before the Windows installer starts. However, you do need to format the partition where Windows is to be installed. You need to tell the Windows installer to preform this task. So when you see the window shown below, you should select \"Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)\". Next, select the Boot Camp partition, then click on the \"Format\" button.\n\n", "Q: Contacts app on new iPad incorrectly assumes default country code After doing a restore from an old iPad to a new iPad, and syncing up iCloud, contacts stored without a country code are displayed incorrectly. \nIn Australia, the mobile number format is 04xx xxx xxx, or +61 4xx xxx xxx (with country code). \nThe result of this is that text messages (or iMessages) received are not matched up to a contact. Additionally, the phone numbers appear in the incorrect format in the Contacts app (04x xxxx xxx), suggesting it is maybe assuming an American country code or something.\nThe iPad does not have a SIM card in it. I tried putting a working Australian SIM card in it, and it immediately fixed the problem... until I removed it and everything went back to how it was. \nDoes anyone know how to change this default without having a SIM card permanently installed? Seems like there should be a setting for this somewhere, but I cannot find anything. I've googled and the closest I can find is a setting called \"Internationale dial assist\" inside Settings > Phone but this area doesn't exist on an iPad and I cannot find anything similarly named. Any help would be very much appreciated!\n\nA: Please check the settings under\nSettings > General > Language & Region:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone Language: English (Australia)\n\n*Region (Australia)\n\n\nIdeally your iPad should detect your contacts' numbers correctly now, but it doesn't hurt to restart your device.\nAlso, after setting the settings above you may need to sign out of iMessage and log in again.\n", "Q: Sound files in System/Library/Sounds gone with macOS Sierra upgrade? I noticed that all the sound files in System/Library/Sounds have been replaced with a TextEdit file called \"Sounds\" with my upgrade to macOS Sierra. Is there a way to get the sound files I put there back? In the terminal, when I do file sounds it prints out sounds: IFF data, AIFF audio. Can I get it back into multiple AIFF files?\n\nA: I have upgraded to macOS Sierra (10.12) from OS X El Capitan (10.11) as well.\nmacOS 10.12: In my /System/Library/Sounds/ directory there are 14 AIFF sound files with a time stamp of Aug 20 2016.\nIn OS X El Capitan there are the same 14 AIFF sound files in the same directory. Their timestamp is Aug 26 2015.\nI have confirmed the same files for three other Macs that were upgraded from 10.11 to 10.12.\n\nTo answer your question:\nYes, you should be able to copy the AIFF files to your /System/Library/Sounds/ directory from another installation.\nPlease keep in mind that you need to copy them using sudo as this is a system folder.\n", "Q: Mouse Keys randomly enabled.

I don't have a bluetooth keyboard (although I do have a bluetooth mouse which I was not using at the time). This is the second time it has happened.\nThis is either a software or hardware bug, but it seems oddly specific to be a hardware bug when I don't see other random keypresses. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I diagnose this? I can't find any mention of 'mouse' in system.log. \n\n*Is this a known bug? I can't seem to find any other mentions.\n\n*Can I prevent this from happening again? \n\n\nA: Default trigger switch for Mouse Keys is to hit  Opt ⌥   5 times.\nYou will usually hear the little 'zipper' noise it makes as it switches.\nOccasionally, you can trigger it accidentally with seemingly unrelated presses of  Opt ⌥ . To reverse it, just tap it 5 times again.\nTo disable it entirely, System Prefs > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad > Options... & uncheck\n\n", "Q: Can users/enterprises download and resign IPA within Apple ToS?

It does not appear in the file com.apple.dock.plist, so where is Siri added to the Dock?\n\nA: I answered a similar question here: OSX 10.8 - How to keep a custom dock for all users that login\nThis answer should still apply to macOS Sierra.\n\nDug up my notes from when I first modified the user template in our base images.  Ran back through the process, changing the default Dock to have about 15 items, on a fresh Mac and these steps worked.  I did a lot of this from the command line, so as to not fuss with changing/reverting permissions using Finder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Arrange your Dock however you would like for it to appear on new user accounts, changing the orientation and adding/removing applications.\n\n*Browse to ~/Library/Preferences and copy the com.apple.Dock.plist file to your desktop.\n\n*Open Terminal and start a root session by typing: sudo -s\n\n*Enter your current account's password when prompted\n\n*Copy the copy of your modified dock preference file from your desktop to the User Template in your Mac's System folder.: cp ~/Desktop/com.apple.Dock.plist /System/Library/User\\ Template/English.lproj/Preferences\nThat should do the trick.  I tested this on a fresh Mac by logging into both a Guest account and a new (created after the above steps) standard user account, both accounts showed the proper Dock with 15~ items.\nIt shouldn't be necessary with these steps but if you run into trouble you should verify that the /System/Library/User Template folder has permissions set to: System - Read/Write & Everyone - No access.\n", "Q: ios10 and os x10.5.8 my iphone ios10 no longer syncs with iphoto on my old imac which has only been updated to osx10.5.8 (no further auto-upgrades recommended by apple software updater).\nI understand it is possible to do a modest OSX software upgrade to the imac with 3rd party software. Can someone describe how to do this, what to use and what OSX version to upgrade to?\nimac 7.1\nintel core 2 duo\n2GHz\n3GB memory\n(old but still a great internet browser/photo viewer)\n\nA: According to Everymac, that machine can update all the way to El Capitan, 10.11 - however, the first step would be to get it to 10.6.8, Snow Leopard, which was the last of the paid upgrades shipped on CD/DVD.\nIt's still available from Apple directly [or can often be picked up on eBay for even less]\nOnce on 10.6.8 you can jump directly to El Capitan through the App Store - in fact it's actually quite difficult to get any intermediate OS. Apple have intentionally left a path to El Capitan open, for machines that cannot run Sierra, which includes your iMac.\nYou might struggle with some older software needing updates to work properly with such a big jump, but it would allow you to run the latest iTunes & also Photos, the replacement for iPhoto [with a direct cross-grade/conversion within Photos itself] & keep your connection to your phone alive for some time yet.\n", "Q: Mac mini starting itself when power is applied Having a weird issue with a Mac mini.\nAt the end of the day, I perform a full shutdown.

I have some photos taken in 2012 and when I export them as originals to a folder they have a creation date of July 2016. Running an EXIF detailer showed the images to have been taken in 2012, so why does Photos export them and add another date to it? \nI tried exporting my whole album from 2009-2016 and noticed some pictures taken in years prior to 2016 to appear in July or other months of this year as well.\nI would really appreciate if someone can shed some light on this issue.\n\nA: Like the case of apple icloud photos, when you have all the information in the EXIF details, like you already know.\nTo restore all the dates information I followed this steps\n\n*\n\n*Download exiftool\n\n\n*Run next command to fix the dates in all the files inside the folder(recursively)\n\nexiftool -r '-FileModifyDate<DateTimeOriginal' \"hereYourDirName\"\n\n\n\n\n*Run next command to fix the dates in MOV files inside the folder(recursively)\n\nexiftool -r '-FileModifyDate<CreationDate' \"hereYourDirName/*.mov\"\n\n\n\n\n*If you have the No writable tags... error, this probably means that you don't have the permission, so you can fix the owner and the permission with these command\n\nsudo chown -R yourSessionUser directoryName\nsudo chmod -R 775 directoryName\n\n\nThis will restore all the dates. I hope that this information be useful\n\n\nNow some other helping commands\nTo can check if your file has all the EXIF information you can check it with this command. Useful to be sure that you have the DateTimeOriginal with the right date.\n\nexiftool -a -s -G directoryName\n\n\nIf you want to update the EXIF just on some extensions, for example just photos, you can use this commands. Useful if you have a los of mov files or files without the EXIF information, like this you will skip them, you will not have a warning and the exiftool will finish faster.\n\n*\n\n*Generate the file called filesToUpdate.txt with the list of files that you want to update.\n\nfind hereTheAbsolutePathToTheFolder/* -type f | grep -E\n'\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|heic|JPG|JPEG|PNG|HEIC)$' > filesToUpdate.txt\n\n\nThe list of jpg|jpeg|png|heic|JPG|JPEG|PNG|HEIC, is the list of extensions that you want to consider.\n\n\n*Now the command to run all this files is like this:\n\nexiftool '-FileModifyDate<DateTimeOriginal' -@ filesToUpdate.txt\n\n\nThis command is to check which extensions files you have in a folder. Useful to check which extensions you want to include in previous command.\n\nfind hereThePathToTheFolderThat/* -type f | \nperl -ne 'print $1 if m/\\.([^.\\/]+)$/' | sort -u\n\n\n\nA: in case you would like to use touch instead of SetFile:\nfor file in *; do touch -mt \"$(exiftool -p '$CreateDate' -d '%Y%m%d%H%M.%S' \"$file\")\" \"$file\"; done\n\n\nA: Note that, in order for your files to have a created date that matches the EXIF \"photo taken\" date, you must use Export Unmodified Originals. Modified images may have been edited within Photos which results in a new file being created, and using the normal Export will export that modified file with the later creation date.\nThere are some options in this post on Photography SE for changing a file's creation date to match EXIF data. You should never attempt to use these on files within the .photoslibrary bundle! Export your files first.\nExifTool is a very powerful command-line application for reading and writing EXIF data in a variety of files, including videos. However, on Macs, it cannot write the file creation date. There's a way around that using a bit of bash scripting.\nHere's a command that will work for both photo and video files:\nfor file in *; do SetFile -d \"$(exiftool -p '$CreateDate' -d '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S' \"$file\")\" \"$file\"; done\n\nEssentially a loop is run over files in the current directory. exiftool is used to read the EXIF creation date tag, and SetFile is used to write as the file's creation date. The way it is written, it will affect all files in the current directory, so I suggest you move all files that you wanted modified into a directory with nothing else in it, and run the command from that directory.\n\nA: The accepted answer assumes one knows how to use the command line. If you do not, here are the assumed precursor steps:\n1) Install a package manager, if you don't have one installed already. (And then use it forever to install new software :))\n(Recommended:)\nFor Mac: use Homebrew - https://brew.sh/\nFor Windows: use Chocolatey - https://chocolatey.org/\n2) Using your (^^ newly installed) package manager, install exiftool, which is free software for viewing/working with media metadata:\nOn Mac:\nbrew install exiftool\n\nOn Windows:\nchoco install exiftool\n\n3) Navigate to the directory containing your image/movie files by using the 'change directory' command: cd - (Read more about how to use the command line here: https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands)\ncd {insert-name-of-your-file-directory-here}\n\n4) The last command is based on the above accepted answer(s), but I found that I needed to switch this to CreationDate for it to actually reflect the original photos'/videos' capture date. And I also opted for using touch:\nOne-liner version (copy and paste this):\nfor file in *; do touch -t \"$(exiftool -p '$CreationDate' -d '%Y%m%d%H%M' \"$file\")\" \"$file\"; done\n\n(Same code, but formatted for readability in case you want to understand what is happening):\nfor file in *; do   \\\n    touch -t \"$(exiftool -p '$CreationDate' -d '%Y%m%d%H%M' \"$file\")\" \"$file\";   \\\ndone\n\n\nA: I have just came across this post while trying to export all item of a Photos library to then re-import them in another one to consolidate all I have in one library.\nUsing the default export unmodified original options, I realized that some items lose the \"date taken\" and so when re-imported they appears as if they are created today with the result of having all disorganized. I realized that most of those items are movies and stuff acquired from whatsapp. Looks like Photos has some metadata about those items that is not exporting in EXIF metadata.\nI solved all of this using this fantastic python tool:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos\nIt has many parameters to properly configure the export. Most usefull \"--exiftool \" that store exif information into the exported items.\n\nA: I use an application called A Better Finder Rename, with the preferences shown on the screenshot. The result is like: 2021-06-26 19.01.14.jpeg\nIt can read the original creation date from the jpeg's EXIF (so no worry, this information is not lost after you export from the Photos app). You can save a preset to a so called Droplet, then all you need to do is just drag and drop the images to the Droplet to make the bulk rename.\nIt can rename photos in complex folder hierarchy, hundreds or thousands images if you'd like.\nIf you prefer to use .jpg instead of .jpeg you can simply rename the file names, it doesn't matter on modern operating systems.\n\n\nA: I've been grappling with this issue for a while, and realized the easiest solution is not to \"export\" the photos at all, but rather to simply copy the originals, which are already grouped by date taken in \"Package Contents.\"\nRight click on the iPhoto library, and select \"Show Package Contents.\" Inside the hidden folder is a folder called \"Masters\" - all your images are there, sorted by date, with their original file names. Probably best to copy (rather than move) these to another folder, unless you want to discard everything in the library and start a new one afterwards.\n", "Q: Does putting an iOS device into single app mode prevent iOS upgrades? If I set an iOS device into single app mode via MDM, will the iOS update dialog still pop up? Is there a chance that the update can be launched while in single app mode?\n\nA: We block iOS updates via different ways on our iDevices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Via our Firewall, you can block these URLs on your WiFi network : mesu.apple.com, appldnld.apple.com. \n\n*Or you can block WiFi network on your devices via restrictions in a profile pushed by your MDM. So devices will be not able to download iOS updates, but you need to use only 3G/4G.\n\n\nA: If you setup single app mode on your iOS device, only those foreground processes are restricted from being showing up. All background processes, including the device downloading the device update, still works. I don't think there'll be pop-ups. If they do, then there is no point setting a device as single app mode because everyone has access to device update feature which might turn an app (set up in single app mode) incompatible with new version of iOS. Also consider, if single app mode is managed using an MDM software and remote access is not available (just in case) due to incompatibility issue of the MDM, which might be a huge problem.\nAnyway, I haven't checked this. I'll keep the answer updated when I do.\n", "Q: What is the angular velocity of the macOS beach ball?

I'm not sure what model it is or anything but the attached pictures show it.\nWhen it boots up there's a pixelated screen and it won't boot into the OS, and when I try to boot from a CD it says that the computer needs to restart. \n\n\n\nA: First, try to boot it off a different drive. It is possible (unlikely) that this is severe data corruption on the drive. You can use another Mac in target disk mode, or you can use internet recovery, or you can use a bootable external drive if you have one. \nIf you boot another drive and still have the graphic distortions then it is certainly a logic board issue. If it functions normally (this is not likely) then you just need a new hard drive, or maybe just a wipe and reinstall. It's unlikely but worth a shot. \n\nA: The model & serial numbers are on the underside of the foot. That doesn't have any bearing on the issues you're seeing- an inability to boot from its internal drive as well as a corrupted video signal showing a kernel panic screen- which is probably the result of a hardware failure in the display cable or connector or an issue with the system board video circuitry. \nAnother possibility is that the previous owner got a little too adventurous & mishandled disconnecting or reconnecting the front panel's display connector. Ifixit.com has instructions on how to open your model iMac so you can check the connectors for damage. \nYou may not have much recourse if you were not informed that the iMac was in this condition before you purchased it other than to have it repaired at your nearest Apple repair shop or Apple Store.\n", "Q: My icloud account was hacked, I changed the password, what else should I do? This morning I woke up just to find several messages sent to a Chinese number in my imessage app. I also found an email in my mail by Apple saying that someone had log in with my credential on an iMac (I don't own that).\nApple did good and blocked my account and asked me to change my password and I did so. The questions I have now are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I be worried? I have several password stored in my icloud keychain, are all of them compromised now? Should I change them all one by one? Are credit card details also compromised? \n\n\nA: Yes, if they activated \"Keychain\" using another device you should change your passwords.\nKeep in mind that activating \"Keychain\" in the iCloud preferences should require you to confirm the device using another device.\nPlease check to see how your account's authentication is currently set up (e.g. log out of your Apple ID on your Mac (iCloud), turn on iCloud using your Apple ID and try to activate \"Keychain\".

My macOS Sierra Installer isn't working, so I'd like to uninstall it in order to reinstall it later. The only problem is that I can't delete it directly because I don't have admin privileges on this computer. (I've also tried rm -r filename in Terminal.) How could I uninstall the installer without directly deleting it?\n\nA: There’s no uninstallation procedure. Despite the .app extension, Install macOS Sierra.app is essentially just a disk image waiting to be installed…no system modifications were made by merely downloading it, so deleting it is all that’s needed for removal. \nThat said, as Avery Chan mentioned, you still need sufficient privileges in order to remove it. \nThe command rm -r /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app won’t execute without prepending it with sudo. But using sudo requires an administrative, master, or root password...\nThe advisable solution is to ask the system administrator to remove it. That said, if this isn’t possible, a few workarounds exist:\nReset The Admin Password (note that if Filevault is enabled, this won’t work):\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into your Recovery Partition holding down command + R at the startup chime\n\n*Select Terminal from your Utilities Menu Bar\n\n*Enter resetpassword in the prompt. \n\n*From the window that appears, select your boot volume and the administrative account. \n\n*Type in a new password for the account. Confirm the new password.\n\n*Click Save, close this pane and quit Utilities\n\n*Select your boot volume when presented with \"choose startup disk\" and then reboot your machine.\n\n\nThat’ll allow you to access the admin account and subsequently delete the Installer. \nUse Single User mode (if Filevault is enabled or a firmware password is set, this won’t work either). While using this method will allow you to remove the file without resetting the admin’s password, it’s not advisable to make filesystem modifications at all in this manner, so proceed at your own risk. \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down command + S at the startup chime. After each of the following commands, hit enter.\n\n*Always run a disk check first in SU mode by typing in /sbin/fsck -fy. Don’t be alarmed by output such as “FILESYSTEM WAS MODIFIED”, that’s normal. It just means the filesystem was repaired. \n\n*Now, mount the boot volume with user write permissions. /sbin/mount -uw /\n\n*cd /Applications to migrate to the relevant directory. \n\n*Type in echo $(rm -rf Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app) before directly running it. Using actual backticks to nest the rm command is preferable to $(), I just can’t format it properly here. \n\n*Now proceed to remove the installer rm -rf Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\n*Type in reboot\n\nA: If you don't have admin priveleges, you won't be able to use the OS X Installer for Sierra. You should ask whoever has admin privileges to install Sierra for you.\n", "Q: How do I launch a file with the extension .darwin.amd64? How do I launch or open a file with the extension .darwin.amd64?\nDouble clicking it results in: \"There is no application available to open the document...\"\n\nA: If there is no file extension, then it is most likely Mach-O file format. This kind of files without file extension can be executed within terminal by dragging the file to the terminal window and pressing enter. Another way is to use terminal to cd into the directory containing the file, and executing ./filename.darwin.amd64, of course replace filename with your actual filename.\n", "Q: Lost Windows Bootcamp boot entry after resizing the partition I have a 2011 iMac that I had used Bootcamp utility to install Windows 7 on. I got overzealous and tried to triple boot Windows, Mac and Linux on the iMac. I no longer need Linux on this iMac but the process corrupted my boot table and now I can't boot into Windows. If I press and hold 'alt/option' key after it reboots it doesn't show me the Windows bootcamp boot entry -- just Mac and Recovery drive. \nHowever, in the file system, I still see all the files for Windows intact. So the file structure is still there, just the boot table entry is messed up somehow. I tried to 'repair' it but Bootcamp utility no longer gives me the optin of making a bootable Windows thumb drive using the Windows ISO that I have.

I was wondering if I could create a bootable thumb drive though. Bootcamp does not give me this option in the 2011 iMac but I was hoping to the edit the 'info.plist' in Bootcamp's contents folder to add my iMac model in there so that Bootcamp gives me the option of booting from thumb drive. This \"patch\" is described here: Bootcamp - No ISO Option\nBut is there any other simpler way to create a bootable thumb drive to install Windows on a Mac?\n\nA: There are ways to create a bootable Windows installer thumb drive. The problem is you can not use this thumb drive with your computer. The software that searches the USB ports for bootable flash drives is part of the the firmware located on the main logic board. This firmware is not part of the OS X (macOS) operating system. Even though the firmware for the 2011 iMac can boot OS X (macOS) and certain Linux versions from a thumb drive, the Windows 7 installer can not be booted this way. The best option is to use original internal optical (DVD) drive. I would recommend a RW DVD which takes longer to burn, but is reusable.  \nIf the Windows partition is intact, there are three main reasons you can not boot Windows. These reasons are listed below and apply to Mac computers which are booting Windows using the BIOS method.\n\n\n*\n\n*The values in the partition tables are wrong. There are two partition\ntables. The first is the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) table and\nthe second is the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT). The bootable\nWindows partition must exist in both of these tables. The MBR table is stored at the beginning of the drive, followed by the GPT header and array of partition entries. There is also a backup copy of this GPT header and array at the end of the drive.\n\n*The MBR does not contain the correct code needed to boot Windows. The\nBIOS boot methods reads at least the first 512 bytes stored on the\nboot drive into memory and execute the code contained in this 512\nbytes. These bytes are referred to as the MBR which also contains the\nMBR table. This code reads the MBR table and determines which\npartition to boot Window from. If this code is missing or incorrect,\nWindows will not boot.\n\n*Finally, the Windows Boot Configuration Data (BCD) is missing or\ncontains the wrong data. If a change is made to your computer or if\nthe Windows partition is moved regardless if within the same or to\ndifferent computer, the BCD may need to be corrected or simply\nrecreated. As far as I know, this can only be done (without using a\nthird party tool) by booting from proper Windows installation media.\nIn your case this would be a DVD containing the Windows installation\nsoftware.\n\n\nThe output from the fdisk command shows the MBR table contains some incorrect values. This output should have appeared as shown below.\nusers-iMac:~ user$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 121601/255/63 [1953525168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] <Unknown ID>\n 2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 - 1168862256] HFS+        \n 3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1169271896 -    1269536] Darwin Boot \n*4: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1170541432 -  782721552] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n\nBasically, your forth partition (where Windows resides) has the wrong id (partition type) and is not flaged as active (bootable). \nThe MBR table can be corrected by using the fdisk command.

Example: bootcamp volume becomes no longer recognized as \"bootcamp\", re-partition the drive into Macintosh HD and Bootcamp (NFTS). Install MacOS as per normal, then restore bootcamp image to the new bootcamp partition.\nThere are several suggestions on how to modify the partition table without reformatting and repartitioning. However, in my own attempts I have yet to find a consistently reproducible method.\nFinally, if you do not have a current bootcamp partition image (such as with Acronis True Image), you might find a solution to create an image by finding the NFTS partitioned drive sectors via linux GParted.

Ltd.. I've never used their product(s), so I have no idea if they work. YMMV.\n", "Q: What is CalNCService and why does it run hot in macOS Sierra? Since the upgrade to macOS Sierra I occasionally see a service CalNCService running hot (i.e. on 100% CPU).  So going from the name, this seems to be some Calendar Service. I tried disabling Calendars in Internet Accounts Preferences, but this was no help.  One can kill the service or restart the computer, but the problem persists.  Usually, after a few hours or so it goes back to normal.\nWhat is this daemon doing? How can I debug this issue?\nUpdate: In the log console I find this when calNCService starts up:\nwarning: dynamic accessors failed to find @property implementation for 'serialNumber' for entity ABCDAddressBookSource while resolving selector 'serialNumber' on class 'ABCDAddressBookSource'.  Did you remember to declare it @dynamic or @synthesized in the @implementation ?\n\nUpdate2: The Service is connected to syncing reminders.  Disabling reminder sync under Internet Accounts makes the service go back to normal, enabling it again makes it go back to 100%.  This seems independent of the server. I have a bunch of recurring reminders and first had this problem with my account on fruux.com. Then I migrated all to iCloud and now its the same there.\nUpdate3: Still very present in 10.12.1. and no reply on Apple Support Communities.\nUpdate4: Another morning, another calNCService.  I have also manually checked the exported .ics of the offending reminder list.  It looks totally harmless.  About 40 Reminders with nothing special in them. \nUpdate 5: Still all the same in 10.12.2\nUpdate 6: Confirmed in 10.12.4. Iterating: This seems to be some housekeeping task. When I activated the reminders after the upgrade the problem was not triggered for more than 24h. But now it is back. As before, it can be simply stopped by deactivating reminder sync under \"Internet Accounts\"\nUpdate 7: The bug seems to be still present in MacOS 10.13 High Sierra, it is less severe, though. I have been letting the corresponding reminders account activated. During an uptime of 13 days CalNCService clocked in a CPU time of 1:07:01 (31h), way too much, but less than e.g. \"kernel task\" (7:16:16).\nUpdate 8: Still present in 10.13.4. I have two machines with MacOS and it happens on both of them. It seems to be connected to reminders added via some API such when you add reminders via Launchbar.  The CPU time of calNCService seems to be correlated with how much I use Launchbar or Siri to enter reminders.\n\nA: I had similar problem. CalNCService was consuming enormous amount of CPU. Here is how to reproduce on my side:\nI am using iPhone SE with iOS 11.1.2 and a MacBook with macOS High Sierra on the same Wi-Fi. I got a call on my phone, but I just did not accept it via Remind Later. After around 50 mins, I noticed my MacBook gone crazy.\nThe fix was to delete that call reminder from my phone, then MacBook cooled down immediately.\n\nA: I first noticed this issue immediately after the very first time I created a reminder using Siri on my Mac (running High Sierra). Deleting this reminder made CalNCService behave right away.\nI then recreated the same reminder without Siri, and CalNCService did not start acting up. So in my case it seems to be linked to creating a reminder with Siri on the Mac.\n\nA: I had same problem (fans at full throttle, CalNCService at 122% of CPU) and have made 2 visits to Apple store and 3rd visit I checked in the Mac for a warranty repair (replaced both fans)...  Yet the problem continues.\nI went into notifications > edit and disabled all notifications, badges, sounds, etc, except for iMessage, Slack and Outlook.  \nAbout 3 minutes later, I noticed.... silence.  Fans are normal.  I'll watch it for a while, but it seems this issue is definitely related to something in notifications.  I won't miss being pinged all day long. \n\nA: Definitely works, even before restarting:\n\nOn your own risk!

Looks by the blog date like this predates Sierra:   https://robert.accettura.com/blog/2012/08/19/how-to-stop-calendaragent-from-eating-cpu/ \n\nA: I unsubscribed to a german holiday calendar in my Calendar App. That worked immediately and the fans have gone silently again. I suppose this subscription in this calendar app was the problem. Hope that will help someone.\n\nA: I simply removed the due dates from all my overdue reminders, and CalNCService’s CPU usage immediately went back to normal.\nThese repeating console logs had prompted me to try this:\nUpdating overdue reminder count\nScheduling next update for Tue Feb 18 09:00:00 2020, which is -3409.498367 seconds from now\nPerforming action for fired timer with label ReminderBadgeUpdate\n\nThis was on macOS 10.14.6 Mojave.\n\nA: In my case issue was resolved by deleting a CalDAV account in Internet Accounts System Preference panel.  This account was configured to sync Reminders.  If you're experiencing this issue I recommend checking Internet Accounts pane and disabling any items that are attempting to sync reminders.\n~ Rodney \n\nA: You can just restart CalendarAgent in Activity Monitor.

I recently needed to install Paraview, but ran into some problems I still couldn't resolve.\nWhen installing Paraview 5.1.2 from it's .dmg file by moving the icon onto the Application folder, it ends up in /Applications. For this installation I used the only local account stsadmin, which surprisingly is an admin account. I can start the application, so everything seems to be fine.\nWhen I log in with another account, which in our case are network accounts, I can't open Paraview. \n\nYou do not have permissions to open the application \"paraview\".\n\nI then checked the permissions:\n$ ls -adl /Applications/paraview.app/\ndrwx------  3 stsadmin  admin  102 Jul 27 02:30 /Applications/paraview.app/\n\nWhen I look at some other apps like VLC, this app belongs to root/wheel instead of stsadmin/admin. \nQuestions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this problem caused by paraview? Or did I use the wrong installation process?\n\n*How to fix it? chown? chgrp? If so, what is the correct user/group?\n\n\nA: There is nothing wrong with your installation method. A lot of apps are intended to be installed by just simply dropping the app on the Applications folder.\nNow either the packager/creator of the application bundle in the dmg made a mistake or the permissions of the bundle are deliberate.\nTo allow other users to use the app, modifying the permissions with the following command should be sufficient:\nsudo chmod -R u=rwx,go=rx /Applications/paraview.app \n\n", "Q: Mac mini Late 2014 Has anyone tried upgrading the soldered RAM on the Late 2014 Mac mini?\nMy boss bought me this Mac as a development machine, with 4GiB RAM, and it's really just not cutting it.\nThe hard drive is fine, I can live with 500GB, as I upload most of my stuff to our Git servers, and it's all fine; the RAM, however, is a real bottleneck. I can't keep my applications open to debug them correctly: with my browser, IDE(s), file editors, and application open, my Mac is usually running up in the 3,7-3,8GiB RAM section, which slows this thing down tremendously.\nAt home, I have the same Mac, however, I don't develop at home. At all. My Mac at home works just fine, for watching films, and TV, creating basic HTML sites (templates), and using MS Office.\nI need a way to get more fast memory in to this Mac, otherwise I can't work properly.\nAny help with this matter is much appreciated!\n\nA: Nope, you can't upgrade the memory on the Mac mini, it's soldered together. I really don't think it is easy to solder the memory and there are really high chance that you will break the machine. The best way for you right now is to tell your boss to get a better computer (8GB of RAM is fine but I recommend 16GB or more).\n", "Q: Can applications be using mic/camera without permission? Normally when an application on iPhone or iPad needs to access the microphone or camera it should get permission from the user.  \nConsidering applications for iOS distributed through AppStore,\nif such an application never asked for permission, and isn't listed in the privacy tab in Settings, is it guaranteed that the application can't access the microphone or camera?\n\nA: Unless it's a hacked system, then no, it will not have access since access is only possible via API's that require granting access. \n\nA: In the event of a hack it's assumed that the system you mention has been overcome in some fashion. It's also assumed that the hackers find a way to turn the LED light off alongside the camera. \nNotably, none of this has happened yet on a Mac. It's just that a handful of headlines were generated by people saying it's possible. \n", "Q: Rsync to macOS Sierra fails I have a directory in my Ubuntu computer with the following sub directories:\nemacs.d/el-get/python-mode/\n├── extensions\n├── EXTENSIONS\n├── INSTALL\n├── INSTALL-INFO-FILES\n├── ...\n└── website\n\nWhen I rsync to macOS, I get an error:\nrecv_files: \"emacs.d/el-get/python-mode/EXTENSIONS\" is a directory\n\nApparently, macOS creates extensions and then can not create EXTENSIONS. It seems macOS is case insensitive? Is there any way to solve this problem? Can I tell macOS to be case sensitive for the File System?\n\nA: As Mark mentioned in his comment, \"You can make the drive case sensitive but then some apps will not work\" and Matteo showing you a list from Disk Utility, let me offer you an alternative to changing the format of the existing physical volume.\nI use a sparse bundle (.sparsebundle) formatted as Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled) to maintain a case sensitive volume that's accessible on my Mac. It could also be a sparse or regular disk image file (.sparseimage/.dmg) vs. the sparse bundle, whichever suits your needs better.\nIn macOS Sierra's Disk Utility, click File > New Image > Blank Image... then in the settings sheet you can define the properties of the image file.\nYou can have it mount automatically when you login by adding it to your Login Items (System Preferences > User & Groups > $USER > Login Items).\nNote that I use the sparse bundle because I find its easier to compact using hdiutil compact filename.sparsebundle to regain disk space as needed because it uses 8 MiB bands vs. a single file, which works better when the physical disk is getting to full.\n\nA: In Sierra but also in previous system you can choose to format the drive as case sensitive or case insensitive. Default is case insensitive.\nThe issue is not specific to Sierra but on how the partition is formatted:\n\n", "Q: Are locked notes in the Notes.app are encrypted on the local host? Anyone has a clue? I know they are encrypted on the servers, but I would like to know if they are also particularly encrypted on my machine. Thanks!\n\nA: All user data on iOS devices is automatically encrypted. This includes any data stored in the Notes app.\nData on Mac computers is not encrypted by default, unless the individual app encrypts its data storage. It appears that data is stored in an unencrypted SQLite database, based on the fact there's a third-party export tool available.\n\nA: It is unnecessary as encryption is to protect data from \"interception\" while be moved between device and server or while on server.\nYour protection of notes on your device is your passcode / fingerprint.\nLearn more at:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303\n", "Q: Why does my Apple Watch keep entering Power Reserve mode? I updated to Watch OS3 last week, and now my Apple Watch keeps entering Power Reserve mode, even when I have plenty of power on it!  As it sits right now, I have 87% power, and it has already entered Power Reserve three or four times today!  I did not ask it to go there, and it has enough power.  Has anyone had this problem, and if so, how did you resolve it?\n\nA: Someone (I don't recall who, and I'm surprised their comment isn't here - whoever you are, thanks!) suggested that it could be the Battery complication, which I really like for monitoring battery status.  However, when you touch it, it presents a big percentage display and a very large button that covers the bottom of the watch face; touching this button puts the watch in Power Reserve mode!\n\nThe problem is that I had the Battery complication at the bottom right, so two touches in that corner results in Power Reserve mode!  At first I thought I had to give up the Battery complication, but then I realized that by putting it in the upper left corner, I avoid the simple two touches in one corner; now, in order to put it in Reserve mode, you have to touch two distinct, separate areas.  It has now not gone into Reserve mode since then!\nOf course, it would be even nicer to have a Battery complication that just shows the battery status, without causing this nasty behavior...\n", "Q: Battery efficient GPS/Sat Nav app I'm looking for a battery efficient satellite navigation app for use on my bike. The problem is that GPS apps are a huge drain on the battery. My iPhone 6S lasts just under 3 hours when running Google Maps.\nYears ago, I remember some app that had the feature of dimming the screen in between navigation instructions. I've checked Apple Maps, Google Maps and Waze and these do not appear to have the feature I describe. \nDoes anyone know of a good GPS/Sat Nav app that is gentle on the battery?\n\nA: The solution I took in the end involves turning off the screen when riding on my bike. The audio navigation instructions still come through on my Bluetooth earpiece, and the instructions are accurate even if my phone is in my pocket. \nNow I get to ride without anything cluttering up my handlebars, and my phone lasts long enough for the journeys I make. \n", "Q: Can I encrypt an external hard disc that is used for backup and is also bootable? I have an external hard disk that serves two purposes:\n\n\n*\n\n*It contains a fully functional bootable macOS installation for use should my main installation of macOS become corrupt in some way.\n\n*Since it's a 1TB disk and macOS takes only 20GB, I use the remaining space to back up folders by manually copying them over in Finder. I don't use Time Machine.\nI'm thinking of encrypting this external disk, from Disk Utility (when booted from the main copy of macOS — on my internal drive).\nIf I do so, will both installations of macOS be able to decrypt it? Or should I leave it unencrypted if I want it to work in both the roles mentioned above?\nI'm running Sierra, in case it matters.\n\nA: Another \"less work\" idea:\nUse CarboCopyCloner or SuperDuper! to clone your internal disk to the external disk from time to time: it will be an exact copy of the internal disk and bootable: the OS is up to date and configured as the internal disk, and your files ditto.\n\nA: You can unlock the disk while booted from other partitions. You'll be prompted for a password when mounting the disk. You can choose to save the password in your keychain if you prefer.\nAlso, you can just right-click on the volume in the Finder and select Encrypt \"Disk Name\", it's the same as using Disk Utility.\n", "Q: Mac shuts down during startup I'll be short and sweet. \nMy hardware: \n\n\n*\n\n*Mid-2010 13\" MacBook Pro \n\n*P8800 2.66GHz Core2duo \n\n*8GB aftermarket RAM\n\n*750GB aftermarket Seagate Momentus HDD @ 7200RPM\n\n\nMy software:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Sierra Public Beta (latest version). \n\n\nThe computer was feeling very sluggish last night, having trouble loading simple webpages (it spent 5mn on google.com) - so I force shut it down using the power button in order to start it back up (it sometimes goes a bit slow after a few days of uptime). \nWhen I booted it up again, it got stuck at 95% of the grey startup progress bar, and hung there.

Do you guys agree? Did I miss anything in my troubleshooting process?\nAlso, since this lappy is my only macOS device, I am currently stumped as to how to get a bootable installer for Sierra. I only have access to Windows machines. Any advice on this front?\nAlso, if it turns out my drive is indeed fried, what are my options for recovering that which is still recoverable? \nThanks a lot in advance!\n-Karim \n\nA: First Aid failing and a locked HD means your HD is failing. \nYou should boot into internet recovery, and install OS X on an external HD. (Since you don't have another Mac). Then, boot from the external HD and backup any important files from your internal HD. I'd recommend getting a new HD or SSD and installing it into your machine.\n\nA: If, as you suspect, the drive is dying, I'd swap in a new drive so as not to hammer that one unnecessarily.\nThen you can use Internet Recovery to put the original OS it shipped with back onto the new drive, update to Sierra & then concentrate on the old drive. Drop it in a USB enclosure & mount as an external.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use an iPhone 5 with tracfone service byop? I am trying to use an iPhone 5 with Tracfone's byop.

But I was only using c. 400gb, 400gb, 500gb respectively. \nI've now resized the partitions to make better use of the space but want to now make one large c 2.7tb partition out of the remaining space. But I can't seem to combine the empty spaces, is this possible? \nI've attached a screenshot for reference. \n\n\nA: What you want to do can be done without using any third party tools. Basically you need move the last two partition to a position after the first partition. The fact that the source and destinations overlap complicates the procedure. This means you may need to move a partition twice. First to the bottom of the drive, then to a position after the first partition. For example, below is sparse bundle from which I can use to expose the necessary steps.\n\nFirst, I created a new partition at the end of the drive.\n\nNext, I restored the second partition source \"MAX DL OLD TBC\" to the forth partition destination \"SL yosemite 2\".\n\nNext, I removed the second partition \"MAX DL OLD TBC\".\n\nNext, I created a new partition about the same size as the original \"MAX DL OLD TBC\". The default volume label was \"4 TB HD 2 1\".\n\nNext, I restored the forth partition source \"MAX DL OLD TBC\" to the second partition destination \"4 TB HD 2 1\".\n\nSince there is enough free space, I created new partition after the second partition. This partition is about the same size as the \"SL yosemite\" partition.\n\nNext, I restored the forth partition source \"SL yosemite\" to the third partition destination \"MAX DL OLD TBC 2 1\".\n\nFinally, I removed the last two partitions.\n\n\nNote: Occasionally, the Disk Utility application would become confused and not correctly display the results after executing a particular step. Therefore, I needed to quit the and relaunch the Disk Utility application between certain steps. Also, a few times I need to unmount and remount the disk image.\n\nEl Capitan users would probably be better off using the command line to create and remove the partitions. This can be done by using the command diskutil. Also, the gpt command can be useful. The Disk Utility application can still be used to copy the partitions.\n\nA: You have two possibilities:\ndd (or asr) and CoreStorage.\nUsing one of the first two you have to create equally sized partitions on the disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an exact duplicate of \"MAX DL OLD TBC\" (with all data!) right after  \"4TB\" in the 600 GB gap. Delete the old  \"MAX DL OLD TBC\".\n\n*Create an exact duplicate of \"SL yosemite\" (with all data!) right after the \"moved\" \"MAX DL OLD TBC\". Delete the old  \"SL yosemite\".\n\n*Now create a new ~2.7 TB partition in the now unfragmented unallocated disk space\n\n\nYou can also use CoreStorage to create a new \"virtual disk\" in the fragmented unallocated disk space:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create three new empty volumes in the three unallocated disk slices and rename them to CS1, CS2 and CS3\n\n*Open Terminal and enter diskutil list\nExample:\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *68.7 GB    disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS 4TB                     13.9 GB    disk1s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS CS1                     6.8 GB     disk1s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS MAX DL OLD TBC          12.0 GB    disk1s4\n   5:                  Apple_HFS CS2                     5.7 GB     disk1s5\n   6:                  Apple_HFS SL yosemite             7.2 GB     disk1s6\n   7:                  Apple_HFS CS3                     22.1 GB    disk1s7\n\nYour disk identifiers may be different of course.\n\n*Create a Logical Volume Group with CS1, CS2 and CS3:\ndiskutil cs create CSName disk1s3 disk1s5 disk1s7\n\nwith the following output:\nStarted CoreStorage operation\nUnmounting disk1s3\nTouching partition type on disk1s3\nAdding disk1s3 to Logical Volume Group\nUnmounting disk1s5\nTouching partition type on disk1s5\nAdding disk1s5 to Logical Volume Group\nUnmounting disk1s7\nTouching partition type on disk1s7\nAdding disk1s7 to Logical Volume Group\nCreating Core Storage Logical Volume Group\nSwitching disk1s3 to Core Storage\nSwitching disk1s5 to Core Storage\nSwitching disk1s7 to Core Storage\nWaiting for Logical Volume Group to appear\nDiscovered new Logical Volume Group \"A55DDC31-D290-4A66-8D49-B83877A01001\"\nCore Storage LVG UUID: A55DDC31-D290-4A66-8D49-B83877A01001\nFinished CoreStorage operation\n\n\n*In the Core Storage LVG create a new Logical Volume with:\ndiskutil cs createVolume lvgUUID type name size\n\nWith the data above and one LV spanning the whole LVG that's:\ndiskutil cs createVolume A55DDC31-D290-4A66-8D49-B83877A01001 jhfs+ LVName 100%\n\nThe result of diskutil listis then:\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *68.7 GB    disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS 4TB                     13.9 GB    disk1s2\n   3:          Apple_CoreStorage CSname                  6.8 GB     disk1s3\n   4:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s9\n   5:                  Apple_HFS MAX DL OLD TBC          12.0 GB    disk1s4\n   6:          Apple_CoreStorage CSname                  5.7 GB     disk1s5\n   7:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s10\n   8:                  Apple_HFS SL yosemite             7.2 GB     disk1s6\n   9:          Apple_CoreStorage CSname                  22.1 GB    disk1s7\n  10:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s11\n/dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS LVName                 +29.1 GB    disk2\n                                 Logical Volume on disk1s3, disk1s5, ...\n                                 06D80216-2EFD-43F4-A5D4-755F8D703DF1\n                                 Unencrypted Fusion Drive\n\nThe three former volumes CS1-CS3 will be \"replaced\" by \"LVname\" on your desktop.\n\nThe downside of the first method is the requirement to copy ~ 0.9 TB of data.

A Thunderbolt cable has a Thunderbolt-connector on every end. A Thunderbolt-connector follows the Mini Displayport specifications and should be usable between Apple devices as such.\nWhen I connect a Thunderbolt cable from my 2015 MacBook Pro (i7 4890k, AMD M370X, 16 GB, 512 GB) to my 4K-display (Acer S277HK), the display powers down immediately and I can't power it back up again until I've removed the Thunderbolt cable. Is this normal behaviour? Is the problem in the cable, the display or the display's mini displayport connector? Or are Thunderbolt cables generally not supposed to function as Mini Displayport to Mini Displayport cables?\n\nA: No.  You cannot use a Thunderbolt cable to connect to a mini Display Port (mDP) monitor.\nThe reason you are seeing the monitor shut off is because you are sending it Thunderbolt AND Display Port signaling.  Remember, Display Port is, for a lack of a better word, embedded within the Thunderbolt signal.\n\nJust using pin 1 for example, the Display is expecting ground while TB is sending HV Input.  \nThis is why you need a mini Display port cable when hooking up a monitor and a Thunderbolt cable when hooking up a Thunderbolt device.\n", "Q: Creating an icon for a homebrew installed software (evince) - Mac OS X I installed Evince, the famous PDF reader that comes pre-installed with several major GNU/Linux distributions, on Mac OS X using \n brew install evince\n\nnow, to open it, I have to type every single time \"evince\" on terminal.\nIs there any way to create an icon for that program, that could be moved in my applications folder?\n\nA: Simply use a wrapper like Platypus\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install the script wrapper Platypus. \n\n*Create a shell script /usr/local/bin/evince.sh with the content\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/local/bin/evince\n\n\n*Open Platypus and create a new app like indicated in the screenshot below:\n\n\n*Choose a nice icon (1024 x 1024 px linked) like this one:\n (48 x 48 px example)\nand hit the create button\n\n*Save the app to an appropriate folder (e.g. /Applications) and create a Dock item \n\n\nA: Try linking apps with this command:\nbrew linkapps evince\n\nIf there are .app-style macOS wrapper apps in its formula, it will be linked to /Applications.

Digital Color Meter reports the color as #FEDC53.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Broken Colors?</title>\n</head>\n<body style=\"background-color: #FFDD44\">\nHello, World!\n</body>\n</html>\n\nIs Safari displaying the incorrect color? Or is Digital Color Meter displaying reading the wrong color? How do I find out? How do I fix this?\n\nComparative true FFDD44 swatch, with sRGB profile embedded.\n\n\nA: What's happening is that Digital Color Meter (and all color droppers) is reading the color value AFTER it has been adjusted for your display's ICC Color Profile. See how it shows \"Color LCD\" in the bottom right box? Despite the generic sounding name, that is the ICC Color Profile specifically for Macbooks. \nHere's a data flow diagram:\n#FFDD44 (original)\n   ↓\n#FEDC53 (adjusted for Color LCD display profile)\n\nThe term \"Display native values\" is misleading because it sounds like it's going to display the original values, but it doesn't. Apparently, color droppers cannot get the original values. So there are 2 solutions:\n1. Quick and dirty solution\nChange Digital Color Meter to \"Display in sRGB\" mode. What that does is re-convert the adjusted value to sRGB (assuming that's what the color space of the original image is). The problem with this is due to the double conversion and rounding errors, sometimes you will not get the exact original value back! (In this case, it was the same, but if you try more colors, you'll find some that are slightly off).\n#FFDD44 (original)\n   ↓\n#FEDC53 (adjusted for Color LCD display profile)\n   ↓\n#FFDD44 (convert back to sRGB)\n\n2. Exact solution\nIf you want to guarantee the exact original values, you should set Digital Color Meter to \"Display native values\", then change your System Preferences > Displays > Color > sRGB. Verify that Digital Color Meter now shows \"sRGB...\" in the lower right box. Since that matches the color space of the original source, no adjustment will be made, so \"Display native values\" will always be the exact original values. (You should remember to change it back to \"Color LCD\" afterwards. Or if you don't care, leave it in \"sRGB\".)\n#FFDD44 (original)\n\n(no adjustment since display profile sRGB matches the original color space)\n\nSee this answer for more details.\n\nA: Digital Color Monitor is working correctly.\nI created your test page and displayed it in Google Chrome v53.0.2785.143, and it reported FFDD44.\nThe same page in Safari reported, for me, F4E14F. Looking at them next to each other, they don't even look like the same color. (In the screenshot, Chrome is the outer window, Safari the inner.)\n\nIt appears that the reason is gamma correction in the browser. See the Gamma Test Page. This page displays correctly (in the sense that each block is a solid color) in Safari v9.1.3, whereas it displays incorrectly in Chrome v53.0.2785.143. See screenshots below. Based on the information on the Gamma Test Page, Safari is correctly gamma-correcting CSS colors.\n\n\n", "Q: External hard drive with iPhoto library doesn't open My son pulled out the USB cable while iPhoto was running from the external hard drive and a message came up when I plugged it back in that said there were inconsistencies that needed to be repaired.

My compass is often wrong, which leads to all directional modes of maps being wrong (very annoying for back country trail following).   In old versions of iOS I remember the 'figure 8' popping up sometimes, but you don't see that anymore, nor have I found a way to determine if my compass is calibrated or not, other than checking the width of the blue cone in the Apple Maps app when you are in compass mode (it seems to get narrower as the compass is more accurate).\nIs there any way to force recalibration in iOS 10, and/or see further information about current accuracy?\n\nA: In troubleshooting this, I learned a few important things:\n\n\n*\n\n*While there is no way to manually force a recalibration of the compass aside from toggling location services on and off, generally the compass attempts to recalibrate itself when an app requests it if it has not been in use.\n\n*The 'blue cone' in maps seems to be the best way to easily tell how accurate the calibration things it is.\n\n*Arguably most importantly (and most embarrassingly), my issues were entirely caused by a case that I was using that had a small magnetic clasp in it.  Everything worked just great after getting rid of it.\n\nA: Toggling the location services on/off a couple of times worked for me.\n\nA: I found an answer from another site that worked instantly with my iPhone SE: \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold phone flat, face up in front of you (on the palm of your hand)\n\n*Move the phone in a figure of eight motion (by tilting your wrist)\n\n*While making this repetitive movement, the compass will reorient itself.\n\n\nA: I gave up and decided to delete it. I pushed and held it down to get it into delete mode, but it would not go. BUT, that ended up reorienting it!\n\nA: The figure eight movement described by Trevor worked for me.   I had two iphones side by side for comparison and mine was off by 90° until I recalibrated. \n\nA: Go to true north settings. Go to settings and change it will resolve \n\nA: No one should ever use a smartphone to navigate back country, ever. Carry a real compass and the appropriate map(s). An actual compass and a map are not battery dependent, and they are accurate. The compass feature and trail navigation apps are gimmicks and are a recipe for disaster. I have worked Land Surveying since 1976 and have done extensive back country treks in the Rockies, Cascades, Chugach (Alaska) Mountains and some in the Bavarian Alps. My adult daughter, a few years ago, went on a hike with me in the Catskills, where we compared the compass and land nav app in her iphone to old school map and compass - the iphone was so far off, it boggles my mind that anyone would actually use this.  \nI then decided to test the accuracy of the smartphone compass by aligning it to a random direction and taking note of the reading and marking a line on a piece of paper on which the phone was sitting, without moving the paper, but turning the iphone and compass 90 degrees, I struck another line, turned another 90 degrees, struck a line, and repeated once more. This gave me the original line and then three others which were supposed to be all right angles. Using a protractor to measure the actual angles turned, I found that not ONE of these angles were perpendicular, moreover, the first and second were not 180 degrees out, nor were the 2nd and 4th lines stuck at 180 degrees to each other. The variations were anywhere from around 15 degrees to 30 degrees in error! \nSo, should anyone want to go hiking, use a real compass and a real map to navigate. Use the smart phone as phone.\n", "Q: Icons in App store display blurred I did a clean install on macOS Sierra 10.12 on my MacBook Air 13.3\" early 2015 and found out that most of the icons in App Store are blurred.\nSearched the web for a bit, finding references saying that this issue may be caused by the app developers who forgot to update the icon to better image quality. Some references also suggest deleting applications and downloading them again in order for the icons to be updated. Also no custom fonts were installed on this machine.\nThese references do not really apply to my case, because blurred icons are in the App Store itself and app developer is Apple. Have a look on the attached images:\n\n\nI am guessing that my MacBook Air supports only up to 1440x900 resolution with 128 dpi and icons were designed to support higher dpi screens. That sounds a bit ridiculous.\nWhat are you thoughts guys?

Is there a way to use an iPhone as an external monitor for a computer?\nI'm particularly interested in the potential of using an iPhone with Google Cardboard as a VR device.  But instead of using it just with iPhone apps, I'd like to be able to use it with programs that run on my computer.\nI've never seen anything that allows an iPhone to be an external display, but that's what I'm looking for.\n\nA: Assuming I understand your question correctly, you want to use a device such as an iPhone as an extra display for your desktop computer. If so, you will need to use 3rd party software to do this, such as Duet Display. \nI have used this app to set an iPad up as an external monitor for an iMac and it works well for some workflows. How well it works for you will depend on what you're trying to do and the hardware you're using.\nIn any case, I know that Duet Display works with both iPads and iPhones and works with both Mac and Windows.

It gets the Apple logo, gets past the progress bar, and then gets stuck on the grey screen for about two minutes before rebooting itself. However, what makes this odd is that I can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the iMac in Target Disk Mode and use it to successfully boot up other Macs. In doing so everything seems to work perfectly fine.\n\n*Successfully boot the iMac from an external drive and everything seems to work perfectly fine.\n\n\nLong story\nI was presented this iMac about 2 weeks ago as it refused to bootup. That is, it would commence booting up and cycle through the Apple logo and progress bar, but after the progress bar completed it would remain on the grey screen for a couple of minutes before rebooting itself and doing the same thing all over again. \nTo address this I undertook the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting SMC - failed\n\n*Resetting NVRAM - failed\n\n*Starting up in Safe Mode - failed\n\n*Starting up in OS X Recovery Mode – failed\n\n*Starting up in OS X Recovery Mode via the internet – failed\n\n*Undertook an extensive hardware test using Apple Hardware Test (AHT 3A213) - passed\n\n*Started iMac in Target Disk Mode and retested hard drive using Scannerz on another iMac - passed\n\n*Started iMac in Target Disk Mode and reformatted the hard drive and did a clean install of Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 - successful\n\n*Migrated data from a Time Machine backup - successful\nAfter these steps I tested the iMac for four days with no issues in terms of booting up and using the computer. On the fifth day I needed to manually import seven Apple Mail mailboxes. I did these one by one and six of them imported within minutes.\nThe last mailbox was showing as being 270 GB in size. I knew this was inaccurate, but I decided to import the mailbox so I could do a mailbox rebuild to correct whatever corruption had taken place. This import took over 12hrs to do but seemed to work fine and Mail was displaying the emails.\nI then tested the iMac on and off for another day to ensure it had no problems booting up. This was successful.\nI then decided to initiate the mailbox rebuild, but as soon as I did the screen went black and stayed that way regardless of any keyboard shortcuts I tried using. I waited an hour, forced a reboot, and ever since the iMac has returned to its original behaviour of not booting up – it would get past the progress bar and stay on the grey screen for a while before rebooting itself and starting the whole vicious cycle again.\nI have again retested the hard drive, processor, RAM and Video Ram by starting the iMac from an external hard drive and using a combination of the following packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Hardware Test (AHT 3A213)\n\n*Scannerz\n\n*TechTool Pro\n\n*Memtester (under the Homebrew subsystem)\n\n\nAnd now I have a situation where I can boot the iMac from external hard drives, and also use it in target disk mode to boot up other Macs, but cannot use it to boot from its own internal drive.\nAt present I have isolated the internal hard drive and am running a scan to check for any malware. \nIn the meantime, I am wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone come across a similar scenario and, if so, what was the cause?\n\n*Assuming I find no malware, do I go through the reformat/clean install/migration process again, but this time not import the last\nmailbox and see whether the iMac works fine?\n\n*Any other suggestions?\niMac specs are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (27”, mid 2011)\n\n*3.1 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*8 GB RAM\n\n*AMD Radeon HD 6970M 1024 MB\n\n*1 TB 3.5” SATA HD\n\n*Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\n\n\nA: I'm answering my own question in the unlikely event it helps someone else, although I suspect this odd behaviour could result from a number of possible hardware issues or a sensor error.\nI started to suspect something wasn't quite right with the display so I connected the iMac to an external display and for the first time in about five days the computer booted up from the internal hard drive. Oddly enough both the internal screen and external screen worked fine while using the computer.\nI then disconnected the external screen and the problem returned - the iMac would not boot from the internal drive. Reconnecting the external screen results in everything working fine. I went through this disconnect/reconnect process five times and the results were repeatable.\nWhile connected to the external screen I was able to import and rebuild the corrupt mailbox with the end result being a 258 Gb reduction in the mailbox size!\nAs far as I can tell, both the LCD panel and the internal DisplayPort cable are fine, so I'm recommending to my friend that she run it connected to an external display for a while to determine if any other problems present themselves. While I could inspect and reseat internal DisplayPort cable, this is not something I intend to do unless she reports back that the internal display stops working.\nI will update this answer if/when I have anything else useful to share.\n[Update]\nEventually the iMac stopped booting altogether - only getting part of the way before restarting itself in an endless loop. Also the display would show vertical lines etc, so the owner bought another 27\" model and gave me this to use for parts.\nAfter having it in my office for a few months and not needing any of the parts, I decided to disassemble it to see if I could find any obvious fault. Nothing stood out at me so I decided that since I had gone to all this trouble, I may as well remove the GPU (an AMD Radeon HD 6970M 1024 MB) and bake it in the oven to try and re-flow the solder and heat the Bumps under the surface-mount chip. (Basically I had decided a while back that the GPU was the most likely culprit).\nAfter doing this and reassembling everything the iMac booted up normally. It was the first time this year it had booted successfully! I've since rebooted it 30+ times, run Apple Hardware Test, and so on. Not sure how long this will last (the baking a GPU in the oven trick is often described as a temporary fix, but Ive heard of GPUs still working normally six months later.\nFor anyone who is interested, below is a brief summary of what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disassemble the iMac enough to remove the GPU\n\n*Set oven to 205℃ (400℉)\n\n*Place a sheet of baking paper on an oven tray and place the GPU (only the GPU itself) on the oven tray\n\n*Place it in the oven for 8 minutes\n\n*Remove the tray and let it cool\n\n*Remove any old heatsink compound from the chips and replace with new compound\n\n*Reassemble everything \n\n\nThis process took me approximately 4.5hrs (including various interruptions along the way).\nObviously the steps above do not go into detail, so anyone reading this who feels confident enough to give it a go can post a comment below or in chat and I'd be happy to walk them through the process in greater detail. \nRemember though, I've disassembled countless computers over the years, so if you haven't and still want to give this a go, please be patient and allow more time. Also, you will require some tools that you most likely won't have (but can easily purchase online).\n\nA: Sorry, no answer, but I have the same issue wth a client's iMac. Wont boot in safe mode or recovery mode, passes AHT, boots on another computer in target mode, HD checks out with Disk Utility on other computer. I suspect its a logic board problem that doesnt show up on the AHT.\n\nA: I have several 2010 era Macs with exact same failures. Fixing them costs more than we expect to get life out of them. We just boot them from external drives and use them in functions where they don't need to run at full speed. \nWe ensure backups are regular and expect to replace them with new hardware when they stop working with external drives. \nThe issues are likely cable degradation, noise or crosstalk issues internally on sata bus or aging powersupply with voltage deviations. Equally likely is that the main board is starting to fail or has some minor components out of spec. None of these are easy to diagnose or repair unless you are Apple and have access to highly skilled technicians and a ready supply of known good spare cables, parts, and access to Apple engineering. \n\nA: have you tried installing on an old 2.5\" lappy hdd inside the machine? i had an 2006 imac which wouldn't seem to power an internal 3.5\" drive properly (to the point of it failing to fully boot up (but did in a caddy)) but worked fine with a laptop 2.5\" drive. If you've got one lying about it's worth installing an os for testing purposes.\n", "Q: Filtering Live Photos Is it possible to setup a Smart Album in the Photos app that would group all Live Photos? Neither app seems to provide a quick way to find all your Live Photos.\n\nA: Starting with macOS Sierra 10.12.3, Apple has added a Live Photos Smart Album to Photos. It may be accessed from the Sidebar (View → Show Sidebar) or in Albums view (View → Albums).\nIt is still not possible to setup a custom Smart Album with Live Photo as a criterion.\n", "Q: Everytime I start my MacBook Air there is a blank interface window \nWhen I start my MacBook Air, an empty/blank window appears. Does anybody know how to get rid of or repair it so that when I boot up it doesn´t appear? There is nothing else wrong with it, I can just close the empty window and everything is fine. \n\nA: I have solved the problem by reinstalling latest OS. Follow these steps to do it :\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac first\n\n*Restart and keep cmd+R buttons pressed until Apple Logo shown\n\n*Choose from the menu reinstall OS (in my case : Reinstall Sierra)\n\n*Follow on screen instructions.\n\n\nReinstalling latest OS doesn't change or delete your current settings or installed softwares. \n\nA: You might consider using Activity Monitor to tell you which application is opening the window and take it from there. In Activity Monitor.app, select \"Windowed Processes\" from the drop-down Process filter menu in the app's toolbar. Being as you've just logged in, I doubt you will have many prospects to choose from and the task should be simple enough.\n\nA: Digging this out as it just happened to me on Mac M1 Monterey : use \"UI browser\" and activate the screen reader. Hover the mouse on the problematic window and you'll see to which app/process it belongs to... In my case, it was a Vtech app (app to update one of the toys of my kids ...).\n\nA: I had this same problem with my MPB M2Max (Ventura 13.2). Removing all login items made no difference. Logging into another, pristine account made no difference. Based on the reply from user3360735, I uninstalled the VTech app (Leaning Lodge) from my machine (used for my kid's watch), and the problem was solved. Note: I used the VTech uninstaller app to remove it.\n", "Q: How can I create a user account without password? I'm trying to create a second user account with limited permissions which I can use as a honeypot if someone steals my MacBook, but it refuses to allow a standard user without a password. Is there a way to work around this?\n\nA: Write the password clearly within the password hint field. You might have to surround it with some extra non-password text. \nFor example, the hint —\n\nForgot your 9-character password? It's not qwerty1234 of course\n\nwould be crackable (probably first time) by any kid who thinks about it for five seconds. Mac OS will allow multiple attempts.\n", "Q: Why does .2.2.2 in Spotlight equal 0.0016? If you use Spotlight in macOS with the . operator such as ‘.1.1.1.1’ the result is ‘0.0001’. What operations are being processed by Spotlight? .2.2.2 = 0.0016\n\n\nA: It's supposed to be multiplication, which in scientific notation is signified by placing the operands adjacent to one another (operators such as \"*\" or \"x\" are optional). I say supposed to be multiplication because .2 times .2 times .2 equals .008, not .0016 as presented in your question. I suspect you didn't gather the entire string for your title, and another .2 was present.\nYour screen shot, on the other hand, correctly gives 0.000064 as the result of .2 * .2 * .2 * .2 * .2 * .2. Since that operation is the same as asking for .2 to the sixth power, entering \".2^6\" into spotlight will return the same answer.\n\nA: If you start with .2 it shows that .2 = 0.2. This tells you that it's ready .2 as 0.2.\nIf you do .2.2 it shows .2.2 = 0.04. What operation performed on 0.2 and 0.2 would result in 0.04?\nHopefully you've now answered your own question. If not…\n\n 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\n", "Q: Apple and Windows font differences? I used the symbols font on a slide created using PowerPoint for Mac, and when I opened the same file in Windows the characters turned into squares. Does anyone know what is going on?\n\nA: The Macintosh Symbol font dates from.. well.. the Macintosh. I used Font Book to do a \"Get Info\" on the Symbols .ttf font file on my otherwise up-to-date iMac, and the most recent copyright date it bore was 1999. Whatever charming memories may appertain thereto, I remember Symbol mostly as the one-time proprietary Adobe --> Apple PostScript font which Microsoft Explorer would reproduce on its web pages, but which Outlook would not reproduce in formatted email and MS Word would choke on in .rtf files. Before .pdf files made it possible to embed fonts and exchange WYSIWYG documents in a trivial manner, and before Microsoft eventually licensed Symbol from Adobe, we used to suffer along with (I think) Wingdings / Webdings substitutions for situations where the Windows folks had to have the material show up on their screens.\nThing is, PowerPoint is a world into itself--and only a limited set of fonts are reliable among Windows OS variations, much less when Macs are included. A web search for \"safe powerpoint fonts\" will show you that Symbol isn't among them--nor, as tubedogg pointed out, is it any longer part of a standard Mac system install. \n\nA: Yes: The font you used is not installed on the target system, and whatever font it's using instead does not have glyphs for the characters specified.\n\nA: You should avoid using the old Symbol font (where you type Latin letters and get symbols instead) in documents these days, as it is not Unicode and there is no way to guarantee it will be seen properly at the other end.  Instead use the Character Viewer (Edit > Emoji & Symbols) to input your symbols from the Greek or Dingbats or various other symbol categories found there.\n", "Q: Picture in Picture for quicktime? I can't seem to find Picture-in-Picture (PiP) in QuickTime 10.4.\nIs macOS Sierra's new PiP feature only for Safari?\n\nA: QuickTime Player in macOS Catalina has a Picture in Picture button.\n\n\nA: QuickTime has had this feature for a while now, well before Sierra.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a video with QuickTime Player.\n\n*View > Float on Top.\n\n*Right-click or Control-click on the QuickTime Player icon in the Dock.\n\n*Options > Assign To: All Desktops. (This is available for any app.)\n\nA: A good solution is to simply drag a video file to the address bar in Safari and use its PIP feature.\n\nA: Here is what works for me using Quicktime 10.5:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start QuickTime\n\n*Right click the \"QuickTime\" icon in the dock, select \"New Movie Recording\"\n\n*Select the new movie window, drag it to where you want, resize\n\n*Select \"View/Float on top\" so now your movie window displaying the web cam is locked to the top view\n\n*Right click the \"QuickTime\" icon in the dock, select \"New Screen Recording\"\n\n*Double click the webcam movie window to clear the record bar (so it looks clean)\n\n*Start recording now, when done press \"cmd + ctrl + escape\" to stop recording.\n\n\nThis is working 100% :)\n", "Q: macOS Sierra lost focus Finder when using mission controls I never experienced something like this before I upgrade to macOS sierra a few days ago. At first, I didn't notice it, but after a while, it becomes annoying as hell.\n\n\nAfter selected a window from mission control, or just dismiss it (press esc), it just lost focus of Finder and switch to another random apps (Skype, Chrome, XCode, blah blah...)\nHow to fix this?\nUpdate:\nThis not only happened to Finder, but System Preference and sublimeText as well. Probably more apps might affected by this issue. But some apps (xcode, skype, chrome...) are not affected. I'm so confused....\nUpdate 2: I've found the reason, but it's not satisfied me!\nThe reason for this lost focus is because I've set the option of Finder in dock assign to all desktop:\n\nIt won't lose focus anymore if I set it to a specific desktop. However, I'd like to have all Finder in all desktop as I used to it before :( still annoying.\n\nA: I'm having exact the same issue, and it took me weeks to define it, while it was driving me crazy. Its clearly a bug, and the update 10.12.1 didn't work. But, there might be another solution. I've followed your advice and assigned finder and safari to different desktops, it works but its not the way it should be. However, assigning finder and safari to NONE works!!! I've tried to juggle with a few different apps and so far so good\n\nA: Another solution: safari None, finder All desktops and...deactivate \"Displays have separate spaces\" in mission control window.\n\n\nA: I assigned finder and safari to all desktops. Now it's reversed, safari stays on the back...\nBUT... my finder widows are always smaller than safari's, so it worked for me.\n", "Q: Why developers download Xcode.xip file? What's inside the xip file ?\nWhy don't download from app store? \n\nA: Inside the xip file was just Xcode.app. Developers(in fact anybody) can download the xip file from Apple Developer Website. Downloading from there is the same as downloading from the App Store. Probably is because if App Store is slow you can download from alternative(or some other reason). If you have a paid developer account, you can download a beta version of Xcode by downloading the xip file, which is not available from the App Store.\n", "Q: What is the equivalent of audacity for iPad? I'd like to edit sound files on my iPad with my daughter - copying and pasting clips, zooming in to see sound waves, and speeding up and slowing down sections of audio. \nMy question is: What is the equivalent of audacity for iPad?\n\nA: The currently-accepted answer, WavePad, seems to be sporadically unavailable on the App Store (at least in some regions). I haven’t found another suitable alternative. Also, some would not agree a proprietary product—especially one requiring payment to unlock all features—is actually an “equivalent” to open-source Audacity.\nHowever, there is new reason to hope for Audacity on iPad: it appears the technical obstacles cited by the Audacity team for the lack of iPad support are disappearing.\nAs of this writing (April 2021), the Audacity FAQ includes the following:¹\n\nCurrent versions of Audacity work internally with uncompressed audio to permit high quality editing with a wide range of effects. This requires more processing power and disk space than is available on most mobile devices. Also the wxWidgets interface library we use only has limited support for mobile operating systems and small screen resolutions.\nTherefore, considerable rewriting of Audacity and its interface will be required before Audacity will work on portable music players like iPod, smartphones like iPhone, tablet computers like iPad or any of the Nexus devices running Android.\nHowever, Audacity in principle does support a tablet PC running Windows (including Microsoft's \"Surface with Windows 8 Pro\" tablet)…\n\nAs of 2021, some new iPads and Macs now share the same Apple Silicon M1 processor; so, according to the FAQ answer above, there should no longer be a performance obstacle—iPad should now be more akin to the Windows tablet PC situation mentioned above. Storage, too, is no longer an issue: the highest-end M1 iPad configurations include terabytes of storage.\nIn fact, working with uncompressed data such as RAW images and video is one of the selling points Apple is emphasizing in its promotion of these new iPads, and companies such as Adobe have promised to deliver iPad versions of some of their pro creative apps.\n\n¹ Here’s a link to the archived version of the FAQ concurrent with this writing, and a link to current version.\n\nA: This turned out to be WavePad - which allowed editing and sound effects. \n", "Q: Corrupted macOS partition after GParted I followed a tutorial to create dual boot with macOS Sierra 10.12 and Kali-Linux 2.0.\nI created a bootable USB drive and booted on a Kali-Linux live session in order to use GParted and resize my macOS Partition.\nI selected the macOS partition and resized it from 239 GB to 200 GB. I got 2 partitions, with the 39 GB partition formatted to \"unallocated\".\nBut now when I try to boot to macOS, I get the Apple logo then a white cross and can't boot to macOS.\nI tried to boot in Recovery HD by holding cmdR, then I tried to use S.O.S. but it says I need an Assistant recovery disk. We can create a USB recovery disk by plugging in a USB drive to our MacBook then use the assistant to create a bootable USB drive which can repair disks, but like I said my MacBook can't boot on macOS, so I can't create it...\nIs there a way to download the iso of the recovery USB drive directly to create my own recovery USB drive from it?\nI read somewhere that I need to rewrite the corrects boot codes and my data isn't lost. Is that true?\nWhat do you think I can do?\nEdit:\nHere is the output of diskutil/gpt:\n\n(Sorry for the low compression rate I haven't 10 reputation to post more than 2 pics)\nI didn't expect the result of Diskutil. So much partition is normal ?\nEdit2:\nHere is the other screen I had after write commands :\n\nEdit 3\n\n\nA: GParted didn't really create unallocated disk space. Instead the MBR got bogus. The CoreStorage LVG and all subsequent containers got corrupted also, because the whole stack wasn't resized as required. Usually - in macOS - the whole stack is resized with the command diskutil cs resizeStack .... As far as I can say from remote, the ending boundary of the second partition was simply moved to lower block numbers which usually works with normal HFS+ volumes in GParted but not in this case with a CoreStorage stack. Fortunately some invisible data structures of the CS stack weren't overwritten.\nAdditionally the recovery partition wasn't moved properly. But this a different problem.\nInstead of the MBR you should have a pMBR.

But, when I open Terminal, I can't scroll through the bash history when pressing the up arrow.\n\nA: Have a look at /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal. The file contains comments that explain how to disable bash_sessions:\n# The save/restore mechanism is disabled if the following file exists:\n#\n# ~/.bash_sessions_disable\n\nor just disable their shell history mechanism\n# You may disable this behavior and share a single history by setting\n# SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 0. There are some common user customizations\n# that arrange to share new commands among running shells by\n# manipulating the history at each prompt, and they typically include\n# 'shopt -s histappend'; therefore, if the histappend shell option is\n# enabled, per-session history is disabled by default.

Therefore, I do not know why you can not boot from the internal drive Recovery partition. Some possible causes\n\n\n*\n\n*The GPT attributes are incorrectly set for the Recovery partition.\nThe correct value is 0x2000000000000. You can the command\ngdisk to view the attributes and correct any errors.\n\n*The Recovery partition filesystem has been corrupted.\n\n*The Recovery partition files have been corrupted.\n\n\nActually you do not have to boot to the Recovery partition to disable SIP. The web page Getting rEFInd form Sourceforge has a link where you can download \"A USB flash drive image file\". You can then use the dd command to copy the refind-flashdrive-0.10.4.img file to a USB flash drive. The exact commands that I entered are shown below. Caution: You may need to substitute disk1 with a different device.\ncd ~/Downloads/refind-flashdrive-0.10.4\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk1\nsudo dd if=refind-flashdrive-0.10.4.img of=/dev/disk1\n\nYou then can restart your Mac and hold down the option key to invoke the Startup Manage. Select the USB device icon labeled \"EFI Boot\" as shown below.\n\nNext, select the shield icon labeled \"Change SIP Policy\", as shown below.\n\nYou get the pop up message \"System Integrity Proection is disabled (0x77)\", as shown below.\n\nPrevious Answer Regarding Installing Windows\nYou do not need rEFInd to install any version of Windows on any Mac that can officially or unofficially support the version of Windows you are trying to install. \nIf you examine the Apple web site About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers, you can determine the mapping between the MacBook Pro models and identifiers. I listed a few below. This should clarify which entry in the table \"Boot Camp requirements by Mac model\" belongs to your model Mac.\nMacBook Pro (17-inch)              = MacBookPro1,2\nMacBook Pro (17-inch, Core 2 Duo)  = MacBookPro2,1\nMacBook Pro (17-inch, 2.4 GHz)     = MacBookPro3,1\nMacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2008)  = MacBookPro4,1\n\nBoot Camp Support Software 5.1.5722 is the wrong version for your model Mac. You should be using version 4.0.4033.\nIf your Mac can run Windows 10, the you will probably need a working optical (DVD) drive. If yours is missing or inoperative then you can still attempt to install but the procedure difficult. You can not use a USB flash drive Windows 10 installer.\nIf you can not boot to your OS X Recovery partition, then either you do not have a recovery partition of the partition tables are messed up.\nYour Mac is to old to use OS X Internet recovery. So using Option-Command-R is pointless.\nGenerally, the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" can be download to a USB flash drive though the use of the Boot Camp Assistant application. For the older model Macs, this software is often identical to the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" you would download using the Safari application for an old version of Windows. \nTherefore, most likely you can install Window 10 on you model Mac without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant application. So if this application is giving you problems, the you may be better of not using it.\n", "Q: How to tell why macOS thinks that a certificate is revoked? I cannot access Wikipedia on both my Macs. macOS says that the intermediate certificate used to sign Wikipedia’s certificate (GlobalSign Organization Validation CA - SHA256 - G2) has been revoked.\n\nI don’t believe that the certificate in question has been revoked, so I checked manually GlobalSign’s CRL and OCSP service and both tell me that the certificate is OK.\nAre there other sources of CRLs that macOS can potentially use? Is there a way to ask Security Framework to tell me what exactly is wrong with the certificate in its opinion?\n\nA: I tried crlrefresh rp and also manually deleting the OCSP cache with sudo rm /var/db/crls/*cache.db as documented by GlobalSign.\nHowever, the cache seems to be in a different location on macOS 10.12 Sierra. The following command worked for me and resolved the problem:\n$ sqlite3 ~/Library/Keychains/*/ocspcache.sqlite3 'DELETE FROM responses WHERE responderURI LIKE \"%http://%.globalsign.com/%\";'\n\nI also tried deleting the whole database, but it does not seem to come back automatically.\nIf unsure, better just restore ~/Library/Keychains/*/ocspcache.sqlite3* (including -shm and -wal) from a backup before the OCSP servers started to give wrong replies, for example from yesterday.\n\nA: Might be this, seems GlobalSign has got a problem with their OCSP. This is taken from their twitter (https://twitter.com/globalsign/status/786505261842247680?lang=da)\n\nWe are currently experiencing issues with our OCSP which is causing certificate warning messages. We aim to fix this as soon as possible.\n\nAnd also\n\nUPDATE: If you're a MAC user, please clear your cache with crlrefresh rp\n\nor View and/or Delete CRL, OCSP Cache\n\nA: Tried the instruction provided by Global Sign, but it didn't really helped me.\nsudo rm /var/db/crls/*cache.db Didn't actually helped because there's another cache file crlcache2.db which didn't match the *cache.db criteria.\nMy solution was to also remove this file, and then reboot.\nsudo rm /var/db/crls/crlcache2.db\nI think it's safe to sudo rm /var/db/crls/* because the folder only holds cache files. But if you chose to do it, do it at your own risk.\n\nA: The other option is to go to a site that you never use that uses globalsign, for example (for any english speakers) https://it.wikipedia.org (italian wikipedia) and when it comes up saying invalid cert explicitly trust the globalsign certificate until this CF is fixed properly\n\nA: The Question literally is \"Is there a way to ask Security Framework to tell me what exactly is wrong with the certificate in its opinion?\"  But this is literally what the Security Framework is doing.\nMacOS believes that certificate was revoked because an intermediate certificate in its chain of trust was (inadvertently) revoked.  See GlobalSign screw-up cancels top websites' HTTPS certificates.\nThe error message you are seeing is telling you exactly which intermediate certificate was revoked.  What more would you want to know?\n", "Q: Can closed (not running) apps access background app refresh? Can closed apps (i.e. not running, or suspended) access background app refresh or modify their program state to gain access to background app refresh? And conversely, if background app refresh is disabled, can apps only access data in the foreground?\nExample 1: Chat apps still get notifications if they are in the \"not running\" program state. How do they do this?\nExample 2: If I'm saving a note (with background app refresh off), and I return to the homescreen before the note is finished saving, will it continue to save?\nFrom the iOS docs, the app life cycle is pictured below. \n\niOS Developer Guide: The App Life Cycle\n\nA: Do not confuse Suspended with Not Running. Suspended means the app is still in memory but otherwise not utilizing any resources. Not Running means the app is not in memory at all due to being involuntarily terminated, either because the system required resources for a foreground app, or because the user force-quit the app.\nBackground App Refresh (BAR) =/= \"Background\" as shown in that diagram:\n\n\n*\n\n*BAR allows apps to update content on a very limited basis, on a schedule set and enforced by iOS, generally about once per day.\n\n*The Background state shown in that diagram is Background Execution, which allows apps to complete certain tasks in the background. BAR being disabled has no effect on apps being able to use Background Execution.\nBackground Execution is generally only allowed if an app has not been force-quit by the user (the exception being \"location apps\"). Apps in any state, including Terminated, can use Background Execution if they meet the requirements below. If necessary, they will be relaunched by the system into the background (again, subject to the force-quit limitations above). See my answer on a similar question:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Apps that play audible content to the user while in the background, such as a music player app\n  \n*Apps that record audio content while in the background\n  \n*Apps that keep users informed of their location at all times, such as a navigation app\n  \n*Apps that support Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\n  \n*Apps that need to download and process new content regularly\n  \n*Apps that receive regular updates from external accessories\n  \n  \n  There is one other case, which is downloading in the background. This is a special case, though, because the app itself is still suspended and the download process is handed off to the system, in case the app has to be terminated by the system to reclaim resources.\n\nWhat's not in the linked answer is notifications. Non-local notifications are generated on a server somewhere and pushed to the device via Apple Push Notifications (APN). The act of receiving a notification does not indicate the app itself did anything.\nIn your note example, when the note app transitions to the background, it is given a brief amount of time to save state. If it's in the process of doing something like saving a note, and it cannot complete it in the time allowed, it can ask for an extension, essentially, and then notify the system when it's done so the app can be suspended. This type of background work can be used by any app, not just those that fall under the categories listed above.\n", "Q: Changing New Mail Sound in macOS Sierra As of macOS Sierra, assigning a custom sound file in Mail no longer appears possible. All I get is “New Messages Sound” in addition to the old options:\n\nIs there a way to assign a custom Mail sound in macOS Sierra, possibly via editing a plist?\nThe interesting thing is, I’ve logged into the Guest account, and even though the same option is selected, the sound that plays when a new mail comes in is the sound I had previously under MY user account. But I can’t seem to find where that sound file is assigned.\n\nA: Add your custom mail sounds to ~/Library/Sounds.

Currently, when I try to delete files I receive the message \"The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified.\"\nEdit: I tried using tmutil associatedisk, but I don't see any old versions when I \"Enter Time Machine\".\n\nA: There is a command named bypass that should allow you do remove Time Machine related files. This command should precede the rm command.\nThe path to the bypass command is given below.\n/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass\n\nAn example is given below.\n/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass rm -f /path/to/file/name\n\nThere also a service written by a third party that allows you do execute the bypass/rm commands from the Finder application.

I am looking at installing a SSD in the original HD bay for my OS and Programs and moving the 1TB drive to the optical bay. My current HDD location says it has a link speed of 6gb and negotiated link speed of 3gb and the optical drive says it has a link speed of 6 gb with a negotiated speed of 1.5gb. So my question is twofold. 1. Will my current drive work correctly in the optical drive space and 2. Can I put a 1TB in there? Most of the adapters specify up to 500gb. \nThanks\n\nA: Yes.  You can put a 1TB drive in there.\nThe port that your optical drive connects to is a standard SATA III port.  This is why you are seeing that it supports 6Gb/s.  The \"negotiated\" speed is the speed at which the device will communicate.  A SATA I drive has a transfer rate of 1.5Gb/s.  So, even though SATA III can go 6Gb/s, a SATA I can't go any faster.\nA SATA III port is backward compatible with SATA II and SATA I.  That being said, a SATA port is a SATA port - it doesn't care if you are attaching a spinning hard disk, an optical disk or an SSD.  SATA supports 48-bit LBA (Logical Block Addressing) which means your drive can be up to 128 PB (Peta Bytes) or 128,000 1TB drives.  So, there is no limitation from a hardware standpoint.\nI have personally [used this model optical bay drive caddy][3] with a 1TB drive with no problems.  The specs say \"up to 500GB\" but I suspect that since this product has been out for such a long time, they just never bothered to update the marketing material.\n\nA: Try MacSales.com and use My Upgrades.

How can I find out what brought it up, and is there a better way to ensure it stays down? \n\nA: Use the networksetup command instead. On my system en0 is Wi-Fi, so I use networksetup -setairportpower en0 off. I actually use a little AppleScript that sits in my Dock and toggles the state. See the networksetup manual page for additional information using networksetup.\nSave the AppleScript code as an application named Toggle Wi-Fi and then you can run it as needed/wanted.

You can ascertain it in System Preferences > Network.\n\nA: @user3439894 has answered the part of the question about how to disable Ethernet and have it stay down; I'd like to address the question of why ifconfig en0 down doesn't do it.\nThe basic reason is that macOS has two different levels of network configuration: the live state (which ifconfig en0 down changes) and the \"configuration database\" which corresponds to the settings created in the Network pane of System Preferences and/or the networksetup command. And there's a \"configuration daemon\" (configd) whose job it is to adjust the live network state to match what the database says it should be.\nThe reason it works this way is that the config database describes the network settings in a more flexible and coherent way than the live state does. For example, the config database can have multiple groups of settings (\"locations\") and easily switch between them, adjusting everything -- interface state, IP settings, routing, DNS, etc -- in a single operation.\nAnyway, when you use ifconfig en0 down, you've created an inconsistency between the live state and what the config database says the state should be. configd won't notice this immediately, because it isn't the sort of event configd looks for (ethernet being plugged in or unplugged, WiFi network being joined or dropped, etc). But sometime later, something will wake configd up and it may (or may not) reset the interface state back to what the config database says it should be.\nSo, the solution is to use Network Preferences or networksetup. These both make changes to the config database, then wake up configd so it'll apply the changes to the live state.\n", "Q: chown to remote folder: Operation not permitted I'm making a script sync a local folder with a remote one from a NAS, the folder has been mounted into OS X with the NAS administrator name and password.\nThe script is:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/rsync -rav --delete --exclude=\".*\" /path-to-origin/ /Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/\n\nThe script must be executed by a user called Auser so I call the script from the command line this way:\nsudo -u Auser script-to-rsync.sh\n\nAnd the reply I get in Terminal is:\nbuilding file list ... done\n./\nrsync: chgrp \"/Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/.\" failed: Operation not permitted (1)\nrsync: chgrp \"/Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/file.ext\" failed: Operation not permitted (1)\nrsync: chgrp \"/Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/.\" failed: Operation not permitted (1)\n\nsent 311 bytes  received 62 bytes  746.00 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 53864490174  speedup is 144408820.84\nrsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/rsync/rsync-47/rsync/main.c(992) [sender=2.6.9]\n\nI'm sure it's a permissions issue, so I've tried to change the owner of the destination folder to Auser without success:\nsudo chown fmserver /Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/\n\nAnd I get:\nchown: /Volumes/ombacap/om15/copies/: Operation not permitted\n\n\nA: Many foreign file systems (such as the Windows-native ones like FAT16/FAT32 etc) do not have a concept of file ownership on the filesystem level, and so the system call to change the owner is blocked with an error message.\n", "Q: Move an Item from a Parent Folder to its Subfolder I was wondering if anyone could help me with a script that will move a file/files from a parent folder into its subfolder.

I'm using family sharing to get the Apple Music family discount, but the only problem is that it stops me buying apps with my own account, and instead requires the family sharing organiser to buy them. This is the same even with free apps, which seems a bit weird.\nIs there any way to keep family sharing, but use my own account for buying apps?\n\nA: Ask to Buy funnels all requests for app or media content purchases to the Family Organizer, and anyone else they have designated as a Parent/Guardian, to approve the purchase. For a paid app or media content, once approved it is bought with the credit card designed by the Family Organizer.\nWhen setting up Family Sharing, all Apple IDs which have an age of 13 or less automatically have Ask to Buy enabled for them. When inviting those aged 13 to 17, iOS prompts you to enable Ask to Buy.\nOnce enabled, the Family Organizer can later disable it for each individual. If their account reflects that they are over 18 when it is disabled, it cannot be reenabled for that account. Similarly, Ask to Buy is not even an option for users who are invited after they turn 18.\nIn your case, your ID is set up for Ask to Buy.

Main process spawns the Google Chrome Helper processes for every tab. If you check the .app bundle, you'll see it resides in /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/XX.X.XXXX.XX/Google\\ Chrome\\ Helper.app. You can't launch it directly, because main app has to be running. \nI couldn't find the other way around than just creating osascript like this:\nopen -j /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app && sleep 1 && osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set visible of application process \"Google Chrome\" to false'\n\nHowever this will create 1 sec. delay in your script.\n", "Q: After upgrade to macOS Sierra secd is using 98% power and cannot be force quit in Activity Monitor Fan has ran for 3 days after upgrading my MacBook Air (mid 2011). \n\nA: To fix this go to the iCloud settings panel and start the process to enable iCloud Keychain, enter a password, but cancel before completing.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra: Wrong 'Date Modified' column when searching in finder I did ample research before posting this.\nI am using macOS Sierra 10.12 on a brand-new iMac, and when I search my files (I am searching for all .psd files in a folder with many sub-folders) the Date Modified column in the search result doesn't match the files' info.\nFor example, the first .psd that pops up from the search is dated yesterday 2AM in the 'Date Modified' column (in list view), but opening the file info reveals the correct date, which is today, as I have just created the file.\nI tried a number of solutions I found online:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting\n\n*Relaunching Finder\n\n*Resetting the system preferences for date and time\n\n*Deleting com.apple.finder.plist and the sidebar.plist and relaunching Finder\n\n\nAt this point I don't know what to try anymore.\nEdit: I forgot to say that if I view the files in Finder in list mode, without searching for them, the dates are correct! It's only when I search.\nEdit 2: Here is a screenshot of the problem, search window on the left, regular window on the right.\n\nI can't determine whether it happens only with .psd files, but here's some more data which might be useful: The files are shot on a camera, then downloaded on a Windows computer, then transferred to my iMac on an SD card. The dates on both date created and date modified fields don't match with the dates they were shot, downloaded, nor transferred.\nIf I create a new PSD or JPG or TXT file on my Mac, it displays correctly both in search and regular browsing.\nI really need to be able to sort these files by date modified!\n\nA: I am also experiencing the same issue and here are my findings. \nI am assuming the difference between file and EXIF dates are clear, otherwise ask google before reading my post.\nI edited the dates of 3 raw image files (A, B, and C.CR2) as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*File creation date: Jan 1, 2016 - 3:00PM;\n\n*File modification date: Jan 1, 2016 - 4:00PM;\n\n*EXIF Date time original: Jan 1, 2016 - 5:00PM.\n\n\nAfter editing the dates (see attached picture !):\n\n\n*\n\n*The top right Finder window containing the 3 files shows the edited file creation and modification dates under the \"Date created\" and \"Date modified\" columns;\n\n*The top left Finder window displaying the search results (I wrote \"cr2\" in the search field) shows the \"Date time original\" EXIF timestamp (shooting date) under the \"Date created\" column and the \"Date time digitized\" EXIF timestamp under the \"Date modified\" column (cf. metadata in the Lightroom window). Note the \"Date time digitized\" EXIF timestamp under the \"Date modified\" column is the \"File modification\" date prior editing the dates.\n\n\n\nThe dates were edited with \"A better Finder Attributes\" app. Note that the result is the same if the dates are edited through terminal with the \"touch\" command.\nHence, I conclude the problem described in the OP is due to the fact the Spotlight search result displays the file EXIF dates, while a normal Finder window display the file creation and modification dates. I assume this is not a problem but an intentional behavior; however, this is clearly very misleading.\nI hope my post fully explains the inconsitency reported in the OP.\n(MacOS Sierra 10.12.1, A better Finder Attributes 5.37, Lightroom 6.6.1)\n", "Q: Can I re-install MacPorts but leave my Python installation, done via MacPorts, alone? Okay, I admit it, I didn't really think it through when I clicked on the button to upgrade to Sierra. Having done that, I've of course made MacPorts lose its mind. I mostly don't notice because once I install Python and PIP, I don't do much with MacPorts -- except to install things like LaTeX or wget. \nCan I re-install MacPorts without messing up my Python installation? I have a lot of packages installed -- numpy, scipy, nltk, sklearn, etc. -- that I would just as soon leave alone. Everything is working well.\n\nA: The answer is unknown.\nMacports is only supported and tested if you do a complete reinstall of it when you chnage the versions of macOS used.\nYou might be get away with rebuilding only a few of the ports but if you have a problem the only support is delete and reinstall as no one has the time to see what happens when you chnage the OS.\n\nA: Export your list of installed packages with Macports.  Uninstall your existing copy of Macports (Google search will turn up the two step process).  Then upgrade to the new OS.  Simply install the new Macports for your new macOS and finally install the packages from the \"list\" you kept.\nSave your list of installed ports:\n\nport -qv installed > myports.txt\n\nRestore your ports following a few steps found here:\nhttps://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration\nDo NOT upgrade your macOS before exporting or first removing your Macports.

What are all 12 workouts?\nAlso, Apple says you can select up to 5 metrics.\nWhat are all the different metrics?\n\nA: The 12 workout types are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cycling (Indoor & Outdoor)\n\n*Run (Indoor & Outdoor)\n\n*Walk (Indoor & Outdoor)\n\n*Swim (Pool & Open Water)\n\n*Elliptical\n\n*Rower\n\n*Stair-Stepper\n\n*Other (these can be labeled as various activities like Strength Training, but the label is purely cosmetic—it has no incidence on calorie computations)\n\n\nThe various metrics are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Current Pace & Speed\n\n*Average Pace & Speed\n\n*Distance\n\n*Laps\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Total Calories\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n\nThey are not all available for every workout type. For instance, Pace is available for Run/Walk, while Cycling may show your Speed.\nSwims cannot display Current Pace, only Average Pace.\nLaps are only available during Pool Swims, whereas stationary machine workouts (such as Elliptical and Indoor Cycling) cannot display Distance-related metrics (eg. Speed).\nPace and Distance calculations for Indoor Walks/Runs are dependent on how well you’ve calibrated your WATCH, and require that you swing your arms throughout the workout. Holding onto the handlebars will cause WATCH to think you are not exercising.\nDuration, Active/Total Calories and Heart Rate are available for all workout types.\nCalorie computations are calibrated over time, as you wear and use your WATCH. They factor in both your heart rate and the weight you’ve recorded in the Health app.\n\nA: As of watchOS version 3.1, there are twelve workout types.\nEach workout type has a default sequence of metrics that the watch displays when using the \"multiple metric\" workout view. One can edit this sequence, adding or removing metrics and rearranging their order. Note, though, that once you edit the metrics sequence for a workout type, there's no easy way to revert to the default sequence. In the interest of allowing safer customization, let's document the default sequences here, by workout type. \n\nOutdoor Walk\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n*Distance\n\n\nOutdoor Run\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Current Pace\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n*Distance\n\n\nOutdoor Cycle\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Current Speed\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n*Distance\n\n\nIndoor Walk\n\n\n*\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Total Calories\n\n*Hear Rate\n\n*Distance\n\n\nIndoor Run\n\n\n*\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Total Calories\n\n*Hear Rate\n\n*Distance\n\n\nIndoor Cycle\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Total Calories\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n\nElliptical\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Total Calories\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n\nRower\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Total Calories\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n\nStair Stepper\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Total Calories\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n\nPool Swim\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Laps\n\n*Distance\n\n\nOpen Water Swim\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Average Pace\n\n*Distance\n\n\nOther\n\n\n*\n\n*Duration\n\n*Active Calories\n\n*Total Calories\n\n*Heart Rate\n\n", "Q: How do I make the user's 'library' folder within a Time Machine backup available to 3rd party apps? As many users know, the Library folder located within a User's Home directory is hidden in recent versions of macOS. And, to make this visible, the user can hold down the Option key while accessing the Go menu from within the Finder.\nIn terms of Time Machine backups, the same Library folder is also hidden from view. Users can make these visible within the Finder by making 'hidden' files visible and navigating around their Time Machine backups.\nHowever, what I am looking for is a way to make this same folder (i.e. the user's home 'library') on Time Machine backups visible to 3rd party applications. \nBy way of example, let's say I wanted to use data recovery software to import an old iOS iTunes backup located within a Time Machine backup, how would I do this? \nMaking the folder visible within the Finder does not help, although I could then manually copy it from the TM backup drive onto another disk and import it from there, but I'm looking for a more convenient/elegant solution if one exists?\n\nA: As the latest backup is always going to be in the same place, then it's going to be the same path as ~/Library, plus the TM path.\nRegular path is ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync\nor longhand Volumes/[boot drive]/Users/[user name]/Library/Application Support/MobileSync\nso in Time Machine it will be\nVolumes/[TM drive]/Backups.backupdb/[mac name]/Latest/[boot drive]/Users/[user name]/Library/Application Support/MobileSync\nYour larger problem may be that the folders in there have special permissions rwx------ & you cannot get any further than Library using Go to Folder... from the Go menu.\n", "Q: \"Connection insecure\" error when trying to manage a Gmail or Yahoo account About a week ago, I was prompted to reset my Yahoo e-mail password.

That sounds like it may differ from your experience, so go ahead and check with Photos v3.0\nIf when you do export your photos again they still retain the correct EXIF timestamp but show the wrong Created timestamp on the file, then try using \"Better Finder Attributes\" app to first copy EXIF date to creation date, then to copy the creation date to the modification date.\n(I have no affiliation with the \"Better Finder Attributes\" app, I'm simply a user of it).\n", "Q: FAT (file allocation table) variant used when disk is formatted using OS X (macOS) disk utility Disk Utility on OS X (macOS) shows \"MS-DOS (FAT) \" as one of the format options\n\nFAT (File Allocation Table) has many variants like FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32\nMy questions are mentioned below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which FAT variant is taken when I formate disk using \"MS-DOS (FAT) format?\n\n*What is maximum size (for partition/disk) of FAT variant selected in question 1?\n\n\nA: In Disk Utility, when choosing MS-DOS (FAT), the FAT version will be size appropriate. In other words, if creating a disk image of 1.4 MB it will be formatted FAT12, if 100 MB it will be FAT16 and in the case of your 8 GB Flash Drive it will be FAT32. The FAT (File Allocation Table) link in your question answers #2 however there is nothing to worry about as it's considerable larger then your Flash Drive.\nThe issue to be aware of is on a FAT32 volume the maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB minus 1 byte or 4,294,967,295 (232 − 1) bytes.\n\nA: Apple MSDOS-FAT is FAT32; max partition size = 2T; max file size is 4GB\nFAT12 and FAT16 are (as far as I remember) pre-Win95.\n", "Q: How to add an existing smart folder to the sidebar I previously used the option to add a smart folder to the sidebar on its creation.

Until now I disabled WLAN, because my Mac is connected via Ethernet (cable). However, Siri needs WLAN to determine where I am. Thus without WLAN, Siri cannot answer my questions e.g. about the weather. So I enabled it again.\nNow my Mac is also connected via WLAN. Does this mean, net traffic now goes over the air though the Mac is connected via Ethernet? (I wouldn’t like that.)\n\nA: No, not necessarily. The priority given by your Mac to the various connections are determined by the order of services listed in your Network settings. To view this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Network:\n\n\n\nIf your Ethernet connection is not listed above your Wi-Fi connection, you can change the order as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Cog/Gear icon (on the right of the minus '-' sign at bottom left)\n\n*Select Set Service Order...\n\n*In the Service Order window that appears, click and drag the Ethernet connection so it is at the top (or at least above your Wi-Fi connection)\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\nAs an aside, Siri just needs to be able to access the Internet to work, it doesn't specifically require a WLAN connection to work. If you can't get it to work on Ethernet, then perhaps you should post another question about that.\n", "Q: OS X internet recovery older version problem I am using Macbook Pro Mid 2012 13\" with 128GB SSD.  The latest installed version of OS X was El Capitan which crashed during a Sierra upgrade.\nInternet recovery mode worked somehow to land me to install download and install a new OS but it's Mountain Lion, which came installed when I bought the Macbook few years back However, it's rejecting to install on current SSD drive as shown in pic. \nI have another 320GB HDD, so is this the only way to reinstall?  First I do a fresh install of Lion on the external HDD?  What I should I do? \nWhat is a  step by step procedure as all I want to do is run OSX on SSD drive but keeping all my older data. I can not afford to wipe it.\nHowever,  I did back up some of its backup onto my PC. If I install Lion the HDD can I then download Sierra and create an install disk to update/fix/install corrupted OS X on SSD?\n\n\nA: Note: This answer has been updated because the comment below misunderstands how Recovery works. When your Recovery partition gets updated, not only will it run the newest version of macOS, but the installer gets updated to the newest version as well.\nIf a Mac shipped with macOS 12.3 or earlier, then Internet Recovery will install whatever version of macOS shipped on the Mac, even if the Mac had previously been updated.\nIf the Mac shipped with macOS 12.4 or later, or was upgraded to 12.4 or later, then Internet Recovery will install the most recent version of macOS that is supported on that Mac.\nSo if your Mac shipped with 10.11, and you updated to 10.12, then:\nInternet Recovery will install 10.11\nRecovery will install 10.12\nIf your Mac shipped with 10.11 and you updated to 10.12.4, then:\nInternet Recovery will install 10.13 (or later)\nRecovery will install 10.12.4\n\nA: This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read. option-cmd-R, Disk Utility → Erase, install\n", "Q: Bi Directional folders (Mac to Mac) Currently we are running a system where a group of 12ish Apple Mac computers connect to a Mac Mini Server. \nWe also have a few off-site teams who need to access said server as well. We would like to know if there's a modern system that allows the user to drop files into a folder which then shares with the server and also shares with the off-site teams. (obviously allowing time for upload/download time)\nThis would need to be peer-to-peer we do not want to use Cloud Computing.\nAn example of this being used would be:\nFolder on User 1's desktop is populated with files, the same folder appears on the server which also appears on user 2's desktop.

When will my Mac (15inch MacBook Pro Mid 2012 ) become a vintage product?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201624\n\nA: Generally speaking, based in part on information in the linked support article in your question the vintage designation is a 5 to 7 year window, so the two Mid 2012 15\" MacBook Pro models vintage windows are shown below:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) was discontinued in October 2013. So October 2018 would be the start of the 5 year window, with October 2020 being the 7 year window.\n\n*The MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) was discontinued in Feburary 2013. So Feburary 2018 would be the start of the 5 year window, with Feburary 2020 being the 7 year window.\nThat said, if you live in Turkey, California or France, make note of what it said in the article, quoted below.\nFrom Vintage and obsolete products:\n\nVintage products are those that have not been manufactured for more than 5 and less than 7 years ago. Apple has discontinued hardware\n  service for vintage products with the following exceptions:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Mac products purchased in the country of Turkey. Owners of vintage Mac products may obtain service and parts from Apple service\n  providers within the country of Turkey.\n  \n*Products purchased in the state of California, United States, as required by statute\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Owners of vintage Mac products may obtain service and parts from Apple service providers within the state of California, United\n  States. \n  \n*Owners of vintage iPod products in the state of California may obtain service from Apple Retail Stores or by contacting AppleCare at\n  1-800-APL-CARE.\n  \n*Owners of vintage iPhone products in the state of California may obtain service from Apple Retail Stores or by contacting AppleCare at\n  1-800-APL-CARE. For products purchased in France, see Statutory\n  Warranties of Seller and Spare Parts.\n  \n  \n\n\nA: The window for vintage Mac is at the shortest - 5 years from the date when Apple stops selling that model at retail in the country.\nSometimes there is more time, sometimes it's 5 years to the day. If you can establish the end date for your model in your country, you should have a good estimate by adding 5 to the year.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra Bluetooth is skipping As soon as I upgraded to macOS Sierra a few days ago, my Bluetooth playback has been so choppy/buggy that it is entirely unusable. Playback will be as normal for 2-10 seconds, then cut completely for a few seconds, then cut back in, and so on.\nI am connected to a Sony Bluetooth speaker, to which I can confirm that other OS X (El Capitan) and Android/iPhone devices can stream audio to without incident.\nI do not have any other Bluetooth speakers to test on, but I strongly feel it's the fault of the macOS Sierra machine, not the speaker.\nI am not using any 3rd party or custom audio routing internally, it's literally just routing audio output to the Bluetooth speaker as normal.

If this is a genuine bug in macOS Sierra, it seems like a massive oversight.\n\nA: As stated on a different answer, and I am not quite sure why it was downvoted, the first thing to look for is \"bluetooth and 2.4 GHz interference\". Make a simple test to switch to a 5GHz Wifi network, and try your Sony Bluetooth speaker once again.\n\nA: No. Bluetooth audio is quite solid for me on Sierra (and High Sierra now). \nThe first things I would look at are:\n\n\n*\n\n*massive CPU usage in case the background audio processes are not able to get enough CPU.\n\n*make sure the audio playing is local and not streamed\n\n*check for faulty / failing hardware\n\n*bluetooth and 2.4 GHz interference\n\n\nI'm using my AirPods to test bluetooth - they are rock solid even when other bluetooth accessories seem to chop/lag/skip/drop.\n", "Q: iCloud gets stuck syncing in Sierra, how do I fix I recently upgraded from Yosemite to Sierra.  I have ~ 2.5Gb of data on my iCloud Drive.  I am NOT using the Documents and folders sync, photos sync, or any of the other special folder sync options available.  The exception is that I am syncing preferences.  As I have said I do have two folders that sit in the iCloud Drive that are not part of any of the special folders.  \nThe problem is that after the initial sync, any change in those files/folders siting on the iCloud Drive get stuck syncing.  The icon animation (pie chart) and the text that appears under the file/folder indicating the progress cycles between 0 and ~90%.  It never gets to 100%.  \nOn previous occasions restarting fixed the problem, but only temporarily.  Currently, I have a 53Mb file that has been syncing for 4 days now.  I have tried restarting to no avail.  While signing out of iCloud, brings up the message, \"iCloud need to finish updating before continuing with signing out\".  But it never finishes.\nAdditionally, I have tried to upload the file manually to iCloud via Safari, this process is also stuck currently.\nAnybody have any ideas of what might be going on?\n\nA: Well it seems that Kaspersky Internet Security (16.0.0.245b.a.c) is the problem here.  I found that changing the \"Check secure connections (HTTPS)\" setting allowed syncing as usual.  This setting is found under the Protection tab in Preferences, under Web Anti-Virus.  I changed the option from \"Check secure connections (HTTPS)>always\", to \"Check secure connections (HTTPS)>Only for Parental Control, Safe Money, and Privacy Protection\".\nI also added icloud.com to the Trusted zone and Web site tracking exclusions, but I do not believe these changes were necessary or had any effect.\"\n", "Q: Lost email settings and no icon for Mail I've lost my Settings → Mail, Contacts, and Calendars on my iPhone 5.  No icon for Mail and no Mail settings.  How do I get it back?\n\nA: On iOS 10 you can delete stock apps. If you accidentally deleted your Mail app, to get it back, you have to search it on the App Store and reinstall.  \nThey are not actually deleted though, just hidden, so you won't be downloading anything.\n\nA: Go to App Store and search for Mail (Not Mail for IPhone).  Download the app.  If you have previously set this up, it should load everything as if nothing happened.  \n", "Q: How to control fan speed in macOS Sierra? After replacing the hard drive in my 2009 iMac 27\", I noticed that the hard drive fan spins at maximum speed since the sensor cable is not plugged in. (The new SSD drive doesn't support it)\nTo solve this issue, I installed a software called \"Macs Fan Control\" that can read out the temperature from the SMART status of the drive and control the fan speed itself. \nThis was a near-perfect solution until I upgrade my system to macOS Sierra. Now both \"Macs Fan Control\" and also \"smcFanControl\" can't control the fans anymore and the latter reports that I am running it on an unsupported system.\nNow my question is, can I somehow control the fan speed manually using Terminal etc. or do I have to \"trick\" the sensor hardware-wise?\n\nA: I am a firm believer in avoiding software \"hacks\" to fix hardware issues.  To fix this problem, you need the sensor.  Unfortunately, as you have found out, your SSD doesn't support this connection.\nHowever, OWC makes an digital inline temperature sensor.  Basically, it goes between the SATA power cable and the SATA power connector of your HDD/SSD.  The temp sensor goes on your drive.\nThe best part about this is that it's a \"once-and-done\" solution meaning future OS upgrades won't be susceptible to software incompatibility problems like you are experiencing now.\n\nC|Net did an article on this exact problem and a review of this solution.\n\nA: Try SSD Fan Control and you might need an SMC reset.\nIt works just like Macs Fan Control but it supports Sierra.  I have this installed on my Late 2009 iMac with a Samsung SSD and it works.\nHope it works!\n\nA: The internal thermal sensor of the (former) HDD can be replaced by a discrete thermal sensor which is to be fastened on your new drive (by adhesive tape or so).  You can use an optical disc drive thermal sensor cable for that, it has the same sensor.  The Apple part number is 593-0493, it should be available below 10€ (or 10 US$).\nBecause the sensor is just a standard transistor called 2N3904 you could even solder that cable yourself.  Typically the former internal sensor connection cable consists of a gray and a black wire.  The gray wire goes to both the base and collector terminals of the transistor and the black wire goes to the emitter terminal.  Please be sure to insulate those connections properly and fix the transistor to the new „drive“.\n\nA: You need to short the sensor plug cables. This is how people normally do it. Just pull the plug off the end and then strip the wires, twist them together, and use electrical tape or similar to protect them from the rest of the computer. \n", "Q: How can I clean up old notes left in my Gmail account by notes.app? I keep my Notes.app notes synced with my Gmail account.\nIn Gmail, I can see all my current notes in the Notes label and associated sublabels.\nI can also see many older versions of current notes, and previously-deleted notes, not attached to any label.\nIs there any search I can do in Gmail which will reliably find all messages that were created by Notes.app, so that I can delete old versions / \"deleted\" notes permanently?  (I can find individual notes by searching for their subject line, but I no longer remember all the subject lines of all the notes I've deleted, and I can't find any search string that will reliably find Notes.app notes which no longer have the Notes label.)\nRelatedly: is there any way I can configure Notes.app so that when it removes a note (or older version of a note) from the Notes label (or a sublabel) it moves it into the trash, rather than leaving it cluttering up my messages archive?\n\nA: It appears that the following search will find all messages created by Notes.app, and, for me at least, no messages not created by it:\nfrom:username@gmail.com -in:drafts -in:sent -in:chats -l:SMS\n\n(Where username is my Gmail username.  The SMS label is used by the SMS Backup+ android app, which stores SMS messages in Gmail in a similar way to Notes.app, albeit under a different label.)\nTo find messages which are no longer \"live\" in Notes.app (i.e., are older versions or deleted notes), and also exclude any other labels like SMS, use \"-has:userlabels\", like this:\nfrom:username@gmail.com -in:drafts -in:sent -in:chats -has:userlabels \n\nN.B.: For me the results are 100% old or deleted Notes.app notes, but this search will find any other messages created in the same way (i.e., via the IMAP interface, with your address in the from field) so have a look through the search results carefully before doing any mass deletions, just to be on the safe side!\n", "Q: Files have disappeared overnight - where are they? Yesterday I filmed an interview and copy/pasted the files from my SD card onto my iMac, then imported the files into Premiere Pro to view the footage. Everything looked good, so I ejected the card and formatted it for another shoot. The files and Premiere Pro project were fine. I imported my next project, no problem.\nHowever today when I opened the first project to begin my edit, I found that all of my files and the folder they were saved in had disappeared:\n/users/adam/documents/DSS/Amanda/Amanda Video/Rushes\nThe \"Rushes\" folder and its content no longer exits, and was instead left with an empty \"untitled folder\".\nI've searched finder, trash, everywhere for the \"Rushes\" folder and \"MVI_0538.MOV\" onward (up to 0570).\nIf it weren't for the Premiere Pro file path it seems that there would be no evidence of the files ever existing - is there any way of recovering them or finding any trace of them? Perhaps by using the terminal?\nThanks,\nAdam\n\nA: Assuming the files are actually gone there are two potential solutions I can think of, neither of which necessarily rely on Terminal (which will allow you to see invisible files, but not deleted files).  The first of which requires that you are using Time Machine.  If Time Machine was connected to your backup drive yesterday after you imported your files, it would create a new backup every hour including any files that were new to the system since the previous backup.  Simply open Time Machine, navigate to the folder where your files were previously, and go back to a time when they were still there.  Highlight the file(s) and click the Recover button.\nThe second solution requires third party software.  When files are \"deleted\" they are usually only removed from the \"catalog\" or \"index\" of the file system.  This means according to the index the space where file X used to take up is now empty and available to be overwritten at any point in the future when it needs to save new files.  Data recovery software simply ignores this index and scans the actual blocks of space on the drive to see if there is any data there. I don't endorse any data recovery software in particular however, as its been years since I've used any.  Searching the web will find various titles, both commercial and open source, and you'll likely need an external HDD to recover found files onto.  Best of luck.\n\nA: It sounds like you may have accidentally deleted or moved the \"Rushes\" folder and its contents on your iMac, which contained the video files you need for your project. If you've searched your computer and can't find any trace of the files, there are a few options you can try:\n\n*\n\n*Check your trash: If you haven't already, check your trash bin on your iMac to see if the \"Rushes\" folder or any of the video files are there. If they are, you can restore them to their original location.\n\n*Use a data recovery software: There are a number of data recovery software programs available that can help you recover deleted or lost files. These programs work by scanning your computer's hard drive and searching for any files that may have been deleted or lost. Some popular options include Disk Drill, EaseUS Data Recovery, and Recuva. Note that data recovery software may not be able to recover all lost files, and the success of the recovery will depend on a variety of factors, such as how long ago the files were deleted, and whether they have been overwritten by other data.\n\n*Contact a data recovery service: If you're not comfortable using data recovery software or if you're unable to recover the files on your own, you may want to consider contacting a data recovery service. These services specialize in recovering lost data and may be able to help you recover the video files you need. However, note that these services can be expensive and there's no guarantee that they'll be able to recover your files.\n\nIn the future, it's always a good idea to back up your files to an external hard drive or cloud storage service to avoid losing important data.\n", "Q: Ignore call without declining it Is there a way to not only mute a call, but stop it hijacking the entire screen? I don't want the person to know I'm not answering their calls, so don't want to decline it and have it get sent to voicemail early.\n\nA: The best I've come up with is to hit the Volume Down button on the side of the phone during a situation like this. That causes the phone to stop ringing/vibrating, but doesn't decline the call right then and there (maybe this is what you referred to as \"mute a call\"?). The incoming call will last the normal amount of time before being sent over to voicemail. However, this leaves the incoming call screen active and blocking whatever you were previously looking at.\n\nA: A qualified 'yes' (for iOS)\nPrior to iOS 14, to the best of my knowledge, no.\nThe call is either able to be answered (i.e. displayed on your screen,) or ignored (i.e. sent to voicemail,) thereby freeing-up your phone for other uses.\nWhat purpose would be served for the carrier to allow the caller to continue to hear ringing if there was no way for you to answer?\nUpdate for iOS version >=14\nHowever, since the introduction of iOS 14, you can now choose to have incoming calls display as a banner at the top of the screen instead of the full-screen display.\nIn the Settings app, under Phone there is, in the top section, an item called Incoming Calls.  If you select this, you may choose between Full Screen and Banner.  See this article for more details.\nWhile all of these nuances are academically interesting, I personally recommend using a call blocker/scanner tool.  These are widely available and can intercept your incoming calls and screen them for spam calls fairly effectively.  The one I use can even play custom recordings. I chose the 'disconnected tone' message in case some call bots might identify that sound and log the number as being out-of-service.\n\nA: Press ‘Remind Me’! The phone keeps ringing on the other end, and you get to move on with your life.\nEdit: No longer works as of iOS 12.2\nThe best solution now is to take a screenshot of the call dialog, hit share, then use the various options there (including shortcuts) to continue doing whatever you wanted to do. Email, and I think messaging, is still fully accessible, and I suspect there's a shortcut pattern that could give you web access, although I haven't found it yet.\n\nA: Pressing the power button once mutes a call but does not decline; it will stop ringing on your phone but will keep ringing on the caller's phone and not get sent to voicemail immediately. Two presses of the power button declines the call and sends it to voicemail.\nSource is my personal testing and this Apple Support forum question.\n", "Q: Installing MacOS via USB stick I have made a decision to install Mac OS from scratch so I have erased the disk part.(by cmd-r beginning of OS). Now, I'm using Windows(bootcamp). Is there any way to install Mac OS via USB stick and downloading, writing it into the USB on Windows?\n\nA: Yes, you can create a bootable USB that can automatically install OS X. It would mimic the functionality of the Recovery Disk option when booting. Here's a link from Macworld about how to do it with the latest version of OS X, Sierra. It's less complicated than it sounds. When you start your Mac, hold down the option key to choose the USB drive that you've created.\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/3092900/macs/how-to-create-a-bootable-macos-sierra-installer-drive.html\n", "Q: Login - Screen Flashes and Returns to Login Screen - Terminal Explanation I found this question Login - Screen Flashes and Returns to Login Screen - Tried Everything Possible, which is exactly like the problem I'm having.\nBut the answer confuses me....\n\nThere is one troubleshooting step that OS X shares with the classic Mac OS, removing preference files. But on OS X there are TWO folders:\n/Library/Preferences and ~/Library/Preferences\n--The latter being in your user/home folder--\nSince the issue doesn't exist under another logon it is specific to that user folder. SO there is something specific to that user that is causing the problem. This takes the /Library/Preferences folder out of consideration for troubleshooting preferences. The first thing I would do is use a utility like Onyx to verify and clean the system. This includes verifying preferences files. After that rename the ~/Library/Preferences folder to something like\n~/Library/Preferences-old\nYou'll probably have to do that in Terminal and use sudo as those files are owned by another user on the system. then create a new ~/Library/Preferences folder and reboot.\nIf you can now log into that account it is a simple (HAH!) matter of putting preferences files in the new Preferences folder and rebooting till you find which one it is.\nNo guarantee, though, that it is a preference file, it could be a startup item. So do the same thing with the ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder.\nThe other thing to consider is that it might be easier to just create a new user folder. Copy the things you need out of the old user folder and delete the old user. That could save you a lot of troubleshooting time. It would be my preferred way of doing it (after running Onyx) as I care less about what happened than just finding a fix that gets me up and running more quickly.\n\nHow would I go about doing this? I have terminal open, what do I type?\nMy computer is a hackintosh, I did not build it. This problem just happened suddenly.\n\nA: To rename the folders you listed in Terminal you would use the move command or \"mv\". Like this: (I will use an account called \"userx\" for this example)\nsudo mv /Users/userx/Library/Preferences /Users/userx/Library/PreferencesOLD\nsudo mv /Users/userx/Library/LaunchAgents /Users/userx/Library/LaunchAgentsOLD\n\nTo create directories in Terminal use \"mkdir\"\nsudo mkdir /Users/userx/Library/Preferences\n\nLastly, the step they skip is allowing \"userx\" to use the new directory you need to make userx the owner of any new folders you create in this manner.\nsudo chown userx /Users/userx/Library/Preferences\n\n", "Q: iOS 10 Proactive App Suggestions are Missing Now that I've upgraded my iPhone SE to iOS 10 (version 10.0.2), the proactive app suggestions are gone.\nWhat I mean by proactive app suggestions: in iOS 9, when I'd plug in my headphones or connect a bluetooth speaker, a small gray app icon would appear in the lower left of the lock screen or, in the app switcher, a gray app suggestion tab would appear along the bottom of the screen. This would usually be exactly the app I'd want to start using on my iPhone.\nThe proactive app suggestions feature was very handy. I wish it still existed in iOS 10.

The closest I could find was a report of a bug in a UI framework written in Python, but so close in behavior that for a second (or a couple, or more ;-)) I had to question myself if it's really a coincidence (I now, I now..).\nSee https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues/5058\nThere they describe (almost?) exactly what I believe is happening here: Scrolling generates a mouse up event for previously pressed button.\nTo verify, you can try this: on a browser, press and hold the right button. Then move the mouse over an option of the pop-up menu (say, \"back\"), then scroll the wheel. The option is selected, as if you had released the button.\nThe same is occurring with text selection. Do this: with mouse left-click-and-hold, select some text, \"freeze any mouse movements\" (explain later), then scroll down (but not too much, keep the already selected text visible). The text that remains selected is only the one who was selected just before the scroll movement (as if you had released the button just before start scrolling). Then stop scrolling, hold shift, and do some mouse movement. In response to the smallest move, the text between is automatically added to the selection, and after this you can even release the shift, no matter anymore, go keep moving the mouse (provided that you don't move the scroll) to continue tuning selection. This is exactly what should have happened if you had released the button just before start scrolling (aka mouse up event), do some scroll, then pressed/hold shift, and next clicked/hold again the mouse button, to do the final mouse selection movements.\nThe only catch is that, if while holding the button and after some scrolling (who \"wrongly\" generated a mouse button up event), you do any mouse movement, in response to this move, (maybe in an attempt) to honor the fact that the you are still holding the button, the system immediately generates a mouse button down event.\nThat's why you think the scroll de-selects the text: normally, when someone do some scroll to add selection, do without moving the mouse, but tends to make some final mouse movements after the scroll, tu adjust the end of the selection. Try holding the button, make some selection thru moving, freeze mouse movement, scroll (keep freezing), release button, move mouse (note, the selection don't go away), then shift + click/hold, when the mouse reach the destination point. Since you released the button just before restarting mouse movements, when you do the new moves, the system will not generate a mouse button down event, once there is no need to \"honor\" this state (after all, the button is already up).\nIt's not the scroll who de-selects the text: it's the mouse movement, after scrolling, while keeping the mouse button down.\nI think it's an attempt to maintain/regain system consistency, since the last info passed thru was, essentially, wrong: the mouse button up event, as a consequence of a scroll movement, should never been occurred.\nI'm going to report this to logitech, maybe if presented with some more tech explanation they will fix the problem. (God, is so painful to use they site send a simple message, anyone knows a easier way?)\n\nA: 2021, I was getting similar issues with Logitech M510 (firmware 62.00.0013), Logitech Options 8.36.76 and LCC 3.9.8 on macOS Mojave 10.14.6. It also happened when trying to move windows around.\nFixed by uninstalling LCC (Logitech Control Center).\n\nA: Similar issues with MX Anywhere 2(Big Sur 11.2), installing Logitech Control Center solved my problem. Although it tells \"No logitech Device Found\".\n", "Q: What do you call a home page on an app? Could it be called landing, or profile, or main ?

Start by looking at proxy settings.\nI'm hoping you found a solution by now.  Just in case this helps anyone, I'm going to share what worked for me.  I had no problem browsing the web with Firefox or Chrome, but the App Store just showed a grey window like the screenshot in the original post.\nDuring troubleshooting, I discovered that Safari couldn't connect to any web servers.  This suggested that the problem had something to do with the Mac's network settings.  I opened the network settings, selected my network adapter, clicked Advanced, went to the Proxies tab, and unchecked Automatic Proxy Configuration.  That fixed everything.\n\nA: Here is a tutorial from a guy who fixed what seems like the same issue you are experiencing:\nCheck this out \nI also recommend you change your time zone to anywhere but your current location, restarting and then choosing \"Set time zone automatically using current location\" (Date & Time Preferences). \nMany times this resolved a few Mac OS (X) issues for me.  \nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: iOS 10 my clock alarms only play twice In iOS 9 my clock alarms repeated for an hour but in iOS 10 only play twice. My iPhone 6plus is so big and heavy it pulls my pants down if I wear it in a belt holster, so I often set it on the table. \nI have a critical health condition requiring different medications every 3 hours. If I am out of the room or more important when I am asleep,  I don't always hear the first or second play of the alarm. It repeats but only one time, and when sleeping, that is often not a long enough play. \nIn iOS 9, it played up to an hour and I found that necessary and extremely useful. When we went from iOS 7 to iOS 8, the same thing happened and a lot of people complained and it was fixed in the first iOS 8 update. \nCan you fix it in the iOS 9 update so it repeats many more times. People usually use this to wake them and twice is not enough if you are in a deep sleep then. \n\nA: Which version of iOS 10 are you running?

Curiously the issue appeared after upgrading the iOS version on my iPad (whereas the issue occurs on my MacBook; my iPad has never exhibited any messages-related issues). \nI tried @brian-m's suggestion of moving the OldMessages folder back (after steps 3 and 6 above); sure enough I can see my old messages just fine but the original problem is immediately reintroduced. So it's some sort of database issue. I had a bit more of a poke around and can see it's a SQLite database. There's a good discussion of the schema here. Unfortunately I don't have time to delve further.\n\nA: Further research turned up nothing (either cause or potential fixes).

What can I do now? here we have another beautiful case of \"Don't expect your Mac to be reliable by itself\" What happened is as follows:\nI decided to encrypt all my data. Since I have a second hard drive in my MacBook I have my home drive on it, and hence not on the same drive as the OS. Encrypting the drive with the OS was easily solved via FileVault. Once that was done I checked online to see if I can encrypt the home drive as well, and found the solution to just right click and press \"Encrypt.\"\nAt this point I assumed Mac OS will have some sort of system recognizing the fact that my home folder is on that drive and will handle the encryiption accordingly. I was WRONG. And now I can`t log in ... From what I can tell this is due to the fact that the home drive is not loaded prior to logging in (and on the other hand is necessary to log in).\nHas anyone got an idea how I can handle this situation?\nThanks!\nTired greetings,\nAlex\n\nA: Unfortunately, that's just how it works currently.

How can I recover Admin1? Admin2 doesn't have the rights to create another account. Guest account is also turned off.\n\nA: This happens all the time. Upgrades don't intentionally delete any user data, but when you have corruption, upgrade time is when major changes cause you to rewrite data on disk and loss is checked or noticed. \nYou can restore from a backup or make a backup of what is now on the disk and then try an erase install. If you are missing something as large as a user account, who knows what else is missing and unstable. Best to wipe and start cleanly after making a backup. \nAlso, I wouldn't try to fix anything - trying to make a new admin account could lose you even more data.

I’m currently thinking about buying paid iCloud storage, because I’ve got several directories on my Mac which I’d like to have backed up that way.\nMy first look at iCloud was disillusioning, however. \nObviously it isn't possible to upload whole directories via the web interface. Only single files. An alternative would be making compressed directories. But that option isn't great.\nIs there a software application for desktop with which one can upload single directories?\nI’d like to trigger the upload via the right-click context menu or something similar, and have the upload take place in the background. Ideally such an app would also “watch” the selected folder and keep it synchronized with iCloud.\nIs this possible in the current state of iCloud Drive, and does a solution exist?\n\nA: iCloud Drive on your Mac will upload the contents of your iCloud folder, including all subdirectories, to iCloud.\nIt is not possible to cherry-pick folders to exclude within your iCloud folder, or folders to include outside of it. Everything inside the iCloud folder gets synced with iCloud every time it changes, and that’s all.\nStarting with macOS 10.12 Sierra, you may also specify the Desktop and Documents folders to be synced to iCloud. But those are the only exceptions. I believe the way this works is the original folders are replaced with symbolic links, and the actual folders moved into your iCloud Drive (I don’t use this feature, so I haven’t verified this myself).\n", "Q: macOS Sierra USB Issues Has anyone faced any issues with the external hard drives or pen-drives not being detected on a MacBook that has been upgraded to macOS Sierra 10.12?\n\nA: I own a brand new MacBook Pro 2016 and many external devices are not working or not even recognized anymore. For instance my Presonus audiobox USB audio interface is not working anymore. \nI contacted Presonus and they told me it has to do with lower power to the USB ports. Supposedly Apple is trying to extend battery life this way. \n\nA: No. This isn't a known issue on Sierra.

So after 5 years I've decided to switch to Android and I have almost 100GB of music stored on Apple's servers after uploading them there via the paid iCloud Music service. I want to download the high quality versions of my music on iCloud onto an external drive so I can then subsequently worry about getting them all onto the equivalent Android music service.\nCan anyone suggest a way of doing this that will not involve downloading every track individually (and possibly losing my mind in the process)?\n\nA: Open iTunes. Create a smart group that includes music that is not on your computer (location = iCloud). Make sure the group has live updating. Create a second group that includes music where iCloud status is \"matched\", file location is on your computer, and quality is under 256 Kbps. Again, ensure live updating.\nIn the second group, select all and delete the tracks - but do NOT delete from iCloud, only locally (you'll get a pop-up - it will ask if you also want to delete from iCloud - DO NOT choose yes!!). This should clear all low-quality local files for anything in Apple Music.\nGo back to the first list. Select all and click the cloud icon to download the files locally. Keep doing this until this list is empty (that is, there are no tracks left that are only saved in iCloud).\nGo to your Music folder. Everything you have in your iTunes library will be here (~/Music/iTunes, probably in a subdirectory such as \"iTunes Media\"). Copy everything here to an external drive. That should do it.\nNote that you can ignore any files in the iTunes Media folder that are not music, such as iOS apps. Also note that some media will not transfer to another platform (iTunes album extras, some video content). You may also want to check for DRM on any older tracks - you can remove DRM by selecting the file and choosing \"Create AAC Version\" to make a copy with no rights management, or (for matched files) deleting the local copy and re-downloading it from iCloud.\n", "Q: How to change default Memories photo in Apple Photo app I would like to change the default memories photo in the Photos app on my iPhone and Mac. When Photos creates memories, it will sometimes choose a photo as the banner photo that I don't want. Even after I edit the Memories movie and remove the photo, it still shows that photo.\nSeems like the only way to \"solve\" this problem is to delete the photo altogether, hide it, or delete the memory, which I don't want to do. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!\n\nA: To change, click on the person who you want to modify,  then press \"Select\" and click on the photo you want to change it to. \nThen press the \"Share\" button and scroll across to where it says \"Set Key Face.\" Press this and that photo will be the main photo for that person.\nOn iOS 12 - the thumbnail for memories is gone, so perhaps that will happen in Photos on macOS or the web interface to photos so you don't have to mess with curating the hidden attribute of a photo you want out of the \"featured\" image rotation. Hopefully adding new memories lets those photos you want to see rotate in as the main placeholder, but there's no direct way to choose that today.\n", "Q: What is the best way to automate PDF page extraction and conversion into jpg for downloaded files in iOS? From time to time I need to check a webpage, download a PDF file from there, find something inside, extract that page and convert it to an image. I can do it easily on macOS, but on iOS it gets more complicated. It would be great if I could on the way, using my iPhone.\nI have been trying a way to do it using the apps I know. My last try was with Workflow, but it seems that it does not support PDF to JPG conversion. I may try to write some code in Pythonista and it can probably work out, but i would prefer a simpler solution.

There is a yellow square in every note, and if I remove the note using the inspector, the yellow squares doesn't go away: \n\nI need to print this document and it's unusable with all these yellow squares. How do I remove them?\nPS: I already removed the notes, but there are still yellow squares.\n\nA: None of these solutions worked for me, but probably because I was using a windows keyboard, which others might have. So maybe this will help someone.\nWith a windows keyboard what worked was to:\nIf the yellow square is now minimized to a small square, just click it once and then click the BACKSPACE key... NOT the DELETE key.\nSo backspace is the action you want, not forward delete. Coming from Windows this change in backspace vs delete when using a native MacBook pro keyboard was a little confusing.\n*** NOTE - If the yellow square is opened large, just click anywhere outside of the square and it will shrink to a small yellow square, and then you can do as I said.\n\nA: I figured it out!\nMove it and then press \"delete\" without clicking anywhere else. You have to move it instead of trying to select it\n\nA: Here is how you can remove the notes from the linked document.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the linked document in Preview.\n\n*control click on the note icon and select Delete Annotation.\n\n\nOr:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the linked document in Preview.\n\n*Click the note icon, which opens the note.\n\n*Press the esc key to dismiss the note but leave the note icon highlighted.\n\n*Press the delete key.\n\n\nOr:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the linked document in Preview.\n\n*Click: Preview > Tools > Show Inspector\n\n*Click: Annotations Inspector\n\n*Click the Type column, so all the notes are at the top.\n\n*Select all the notes, then press the delete key.\n\n\n\nI've uploaded a modified copy of the linked document here.\n\nA: I had this happen just now and nothing worked. I had to first quit preview, then re-open the document.

The app I used was WPS office which could open nearly all kinds of files, for example, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF, Mindmap files, just name a few.

I think that will show the latest OS version independent of what is installed on your system. If it is coming up as an update, in the \"updates\" tab, that's a different story - if so, install it, otherwise ignore it, it's just an advertisement.\n", "Q: Upgrading from Yosemite to El Capitan, but not Sierra We have an older iMac (Model A1311, Mid 2011).

Its my wife's computer, its older, and I really don't want to be debugging Sierra until a few  more \"dot\" releases come out.\n\nA: You don't have to upgrade to macOS Sierra if you don't want to.\nAlready \"Own\" El Capitan\nIf you have already \"purchased\" El Capitan, then it will show up under the \"Purchased\" tab of the App Store.  By \"purchased\" I mean the \"free download\" that Apple provided.\n\nDownload from the AppStore\nPer Apple Support, you can download El Capitan directly from the AppStore\n\nGo to an Apple Store\nIf you still can't download, you can take a visit to an Apple Store near you, or you could have a friend download it (if they already purchased it) and make a USB installer.\n\nA: Apple has a support document specifically for this: Upgrade to OS X El Capitan\n\nA: None of this works if your machine CAN upgrade to Sierra.

I've used Activity Monitor to close every process with the Creative Cloud icon.\nI've deleted the Creative Cloud Files directory itself, and deleted it from the trash.\nI've gone to the \"Extensions\" preference pane and turned off \"Core Sync.\"\nI've quit Finder and restarted it.\nAnd yet the \"Creative Cloud Files\" icon still shows up in my Finder sidebar, even though the original can't be found.\nHow can I eliminate this zombie icon once and for all?\n\nA: This is how you show / hide certain icons of the Finder Sidebar:\nTry a right-click on the folder, then 'Remove from Sidebar'.\n1) Go to 'Finder', then open 'Preferences' from the menu bar\n\n2) Navigate to the 'Sidebar' tab\n\n3) Uncheck the appropriate icon(s) as required. Then close.\nI believe that apps like CCleaner can clean up these \"ghost\" directories too. However, based on your question, these steps should do the job. Let me know how you get on.\n\nA: Apparently one of the actions I mentioned in the question actually did solve the issue, but it required an actual log out and log in before it took effect.  Relaunching Finder wasn't enough.\n\nA: If you want to REMOVE Creative Cloud completely from your mac there is a uninstaller link run it on your mac and it will be gone. (This is from adobe website: helpx.adobe.com So it's ok)\nFor more info go to Creative Page link\n\nA: The solution is as follows.\n1) Go to the preferences in the Creative Cloud app and turn off file sync.\n\n2) Go to your home folder and delete the Creative Cloud folder.\n3) Relaunch Finder by pressing CMD + ALT + ESC, select Finder and press Relaunch.\n\n", "Q: My battery cycle count surpassed 1000 (MacBook Pro Retina Late 2012) It already passed 1000 cycle counts, and it doesn't say to replace yet. When I check the condition it states \"Normal.\"\nI already order a new battery, because I was under the impression after I reach the limit of cycles count I would need to replace the battery. I restarted my Mac to see if it changes the conditions, but it did not. It still shows \"Normal\".\nShould I replace the battery anyways with the new or wait until it says \"Condition: Replace\" \n\nA: Lithium batteries lose capacity over time, as you recharge them. Your MacBook can sustain 1000 recharge cycles and still retain 80% of its original capacity (more or less).\nWhat this means is that if your battery originally held 10000 mAh, then in its current state of wear and tear it now holds 8000 mAh (80% of original). When you charge it up to 100%, you're now only charging it to 8000 mAh. Your battery has shrunk by 20%, so to speak.\nWhat this means is your battery drains a little faster than before. But unless the lowered capacity truly bothers you, you've still got some time to go before you need to replace it. If you were okay with it at 81% of original capacity, I doubt you’ll notice a difference at 79% or 75% of original capacity.\nReplace your battery when your laptop can no longer operate long enough to accommodate your needs without having to plug in, or when System Information advises you to replace it. If you always use your MacBook while plugged in, you likely won't need to replace its battery before you want to buy a new laptop entirely.\n1000 cycles isn't a \"limit,\" only a reference. You can go through many more cycles than that.\n\nA: No worries, my late 2009 MacBook has just surpassed 2000 battery cycles and still has 75% health. :)\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Support for 3840 x 1600 (and higher) resolutions Does the MacBook Pro retina display (late 2013) have support for displays with 3840 x 1600 (WQHD+) (LG example shown below). \nIf so, at what refresh rate and through what port? \n\n\nA: You can use even higher 4k resolution (different monitor) via DisplayPort. You can even connect two monitors, 60Hz.\nCheck Amazon Q&A for similar or higher monitors:\n\nYou can actually run 2 of these at full 3840x2160 at 60Hz on a late 2013 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina! You can't daisychain them, but if both of your display ports are free, you can connect 2 of them and they look amazing!\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Dell-Monitor-P2715Q-27-Inch-LED-Lit/\nMacbook Pro late 2013 Retina (15 inches) can run at 3841x2160 with help of third-party utilities.\nAnd NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB official site provides even higher specs.\n\nA: Using these three sites:\nApple display site, Apple Insider site, and MBPr site, I have what I believe to be the correct answer. Using HDMI, you should be able to use a WQHD+ screen at 30Hz. Apple Insider's site recommends the LG 34UM88-P. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that you computer supports 4K at anything higher than 30Hz. Please let me know if any of the information stated is incorrect. I would recommend finding a store that stocks the monitor you are looking to buy, and asking them if you can bring in your laptop and an HDMI cord to test the monitor and make sure it is compatible with your computer.\n", "Q: Finder crashes and cannot be relaunched (El Capitan, 2010 Macbook Air) Model: Macbook Air (11\", Late 2010, 1.6 GHz)\nOS: El Capitan 10.11.6\nProblem: Whenever I try to shut down or restart my Mac, Finder crashes and then nothing else happens. The computer continues to function, except without Finder. The menu bar disappears until I start another app (from the dock). I've tried relaunching Finder from the dock but nothing happens. I've also tried relaunching it via command + option + esc but that doesn't work either. The only way I can bring Finder back is to force restart the computer by holding down the power button.\nThere are some other odd symptoms, too, like that whenever I get a notification for an update I'll click update and then nothing will happen. I've found that when I restart and get to the login screen I can shut down and restart normally from there.\nBesides these things the computer functions normally. I just can't get it to shut down or restart normally.\nAny ideas of what might be going on? I can paste an EtreCheck if that would be helpful. Thanks in advance.\nNote: What I'm experiencing seems to be identical to the problem described in this unanswered question. As recommended by a commenter, I've tried creating a new account but it has the same problems I've described above.\n\nA: Okay, I figure you have two options.\nOPTION 1 - Delete Finder preferences\nLet's delete Finder preferences first and see if that solves your problem. Since you can't launch the Finder, you will have to do this using the Terminal. Follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (it's in the Applications > Utilities folder).\n\n*Delete the primary Finder preferences file by typing this at the Terminal prompt exactly as I've typed it: rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\n*Press Return\n\n*Since you're running El Capitan you will also need to delete the preferences for the Finder Sidebar by typing this at the Terminal prompt exactly as I've typed it: rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\n*Press Return\n\n*Log out, then in again.\n\n*Empty the Trash.\n\n\nHopefully this solves the problem. If not, proceed to Option 2.\nOPTION 2 - Replace the Finder app\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually go to your Time Machine backup drive.\n\n*Select a backup date you know was after you updated to El Capitan 10.11.6 and before you started having problems. \n\n*Within your backup drive, navigate to the Finder app. This should be located at: Backups.backupdb > 'your computer' > 'backup date' > Macintosh HD > System > Library > CoreServices > Finder (Note: Your HD may be a different name to Macintosh HD).\n\n*Double-check that the version of Finder is actually 10.11.4 (that's the version for El Capitan 10.11.6).\n\n*Select and Copy the Finder app.\n\n*Now, navigate to the CoreServices folder on your main HD. This should be located at: Macintosh HD > System > Library > CoreServices (Note: Your HD may be a different name to Macintosh HD).\n\n*Paste the Finder app into this location.\n\n\nHopefully this solves the problem. If not, you could try Option 1 again now that you've replaced the Finder.\nLet us know how you go.\n[EDIT]\nOption 3 - Test Startup/Login items\nOkay, I'm adding this option based on the fact that the Finder seems to operate normally when your computer starts in Safe Mode.\nThis tells me it's likely to be something that's getting loaded during normal startup (e.g. a Startup/Login item, a font you've installed) that's causing the problem. \nSo I would now startup normally and go to System Preferences > Users & Groups. Take a note of your Login Items and then remove all of them and restart your computer (Finder should still crash) so that it starts again without those login items loading. Test this and see if the problem persists. \nIf the problem does persist, I'd then remove any fonts you've installed yourself.\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: I've learned that this specific problem can have many different causes. Mine appears to have been caused by an old install of ProTools. Following the directions in this answer fixed my restart problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem yesterday. Suddenly my machine tried to shut down but remained in a black screen... Hard booted (by keeping power-button pressed fir ~5 seconds) and after the O/S booted finder kept crashing, showing a crash-report dialog. Click the dialog away and it would crash again. \nLaunching anything (e.g. a terminal) without a working finder or menu-bar is problematic. Cortana wasn't working, neither was much of the config-settings screen, nor spotlight. Booting in safe-mode resulted in the same finder crash.\nI solved it by rebooting the mac and keeping COMMAND+R pressed until the logo appears. It then will give you the option to reinstall macOS.\nLeave the partitions as-is (do NOT deleted them) and then simply reinstall the OS (just take \"the same\" as which was installed - in my case macOS Sierra). Took ~30 minutes and afterwards my data and apps were still there, same for the user-account. I could simply login to my existing user-account and everything was fine again.\n", "Q: My MBP freeze on a Back-Up after having installed a SSD I'm having a MBP (mid 2012, 13 inches), and I changed my HDD for a Samsung V-Nand SSD 850 EVO.

When browsing Facebook via the iOS app one often browses websites through the app. Some websites need login and since the FB app doesn't support password handlers it's a difficult login process. \nSo any suggestion about how to handle this the easiest way? \nI'd wish one could automatically open all sites in Safari at least if FB doesn't want to support password handlers. \n\nA: This is a design decision by Facebook, and the best you can do is go into Settings → Safari → Passwords, where you can copy/paste your passwords into the Facebook browser to log into individual websites.\nYou can also specify a text replacement string for your email address under Settings → General → Keyboard → Text Replacements, so you can enter it more quickly into the Facebook app.\n\nA: I've turn on Keychain in iCloud Settings. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085\nAfterwards save the Facebook ID and Password.

I was managing my disk space and decided to shrink one of my partitions (the one with Mavericks) because it had more free disk space, in order to transfer this space into my main drive (the one with El Capitan).\nAs I couldn't just transfer space from Mavericks to El Capitan I shrank my Mavericks partition, but then my total disk space was reduced.

And it works just fine copying files and it show on my mac until the unmounting processes begin\nPPPS I noticed that the pendrive does not have a GUID_partition_scheme as the others\n\nIs there any other way I fix this?\n\nA: Try formatting the USB stick twice as HFS+ (journaled)/GPT. Then use DiskMaker X to write the image. This is a piece of software that is updated very often and usually doesn't have any bugs (at least to my knowledge), so it might work better than the app you are using now. If nothing helps, then you probably have a broken USB stick - go buy something like a SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 (I have it and it works great).\n\nA: Solved using an external HD.\nSeems that if GUID_partition_scheme is not present, pendrive will not work as bootable.\n", "Q: Unlock a locked 32GB iPad I have an iPad (32GB) and have been locked out because I couldn't remember the passcode.\nWhat can I do?\nI have never associated it with an iTunes account but want to get the pictures off it (which do not appear in iCloud)  \nIs there anything I can do?\n\nA: I am assuming by 'iTunes account' you are referring to an 'iCloud account'.\nPhotos won't appear in iCloud for that reason (no account to sync with).\nNo iCloud account associated with the iPad means no backup location to restore from or other form of cloud storage.\nYou may use iTunes to reset your iPad to factory default or restore it from a backup (should you have one) while the iPad is in recovery mode.\nThere are already tutorials specifically outlining every step of this process, hence I won't post them here.\nThis is just one of the 100+ available on YouTube: Video Tutorial\nAt this moment I am unsure if this answers your question or not, as I can't quite make out the actual question(s).

This has been going on for weeks now.\nI am a software developer and am using MacOS Sierra Version 10.12 with a Mac Pro (Late 2013), 3.5 Ghz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 with 16GB 1866 Mhz DDR3, AMD FirePro D300 2048 MB.\nI've read some issues of people having this problem here (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5555689?start=0&tstart=0), but the discussion is outdated.\n1.) I disconnected from internet and left the computer on all night, the folder appearing still occurs.\n2.) I have no screen sharing computer control apps\n3.) I've looked into a fix where you delete the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist but that file does not appear to exist??\nPlease any ideas are appreciated as its very annoying how it fills up the desktop every morning.  I'm not sure how to reproduce the error on command yet.\nAttached is only plist files I could find.  I'll upload screenshot of untitled folders tomorrow or when it happens again.\n\n\n\n\nA: Ok so I finally figured out the issue (at least for me).  It turns out that some games when you have multiple monitors do not use true full screen and so right clicking can create accidental new folders to appear on the desktop.\nIn particular the game League of Legends was culprit in this.  I found out after doing some more research and noticing this only seemed to occur after the game.  There does not appear to be a remedy for this yet.\n\nA: The desktop preferences you wanted to delete at: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist are not located in the root Library folder of your hard drive. Instead you need to navigate within your user home folder at Home/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist\nIf you don't know how to see the Library folder, within the Finder hold down the Option key and click on the Go menu and then select Library from the menu. This will open up the Library folder for you and then you can just navigate to Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist\nLet us know if this works for you.\n", "Q: Empty trash with open files, MacOs Sierra I'm watching a movie in VLC and, while the movie is playing, I can move it to the trash and empty it. \nAt no point MacOs tries to warning me about anything. The movie continues to play, even after I emptied the trash. But if I pause it, the sound goes missing.\nSame goes for any other file...\nDoes this happens to anyone else? Is this the expected behavior?\n\nA: VLC maintains its own cache of media that it is playing. This means if the original media is temporarily unavailable, such as on a network drive over a poor network connection, the file can continue playing for a while until the network connection is re-established. This also means VLC isn't accessing the actual file, meaning VLC can play partially downloaded media, but also means you can delete the file without Finder complaining that the file is in use.\n", "Q: Arrow sign appearing in top bar after upgrading to OS X El Capitan After upgrading my Mac's OS to OS X El Capitan, an arrow sign appearing in top bar, Nothing happens whenever I click on this icon.\n\n\nA: Yes, it's VMWare Fusion.

One AirPort is advertised to support 50 devices, so I'm using 4 AirPorts currently for 200 devices.\nMy setup consists of 1 AirPort in DHCP and NAT mode, and the remaining AirPorts in Bridge mode.\nNow, I'd like to extend the network capacity to 400-ish devices.\nOne issue I see is that AirPort Utility only supports setting DHCP ranges within a /24 subnet, meaning that there is a maximum of around 250 devices possible.\nIt is important that all devices share the same subnet, because the used application requires UDP broadcasts to communicate with other peers.\nIt is also important that roaming (i.e. moving around in the room and reconnecting to other base stations without disconnects) is possible. This works fine with my 4 AirPort setup so far.\nWhat is the preferred way to create a larger than default subnet (e.g. /23) using Apple AirPort Extreme?\n\nA: I would get an edge router and place your AirPort devices in bridge mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubiquiti makes a nice one - EdgeRouter X\n\n*TP Link makes a nice one - TL-R600VPN\nAirPort does a lot of things right - it doesn't have enough horsepower to manage more than 256 addresses - so let it do the things it does well like manage Bonjour sleep proxy and get a router to do routing and DNS/DHCP. You get bonus QOS and VPN features on these edge routers that will help you manage access in and out. That many clients will kill your network connection upstream if you don't have visibility and controls.\nIn my opinion, Apple chose wisely to not enable more clients than its hardware can manage. There's no use case where I can see you being happy with 200+ clients being routed by Apple gear.\n\nA: The maximum number of addresses you can have on a /24 subnet is 256, so you are right on target with having 250 or so.  This includes the IP for the gateway, and the broadcast, so, you are now down to 254.\nFor example, using a Class C subnet with a mask of /24 your range will be \n192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255\nThis is not a limitation of the Airport, but of the IP network itself.  What you can do is change the netmask so it will allow more IP's within the given subnet:\n255.255.254.0 \nWill allow a subnet with up to 508 clients.\n192.168.0.1 to 192.168.1.255 \n\nTotally opinionated section....\nIf you are managing this many devices/clients on a network, Airport is NOT something I would use.  I would look at getting \"Enterprise Grade\" networking gear like Ubiquiti UniFi Pro with much better management capabilities.  They even have a \"lite\" version in which the all the controller software and config is centralized.\n", "Q: Mission Control won't open with dual monitor I am experiencing some really annoying issues when using a secondary display on my 13-inch Retina Macbook Pro with OSX 10.12 (Sierra).\nI use two different external displays (one at a time): my iPad Mini with the Duet app and an LG M2550D with an hdmi cable. In both cases, Mission Control is not opening when I have the secondary screen plugged in. I tried disabling and enabling Mission Control, rebooting the computer, reinstalling Duet, changing the hdmi cable for the monitor and nothing has worked. I also tried using the trackpad gesture, the mouse button I have assigned for this and the keyboard F3. \nAlso, when I'm using the LG monitor, my mouse won't work as well (as if it is unplugged). When I unplug the hdmi cable, the mouse \"starts working again\". It is a Logitech MX Performance.\nCan you help me? I really don't know what else to do.\nThank you very much.\n\nA: Mission control not opening is caused by Duet disabling it due to a bug in Sierra. I've just done a Google and found that apparently the bug is fixed in OSX 10.12.2 which is in beta and hopefully released soon.\n", "Q: First MacBook - am stuck I've unboxed a MacBook Pro and am stuck at the very beginning.

On the builtin MacBook Air keyboard it works, while on an old external Apple keyboard (M7803) I've the problem that the key which usually produces a backtick (`, i.e. the one left to the z on a US keyboard) doesn't work, producing a § instead.\nShowing the Keyboard Viewer displays the backtick in its proper place (clicking it with the mouse also works), but as soon as I type a character, the keyboard layout shown changes (having no key left of the z) and the backtick moves to the key left of the number 1. Actually pressing the key left to the 1 actually produces a backtick, so I guess I could get used to that...\nBut what's going on here? Why are the ` and § keys switched on the internal and external keyboards? The odd behaviour of the external keyboard started appearing only when I upgraded from El Capitan to Sierra.\n\nA: Turns out this was caused by Karabiner, I commented on this issue there.\n", "Q: installing node via homebrew vs package I i initially installed node via the package download at https://nodejs.org/en/.a \nThis has served me well as I have built numerous projects. However recently I have been reading a tutorial that instructs me to install node via \"brew install node\"\nDo I really need to? Is this considered a separate installation of node? does it serve a different purpose than the one I installed via a package?\n\nA: For just running javascript you are just using node and npm etc. It does not matter how you installed them.\nThey would be separate installs of node and which one you get depends on your PATH environment variable.\nThe tutorial justs gives Homebrew as a different installation probably because the user manages other packages (e.g. git) by Homebrew and it is easier to use one package manager rather than go for a separate different install for each package.\n", "Q: Should I buy DDR3 or DDR3L RAM for late 2012 MacBook pro 13 inch?

Is there a compatibility problem? I have tried all the usual remedies without success. \n\nA: Yes, there's a compatibility problem. Notes were upgraded in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan, and you can't sync between OS versions from before and after the upgrade. You'll need to upgrade your Mac to El Capitan or Sierra (which you should do anyway, since Mavericks will soon stop getting security fixes, if it hasn't already).\nAs a workaround, you can use a web browser to access notes in the cloud via web app. It’s not as convenient as the native app, but you can get at the notes from https://icloud.com\n\nA: Use Fluid to create a fake Notes App\nFollowing @Mike Scott suggestion of using a web browser to manage the Notes in your iCloud account,\nI would recommend using Fluid to create a fake Notes App.\nThis is how I am doing right now in my very old MacBook while I wait for the arrangement of my Mac.\nIn fact, I really enjoyed this method so much that I also created a Fluid App for the Reminders.\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download here the last version of Fluid compatible with Mavericks.\n\n*Install as usual and launch the application.\n\n*In the URL field introduce this: https://icloud.com/#notes2\n\n*In the Name Field introduce, for example, \"Notes (Fluid)\".\n\n*Create the App.\n\n\nOptional but handy\n\n\n*Start the app \"Notes (Fluid)\" and open its Preferences.\n\n*Under \"General\" change the App icon: browse for some image, or better, just select the built-in Notes App.\n\n*Under \"Behavior\" ensure \"only hides the windows\" is selected.\n\n\nPS:\nYou can use this Fluid App like a browser; thus you can create new tabs to manage a different notes in the same Window.\n\n\n\nA: Don't sync the Notes app with iCloud, use a different service instead!\nWhen I first downgraded to Mavericks, I had been using iCloud to sync Notes for a couple of years, and I also discovered I could no longer keep Notes in sync between my Mac and my iPhone.\nSo, I migrated to syncing Notes with my Google account.

I connected two MacBook Pro's (if it matters, one using Big Sur and the other Mojave) directly via Ethernet and configured them with manual IP addresses, and when I started the Migration Assistant it STILL defaulted to using WiFi for the transfer.  I had to go into the System Preferences/Network on both computers and REMOVE the Wifi adapter in order to get Migration Assistant to connect via Ethernet.  Maybe deleting 1 of them would have been sufficient, but I wasn't in the mood for experimentation after 24hrs of waiting for Migration Assistant to do something over WiFi...\nUPDATE: While what I stated above did supposedly allow the Migration Wizard to make the connection via Ethernet, after another near 24 hours of Migration Wizard stuck on the \"Deciding what can be transferred\" screen, I gave up and just created the account on the new computer and transferred the files manually.  :-|\n\nA: Something else to consider is turning off sharing restrictions on any anti-virus software you may have (I know sacrilegious on a Mac but I’m paranoid).\nI got it working by turning:\nOff firewall\nOn all sharing options\nOff any viruses protection settings related to file sharing.\nWorked after that, now I just have to wait 24 hrs\n", "Q: merge folder trees on OSX by moving, not copying them It's backup time, and I've been trying to merge two big directory trees on the same (physical) partition, with lots levels of depth.

So my last resort was through Google, where I found several options on where to download OS X El Capitan version 10.11.\nSo, my main question is if I download from these third party websites, can I install on top of my current OS like it is done through the App Store or do I have to do a clean install?\nWould appreciate any help.\n\nA: You have installed Yosemite before, look in the AppStore whether Yosemite is in your purchased items. This is one Option to install Yosemite and upgrade to El Capitan.\nYou can download El Capitan with this direct link from App Store. But I'm not sure whether this link work for you, try it. \nCannot offer other download links because many sites where you can download this are not clear trusted sites.\nThird Option, went to next appstore or similar Mac shop and get a copy of El Capitan if possible. You have also the option to contact the Apple Support.\n\nA: Installers on OS X / macOS do not go back. \nYou have to make a backup, then wipe the OS and install from the installer of choice. You can upgrade, not downgrade. See this linked article for ideas downloading and locating older OS versions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download El Capitan Installer now that Sierra is out\n", "Q: Update to iOS 8 will not work for 4s Ok, this is the weirdest thing ever.\nSo I have a 4s and i can't update it past 7.1.2. I tried everything but it won't work. It is said that the iphone 4s can update to ios 8 (via apple support) but it won't work. On this site it says that it can't but that's not possible cause my friend has a 4s too and she's already at like 9.3. There might be a bug in the software that causes that for me but the issue is growing so i am just puzzled and I am sad cause i want free starbucks but i can't get it. ( starbucks rewards needs 8 or higher.)\n\nA: It’s almost certain your device is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*failing and in need of hardware repair\n\n*not 4s and actually 4\n\n\nYou can verify the model number or call Apple support to be sure you have a 4s and then see about arranging service if restore attempts fail repeatedly. \n", "Q: Original El Capitan 10.11.0? I'm looking to upgrade my Yosemite system with El Capitan but I can only find 10.11.1 versions. Need the original. Any help? Any thoughts?\n\nA: Assuming you \"purchased\" El Capitan during it's availability you can download it from the App Store in the usual way. You will actually get 10.11.6 - there are no reasons to install 10.11.0, and Apple does not have an all-versions archive.\nIf you did not get El Capitan while it was available then you can't get it. Sierra is the current offering, but wait a few weeks for 10.12.1.\n\nA: Apple doesn't serve up downloads of older builds of OS from the Mac App Store, so you will have to save your copies for reuse as they are current. I would try downloading whatever version of OS X from the App Store you have.\nEven a paid developer can't easily re-download older versions (say 10.11.0 instead of 10.11.6). There are previous versions available for download, but they mostly are the most up to date version of 10.11.6, 10.10.5, 10.9.5 etc... and not an exhaustive list of each build.\nIf you really need it, contacting Apple Developer relations might work to get a specific build for a specific reason. This will likely cost money to be a paid developer and you might not succeed in convincing them you need an expired / patched build of the OS. Hopefully they would help as your other alternative is to find a copy on the internet which is liable to be one that's tampered with if you don't check carefully checksums of the download. People have seeded malicious \"Apple\" installers and shared them online, so the risk isn't academic to getting more than you requested with a third party download.\n", "Q: Can't disable 'Check spelling while typing' in 'Notes' in OSX El Capitan 10.11.6 This is driving me crazy.\nIn 'Notes', with a note text open/active, I uncheck 'Edit->Spelling and Grammar->Check spelling while typing'. Now the red underlines disappear from words believed to be spelled incorrectly, as expected. I close 'Notes', open it again. The same note text is active, but the red underlines are back. Checking the menu item above, I see that it is now checked again.\nHow come this setting won't stick when closing/opening 'Notes'? If I open/display another note text, then open/display the first note text, the red underlines are not back - it is only when 'Notes' is closed that this setting seems to be forgotten.\nI have tried this:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2577594 (changing some system-wide settings, however written for a different version of OSX)\n...but it doesn't help.\nPossibly a similar problem (not entirely clear) on OSX Yosemite, however no solution:\nHow to completely, utterly, disable spell-check on OS X Yosemite?\n\nA: Quit all applications.\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Text Tab. On the right side you should see \"Spelling : Automatic by Language\". In drop down list, choose \"Set Up...\" then uncheck English.\nNightmare free from those red underlines :D\nDrawback: doing so will disable Spelling checking in system wide, while you may want to disable in one specific app only.\n\nA: I am on El Capitan and wanted to turn off those red lines as well, but also keep the correction available with CommandShift;, so came up with a solution that seems to work:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Text.\n\n*Click on the \"Spelling\" selection drop-down menu and select \"Set Up\".\n\n*Disable English and all the other languages that you use, leave only those that you don't:\n\nThis works like a charm across all of OS X.\nIf you, at any time, want spellchecking, then press CommandShift; and select the language. It will work for the current app.\nHope it helps :)\n\nA: Solution: Upgrade OS X. In El Capitan, this is simply a bug and there seems to be no workaround. This is fixed in OS X Sierra.\n", "Q: preview pdf scrolling (also page up/down) Has anyone else encountered this (below) odd scrolling behaviour in Preview or found a better fix or workaround?\nI am using preview (version 9.0 909, 2016) from Sierra (mac OS 10.12) to view pdfs produced by pdflatex.  For preview to stay on current page when the file is rewritten, I have kept my previous settings:\nPreview→preferences→PDF→ [✓] Start on the last viewed page\nPreview→preferences→PDF→ Opening for the first time: Show as Single page\n\nWith the current version the scrolling behaviour has changed.  My document will not scroll in any of the standard ways.  None of these work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pageup/pagedown on keyboard\n\n*two-finger scroll on trackpad while pointer is over document\n\n*one-finger scroll on magic mouse while pointer is over document\n\n*Preview→Go→Up\n\n\nHowever the following do work:\n\n\n*\n\n*two-finger scroll on trackpad while pointer is over menu bar or tool bar\n\n*one-finger scroll on magic mouse while pointer is over menu bar or tool bar\n\n*any of the above if document magnification is decreased or increased slightly (it opens in \"⌘9 Zoom to fit\" mode)\n\n*switching to continuous scroll mode\n\n\nSpeculation: Preview is stuck halfway in its \"scrolling within page\" mode, as a vertical scrollbar appears, and either scrolls a small amount without the view changing, or doesn't move.  However, it can't scroll to the bottom and then progress to the next page like it normally would.\nPreview's continuous scroll mode is my current workaround.  This is tolerable, but I have Stockholm syndrome from previous versions of Preview, where a file change would reopen the document at page 1 in this mode, so Single page mode was my workaround for that.\n\nA: What seems to be happening is that when we used to set Preview in \"single page\" as the default, a newly-opened document window was exactly the right size, and you could easily up/down arrow through the pages.   \nHowever, now it instead opens the document with the page ever-so-slightly too large for the window from side to side, so Preview switches into \"Oh, you've zoomed in and you'd like to scroll around this ONE page\", and so the arrow keys become the scrolling around that ONE page keys.  \nExcept that since it's vertically the right size, up/down doesn't scroll.  Left/right arrows will, though.\nIf you slightly enlarge your window (or shrink the page) to include some space all around, you'll see the up and down keys work without the option/alt key.\nAnd this behavior is still screwed up as of 2017-05-29 (OS 10.12.5).\n\nA: I share your frustration with this! I don't remember it happening before, but now in Sierra, choosing Zoom To Fit, makes it zoom to not-quite-fit-but-a-little-too-big - so you can't use the Page Up/Down keys without manually resizing it. \nI used Keyboard Maestro, a macro program, to expand the window by just 5 pixels after doing Zoom to Fit, which is enough to make the Page Up/Down keys work properly, but this is a dumb error that they should fix.\n\nA: After having a similar problem I think the answer is that you have turned on \"Zoom\" in system preferences>Keyboard>Shortcuts. This Zooms the whole screen rather than just the document. If you turn that off, preview will use the option/command/+or- to zoom in on the document alone. This will allow the arrows to be used to scroll rather than change the page. \nMight be a little to late to help OP but in case anyone else is having this issue.\n", "Q: Strange behavior of `hdiutil` declare -i s=${foo}; n=${bar}; mp=${baz}; cn=${qux}; mac_adr=${quux} \nsudo hdiutil create -size ${s}b -fs JHFS+X -volname \"${n}\" -type SPARSEBUNDLE \\\n\"/Volumes/${mp}/${cn}_${mac_addr}.sparsebundle\" && echo \"Done\"\n\ndoes not work, but\ndeclare -i s=${foo}; n=${bar}; mp=${baz}; cn=${qux}; mac_adr=${quux} \nsudo hdiutil create -size ${s}b -fs JHFS+X -volname \"${n}\" -type SPARSEBUNDLE \\\n\"/Volumes/${cn}_${mac_addr}.sparsebundle\" &&\nsudo mv -vn \"/Volumes/${cn}_${mac_addr}.sparsebundle\" \"/Volumes/${mp}\" && echo \"Done\"\n\nWorks correctly\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I used the following command in 10.9.5:\nread -p \"Size in GB? = \" s; ((s= 10**9*s/512)); read -p \"Name of image volume? = \" n; read -p \"External Volume name (Escape spaces with a backslash - the volume has to exist)? = \" m; cn=`scutil --get ComputerName`; mac_addr=`ifconfig en0 | grep \"ether\"`; mac_addr=${mac_addr#*ether}; mac_addr=${mac_addr// /} ; mac_addr=${mac_addr//:/}; sudo hdiutil create -size ${s}b -fs JHFS+X -volname \"${n}\" -type SPARSEBUNDLE \"/Volumes/${m}/${cn}_${mac_addr}.sparsebundle\" && echo \"Done\"\n\nand it works (with a workaround for spaces in volume names like \"Macintosh HD\") for internal volumes:\nSize in GB? = 2\nName of image volume? = aaa\nExisting External Volume Name (Escape spaces with a backslash)? = test\\ 2\ncreated: /Volumes/test 2/host_001122334455.sparsebundle\nDone\nhost:~ user$ \n\nThis doesn't work if you create a sparsebundle on a network share.

I have a Late 2015 iMac which has a 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 8 GB of memory.\nI also have a Mid 2012 MacBook Air which has a 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 4 GB of memory.\nThe iMac uses a Apple HDD in contrast to the MacBook Air's Apple SSD.\nHowever, it seems like the iMac is running much slower than MacBook Air from the day it was bought. It would occasionally show the spinning wheel, when opening files and it would take an average of 20 seconds to open applications.\nQ1: Is the HDD/SSD the main cause of this? Since all the other configurations are better than MacBook Air.\nQ2: Would its speed improve if I switch the HDD to a SSD?\n\nA: From what you've written it does not sound like the iMac's sluggishness is caused by the hard drive and I'd wait before swapping it out with a SSD (unless you were going to do that anyway). \nIt's true that a SSD can read/write faster than a traditional HDD and this should make a machine with the former installed more responsive and feel \"zippier\" than a comparably spec'd machine equipped with the latter. \nHowever, given that your iMac has double the RAM, a better GPU and a 7200RPM HDD  it should be fast and responsive and generally outperform the Air. It should definitely not be taking 20 seconds to launch an application or frequently stalling. \nThe \"spinning beachball\" suggests there could be background processes at work on your iMac that are hogging CPU cycles, causing the OS and other applications to struggle. \nTo check if this is the case Activity Monitor (located by default in\n/Applications/Utilities) gives you an overview of the processes that are currently running and how much of the CPU's power they are tying up. This can help pinpoint which applications are using more than their fair share of processing power. \nBut if your iMac has been sluggish since you bought it, it might easier to back up your data, wipe the drive and do a clean install of the operating system. This could be quicker and less of a hassle than a lengthy troubleshooting process. \n\nA: The examples you've used in your question can be explained by the use of the SSD in the MacBook Air.\nIn March 2014 I installed a hybrid drive (what Apple calls a 'Fusion' drive) into a late 2008 MacBook Pro. The results of doing this compared to the standard HDD that was installed previously were significant!\nNow, remember this was just a hybrid drive NOT an SSD. My tests showed that:\n\n\n*\n\n*bootup time was 16 seconds faster\n\n*login time was 6 seconds faster\n\n*launching MS Word was 17 seconds faster \n\n\nI then tested this against a mid-2011 iMac with a traditional 7200rpm drive and the MacBook Pro was faster! Remember again this was just a hybrid drive NOT an SSD in the MacBook Pro.\nOne thing you should notice on the iMac though is that the first time you launch an application after booting up it will take longer than subsequent launches (unless you've rebooted again).\nSo yes, the SSD will explain the difference in the examples you gave, but there will be other tasks that your iMac will perform faster because they rely more on processing power rather than disk read/write times.\nWhether you should install an SSD is a matter for you. It'll improve speed generally, but how much will depend on what you use your iMac for.\n[EDIT]\nI found the full results of my testing for the hybrid drive in my late 2008 MacBook Pro. See the table below:\n\nAs you can see, the response times also improved by doing a reformat and clean install on the original HDD. However, since you've got a late 2015 iMac I don't imagine you've had enough time to weigh the system down with unnecessary software etc. \nThe point I guess I'm trying to make is that the answer to your question Is the HDD/SSD the main cause of this? is yes for the examples you gave, but if you have other real life examples that would be good for some context. \n\nA: To answer your questions directly:\nQ1: Yes (probably)\nQ2: Yes (probably)\nThat is the most likely scenario, but you should check other things as well: start by downloading a program such as black magic design's disk speed tested and check the disk speed on each computer. Likely, you will find that the MacBook Air is significantly slower than the iMac. If this is the case, you will likely be able to speed the computer up by swapping the HDD for an SSD. That being said, on a 2015 iMac, actually doing the replacement may be difficult. If the speed difference isn't that great (less than 2x), look for a different problem.\nPlease note that I have answered this question to the best of my ability. If I have gotten something wrong, please let me know.\n\nA: That iMac shipped with a 5400 drive.  Yes, I think it's safe to say that's your cause of slowness (assuming you have already run hardware diagnostics etc.)  SSDs are significantly faster than rotating drives.\nUnfortunately the replacement procedure in those iMacs isn't quite so easy - the screens are glued down, and you have to remove that in order to access the internals.  Unless you have some experience, and specialized tools, for taking these apart, I'd recommend you take it to a good shop to replace the stock drive with an SSD. \nOn the bright side, SSDs are relatively cheap, and b/c it's not such an easy undertaking, I would recommend installing something roomy (at least 512 GB) for future proofing.\n", "Q: Bash Script which calls osascript stops working when run by launchd I am trying to troubleshoot a problem with a bash script that gets called  by launchd.

If you only have one USB inserted, it should be /dev/sdb.\n\n*Select the partition with the label \"Peristence\".\n\n*Click partition at the top.\n\n*After this (choose unmount if the option is available) choose format to and then choose ext3.\n\n*Click edit at the top.\n\n*Choose Apply All Operations.\n\n*Apply.\n\n*Select the newly formatted partition.\n\n*Click partition at the top.\n\n*Click label.\n\n*Label \"Persistence\".\n\n*Choose Apply All Operations.\n\n*Apply.\n\n\nPart 5: Reboot\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your machine (as in step 3).\n\n*Change your desktop background to a solid colour (grey for example).\n\n*Restart you machine again.\n\n*If your desktop background is the colour you changed it to, you now have persistent storage.\n\n\nHopefully this helps anyone having issues.\n", "Q: Bizarre Wi-Fi connectivity issues The problem started a couple of weeks ago. I noticed that when I had Google Drive actively syncing the Finder would frequently \"refresh\"; if I paused the syncing, this stopped. Moreover, if I left it syncing/refreshing for too long, the Wi-Fi would stop working, or the computer wouldn't wake from sleep. I was running Lion for I thought these issues might go away if I just upgraded to Sierra.\nI uninstalled Google Drive; made Safari, not Chrome my default browser; and proceeded to make a Time Machine backup before the upgrade. While the Finder \"refresh\" issue has stopped, the connectivity issues have only gotten worse.\nBasically, any time my Desktop tries to send/receive a large amount of data, it quickly slows the Wi-Fi to a trickle, and eventually makes it stop altogether. This includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transferring files via \"File Sharing\" from my Desktop to my Laptop.\n\n*Downloading the Sierra update from the App Store.\n\n*Trying to re-sync my 900GB of Google Drive files.\n\n\nLet me explain the symptoms. At first the Wi-Fi is working fine, and I can see all the signals around me:\n\nThen after a while the transfer will become incredibly slow, and suddenly the list of networks around me becomes almost empty:\n\nWhat is most strange is that some webpages will continue to load, and Dropbox will still sync. If I use terminal to ping (say google.com) it is around this time that I start to lose data packets, usually around a 2% loss rate. When this has happened for an extended period of time, or if I turn the Wi-Fi connection off and then on again, the list of signals becomes completely empty:\n\nNothing I do will reestablish the connection. Nothing will load, and I cannot access the internet until I have rebooted the entire computer:\n\nI managed to hobble along and get everything backed up, and even got Sierra installed. However the issue has still been plaguing my Google Drive. I even re-installed it, and made sure Chrome was updated. I'm not sure if this is an OS X or Chrome/Google issue, as it seems to have a lot of symptoms in common with other peoples' issues for both situations.\nI really need to access my Google Drive. Please, any help you can offer is very appreciated.\n\nA: Not much of an \"answer\", but I eventually tried connecting the machine directly to the modem via an ethernet cable, and turned the wireless off altogether.\nThis solved my connectivity issues immediately. Since I tried troubleshooting everything I could find online, I am left assuming it must have been a failing wireless card. Unfortunately the Hardware Test diagnostics do not run on my computer (this machine has lots of problems...) so I can't tell for sure without simply getting a new card installed.\nIf anyone else is ever experiencing the same symptoms I was, maybe this is also your problem.\n", "Q: How to modify Hardware UUID of a macOS Sierra Virtual machine in VMware fusion/parallel desktop I've got to have different Hardware UUID for software testing purposes.\nWhen cloning a VM in Fusion pro 8.5, the clone gets a new MAC address but the hardware  UUID in system report in macOS doesn't change.\nAny idea how I can assign a new UUID to virtual Mac guest OS?\n\nA: The text file that Fusion uses to assign this is editable when the VM is powered off (don't suspend, shut down the OS):\n\n*\n\n*Turn off VM\n\n*In machine folder, change uuid.bios section in <>.vmx file (f e.g. uuid.bios = \"aa aa ...\").\n\n*In machine folder delete .nvram file\n\n*Boot VM\n\nIn \"About this MAC\" you must see\n\n", "Q: Does the password on OSX user account prevent someone from viewing your /user folder if they have the HD in an external enclosure? Ive got a strong password on my user account on my macbook pro running OSX, which will prevent someone from booting up my laptop and logging in and viewing my files, but will this stop someone from being able to remove the HD from my laptop put it in a external hard drive enclosure and view all of my files using finder on another machine ? \nOr are all the files stored in my user account encrypted using my user account login password ? If not how can i prevent someone from accessing these files if they get there hands on my laptop and remove the HD ?\nIm running OSX 10.10\n\nA: Unless you have turned FileVault on which encrypts your drive your files can be read by anyone who has physical access to your machine. They don't need to take the disk out and put it into an external enclosure, they can boot into single user mode which can read every thing or boot into the recovery partition and either reinstall the OS without deleting data or I think add admin users or boot of a Linux USB drive.\nIf you need to protect your data you must encrypt it and the Apple way is top use FileVault and then you need a password to read the drive.\n\nA: No the account password does not protect your data if someone starts your computer up in Target Disk Mode or if they physically remove the drive and access it from another computer.\nHowever, you can use FileVault.\nBy starting up FileVault in the Security system preferences, the entire disk will be encrypted and will not be accessible via Target Disk Mode (or even when physically removed from the system) unless you first attach it to a system that supports CoreStorage and then provide a password to unlock the disk.\n\nA: What you can do is set an EFI, or firmware, password. This will protect against single user mode but will also disable the rest of the startup commands from what I have heard. I don't use them enough and haven't really tried any startup commands on my EFI password protected Mac so I can't say for certain but seems logical enough that I have no reason to question it.\nHowever, this does not protect against someone pulling out the drive and booting externally.  As the previous comments and answers have mentioned FileVault will likely be the number one solution for your specific question. \n", "Q: Accessibility settings asking everytime Those two apps are always asking for the accessibility permission, one is location and the other is contacts.

I use Little Snitch (https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) to monitor background network traffic. When an application tries to connect to the internet for the first time, Little Snitch pops up a dialog box that asks me whether I want to allow the connection. Most of the time it's pretty obvious what the process is, and I either Allow or Deny network access. But I'm stumped by this process:\n\nWhat is AppArt? What is application-stats.com?

With enough adapters, simply connecting the computer to the necessary monitors, mice, and keyboards should be possible; however, the interesting part is how to allow to share the computer's performance and sending independent data to the two monitors.\n\nA: no, in fact you cannot SIMULTANEOUSLY use a system with two separate users logged in simultaneously on two different monitors.\nseveral other options may allow something similar:\n1 user logged in on the display.\n2nd user logged in via SSH to terminal as any available user.. \nHowever this won't allow the computer to drive 2 displays - the 2nd user would be able to do terminal commands only, and could in fact overide any actions done by the first user (depending on permissions, user account, etc)...\n\nA: There is precedent for this type of thing in the client/server world, with multiple users logging into a server from their own clients.\nThe problem is that there is no adapter (that I am aware of) to allow a second physically connected set of hardware to use a different user account than the one in use by the first set of hardware. Without such an adapter, you're just going to be fighting over the same mouse cursor and keyboard inputs.\nWith another device available, you may be able to use that device to remotely connect to the MacBook Pro with a different user account and have them operating simultaneously.\n\nA: Unfortunately it is not possible to have 2 separate users on the same machine both using their own mouse/keyboard/monitor.\n", "Q: How can I prevent sleep in OSX Recovery mode? I'm doing a disk backup in OSX Recovery Mode and it sleeps.  In sleep mode, the backup stops dead.  Hot corners do nothing.  Sleep seems to kick in after 30 seconds - unsupportable for backing up 850 GB over USB 2.0 (sigh).\nI found articles about OSX's \"caffeinate\" command, but it's too late - I'm 1/3 through the backup.\nCan't I keep my Mac running while it's doing this actual intended important work in Recovery Mode?\n\nA: If you're already in Recovery Mode doing some operation you don't want to interrupt, you can try this trick to run caffeinate.\nGo to the Wi-Fi icon on the menu bar and pull it down.  Select \"Join Other Network...\"\nThe \"Find and join a Wi-Fi network\" dialog will be there, but look at the application title.  It's \"macOS Utilities.\" Go to the Utilities menu and select \"Terminal\".\nIn the terminal, issue the command caffeinate.  When your operation is done, control-C out of it.\nIf it bothers you that the display sleeps and you don't really trust that the operation is still going, you can issue a stronger version:\ncaffeinate -dismut 65500\nThis is sort of like 'sleeplessness with prejudice.'  With the -u flag you get an implicit -t 5, which stops caffeine after five seconds.  So I overrode this by adding '-t 65500' which makes the caffeinate command last about 18 hours.\nFinally, because I'm really, REALLY paranoid, I actually put caffeinate in the background and run a shell loop with ps -ef running every 75 seconds.\n", "Q: Easiest way to build a one-off iPhone \"App\" (probably JS on a local web page)? At work, we have a certain esoteric calculation that needs to be made from time to time. There is a simple two-line bash script available that does it, but this requires a computer and I often need to do this calculation on the workshop floor or in the field where a laptop might not be immediately to hand. It would be very convenient to have something like an iPhone app instead. It must be usable without an Internet connection as I sometimes work in places with no wifi or phone signal.\nOf course I could learn Objective C, set up XCode, get whatever Apple dev account I need for this, and so on - but this seems like a disproportionate amount of work to replace two lines of bash script on one phone for my own use. \nSo, question, what is the simplest way to make something that looks roughly like an app on my home screen? If it weren't for the offline requirement then a Safari bookmark to an HTML/Javascript page on the Web somewhere would be ideal - is there any equivalent to a file:// URL on iOS?\n\nA: I asked this as a genuine question, but I'm now answering it myself since I found a technique that works for me and it might help others.\nI wrote a basic old-school HTML + Javascript page that did the required calculation, then uploaded it to my web server along with the manifest file described here.

A little later in the day I discovered that music wasn't playing. (Oddly, I was still getting sound effects from a game.) The music app would advance the progress bar on a song but produce no sound.\nWith that additional data, I rebooted the phone (full power down and power back up) and music would play and so would the voicemail.

I recently added an external SSD to my 2012 Mac mini, connected with a USB 3.0 cable.\nI also have a 500 GB HDD and everything works fine.\nI am just wondering if it's recommend to move the home folder to the HDD to reduce the writing to the SSD.\nOne more thing, since the addition of the SSD, I'm avoiding entering sleep mode (again, to prevent pointless writing to the SSD) and I'm turning the computer off instead.\nIs there a solution for this?\n\nA: To disable hibernation go to terminal and type \nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nIf you'd like to reenable later down the line use:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\n\nAs far as moving the home folder, I feel is a bit silly given the price of ssds. If you do want to do it that's fine, but I don't think most people would suggest doing so. Especially given that it's an external drive connected with a cable I would suggest leaving everything on one drive. Less chance of things going wrong, just make sure you have back ups.\n\nA: If you're concerned about \"pointless writing to the SSD\" because you feel that it would wear out the drive faster, let me just say that you should put that notion to rest. SSDs have advanced tremendously since they started to become popular several years ago and the concern about cells getting worn out is really no longer applicable in a home setting.\nI don't recall where I've most recently seen statistics, but for a (say) 240GB SSD to get worn out, you would need to be continuously writing to it non-stop for a few years before some cells start to fail due to wear. Even in the home power user scenario, you're not going to be doing that by a long shot. If it does? You'll start to notice as the OS will probably begin complaining (but not fail). By that time, a 1TB SSD will be available probably for less than you bought your 240GB for.\nUse your SSD and don't worry about the writes.\nNow as far as putting your HOME directory on it, I don't know if I would necessarily do that simply because external USB drives have a tendency to be disconnected and unmounted and you don't want to risk corruption of your data; not thinking files getting unrecoverable corrupt, but more like iPhoto needing to rebuild its database corrupt because it didn't finish writing its consistency. But installing (say) your Steam applications to it?

I tried to partition my Macintosh HD ( internal 1TB SSD) disk (by splitting into half). It seemed to have split but has given me some errors about mapping or mounting...So I restarted the computer. After which, I was unable to bootup again - facing the 'stop'/'block' sign every time.\nI got into Recovery Mode (cmd + R while restarting) and tried using the repair disk option. After clicking repair it keeps telling me the disk needs to be repaired. I click repair again but the same message prompting to repair again pops up. By the way, it's showing my disk as a Virtual Whole disk (500.2GB partition + 499.8GB partition). NB. I managed to erase one of the partitions (I think the 499GB one) within the Virtual Whole Disk. However, the other one cannot be erased (the option is greyed-out)\nI would like to repair my disk as opposed to starting over with a brand new install. I have a pre-partition Time Machine backup on a USB drive. I tried to restore it via the recovery mode. However, it was unable to find a destination (disk) to restore it to. I am assuming the destination disk needs to be 1TB since that was the disk's size (single paritioned), although I had only used ~70GB capacity; ie the backup size on my USB drive is also 70GB.\nI tried Internet Recovery Mode, as I read that I can't repair my disk via the normal recovery mode...but still to no avail. Should I perhaps bootup a Mac OS via an external USB and and try disk the utlility from there? If yes, how can I download a bootable yosemite OS onto a USB drive?

At least your CoreStorage Logical Volume Group got corrupted either by partitioning or by \"repairing\".\nThe ultimate method to reset the drive is to completely destroy the GUID partition table of the main internal disk. This will render all data on the disk useless and you need an up-to-date backup to restore your old volume.\nTo destroy the GUID of your internal physical disk you have to boot to an external boot volume. This may be a OS X installer thumb drive or Internet Recovery Mode (which net-boots to a recovery image provided by Apple over the network). You mustn't boot to Recovery Mode which loads a basic system in a mounted but compressed recovery image in your recovery partition diskXs3).\n\n\n*\n\n*Detach any external disks - especially your Time Machine backup drive\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery Mode\n\n*Open Terminal in the menubar Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*Get an overview (especially the gpt command is important!):\ndiskutil list\ngpt -r show disk0\ngpt -r show disk1\n\nCheck which of both disks is your internal disk. Usually the internal disk is disk0 and the recovery volume is disk1 if you have only one disk in your Mac. In rare cases disk1 is your internal disk and disk0 is the recovery volume. The recovery disk has ~ 2600000 blocks (or ~1.3 GB). Even the smallest SSD is much larger. Below I assume your internal disk has the disk identifier disk0 - so use disk1 (or disk2, disk3) instead of disk0 in the commands if you find an other disk identifier for your internal physical disk.\n\n*Unmount disk0:\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Delete the GUID:\ngpt destroy disk0\n\nIf this doesn't help, then the hard way:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=512 count=40\n\n\n*Create a new  GUID partition (this also creates a fresh pMBR):\ngpt create -f disk0\n\n\n*Enter exit and quit Terminal.\n\n*Open Disk Utility and partition your internal disk: one or two partitions and at least one JHFS+ volume.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility\n\n*Attach your Time Machine backup drive, open Restore Time Machine backup (or similar) from OS X Utilties and restore your backup.\n\n\n\nThis usually won't restore your Recovery HD. You have to do this either manually with Recovery Partition 4.0.4 or by reinstalling your current system with an Apple system installer (i.e. \"Install OS X Yosemite\" 10.10.5, which usually won't affect your data)\n", "Q: bzip2 compression library not found error I get bzip2 compression library… no error when trying to install some software on a mac running osx 10.12. Some googling revealed that the headers for bzip2 should be there for the installer to recognize bzip2 and this could be achieved by installing the dev package. However, couldn't find one for osx. For example for Fedora this is bzip2-devel.\n\nA: By default header files aren't installed to /usr/include.\nIf you run xcode-select install in a Terminal window this will install the Xcode command line tools and also populate the /usr/include folder with a bunch of header files including bzlib.h.\nThis might be what you're looking for.\n", "Q: ruby version on macOS Sierra Can someone let me know the version of ruby on macOS sierra?

I'm having quite a few difficulties with my old, late 2010 iMac, and upgrading from Lion to Siearra did not help. I have used my Laptop to create a USB Boot for El Capitan, and I would like to use it to downgrade my Desktop to El Capitan.\nI know these older models of iMac cannot install Windows, via Bootcamp, from a USB, but is this the same for OSX? Any help with downgrading/fresh installing to El Capitan would be much appreciated.\nP.S. My iMac's super drive is broken, so I cannot install anything from a disc. It's USB or nothing, I'm afraid.\n\nA: Your iMac late 2010 is compatible with Sierra according to the official MacOS Sierra - Technical Specifications page.\n\nMac Hardware Requirements\nFor details about your Mac model, click the Apple icon at the top left\n  of your screen, choose About This Mac, then choose More Info.

It's up to you what OS installation to proceed with, but as long as your hardware supports the newest OS version I would go with clean install of Sierra.\nBefore proceeding further make sure you have your data backup somewhere, preferably using Time Machine. Also make sure you have a working memory stick with 8GB or more on it.\nYou can create a bootable USB drive with macOS Sierra on it following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to App Store and Download macOS Sierra. You can do that even you already have the macOS installed.\n\n\n*When the download will be finished the popup will appear asking you to proceed with installation. You need to close it. You can double check the location of your Install macOS Sierra.app in Applications folder.\n\n\n*With your memory sticked inserted in your you need to open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) window. And copy/paste the following command:\n\n\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\nFor El Capitan you'll have to type this command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\nWhere Untitled is the name of your memory stick.\n\n\n\n*Then you need to type Y acknowledging the fact that your memory stick will be erased in order to create bootable media.\n\n\n*Copying installer files to disk process can take some time depending on type of your memory stick (2.0 or 3.0) and your internal HD (HDD or SSD).\n\n*When the process is finished you will see the following screen:\n\n\n*You can proceed with restarting your iMac keeping the memory stick inserted.\n\n*You need to hold ⌥ key during the startup in order to go into Startup Manager. \n\n\n*You need to choose Install macOS Sierra from the available options.\n\n*Go to Disk utility and erase (OS X Extended (Journaled)) the current startup drive - the one you're running your OS on. This will format your drive and delete everything on it.\n\n*When the formatting process is finished, close Disk Utility and select Install macOS from the menu. Make sure you're installing your macOS on the startup drive not your memory stick.\n\n\nFollowing these steps will help you with your macOS clean install. If you feel you get stuck somewhere you can always consult with this guide or this one. There are many other guides available.\n", "Q: How do I turn off \"Show Bluetooth in menu bar\"? On macOS Sierra, if I go to System Preferences > Bluetooth, and uncheck \"Show Bluetooth in menu bar\", the symbol remains stubbornly visible.\nHow can I make it invisible?\n\nA: Try holding down the Command key and using the mouse to drag the Bluetooth symbol off the menu bar. Alternately there is a check mark to uncheck in the bluetooth preferences in System Preferences.\n\nA: You may also try to relaunch the Finder. Hold 'Alt/Option' key and right-click Finder icon in the Dock. Then select Relaunch command.\n\nA: Usually, rebooting the system fixes it.\n", "Q: command + tab not switching focus Normally, when I have apps on two separate monitors, I can switch focus to an open app (on either screen) using Command+tab. I can then switch spaces on that specific screen using Control-arrow keys. However, I am unable to do that: Despite the fact that the screen will focus on a specific monitor, I can only switch spaces on the screen where my mouse resides.\n\nA: Switching spaces using the keyboard shortcuts is dependent on your focus, rather than the app that's in the foreground. macOS determines your focus by looking at your mouse's position.\nIf it used the foreground app to determine your focus, and you had a space with no apps open in it, you would never be able to use a keyboard shortcut to change the space on that monitor.\n", "Q: Two external monitors + one own on mid-2015 13-inch entry level MacBook Pro?

Basically making it three monitor setup - two external and one built-in.\nP.S. I do not consider adding any external portable USB graphic cards, as I've tried one with good reviews and it sucked.\n\nA: Yes, you can.

I've had my Time Machine backup volume (sparsebundle) for a couple of years now and it's become quite large.\nSince it is very easy to delete old backups of certain directories in the GUI I was wondering if it is safe to just delete all backups of for example /System/ and a lot of subfolders of /Library/ because those files get replaced on every OSX upgrade and I won't ever go back to an old operating system anyway. Is that safe to do? There is nothing on the internet about that.\nOr is /System/ usually excluded anyway? That would kind of make sense, right?\nAny thoughts on that? Thank you!\n\nA: You can certainly do this. I would first set Time Machine to exclude the system folder and then get a back up or two intervals.\nThen you can browse the current backup and step back in time. Once you see a folder show up - control click (right click) and delete all versions of the affected folders.\nIn practice, system changes are very low and small - so you might only save 20 GB or so. Applications might save a little more space, but you can do what you want.\nI generally just set my drive on the shelf and get another $100 drive and start over. Much easier than squeezing the last few GB from a full drive - but if you back up to a network volume - cloning that to an external drive takes quite some time in practice. That's also a nice option if you can spend the time and then start over. Be sure to test restoring a file before you delete anything you might care to not lose.\n", "Q: Problems apps synching with iCloud and memory running out I have an iPhone 6 and an iPad 4 mini linked to the same iCloud account, and have set synch settings in the usual way to backup photos and apps to the iCloud. I have storage plan of 50 GB, and currently using 37 GB from that. The app I use most the time on iPhone is Whatsapp.\nThe problem seems to be that iPhone local storage is running out, and I keep receiving warnings, even though the iCloud has plenty of space. I am not sure what to do to fix this. I checked all settings and tried to research it online, but still no answers. I suspected that the Whatsapp might be keeping the data locally (e.g. photos/videos), even though the iCloud has backed them up, but I am not sure. \nHere are screen shots of the situation. \n\n\nA: The problem is the local storage on the phone. The middle picture showing device backups isn't a problem - you have plenty of space in the cloud.\nIf you can't figure out how to prune what's app - you can try their support and/or deleting the app and letting the storage stabilize over a day.\nOnce you know how much free space of the 16 GB is available without over half being taken by WhatsApp - you can then document that and re-download that one app.\n\nThings won't work well until you free up a GB of space and it looks like WhatsApp is the only possible solution to your current jam.\n\nA: WhatsApp is the culprit in this situation.\nMost of your WhatsApp data is not being stored in iCloud, as shown in your second screenshot, where WhatsApp is using 40.8 MB of data in iCloud versus 6.3 GB on your device.\nWhatsApp does not delete data even when it's backed up to iCloud. Conversely, deleting chats from WhatsApp will remove them from the backup in iCloud. Backups of WhatsApp are only intended to save what's currently present in the app.\nYou can determine what chats are taking up the most space by opening WhatsApp, going to the Settings tab, tapping on Account, tapping on Storage Usage, and switching to the Size tab at the bottom. This will sort chats by size, largest at the top. Tapping on a chat will result in a list of usage by category - see screenshot below for an example. (Note I removed phone numbers/contact names and images.)\nYou can export chats, optionally including media, by opening a chat as normal, tapping on the contact name or group name at the top, then tapping Export Chat. It may take some time for it to create the chat archive. Once it does, a share sheet will appear and you can choose whether to email it, message it, or use other apps installed that can interact with .zip files (such as Dropbox).\nOnce you have exported it and saved it somewhere, it's then safe to delete the chat itself in WhatsApp. This will cause the chat and any attached media to be removed and you should see a reduction in the storage usage in the Settings app.\n\n", "Q: Does OS X scale the resolution of my screen? I'm using an Early 2015 13\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display and it has a native screen resolution of 2560 by1600 pixels, the default setting says \"looks like 1280x800\", and it seems like every program thinks this is my resolution I've set it to the \"More space\" option, which says \"looks like 1650x1050\", for now.\nThis is still a problem for me, everything looks far too big for what I need. Is there any way to make the 2560x1600 display to look like \"real 2560x1600\"? Or is this just a thing OS X does?\nPS: I've tried this in OS X El Capitan and macOS Sierra.\n\nA: You can use an app like Display Menu, available for free in the App Store, to set the Display to its highest resolution, as well as other available resolutions.\nNote that there is a paid Pro version too, for $1.99 USD, which offers AppleScript Support, Retina Resolutions which displays all resolutions with a mouse click and Bookmarks for Quick Access.\nI've used the regular version for over 3 years now on my 15\" Mid 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina Display and it's done all I've needed without upgrading to the Pro version.

This is part of a larger process called signing.\nApple only sign updates for a certain time frame for each iOS revision. Typically, when a new update rolls out, the second most recent firmware is still signed for a couple of weeks before it is no longer signed in place for the new firmware.\niOS 8.4.1 is years out of this window, and iOS 9.3.2 is also no longer being signed also.\nThis is Apple's way to assure that devices are running the latest version of iOS to promote features to users but more importantly security fixes for vulnerabilities and exploits.\n", "Q: Listing in Terminal the last mounted volume Attach(1)ing different copies of the same dmg file create in /Volumes folders representing each image.

I have been having minor issues for a couple months, so I figured I would backup and  reinstall the OS to see if that would help. \nAfter backing up, I booted into recovery mode to erase and reformat the hard drive. After which, I attempted to reinstall os X through the internet. After two attempts (each of which didn't succeed, it seemed to download just fine, but never installed. I saw no errors, the computer was off wen I came back to it) The computer started to show the file with a question mark on bootup.\nFrom this point on, nothing has worked on the computer. Recovery mode wont start. Internet recovery mode wont start. Both simply show the aforementioned file and question mark. If I try to select a boot drive, it doesn't show the file, but it only displays the mouse on the whitish/grayish startup background.  The mouse moves, but I cant't actually do anything; there is nothing to click on.\nI have reset the SMC, and the NVRAM. I have also tried reformatting the hard drive, again (Using a windows desktop, formatted to exFAT, but it changed nothing) While I had it in the windows desktop, I also used Seatools (the hard drive is a 1TB seagate SSD/HDD combo) to run diagnostics on the drive, but it showed no problems, from a 'Long Generic' or a 'Short Drive Self Test'. \nWhat else can I try to fix this? I have an osx 10.11.5 disk image on a thumb drive, but I haven't even been able to see that hardware has been connected, much less choose a boot drive.\nI have access to ethernet, another macbook (about 2013-ish), a usb connector for my hard drive, a windows desktop running windows 7 ultimate, and whatever other resources a university might offer to their students in terms of tech support (However, being an electrical engineering student, I can't say I've ever been impressed by their ability to help)\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro cannot find a system to boot from, hence the question mark. \nIn addition, your troubleshooting was partly in error because you shouldn't have formatted the drive in exFAT format if you intend to install OS X on it.\nSince you have access to another MacBook and since it appears your USB thumb drive with OS X 10.11.5 on it isn't a bootable disk, I suggest you startup your MacBook Pro in Target Disk Mode and install OS X using the other MacBook. This approach assumes the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*the other MacBook has a Firewire port\n\n*you have access to a suitable Firewire cable\n\n\nIf not I'm hoping you can get access to either or both of these from your University's tech support.\nAssuming you can proceed, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reconnect the hard drive inside the MacBook Pro. \n\n*Connect the two MacBooks via Firewire cable.\n\n*Startup your MacBook Pro while pressing the T key down until you see an icon floating around the screen.\n\n*Startup the other MacBook normally.\n\n*The MacBook Pro's hard drive will appear just like an external disk to the other Macbook.\n\n*Run Disk Utility to erase the MacBook Pro's hard drive so that it's formatted in Mac OS Extended format.\n\n*Now run the the OS X Installer from the other MacBook to install OS X on the MacBook Pro\n\n\nNOTE: \nIf you haven't actually got an installer, you can use the Mac App Store to redownload it. In doing so you'll have to log into your Apple ID account (under the Store menu) on the Mac App Store and go to the Purchased window to find the installer you want to download again. This assumes you have previously used your account to downloaded the installer at some point.\nHope this helps. Let us know how you go.\n", "Q: I have several hundred expired certificates starting with com.apple.idms.appleid.prd. What are they and are they safe to delete? I recently looked at Keychain Access and found that I have 394 certificates prefixed with com.apple.idms.appleid.prd, all of which are expired.\n\nWhen I get more info on one of them, I see that it is from the Apple Certification Authority.\n\nWhat are these certificates? Why do I have so many of them?\nI tried to delete them and got this scary warning:\n\nUnfortunately, I am not certain that I no longer need the selected key. So I'd like to ask: will I be needing the hundreds of expired keys, and is it safe to delete them?\n\nA: Expired certificates can be safely deleted.\nThey were likely generated as a result of a problem authenticating with iCloud.\n", "Q: Can I add folder keyboard shortcuts? (like there are for Home, Downloads, etc) Finder's Go menu shows a bunch of keyboard shortcuts for many standard folders:\n\nSo within Finder, but also within the Open or Save File dialogs of other applications, I can use ⇧+⌘+O to go to my Documents folder, or ⇧+⌥+L for my Downloads folder, et cetera.\nI happily use this hundreds of times a day.\nCan I add my own keyboard shortcuts here? For example, as a Developer, I often find myself going to my ~/Code folder by pressing ⇧+⌘+H for Home, then navigating to Code. But I'd rather press something like ⇧+⌥+C to go there directly.\nIs this possible, and if yes, how?\n\nA: It is indeed possible. To look at how, please read this answer – it's better than I could have explained.\nSpecifically, you would want to try what's written under the steps:\n\nTo open a new window every time, add a Get Specified Finder Items action, drop the folder you want to open on the list, and then add a Reveal Finder Items action.\n\nSo in Automator you would add your folder as described above, and then carry out step 4, assigning whichever shortcut you wanted for it.\n", "Q: Cant sign into any Google iOS app Cannot sign into any Google iOS app (Google, Google Maps, Google Earth) on my new iPhone 7 Plus.\nIt says:\n\"Sorry there seems to be a problem please try again\"\nHave tried:\n-Resetting iPhone\n-Signing into the accounts on my iPhone 6 (Works fine)\n-Signing in to a different account on iphone 7 (Doesnt work)\n-Uninstalling and reinstalling the apps\n-Enabling 2 factor authentication\nBut still no fix\nLogging into the account on the computer works fine as well.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Download the Google Chrome app on the iPhone and sign in to your Google account in the Chrome app.  Then open the Gmail app (or any other Google app) and you should have an option to slide a switch and be logged in to your account in the Gmail app as well.  if you don't get that option try deleting and re downloading the Gmail app.\nProblem seems to be between Safari and the Google login, in my case with two-factor enabled.\n", "Q: Language mismatch in Apple menu bar The default language on my iMac is Italian, however, after restoring from a time machine backup, the language of the shutdown and reboot options from the menu bar have mixed language.\n\nThe \"countdown\" is in Italian but the other text is not, as you can see.

I have some MP3s on my Mac. I want to import them into my iPhone. The problem is that, using iTunes, the iPhone automatically create several folders or albums, depending on the artist, the album, the genre (and so on) of one particular MP3 file.\nUsing Windows it's easy to prevent this, since I can delete manually all of these tags and file information, but using the Mac I seem to not be able to do this. Is there any way to delete this information?\n\nA: I'm answering this because it's the first result in Google and this is a more complete answer to the question title than exists in other Q&As I see.\nTo reliably remove \"Comment\" data, macOS file metadata \"Where from\" URLs, and all regular audio metadata for an audio file like mp3/m4a/m4b including embedded artwork:\nFirst check existing metadata:\n\n*\n\n*In macOS Finder you may see artwork in the thumbnail of the file, or via Cmd-I (File > Get Info).\n\n\n*To potentially see more complete data that the GUI doesn't show:\n\n*\n\n*First install homebrew then do brew install exiftool\n\n*Now in Terminal do both mdls file.mp3 and exiftool file.mp3\nRemove everything:\nHere is a Terminal method.\nFor all file types:\n\n*\n\n*To remove macOS \"Where from\" metadata, do xattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms file.ogg\nMP3 files:\n\n*\n\n*First install homebrew then do  brew install id3lib.\n\n\n*To obliterate all mp3 tags and embedded artwork, do id3convert -s file.mp3\nM4A / M4B files:\n\n*\n\n*First install homebrew then do brew install exiftool\n\n*Do exiftool -all:all= file.m4b\nCheck metadata again to make sure you have a clean file!\n\nA: Within iTunes, you can select the file and press command-I to get the file information.

This question was asked three times, as far as I know, but none of these has an answer that I'm looking for:\n1 – This unfortunately doesn't seem like a method to preserve specific backups\n2 – This was marked as a duplicate of the above but I feel like it better suits the question. However, there aren't any answers for it\n3 – This probably is my question best stated but there are no answers\nSo my question is, is it possible at all to prevent specific backups from being deleted from my Time Machine drive? Would it be possible to copy and paste specific backup to another location to preserve it and then restore from them later on? (I don't particularly think that it would copy a bootable backup, though)\n\nA: Based on how Time Machine consolidates it backups, unless there is an unpublished method to modify how Time Machine is coded to do this (and I don't think there is), I'd say no, you cannot prevent specific backups from getting deleted.\nThat said, why are you trying to preserve specific backups, to what end and do you only need files from your Home Folder or the entire Macintosh HD? \nAdditionally, Time Machine backups are not bootable and if what you're looking for is a full bootable backup of the systems at a given point in time, you need to make a bootable clone of the drive at that time. You can use SuperDuper!, Carbon Copy Cloner or from the Recovery HD, use Disk Utility or in Terminal from the Recovery HD use hdiutil, etc.\n", "Q: Apple Profiles - Apple Configurator 2 I've been looking for hours now on how to edit a profile on Apple Configurator but to no luck.

Since upgrading to iOS 10, in certain e-mail accounts (notably an msn.com account) I cannot delete certain messages in Apple Mail. If I swipe left or open the message, and click the Trash icon, I get an error message\n\nUnable to Move Message\nThe message could not be moved to the mailbox Trash.\n\nThis appears to happen only for messages that have already been deleted via a different client (e.g., Apple Mail on macOS) but that still appear in iOS. No matter how long I wait, these messages do not correctly sync with the iOS client on their own, and manually deleting them produces the error above.\nAll the instructions I've found online for addressing this (apparently common) issue either do not apply to iOS 10 or simply have no effect (repeating the same error). The only way to delete a message once this error occurs for it is to disable and then re-enable the offending account, or delete and re-add the account entirely. The account then correct syncs with the server and shows the already deleted messages as gone. But that only works until the error happens again.\nHow do I avoid \"message could not be moved to the mailbox Trash\" on iOS 10?\n\nA: Here's what I did to fix things...\n(EDITED, BECAUSE PREVIOUS WAY DIDN'T WORK...

Will it function as the original hard drive did, that is to say will it boot up into Mac OS X Lion and be fully functional or can it only be used as a backup?\n\nA: No, you cannot. Your Time Machine backup isn't a real clone of your hard drive — it's a time-based collection of all the files on your hard drive. \nIt's a little intensive to do this process, so proceed with caution if you follow the steps below.

If you have another external hard drive you can use temporarily, you can switch them out without losing your backups; if you only have the 500GB external hard drive, you can do still do it, but you'll lose your old backups. \nI would do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable MacOS USB drive\n\n*Shut down your computer and replace the internal hard drive with the 500GB hard drive\n\n*Wipe the 500GB hard disk and reinstall MacOS using the MacOS USB drive\n\n*On first boot during the initial setup process, select the option to restore from another computer hard drive\n\n*After that is done, you are free to wipe the 250GB hard drive and use it for your future Time Machine backups\n\n", "Q: USB2, USB3, iPad 2 and iPad Pro I have one USB 2 and one USB 3 hub, both connected to a USB3 port of my mac. The USB 3 hub has a small number of ports, so I have to pick exactly what will use that hub. Both hubs are powered. I have one iPad 1, an iPad 2, an iPad Pro, an Apple TV4 and an iPhone 6. I develop apps for iOS, so I need these devices to be connected on the right hub for them. Will it make any difference to connect them on the USB 2 or 3 hub? I mean in terms of data transmission speed. I don't want to waste a USB 3 fast port on a slow device.\n\nA: As of August 2017, only the 12.9” and 10.5” iPad Pro (not the 9.7” iPad Pro) support USB 3 transfer speeds. No other iPad, iPhone, iPod, or tv does.\nThis is confirmed by Apple’s Store page for the Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter:\n\nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 10.5-inch iPad Pro transfer data at USB 3 speeds, while the 9.7-inch iPad Pro uses USB 2.\n\nThe problem is that the USB-to-Lightning cable Apple provides is only a USB 2 cable. You’d need a USB 3.0-to-Lightning cable, or some kind of adapter, to benefit from the greater transfer speeds. Those do not exist yet, and even Apple’s USB-C to Lightning Cable only supports data transfer at up to USB 2.0 (480 Mbps) speeds.\nFurthermore, System Information lists my iPhone 7+ as having a maximum transfer speed of 480 Mbps when connected to one of the main USB 3 ports on my iMac. This is consistent with USB 2 transfer speeds, which confirms that so far, no iPhone supports USB 3 transfers, at least not with Apple’s official Lightning cables.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the 4th generation tv supports USB 3 transfers. It does include a USB Type-C port, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it supports USB 3 speeds. For what it’s worth, there’s a USB 2-to-Ethernet chip inside TV 4, per iFixit. I doubt Apple would include a USB 3 port in tv, when most users would rarely, if ever use it, while leaving other devices with USB 2 that would benefit from USB 3.\nIf you want to be certain, plug your tv 4 into one of your Mac’s builtin USB 3 ports, and check System Information.\nIn summary: Connect your Apple mobile devices to the USB 2 hub.\n", "Q: Is there a way to add Services to the Trash Can's context menu? I am wondering if there is a way to add custom Services to the Trash Can's context menu (specifically the context menu that appears when right clicking the Trash Can from the dock rather than in a Finder window.). The reasoning is that I've built a series of simple programs to replicate the functionality of the now-deprecated \"Securely Empty Trash\" option in Finder, but I don't want to put it up for download until it has a proper OS-integrated feel. \n\nA: In Yosemite and before, maybe (though exactly how is off-topic for this site), but specifically with El Capitan and forward, it's no longer possible to inject code into running processes, which is about the only way I can think of that you'd be able to override a system menu like that.\n", "Q: I think my Apple ID was hacked, changed my password twice but failed, what to do?

I can drag the space from the bar to the desktop.\nIt tends to leave behind a semi transparent image of the full screen view (similar to the one that can be dragged around in mission control) and this persists even after mission control is closed.  The only way to get rid of it is to restart my machine.\nWhat's going on and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Just to reconfirm that I understand it correct, the issue is: \nOn trying to move full-screen apps between two spaces by going into spaces (press F3 button or 3-finger swipe above), it (full-screen app) just slips to one the desktops and doesn't get accommodated like desktops (space is created automatically by the GUI for insertion and you can drop the desktop there). \nHave found the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Generally restarting the Mac solves this issue for some time (few days) but then it returns again. \n\n*Once the full screen app drops into one of the desktops, pick it and insert it where you want in the top spaces panel. \n\n\nThis is not exactly a solution but a workaround or change of habit if you don't want to restart your mac for something so trivial.\nHope this helps in reducing the inconvenience. \n", "Q: How to downgrade SMC firmware I have a MacBook Pro 6,2.

I noticed that if I reset the SMC nadn NVRAM, AirPort connects and works for several minutes and then stops again.\nI have the idea to downgrade to the previous firmware version hoping it will sove the issue. The version I currently have is EFI: MBP61.0057.B11 (2015-002) and SMC: 1.58f17 (SMC 1.7).\nI have found this: https://support.apple.com/pl-pl/HT201518 but it says only what is the latest version. I'm looking for the previous one.\nIs it possible that the firware update has broken my Wifi ?  Could anybody suggest a site where can I find list of SMC and EFI software versions proper for my MBP6.2?\n\nA: *\n\n*Download the 1.69f3 SMC 1.5 Update from (MacBook Pro SMC Firmware Update 1.5). This gives you the file \"MacBookProSMCUpdate.dmg\", mount that and look for the file \"MBP15.pkg\" and copy that to your HD.\n\n\n*Download unpkg from (http://www.timdoug.com/unpkg/) and install it.\n\n\n*Open unpkg and drop the file \"MBP15.pkg\" on it. This unpacks that file into a folder called MBP15. Open MBP15 ▸ System ▸ Library ▸ CoreServices ▸ Firmware Updates and locate the file \"MBP15SMC15.smc\". Copy this to a folder on your desktop called SMC or something like that.\n\n\n*Now download the 1.69f4 SMC 1.7 Update from (MacBook Pro SMC Firmware Update 1.7). This files is also called \"MacBookProSMCUpdate.dmg\" so mine was renamed \"MacBookProSMCUpdate (1).dmg\" this may vary on your system so make sure you know which file is which. Mount this file and look fot the file \"MacBookProSMCUpdate.pkg\" and copy that to your HD.\n\n\n*Open unpkg again and drop the file \"MacBookProSMCUpdate.pkg\" on it. This gives you a folder called MacBookProSMCUpdate. Open MacBookProSMCUpdate ▸ MBP91 ▸ System ▸ Library ▸ CoreServices ▸ Firmware Updates and locate the file \"SmcFlasher.efi\" and \"VerifyRequirements\". Copy those to the SMC folder you created earlier. That folder should now contain 3 files \"MBP15SMC15.smc, SmcFlasher.efi and VerifyRequirements\". I´m not sure if that last file is needed but this worked for me. I also renamed the file \"MBP15SMC15.smc\" to \"2011MBP15.smc\" because that is the name of the 1.7 SMC that is used with that version of SmcFlasher.efi, again i´m not sure if this is needed.\n\n\n*We need a way to boot into an EFI shell. Download the disk image for rEFIt from (http://refit.sourceforge.net/). Mount that and copy the folder \"efi\" to the same place as your \"SMC\" folder, for me this was my desktop.\n\n\n*Use a USB drive, i used a simple 2GB stick, format that as HFS+ journaled extended, GUID partition table. Copy the two folders \"SMC\" and \"efi\" onto that drive. Start Terminal and run the script \"enable.sh\" that is located in \"efi/refit\" on your USB drive. Once again i´m not sure if that script is needed but this is how i did it =)\n\n\n*Boot your MacBook Pro and hold down \"Alt\", choose to boot from your USB drive. This brings up the rEFIt user interface, choose the icon that looks like the Terminal. This boots up your EFI shell. It will show you a list of your available drives. My thumb drive was fs2 so i just typed fs2: to mount that. If you mount the wrong one you can just type that command again, for example fs3: and so on. When you find the right one you can type \"ls\" and it should show you that you have the folders \"efi\" and \"SMC\". Type \"cd SMC\" to go into that folder. Type \"ls\" again and make sure your 3 files are there.\n\n\n*Now the fun part =) MAKE SURE YOU ARE CONNECTED TO A POWER SUPPLY BEFORE PROCEEDING!\nType \"SmcFlasher.efi -reset 1\" and then type \"SmcFlasher.efi -force -LoadApp 2011MBP15.smc\", your fans should now go to max and it will start flashing you SMC.

When clicking on such an icon, the website is displayed in Safari.\nIs there some way to start a separate browser instance when clicking on such a \"home screen bookmark\", i.e., one which does not share state with the regular Safari instance. This would make it possible to delete state (cookies, website data etc.) of one instance without affecting the other. In addition, both instances would be isolated from each other.\nIs this possible by some means?\n\nA: No, it's not possible.  Currently, Home Screen bookmarks open the same instance of Safari.\n", "Q: How to prevent iPhone from muting ringtone by side switch? The software side configuration of the side switch on iPhones (unlike iPads) was in one of the last iOS betas, but didn't make it through.\nIs there any other trick to prevent an iPhone from being accidentally muted via the side switch?\nAlthough convenient, I don't need the side switch to lock screen orientation - I just don't want to miss calls because it switched to \"mute\" in the pocket.\nApart from applying glue, that is.\n\nA: Simply put, you can’t.\nThe best you can do is to make sure Settings → Sounds & Haptics → Vibrate on Silent is switched On. You can’t otherwise override the hardware mute switch.\nYou joked about applying glue, but a hardware solution does exist in the form of a case. With many iPhone cases, including Apple’s own Leather and Silicone Cases, surround the hardware Mute switch. Recessed in such a way, it becomes harder to switch off by accident.\nOr you can also get an WATCH… \n", "Q: Language switcher lag When I am changing the language layout (English <-> Bulgarian) most of the times I have huge lag or even buggy behavior.

So I've been trying to find a Windows iOS 9 emulator and failed, but came across Xcode. I have a Windows laptop but I can use either visualbox or VMware to run macOS El Capitan.\nI found out that Mac OS has Xcode which is basically an iOS emulator. I need that emulator for one reason only - to be able to use iCloud and restore. From Apple's site I saw a picture of that emulator and saw iCloud option in settings. However, is that emulator capable of something as complex as restoring from an actual active iCloud and copy all my files from my iPhone onto that emulator and show all the files I have on my iPhone on that emulator?\nI really don't want to go through all the trouble of running Mac OS on Windows and then Xcode with a potential to mess something up to then realize the emulator cannot restore from iCloud. If any of you guys are aware or would test it and respond, I would be forever grateful. There's a reason I need it done that way so don't bother telling me it's kind of stupid.\n\nA: Xcode is not an emulator. Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS and iOS software that happens to include an iOS simulator for the purposes of testing software that is in development.\nNo, you cannot restore an iCloud backup onto it. It can only be used to run software being developed in Xcode.\n", "Q: What is Swipe Options in Settings? What are swipe options and what are their functions?\n\nA: In Mail on iOS, you can swipe messages left or right to perform quick actions on that message, such as archiving or marking as read. The action performed when swiping in a certain direction is configured in Settings → Mail (Contacts & Calendars) → Swipe Options.\n\nA: To quickly delete an email, swipe left or right and hold.

I can create a launcher app using Platypus (see this answer). But the actual spyder-application opens a new (ugly) dock icon labeled \"python\" next to it:\n\nThe confusion starts when I want to switch to the Spyder app: I have to click on the python icon and not on the spyder one...\n\nA: Platypus is not necessarily needed to add an icon to spyder:\nStarting spyder in the CLI is a two stage process:\n~/anaconda/bin/spyder is a shell script executing the \"proxy app\" ~/anaconda/bin/python.app which itself launches another \"proxy app\" ~/anaconda/python.app/Contents/MacOS/python including an argument.\n\nSince the last shell script resides in an app bundle you can simply add an icon:\nThe two proxy apps are \"wrappers/launchers\" for all other python science apps included in Anaconda. You don't want to break Anaconda - therefore you have to create two \"spyder-only\" launchers.\nMake a copy of ~/anaconda/bin/python.app: ~/anaconda/bin/python.spyder.app and change the shell script inside (don't forget to also change the user in the path!). \n#!/bin/bash\nexport PYTHONEXECUTABLE=/Users/user/anaconda/bin/python\n/Users/user/anaconda/python.spyder.app/Contents/MacOS/python \"$@\"\n\nThen create a copy of ~/anaconda/python.app: ~/anaconda/python.spyder.app and add an icon to it.\nStarted from the Terminal the command spyder will launch python.spyder.app with the custom icon.\nNow you may use Platypus to create an app to launch spyder (instead of using Terminal.app). Use the following settings:\n\nThis may break after an Anaconda or a spyder update.\n\nI don't think you can run spyder with a single spyder dock icon (with the Platypus spyder launcher as a permanent Dock item) because the python.spyder.app/python.app itself is a wrapper for spyder again. So after hitting the Platypus spyder app icon in the Dock you will always get a second spyder icon - the reason why your solution shows the default python.app icon.\n\nA: This question is more of a programming question than a usability question, however it would probably have to be done programmatically as macOS normally looks for the icon inside the Application as part of a .plist file, and your application doesn't have this presumably because it's being run from command line as a script.\nHave a look at: Changing Cocoa app icon, title and menu labels at runtime\n", "Q: How to avoid getting 'Missing File' error in Photos app? I get the following error in Photos app on my Mac.\nMissing File\nPhotos with unavailable original files cannot be opened.\nThe original photo “IMG_3076.JPG” is either offline or cannot be found. Click “Find Original” to reconnect.\n\nThis is what has happened, I assumed that since the photo is in the Photo Library I could delete the file from the hard drive. Apparently not. The reason I deleted the files was to avoid duplication and save disk space. When I right click and look at the info for the photo, I see that the size and dimensions of the image are same as the original file. So I am really not precious about the file being there.\nSo I have the following questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I prevent Photo app from showing this error?\n\n*Will I be able to export these files and edit them as normal?\n\n\nHere is screenshot of Photos app preferences\n\n\nA: It depends whether the file was actually duplicated...\nFrom Photos prefs\n\nIf you have that pref set, then the original becomes redundant once imported, as Photos now refers to its saved internal copy as the 'original'.\nIf unchecked, then the original remains where it was on your drive & if deleted can no longer be found by Photos [or indeed anything else, as it really no longer exists.]\nIf that option hasn't always been checked, then some files will still be externally referenced & need to be copied to the Library before they can be finally discarded from their original locations.\nThe way to achieve this will be to initially return all those files you discarded to the locations Photos expects them to be.\nThe you can use File Menu > Consolidate, which will copy all those external references into the Photos Library.\nOnce this is complete, then you can finally discard the external files safely.\n", "Q: MacBook DNS works behind some routers, doesn't behind others I've found WiFi routers where I cannot open domains, but ping IP addresses just fine.

Keep in mind, though many networks are similar in configuration, no network is exactly alike.\nThere are many different reasons why you experienced what you did, and it would be impossible without actually looking at your individual configuration, but suffice to say the static setup you had working in one network wasn't exactly right for the other network and may have been good enough for the third network, and so on.\nThis is why it's good (among other reasons like IP address conflicts), when going between various networks, to obtain the network settings via DHCP.

I don't have an unlimited Wi-Fi connection as I use my Samsung mobile phone hotspot for my iPhone.\nWhenever I connect my iPhone to Wi-Fi, it starts using very high quantities of data, i.e, 2–3 MB every second without any app running. I also tried turning of Background App Refresh and Automatic Downloads are turned off. I tried a soft reset but to no avail. Any idea what's causing this?\n\nA: EDIT: Below is my original answer (for posterity). It describes turning off \"Wi-Fi Assist\" which, while reducing cellular data use, DOES NOT answer OP's question of reducing data use. For Apple's built-in solution to reduce data usage on cellular, see my other answer.\nGo to settings -> cellular. Scroll down past the list of apps to \"Wi-Fi Assist\" and turn it off!

I’ve got a MBP 13′ (mid-2010) 2.4 Core 2 Duo (full specs below) that I’m now operating solely under Win7 64Bit. It formerly run as well under OS X 10.6.8, relatively to which the firmware seems up to date (MBP71.0039.B0B).\nWould my system recognize 16 GB RAM if operated under Win7 64 Bit? Or would it require the latest firmware (MBP71.0039.B0E) of OS-X 10.7.5 (which was never installed on my MBP) anyway? \nAs far as I have read elsewhere, using 16 GB RAM under OS X seems to definitely require this later version of OS X (including the respective firmware update); so I'd like to know whether this is an issue of OS X or (as I suspect) the firmware. \n\n\n*\n\n*Modellname: MacBook Pro\n\n*Modell-Identifizierung: MacBookPro7,1\n\n*Prozessortyp: Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*Prozessorgeschwindigkeit: 2,4 GHz\n\n*Anzahl der Prozessoren: 1\n\n*Gesamtzahl der Kerne: 2\n\n*L2-Cache: 3 MB\n\n*Speicher: 4 GB\n\n*Busgeschwindigkeit: 1,07 GHz\n\n*Boot-ROM-Version: MBP71.0039.B0B\n\n*SMC-Version (System): 1.62f6\n\n\nA: According to Apple your MacBook Pro only supports 8 GB RAM, however Mactracker says it will support 16 GB.\nAlso at MacSales.com have a look at Upgrades for MacBook and MacBook Pro 'Unibody' Models 2008 – 2010 and 16.0GB OWC Memory Upgrade Kit show your model MBP supporting 16 GB RAM. Or at Crucial, see: Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010) compatible upgrades\n\n\nA: Your particular MacBook Pro can, per EveryMac.com, support up to 16GB of RAM.  \n\nAs noted in the specs, it would need to be updated past 10.7.5 to obtain the latest EFI updates so that it would recognize the 16GB.  So, prior to installing the memory, you should install a newer OS Mavericks, Yosemite, etc. should be fine.\nBased on your question about the firmware version, according to Apple Support, you have the latest version; so your system should be able to address the full 16GB\n\nAs for the memory, I have personally installed a Crucial 16GB PC3-8500 kit in my mid-2010 MacBook Pro with zero issues.

However, in certain applications (Office and Slack, possibly more) the layout switches back to the original British PC layout.\nAlso, I'm on Sierra.\nHow can I get my keyboard layout to persist?\n\nA: The solution to this issue is to uncheck the \"Automatically switch to a document's input source\" checkbox in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources.\nIf the keyboard layout is wrong then select the correct layout.\n", "Q: I want to change login type of a local user to a network (AD) user I am using macOS 10.12, Sierra, and I've two local accounts (the one created during unboxing and a backup one).\nThis is a work laptop and I would like to use my Active Directory credentials to login instead of the loca account.

I also deleted the partitions using fdisk in Linux.\nIs there a way to repair this behavior? And if not, is there a way I can redefine how the partitions are getting assigned by macOS so that I can still manually mount them?\n\nA: There's nothing wrong with what you are seeing.  That's the partition scheme for your bootable USB.  When you format it, you are not deleting the partition, just \"blanking\" the active partition.\nFormatting a partition is not the same as deleting the partition.\nTo get back to a \"single\" partition (this is what I am assuming you want to do), issue this command in diskutil\ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk3 1 GPT HFS+ NAME 100%\nThis command will permanently delete anything you have on the device.  Make sure you are using the correct device identifier\nBe sure to replace \"NAME\" with the name you want to give to the USB.\nYour drive partition map will be wiped, and the HFS+ (Mac OS Extended) file system installed.\nWhat I suspect happened in your case is that you didn't \"write\" the new partition scheme to the USB.  This is done by issuing the \"w\" command.  Linuxhelp has an excellent tutorial on fdisk\n\nMore info can be found by typing man diskutil\n", "Q: How do I import photos in to the Photos Library completely? I get the following error in Photos app on my Mac.\nMissing File\nPhotos with unavailable original files cannot be opened.\nThe original photo “IMG_3076.JPG” is either offline or cannot be found. Click “Find Original” to reconnect.\n\nThis is what has happened, I assumed that since the photo is in the Photos Library I could delete the file from the hard drive. Apparently not. The answer by @Tetsujin suggests that this is not the case.\n\nI have a backup of all these files and I can restore these. \nMy question is, How do I import these files into the Photo Library completely, so that there is no longer any need to keep the file as well?\n\nA: Restoring them to their original location is the best plan. Then use File > Consolidate (as suggested by @Tetsujin here) to ensure all items are copied into the library. Your settings (as shown in the screenshot in your other question) are set correctly for Photos to manage the library and the originals to be able to be removed from your hard drive. This time I would just rename the folder they're in and see what happens. That way you can quickly and easily undo it if it still isn't working correctly.\nUnless you are referring to the Masters folder (within the .photoslibrary bundle) as the originals. In that case - leave the photoslibrary bundle alone. You cannot remove files from it and expect them to keep working in Photos.\n", "Q: How much free space needs to be available in order to download from iCloud Drive? Yesterday I discovered an unfortunate thing: iCloud Drive had apparently detected that I had too little free disk space for its tastes, and then it had decided to upload my ~180 GB VM image to iCloud and delete it from my local hard drive.\nSince then, I have freed lots of space, totaling around 280 available GB – but iCloud Drive refuses to download my VM, saying that I have too little available disk space!\n\nTo make matters worse, the web-based download accessible here consistently fails after having downloaded a few GB. I am of course trying to download the file to a file that is not synchronized by iCloud Drive.\nDoes anyone know 1) How much space does iCloud Drive actually need in order to be able to retrieve a file?, and 2) Is there any other way for me to retrieve the file?\n\nA: The current belief is that it starts complaining about free disk space somewhere around 20% left. So if you have 282 GB free and are trying to download 185 GB, that would leave 77 GB free, which is less than 20% of your 500 GB hard drive.\nI don't believe there's anywhere that codifies what \"low\" means in this context, though, so I can't point you to an official source that says it's 20%.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro doesn't react to any key combinaton at start up I have a Macbook pro 2009. I had to do a hard reset on it. I was at the installing stage, when it just shut down itself, and now, when I turn it on, only the folder with the question mark is flashing.\nBut my problem is that, I cannot go back to recovery mode, or any other mode. When I shutdown, and turn it back (while pressing the right key combinations) and just gets to the flashing folder again.\nMaybe I dont shut it down correcty? It doesnt even show the loading bar. Just a white screen, then the folder.\nAny help?\nThanks\n\nA: This occurs when there is no information on any hard drive that the computer can process. This means that at some point you likely accidentally deleted the recovery partition of your hard drive. There is no regular recovery partition so the computer has no idea what to do.\nYou need to have a bootable USB drive to do anything with that computer besides use it as a very expensive paperweight. Find a USB drive and someone with a Mac and make yourself an OS X (or MacOS) install disk. Then boot from that drive (by holding down Option during boot). Then wipe your internal drive and install the OS (which will automatically install a recovery partition).\n", "Q: Screenshot Folder For some reason lately, whenever I take a screenshot, it will show up in the desktop folder for a second, and then disappear and I cannot find them. Does anyone know where they go? \n\nA: This is the procedure you need to follow to change your screenshot default's location.\nStep 1: Open Terminal\nStep 2: Type the following command: defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop, if you want to save the screenshots in the Desktop.\nStep 3: Press enter(return key). \nStep 4: Paste this command to save changes and see immediate effect: killall SystemUIServer and press return again.\n\nA: I would disconnect from any network in case you have iCloud syncing your desktop. Then perhaps log out and/or restart once you are disconnected and then re-test.\nMissing files can be a sign of corruption, so you might check that your backup is current and then see about following the diagnosis steps to boot to recovery mode and check your drive catalog for errors or hardware failure:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\n", "Q: Album not eligible for iCloud Music Library.

Is it possible to manually buy this in-app purchase through the App Store?\n\nA: No.  You can only do an in-app purchase through the app (that's the 'in-app' part).\nIf there's a glitch in the existing app you can either fix it, create a new app, or direct users to your website to make the purchase (there's a bunch of Apple rules about doing that so be sure to check your Apple Developer agreement).\n", "Q: Why does find-certificates have some missing?

This is annoying to fix, as I have to move my mouse and click to fix it every time. Is there a way to set a hotkey to toggle the sound output for me? something like command+shift+s\n\n\nA: Since you only have the two output devices, the following code will toggle between the two.\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to ¬\n    reveal anchor \"output\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n        repeat until exists tab group 1 of window \"Sound\"\n            delay 0.1\n        end repeat\n        tell tab group 1 of window \"Sound\"\n            if (selected of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1) then\n                set selected of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 to true\n            else\n                set selected of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 to true\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nI test this as an Automator Service using a Run AppleScript action and then assigned it a hot-key combo and it works on my system having only two sound outputs.

On macOS Sierra, I am encountering a strange behaviour of WEBLOC files. In the Open with: section of the Info window, the drop down list for choosing the default application is greyed out. It is set to Safari even though I have chosen a different default web browser in the System Preferences. I would like to change it to the browser of my choice, but it appears I am stuck with Safari.\n\nWhen I select more than one WEBLOC file at once, the drop down list stops being greyed out. But when I try selecting a different browser, I get the following error message:\n\nYou can’t change the item “Ask Different.webloc” to always open in the selected application.\nThe item is either locked or damaged, or in a folder you don’t have permission to modify (error code -10823).\n\n\nNeedless to say that this particular WEBLOC file is neither locked nor damaged and that I have all the required permissions for the containing folder and the file.\nHow can I change the default application for WEBLOC files so they open with the browser of my choice?\n\nA: Please note: This solution no longer works in macOS 13 Ventura (or already before?). Please see the other answers for solutions that work (and downvote this answer).\nI have found a solution:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the Finder is set to show all filename extensions (Finder Preferences → Advanced).\n\n*Edit the file name by deleting the “.webloc” filename extension.\n\n*Show Info: Lo and behold – the application drop down list is no longer greyed out.\n\n\n*Select the browser of your choice and press the Change All… button.\n\n*The default application for opening any WEBLOC file has been changed, whether or not it has the explicit “.webloc” filename extension.\n\n\nA: The currently accepted answer doesn't work for me, but one way to make this work is to use the duti utility. You can install duti using homebrew or build from source.\nWarning: any time you change default applications you could end up doing something that is hard to reverse, and moreso when done via the command line, so proceed only if you are comfortable.\nTo instruct Finder to open all webloc files in Chrome, you just need to run the following command in the Terminal:\nduti -s com.google.Chrome com.apple.web-internet-location all\n\nI haven't tested this over a long period of time, so I don't know how long the effect lasts or if this will break in the future, but it works on MacOS 13.1.\n\nA: I found the following solution in Roy Caratozzolo’s answers to Default browser not working in Ventura 13.1. I am reposting Roy’s solution here hoping that more people will find it useful. Also, I guess this is basically the same answer as the one by Nathan Grigg but with settings panes instead of a CLI app.\nA way of setting a browser of your choice to open WEBLOC files is through a dedicated pane in the System Settings. There are at least two setting panes that will do the job:\n\n*\n\n*The SwiftDefaultApps settings pane:\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest SwiftDefaultsApps ZIP file from https://github.com/Lord-Kamina/SwiftDefaultApps/releases and doubleclick on the SwiftDefaultApps.prefpane you find inside.\n\n*The System Settings app will prompt you that the SwiftDefaultApps settings pane needs to be installed before it can be used. Do so by clicking on the Install button. \n\n*In the SwiftDefaultApps settings pane, go to the Uniform Type Identifiers tab and scroll down to the com.apple.web-internet-location entry. Then click on the Radio Button next to Other … in the Viewer section. A file selection window will appear where you can Add the browser of your choice. \n\n\n\n*The RCDefaultApp settings pane. This works very similar to the SwiftDefaultApps settings pane. It may prove more difficult to install since it is not signed (it appears to be from the days before app signing). It works very similar to SwiftDefaultApps (SwiftDefaultApps was modeled after it). Also, RCDefaultApp may no longer work on Apple Silicon Macs.\n\nCaveat:\n\n*\n\n*These settings panes do not have a reset option. The settings you make will persist even when you uninstall the pane afterwards. Of course, the default application for WEBLOC files can be easily changed back to Safari, but be careful not to change too many other settings.\n\n\nA: Old question, still an issue to this day in OSX Mojave 10.14.5\nI have found the best solution possible, although it is a couple steps just to do it.\nStill useful for shortcut files you use frequently on your desktop / folders\n\n\n*\n\n*Open AppleScript Editor (Script Editor)\n\n*Copy / Paste the following into the editor:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n\nactivate\n\nopen location \"https://www.url.com/\"\n\nend tell\n\n\n*Then File > Export...\n\n*File Format: Application\n\n*Choose a location and hit save. This will create a location.app which, when opened, will go into your Chrome browser instead of Safari! This will also work if you replace \"Google Chrome\" with \"Firefox\"\n\nA: In System Preferences>General (in Catalina at least), you can change your default web browser.

(By \"currently\" I mean using current software, whether from Apple or a third party, not by digging up ancient software.)\nIt would be fine if involves connecting to iTunes from other computers or from iOS devices, or whether it involves an Apple TV as the central point of control, where devices or computers connect to the Apple TV.\nAll I want is some way to allow input from multiple people in an office to determine what gets played and what gets skipped.  (It doesn't even need to be, strictly speaking, a \"voting\" metaphor that is used.  It could be  that anyone can veto specific songs, or the most popular go first, or whatever.)\n\nA: If voting is not relevant, and money is not an issue, you can set up a Spotify Collaborative Playlist.\nIt allows you to invite any Spotify user to edit your playlist.\nOther than that, searching for \"playlist voting app\" returns a great amount of apps that do different versions of what you are looking for, but I haven't tried any of them.\nhttps://outloud.dj/ seems particularly promising:\n\nAt your next party, everybody controls the music.\n  Mash your Spotify and iTunes playlists with those of your friends and build the ultimate playlist.\n  Add any song through Spotify, even if you don't have an account.\n  Project your playlist onto your TV with the push of a button.\n  The app is free and no sign-ins and set-ups required.   \n\n\nA: Yes, you can use Apple Music to create a channel for yourself and others who can dj and queue up songs together on the same platform channel. They would just need to know your channel name and have iTunes/Apple Music etc. a matching platform.\n", "Q: Spam from NY Times & WSJ top stories notifications on iPhone A while ago, my wife and I started seeing news story alerts on our iPhones on the lock screen. We didn't think much about it.\nBut now these notifications are spaming us daily with garbage news stories about the election. I'd like to modify the settings that control what, if any, stories we get alerts for.  \nIdeally, I'd like to control which news sources can send alerts and what type of alerts, e.g. business stories from WSJ.  Neither of us has the NY Times app installed. The alerts may be coming from the News app, but the only settings are \"Allow Notifications\", \"Show in Notification Center\", \"Badge App Icon\", \"Show on Lock Screen\" and \"Alert Style When Unlocked\".\nDoes anyone know where the settings are which control these alerts?\n\nA: The below instructions apply to iOS 10. There will be similar settings on previous versions of iOS, though the steps may differ somewhat.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the News app and tap on the Favorites tab at the bottom.\n\n*Tap on the bell icon in the top-left corner.\n\n*Toggle off any channels that you don't want to receive notifications from. You can also toggle on any channels from which you do want to receive them.\n\n*Tap Done in the top-right corner to save.\nIf the channels (i.e. NYT and WSJ) you're getting notifications from aren't there, or you want to get notifications from channels that aren't present, you may have to temporarily add them as favorites to cause them to appear.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on the Search tab at the bottom. Search for \"New York Times\" or \"Wall Street Journal\".\n\n*Tap on the channel's name.\n\n*Tap the + icon in the top-right corner.\n\n*Go back to the Favorites tab and follow the above instructions to turn notifications on or off, as applicable.\n\n*Once you tap Done on the notifications screen, you can remove the channels you just added as favorites if you want to do so. To do this, tap Edit in the top-right corner, and tap the X in the upper-left corner of each channel you want to remove.\nThe type of notifications you can get from a channel appears to be all or nothing for a channel, so unless the channel is split into specific sections, you can't opt just for Business stories, for example. There are also generalized \"News Editors' Picks\" and \"News Top Stories\" options. From my (admittedly limited) testing, you can't get notifications for topics (such as Business) that combine many channels into one categorized feed.\nIf the notifications aren't turned on in the News app, I have no idea where they're coming from. In that case, the next time it happens, take a screenshot (Home + Sleep) and post it in your question to help determine the source.\n", "Q: How to use an old MacBook Pro as a display? I have 2 MacBooks:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2011)\n\n\nI want to use the old MacBook as a display. How?

In a nutshell, it says to use a third party app such as Air Display or Screen Recycler (both of which, it appears, operate over a network.

If you'd like to see a one-liner to do this on the command line I can do this, but it depends on what you want it to output- the containing directory or the full path to the file.\n\nA: This is one of those situations I'd just use EasyFind - freeware from the App Store.\nIt's slower than Spotlight, as it doesn't use an index, but its search parameters are far more easily defined & no Terminal-fu required.\n", "Q: Unable to set live wallpaper in iOS 10 On iOS 10, when you go to select a wallpaper, you can select live photos.

I'm using App cleaner \nI downloaded Appcleaner from App store and want to clean up to get some more space.\nI have two versions of Xcode; 7.3 and 8.0. So there's no problem with two executable files but I'm wondering what that 'Application support' files are for. The bigger one takes up almost 19 gigabytes..\nMay i delete that one?\n\nA: *\n\n*Cache: Sure. Haven't noticed anything bad. (You can do this yourself, as well – just trash everything in ~/Library/Caches.)\n\n*Application Support: Do not do this without knowing what's in there! Apps often use this to store configuration – for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xcode puts color themes and key bindings there.\n\n*The Dock puts your spaces configuration there.\n\n*GIMP uses it to hold all sorts of things like gradients and palette images.\n\n*Steam uses it to store your entire game library. (If it's taking up way too much space, try uninstalling some games.) Not sure if progress is there too, but it seems likely.\n\n\n\nDeleting Application Support won't break the app (it'll just create it again the next time it starts), but you might lose configuration and other data, like key bindings for Xcode. You also might want to make sure the app is closed before you take its folders out from under it. (:\n\nA: I am using AppCleaner and I searched for this question specifically because I downloaded Xcode 9 with 8.3 still installed on my mac.\nLong story short; you can safely delete Application Support if you do not have any issue with losing any or all configurations previously set on the app. I did it for a bunch of apps like Spotify to free up space and as far as I can tell everything works smoothly.\n", "Q: Cisco AnyConnect denies connection after failing to recognize antivirus First I'd like to say...\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't typically install antivirus on my computers but I had to make an exception for a client. \n\n*I've talked to their help desk about this issue and aside from providing a spreadsheet of approved antivirus apps for Mac I have had no luck getting AnyConnect to recognize that I have installed one. Tried a few actually. \n\n*They did ask some other people in company on Macs and they said they were running the AnyConnect in a windows vm and I'm guessing making windows act like a proxy for specific traffic. Not exactly sure how that is being configured, but that's my last resort. \n\n\nSo now the question, does anyone know what AnyConnect is checking? Is it a path? Or something else? I've been wondering if I can force it or fake it. My client doesn't want me to settle for Windows since their network people say they support it. No response from network dept on that so I'm on my own or have to hack together some obtuse solution. \nSo if anyone has any suggestions that would be awesome. \nThanks! \n\nA: I cannot say I fully grok how anti-virus comes into play with your VPN software, but AnyConnect is a notoriously flaky VPN client. You are better off using the native VPN connection built into the OS. You will need to create a new Cisco VPN connection and most importantly, You will need the gateway IP, Group ID, and shared secret for your connection from your IT folk. You may find them quite reasonable about giving your that especially if you are are being locked out and can solve your problem with some self-sufficiency.\n", "Q: Can I use a Time Machine backup to recover deleted Notes that were stored in iCloud? I removed the Notes app from my iPhone and thereby lost all the notes that had been stored in iCloud. (Stupid, I know.) I have a Time Machine backup from shortly before I lost the notes. I've tried restoring the contents of ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/ and ~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/ but that hasn't worked.\nFrom opening the NoteStore.sqlite file under Group Containers I can tell that at least some of the lost content is in there, but it's hard to make much sense of. I tried opening the same file in an SQLite app but I don't really know what I'm doing and can't find the content that way.\nAny suggestions? Thanks.\n\nA: What is possibly happening is iCloud is overwriting your restore. Be sure sync is turned off before you attempt to restore the database files. Then, manually update Notes and turn sync on so your local copy is the newest one. I believe it will attempt to merge.\n\nA: You don't say what version of macOS you are using, but there is software that will export your notes from the SQLite database into a usable format.\nnotes-export:\n\nExport HTML copies of your notes from Apple Notes\n\nmac-notes-exporter:\n\nSQLite3 Command-line Shell Program\n\nYou may find other options with a Google search.\n", "Q: Methods for copying Time Machine backups offsite I presently use an external USB drive to back up my Mac Mini with Time Machine which is a little about 1.5 TB total, however, I would really like to be able to trickle those backups onto some other cloud provider or even another location on a desktop located at a different office so I am protected from a massive catastrophe. I realize that upstream bandwidth is a major factor in successfully doing this. (I only have 10 megabit upstream.) I have tried to use ARQ which uses S3 backup, and while it works very well, the costs associated could end up being astronomical which I consider backup up my music, movies, etc..., not to mention the the loads of incidental file changes that I I don't need to capture every time. Also, there is simply no way it could ever catch up with with the amount of TM data that gets churned.\nWhat I am looking for is a solution geared specifically for copying Time Machine backups to a cloud location, and does some things to reduce the amount of data that has to be pushed over the pipe. I would be accept having the Time Machine backups that are pushed offsite be far less frequent and I would accept some lag in getting these backups shipped, but I want to have SOMETHING in case I have a catastrophic incident, like a fire or water is spilled on my computer and Time Machine drive simultaneously.\nSolutions like Mozy and Carbonite are simply not well geared for MacOS with its heavy reliance on datastores vs files. Attempting to rebuild an iTunes library from files would be a nightmare.\nI am having trouble finding anything out there geared for this, but if you have some suggestions, I am all ears.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly (and I may not) you would prefer a cloud solution but would be willing to consider another non-cloud offsite solution.\nMy preference is not to use the cloud for this type of backup. The cloud is fine for low volume data storage and file services (e.g. Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, MS OneDrive, etc), but for this type of backup it's not (at least not yet).\nInstead, my recommendation is to do something similar to what I am doing. By way of example, I'll explain how I do this for my iMac (but I follow a similar process for all my machines!)\n\n\n*\n\n*This iMac has a 500GB HDD\n\n*I have purchased two portable USB 2TB external hard drives\n\n*I have labelled these hard drives as iMac TM Backup HD 1 and iMac TM Backup HD 2\n\n*I set both of these external drives to be TM backup drives\n\n*As both drives are set up with TM they are alternated whenever both drives are available\n\n*Once the initial backups are done, I physically remove one of the external drives and take it 'offsite'\n\n*On the same day each week, I then swap them over\n\n*The net result is that both hard drives will have backups in the order of one week on, one week off (but between them I have a full set of backups).\n\n\nNow, in terms of keeping one of them offsite, you have a number of options. Over the years I have used as my offsite location any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*My workplace\n\n*A shed in the back yard\n\n*My car (but this may depend on your climate and where you 'garage' your car)\n\n*A family member's/friend's place (assuming you trust them!)\n\n\nBasically, the idea is that your offsite drive is somewhere that protects your data in the event your house burns down or you get robbed. My strong suggestion would be in a locked drawer at your workplace (unless you work at home). Most people's workplaces are air-conditioned, secure, and convenient.\nIMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT STORAGE\nRegardless of the 'offsite' location you choose to keep your hard drive, there are some key factors to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always keep the drive safe from large magnetic fields!\n\n*Ensure the location has a temperature range between 10 degrees celsius (50 degrees fahrenheit) and 43 degrees celsius (110 degrees fahrenheit). So, keeping it in a car would usually not be a good idea.\n\n\nA: I would like to report that I ended up with a better than 3-2-1 solution that was very different from what I sought out to do in the fist pass. If you are interested in how I did it, please read on.\nFirst off, the attempts to upload Time Machine backups to a cloud data store was a bit of a catastrophe and frankly a bad idea from the start. I just couldn't efficiently upload the sparse bundles for some reason. Plus, I realized that with a 4 TB TM drive performing a restore would have been a nightmare. I was using Arq as my backup client which is normally blazingly fast with its multi-threading and over-the-wire compression. For whatever reason, it took Arq a very long time to scan the Time Machine backup data so upload speeds were always abysmal. I chalk this up to the nature of the TM data store and not Arq, which I can say after a thorough testing is otherwise rock solid, secure, extensively featured, has flexible overhead, and at top speed will probably smoke any other all-in-one provider. The big plus with Arq is that it supports so many cloud data stores so that regardless of the size of your data set, speed requirements, and data integrity needs, you can pick the right provider for you rather than get locked into a single vendor. Plus, it also supports SFTP so you can backup data locally or to a non-native cloud store like Backblaze B2 if you really wanted to.\nBecause I ended up choosing to have duplicated Time Machine backup drives (which I will swap out every week so one is offsite almost all of the time) and because I have several TB of data, I ended up choosing Amazon Cloud which is about $60/year for unlimited files. With my 30 Mb uplink I can saturate it and then some thanks to Arq's compression. I would probably only need to restore from it if there was an earthquake that knocked out both of my Time Machine backups, or to \"top\" off files if I had to backup from the offsited TM drive. Also, if there are concerns about data integrity over time, Arq has the feature to vigilantly validate the backups to make sure there is no data rot. If something fails a checksum it's dumped and uploaded again. If it is not available, you are told exactly what was lost. I now have my bases covered. I don't really need backups to the beginning of time but, saving corruption (I don't know how well things \"keep\" on Amazon Cloud) I will have what I need, which is up to a month's worth of history.\nSo, in the end I chose backing up my system directly rather than attempting the backup of a backup, which I realize now would have been fraught with peril anyway. Arq's clever techniques of avoiding the backup of unnecessary files seems to put it on par with what Backblaze does. When you restore, you still have to reinstall your apps, but all of your Library data (minus temp files) will be intact. I am backing up 2 hosts separately along with 2 TB of media. It is tearing through the first backup right now at around 3-4 MB/s and at this rate I'll be done by early next week. Cost-wise (and since I already owned Arq) this makes the most sense for me.\nIn conclusion, this approach ended up being the most convenient and cost effective way to provide 3-2-1 level backups of my data. Also, with much of my data on iCloud or DropBox it's actually more than that. I love the convenience of Time Machine, especially when it comes to restores. It's a one and done solution that will fully restore my system to what it was if I have to replace my Mac. The swapping of drives is a bit manual, but it's only once a week and I have a nice drive case for transport. If I have a fire or theft and am forced to restore from the slightly older offsite drive, I know I have the cloud backup to get my system up to current where necessary. Still, the cloud is mainly for peace of mind in case things really go sideways. I hopefully will never need it, but if I ever do, I will be glad I spent the small amount for it. I hope that documenting this entire exercise will be helpful to others.\n\nA: Backblaze - $5/m. It doesn't back up the OS itself, as that's easily restored from Apple, but it backs the rest of the machine. I set mine to run overnight so it doesn't upset my ISP's quotas.  \nFirst full backup took about two months - something like 2TB of data, but now it seems to shift around 20GB a night. It will keep archived any external device it sees at least every month. Backups are retrievable by date, similar to Time Machine itself.  \nYou can restore single files, folders or the entire archive; over a web interface, or if it's just too big, they will ship it on an appropriately-sized HD [at an extra cost]\nIt doesn't backup Time Machine itself, as that would be redundant, nor does it backup Boot Camp Partitions.\nBackups can be encrypted. Don't forget the password, Backblaze cannot recover it if you lose it.\nThere's a month's free trial, during which you can test its capabilities, including restore of anything so far uploaded.\nI've never needed it [so far, touch wood] for full disaster recovery, but I've tested it on fairly large structures like the Photos Library, which I recovered successfully.\n\nA: A possible cheap solution could be using an extra drive (Time Machine supports that), and storing it offsite. You could even store it in a safety deposit box if you wanted to. The hassle would be the manual fetching and returning of the drive, but with low upload bandwidth, it might be the best option. As someone else suggested, Backblaze works well, but it really depends on your internet connection.\n", "Q: How to do SMC reset when keyboard is not working?

As per the documents this method is for notebooks with removable battery.If not then what are my options to reset the SMC without replacing the keyboard?\nPS: USB/Bluetooth Keyboards cannot reset the SMC.\n\nA: Yes, but in these models you technically don't need to press the power button for 5 seconds, although there's no reason not to. \nAssuming you have the correct tools you can remove the bottom case, disconnect the battery for a while, reconnect it and the SMC should be reset (assuming there's no other underlying problems such as a logic board fault).\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How do Wi-Fi networks persist between installs? I've just done a reinstall from the recovery partition and have found that all the previously known Wi-Fi networks have persisted, even though I formatted the main partition during the reinstall.\nHow are they still here?\n\nA: They are synchronised over iCloud, so if you log in to iCloud the list of networks and their associated passwords are added to macOS.\n", "Q: Flycut icon disappears when I open Word My Flycut clipboard icon in the top ribbon disappears when I open Word - the program where I most need it!

In these cases, regardless of the possibility that you have not balanced the record, a foundation errand or other program may do as such, and this overhaul could bring about the document vanishing from view.

We tried to edit the email HTML code in ~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData/Signatures but mail just either deletes it or completely ignores it even though we edited AccountsMap.plist and AllSignatures.plist with the correct data.

They can SUPPORT higher refresh rates. So you always have to look at the weakest link between 1) what your computer can display, 2) what your cord can transfer, 3) what your monitor can display. For example, as is likely the case for you, if your monitor supports 4K at 60Hz and your cord supports 4K at 60Hz but your computer can only output 4K at 30Hz, then your monitor will only display 4K at 30Hz.\nTL;DR: You'll only be able to see 4K at 30Hz.\n", "Q: What is the maximum RAM size for MacBook Pro Mid 2012?

I summarise this below:\nMacBook Pro (15\", Mid 2012)\nThis model has two memory slots capable of taking 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM memory chips. Officially (i.e. according to Apple) these models only support 8GB of RAM. However, real world tests have proven that they can actually support 16GB of RAM.\nSee these MacBook Pro: How to remove or install memory for instructions.\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15\", Mid 2012)\nThis model has no memory slots and came with either 8GB or 16GB of onboard memory installed. You cannot upgrade the memory on this model.\nMacBook Pro (13\", Mid 2012)\nThis model has two memory slots capable of taking 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM memory chips.

However, real world tests have proven that they can actually support 16GB of RAM.\nSee these MacBook Pro: How to remove or install memory for instructions.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The Mid 2012 MacBook Pro can support up to 16GB of RAM by using 2 8GB kits. Both the Retina and non-Retina models (mid 2012) support 16GB of RAM.\nPer EveryMac.com, you can have \nI have personally used the Kingston KVR16LS/8 modules many times with great results.\n\nSince, you said that you already upgraded your drive to an SSD, I assume you know how to remove the bottom cover to access the memory.\n\nA: I just recently visited an Apple Store in San Antonio to deal with my mid-2012 Retina version of the 15\" MacBook pro.  He said their Apple service center does not even sell RAM anymore for this model but he recommended Crucial and he said it will definitely support 16gb RAM.\n", "Q: Switching between one and two monitors When running my MBP, I attach an external monitor, a keyboard and trackpad to it so I have two separate desktops which are contiguous; like it's a \"fancy\" desktop. \nBack in the day on Mavericks, it behaved properly: when I unplugged the external monitor to, say, take the laptop into a meeting, it would just put all of the desktops separately on the built in display, roughly preserving which window stayed on which desktop so all you'd have to use was a run a restore tool like Display Maid to restore your window positions when you plug your external monitor back in. This was handy because you didn't have to manually clean up your desktop when done. \nNow, with El Cap, it would seem that when you unplug the external monitor, it used the monitor count of whichever screen had the most desktops and merges the windows from the two \"combined desktops\" into one desktop in a way that seemed to be random, which is clumsy. \nWorse, setting back Display Maid to restore the original configuration automatic doesn't work like it used to - previously it saved positions on all desktops in one action, but now it does it one screen at a time and forcing you restore eech desktop separately, which is tedious. It would seem that Display Maid is not great software anymore.\nIs there some other utility out there that must work better so you can restore how your windows and desktop setup was as it was before you unplugged the external monitor. Any ideas?\n\nA: I answered a very similar, though not a duplicate, question just the other day where the proposed solution would work for your as well.\nBasically, the product you are looking for is Stay.\n", "Q: Is there any app to clear cache on iOS? I've read that applications on iPhone create some service files that even after its removal still on your device. To clean up iPhone it's recommended to delete apps and then install them again. \nIs there any program that allows clearing cache without deleting apps?\n\nA: Try PhoneClean make sure you don't let it clear your music album covers. It gives different options to clear up space. Personally, I clean my stuff out myself using software such as iExplorer and iFunbox. Choice is yours. PhoneClean for simplicity, iExplorer for advanced features. \n", "Q: caffeinate under lion 10.7.4 today i'm trying to use the typical 'caffeinate -t 1000' on terminal and get this output:\nGabrieles-MacBook:~ black$ caffeinate -t 1000\n-bash: caffeinate: command not found\nSo i read the man page and i saw the path was /usr/bin/ and no binary of caffeinate there.\nWhat can i do?

I've tried adding up different portions of the vm_stat command to show app memory, but it doesn't seem to ever add up.\nI've also tried getting used memory by trying to figure up the used, but it always comes back with more memory usage than Activity Monitor reports.

The reason you needed multiple passes or even the DoD 7 pass secure erase was because with traditional hard drives (HDDs) the data was stored on magnetic platters which left a residual magnetic imprint even when wiped.  This is how COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) utilities like Disk Drill  software is able to reconstruct a drive. This is not the case with an SSD; nothing is magnetized.\nIn fact, it is recommended (read that to mean highly advised) that you don't do a secure erase because you would be shortening the life expectancy of your SSD due to the increased write operations.\nPer Apple:\n\nNote: With an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not\n  available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD\n  drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from\n  an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault encryption\n  when you start using your SSD drive.\n\nNow, if TRIM is enabled (and it should be if your Mac came with an SSD from the factory), it will handle the task of freeing up the blocks of data no longer in use making them available for immediate writing.\nRegular HDDs didn't do this.  When you deleted a file, it only deleted the pointer to the data, not the data itself.\n", "Q: DMG Equivalent on Windows I have a folder to distribute.

You'll also need to erase the Macintosh HD and perform a clean install.  Make sure you have proper User Data Backups from which to restore your Data before erasing the Macintosh HD.\nHave a look at Create a bootable installer for OS X. Excerpt show below:\n\nUse the 'createinstallmedia' command in Terminal\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Download the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer\n  will be in your Applications folder.\n  \n*Mount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a secondary internal partition.\n  \n*Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.\n  \n*Use the createinstallmedia command in Terminal to create the bootable installer. Examples of this command are in the next section.\n  For detailed usage instructions, make sure that the appropriate\n  Install OS X app is in your Applications folder, then enter one of the\n  following paths in Terminal:\n  \n  \n  Path for El Capitan:\n/Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\n\nExamples\nThis is the basic syntax of the command. Replace volumepath with\n  the path to your USB flash drive or other volume, and replace\n  installerpath with the path to the Install OS X app. \ncreateinstallmedia --volume volumepath --applicationpath installerpath\n\nThe following examples assume that the OS X installer is in your\n  Applications folder and the name of your USB flash drive or other\n  volume is MyVolume:\nExample for El Capitan:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\n\n", "Q: At the apple store, will they change the color of the front display from white to black? I have a new iphone 7 plus, in rose gold, which I realized had a white front display only when I got home.

I upgraded to latest version of iOS and link my debit card to apply pay a few days ago. After that I start receiving a very suspicious invite on my iPhone calendar. I ignored it and on advice from my friend, disabled \"Events found in apps\". However, 2 days later, when I wake up, I received the same event again, and most shockingly the phone was at the payment screen, waiting for me to authorise the payment of $19,99 through my thumbprint. Unfortunately I did not take a screenshot of this as I immediately turn off and on my phone to get rid of it.\nI checked both my gmail and yahoo mail accounts that are linked to my phone, including the spam folder, but did not find any suspicious email.\nI had contacted apple support, but they did not even know about the disable event found in apps feature. Really worried about the security of my phone now and thinking of deleting apple calendar or removing apple pay. Any advise will be appreciated.\n\n\n\n\nA: Part of the solution, which fights the consequences not the reason, is to create another iCloud calendar named, for instance, \"Spam\" and move scam event(s) there without accepting/declining it (them). Then just delete this \"Spam\" calendar choosing 'Do not notify' when asked.\nI think all this is due to hack of Yahoo mail when some people got access to many Yahoo addresses (about 500 million) and now they are sending those iCloud calendar scams.\n", "Q: Is there a common reason for a Macbook battery to disconnect from the logic board? I changed my Macbook Air's battery one month ago. It is a mid 2011, 11\".\nI've changed it for a cheap battery bought on Amazon :  \nIt worked fine for one week, then the battery started disconnecting on a regular basis from motherboard. The little connector from the battery to the board \"jumps\" pretty often from its place. I then can use the Mac only if plugged in (the battery icon has a little cross on it + message \"no battery available\"). Until I reopen it, and reconnect the battery. Pretty annoying.\nI wonder if it is more likely that :\n\n\n*\n\n*Shocks do that. Not very likely to me as I tried pulling on the connector with my finger to see if this can happen.\n\n*Some \"ejection system\" kicks my battery out. As if the system detected overheating or such thing and decided to eject the battery.\n\n*Any other reason ?\n\nA: It's option 3 - \"Other.\"  There are two possibilities for your battery becoming disconnected with your logic board and both have to do with the molex connector:\n\n\n*\n\n*The connector on your battery is broken/defective.  If this is the case, the warranty on the battery (provided you are still within the warranty) should get you a replacement and have this fixed.\n\n*The connector on your logic board is broken/defective.  If this is the case, the only surefire way to fix it is to have the connector replaced.  This will involve soldering of the logic board.\n\n\nIf repairing/replacing the logic board is out of the question and the everything works fine with the exception that the connector won't stay connected, you can secure it in place with some Kapton tape.  It won't be the most elegant solution, but for under $20 for the roll of tape, it's a much more cost effective solution.\n\nAs for your first two speculations...\n\n\n*\n\n*Shocks. The amount of destructive force your Macbook would have to go through to \"shock\" the connector out would destroy your Macbook completely.  \n\n*Ejection system.  You would see some sort of mechanism to do this.  If your MBA senses things are getting too hot, it shuts the computer down.  There's nothing in any computer that \"ejects\" connectors.\n", "Q: Cleaning the outside of an iMac with an electrostatic cloth Is it safe to clean the outside of an iMac (and in general, any computer, be it the tower or the display) with a Swiffer cloth? Also, is it necessary to unplug it for doing so?\nI've read that you're not supposed to clean the inside of a computer with them because they are electrostatic.\n\nA: Personally I would never use anything that can build up an electrostatic discharge around computers.\nWhile the power supply may be 240~120V AC nonetheless the internal component are running a 12V DC or less and at the point an electrostatic discharge occurs that causes a spark and you feel the discharge it's at ~1000V DC and more then enough to permanently damage the electronic components of a computer if discharged through. This is why we that work in the industry use electrostatic mats and wrist straps when working on computers.\nThrough my career I've witnessed many times a component getting zapped because proper electrostatic discharge precautions were not taken by some colleagues and many users. I too have zapped a thumb drive via electrostatic discharge accidentally touching the USB connector having just walked down a carpeted hallway in the winter time while in northern climates because I forgot to ground myself first before plugging in the drive. I felt and saw the discharge as I plugged in the drive. It was working two minutes earlier in the computer I properly removed it from.\nSo, even just wiping the outside can have potential if it can discharge while brushing over any of the ports.\nI recommend using microfiber cloths that have been dampened and wrung near dry so as not to have enough moisture to damage the computer too. I've been using microfiber cloths for more years then I can remember and have never damaged anything I've used them on.\nAdditionally, especially if in climates conducive to electrostatic discharge, take proper precautions and at a minimum, wear an electrostatic discharge strap making sure you've grounded out any built up charge before touching the computer and maintain that ground while touching the computer.\nBTW Sorry about the original answer, it was meant for a different question. :)\n", "Q: Open a link in new tab in Safari on macOS Sierra Before macOS Sierra I could open new link with command-click in Safari.

In 2009 Apple actually released five different MacBook Pro models. See below for the power adaptor used with each model:\nMacBook Pro 17\" early-2009 -\n(85W MagSafe Power Adapter)\nMacBook Pro 13\" mid-2009 -\n(60W MagSafe Power Adapter)\nMacBook Pro 15\" mid-2009 (2.53GHz model) -\n(60W MagSafe Power Adapter)\nMacBook Pro 15\" mid-2009 -\n(85W MagSafe Power Adapter)\nMacBook Pro 17\" early-2009 -\n(85W MagSafe Power Adapter)\nIn a nutshell, your 60W adapter will work with both the MacBook Pro 13\" mid-2009 and MacBook Pro 15\" mid-2009 (2.53GHz model) computers. It should not be used with the others!\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Hidden Documents folder after turning off iCloud Drive I recently tried iCloud Drive for syncing my Desktop and Documents folders. However, Documents was already being synced via Dropbox and I noticed that iCloud Drive and Dropbox don't get along. Seemingly random files inside Documents were copied over and over again for some reason.\nSo I decided to revert back to Dropbox and turn off iCloud sync. That worked fine on my iMac. However, doing the exact same thing on my MacBook Air made the Documents folder disappear. I quickly realized that it is only hidden (see screenshot), albeit without a preceding dot (.).

When I try to boot I get a startup chime as follows: 3 beeps followed by a 3 second break followed by 3 beeps and it just keeps looping in the same pattern. \nI did check this Apple Support page about startup tones, but my situation is not listed. It is very similar to the RAM failure tone, except that it's 3 second pauses for me not 5 as described by Apple. \nShould I assume that the 5 seconds is not literal and it is in fact a RAM problem? \n\nA: No, you cannot assume that. This repeating startup chime with the three second pause between the three tones is an indicator that you are trying to boot your iMac from a non-supported operating system.\nThe 27\" mid-2011 iMacs originally shipped with Mac OS X 10.6.6, and later shipped with Mac OS X 10.6.7. This iMac will not run from Mac OS X 10.6.5 or earlier. However, on the positive side, it will run all version since, including macOS Sierra.\nAs an aside, it is strange that Apple hasn't documented this on the page you referenced.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Can iTunes be loaded onto my iphone7?

I have an US App Store account from when they opened it, 2010 if I'm not mistaken ( I'm an early adopter :) ).\nBack then I used \"None\" as payment method when I created the account because I didn't have a credit card.  I used a fake US address, as I live in Asia.\nI've heard that you can do that, but if you buy In-App Purchases your account will disabled forever, because Apple allowed buying apps with gift cards abroad but doesn't allow buying any IAP from abroad.\nBut that was in 2010, what I want to ask is: are these restrictions true? Will Apple disable your account for buying IAP abroad?\n\nA: On the \"can you spend a Gift Card on In-App Purchase\" part, here's what Apple says:  \n\nYou can use store credit for purchases that you make in any of the stores or to pay for in-app purchases until it's gone.\n\nAs long as you keep using Gift Cards and don't run out of credit you should have no problem.\nIf you have or get a local credit card, and want to use it, you will have to either create another Apple ID to manage both stores, or switch to your local store and lose US store purchases, as you need your card and store country to match.\nAs Apple puts it:\n\nFor example, only German credit cards can be used to buy content from the German iTunes Store and App Store.\n\nThis articles 1, 2 take on the problems and advantages of having more than one Apple ID for purchases and describe what you do in extension.\n", "Q: Delay mounting Backup Plus drive after being improperly ejected I have a 1TB backup plus drive (Seagate) formatted using ExFAT, to be able to use it on Mac OS. I'm using an Early 2015 Macbook Pro Retina (13\"), running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.\nFrom when I first started using the hard drive, it works perfectly fine once it's mounted. When it has been ejected improperly (yes, I know, I shouldn't, but it happens by accident sometimes) it will take ages (+- 20min) after plugging it in again for it to mount (show up in Finder). I tried opening Disk Utility to check if it shows up there, it never does. The delay is always there. Disk Utility just shows a spinner and doesn't even load my main HDD, unless I plug out the external HDD.\nAlso tried various commands in the Terminal, e.g. diskutil mountDisk disk name and  diskutil mount volumeName, etc. Nothing seems to help, the delay is consistently there.\nAfter reboot, it always shows up immediately, which tells me it's not the disk's fault. \nAnyone have a solution to this? USB service restart or something like that?\n\nA: There's probably a duplicate question here, but the system will run a filesystem check when the device attached is possibly a foreign file system or a native Mac filesystem where the journaling feature is disabled or the journal indicates possible failures of the disk allocation catalog or directory structures.\nYou can usually open Activity Monitor and see some activity start when you connect the drive while the OS is checking if the drive is correct before showing it in finder. Depending on size of the volume, this could take 5 to 25 minutes or more if the drive itself has hardware malfunction.\nTo diagnose this, you would need a tool to disable the disk arbitration framework and then time / examine the mount process for each disk that's out of the ordinary.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Disable USB Auto-mount\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/531673/disable-auto-mounting-of-all-unknown-drives-on-os-x\n", "Q: How to use different versions of paraview python? Paraview comes with a python called pvpython that I wish to use from the command line. Currently I have version 4.4 installed and to make it available I have added the following into my ~/.bashrc file:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/bin/\nThis allows my to type pvpython at the command line. But I now want to upgrade my Paraview to version 5.0 but still retain the old version. What is the best way to do this? If I download the new version of paraview I just get a package manager that I think will overwrite my old version (I just have /Applications/paraview.app but no version!) - but I want to be able to switch between the two versions whenever I want! Any suggestions would be helpful!\n\nA: I would rename the old paraview.app to  paraview4.app and the new one to  paraview5.app.\nInstead of exporting a path, create two aliases in ~/.bash_profile (and/or ~/.bashrc - it depends on if one sources the other)\nalias pvpython4='/Applications/paraview4.app/Contents/bin/pvpython'\nalias pvpython5='/Applications/paraview5.app/Contents/bin/pvpython'\n\nIf pvpython4/5 rely on the paths to /Applications/paraview*.app/Contents/bin/ I would choose a function which sets the path and calls the right binary.\n", "Q: Apple Store - Mavericks/Yosemite Stuck at \"Downloading\" and actually does NOT continue to download? Good day everyone. I've been at a bit of a bind as of late. I was trying to download Mavericks/Yosemite off of the Apple Store. I open it up, log in, then go to the \"Purchased\" tab. I scroll down and download OS X Mavericks. A confirmation pop up opens:\n\nI then hit Continue to let it download through but I notice that it's just stuck at \"Downloading\", as seen in the screenshot below:\n\nIt has been sitting like that for roughly 5 minutes. Now, I don't know what to do and how to proceed. I've tried rebooting my laptop but that didn't do anything good, the same issue persisted. \nThis was the same case for Yosemite.\nAny help will be very much appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: Look at the Launchpad icon in the Dock.\nIf it's downloading there will be a thermometer [which I've since been informed is actually called a determinate progress bar] under it showing progress. \nBear in mind the download might be as much as 6GB, so 5 minutes isn't really much at all unless you have a really fast connection.\n\nIf you rebooted, dropping the connection, then you might have to poke at it a bit to get it going again. It ought to auto-resume, but sometimes gets stuck.\nIf it did, click Launchpad, find the partial download icon, then hold  Opt ⌥  & click the X in the top left corner.\nGo back to Purchased & start over.\n", "Q: How do I stop getting password notifications from iCloud?

The recommended Linux/Windows way is to use command line:\ncvlc --run-time=5 --sout file/ts:stream.mp4 htsp://@ip:5050\n\nI would like to do the same on OSX, but it doesn't have command line. I tried the same, but replaced cvlc with /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC, but it doesn't work:\nfilesystem access error: cannot open file /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/rtp://@ip:5050\n\n\nA: I would avoid VLC if you want to record streams off the Internet.  After many months of trying to figure it out, it came down to an issue with with their codec not working propertly via command line.\nHowever, because of this problem, I found a better solution (it works with audio and video):\nFFmpeg\nIt's a command line tool and is the source of the libraries that other app developers use (like Handbrake).  It's available as a source or binary - whichever you are more comfortable with (I personally recommend the binary).\nThe command to record a stream is is actually very simple:\nffmpeg INPUT [options] OUTPUT [options] \n\nFor example, if I wanted to record a streaming video for the next hour and place it on my Desktop:\nffmpeg http://foo.bar/stream -t 3600 ~/Desktop/foo_bar_stream_mp4\n\nFor more info, see the full documentation.\n\nA: Since Mac apps are actually packages (EG special kinds of folders filled with files) you need to specify the path to the actual executable within the package:\n/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC [options]\n\nYou may also wish to consult the VideoLAN Wiki for more references\n", "Q: How to check Raw Files in my iCloud Drive?

Open a Terminal window and enter the following:\nln -s ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents ~/Desktop/iCloud\\ Drive\nThis will place a symbolic link to your iCloud Drive on your desktop. You may move it wherever you please.\nStarting with El Capitan, trying to navigate to that folder using the  Cmd  ⌘Shift ⇧G shortcut takes you instead to ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs. Incidentally, that is the same location that the Favorites shortcut points to.\nDo note that opening most of these folders will take you to ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs. However, you can expand them to inspect their contents in List View.\nThis comes in handy when troubleshooting certain iCloud synchronization issues, such as (in my case), Text Replacements not making it to my Mac.\n", "Q: How to copy part of a text, iOS10 In iOS 10 Apple added the ability to react to messages (“tapback”). You can give a thumbs up, a heart, laughter, etc. You do so by tapping and holding the message and then tapping your reaction when the options pop up.\nBefore iOS 10, though, tapping and holding a message allowed you to select part of the message, just like tapping and holding text most anywhere else on the iPhone.\nIs it still possible to partially copy text from an iMessage or SMS? If yes, how do we do so?\n\nA: Best way is to select \"forward\" then you can select part of the message to copy. Apple should fix this though.\n\nA: In iOS 10, you can only copy an entire message. You may then edit it upon pasting.\nWhen the Tapback options show up after long-pressing a message, you get the option to Copy at the bottom of the screen.\n\nTapping More… lets you select multiple messages to Delete or Forward.\n\nA: No, it's not possible with a non-jailbroken iOS 10.  You can select the entire message to copy first and then after you paste you can edit the text.\n\nA: Easiest solution I found was to copy the entire bubble, then paste it into the text area to send, and in that area you can select just the single word or portion you want like normal text.  Once selected and copied, just delete the message and don't send it.\n", "Q: Add printer on El Capitan I am trying to add HP P1606DN as a USB printer. The instructions from HP say to use Apple Update via the Printers & Scanners dialog: HP Printers - Installing a Mac Printer Driver Using Apple Software Update.  \nHowever  nothing shows up in that dialog. \n\nSo then what is the correct procedure to download/install printer drivers known /recognized by El Capitan ?\nBtw here is the Printers and Scanners after tryng both (a) Apple update and (b) manually installing the HP printer software. In both cases the new printer does not appear\nUpdate the HP printer is giving a dialog \"The disk you inserted was not readable by the computer\". So maybe this were a case of a problem specific to the printer.\n\nBut the thing is - the HP installation info directs us to use Apple Update. So feels like we were going in circles here.\n\nA: HP has its drivers readily available on its website. Just google the name of the printer.\nThat led me to this link. Which seems to have the driver you need.\nApple Software Update does not always have the driver you need. It has gotten so that any time I install an HP printer I just google the name for the latest driver as the CD that comes with most printers is Windows only or out of date. Also they often install a bunch of crap advertising HP supplies.\n\nA: It appears that USB Printing for Mac from this printer simply does not work.  IP printing otoh is working fine.\nThe printer has a button to depress for several seconds and then prints the configuration page.  If that trusty rj45 were plugged in then an IP address will be showing up.  OS/X has no problem whatsoever with finding the IP enabled printer.\n\nA: Have you tried opening App Store with the printer connected? I had a similar issue that was solved by downloading HP Drivers Update.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra frequent internal error After upgrading to macOS Sierra (version 10.12), I frequently get the following

That cannot be changed.\nYou can assign both Ringtones and Alert Tones to any event under Settings → Sounds & Haptics on your iOS device.\nAs far as app-specific limitations are concerned, you’ll have to take it up to the developers of such apps, in this case WhatsApp. I doubt Apple will add that functionality, since it makes no difference to iOS itself.\n", "Q: Is there a sandboxing program like Sandboxie for Mac? With Sandboxie for Windows, you are able to run applications that you don't entirely trust in a sandbox; it tracks all files the program creates and modifies, and although the files technically go to the system, you can roll back the changes by deleting this sandbox. This removes all the files created by the program and restores modified files to their previous state. In a way, it's like a system restore when you restore the system to a previous point; in this case, it would only restore the files that the program in question affected, so is much easier to use. At least, that's how I understand it works.\nOn macOS, there are three(ish) ways to do this I know of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a Time Machine backup, and then install the program. After using it, restore from the backup and everything will come out intact as it was before.\n\n*Use a VM to run it in; however, I'd like to avoid doing this as it complicates matters greatly\n\n*Use AppCleaner to remove files the program left behind. However, this doesn't do anything for files the program (perhaps maliciously?) modified, and if you install a program with administrative privileges or a package, it most likely will install files in the system that AppCleaner won't be able to get out. Also, I'm not sure if it is 100% accurate for normal apps, anyway.\n\n\nSo is there any way to do this on a Mac without using a VM?\n\nA: Well, there is this app - https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/19025/sandbox\nSandbox, But I am not sure if this works well with the latest edition. As such all the apps need to be sandboxed according to enhanced security measures, but this only applies to APPS on the Mac Store, but not for all the other apps not on the store!\n\nA: MacOS has a build in Sandbox feature which may help you but does not exactly have the same functionality as Sandboxy.\nThis Paolo Fabio Zaino's Blog post from 2015 explains how to run Applications in a Mac OS X sandbox. He summarizes it this way:\n\nby using sandboxing, you can restrict access an application can have to operating system resources like filesystem or network etc…\n\nQuoting his Blog Post:\n\nHow to sandbox an application?\nFirst of all, to let Mac OS X to know which resources your application\n  requires to being able to run properly we need to create a sandbox\n  configuration file. This activity will require some time and testing\n  because each application has different requirements\nHere is an example (change MyApp with your application name):\n;; This is my first sandbox configuration file!\n(version 1) \n(deny default)\n\n;; Let's allow file read and write in specific locations and not \n;; all over my filesystem!\n;; Please note you can add more (regex \"^/Users/user_name/xxxxxxxxxxx\") lines depending \n;; on what your MyApp needs to function properly.\n(allow file-write* file-read-data file-read-metadata\n  (regex \"^/Users/user_name/[Directories it requires to write and read from]\")\n  (regex \"^/Applications/MyApp.app\")\n  (regex \"^(/private)?/tmp/\"))\n\n;; You can also add a sperate section for reading and writing files outside your\n;; user_name account directory.\n(allow file-read-data file-read-metadata\n  (regex \"^/dev/autofs.*\")\n  (regex \"^/System/Library\")\n  (regex \"^/Applications/MyApp.app\")\n  (regex \"^/usr/lib\")\n  (regex \"^/var\")\n  (regex \"^/Users/user_name\"))\n\n;; If your MyApp requires to access sysctl (in read)\n(allow mach* sysctl-read)\n\n;; If you want to import extra rules from \n;; an existing sandbox configuration file: \n(import \"/usr/share/sandbox/bsd.sb\")\n\n;; If you want to decide in which filesystem paths \n;; MyApp is forbidden to write:\n(deny file-write-data\n   (regex #\"^(/private)?/etc/localtime$\"\n     #\"^/usr/share/nls/\"\n   #\"^/usr/share/zoneinfo/\"))\n\n;; If your MyApp wants to run extra processes it's be allowed to run only\n;; child processes and nothign else\n(allow process-exec \n  (regex \"^/Applications/MyApp.app\"))\n\n;; If your MyApp requires network access you can grant it here:\n(allow network*)\n\nOnce we have done with our sandbox configuration file for our\n  application, we can simply execute it using the following command from\n  the command line:\nsandbox-exec -f myapp-sandbox-conf /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp-bin\n\nWhere myapp is the name of the application you want to run in a\n  sandbox.\nIf my generic sandbox file will be too generic for you and you want\n  more practical examples (already implemented) then run your terminal\n  application and have a look to all the examples already kindly\n  provided by Apple:\nls /usr/share/sandbox\n\nIn this directory you’ll find plenty of files like\nsshd.sb\n\nTo look into and have more insight/tutorial to write your own sandbox\n  configuration file for your specific application.\n\n", "Q: icdd process consuming substantial memory on macOS In the past week or so the process 'icdd' has been starting from time to time and when it does it consumes massive amount of RAM (upwards of 7 GB). When this happens, my MacBook Pro essentially becomes non-functional until I can open the Activity Monitor and force-kill the process. \nI've attached a screenshot of the activity monitor showing icdd using over 7GB of RAM and making the memory pressure skyrocket. \n\nDoes anyone know what this process is or how I can prevent this issue from occurring every 30 minutes or so?\n\nA: I have been working with a senior technical advisor at Apple on this issue for over a year, and was working with another senior advisor for some time before that.  We have done \"data capture\" to send to Apple Engineers on several occasions and done screen recordings on several occasions to demonstrate what is going on in Activity Monitor, Image Capture, and, ultimately, in a plist that icdd maintains at /Users/user_name/Library/Application Support/icdd/deviceInfoCache.plist (by displaying it in Xcode).\nAt this point, here is my best estimate of what is happening:\nThe icdd (Image Capture Device Database) process sees scanners come and go on a busy network.  It attempts to keep a list of their icon files in a hash table, which it also writes to the deviceInfoCache.plist file mentioned above.  Yes - this sounds crazy - it is keeping references to the scanners' icon files.  But even crazier is that, for some reason, almost all of the entries in this file point to .icns files that do not exist.  Of several systems I've looked at, there have been many thousands of entries in the file, yet only a few of the .icns files existed on one of the machines, and none existed on the others.  I believe that when this file gets large, icdd is spending a lot of time trying to check for the existence of entries in the .plist file and modify the file.  I believe this for two reasons.  First, when I take my laptop home, the icdd process sometimes continues to run at about 100% of a CPU, but when I then kill it, it goes back to the \"normal\" approximately 0.0 to 0.1%, every time.  Hence, I think it is sometimes still trying to process information about the entries when I open it up at home.  But when I kill it while on the busy network, it often comes back at near 100% right away.  When the number of scanners shown in Image Capture goes down (which it often does, but will periodically spike for some reason), icdd will eventually settle down.  And second, deleting the deviceInfoCache.plist file causes icdd to behave reasonably for a short while - until the number of entries builds up again.  Note that icdd maintains a copy of these entries in memory, so if you delete the file from the user account, icdd just rewrites it immediately.  And, of course, you can't kill icdd long enough to delete the file, so you have to log out and delete the file from another administrator account via the terminal.  icdd will recreate the file when you log back in, but it will have relatively few entries and behave well for a while.  \nTo give some idea of scales, Apple Engineers were shocked to see that I had as many as 85 scanners displaying in Image Capture.  Often, however, this number will settle down to about 6 on the same system and during the same timeframes.  The deviceInfoCache.plist file has had between 8,000 and 12,600 entries on the systems that I've looked at that have had icdd problems - mine is the larger one, and I believe this got carried over from an older machine since I was having icdd issues from the time I set up my new MacBook Pro in 2016-Dec.  When I deleted the plist file, the number of initial entries in the newly created file was 44, and for a few days icdd cpu usage hovered close to 0.0%.  However, after about 5 days on campus, my plist file has 964 entires, and icdd cpu usage will routinely bounce between 30% and 90% on the busy network at the university.  When I am at home, the plist file will only increase its number of entries by 0 to 2 over the course of a day.  Of the 12,600 entries in my previous plist file, only 2 of them contain a \"deviceName\", the rest contain an \"iconPathLocation\", all of which point to nonexistent .icns files.  With the current plist, there are still exactly 2 entries that contain a \"deviceName\", and the rest contain an \"iconPathLocation\" that does not exist.\nSo, the short-term solution is to delete the plist file from another administrator account via terminal while logged out from your user account.  Hopefully, with this information now being provided to Apple Engineers from my Senior Advisor, Apple Engineers will have enough information to figure out why icdd is acting this way and fix the problem.  Of course, it would probably help if you can verify my short-term solution and continue reporting what you find to Apple.\n\nA: I have been dealing with this problem for a while and have been checking everywhere! It is frustrating ... Finally I found a link that I could stop this stupid madness. I am not sure if this is the source of the problem but it could stop it. Here are the steps:\n\n1) disable SIP (link)\n2) type the following commands:\n\ncd /Applications\nsudo mv Image\\ Capture.app/ Disable\\ Image\\ Capture.app/\ncd /System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Support/\nsudo mv icdd icdd-disable\n\n3) reboot\n4) enable SIP if you care\n\nOriginal link:\nhttps://havecamerawilltravel.com/photographer/prevent-photos-app-mac-osx\nHopefully it helps.\n\nA: I've been struggling with this problem as well. Not finding answers online and not wanting to mess with terminal, I called Apple Support. Initially, they thought my HD was corrupted (it was - that was fixed but did not fix the problem). The problem persisted after increasing my RAM. Prompted by an internet comment regarding network scanner searches, I noticed that ICDD would only get crazy when Wi-Fi was enabled. If I disconnected from wi-Fi and quit ICDD, it would not restart and climb in RAM or CPU usage (until Wi-Fi reenabled).\nI called Apple Support again who seem to have fixed the problem by resetting SMC and NVRAM. Now ICDD runs at a low level (10-20 MB) rather than consuming 10+ GB of RAM. I've added links below for doing those, but I'd recommend calling Apple Support for your specific problem.\nTheir explanation for why this is happening had to do with my RAM being clogged or full with internet caches, etc. Why it has just now become apparent and whether it is associated with Sierra, I cannot say.\nI hope this helps some people!\nReset SMC: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201295\nReset NVRAM: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204063\n10-15mins fix.\nMy specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*early 2011 13\" MacBook Pro\n\n*500 GB Samsung SSD (upgraded ~1.5 yr ago)\n\n*8 GB RAM (upgraded ~1 month ago)\n\n*macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (up to \n\n*Parallels 10 with Windows 10 for SAS software\n\n\nA: While the above answers provide better technical data, I'd like to add a general note.\nWhat we're dealing with is probably a lousy piece of software, that carries old bugs for years, that was not tested properly, and will probably never get fixed. That's all. In the last decade Apple software engineering is deteriorating in a constant way, and we have to put up with such scenarios all the time.\nUsually resetting such software pieces to their original state (say, by deleting caches and setting files, .plists or even resetting their user-defaults) would ease the problem for some time. \nAnother way is to reset the OS related subsystem. In this case for example,  will let you \"reset the printing system\", which will probably clear icdd's head for a while - but will force you to setup your printing environment again.\nAnd of course, opening new RADR entries to Apple may eventually get their attention to the faulty subsystem.\n", "Q: Missing Photos choice in 10.12 Screensaver I recently updated to 10.12 Sierra and migrated iPhoto to Photos. In System Preferences I do not see a choice to select Photo library. In the source panel I just see National Geographic/Aerial/Cosmos/Nature patterns. I would like my photos to be my screensaver.\nAny help?\n\nA: I have just spotted an older (2012) answer at this link:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20120112094116261\nHowever it suggests clicking and holding the \"Screensaver\" tab, which didn't work for me.  But clicking and holding the \"Source\" drop-down menu button did work for me - up comes an option to use \"Photos\" but if you choose that, you can then choose between the \"Photos\" app and \"iPhoto\" app. This is a better solution than the one I just posted, I think.\n\nA: Try this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Decide which iPhoto library you want to use, and open a finder window with the iPhoto library icon showing.\n\n*Hold down the Control key and click the iPhoto library icon.  You should see a drop down menu including an option \"Show package contents\".\n\n*Select the folder \"Masters\" or \"Previews\" (both seem to produce the desired effect - I suspect \"Previews\" has the edited images, but we'll need an expert to answer that).\n\n*Create an alias.\nYou can do this three ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*with the folder selected, click \"File\" in the Finder menu bar and select \"Make alias\", or use the shortcut \"Cmd/L\".  Then drag the alias out of the \"Package contents\" window - to the desktop for example or your \"Pictures\" folder.\n\n*You can also hold down \"Alt\" and \"Cmd\" and drag the folder you want -  this will create an alias as you drag, indicated by a little curvy arrow on the icon you are dragging.  Right, now go to System Preferences/Desktop & Screensaver, select the \"Screensaver\" tab, and use the \"Source\" drop-down menu that appears just under the \"Preview\" box on the right, selecting the option \"Choose folder\".  Use it to navigate to the alias that you have just created.  This works for me under OS 10.12.1 (Sierra).\n\n\n", "Q: Change location of screenshots mac Right now they default to desktop, and I followed instructions found here. It works up until I shut down the computer; I was wondering if there was a permanent solution?\n\nA: Terminal command to change screenshot save location: \ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location \"/path/to/new/location\"\n\nPut your desired screenshot path between the double quotes as it is required if any spaces exist in the location path! Locations without a space will still be executed properly.\nExample path with a space in new path: \ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location \"/Users/YourUserHomeFolder/Pictures/Screen Shots\"\n\nSo no one is confused, the ~ character is a shortcut character symbol for your user's home folder. Other answers/sites might use this symbol.\nExample:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location \"~/Pictures/Screen Shots\"\n\nThe above defaults command will change the location screenshots are saved. The only problem is the path location must always be available or else it'll default back to the Desktop.\nExample scenario: If you set the path to a removable volume such as a flash drive at /Volume/USBFlashDrive and remove it, or the location for some reason becomes unavailable from perhaps deleting, it'll revert back to its default location.\nThe only thing you'll need to change is the /path/to/new/location. This can be found from Finder by right clicking on your chosen folder. Then, after the context menu appears, hold the option key to change Copy \"...\" to Copy \"...\" as Pathname, so you can paste it into Terminal as the replacement for the example path provided above.\n\nA: *\n\n*First of all you should make new folder somewhere on your Mac. for example: Screenshots folder on Desktop.\n\n*Open the Terminal application on your Mac. Copy and paste this command to the Terminal window and press Enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/screenshots/\n\n(However, If you wish to save screenshots in downloads folder the path looks this way: ~/Downloads/screenshots)\n\n*Then paste this command to save changes and Press enter see immediate effect. \nkillall SystemUIServer\n\n\n*Now use Cmd + Shift + 3 (eventually 4) shortcut, you will see your screenshots are saved in your new location.\n\nA: Found this tutorial from Google.com\nBy that, just create a new folder somewhere else where you want to store screenshot. For example, Desktop -> Screenshots\nThen perform this command in Terminal.\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/username/Desktop/Screenshots\n\n", "Q: iMac Internal Hard Drive Not Visible, Won't Mount; Currently running off External Drive My iMac (27-inch, mid-2010) crashed and refused to reboot.

Can I delete a pkg dmg zip file after I install its content? I mean if this is a little app can I delete the installation file without breaking the installed application?\n\nA: To answer your question(s), generally speaking, yes, you can delete the container file whether it be a .pkg, .dmg or .zip file. This of course assumes that all content of the container file has been installed. In other words, some .dmg files might contain extras in a separate folder within that are not installed when you drag and drop the app into Applications.\nSo use common sense when making the decision to delete the container. Obviously if the container contains a single file and you install it, then there is no need to retain it if you don't mind downloading again if for some reason it's needed again.\n\nA: The answer is yes. You can delete the .pkg/.dmg/.zip file after installing the app. It will not affect the app as both files are different. These packages are just containers.\n\nA: Take care that some installers (.pkg files) may also contain a menu/button for properly uninstalling the app. Browse the app's doc to see if this is mentioned. If so, it is a good idea to keep the .pkg file somewhere (external drive, ..)\n\nA: Yes, it's no longer required to run the application so it's safe to delete.

I did not encounter about an shortcut for this command and I did not see any property in Automator app. If is it possible, it will be nice improvement for productivity when we working with tabs rather than windows.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open  → System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts.\n\n*Click the + to add a new shortcut.\n\n*Choose All Applications from the Application dropdown.\n\n*As the Menu Title, enter Merge All Windows (*see note at the bottom).\n\n*Input a key combination of your choice as the Keyboard Shortcut. I use Ctrl ^W.\n\n\nNow all applications with a menu item called Merge All Windows will respond to that key combination, and collapse all your windows into one.\nStarting with Sierra, it is also possible to open documents in new tabs rather than in new windows. This is enabled by going into  → System Preferences → Dock and setting Prefer tabs when opening documents to Always.\nIf you would like new Terminal sessions to open as new tabs as well, you can achieve this by placing a file named .bashrc in ~ (your Home folder), with the following line in it:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to click menu item \"Merge All Windows\" of menu \"Window\" of menu bar 1 of process \"Terminal\"' >/dev/null 2>&1\nNote: Merge All Windows may differ based on your operating system's language.

For a list of mail commands, see man mail.\nYou should be getting mail with an error message something to the effect of:\n/bin/sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `\"'\n/bin/sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file\n\nAs for you command and why it's not working, it's because the \"%\" sign is a \"newline\" character, meaning that it tells the shell to \"go to the next line.\"  So, after it encounters the first \"%\" it goes to the next line and it never sees the rest of the command.  This is confirmed by the \"unexpected EOF while looking for the matching ' \"  '(double quote).\nThe local man page for crontab (man crontab)is quite sparce with details and I am speculating it's because cron has been deprecated for launchd1.  However, the crontab manpage from developer.apple.com explains it \n\nThe \"sixth\" field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be\n  run.  The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or % character, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in the SHELL variable of the cronfile.  Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will be sent to the command as standard input.  The command can optionally be prefixed by \"@AppleNotOnBattery\" to tell cron not to run the command when functioning on battery power.  For example, the \"sixth\" field when using this option would appear something like \"@AppleNotOnBattery /usr/bin/touch /tmp/foo\"\n\n\nYour fix:\nSo, what you need to do, is \"escape\" the \"%\" character with a backslash (\\) so that it tells it to interpret it literally.  \nYour command should be:\n0/5 * * * * /bin/date \"+\\%Y-\\%m-\\%d \\%H:\\%M:\\%S\" >> /tmp/log.txt\n\n\n1 From man crontab:  (Darwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are officially supported under Darwin, their functionality has been absorbed into launchd(8), which provides a more flexible way of automatically executing commands.  See launchctl(1) for more information.)\n", "Q: How to verify if pmset works correctly?

Please make a comment if there is extra privacy against invites from people not in your contacts (I thought it worth making an answer for this, given that information still seems to leak).\nI tried the accepted answer: sent an invite to my iCloud account from a different iCloud event and followed the accepted answer. The sending account saw the event as declined. It's not clear whether spammers can see this using their method but it's definitely possible that they can.\nI also tried moving the invite into a Junk calendar without deleting it and even this action can be seen - the inviter sees something like \"Deleted from Home\".\n\nA: I've had the exact same email. I've managed to get rid of it by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new iCloud calendar - I called mine junk\n\n*Move the spam invite to the new Junk calendar\n\n*Delete the newly created Junk calendar with the spam appointment in it - ensuring you select the 'Delete and Don't Notify' option in the Dialog box that appears.\n\n\nThis worked for me - I hope it works for you too.\n\nA: With regard to #2 (how to delete without sending a notification to the sender) -- I don't have an answer yet, but I can confirm that the up-voted answer from Jackal above (\"move spam event into temporary calendar, then delete temporary calendar\") still sends a DECLINE to the sender.\nUnderstandably many folks here and in other social media venues that are sharing the workaround have merely trusted the \"Delete and Don't Notify\" button on the calendar-with-open-invites-delete warning to do what it says it does.\nThis, however, is Stack, where we should promote testability, repeatability and empirical evidence in general.\nThis is simply tested and currently repeatable on latest build of macOS and Calendar at this time of writing: simply have another iCloud user send you an invite, and have them watch your acceptance-status change from NO REPLY to DECLINED, the moment you click \"Delete and Don't Notify\" on for that temporary calendar.\nSo far, @AppleSupport has yet to respond with anything except \"PM us with your device and OS versions.\"\nIn the meantime, I have 5 spam invites filling my calendar that I'm not touching.\nAnd no, I am not interested in turning OFF the direct-from-email-to-calendar feature, as it is a good feature, it just needs \"show invites in calendar automatically, but only for senders in my contacts\" and a \"swipe-left-to-delete-the-invite\" ... and then actually NOT send a decline.\n\nA: Apple made a 'report junk' button inside the calendar app on iCloud.com - when you report an invite it will be deleted across all synced calendars.\n\nIf you get an invitation that you think is junk or spam, you can\n  report it to iCloud.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID, then click Calendar.\n  \n*Open the event you want to report, then click Report Junk.\n  \n*Click OK.\n  \n  \n  The event is automatically deleted from your calendar on all your\n  devices where you’re signed in with the same Apple ID.\n\n\n", "Q: Game sounds won't play on iPhone 6 I have an iPhone 6 with up to date software.

The application in question is called Pomodoro One. It does not have built-in Applescript support, so I want to create a script that clicks on its menu bar and presses \"Start Pomodoro\".\nAfter hours of research on the Internet and experimentation with Script Editor, plus the creation of a visual automation with Automator, I have come up with this script that SHOULD work:\ntell application \"Pomodoro One\"\n    activate\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell UI element \"Pomodoro One\"\n        tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n            click menu item 1 of menu 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nHowever, it does not work. Surprising, especially since the the automation in Automator works and this script is basically a paraphrasing of the Applescript that Automator converts its visual automation into. This is the error that I get, both from ScriptEditor as well as running the Applescript in Automator:\nSystem Events got an error: Can’t get menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of UI element \"Pomodoro One\". Invalid index.\n\nWhat I think is happening is that when Applescript attempts to click on menu bar 2 (which represents the menulet), the menu that is supposed to appear does not. As if the click is totally not happening. However, I am indeed able to click on menu bar 1 (which represents Pomodoro One's main menu bar). This is stumping why clicking on menu bar 2 yields nothing, especially since UI debugging apps like UI Browser indeed report that the menulet is represented by menu bar 2 when I do visual profiling of the UI.\nI am hours into this and I feel very stuck. I am wondering if there is any way that I can get Applescript to play nice with the menulet of any third party applicaton.\nEDIT\nBased on this post (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20595708/applescript-to-click-on-a-specific-icon-in-the-mac-menu-bar), I modified my script to be the following:\nignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Pomodoro One\"\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n    end tell\nend ignoring\ndo shell script \"killall System\\\\ Events\"\ndelay 0.1\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Pomodoro One\"\n    tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n        click menu item \"Start Pomodoro\" of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis time, it results in the script infinitely spinning and eventually timing out with error -1712: System Events got an error: AppleEvent timed out. I can assure you that I have accessibility enabled, via System Preferences --> Security and Privacy --> Accessibility for both Pomodoro One and Script Editor.\n\nA: I encountered the same problem (the script infinitely spinning) in macOS Sierra.

Hence, Activity monitor is showing some data transfer over some sort of internal network, and this is now what I am interested in. \nI would like to use some tool (also from command line) that only shows the data exchanged by applications over the external network (either ethernet or wifi). Could you recommend such application? \n\nA: You can see the total number of bytes transferred per network interface using:\nnetstat -ib\n\nor for an individual network interface (e.g., en1) using:\nnetstat -b -I en1\n\nYou can monitor the amount of data per program using:\nnettop -P -t external\n\nThe \"-t external\" includes only external traffic.\nYou may be interested in the amount of traffic per web page.  If you are using Safari, then select >Develop >Open Web Inspector, and select the \"Network\" tab.  This will show which files are transferred and the total size of the web site.  Unfortunately, it counts cached files in the page size, so it does not truly reflect the amount of data transferred.

I need to download audio records from dictaphone/recorder to my desktop/PC (not Mac). \n\nI connected the iPad to my PC using USB cable. Through my PC I started browsing it. I cannot see audio files. I can see only DCIM folder and PNG and JPG pictures in it.\nI tried to send them from iPad to my email. But these audio files as attachment are not sending. They are too big for sending via email. \nI don't have iTunes on my PC. So I can't use it.\n\nQuestion: how can I download audio records from the iPad? \n\nA: Considering you talking about Windows when you say PC.\nWindows itself can NOT access applications data folder, if you dont install any software on Windows you just can't access those files directly. \nMaybe you can send them via e-mail, WhatsApp, (whatever, something via internet), but, it depends if your app has this feature.

The command diskutil eraseDisk is not what I want because that wipes the entire disk. I have a partition already allocated and it is blank. All I need to do is format it with VFAT/FAT32. How can this be done from Terminal? It must the same effect as using mkfs.vfat on Linux.\n\nA: The command is newfs_msdos.\nAlso for HFS+, the command is newfs_hfs.\nUse man newfs_msdos or man newfs_hfs for more information.\nGenerally, you would use diskutil list to get the slice (identifier).\nNext you use diskutil unmount identifier, followed by the format command.\nFinally, use diskutil mount identifier.\nFor example.\ndiskutil list\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk0s4\nnewfs_msdos -F 32 -v BOOTCAMP /dev/disk0s4\ndiskutil mount /dev/disk0s4\n\nNote: Using diskutil to format a partition (slice) can have the side effect of altering the type of partitioning a drive is using.\nFor example, the command\ndiskutil eraseVolume fat32 BOOTCAMP /dev/disk0s4\n\ncan result in changing a GPT partitioned disk into a hybrid GPT/MBR partitioned disk.\n\nA: Enter diskutil list to get the disk identifier/partition. Then enter:\ndiskutil eraseVolume FAT32 DATA diskXsY #replace diskXsY by the proper disk identifier\n\nDATA will be the name of the volume. The name has to be capitalized using diskutil ....\n\nThe diskutil eraseVolume ... command will change the pMBR of the GUID partition table to a hybrid MBR and probably renders an existing OS X system volume on the same drive unbootable.\n", "Q: IOS developement I am considering IOS devices to be used for a customized application for a small population of users.

Ultimately, I am trying to decide if it worth dealing with any hurdles or I might be just better off using Android platforms\nExamples of hurdles include $100 license / fee to create apps and requirement to have MAC \\ OSX ($600) minimum \n\nA: An Enterprise Developer License costs $299/year, and allows you to create apps for IOS and Mac for distribution within your organisation (you can't put apps signed with the Enterprise Dev License onto the app store). While it's possible to use the test devices allowance of a standard developer license to distribute your app to a small number of devices (from memory you can have 100 test devices), managing this is likely to become tiresome quite rapidly, and an extra $200 should be easily findable if your business has the need for custom apps and the necessary resources to acquire sufficient IOS devices for your users.\nThere are a number of low-cost mechanisms you could use to distribute your private apps -- Xcode server, manually adding the app to devices or via a web service such as Diawi. Obviously you could also invest in an MDM platform but given the nature of your question that seems unlikely.\n", "Q: Can any recent iPhone benefit from the AirPods instant pairing?

I do have a rather large disk (2TB OWC Aura SSD), so I decided to give it some time … but it's pretty clear at this point that nothing is happening. (I'm also afraid to stop it; because last time I gave up on it, it took a solid hour to ‘remove created partitions.’ Took nearly as long to un-do, as I'd given it to do. :P)\nTo be clear, the download phase completed; it's stuck at the ‘Saving’ phase. Unlike old-school Boot Camp, I can't just uncheck the option and download the drivers manually; it forces me to go through this step.\nSo, tl;dr: Is there any way to skip the ‘downloading and saving drivers’ steps, or use pre-existing install media, or otherwise get Boot Camp working on a MacPro6,1, or \"2013 Mac Pro\"?\nMac-side: macOS Sierra 10.12\nWindows-side: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.14393\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Older Boot Camp, and current Boot Camp on some machines, gives you a list of checkboxes to decide what you want it to do.

When I was stuck at that exact phase, after giving it a good thirty minutes or so at 100% bar fill, I simply ignored it and went ahead and restarted my computer and it starts on windows. I don't know why this happens or why this works but it did... give it a shot\n\nA: Open the disc you are saving the drivers to, notice the bootcamp folder. Inspect the contents and whilst refreshing see if the size of the most recent .exe is increasing or static. if increasing, let it wait and if static and has been for a little while, then it has completed or indeed stalled. \n\nA: It's not much of an answer, so apologies if you come across via Google - but after sitting incomplete for something like two days, power to the workstation got cut; and it rebooted into Windows.\nIt's not precisely what worked for me, but if this happens to you, perhaps try killing the Boot Camp Assistant, so it doesn't have an opportunity to undo its work? Despite the ignoble end to its efforts, the resulting Windows indeed opened up to the installer, so it seems to have worked.\n", "Q: How to schedule VLC recording with cron?

I originally asked this question which never got an answer beyond the fact that you apparently can't do this on a Mac.  So finally I've given up and have fired up my Windows gaming box just for this purpose.\nNow I can run VeraCrypt (a TrueCrypt fork) and use it's \"Portable Mode\", but I can't for the life of me actually get it to work such that I have an encrypted partition that can be opened on both Windows and OSX.  And the docs basically assume everything \"just works\" and haven't proven to be very helpful.\nAt the moment I have created a USB stick with a very small unencrypted FAT partition which can be seen by the Mac, and a FAT VeraCrypt encrypted partition which can be seen on Windows and the mac.  It mounts fine with the password on Windows, however when I run VeraCrypt on the Mac and try to mount it, I'm met with an error:\nVeraCrypt requires OSXFUSE 2.3 or later with MacFUSE compatibility layer installer.\nPlease ensure that you have selected this compatibility layer during OSXFUSE installation.\n\nSome googling on that error message has just left me more confused.\nGiven that I'm running OSX Mavericks, and this image must be accessible to both Windows (versions >= XP preferably) and OSX (Mavericks or higher) without installing anything special (stock OS in other words), what do I need to do to get this to work?\nNote also that I don't care about hiding the fact that VeraCrypt is being used, and I will not upgrade from Mavericks.

I would run the package contained inside but would get the error during the installation:\n\n\"OS X El Capitan Update can't be installed on this disk. This volume does not meet the requirements for this update.\"\n\nWhat must I do to get my Early 2009 iMac updated? \n(I am still learning about Macintosh computers.)\n\nA: I'm not sure what's going on with the App Store update, but I have a guess about the downloaded update: did you get the \"OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 Update\" (759.1 MB), or the OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 Combo Update (1.5GB)? If you downloaded the first one, it won't work because it's only capable of updating from 10.11.5 to 10.11.6; since you have 10.11.2, you need the \"combo\" version, which rolls in all of the earlier 10.11.x updates, and is therefore capable of updating from any earlier version of 10.11 to 10.11.6.\n(BTW, this requirement is listed on the download pages for the two updates, but you have to click \"System Requirements\" to actually see it, and even then it's not very explicit.

This changed in macOS Sierra. Now when I press those buttons, it will create a new window.\nIs there a new shortcut to select the address?\n–––\nEdit:\nOk, I think I found the issue: the standard keyboard I work on is Dvorak - QWERTY.\nIt means the keys are in the Dvorak layout when I type normally, and they become QWERTY when I press the command button. I use this because many shortcuts are in favour of the QWERTY Layout.\nI confirmed on another keyboard that selecting the address bar is still indeed Command+L. The reason Safari would open a new window instead is because the \"L\" button in QWERTY is \"N\" in Dvorak layout. Command+N is open a new window! It would mean that in macOS Sierra, pressing the command button does not always turn the layout in QWERTY, and sometimes it inputs the key value in Dvorak even if I press down the command button... How do I fix this issue?\n\nA: Check Safari menu that you have the same picture as below.\nIf anything is different then you need to check System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts to see if you have any other keys assigned to these menu items.\n\n", "Q: Retrieve hard drive information from dead Macbook Pro I have spilled a little bit of water around my Macbook Pro and some if obviously got into the computer because it won't turn on anymore -- force booting it gives me the flashing \"? folder\" thing. \nSo what I was wondering/hoping/praying is that someone knew a way that I can retrieve the info from a 2015 15' Macbook Pro's hard drive in any way.

Apple's instructions are here: https://support.apple.com/kb/ph10725?locale=en_US It's the same procedure across all recent OS versions.\nOtherwise, you need something like this to pull our the M2 SSD, and turn it into a standard desktop external drive: https://www.amazon.com/ZTC-Enclosure-Adapter-SuperSpeed-ZTC-EN004-BK/dp/B00KQ4LNJC or https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-M-2-SATA-External-Enclosure/dp/B00T8F298Y\nGoes without saying though, if the drive is broken, doesn't what you or how you plug it in - it's broken.\nFurther reading: http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/macbook-pro-retina-display-faq/macbook-pro-retina-display-how-to-upgrade-ssd-storage.html\n", "Q: Eclipse 'luna' installing issues on MacOs Sierra 10.12 im getting issues while installing eclipse luna for MacOS Sierra 10.12\nI have followed the procedure for the installing the eclipse.\n1.Download the eclipse luna.\n2.move the zipped folder to desktop.\n3.extract the zipped file.\n4.move eclipse icon from desktop to the applications folder.\n5.when I double click the eclipse icon, it gives the following error.\nbelow is the screenshots attached, can anybody help me with the solution.\nError - \" Eclipse quit unexpectedly- Click Reopen to open the application again.

Questions about Gmail will have better (and non-off-topic) answers there.\nThe problem with this solution is that you won't get notified.\nI can think of two ways to get actual notifications from those specific search terms: filter everything that does not match the criteria out of the inbox, so you'll only get notifications from incoming mail that matches, or adding an IFTTT recipe that notifies you when the criteria is fulfilled —this looks promising:\n\nI'd go with \"New email in inbox from search\" trigger and then enter your search terms. Here is a guide from Google on search operators that allow you to construct a custom search, OR probably, but you'll have to experiment the search syntax that gives you the desired result.\n", "Q: rEFInd boot macOS from Recovery HD fails.

For reasons past comprehension, the new iOS 10 Messages app allows applying \"effects\" to messages. It used to be possible to disable the ability to generate or receive these abominations by choosing\n\nSettings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion\n\nbut since 10.1, this now appears to be impossible.\nHow do I disable sending or receiving \"effects\" in iOS 10.1 Messages?\n\nA: Apple added a new setting to disable playing message effects.  Go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Reduce Motion and turn off Auto-play Message Effects.\n\n\nA: With regards to your answer, I feel that most people who were searching this question were having a problem when they attempted to SEND a text message.  I discovered that with the Message program, that when you select the option to send new message, and the cursor goes to the \"To:\" field, when the person begins to type in the contact's name, and they select the name, the Message program does not default to the mobile number as the option to send it to, and the sender is not realizing that there is a small spinning wheel of death next to the name if you just select it there.  This is where I also was having the trouble.  When you typed in the message and selected the Green SEND arrow, the program was sending us to a screen where it was asking us what text effect WE were wanting to send the message with, and then still not sending it.\nThis is what everyone out there was running into and not getting the correct answer to.\nWhat the sender needs to do is when they begin to type in the name of the person that they want to send the message to, and see the name come up on their screen in the list, they need to click on the \">\" arrow that is at the right hand side of the list.  The contact will then expand for that person.  At this point you will select the specific number or email address that you are going to send the message to, and this will then allow you to send the composed message.\nI was having this difficulty with the new company phone that I was just issued, and for some reason the settings on some of our phones were set like this, causing this problem for many of us.\nIf you would please share this information, I believe it will help a lot of users out there.\nW.

We had to update our install scripts to copy the file a different way.\n\nA: in my case there was some process called syspolicy or something like that, once i killed that process, running my command python3 no longer returned killed 9.\n\nA: I was able to fix it after running this command found in this homebrew github discussion:\nbrew reinstall pcre2 gettext\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How can I sync old messages between iDevices? Recently Messages stopped working on my Mac. Messages sent by my iPad and iPhone were synced to my Mac, but sending failed. After trying about twenty-eleven possible solutions from here, apple, and elsewhere on the internet, I rebooted my Mac.  This doesn't happen often.  The problem went away, but so did the last 2 months worth of messages.\nIs there a way to sync past messages between multiple devices?\nIphone/ipad are on iOS 10, Mac is on Yosemite.\n\nA: Generally speaking, the answer is no. Messages are saved on Apple's servers for up to 30 days, but only if the message has not been confirmed as received by the device. Even if it was still on the server, there's no way to get the server to resend it to your device. Nor is there a way to sync messages between devices.\nYou could save Messages history off your iPhone with something like iExplorer, but there's no way to integrate that into the Messages app on your Mac.\nAs far as them disappearing when you rebooted, under Messages > Preferences ensure \"Save history when conversations are closed\" is enabled.\n\nA: The easiest way would be to use iCloud.  I have it on all of my devices and it works flawlessly across an iPad, iPhone, MBP and Mini(Server).  You may need to pay for additional storage because mail counts against your iCloud storage limit.\n", "Q: Can I use SIPS to reduce the size of PNG files by reducing the number of palette colors?

I'm hoping someone here can tell me what's wrong with it. \nThe feed is http://www.loatoday.net/feed/mp3/\nIt validates correctly at validator.w3.org/feed\nIt validates correctly at castfeedvalidator.com\nIt validates correctly at www.feedvalidator.org\nIt even passes validation at podcastsconnect.apple.com/#/new-feed\nThe only possible problem I can find is a warning message that states, \"line 1, column 38: Use of unknown namespace: http://podlove.org/simple-chapters\"\nI've checked with the developer of the WordPress plugin (Podlove Podcast Publisher), but they claim that this shouldn't be a problem and that all of the other podcasts using their plugin (they have more than 2000 installs) work just fine in iTunes.\nI've asked for help at discussions.apple.com and the resident iTunes help expert (Roger Wilmut1) at that site says he can't find anything wrong with it either.\nI've tried writing to PodcastSupport@apple.com for their assistance on two different occasions over the past 8 days, but so far I have received no reply from there, either.\nThe error email I receive doesn't really help either. It says: \"An error was encountered while trying to add your feed.\"\nThat's all it says about the error. Then it gives me links to standard podcast resources.\nI'm at a loss what to do next. Can anyone here tell me why Apple keeps rejecting my podcast feed submission?\nADDITIONAL EDIT: Just for the heck of it, I tried commenting out the namespace that the validators didn't like. It validated again, this time without incident, in all four places, but submitting the podcast resulted in the same, non-descript error email.\nAny help anyone can give would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Well, it looks like the problem may have been related to http vs https.\nI found this interesting note on Apple's \"Podcast best practices\" page at https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itc2b3780e76\n\"Pick a reliable podcast host and be sure to host podcast episodes, artwork, and XML on an HTTPS-authenticated server.

This time, I got an email back saying, \"Your podcast feed, [ https://www.loatoday.net/feed/mp3/ ] was successfully added and is now under review.\"\nThis is particularly weird because Roger Wilmut1 over at discussions.apple.com told me that Apple used to refuse https feeds. So apparently this is a change they instituted sometime in the past year or two. Maybe it is an outgrowth of the Apple vs FBI controversy over the terrorist's iPhone earlier this year?

After another reboot returns to original behavior.\nBoot from USB memory (with MacOS Sierra install): boot menu appears, and allows me to select the USB memory stick for booting, after starting boot process from memory, returns to original behavior (note that I used same memory stick to load MacOS Sierra onto a Mac Mini with no problems)\nRemoved Hard Drive completely (and attempted to boot from USB memory): symptoms unchanged\nReplaced internal memory: symptoms unchanged\nAttempted boot with charger unplugged: symptoms unchanged\nQuestion:\nSo, I'm thinking that, if it is not the  \n\n\n*\n\n*Hard drive, or\n\n*Memory, or\n\n*Power Supply\n\n\n...then it must be the motherboard that is bad.  Before I make that definitive conclusion, I'm wondering if there are any other ideas that I might try?\nP.S.\nOn a side note that might be more relevant than I think, I noticed that this model is one of the models potentially implicated in the MacBook solder scandal (see https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/ which lists the 15\" Early 2011 model as one of the model lines with problems).  The symptoms don't exactly match what is listed there.  I haven't noticed any video problems (except for when I was changing out the memory: I got a couple of strange all-blue screens, but that could just be a result of poorly seated memory).  However, is it possible that a failing video adapter could cause problems at boot time?\n\nA: Try Resetting the  SMC (if you haven't already, and see if that changes any of the mentioned behaviors)\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the Mac.\n\n*Plug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your Mac.\n\n*Using the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time.\n\n*Release all keys, then press the power button again to turn on your Mac.\n\n\nThe SMC or System Management Controller can require a reset and exhibit similar symptoms when malfunctioning. If this doesn't help, I can only suggest there may be hardware damage somewhere or possibly latent water damage side effects manifesting themselves. \n\nA: This might be a hardware problem, especially with the hard drive.\nHence, I suggest this procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unscrew the bottom cover\n\n*Carefully extract the hard drive\n\n*Insert the hard drive in an SATA to USB converter\n\n*Check the hard drive condition of the hard drive from a Windows PC, using HD Sentinel or HD Tune trial version. Check if there are warnings, especially \"Reallocated sector counts\", which would be an indicator of bad sectors.\n\n\nIf the are no warnings in  the S.M.A.R.T. values, you can perform a more thorough scan of all sectors using HD Tune.\n\nA: I'm having trouble remembering exactly which computer this was, but I am 99% sure it turned out to be a bad video card - one of the recalled models.\nTo make matters worse, the local Authorized Mac Resellers (this was in a country that does not have official Apple stores) refused to repair it, even under the recall notice, until finally the recall period had expired.\nI think the local store eventually tried baking the motherboard, for a charge, which then resulted in more damage.\nAnyway, as I've heard, Apple was just swapping out the bad parts with similar parts with the exact same fault that would eventually fail again.

I recently added/updated some pictures for my contacts within the built-in phone app. Gmail now somehow has those pictures, 1) how is this possible? 2) How do I limit Gmail's access to my contacts info/pics?\nI am running an IPhone 7 with the current iOS. I do have the gmail app installed, but it does not have permission to access my contacts AFAIK. The settings for my gmail account within the built-in mail app has Mail, Contacts, Calendar all set to enabled. My understanding of that contacts slider switch is a \"one-way\" deal. My phone has access to my gmail contacts not the other way around, but maybe that understanding is flawed. 3) Is my understanding on this matter correct?\nI greatly appreciate input from anyone with direct knowledge on what controls directly pertain to gmail's access to my phones contact pictures.\n\nA: Your phone and your Gmail contacts get synced, which means if you change a contact on your phone, it will change on your Gmail contacts too, and vice-versa. It is not a one-way deal.\nTo limit Gmail access, you will have to disable contacts sync entirely with Gmail(using the slider) in the settings app.\nYour contacts include pictures as information which is part of the contact, and Gmail syncs the entire contact, so there is no way to block Gmail from accessing your contact photos.\n\nA: Enabling Contacts for a particular account (such as Gmail) syncs contacts on the device with that account.\nYou can choose to disable Contacts for that account and it should prompt you as to whether you want to keep contacts on the device or delete them. However, there is no way that I'm aware of to have one-way contact sync like you describe.\n\nA: Go to Settings/Privacy/Contacts and switch the slider next to gmail from \"on\" (green) to \"off\" (plain white).\n", "Q: Yet Another \"Will This CPU Work?\" - Mid 2011 iMac 27\" Upgrade The system I started with:\nMid 2011 iMac 27\"\n\n| Memory    | 8GB 1333MHz DDR3                 |\n| HDD       | 2.7GHz 1TB (7200 rpm)            |\n| Graphics  | 2.7GHz AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512MB |\n| Processor | Intel Core i5 2.7GHz             |\n\nThe system I currently have (only changes listed):\n| Memory | 32GB 1333MHz DDR3                              |\n| HDD    | 4.0TB (5900 rpm) SSHD Solid State Hybrid Drive |\n\n(Memory is OWC Memory Upgrade)\n(HDD is From Seagate)\nThe System I want\n| SSD       | 120GB 6G SSD Optical Bay Hard Drive Replacement     |\n| Graphics  | Mid 2011 iMac 27\" Radeon HD 6970M 2Gb Graphics Card |\n| Processor | ...?                                                |\n\n(SSD is OWC 120GB SSD)\nI'm not as impressed with the HDD as I thought I would be. It is way better, but it is also way more than I need. I have just under 40GB of consumed storage on my system (i.e. currently 3.96TB available), so with the 120GB I can make a 60GB partition for the entire system (startup, apps, files), and another 60GB partition for another drive (storage, OS, whatever). The 4TB HDD will be for deep storage, should I ever need it.\nI am confident the GPU upgrade will work. Apple also has technical specs stating that the graphics are \"Configurable to AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 2GB GDDR5\".\nStuck!\nThe processor is where I'm having trouble. Hardware is not my schtick, and there are endless feeds talking about various processors, and whether or not they work.\nOne person might say that \"You can only use an i7 core Apple offers as a OEM upgrade or you'll have firmware problems.\"\nAnother person might say that \"they're using a \"regluar i7-2600\" and having no problems.\nAnd finally, another peron might say that the \"Core i7-2700k (3.5ghz)\" will work fine in the 2011 iMac.\nBut which is it!? Will any old processor do?\nMy Research\nAbout all I know with processors is they need to have the same socket (for this iMac, it is LGA 1155), and compatible RAM ((for this iMac, it is 1333MHz DDR3).\nFrom there, I've narrowed it down to five Intel Core i7 Processors (all five compared on same page after links):\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel® Core™ i7-2600 Processor (8M Cache, up to 3.80 GHz)\n\n*Intel® Core™ i7-2600K Processor (8M Cache, up to 3.80 GHz)\n\n*Intel® Core™ i7-2700K Processor (8M Cache, up to 3.90 GHz)\n\n*Intel® Core™ i7-3770 Processor (8M Cache, up to 3.90 GHz)\n\n*Intel® Core™ i7-3770K Processor (8M Cache, up to 3.90 GHz)\n... Here is a one-page comparison of all five ...\nBut from here, I really don't know what any of it means. Bigger numbers often mean better (more cores, higher processor frequency, more memory, faster speeds, etc), but this isn't always the case.\nThey are all within 0.2GHz, which is hardly noticeable or worth splitting hairs over. Same number of cores. Same cache. Same max memory. Same package (ignoring FCLGA1155 from LGA1155). And the rest is basically identical between them, with the occasional differences that I likely don't understand.\nOne standout difference for the 3770 series are that they both have lower Thermal Design Power, which will help with internal cooling and fan noise. BUT, the same series is also the only one without Intel Fast Memory Access, which sounds pretty great!\nOn top of not being able to adequately differentiate them, I wouldn't know if any of these processors is/is not compatible with the graphics card and other components I've set up, or if they'll sun with my current OS.\nJust to recap, the hardware:\n| Memory   | 32GB 1333MHz DDR3                   |\n| HDD      | 4.0TB SSHD Solid State Hybrid Drive |\n| Graphics | Radeon HD 6970M 2Gb Graphics Card   |\n| SSD      | 120GB 6G SSD                        |\n|          |                                     |\n| OS       | macOS Sierra (10.12.1)              |\n\nI've read multiple successes for getting non-Apple processors to work by deleting AppleHWSensor.kext. Maybe this won't even be required.\nCan You Help Me?\n\n\n*\n\n*Can any one of these processors be used for my upgrade? Thus making the real deciding factor the features, cost and availability?\n\n*Or are only some of them suitable candidates? Which ones? Why?\n\n*If the first is true (any will work), is any particular processor more renowned than the others? I'm trying to stay away from opinions for this question, but maybe one or two of them are known to be industry go-to.\nThe End\n\nA: \n1. How to choose a compatible CPU?\nThe basic rule is to use what Apple uses in different iMac models:\nAs shown above, these are the five CPUs that iMac 2011 uses in different models.\nAccording to your question, your current CPU is Core i5-2500S@2.7Ghz.\nSo, in order to prevent possible compatibility problems, we have three options: (In Socket1155 CPU)\n\n\n*\n\n*i5-2400@3.1Ghz\n\n*i7-2600S@2.8Ghz\n\n*i7-2600@3.4Ghz\nPerfomance: i7-2600 > i7-2600S > i5-2400. So is the price,\nand they are all more powerful than your current i5-2400S.\nSuggestion:\nNow as you want an upgrade, i7-2600S is the best choice in both relatively lower price and enhanced performance.\n2. Why not use CPU with \"K\"?\nFirst:\nK represents \"unlocked\" and \"Overclock\", which enhances the performance of CPU and requires motherboard support as well. I think you don't have the need to overclock CPU.\nSecond:  find some questions on changing CPUs with K processors, some of these questions report system problems.\n3. How to really boost your system?\nChanging the CPU might matter. But as I have been using both i7-2600 and i7-3770,\nI cannot tell their difference when using iMac except that you have tasks bringing heavy load on CPU.\nChanging to the SSD is what can really boost your system.\nActually, poor speed of regular HDD is the cause of poor system performance.\n", "Q: How to display google calendar \"reminders\" on macOS calendar app?

I clicked the restart button, but on reboot rather than starting to encrypt the disk it simply displayed the prohibited sign. Now I can't boot to my Sierra drive in single-user mode either. \nMy Recovery paritions (one for Sierra and one from an older El Capitan install whose main partition no longer exists) are both displaying the same issue, no booting to recovery in general or in safe mode. I need help, I had a lot of code store on the Sierra partition, but I never made backups of some of it, and the backups I have are several weeks old. I don't have the recovery key, it is in a file on the now dysfunctional recovery disk, so I need to know, is there any way to salvage the install from a macOS install usb? \nIf so is Mavericks a new enough version to do so from? Can I simply decrypt my Sierra partition from inside of it or would I require at least a Sierra installer to do so, and if I can't decrypt it from an installer, would it be safe to install Mavericks over Sierra, or to a different disk, extract my personal/company projects from it and simply re-upgrade once I had it working again in general. Again I need help, and I would rather not have to wipe and lose all of that data.\nUPDATE: It seems the Mavericks installer can't load drivers on boot, and I don't know of another way to access the filesystem. If it turned out the disk didn't get encrypted would it be possible to boot a live copy of linux, mount the disk and disable FileVault from there? If so how would I disable FileVault?\n\nA: First if all, thanks to @klanomath or I likely would still be assuming the wrong issue. He was correct that the data was never actually encrypted due to FileVault's incompatibility with CloverUEFI. I used a Mavericks install USB, and used Terminal from inside it to confirm that the data was not encrypted, followed by using the \"Turn Off Encryption...\" option for the disk in disk utility, and immediately rebooting after double checking that the disk was not actually actively decrypting. \nI now have access to my Sierra install again, and will shortly test my Sierra and El Capitan recovery partitions to see if they are working.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra Preview Extra Services When I highlight text and right click, I usually get this menu: \nNotice at the bottom where I have custom services such as \"Custom Text To Speech\" and \"Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track\".

I read this post, but it doesn't answer my question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to paste multiple email addresss into iPhone mail To: field?\nI have noticed that it seems to be possible to include a name along with an email address, even for names/emails that are not in my address book.  After the email is sent, looking at the header shows blue bubbles with the correct name for each email address.\nHowever, when I try to paste multiple email addresses along with names, I can't tell what Mail.app is going to do with them.  It doesn't turn them into the blue bubbles that make it intuitive.  (It seems to only do this after the email is sent.)\nExample of the format I'm talking about:\nJoe Blow joe@blow.com\nJimmy Dean jimmy@dean.com\nSally May sally@may.com\n\nBy contrast, when a list formatted like the following is pasted into a recipient field, all the email addresses immediately turn into individual blue boxes that indicate how Mail.app will separate them:\njoe@blow.com,jimmy@dean.com,sally@may.com\n\nPossibly related; when I saved a draft that included multiple email addresses in the BCC field formatted like this, and opened the draft later, I found all but two emails (out of about fifteen) had disappeared from the BCC field.\nIs there a correct standard format for pasting multiple names and email addresses into a recipient field?  (Not names from the address book.)\nIf so, what is it?\n\nA: The expected format for multiple e-mail address is:\nJoe Blow <joe@blow.com>\nJimmy Dean <jimmy@dean.com>\nSally May <sally@may.com>\n\nCopying and pasting this into Mail.app on macOS 10.12 works as expected.

I updated to 10.12.1 and now the MBP gets stuck booting at the screen with the Apple logo with the progress bar at 100%. \nI have already tried recovery mode with first aid disk repair, but the MBP gets stuck booting afterwards as well. \nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: my MBP is a Mid-2012 Retina, and I have had this issue with both the HP Printer Update 5.0 and 5.1. I successfully ignored the update for a while, but tried today and ended up with the same problem. Here's a step-by-step fix that helped me get back on the road:\nThe Fix (if this sounds scary, don't do it - find someone who is comfortable with  this process to help you):\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the power button until your machine shuts off.\n\n*Hold the 'command' and 'R' keys simultaneously, then start your machine. Wait\nfor the chimes before you let go. \n\n*You will boot into the recovery partition. \n\n*Open the 'terminal' application (hint: it's in a menu)\n\n*cd /Volumes/'your volume name here'/Library/Extensions (to figure out your volume name, type 'cd /Volumes', then type 'ls' to see the list of available volumes. The one you want to use is the one you normally boot into. \n\n*type 'ls - l' when you are in the Extensions directory of your boot Volume, and confirm that you see the directory 'hp_io_enabler.kext' \n\n*type 'rm -rf hp_io_enabler.kext' this will recursively delete the directory and all contents. the f means 'force'. \n\n*if you like, type 'ls -l' to confirm that the 'lil guy is gone. \n\n*quit the Terminal and reboot your machine to the normal Startup.\n\n*get on with your life!\n\n\nTo hide specific updates in Sierra, right-click (Command click) on the specific update, and select the convenient 'Hide Update' that appears. How easy is that?\n\nA: The problem was a kernel extension that prevented the boot. In my case it was hpioenabler. After removing it I was able to boot. \n", "Q: Upgrade to macOS Sierra Will my data on the Macbook Pro be destroyed if I upgrade to macOS Sierra from OS X El Capitan?\n\nA: It will most likely all be there.

Ok, let's first check the caps lock key. It's off. Searching for a solution on the web I find this, and try cmd+R and everything else.

The hint is now present, but the password is unbelievably still refused!\nEDIT:\nI see a dot for each key I press, so it's out of question that some key doesn't work at all (it could work unproperly, thus giving wrong output..). Furthermore I followed the instruction of the video I linked, so I had to write resetpassword, which proves that the keyboard is detected as QWERT‌​Y, and not AZERT‌​Y, for example.\n\nA: In the end I found no reasonable answer to my question. So I decided to set the password (with the method mentioned in the question) to void. Then when the mac is boot the password in no more asked, thus solving the problem.\n\nA: Thanks for the post.  Just discovered an old iMac which had exactly the same issues as (very nicely) described by yourself.\nI think the issue was to do with the update removing wifi connection passwords rather than anything else.  If you CMD+R and enter the recovery mode, you can click on the wifi icon and re-enter the wifi connection password.

I've tried applications Renamer and NameChanger, the latter which supports regex, but I'm stuck. Lord this is frustrating...please help and many thanks to you in advance for the dear soul to lend the solution! \n\nA: I'm not familiar with either of the programs you've tried, but here's how to do it in A Better Finder Rename ($20), and I expect at least one of yours can do it in a very similar manner. See below the screenshot for instructions and an explanation.\n\nFirst, I chose ABFR's \"Re-arrange using regular expressions\" feature. This will probably be named something similar in other programs. This requires a regular expression to match with, followed by a substitution pattern to create the new filename.\n(.*)_(\\d{3})\\.mp4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The first capture group (.*) simply matches any number * of any character . necessary to make the filename match.\n\n*This is followed by a literal underscore, which in your case delimits the border between the filename and number.\n\n*Then, the second capture group (\\d{3}) matches exactly three {3} digits \\d. If some of the files have more or fewer than three digits, say a number between n and x, you would change it to (\\d{n,x}).\n\n*Finally, the extension is matched with an escaped period \\. and mp4. If your files have different extensions, you should change this to \\.(\\w{3}) — just like the number, but with characters \\w instead of digits.\n\n\nThen, we use those capture groups to make the new filename. The syntax for this part may vary more between programs.\n$2_$1.mp4\n\nThis is perhaps more straightforward: our second set of parentheses surrounded the number, so we put that first with $2, followed by an underscore, the filename $1, and the extension .mp4. (If you used \\.(\\w{3}) earlier, write $2_$1.$3 instead.)\nIf you'd like practice and help with writing regular expressions, I recommend the website RegExr, which provides live syntax highlighting and tooltips.\n", "Q: What is Notes.app's iCloud notes database location(s) for recovery (El Capitan)? I lost a note from the Notes.app and need to recover it. I have the entire content of my HD backed up (both online and with TimeMachine) so I thought it'd be easy. However, I can't find up-to-date information on where notes are stored on current installations of El Capitan. \nIt seems that notes are no longer stored in either\n/Users/yourUserName/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes or\n/Users/yourUserName/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes\nwhich is what other threads on this site and elsewhere claim. (See here. I also tried the solution suggested here but it did not work for me.) Maybe this behavior changed in the meanwhile. \nI have checked the versioning entries of the databases in both of these locations an they all didn't get updated since May. \nAnyone out there who knows where notes are stored on current installations of El Capitan?  What folder to replace to get them back?  \nAny help much appreciated!\nNote:\n– I am referring to an \"iCloud\" note that I need to recover, not the \"On My Mac\" note.  I do not use \"On My Mac\" notes.\n– My iCloud notes get synced with my iPad too, but it is not available anymore under \"recently deleted notes\".  I also looked on icloud.com but to no avail.\n– When I opened the Notes.app on the iPad that particular note was still visible on the screen as I had been working on it (I had not opened the app on the iPad for a month). After it refreshed the note was gone. \nEDIT (after a few more unsuccessful attempts):\nSince it seems that when iCloud is disabled Notes won't read any \"iCloud\" notes (which is logical ...) the best strategy would be to close the Notes.app, then download a past version of whatever that magic folder is that holds the current iCloud notes, cap the Internet connection, replace the current notes folder with the backup and then start Notes again, copy the missing note somewhere else, and then reestablish the Internet connection.\nBut I'd need to know what that magic folder is on El Capitan ... anyone any ideas?  \nEDIT2:\nCould it be that Notes stores \"iCloud\" and \"On my Mac\" notes in different places? Via this script I was able to extract the content from the backup of the NotesV6.storedata database within com.apple.Notes, but the missing note did not show up. It seems the notes contained in that database were either even older than May, or they were \"On my mac\" notes, from some time before. I had moved all my notes to iCloud earlier this year (but before May) so I think the NotesV6.storedata database in com.apple.Notes might contain the on my mac notes.\nNow group.com.apple.Notes was also changed last time in May but I have a slight hope that if those are the iCloud notes, some version of that note was already there.  But the data there seems to be stored in a different format, there is no NotesV6.storedata file, and so the script mentioned also did not work.  Any ideas?  \nI'd highly appreciate any hints what I might try and where I might look!\n\nA: This is not a direct answer to the question \"What is Notes.app's iCloud notes database location(s)\" but it might be useful information for others who need to recover an iCloud-synchronized note. \nGiven my lack of success with everything I tried I called Apple support. They were very helpful and after a few unsuccessful attempts replacing folders they looked into my iCloud account and found that on their end there was \"one recoverable item\" that showed up. After verifying my identity they could then \"recover\" that item and, voila, the missing note popped up in the notes app under Recently deleted items. It had been deleted beginning of September. Had I only known it was that easy ...\nSo it seems that deleted iCloud notes are not permanently deleted after 30 days and still recoverable by Apple. I forgot to ask if forever, or for how long ... \nIn any case, while I've resolved my problem I'd still be interested in the actual location of the iCloud-notes database. So if anyone comes across this at some point and finds the answer it'd be highly appreciated. \n", "Q: Backing up iOS Health Data takes enormous space?

I know about Terminal commands how to show hidden files and hide files. However, I need a tool to make this task faster and easier. \nI was trying to find a special app in the App Store, but found nothing. Is there any way to show/hide hidden files without launching Terminal? Any tips or apps?  \n\nA: Since Sierra this is no longer necessary - see the answer by Olgab\nI just realised I've already posted this before - with instructions on how to persuade the use of  Cmd ⌘   H , which otherwise is used for 'Hide frontmost app'\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/177138/85275\nThis version has a fuller explanation of precisely how to create the service, so I'll leave it in, with the link.\nYou could write an Applescript, place it in an Automator Service, then trigger it by Key Command...\nThe following will toggle the hidden state with each trigger of the hot key\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator [Applications/Utilities]\n\n*Select New Service\n\n*In the Actions list on the left, Select Automator, then Run Applescript from the 2nd column.\n\n*Copy/Paste the script [full text at the end of this answer]\nMake sure you don't get the on run/end run section twice when pasting.\n\n*Save [It will automatically save to the correct place for Services.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services.

Prior OSes, you could refresh the views.\n\nA: On MacOS Sierra you can use shift ⇧ + cmd ⌘ + . shortcut on keyboard to toggle between 2 states. No need for any plugin/app. It works out of the box.\nYou can see it here in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdLjJU_kAT8&feature=youtu.be\n\nA: I like Tetsujin's approach. In fact, it's a shame most Mac users never familiarise themselves with AppleScript and Automator.\nHowever, if you're after an off-the-shelf solution you can opt for Onyx. Onyx is a powerful tool that can perform a lot of functions. It is free to use and no registration is necessary.\nIn particular reference to your question, to hide/unhide hidden files and folders, go to the Parameters page, select the Finder tab and check/uncheck the relevant option. See screenshot below:\n\nNOTE: \nI have no affiliation with the Onyx product.\n\nA: You can easily create your own app for this using  Platypus. Just replace evince with the commands for hiding/showing hidden files. The appropriate commands can be found here.\n\nA: You can try the long way to show hidden Mac OS X files is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal found in Finder > Applications > Utilities\n\n*In Terminal, paste the following: defaults write com.apple.finder\nAppleShowAllFiles YES\n\n*Press return\n\n*Hold the ‘Option/alt’ key, then right click on the Finder icon in\nthe dock and click Relaunch.\n\n\nThis will show all hidden files. To hide them again, follow the same steps but replace the Terminal command with:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO\nIt’s not the longest set of instructions or the biggest command to commit to memory but if you’re doing this a lot, it’s worth spending a few minutes now to save yourself a lot more time in the future.\n\nA: \"invisible\" is a free app in appstore that I am using to see the hidden files on my mac. It works actually great for me. Why not give it a try?\n", "Q: Does anyone know how iOS Safari 9 handles page crashes or freezing? We have a web app which is freezing in Safari 9 and Safari 10 on iOS 9 and 10. Worth noting this is a web page which is touch responsive, the users then add this web page to the Home screen of the device by opening the page in Safari and clicking 'Add to Home Screen'. \nThe app seems to sometimes freeze in Safari 9 and Safari 10, and no buttons are clickable. From what I can see the actual device seems to lock up and freeze sometimes but recovers after 1 or 2 seconds, I've tested this by looking through the recent apps, and this seems to freeze, this is happening on multiple devices and we have a theory it could be due to a third party app causing the devices to freeze.\nMy theory is that when the actual device (iOS) is freezing for 1 or 2 seconds, that the device is trying to unfreeze itself and it kills all the scripts running in Safari which is causing our application not to recover from the freeze, does anyone know if this is how Safari actually works? Or if this theory is possible?\nThank you! :-)\n\nA: Apple engineers wrote the code, but it's not available for inspection so the larger context is yes there is a system but we don't get to see it.\nYou can look at the logs an iOS device generates by plugging it into Xcode on a Mac or the Apple Configurator. If you do that, you will see that when an application crashes entirely - there will be a log file (that optionally is sent to Apple) explaining what crashed on a technical level.\nThe second level of logging is when an app (Safari in this case) burns too much CPU. This is likely what you want - when a web page has excessive javascript, buggy javascript, continual tracking and acts more like a program than a short document to be rendered once - you will get a spin dump that again is mostly engineering data - but you will know the OS noticed the app was nor behaving like a short, quick efficient worker. The have spin in the file names.\nLastly, you can avail yourself of the well documented and very powerful Safari development tools by enabling debug and inspecting what Safari is doing on an extremely granular level to include errors, warnings, code inspection, timing to the millisecond, etc...\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/\n", "Q: /bin/bash not executing any commands I set /bin/bash as my default shell like this:\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nBut it doesn't work when I open a new terminal tab.

When invoked as an interactive login shell, or a non-\n   interactive shell with the --login option, it first attempts to read and  execute  commands  from  /etc/profile  and\n   ~/.profile,  in that order.  The --noprofile option may be used to inhibit this behavior.  When invoked as an inter-\n   active shell with the name sh, bash looks for the variable ENV, expands its value if it is  defined,  and  uses  the\n   expanded  value as the name of a file to read and execute.  Since a shell invoked as sh does not attempt to read and\n   execute commands from any other startup files, the --rcfile option has no effect.  A non-interactive  shell  invoked\n   with the name sh does not attempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked as sh, bash enters posix mode after\n   the startup files are read.\n\nA new terminal session in OS X/macOS always starts as a login shell.\n\nA: To get /bin/sh to execute ~/.bashrc the same way /bin/bash does, you would have to do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the following lines to ~/.profile.\nLOGINSHELL=YES\nexport ENV=~/.shrc\n\n\n*Create the file ~/.shrc containing the following line.\nif [ \"$LOGINSHELL\" != \"YES\" ]; then  source ~/.bashrc; fi\n\nTo help in debugging, I usually add the following line to beginning of the ~/.profile file. \nexport DEBUGSHELL=YES\n\nThis line can be commented out when done debugging, as shown below.\n#export DEBUGSHELL=YES\n\nNext, add conditional echo statements to the beginning and ending of the files such as ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.shrc and others. For example, ~/.shrc would contain the following.\nif [ \"$DEBUGSHELL\" = \"YES\" ]; then echo entered .shrc; fi\nif [ \"$LOGINSHELL\" != \"YES\" ]; then  source ~/.bashrc; fi\nif [ \"$DEBUGSHELL\" = \"YES\" ]; then echo exited .shrc; fi\n\nAnother idea, that may be useful, is to create a file ~/.bashcm to contain the commands that need to be executed for both login and interactive shells. For example, this is usually where I place my alias commands. You will also need to include the following line in both your ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc files.\nsource ~/.bashcm\n\n\nA: /bin/sh is not bash. It is Bourne Shell.

How can I drag/move a window so that its top is above the screen?\nI want to be able to resize a window taller vertically than the screen itself, and then take a picture of the window, but I don't care about getting the window's title bar in the picture, only the content of the window, which is actually smaller than the screen but cannot all be viewed at once because of the title bar making the window's size too large.\n\nA: Enter Full Screen does exactly that. Click the green button located in the top left of most windows or type the keyboard shortcut ⌘ Cmd + CTRL + F You will notice the title bar moves right out of the viewport.\nBut this can still produce a scrolling window if there is too much content.\nSuggestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the window down to the bottom of the screen.\n\n*Grab the edge of the window to stretch it taller until you reach the top of the screen.\n\n*Press Cmd + Shift + 4 then press spacebar once. Click whichever window you would like to capture. Before clicking a window you will notice hovering over a window will highlight it in blue and the mouse will change to a camera.\n\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot repeat 1 and 2 if the window still contains too much content. This is because on the second attempt to move the stretched window down the window is automatically reformed to fit the screen.\n\n\nA: Maybe rotating the display will do the trick. Since screens are landscape by default, try this screen rotation hack to grab some screenshots in portrait mode. It's not really a hack so much as invoking hidden features with the keyboard and a mouse click.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch System Preferences\n\n*Press Cmd + Opt keys and click “Display” Note: this will not work if have an open System Preferences that has at some point had an active Display pane. In this case you will need to close the System Preferences window and start over with step 1. \n\n*Select either 90 or 180 degrees from the Rotation drop down menu.\n\n\nHappy snapping. \n", "Q: Mac refuses to sleep: Reset PreventSystemSleep?

Could you help me fix the following script?\nI have an actionscript which I use within Automator to pad any size image thrown at it into a square canvas. In other words, you need not feed it the literal dimensions of the longest side and then tell it to match the other dimension with the same pixels. (For 3000 images that would take up as much time as exporting each one manually.)\nUp until Sierra, this script would work for any number of images that I threw at it, whether I told Automator to act upon selected images, images within a folder, or if I specified the images from within Automator. Now when the script begins, it opens a Finder window requesting for me to select a single item.  (And choosing multiples from within this window will not solve the issue, as the script is looking to process one item per iteration.) In other words, the script runs once then ends. I'd like to know how to get it to run for number of items need, and I'd like to know how to make the script work without requesting items from a Finder window, particularly if I already used Get from within Automator to choose the items in question.\nSo it is clear that the script is behaving differently now, not the workflow in Automator. And to further test this, the script could just as easily be run from the AppleScript Editor, but it does the same thing.\nHere's the script in question:\nset this_file to choose file without invisibles\n-- indicate the proportions for the pad area\nset H_proportion to 1\nset V_proportion to 1\ntry\n    tell application \"Image Events\"\n        -- start the Image Events application\n        launch\n        -- open the image file\n        set this_image to open this_file\n        -- get dimensions of the image\n        copy dimensions of this_image to {W, H}\n        -- calculate pad dimensions\n        if H_proportion is greater than V_proportion then\n            set the new_W to (H * H_proportion) / V_proportion\n            set pad_dimensions to {new_W, H}\n        else\n            set the new_H to (W * V_proportion) / H_proportion\n            set pad_dimensions to {W, new_H}\n        end if\n        -- perform action\n        pad this_image to dimensions pad_dimensions with pad color {65535, 65535, 65535}\n        -- save the changes\n        save this_image with icon\n        -- purge the open image data\n        close this_image\n    end tell\non error error_message\n    display dialog error_message\nend try\n\n\nA: If I understood your question, you do not want it prompting for the files to act upon and you want it to act upon all specified files, the following will do that.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, create a new Workflow.

In other words, \"always use grayscale or black and white\" when printing.  Where can I change my printing preferences to always use grayscale?\n\nA: Current answer is wrong because Apple does not allow you to override the default. Still the answer is good for saving another preset.\nOnce you saved and selected that preset jus tbe sure that you keep Option/Alt key while pressint the print button, this will make MacOS remember your preset for the next usage --- mainly switcing the default to your current profile.\n\nA: You can set Print prefs & defaults from any print dialogue -  Cmd ⌘   P   - though specific options change with each printer type..\nAn example - \n\nFirst, in the lower half, look for 'Color' or a similar option. In there you should be able to define how to handle colour printing.\nOnce you have set that, then at the top where it says \"Default Settings, you can save the current setup & then define it as your new default.\nAdvanced options at the bottom of the dialog will very much be printer-dependant.\n", "Q: Script to toggle internet sharing using Alfred I tried many methods to toggle internet sharing with Alfred but its not working!

I would also tell the phone to check for software updates, and repeat if it installed anything. I think it MAY have been due to either a bug in a software update (which the developers quickly would have fixed), or my router/modem was having issues. \nI’m really sorry I don’t remember anything more helpful.

The hard disk is 80 GB and the first half is occupied by the Mac OS X and on the second half I'm trying to install Debian. I tried to follow a lot of different tutorials and two Linux distros: \n\n\n*\n\n*debian-mac-8.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso\n\n*debian-mac-8.6.0-i386-netinst.iso\nAlso, I've installed rEFIt and/or rEFInd, but nothing. The error I get is always the same: \nstatus: got partition of type \"unknown\" found,will not touch this disk. Error: not found returned from gptsync.efi. \n\nI get this error when I do \"start partitioning tool\" from rEFIt. And also another error:\nerror: unknown filesystem.\n\nSo, after 3 days of hard work, I don't know what to do.\nNB :\n\n\nA: I was able to reach the point in the installation process where I needed to create partitions to install Debian. This partitioning was part of the Debian installer. I did not encounter the same problems you have reported. \nI am not sure why you are using rEFIt and/or rEFInd. I did not need to.\nSome of the steps I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*I burned the file \"debian-mac-8.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso\" to a RW DVD\nusing the Disk Utility application. The OS X was Yosemite. I assume\nSnow Leopard would work the same.\n\n*I did not need rEFIt or rEFInd to start the installation. I just\nrestarted the Mac and held down the option key to invoke the Startup\nManager. Next, I inserted the DVD and waited for the DVD icon labeled\n\"EFI boot\" to appear. Finally I select this icon to boot from.\n\n*I choose the \"Graphical install\" option when prompted.\n\n*My connection to the internet is hardwired, so I did not have to\nconfigure wireless settings.\n\n*The installer did not have the software for Broadcom wireless\nhardware in my Mac. I instructed the installer to bypass this\nproblem.\nPerhaps you could modify your question to include the output from the following Terminal application commands. These commands will not change your Mac. The commands just give me a better understanding of how your drive is partitioned.\ndiskutil list\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\n\n", "Q: How to completely disable Siri on Sierra? I have answered 'No' to Siri initial prompt, but I can still see it in my process list. I've tried to kill it, but it loads again immediately. How can I unload and remove Siri from my Mac?\n\n\nA: Der Flounder post Blocking Siri on macOS Sierra contains plist files that keeps her from running and suppresses her from the menu bar:\ncom.apple.assistant.support.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Assistant Enabled</key>\n    <false/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\ncom.apple.Siri.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>StatusMenuVisible</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>UserHasDeclinedEnable</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThere are also mobileconfig files to have it automatically disabled by the scripts linked there too.\n\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*you might have to fiddle your way around the SIP (System Integrity Protection mode) before you can actually modify these files.\n\n*the referenced files are copied over from the equivalent settings for iOS, and may not necessarily work as expected on Sierra. Use with care! \n\n\nA: Ok, I found out the whole procedure by myself, thanks to @blueberryfields and @bret7600.\nFirst of all you need to disable System Integrity Check to be able to edit the com.apple.Siri.plist file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot in Recovery mode by restarting your Mac and holding Command+R.

I don't recommend disable it cause you need to disable SIP.\n", "Q: Setting environment variables (TEXINPUTS) in El Capitan I am a user of TeXShop, an application launched from the Launchpad. Everything works great except that in order to get full functionality, I need to set the TEXINPUTS environment variable. (To be precise, the variable must be set for certain processes launched by TexShop. It is normally inherited from the parent process.)\nUntil I upgraded to El Capitan, I could do this by calling launchctl setenv TEXINPUTS some-appropriate-value. Unfortunately, this has stopped working after upgrading. The command appears to succeed, and querying with launchctl getenv TEXINPUTS shows me the value I set, but it is not passed to applications I launch from the GUI. (I have confirmed this by launching a Terminal and checking the environment.)\nThe launchctl manual page has this to say about the config system command:\n\npath:     Sets the PATH environment variable for all services within the target domain to\n  the string value.  [...] Note that if a service specifies its\n  own PATH, the service-specific environment variable will take precedence.\nNOTE: This facility cannot be used to set general environment variables for all\n  services within the domain. It is intentionally scoped to the PATH environment\n  variable and nothing else for security reasons. \n\nSo it seems that Apple (a) does not want to pass my environment settings to applications willy-nilly, may have a way to customize the environment of specific \"services\". Does anyone know how I can get my editor to \"see\" the TEXINPUTS variable?\nPS. Almost all related questions I've seen are about setting PATH. Solutions specific to setting the system path are not going to help here.\n\nA: The problem is well known and is due to Apple - the /usr folder cannot be anymore written. The solution is to add a link to this location: /Library/TeX/texbin - depending also on your TeX version, see more info in this link: https://tug.org/mactex/elcapitan.html\n", "Q: MacOS Sierra vs my installer DMG's icon I am distributing my (heavily edited in the picture below) app via a read-only installer DMG. Both the app and the DMG are signed and pass the Gateway validation.  My build machine is an El Capitan 10.11.6. \nOn Sierra (10.12) only, after mounting the DMG, this is what Finder shows me (except the popup on the left that, of course, I trigger afterwards):\n \nAs you can see:\n\n\n*\n\n*the Applications icon is not what one would expect;\n\n*right-click -> Get Info shows the expected icon for the alias (at the upper-side as well as under Preview).\n\n\nForce-quitting Finder will rectify this situation. \nI downloaded a Skype for Mac kit, knowing that it uses the same deployment mechanism. Interestingly, the Applications icon is properly shown from the get-go.\nAnother interesting aspect is that hitting Get Info on my DMG's Applications alias will display (at the bottom of the window) the Sharing & Permissions section, while the Skype one won't.   \nDetails that may be relevant: my DMG is created using a \"template\" one, that I am modifying, then cloning and making the clone read-only. The alias placed on the template image is an alias that I created on my system and simply copied it there.\nI would appreciate any idea on what I am doing wrong. Thank you. [Question updated below, left this one for consistency purposes.]\n[UPDATE] Found this SOV thread, which seems to suggest that I am not doing anything wrong per-se. Is there any work-around, e.g. relaunching Finder programmatically after it opens the window (AppleScript)? Or something even less ugly? I wouldn't bet my $ on Apple fixing this anytime soon, as Finder \"fetching\" apps \"in a hurry\" and showing the strike-through circle over their icon as if they were broken, while they were not in fact, was a long-standing issue.\n\nA: My original comment: It looks like you're using a Finder alias to the Applications, rather than a unix-style symbolic link. Aliases store a lot of info about the original item on the computer it was created on, which sometimes confuses things when they're moved to another computer. Try creating a symlink instead, with something like ln -s /Applications /Volumes/QST-6.5-devel-setup/Applications -- that might be better-behaved.\nHere's a more detailed comparison of the two:\n\nThe Finder's Info window lists them both as \"Kind: Alias\", but only the true alias has a \"Select New Original\" button. Also, the symlink is much smaller, since true aliases include all sorts of information about the original item (the file's file ID number (inode) and name, the file ID and path of the folder it was in, info about what volume it was on, if the volume was a disk image or network volume, it'll have info about how to remount the volume, ...). My example alias, at 612 bytes, is much smaller than yours, probably because it was made under Sierra, and I think Sierra may've changed the format a little. The symlink, by comparison, is only 13 bytes -- it's really just the text \"/Applications\" (which is 13 characters).\nThe difference in the amount of info they have has important implications for how they work. True aliases are much more robust: you can rename a file, or move it to a different folder, and the alias can still find it by file ID; on the other hand, if you delete & replace it, it'll find the replacement by name & folder. A symlink, on the other hand, is more fragile: if you move or rename the original file, the symlink has no info at all that can help locate it.\nBut for portability, the lack of additional info in a symlink is actually a real advantage: on a different computer, the everything will have a different file ID, the volume info will obviously different, etc. Worse, some completely other file might have the same ID as the original had on your computer, and the alias might(*) resolve to it! All that extra information is really just creating opportunities for confusion. But the Applications folder will always be at \"/Applications\", so the symlink will always resolve to it, with no possibility for confusion.\n(*) [Edit:] A long time ago, if an alias resolved to one file by file ID and a different file by folder&name, the ID match would take precedence. Apple switched the priority a while back -- either in an early OS X version or maybe even a late Mac OS 9 version, I don't remember -- so now the file ID should really only cause trouble if nothing exists at the \"right\" path. But if you create a true alias to, say,  /Library/Application Support/YourApp, and that doesn't exist on some other computer, it might resolve to any other file or folder that happens to have the same file ID.\nThere's another difference I forgot to mention: all of the file access APIs in OS X know how to resolve symlinks, so they work great with both GUI apps and command-line and ported unix tools. True aliases, on the other hand, are only understood by the Cocoa and Carbon APIs (basically, the Apple-proprietary GUI programming environments), so command-line tools (which use plain POSIX APIs) just see them as files, and have no clue how to resolve them to the original item. This isn't relevant in your situation, but I thought I should add it for completeness.\n", "Q: Wifi connection slow on Mac only My iMac (Ver 10.9.5 for reasons, iMac is from 2012) has an observed download speed of ~100KBps. On speedtest.net, it tells me the speed is ~800Kbps, so it matches up. However, on other devices, the download speed is way higher, about 35Mbps. \nThe modem is an Asus, RT-N66U. The router is an ARRIS surfboard SB6141.\nThe connection is wireless.\nThe RSSI is -47, MCS index is 23, Noise is -88, speed is 217Mbps, Phy mode is 802.11n. The country code is US.\nCould anyone help fix the slow connection on this Mac?\n\nA: This was extremely fast, but I was fiddling with the wifi settings, and I noticed the ASUS traffic manager was enabled. Upon disabling it, I had the same download speed as other devices. It had limited my own device for whatever reason.\n", "Q: How to backup specific apps on OS X El Capitan? I own a late-2013 Retina MBP 13\" running latest El-Capitan OS X version. \nCurrently I feel it's so polluted with crappy files and apps. What I wanna do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup my personal files\n\n*Backup my important apps and their state (settings, files, ...)\n\n*Factory reset (I don't if this term is used for MacBooks) my MacBook.\n\n*Upgrade to macOS Sierra\n\n*Bring back my important apps and their settings back.\n\n\nI know there are ways to backup the whole session. And I know I may find a way to manually backup each app. What I'm looking for is an app that does the backup for a single app automatically.\n\nA: If you are giving away your mac at the momment and not keeping it, follow this method here.\nBacking up your Mac and your files:\nYou can use the native app called Time Machine(already installed on every mac, no matter what) to back up every single thing on your Mac to a disk you choose(can be to an external hard drive or usb) and restore to that backup when you update or you can exclude certain files to not backup in Time Machine, but backup everything else. To figure out how, click here.\nNote:\nI would recommend updating to macOS Sierra first before doing the following steps, but it is fine to upgrade after.\n\"Factory resetting your Mac\"\nMake sure everything has been backed properly. Go into the apple menu and click on restart. This next text has been copied and pasted from this article here.\n\n\"During the restart process, before moving onto the login screen, your computer will show a gray slate screen. This is your opportunity to go behind the scenes: Hold down both the Command key and the R key when you see gray. This should pop you over to the MacOS Utilities, where you can make various important and potentially dangerous changes. Select Disk Utility from the window. Now, this process is going to be a little different based on what version of MacOS you are using, but you will want to look for your startup disk or other startup-related information. Select it and then click on the Erase tab. Next, head over to the Format option and set it to Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Again select Erase. This may take some time. Once finished, go to the Disk Utility menu and select Quit Disk Utility.\"\n\nYou should be at a screen similar to this(depends on your mac version): For this next step you must have your Mac connected to the internet otherwise it won't work. You need an internet connection for this step because this is where your Mac pulls a new copy of macOS from Apple's servers.\n\n\"Once you have quit out of Disk Utility, you should see an option to Reinstall your current MacOS. Select that reinstall option, confirm that you really want to do it, and proceed. You may have to click through a few confirmations before the installation is ready to begin.\"\n\nAfter this, your Mac is as good as new. If you haven't already updated to macOS Sierra, set up your Mac as if it was new, then update.\n", "Q: How to limit audio volume on iPhone for all apps? I looked at restrictions and volume limit, but it does not limit volume for all apps (eg. youtube or VLC). Is there any way I can limit volume for all apps?\n\nA: iOS handles volume differently depending on the task at hand. For example, the volume for playing games is set differently to the volume for playing videos.\nIn your example, YouTube and VLC are both for playing videos. If you need the audio level for these types of apps to be lower (or off) you need to play a video and then lower the volume. Once you've done this, iOS remembers this for all video playing apps (i.e. turning it down on VLC will mean that it's also down for other video playing apps).\nYou just need to remember then that even if you turn your volume up while using the phone, that when you next play a video it will still be at the level it was at when you last played a video.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: mac mini flashing mouse repetitive sound wont let me click on stuff https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5NeoGTkkZ4&index=2&list=PLTlfSplem0iX3CLphwxx5fPGD98ydgbpZ\nokay so basically half a week ago my computer would start making weird sounds and not letting me click on anything. pretty sure that's not normal for macs, but anyway, i have searched long and hard for the solution tried restarting my computer, using all the computer repair tools built into the mac\nliterally nothing has helped. now i have two main theories, either my computer has been cursed or hive a virus. no clue what to do.\nany help at all would be very very very much appreciated\nPs: i had to use someone else's computer to post this (yes it's that bad)   \n\nA: i eventually just decided to do a factory reset, it worked.\n", "Q: How can I instantly move the cursor to the end of a long document in iOS? I edit Markdown documents on iPhone 7 sometimes. Some of the documents I want to work with are pretty long — 15,000 words or more.\nWhen I open a document to work on it (for example in the Byword or Ulysses apps, or even just a really long email), usually I want to append new text to the end of the document.\nScrolling to the end of a 15k-word file by swiping repeatedly takes a really long time.\nIs there some functional equivalent of an \"end\" button in iOS?\n\nUPDATE\nHm. We seem to be getting hung up on the idea of an \"end button.\" Maybe I shouldn't have used that analogy.\nBy \"equivalent to\" I mean any UI control, whether it's a gesture or a hidden control or anything at all that will take you directly to the end of a file. It doesn't have to be a button.\nTo be clear, what I'm asking is, is there some way, any way, to go instantly to the end of a file?\n\nA: Based on your updated question, the answer is no; there's not a standard, built-into iOS way to go to the end of a file. \nIndividual apps are able to create custom gestures or menu commands to perform that function, so it might exist in specific apps but there's no standard way that works with every app.\n\nA: My long doc is a roll up of my notes for the year so I can do a Find for something like \"08-25\" to jump to my entry for August 25, for example, but that of course won't work in all files.\n", "Q: Wait for 50 years to unlock Today I wanted to backup my old iPhone which I didn't use for a long time and never tried to unlock it for one year now.

Nothing. \nThese ghost entries do not show up when using Finder search.\nWhere are Spotlight caches stored other than .Spotlight-V100 ? There must be a place so that they survive cache rebuilding.\nI am on 10.12.1 MBP and it is a clean install from two days. No use of migration assistant, etc. No external disk currently connected. Single partition.\n\n\nA: The indexing is not finished, I would wait until it is finished before considering an error. \nIf the indexing is still going on 2 days after the clean install, you either have a big drive with a lot of files or it's hung on something. That usually happens with wrong permissions on some files and in worse cases because of I/O errors of the drive. \nIn order to check that you should take the following steps:\nFirst: run the Disc Utility found in /Applications/Utilities/ to check your drive and repair permissions.

If an app running on my iPhone is currently in the process of background refreshing, if I open up the app and bring it to the foreground, what happens to the app and to the background fetch? \nDoes the background refresh process keep running until it is complete or times out, or does it stop the process? \nDoes it prevent the app from loading until it's background refresh process has completed? \n\nA: It should keep performing the refresh but it all depends on how the developer coded the app.  As always, there's proper and improper ways to handle a background refresh and the onus is on the developer to ensure they're using the appropriate techniques and API.  \nThe app should show the most-recent info it has immediately upon opening (assuming, of course, that it was developed with that capability).  The refresh that was ongoing will continue.  Ideally, once the app has been loaded and is ready to interface with the user, it should refresh itself with the latest available data.  If the developer created the app this way, the user might see old data immediately upon opening the app but then the data will change within a few seconds as the new data is presented.\n", "Q: Outlook Spell Checker on MAC I am looking for a way to stop sending an email if there are any spelling errors on outlook 2016 Mac.

Then the EVO 850 was placed internally to MBP 2011 and all worked perfectly fine.\nBecause there was a problem with the MBP 2011, I removed the EVO 850 and placed back the hard disk. It was sent for repair but instead we got another MBP 2011.\nThe 'new' MBP is working fine with the hard disk so I replaced it with the EVO 850. MBP did not boot normally but seemed to boot from the recovery partition showing a \"OS X Utilities\" window with 4 options of which one was Disk Utility.\nThe EVO 850 showed up as \"Untitled\". First Aid ran fine and ended in Okay quickly.\nI swapped the disks again with EVO 850 as external via USB. Shows up the same way in Disk Utilities and MBP is working fine with hard disk.\nWhen running # diskutil list is shows up as \n/dev/disk2 (external, physical) \n0: GUID_partition_scheme                               500.1GB\n1:                                 EFI EFI             209.7MB\n2:                           Apple_HFS                 499.1GB\n3:                          Apple_Boot Recovered HD    650.0MB\n\nHow do I get this disk to behave as a bootable disk again, or if that's not feasible, how can I access it and save some data?\n\nA: This fix is going to involve moving the changed data from the SSD to the HDD so you can then do a clean install on the SSD.\n\n*\n\n*Move data from the SDD to the HDD\n\n*Verify data on HDD\n\n*Swap HDD and SDD (SDD to be internal)\n\n*Wipe SDD and do a clean install of OS\n\n*Migrate data from SSD to HDD\n\n*Set up CCC to clone SSD to HDD as backup.\n\nPrerequisites\nYou should have the following:\n\n*\n\n*USB Installer of macOS Sierra or OS X El Capitan\n\n*Preferably a different HDD (you only need a 250 to 300GB drive to backup the SSD)\n\n*A backup of your Keychain\n\n*A backup of your Application Settings where applicable\n\n1. Move data from the SDD to the HDD\nIn your comments you said that the data on the SSD changed.  You need to copy over the user data from from the SSD to the HDD.\nPreferably, you should have another HDD to do a quick clone of your SSD as an extra layer of insurance. However, it's not absolutely necessary.\nTo move your data from the SSD to the HDD  you need to create a directory on your HDD somewhere and call it SSD Data Backup or something that identifies it as where it came from.  You can do it in your home directory, it really doesn't matter, just so long you know where it is.  Then go into the SSD /Users/ directory and copy over your entire directory to the SSD Data Backup you created earlier.\n2. Verify data on HDD\nMake sure that everything you copied over from the SSD is on the HDD.  I can't stress this step too lightly.  Once you proceed there's no going back.\n3. Swap HDD and SDD (SDD to be internal).\nNow that you have a backup of your SSD data on your HDD, it's time to swap out the drives.  You should now have the SSD internally and the HDD externally.  Don't connect the HDD until you have finished step 4.\n4. Wipe SDD and do a clean install of the OS.\nDelete the partitions, everything.  You need to have a single partition so that when the OS is installed, it will create all the necessary partitions for you like the boot partition, and the recovery partition. Set it up like you just got it from the factory.\n5. Migrate data from SSD to HDD.\nOnce you have your new OS installed on your new SSD, it's time to move the data back.  Attach the HDD (now external) and you can copy things back.  You can use:\n\n*\n\n*Migration Assistant\n\n*Copy the whole directory and retake permissions\n\n*Copy individual items\n\n(I personally go for the third option because it allows me to do a genuinely clean install)\n6. Set up CCC to clone SSD to HDD as backup.\nOnce you have everything setup to your satisfaction, you can now use CCC to clone your SSD to your HDD.  Keep in mind the way CCC works is that you clone your drive to an external for backup purposes.  If/When things go sideways, you get a new drive and clone FROM the external to the new, not swap.\n", "Q: iTerm spits out text every time I start a new session - why, and how to stop it? Whenever I start a new session with iTerm, it sends sudo su and PS1=\"[web stage | \\d \\t \\w]:\" to the terminal window. I'm think this is something that someone set up for me in iTerm a long time ago. It's very irritating and I want it to stop. :-)\nI looked all over the settings/prefs in iTerm and can't find any sign of what could be doing it, nor the string sudo su or PS1= anywhere. (And yes, Profiles > Command > Send Text at Start is empty-- that was my first thought but nothing there.)\nI am 99% sure this is something from iTerm and not bash because when I launch the Terminal app, I don't get this behavior.\nWhere would this be stored and how can I stop it?\n-- EDIT to add details:\nIt's not \"Send Text at Start.\"\nThis is happening only in iTerm, not Terminal.

It's sort of an interface issue in iTerm, though it's a bit of an edge case.\nIt turns out there was stuff in the \"send text at start\" field. The first character in there was a newline (\\n), so in the interface screen shot, the field looked empty. But when I clicked in there and pressed the down arrow, \"sudo su\" showed up (the first line of what was being sent).\nProps to the developer, George Nachman, who pushed me in the right direction. I turned on the debugging log and found this:\n \"Initial Text\" = \"\\nsudo su\\nPS1=\\\"[web stage | \\\\d \\\\t \\\\w]:\\\"\\n\"\n\nSo that was the clue I needed.\nThanks to everyone who puzzled over this with me...\n", "Q: How to make macOS and iOS connect to the stronger WiFi I have a modem/router in my room which is at the back of the house. As I was having poor reception in the front side of my home, I've got one of the cheap ADSL routers and I'm using that as another hotspot (connected via ethernet to my fiber router) and I'm using that for the WiFi at the living room. Whenever I come home from outside, I first pass through the living room momentarily to get to my room. And all my Apple devices insist on automatically connecting to the living room's hotspot, which has poor reception in my room. If it connects even once, it will not automatically connect to the much stronger hotspot unless I turn off Wifi and turn it on again manually. It sucks because when I arrive home, I almost always need to turn off Wifi on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro, which is extremely inconvenient.\nDeleting the living room's password from my keychain would obviously avoid the issue, though I'd always need to re-enter the password and delete it afterwards when I use the internet at the living room, which is even more inconvenient.\nI've also tried naming them the same, but it messes everything up (and apparently causes problems with routing) so I'd better keep the SSIDs separate.\nHow do I solve this problem?\n\nA: If the one in the living room is connected to the main router via ethernet, just change it to access point only mode. Stop assigning addresses from this router. Set it to the same SSID as the other (stronger) router, and your devices should hand off to whichever signal is stronger at the moment. I have one router at home, plus two more in different areas, set up this way, and there are no issues. When I'm upstairs, devices connect to the access point; when downstairs, they connect directly to the main router, transparently.\n", "Q: Playing background sounds while talking in Skype I'm trying to let someone hear all sounds played on my Mac while talking in Skype. Simple test: call Skype test while playing Youtube music and talking, both talk and music should be recorded and played back.\nFor this I created two devices in Audio MIDI Setup app: \n\n\n*\n\n*Aggregate device (Built-in Mic, Soundflower(64ch)) and\n\n*Multi-Output device (Built-in Output, Soundflower(64ch))\n\n\nI selected them as default input and default output correspondingly.\nDepending on ordering of Soundflower and Mic in Aggregate device either only talk or only music is recorded.\nHow to change Aggregate device to record (transfer in Skype) both background music and talk?\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to have your background sounds on your Skype audio is do do this via hardware; have the audio on a different set of speakers the microphone (or input device) can pickup.  \nIt can be Bluetooth or USB (easier).  You can't use the headphone port because when you plug in the headphones, by design, the internal speakers of your Mac will disconnect.  For example, I use the Behringer UCA202 USB Audio Interface to connect my Mac to my audio system.  All music and audio from videos etc. are piped to this device.  System sounds are relegated to my internal speakers.\n\nSkype audio (mic and headphone) are through the internal devices.  Additionally, I can mute my calls/music/whatever from this device without muting my system sounds; just by hitting mute on my audio device's remote.\n\nHowever, when I play music or videos, I pipe the audio through the USB\n\nSo, if you need your Mac's background noises to be heard, you can pipe your System Sounds through the USB audio leaving Skype with the internal audio devices; or vice versa.

Appears to begin sync and stops part ways through process and sounds as though sync is complete.  Do not use iCloud for sync.\n\nA: In case you don't want to use iCloud, you can try 3-rd party software called AkrutoSync. Unfortunately, there's no way for syncing over USB, only via Wi-Fi or over the Internet. The best part is that this software works with iPhone's native apps which I found very convenient.

(late 2013 if it matters)\nI can't damage the computer so torching the stand until it bends to lower the height of the screen is out of the question.\n\nAccording to Apple: iMac (21.5-inch and 27-inch, Late 2012 and later) computers can be configured to order with a built-in VESA mount adapter when ordering via the Apple Online Store. (...) VESA mount adapter upgrade kits are not available for iMacs with a stand.\n\nA: Option 1 - Build your own mount\nThe only way I could see getting either a new stand or a VESA mount is having a custom VESA mount built for this unit.\nIt's actually not too difficult to build the mount, you just need a flat piece of aluminum or stainless thick enough to attach to the mounting plate of the hinge (area circled) in pic below and long enough that comes out the back of the iMac and either welded or screwed onto a flat plate with the proper VESA mounting holes so you could attach any arm or 3rd party stand.\n\nMaking the bracket wouldn't be all that difficult.  Any welding shop or machine shop could fabricate it for you.   All you really needs is an \"L\" or \"T\" shaped bracket (instead of the articulating head in the pic below) for the VESA mounting holes.  But you would want the mount to come out of the back of the case in a similar fashion.\n\nNormally, I would recommend this product because it's elegant and German made (German engineering is top rate), but after researching their site, they don't make anything for iMacs after 2011.\nThe toughest part of this custom build would actually be the complete teardown of the iMac to install your new mounting bracket.\nSo, it's not impossible, it's just a very involved process.\nOption 2 - An Ikea Hack\nbmike got me thinking...  How to do this cleanly, but very inexpensively...\nYou could get a shelf from Ikea like the  EKBY JÄRPEN and mount it to the wall at a height below your desk that lowers the screen to your comfortable viewing height.  Sort of like in the picture below.  It's hard to see, but the iMac is sitting on a support on the lower shelf (lighting is horrible)\n\n\nA: Inexpensive - no way to modify the Mac. Instead modify the table or change chairs or what the person stands on. Those are all far less expensive to customize. \nThe expense of opening or modifying the Mac is the self-insurance you need to set aside if you damage and/or break something and have to pay for it to be fixed professionally. Not all open/repairs break something, but these iMac aren't trivially opened due to how thin and delicate they are and how the adhesives to keep it solid need to be carefully managed and replenished each repair.\n\nA: I used two options, both based on a vertically adjustable keyboard \"tray\" (not really a tray, just an adjustable portion of the desk meant for the keyboard): \nOption 1) I used 3\" length thread stock to extend/raise, rather than lower, my keyboard portion of the desk. Then I simply raised my body to be ergonomic with the keyboard and iMac display - my chair extends tall (for use with a drafting table, for instance). And a footrest because now my feet don't reach flat on the floor.\nOption 2) I lowered the keyboard portion of the desk (as is the normal functionality of that piece), placed the iMac on it (now lowered), spun the desk around and sat at the normally \"back\" side of the desk at normal height with the keyboard on top of the desk. It looks just like the ikea hack pic in this thread, only it is part of the desk rather than a shelf attached to the wall.

So when there's an Apple Event, and someone does a demo of how Siri works or play a game, etc; Are those done on real time or were they prerecorded?

While connected to the Skype Meetings App, you are given the option to specify specific devices for audio output and input.  However, since this is a selection within the Skype application, normal volume control doesn't seem to function.  Instead, increasing/decreasing volume seems to change the volume settings of the primary audio device.\n\nA: This one has both stumped and annoyed me for a while.  I had been unable to find a solution to this online but, eventually, I figured it out so I figured I'd share my discovery.\nTo modify the volume you need to click on the speaker icon on the Mac menu.  \n\nAfter clicking on the speaker icon, a little menu will show up showing the available audio devices.  Select your headset and then the hot-key volume controls and the volume slider will adjust the volume on your headset.\nOnce you've modified your volume settings, you can set your primary audio device back to what it previously was.  Your settings on your headset will remain the same, even if you adjust the volume on your primary speakers.\nIt's pretty simple once you figure out but wasn't immediately obvious.\n", "Q: How can I disable the iMessage app temporarily on my iPhone My spouse frequently snoops thru my iPhone at night, how can I disable my iMessage app on iPhone?\n\nA: You cannot actually disable iMessage as an app, as it is integrated within your Messages. iMessage was introduced by Apple as an alternative texting feature between Apple devices (Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad) over WiFi rather than through your carrier which would require a texting (SMS/MMS) plan.\nYou can however disable iMessages in your settings -> Messages -> toggle off iMessage.\nHowever this would just cause messages to come in via SMS instead of iMessage, unless the sender can only send an iMessage (such as a Mac, iPod or iPad without carrier), in which case the sender won't be able to send to you at all.\nMy recommendation is turn of the phone, turn on airport, set a lock password, fingerprint, or hide your phone better. :)\n", "Q: Does Automator keep a log of all changed files? I ran a batch rename of all files named index.html to index.php with Automator - I meant to run it on a specific folder and instead ran it on my whole computer. I can't undo the changes as far as I know (no time machine backup either). Does automator have a log of the files that were changed?\n\nA: Automator doesn't keep a log file, if you didn't include some logging routine in the action itself.\nYou should be able to find all falsely renamed index.html files by checking the modify date of superior folders: search for all files with the name index.php and check if the modify date of the superior folder is the same as the execution date of the Automator action. If the modify date is the same, the file (not located at the \"specific\" folder) was renamed unintentionally. If the modify date of the superior folder is earlier than the Automator action execution date the file wasn't renamed.\nTo get all folders containing a file index.php quickly, enter:\nsudo find / -type f -name 'index.php' |sed 's#\\(.*\\)/.*#\\1#' |sort -u\n\nTo get a list of folders sorted by modify date with ls use something like this:\nls -dl $(find / -type f -name 'index.php' |sed 's#\\(.*\\)/.*#\\1#')\n\nThe last command doesn't work for paths containing spaces!\n", "Q: Outlook 15.27 Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E shortcuts no longer working I often have to use the Ctrl A and Ctrl E shortcuts to get to the start and end of lines in Outlook, and it looks like in the latest version (15.27), these no longer work.  Instead Ctrl A behaves like Windows and selects everything, and Ctrl E doesn't seem to do anything.  \nI can't figure out anything in settings or another way to override this behavior - has anyone encountered this or figured out a workaround?\n\nA: I tested this out and can confirm that this did stop working.

In the error log, I see thousands of error messages. Here's generally what they look like:\n\n2016-10-27 16:13:31.330679-0500  localhost mtmd[745]: (TimeMachine)\n  [com.apple.TimeMachine.TMLogError] -[FileAttrs\n  writeAttributesToItemAtPath:] setattrlist failed for path\n  '/.MobileBackups/Computer/2016-10-27-161316/Volume/Library/Preferences'\n  (errno 1)\n\nThe errors are slightly different only at the end (/.MobileBackups/Computer...)\nUltimately, the backup takes days before the connection to the server is reset for some reason and the backup fails to complete.\nWhat are these errors and what do I need to do to fix this?\n\nA: It may relate to this and/or help someone else figure out more about this but when I look at directories that are subject to the failure on my Mac, I see:\n    sudo ls -al@ '/.MobileBackups/Computer/2016-11-05-233040/Volume/Library/'\n    total 0\n    d------r-x@ 4 root  wheel  136 Nov  5 23:33 .\n        com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked     3 \n        com.apple.s stem.Security    68\n    drwxr-xr-x@ 5 root  wheel  170 Nov  5 23:30 ..\n        com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeFSEventStoreUUID     36 \n        com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeLastFSEventID    20 \n        com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeUUID     36 \n    d------r-x  5 root  wheel  170 Nov  5 23:32 Application Support\n    d------r-x@ 4 root  wheel  136 Nov  5 23:33 Preferences\n        com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked     3\n\nI imagine most of these file attributes are related to Time Machine's local backup process, but I also notice that one of the attributes is com.apple.s stem.Security .. note the blank character in the system path component.  Could that be confusing things?  For example, if that attribute was set with that typo and later cleared (or attempted to be) with it spelled correctly, you would see an error like this.\nJust guessing ..\n\nA: I don't have a definite answer yet either, but I'm basing my approach on bad content/permissions in the .MobileBackups subtree. Since these files store incremental backups in-between true Time Machine backups, I'm somewhat comfortable removing them and \"starting fresh\".\nViewing the logs:\nMissing from the question is how to view the Time Machine logs. I installed a script in my /usr/local/bin directory, based on the answer here. However, a more straightforward command is simply:\nlog stream --style syslog --info --predicate 'processImagePath contains \"backupd\" and subsystem beginswith \"com.apple.TimeMachine\"'\n\nInvestigating Logged Errors\nInspecting the directories, there didn't seem to be much \"off\" about them (as @RamsayCons points out in his answer). Since I didn't care much about the most recent mobile backup, I decided to simply remove it:\nsudo rm -rf /.MobileBackups/Computer/2016-12-16-112458\n\nA few notes about this command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remember that with sudo comes great power.

While I am writing this, I have to be in Safe Mode as it let me control more than in when in normal mode, although it has auto zoom the screen. \nIn normal mode, the clicks are happening on their own, something lookup, many times dictionary open up, and zoom is happening. \nI had talk to Apple expert on phone, in which he told me about safe mode, and we were able to delete .coms for Mouse and Trackpad. That didn't solve the issue. Apple expert told me to reinstall OS and if that doesn't fix problem, it must be hardware. \nI cannot reinstall the OS as my net is so slow and there is no guarantee if it will solve it.  I have  not dropped my laptop to which I can say it is hardware problem. \nI thought external mouse might help, but that didn't either, same thing happening with a wireless mouse. \nWhat can the reason and what are my option, as this is my bread and butter.\n\nA: It very much sounds like a physical hardware issue. For an external mouse to make a difference you must make sure your built-in trackpad gets disabled when the mouse is connected, or the ghost events will keep happening since the trackpad is still active.\nGo Prefs > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad and make sure \"Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse is connected\" is selected.\n\nA: Check if you battery is not starting to inflated, because it can affect the Trackpad behaviour.\n", "Q: Ghost Updates on Mac My dock tells me I have 8 available updates:\n\nI also got the notification asking to install updates. However, when I open App Store, I only see recently installed updates (with no updates to apps or software visible):\n\nIf the updates are real, how do I update, and if not, how do I get rid of the bubble?\nEdit (more information):\n$ defaults read com.apple.appstore\n{\n    \"NSWindow Frame Preferences\" = \"0 116 1277 661 0 0 1280 777 \";\n    \"NSWindow Frame window_prefs\" = \"20 51 1240 726 0 0 1280 777 \";\n    SeenOSUpdates =     (\n    );\n    Storefront = \"143441-1,13 ab:WJ6jMoo1\";\n    appStoreBadgeCount = 7;\n    \"com.apple.appstore.WebKit2DeveloperExtrasEnabled\" = 1;\n    \"com.apple.appstore.WebKit2ShowsToolTipOverTruncatedText\" = 1;\n    \"com.apple.appstore.WebKit2SuppressesIncrementalRendering\" = 1;\n    \"com.apple.appstore.WebKit2UserInterfaceDirectionPolicy\" = 1;\n    \"primary.WebKit2DeveloperExtrasEnabled\" = 1;\n    \"primary.WebKit2ShowsToolTipOverTruncatedText\" = 1;\n    \"primary.WebKit2SuppressesIncrementalRendering\" = 1;\n}\n$\n\n\nA: The App Store was having problems since yesterday afternoon.\nIt was not your fault, the problem was on their end.\nBut it is back now.\n\nA: I would try the following command in the terminal to download and install updates available for your mac. All commands below require administrator privileges and will prompt for your password which is NOT relayed to the screen. You will not see the caret move at all as you type it in or be replaced by \"*\" per character of your password. This is normal.\nsudo softwareupdate -ia\n\nThis downloads and installs all available updates.\nIf perhaps you have configured a different App Store catalog (Usually done in businesses) you can run the following command first and then the above command. You can run it anyway to restore the catalog to defaults if you're not sure. \nReset default catalog for App Store:\nsudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog\n\nFor business Macs that need to restore the catalog back to the business's you can do that with the following command:\nsudo softwareupdate --set-catalog <URL GOES HERE WITHOUT BRACKETS>\n\nThe first command I stated should download and install all updates but sometimes bugs happen and things don't work. Another attempt to solve the issue could be the following command first.\nReset all ignored updates:\nsudo softwareupdate --reset-ignored -ai\n\nMore edits! Lets try seeing what the app store thinks is needing an update with this command:\ndefaults read com.apple.appstore \n\nLast possible option I can think off is to write that no updates are available. If there are updates available this won't fix that, but it'll change the updates available number.\ndefaults write com.apple.appstore appStoreBadgeCount 0 \n\nThis may change the badge count.\nSometimes nothing works, and a reinstall may be the best option.

And since I guess, that this is just a temporary bug (it can't be coincidence, that thousands of users have the same issue simultaneously...) , this should work as work around.\n\nA: The simplest solution I found was to go into cache and delete two folders called com.apple.appstore\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Finder and press ⌘ + Shift + G;\n  \n*Locate ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore and delete com.apple.appstore which are cache files;\n  \n*Then press again those commands and go /private/var/folders, open each folder and each subfolder (probably C subfolder) until you find com.apple.appstore and delete this folder;\n  \n*Restart your Mac.\n  \n\noriginal answer found at: How to fix / Reset App Store app on Mac OSX - El Capitan\n\nA: I've found that, when that happens, going to the \"Purchases\" tab will usually reveal that you've been logged out of the store somehow, and it will tell you you need to login again.  Once you've done that, you'll be able to download updates.\n\nA: Sign Out and Sign in again, and then Check for Unfinished Download solve the issue for me\nSign Out:\nIn the app store menu, click Store -> Sign Out\nSign In:\nIn the app store menu, click Store -> Sign In\nCheck for unfinished download:\nIn the app store menu, click Store -> Check for Unfinished Download\n", "Q: How do I disable command-control-up/down from doing anything with spaces? I'm trying to use some shortcuts in Sublime Text 3 (on OS X 10.9.5), but every time I press command-control-up or command-control-down, I get a Space Above or Space Below message. It doesn't do anything, and I don't really care about spaces, and I want to disable this so that OS X stops hijacking the keyboard sequence that I'm trying to use. \nAs far as I can tell, I don't use spaces at all, and would be totally cool with disabling that completely if that's an option (unless I am using it behind the scenes without realizing it).\n\nA: You should be able to disable them through Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control, and then uncheck \"Move left a space\" and \"Move right a space\".\nThose aren't actually the default shortcuts to switch spaces though, and there shouldn't be any \"message\" when using the shortcuts, so it sounds like it might be another app doing the hijacking, not OS X itself.

So I updated all three from there.\nAfter that, I went back to the 'Update' page of the App Store and found that iTunes 12.5.2 updated was now displayed and could be updated.\nBadge count is now zero!\n\nA: Had the same problem. Solved by going to the \"Purchased\" tab on the App Store, looking for software that needed to be updated (xCode, iMovie, GarageBand, Numbers, Pages, Keynote) and clicking there on \"Update\". I also started downloading a new App. Some 15 secs later they appeared on the \"Updates\" tab as well. Including a \"Software Update\" that contains a new iTunes, what I was looking for actually.\n\nA: This happened to me today. When my Mac eventually prompted me to install updates with the reminder notification, I was able to install the 6 updates. They included Garage Band and other Apple apps along with XCode.

The 500-series should be user- or app-created accounts. /usr/local/bin on my system is owned by my username \"tubedogg\" in group \"admin\", and has drwxrwxr-x as the permissions.\n\nA: The default setup for /usr/local is shown here\n~ $ ls -ld /usr/local\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  102  5 Aug 20:01 /usr/local \n\nthis means that files and directorries under /usr/local can only be created by the root user e.g. my /usr/local has\n~ $ ls -l /usr/local\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x  12 root  wheel  408 11 Sep 12:11 bin\n\nSo your share directory looks normal but the others have odd changes\ninclude and lib look like you changed the permissions of /usr/local so you could write to it and then created these two directories (The most common setup like that is installing Homebrew) (we need to see what ls -ld /usr/local shows.\nAs for bin there must have been several things. First a new user must have been added at some time, normal users (created through the System Preferences GUI start at 501) e.g. I am the second user and so my id is 502 and then the directory was created or chowned to that user- or the directory was created elsewhere and then moved as root to where it is.\nSeparately the permissions of the directory have been changed by chmod 700\nSo the correct setting is as per /usr/local/share unless you are using Homebrew in its default install and then they should be like /usr/local/include\n\nA: The /usr/local/ itself is owned by root wheel for me. But all folders that you might use as pods user bin include etc lib opt share var are owned by my user and admin group.\nTo change the ownership of a folder and files in it run:\n\nsudo chown -R john:staff /usr/local/bin\nchmod -R 755 /usr/local/bin\n\n", "Q: Should I put macbook pro to sleep or it goes alone? Before I go sleep, I use to put macbook pro to sleep. I mean, press apple menu, and then Sleep option in the menu.\nBut I noticed that if I stop to interact with the mac for a moment it gets dark. Is it going to sleep?\n\nA: Yes, this is the Mac doing what your preferences state in your Energy Preferences.\nUsually on battery macs will powernap within 5 minutes, put hard disks to sleep, app nap, and check for updates for certain things, but you can change these preferences in the Energy Preferences to determine what to do on battery and charging.\n", "Q: Why is domain name resolution slow in Sierra I have a Linux web server running in VirtualBox and after upgrading to Sierra I found that my sites on the web server are extremely slow to load.  It takes minutes.  I thought it had to do with something about the VirtualBox guest installation so I set up my sites in a Docker container but I'm seeing the same thing.\nOn a whim I turned off all networking and suddenly my sites load instantly.  This leads me to believe there's some kind of domain name resolution problem but I'm not sure where to look.\nMy development domains are in /etc/hosts which looks something like this:\n127.0.0.1 firstdomain.dev\n127.0.0.1 seconddomain.dev\n\nWhen I ping firstdomain.dev I get this:\nPING firstdomain.dev (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.089 ms\n64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.109 ms\n\nWhen I host firstdomain.dev I get this:\nfirstdomain.dev has address 127.0.53.53\nfirstdomain.dev mail is handled by 10 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.dev.\n\nI don't understand why the OS isn't looking at /etc/hosts first and going from there.  What else can I look at or do to resolve this?\nEdit: I have tried changing the .dev to .local but I still see the same thing.\n\nA: I assume you already executed all usually proposed mDSNResponder tasks to reset it, clear caches etc.\n.dev is a proper \"New gTLDs\" since 2014. Probably you are using Google Chrome to access your site(s) which often uses its own DNS query service. The flaky name resolution management in OS X as well as the Google Chrome \"service\" (which both seem to ignore /etc/hosts entries sometimes and then fail to resolve a real firstdomain.dev in the WAN) suggest to simply use another TLD like .development, .devhome or .devwork.\nAnd/or set up dnsmasq with homebrew and use localhost/127.0.0.1 as only DNS server in your network preferences. Setup proper IP addresses instead of a lot of 127.0.0.1 IP-addresses in the config files.\n\nA: It turns out the problem was actually mod_authz_host in the VM.  It was trying to do a reverse lookup on the dummy domains and sometimes timing out, sometimes not.  Since I have no need for mod_authz_host I could safely remove it.  It is curious how the upgrade to Sierra caused this though.\n", "Q: Why Macbook Pro 2016 removes F1-F12 keys but the Fn key still there Anybody know why in the new Macbook Pro 2016, they remove the ESC, F1->F12 keys with the Touch Bar but the Fn key is still there?\n\n\nA: Fn still turns Touch Bar into a function key row F1..F12\n\nA: Fn is also used for the new Siri features as well.\n", "Q: iOS 10 no longer starts lock screen music player when headphones inserted Before installing iOS 10, whenever I plugged in my headphones (or car adapter), the lock screen music player would pop up (which is very convenient).

I am trying to setup the so called \"Profile Manager\" in Apple's Server to manage a number of iOS devices for the family. The main purpose is for me to be able to (1) remotely restart the devices and (2) initiate software updates, if that's possible.\nSo far I was able to add devices to the \"Profile Manager\" and view settings for each device. I can configure different general settings, most of which I do not really care about (such as AirPrint, Mail, etc). I also know that the device still needs an iOS Software Update to get to the latest iOS version/\nUnfortunately, I can not find a way to start this update remotely. I did come across the \"About\" page in the web view of the \"Profile Manager\", which has a section on: \"OS, Built-In App, System Data File, and Security Updates\", but that simply says \"No Updates Available.\" When I check inside the iOS device under \"Software Update\", I see \"iOS 10.1\", though.\n\nAm I missing a certain setup step to get this working or are remote iOS updates just not possible?\nAdditional info that may be relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have enabled Signed configuration profiles, but the certificate is local\n\n*Everything is happening on the local network only, no public domain is involved\n\n*I did not enable any of the \"Deployment Programs\"\n\n\nA: Forcing iOS Updates to devices using Profile Manager is only possible if the devices are in the \"supervised\" state and the iOS version is out of date to begin with.\nDevice supervision (the highest level of device management, enables MUCH MORE control over devices) is only possible by: \n\n\n*\n\n*Enrolling in Apple's DEP program (really only practical for device administrators that order a lot of phones for the company)\n\n*Configuring the device through Apple's free OS X App: Configurator 2\n\n\nConf2 will enroll the device in MDM and enable \"supervision\" on the devices. \nhttp://krypted.com/iphone/enable-device-supervision-on-ios-devices-using-apple-configurator-2/\n", "Q: brew couldn't upgrade after upgrade xcode 7.3.1 to 8.1 I upgraded xcode from 7.3.1 to 8.1 and also I update homebrew using [brew update]. after that I could use [brew upgrade].

I've set it up with BootCamp and Windows 7 back in 2010. \nWhen in macOS, I can change the boot disk to BOOTCAMP and it will boot Windows 7 on restart.\nWhen in Windows7, there is the BootCamp tray icon I can click and choose \"Boot to OS X\", but on reboot it will not load macOS but will boot from the \"OS X Base System\" instead.\nIs there a way I can fix BootCamp in Windows, so it will choose the right macOS disk instead of this recovery disk?\nThe reason I'd need to do this is that I wanted to upgrade to a PC graphics card. The card works great in macOS and in Windows 7, but it doesn't show the boot menu (ALT at startup), so the only way I could get back to macOS from Windows is to choose \"Boot to OS X\".\nI updated to macOS Sierra 10.12.1 and also installed a new BootCamp version in Windows (BootCamp 5.1) but the problem is still there.\nMy guess is, that back when I installed BootCamp in 2010, OS X didn't have that recovery disk yet.

One year later, what are the differences?\n\nA: You could use something like the also newly-launched Apple Thunderbolt 3 USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 adapter. Apple's 12\" MacBook has a USB-C port but does not integrate Thunderbolt into it, so Apple did not make a product which needed a Thunderbolt 3 to 2 adapter until now. \n", "Q: How to run AppleScript in a Crontab?

Can I use the Touch Bar to access function keys in Windows?\n\nA: I actually had the same question as I want to use Boot Camp and the function buttons are now virtual and their answer was that yes Apple will provide a setting in Boot Camp to have the function buttons appear in the Touch Bar.\nI'll provide the exact text from my chat:\n\nDavid: \n  Hey there, my name is David. Welcome to the Apple Online Store. I would be very happy to help you with your questions about the new MacBook Pro.\nDavid: \n  This product will definitely be capable of running in Boot Camp mode. May I ask, are you already using a device in this way now?\nMe: \n  I'm currently using a MacBook Pro for late 2010 and am running Windows 7 on it\nMe: \n  The reason of my questioning is due to the Touch Bar which makes the Function keys a virtual thing\nDavid: \n  Yes, they will be virtual, but there is a setting that allows you to show the function keys.\nDavid: \n  When in boot camp mode, you’d want to switch the touch bar to this setting, and they should function like normal.\n\n\nA: Here's your answer from MacRumours:\nOne of the biggest questions about the Touch Bar on Apple's new MacBook Pro is how it will work with Windows through Boot Camp. That led MacRumors reader Abraham to send an email to Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi, who shared good news for dual-booters.\n\"Craig, am I correct in assuming that the Touch Bar becomes a row of visual function keys when using Windows with Boot Camp?\" \nCraig Federighi: \"You are indeed!\"\nPresumably, this means the Touch Bar will likely display virtual function keys between F1-F12, along with an Escape key, when running Windows. It remains to be seen if there will be specific controls for system-level tasks such as volume, playback, and display brightness. Meanwhile, the virtual power button should work, but without Touch ID. \n\nA: I have a MacBoook Pro with touch bar, and I use BootCamp. When my machine is running Windows 10 the touch bar shows (from left to right) \"esc (dim screen)(brighten screen) (dim keyboard backlight)(brighten keyboard backlight) (rewind)(play/pause)(fast forward) (mute)(reduce volume)(increase volume)\", where items in (parentheses) are represented by icons. All are black & white; no colour.\nWhen I hold down the fn key the touch bar shows \"esc F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 F11 F12\".\nIn both states, touching the touch bar does activate the corresponding function.\nIf I run iTunes in Windows 10 the touch bar doesn't change. I infer from this that Apple does not expose an interface in Windows for touch bar customization.\n\nA: From this rarely recent Apple Discussion:\n\nThere are no Bootcamp drivers that support TouchID functionality on\n  Windows. You should provide Product Feedback - Apple.\n\n\nA: I am currently using bootcamp windows 10 on my 2016 MBP 15\" w/ TouchBar and it works perfectly fine.

The only alternative would be to wipe all the old data & set up as a new device, then repurchase the things belonging to the old ID. [This would also require the permission [password etc] of the ID giving up the device.\nIf all you really require is to change the email address associated with your ID, then you can do that - the ID itself is not dependant on any given email address [in fact it doesn't even have to be an email address, it's just easier to think that way]\nSee Apple KB : Change your Apple ID for full details.\n\nA: I move things from one iCloud folder to another using PathFinder.

Is it safe to do so?\n\nA: I think there is one more way of doing it. You just have to go to the Application folder, select the application and press CMD + Delete. Once you do this, the particular application will disappear from your launchpad as well.\n\nA: Remove Applications from Launchpad One at a Time\nThere are two ways to do this, one is through the Launchpad itself, and the other is through the Terminal using the command line:\nMethod 1) Using Launchpad – Mac App Store apps only\nHold down the Option key, and once the icons start jiggling click the “X” shown in the corner of icons that you want to delete. This removes the app from Launchpad, and does not uninstall them, but this is limited to apps installed from the Mac App Store. If you want to remove an app not installed through the Mac App Store, you have to use the method below:\nMethod 2) Using the Terminal – removes any application\nLaunch the Terminal and enter the following command, replacing “APPNAME” with the name of the application you want to remove from Launchpad:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db \"DELETE from apps WHERE title='APPNAME';\" && killall Dock\n\nFor example, removing TmpDisk would be:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db \"DELETE from apps WHERE title='TmpDisk';\" && killall Dock\n\nLaunchpad will automatically refresh, open it to see the changes.\n", "Q: Does Touch ID for Mac Touch Bar support third-party apps?

This is down to an advanced feature that seems to be now enabled by default - this needs to be turned off here: iTerm2->Preferences > Advanced > (Goto the Session heading) > Allow sessions to survive logging out and back in.\nAlternatively you can use this pam_reattach module to retain the session feature and TouchID sudo at the same time.\n\n\nA: To wrap up Andy and Glenjamin's solution into one play:\n---\n- hosts: localhost\n  tasks:\n  - name: install pam_reattach pam module\n    homebrew:\n      name: pam-reattach\n      state: present\n    register: reattach_result\n\n  - name: detect touch id support\n    shell: pgrep ControlStrip\n    ignore_errors: true\n    register: touch_id_result\n\n  - name: enable touch id for sudo commands\n    lineinfile:\n      path: /etc/pam.d/sudo\n      line: 'auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so'\n      insertbefore: '^auth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so$'\n    become: yes\n    when: touch_id_result.rc == 0 and touch_id_result.stdout != ''\n\n  - name: enable persistent touch id for tmux and iterm\n    lineinfile:\n      path: /etc/pam.d/sudo\n      line: 'auth       optional       pam_reattach.so'\n      insertbefore: '^auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so$'\n    become: yes\n    when: reattach_result == 0\n\nThis can be run with just ansible-playbook sudo-touchid.yml, where sudo-touchid.yml is what I named this play.\nThe first step installs Fabian's pam_reattach, which allows sudo to work in iTerm, tmux, etc.\nThe second checks to see if this Mac has a touchbar; otherwise we're going to bail out.\nThird, we're seeing if we already added pam_tid.so to /etc/pam.d/sudo, and only if there is a touchbar.\nFinally, we also add pam_reattach.so as an optional auth method. According to the author, he might have have some unknown bug, and if we used required it could result in a lockout.\n\nA: I created the following ansible tasks to enable touch id for sudo commands if your computer supports it:\n- name: detect touch id support\n  shell: pgrep ControlStrip\n  ignore_errors: true\n  register: touch_id_result\n\n- name: enable touch id for sudo commands\n  lineinfile:\n    path: /etc/pam.d/sudo\n    line: 'auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so'\n    insertbefore: '^auth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so$'\n  become: yes\n  when: touch_id_result.rc == 0 and touch_id_result.stdout != ''\n\n\nA: To allow TouchID on your Mac to authenticate you for sudo access instead of a password you need to do the following.\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n\n*Switch to the root user with sudo su -\n\n\n*Edit the /etc/pam.d/sudo file with a command-line editor such as vim or nano\n\n\n*The contents of this file should look like one of the following examples:\n\n*\n\n*\n# sudo: auth account password session\nauth       required       pam_opendirectory.so\naccount    required       pam_permit.so\npassword   required       pam_deny.so\nsession    required       pam_permit.so\n\n\n\n*\n# sudo: auth account password session\nauth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so\nauth       required       pam_opendirectory.so\naccount    required       pam_permit.so\npassword   required       pam_deny.so\nsession    required       pam_permit.so\n\n\n\n\n\n*You need to add an additional auth line to the top so it now looks like this:\n# sudo: auth account password session\nauth       sufficient     pam_tid.so\nauth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so\nauth       required       pam_opendirectory.so\naccount    required       pam_permit.so\npassword   required       pam_deny.so\nsession    required       pam_permit.so\n\n\n\n*Save the file. (Note: this file is normally read-only so saving your changes may require you to force the save, e.g. vim will require you to use wq! when saving)\n\n\n*Also note that pam_smartcard.so may not be present on older MacOS versions.\n\n\n*Exit from the root user or start a new terminal session.\n\n\n*Try to use sudo, and you should be prompted to authenticate with TouchID as shown below.\n\n\n\n*If you click 'Cancel,' you can just enter your password at the terminal prompt. If you click 'Use Password' you can enter your password in the dialog box.\n\n\n*If you SSH into your machine it will fall back to just use your password, since you can't send your TouchID fingerprints over SSH.\nNote:\nSee answer by user Pierz below if you're using iTerm, as there's a setting you need to explicitly change to enable this feature.\nNote:\nRecent MacOS updates may remove the entry. If TouchID stops working for sudo then check if the entry was removed and add it back in, following these instructions again.\n\nA: *\n\n*TouchID does support elevating privileges, but as of now, it only seems to be supported in Apple's own apps. My guess is that 3rd party apps will have to be updated to support it, unfortunately. I still end up typing in my password a lot.\n\n*See @conorgriffin's answer for instructions to enable TouchID for sudo.\n\nA: My 1 string answer:\nsudo su root -c 'chmod +w /etc/pam.d/sudo && echo \"auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so\\n$(cat /etc/pam.d/sudo)\" > /etc/pam.d/sudo && chmod -w /etc/pam.d/sudo'\n\nWhat does a command do?\n\n*\n\n*First, I indicate that I want to do everything from root (using\nsudo, the trick will not work (more precisely, it will, but more\ndifficult to implement)\n\n*Then I give write permissions to\n/etc/pam.d/sudo\n\n*Then I add the line auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so to\nthe beginning of the file. See that post\n\n*Then I take away the\ngranted write permissions /etc/pam.d/sudo , taking\ninto account Matin ZD remarks\nP.S.\nWhile experimenting broke sudo and su in the terminal, it is repaired like this\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012 enable root\nsu - root\nvim /etc/pam.d/sudo\n\nRevert the file to its original state\n\nA: I have created a simple script that enables sudo to use the TouchID PAM module exactly as conorgriffin explains. It does it in a single script that you can copy-paste to a terminal in it's entirety or use the \"curl pipe bash\" shortcut:\ncurl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/RichardBronosky/31660eb4b0f0ba5e673b9bc3c9148a70/raw/touchid_sudo.sh | bash\nThe complete script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash \n\n# curl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/RichardBronosky/31660eb4b0f0ba5e673b9bc3c9148a70/raw/touchid_sudo.sh | bash\n# This script is ready to copy-paste in whole, or just the line above (without the leading #)\n\n# Use TouchID for sudo on modern MacBook Pro machines\n# This script adds a single line to the top of the PAM configuration for sudo\n# See: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/259093/41827 for more info.\n\ntouchid_sudo(){\n  sudo bash -eu <<'EOF'\n  file=/etc/pam.d/sudo\n  # A backup file will be created with the pattern /etc/pam.d/.sudo.1\n  # (where 1 is the number of backups, so that rerunning this doesn't make you lose your original)\n  file_dir=\"$(dirname \"$file\")\"\n  file_name=\"$(basename \"$file\")\"\n  mapfile -t backup_list < <( ls -A \"$file_dir\"/{,.}\"$file_name\"* 2>/dev/null )\n  backup_count=\"${#backup_list[@]}\"\n  backup_ext=\"$backup_count\"\n  backup=\"$file_dir/.$file_name.$backup_ext\"\n  cp \"$file\" \"$backup\" 2>/dev/null || touch \"$file\" \"$backup\"\n\n  awk -v is_done='pam_tid' -v rule='auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so' '\n  {\n    # $1 is the first field\n    # !~ means \"does not match pattern\"\n    if($1 !~ /^#.*/){\n      line_number_not_counting_comments++\n    }\n    # $0 is the whole line\n    if(line_number_not_counting_comments==1 && $0 !~ is_done){\n      print rule\n    }\n    print\n  }' > $file < $backup\nEOF\n}\n\ntouchid_sudo\n\nThis script demonstrates a few cool patterns that I love to teach people who are new to bash or DevOps.\n\n*\n\n*Create a backup file that is numbered rather than simply .bak on the end.

That way if the download is interrupted, nothing is (partially) done.\n\n*Put a call to sudo bash -eu in your script so that you don't have tell the user to do it. (-eu are short for errexit and nounset and you should be using them!)\n\n*Single quoting bash heredoc 'EOF' to prevent premature shell expansion.\n\n*Making inline awk more readable.\n\n\nA: You can use fingerprint for getting sudo access in the terminal or iTerm, just add auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so to the first line to your /etc/pam.d/sudo file.\n\nA: This one-liner will insert the auth line described here as the second line of the sudo config file (so that it appears first after the comment line).\nsudo sed -i -- '2s/^/auth sufficient pam_tid.so\\n/' /etc/pam.d/sudo\n\n\nA: Here's a Gist to make it as simple as possible.\nhttps://gist.github.com/fraune/0831edc01fa89f46ce43b8bbc3761ac7\n\nA: One thing to mention is that you should first change the file permission then try to make changes:\nsudo su -\nchmod u+w /etc/pam.d/sudo\n\nAdding this line at first line:\n# sudo: auth account password session\nauth       sufficient     pam_tid.so # << Add this here ;)\nauth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so\nauth       required       pam_opendirectory.so\naccount    required       pam_permit.so\npassword   required       pam_deny.so\nsession    required       pam_permit.so\n\nThen revert it back file permissions when you are done with:\nchmod u-w /etc/pam.d/sudo\n", "Q: How to tell generation of Intel processor of Macs on Apple's website? I'm trying to understand if both the non-touch bar and touch bar versions of Apple's new MacBook Pros have the same generation of processor inside, but Apple does not seem to list generation of processor on it's website under tech specs (which is very misleading because based on the clock speed and i5/i7 listing, it makes it look as if it's last generation MacBook Pros have better processors than its newest machines).\nI notice that the non-touch bar MacBook Pro has slower RAM, but I'm not sure if this is because it's using an older processor or not.\nHow can I get better technical details on the MacBook Pro processors (such as the generation) without having the MacBook in hand?\n\nA: I'd check out other resources, such as EveryMac: http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/index-macbookpro.html\nAlthough the details aren't there yet, they will be shortly, and they include the full CPU specs you're looking for.\nWikipedia also has details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Technical_specifications_4\nUnclear what their source is though.\n\nA: They are using Skylake Processors according to C|Net.\n\nOne of the biggest updates are the processors. Apple jumped from using\n  Intel Haswell processors to Skylake.\n\nIn another post, C|Net explains why the 2016 MBP and the Surface aren't getting the latest and greatest Kaby Lake but rather sticking with Skylake\nThis is also confirmed by Macworld.com:\n\nThe major changes are internal, so let’s focus on those.

On Linux file manager, I think Dolphin (not sure right now, sorry) I can open Konsole just hitting F4. I would like to have the same on MacOS/Finder, openning Terminal instead. Is it possible?\nI'm on El Captain.\n\nA: I use Go2Shell for that purpose. It's a free app which can be added to Finder.

As one depletes, I insert the next one. They all look identical except for the serial number, so it's helpful to make a note of which one is spent or not. I'd like a simple app where I can list the three, e.g., \n\n\n*\n\n*EZXXXXX\n\n*TYXXXXX \n\n*FLXXXXX\n\n\nWith on/off switches next to them, so I can toggle and see at a glance which is spent.

It turned out that there was an (invisible to me) space at the end of the filename \"testfile.py \", which was causing the headache. i removed that, and all was fine again.\n\nA: The error that you see is just a security measure of macOS because you probably downloaded some source code from the internet, to compile, of which 'Makefile' is a part of. It's just asking you to be careful and be sure that it is not a malware.\nTo remove this warning, execute the following command in Terminal on the folder where the code is:\nsudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/folder/where/code/is\nThe 'com.apple.quarantine' is a metadata that macOS adds to files downloaded from the internet. This triggers the warning in macOS. Executing the above command removes this metadata from the folder and all files inside it, and thus macOS will henceforth treat all the files as normal (or \"safe / trusted\").\n", "Q: Are Thunderbolt/USB Type C in Late-2016 Macbook Pros compatible with non-Apple devices? The new Late-2016 Macbook Pros (with Touch Bar and Touch ID) apparently have Thunderbolt 3 connectors masquerading under USB Type C. I didn't pay attention how Thunderbolt 2 showed up, but I know that the original Thunderbolt appeared as Mini DisplayPort.\nWith Mini DisplayPort (and Mini-DVI before that) it was frustrating to be somewhere and find that lacking the miniature cable interfacing with VGA/DVI/HDMI, one could not connect to the local projector.\nWhat is the status of compatibility of Thunderbolt 3/USB Type C in the new Macbook Pros? Can one even interface with a generic SD memory card reader?\n\nA: USB Type-C is a specification for a plug connector. Thunderbolt is a specification for a transfer protocol.\nThe original Thunderbolt, in mockups prior to its final specification, showed a USB Type-A connector being used. The USB Implementers Forum refused to allow the USB Type-A specification to be used as a combination port, so the Mini DisplayPort connector was used instead. Thunderbolt 2 used the same connector.\nThe link from the Wikipedia article you linked, to \"Thunderbolt Alternate Mode\" (being an alternate from a USB transfer specification), explains that Thunderbolt 3 uses USB Type-C connectors.\nThe port is not masquerading as anything: Because both Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C devices use the USB Type-C connector, all devices that have USB Type-C connectors and that have macOS drivers, or that can operate using drivers built into macOS, are compatible with the port, as are all Thunderbolt 3 devices (ditto regarding the drivers). Thunderbolt 1/2 devices are compatible through use of an adapter, as are USB devices that have a Type-A, Type-B, Micro-A, Micro-B, or Mini-B connector.\n", "Q: iTunes fails to sync with iPod Touch, suggests I should reset it to factory defaults I'm unable to perform a backup from my iPod Touch to iTunes because it says it's failing to read data from it and that I have to reset it to factory defaults. This will erase all data on the device.\nI have, however, over 2000 songs on it that I don't want to lose, and thousands of contacts that I'd rather not lose as well. I tried to backup them with PodTrans but it gives me the same bad news that the device's database is corrupted.\nFrom the device's side though, all is well and it's working normally.\nThe device was working fine with iTunes until it was halfway through a backup and now it won't sync again.\nI've tried several different cables with no success, it doesn't seem to be a cable issue.\nI've tried rebooting and restarting iTunes background processes several times with no success.\nIs there anything else I can try to save my data from this device?\n\nA: Can you tell us what version of iOS you're running? Unless it's really old, you can sync contacts to your iCloud account, and if you go to iCloud.com and log in with your Apple ID you'd see them. You can also do an iCloud backup. Regarding songs, how did you get them on your iPod initially? If they were already on your computer then you should be able to put them back again after the restore. If you purchased them through iTunes you should be able to re-download them for free.\n", "Q: Airdrop w/o cellular and internet I read that Airdrop will work without internet access. Will Airdrop work without access to a cellular network?

Anyone know where it is? Or if I can? This isn't just calls it's anytime.\n\nA: The proximity sensor next to the front camera/speaker engages when it believes the device is being held to your face. Holding your finger over it causes the same effect.\nThere is no way to disable the proxmity sensor.\n\nA: In this case, it was just a bug. All you need to do to fix this is to restart your iPhone and it should be fixed. Thanks to Apple support.\n\nA: Maybe turn off facial recognition because the proximity sensor won't be looking for your face.

I've put rw permission on it for all users, but the only way that I can write to it is by having an account with admin privileges use sudo to edit it. It claims to be 'locked' in TextEdit, and I don't have the permission to unlock it.\nHere is it ls -l@ entry:\n-rw-rw-rw-@ 1 thelma  staff  15424 Oct 28 12:47 addresses\n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot     50 \n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot     50 \n\n\nA: A \"Locked\" file is a different situation than file permissions and who owns it and can write to it. It's actually locked for everyone including the owner. \nThis will require admin privileges\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to finder\n\n*locate the file.\n\n*select it and right click then choose \"get info\" or cmd+i (with it selected)\n\n*Uncheck the \"locked\" option.\n\n\nIf this isn't the actual issue then permissions are wrong and need changed.\nEDIT: Apologies for the delay in editing! Been rather busy!\ntldr; Perhaps you are not a member of the group associate with the file.\nI tested this with a file myself. I navigated into /Users/Shared (Capital S for shared, this is wrong in your question heading, just to ensure correct directory), and then made a file with:\ntouch test-file-permissions\n\nThis created a file named test-file-permissions with group assess of wheel, and administrator group. This was the outcome:\n-rw-r--r--  1 MyCurrentUserName wheel  0 Nov  3 19:00 test-permissions\n\nFrom here I was able to both use Nano, a terminal editor to edit the file and sublime text without sudo(GUI and terminal editors can make a difference for example: when editing the /etc/sudoers file it must be done by a terminal editor and command visudo).\nI then changed the file permissions for group ownership and permissions with editing writes still in my abilities and no problems.\nNote: We have two commands here. chmod and chown.\nchown -- change file owner and group\n\nAND\nchmod -- change file modes or Access Control Lists\n\nUsing chmod I tested personal rights to the file without group permissions, and then even changed which groups had ownership with no problems with requiring sudo to change the file. I didn't need it, simply put.\nNote: TheGroupNameIChangedTo is a group on my machine. I, the user account, must be a member of this group, in which case I am.\nDon't know your groups?

Your two user accounts, Admin and Standard must be a member of the same group. A solution would be to create one named whatever you like that doesn't conflict with existing, and add both users to it DO NOT ADD STANDARD USER TO WHEEL GROUP FOR SECURITY PURPOSES, ALTHOUGH THIS WILL SOLVE IT IN A WAY, IT POSSES A RISK .. I emphasize this because I understand and actually applaud with your two account system here separating Admin and Standard users. This is very smart!\nUpdate me if this is what you want/needed, I'll keep peeking in on the question. My answer may be a bit out of the way, but I wanted to cover everything for you and others viewing the question. I'm open to edits from viewers. All else aside, it'll still get edited later for clarity.\n\nA: I have fixed it. Apparently, the file carried extra extended attributes and ACL stuff that needed to be removed. I used the instructions in the link below to remove them and now I can again write to my own file.\nThese instructions clear an entire folder, but I could use them for a file, too\n http://garote.livejournal.com/249703.html\n\n", "Q: Does Touch Bar support background / system wide applications? Say for example I want to use Touch Bar for time tracking, or todo list application. It'd be super useful to have something that's always there no matter which application I'm viewing. \n\nA: The Touch Bar is not meant to show background and/or system wide notifications.\nApple has put out a document called macOS Human Interface Guidelines which is intended to communicate to developers how UI elements should be implemented; there's a section specifically about how the touch bar should function.\nUnder the Design for the Touch Bar Section, it provides guidelines as to how the Touch Bar should be utilized within the context of an App.\n\nDesign a contextual experience. Make the Touch Bar relevant to the current context on the main screen. Identify the different contexts\n  within your app, and consider how you can expose varying levels of\n  functionality based on how your app is used.\n\nAnd more specifically to your question, because \"background/system wide applications\" would provide notifications and it's UI and to the screen (via  Notifications most likely), not through the keyboard:\n\nUse the Touch Bar as an extension of the keyboard and trackpad, not as a display. Although technically it’s a screen, the Touch Bar\n  functions as an input device, not a secondary display. The user may\n  glance at the Touch Bar to locate or use a control, but their primary\n  focus is the main screen. The Touch Bar shouldn’t display alerts,\n  messages, scrolling content, static content, or anything else that\n  commands the user’s attention or distracts from their work on the main\n  screen.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nA: Apple's developer API reference for NSTouchBar explicitly states how the contents of the Touch Bar are determined (emphasis mine):\n\nOn supported MacBook Pro models, the Touch Bar, above the keyboard, shows instances of the NSTouchBar class from the front-most app.\n\nmacOS itself regulates what is shown on the Touch Bar at what time, and as noted above, this changes when the front-most app does.\n", "Q: How do I stop devices that are not on my network from appearing in the list of Airplay targets? I basically have no trouble seeing my own devices but I also see devices that aren't on my network in the list.\nHow can I get those AppleTVs that are not on my network to not show up?\n\nThis image is the devices that should appear (are actually connected to my network):\n\nI'll go to click one of those two which are always in the menu immediately, but since the list is populated asynchronously (there appears to be some extra discoverability step) another one will appear and invariably cause me to click the wrong device in the menu.\n\n...sometimes multiple times...\n\n\nA: So I've discovered that this is a function of Bluetooth and disabling Bluetooth stops the behavior.\nUnfortunately Bluetooth is kind of useful, so I'm still interested in other methods.\n", "Q: iPhone - cancel 'swipe to upgrade'? I recently had to restore a backup of my iPhone and when I booted it up it the only screen I can get is 'swipe to upgrade'.\nI'd really love to avoid upgrading past my current software version at the moment, does anyone know if there's a way to cancel the upgrade?\nThanks in advance for your advice :)\n\nA: You simply can't. Sorry this is kinda too short to be an answer, but it is.\nApple stops signing older software short after the release of a new version.\n\nAs of Wednesday Apple is no longer signing iOS 9.3.5, effectively\n  preventing anyone already on iOS 10 from downgrading to iOS 9.\n\nSource: Apple Insider\n\nA: Well, it's the darndest thing but I'm on iOS 9.3.5 after successfully doing a restore! I didn't think this was possible if you had the 'swipe to upgrade' screen happen.\nIf anyone else happens to be in this situation, the only thing I did out of the usual was reset the phone when it attempted to run the upgrade on the load bar screen, then put it into DFU mode and connect it to iTunes.

The projector is typically off and the Mac mostly works headless. \nThis setup has worked for me for a couple of years now. Ever since I upgraded to Sierra (10.12.3), I get only a black screen with the mouse pointer being visible though.

Can anyone help me find a better solution, please? My guess is the GPU has to be force enabled somehow, e.g. in bash...\n\nA: These are solutions that I found but that do not work for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*UPDATE: The issue finally and miraculously disappeared after  updating to macOS 10.12.4.\n\n*If you run third party applications, such as AirParrot or f.lux, you should try completely uninstalling those, as discussed here. \n\n*If your mac is 100% headless (i.e. no screen attached), you can either add an HDMI dongle or hack your own Thunderbolt dongle using a VGA adapter. This is a common trick to activate the GPU and comes with the added benefit that Screen Sharing gets much faster.

There's nothing you can enable that turns on Turbo Boost.\nFrom Intel's Website for the i7-640M Processor found in the 17\" Mid 2010 MacBook Pro:\n\nIntel® Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's\n  frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom\n  to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy\n  efficiency when you don’t.\n\nThis applies to all computers with Intel processors with the Turbo Boost technology, not just MacBooks.\nIntel's Turbo Boost Technology Note: \n\nIntel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 allows the processor to operate at a\n  power level that is higher than its TDP configuration and data sheet\n  specified power for short durations to maximize performance.\n\n", "Q: App Install Button 'Grayed Out' in iTunes 12 I'm trying to install new apps on iPhone 4S via iTunes 12. Music, info, photos are no problem, but iTunes will not allow me to install apps I have downloaded on my Mac via the App Store. All new apps have their respective \"Install\" button 'grayed out'. I have had no problems up to this point installing new apps. I have changed nothing on either the Mac or the device. All of the apps I want to install are free. Over 2 GB of free space in device.\n\nA: Without knowing the actual apps you're trying to install and what version of iOS you're running on your iPhone 4S, any answer you get is likely to be at best an educated guess.\nThere are a number of possibilities for your situation, but my first thought is that although you say nothing has changed on your Mac or iPhone, that doesn't mean something else hasn't changed. \nSpecifically, what I'm thinking is that many software developers are busy updating apps at present due to a number of updates (e.g. iOS 10, Xcode 8.1, Swift 3, etc). In doing so, many apps may become incompatible with older hardware and/or operating systems.\nIn your case you've downloaded the apps on your Mac, so there's no built in check going on as to compatibility. What I mean by this is that browsing/downloading the apps via the App Store on your iPhone will only allow you to download versions of apps that will install on your device, but there's no way for this to happen via the Mac as you could be downloading them for any number of devices.\nAnother factor is that your model of iPhone cannot run a version of iOS later than 9.3.5, so any apps requiring a more recent version will not install (and that's assuming you're even running iOS 9 (many iPhone 4S owners aren't).\nYou'd be best to use your iPhone to download apps as many developers (me included) do allow older versions of their apps to remain on the App Store for superseded devices etc.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: My Chrome on Mac (with Mac OS Sierra) always starts with feed.snowbitt.com when I run it I always get redirected to site feed.snowbitt.com when I run my Chrome.

It should look like this:\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nI'm running OSX 10.11.6 (El Capitan), and I've enabled the SSH server in System Preferences.\nI'm using putty as a client on my Windows machine. When I use the same putty configuration to connect to a Linux server, the locale information is fine.\nWhen I run a local terminal on the OSX machine, locale is fine. If I then ssh localhost, I have the same problem: no locale is set.\nIt seems that my OSX SSH server is ignoring or discarding the locale information from the client. I have the following in my (unmodified) /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nAcceptEnv LANG LC_*\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, that's all that's required.\nMy putty configuration is sending TERM=xterm-256color, which is being honored; it's only the locale information that isn't working, and to reiterate, it happens when I ssh localhost from OSX to itself, so I don't think putty is the issue here.\nI will not accept answers that suggest setting the locale in my .profile; there are plenty of answers on here suggesting that, but it's a hack, not a solution.\n\nA: Turns out there were two problems here:\nFirst, PuTTY wasn't actually sending any locale information. Apparently the Linux servers were configuring the locale automatically, or based on TERM or something. I fixed PuTTY by configuring environment variables for it to send:\n\nSecond, I'm using MacPorts (updated question since this was missing in the original), and MacPorts ssh does not send locale variables. I can't imagine why MacPorts configures SSH this way, but I had to add the following to /opt/local/etc/ssh/ssh_config:\nHost *\n  SendEnv LANG LC_*\n\nThat really ought to be the default MacPorts config; it's the default on any standard Linux system, and it's even the default in OSX's own SSH. Figured out that MacPorts was part of the problem when SSH from Linux to OSX did set the locale.\nI've filed a ticket with MacPorts suggesting the default be changed.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra console search criteria Is there a way to filter the console by multiple criteria?\nI'd like to display only warnings and errors from the PHP log file.

I always had Automatic App Updates activated, and never touched the setting. I do not turn my iPhone off during the night, and do not activate night mode or power saving mode. Just Night Shift.\nAnyone else noticed this as well? Is there anything I could do?\nThanks,\n-M\n\nA: I think this may be happening to you for a number of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 10 has determined that you do not use the updating apps at that time of day, so it is updating them during use to be more efficient\n\n*iOS may also have determined that this time of day and network are when you have the fastest connection. \n\n*If you use Airplane Mode at night (for faster charging and no notifications), it can't update apps at night.\n\n*Or there's a software glitch.\n\n\nA: Background update is not working at all on iOS 10.x regardless what internet connection you have, charging status or hardware version.\nI am pretty sure Apple knows about it but does nothing because pushing updates costs a lot of money.\nI have about 100-200 apps, probably average is 40-50 but with billions pf devices you can easily imagine the bandwidth.\nI think that they will bring it back only for incremental updates of recently used apps. \n", "Q: What is deleted during a macOS reinstall? If I reinstall macOS via Recovery without wiping the disk beforehand, what exactly will be reinstalled, what will be deleted, what will be kept?\n\nA: Any modifications to the OS or apple applications will be removed. The OS and apple applications will be reinstalled. All your settings, files, 3rd party apps, etc. will be kept. It's just like installing an update.\n\nA: In the past - Apple had three methods to install:\n\n\n*\n\n*erase and install (now deprecated)\n\n*archive + install + migrate\n\n*upgrade install (now deprecated)\nNow, when you run the installer - it is always archive, install, migrate. SO the existing system folder isn't touched (it gets archived) and a new system folder and library are created on the drive.\nSo some folders get erased entirely, some have modification scripts and most user folders don't change. The user folders might get a light script run to clean known issues, but in general - the things in the user home folder are left alone.\nThe system then reboots into the newly functioning system to run further installations and then kicks off the migration script. That script is responsible for the infamous \"about a second\" step where it actually goes over each user folder and migrates all the apps, settings and checks for known incompatible software and packages so they can be disabled before any user logs in to the newly made system. The whole process usually takes 5 to 25 minutes for the system tasks and then the last user step can take a few moments or a few hours in my experience. Past an hour, it is usually hung and you might need to do an erase / migration from backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*How long can I expect my system to be unusable during an upgrade to OS X Lion?\nThe old system is then deleted unless the script detects a potential that it will be needed or the migration failed in some manner.\nI you wan to do an erase instal, you need to erase the drive using internet recovery, target disk mode or similar and then run an installer on a blank volume.\n", "Q: Screenshot on my mac without permission?

Sending a message to \"yourself\" (i.e. your other devices) is done exactly how you would send a message to anyone else. Start a new conversation in Messages, then enter your phone number or email address, whatever's associated with your Apple ID, as the recipient.

I note the question How can I pause the download on Mac App Store and then resume it later? saying that downloads can be paused in Launchpad. However, my Mac (macOS 10.12.1) has started to download an update automatically. I can see that in the Activity Monitor, where the storedownloadd is top of the network received bytes listing. And, now I notice it, I see the Launchpad icon in the dock is showing a download bar, \"1.05GB of 1.54 GB\", but right-clicking it gives me no pause option. It's probably the Xcode update, since that is listed as due and they are typically GBytes. Launchpad shows no Xcode icon, and no other icon in Launchpad shows downloading. Right-click of the app store icon in the dock doesn't give me a pause option. The updates screen in the app store doesn't seem to offer a pause option.\nHow do I pause a Mac app store automatic update in Sierra, please? I need to stop the Mac using all my network bandwidth for the next few hours.\n\nA: Open System Preferences and you'll find an item App Store there.\nDisable the \"Download newly available updates in the background\" option. This way your Mac will still let you know when new updates are available, but it will not download them automatically.\n\nA: In an automated update, the Mac App Store Update page initially shows buttons labelled Update against each app which is due for an update. However, one of these has already started updating. But it doesn't say which one. I guessed which app had started updating, and hit the Update button for that app in the Mac App Store update page. I then waited a long time - many minutes - for the Mac App Store page to refresh. When it did eventually refresh, it gave me a download bar for the auto-updating app, saying that a GByte had already downloaded, and the Update button had turned into a Pause button. I then had to hit that twice, but it did eventually pause the download.\n", "Q: macOS did not apply new time zone settings I live in Turkey and recently Turkish government has opted out of Daylight Saving system, locking the country's time zone into UTC+3 permanently.

Worst case if attaching the MacBook Pro to the devices would require me to use all four of USB-C ports.\nGiven the answers up to far, I can tell that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Daisy chaining might or might not work with the MacBook Pro (since it requires DP1.2 which is supported by the graphics chipset, but it's uncertain if it's supported by the MacBook Pro itself)\n\n*I can attach the monitors with two cables as a last resort, leaving me with two ports for the remaining peripherals.\n\n\nWhat I still don't know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Would daisy chaining work with a hub or does it require the first monitor to be directly attached to the MacBook Pro?\n\n*Does some kind of hub exist supporting attachment of all listed devices with a single upstream connection to the MacBook Pro?\n\n\nA: Okay, after some further research, I want to share my findings.\nIs it possible to have a single-connected hub to which all monitors (DP or HDMI) and peripherals are connected?\nApparently not. I have not found any product which supports more then one DisplayPort or more then one HDMI port. In fact I was unable to find any hub or dock that supports more then one display device via HDMI or DisplayPort.\nBut there is such a device, if one display has a native USB-C port and the other display has a DisplayPort. Then one can go with the Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock which seems to be the only device supporting two display devices, but with the said constraints.\nWhich options do I have?\nSo that leaves me with the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*buying a DP-monitor and a USB-C monitor (while for the latter there is not so much to choose of, in fact I'm only quiet certain about the LG Ultrafine display promoted by apple) and the above mentioned hub.\n\n*buy any USB-C hub \"with power delivery\" and a HDMI-port; use this for the first screen and the peripherals, and connect the other screen with a fitting adapter (e.g. usb-c to hdmi, usb-c to displayport)\n\n*buy an arbitrary USB-C hub for the the peripherals, use fitting adapters for both display devices and (unless the chosen usb-c hub is \"with power delivery\") use the last port for power supplying the macbook.\n\n\nUSB-C hub with power delivery\nThere are several USB-C hubs out there with at least one HDMI-port and which are connected to the macbook via one USB-C port and are able to supply the macbook with power. Those hubs are labelled as \"USB-C hub with power delivery\". Unfortunately some of them are only said to support mirroring, so support of screen expansion is uncertain.\nA hub that does support it does seem to be the best bet, since those hubs are reasonably priced, one can basically choose of every available display on the market and a maximum of two ports need to be plugged into the macbook to connect the devices in my question (five).\nOne such device is a HooToo deivce, which - together with a standard HDMI-cable and a USB 3.1 to displayport cable - should do the trick.\nWhat about daisy chaining?\nAs said by a commenter, it's not really sure that ne Macbook supports daisychaining, but even if: Apparently there are not usb-c hubs with support for DisplayPort and even then it would be unclear if this combination would work with daisychaining.\n\nA: We have a brand new Late 2016 Macbook Pro and 2 Apple/LG 21.5 USB-C 4K monitors. Daisy-chaining/MST does not work. We are using the monitors and nothing else with the original cables.\nOnly way to get it to work is to connect each to individual USB-C ports on the MBP.\nSad but true.\n\nA: After doing a little research on Dell's daisy chaining monitors, I came across this bit of info on their support site:\n\nMulti-Stream Transport (MST), also known as Daisy Chaining, is a new\n  connection specification that allows multiple monitors to be connected\n  in series with the video signal being passed from the computer to a\n  monitor, and then from the first monitor on to the second monitor and\n  so on. This differs from the traditional configuration of having a\n  separate video cable run from the graphics adapter to each monitor in\n  parallel. This simplifies the video wiring in most situations, but\n  does have some specific configuration requirements to enable it.\n\n\n\nDaisy chaining monitors is supported in the Display Port (DP) 1.2\n  specification....\n\nI've been searching Apple's specs page on the new MacBook Pro's and I haven't found anything that specifically states they support the Display Port 1.2 spec.  Though the Intel HD Graphics (15\" MBP) supports it as does the Intel Iris Graphics 550 (13\" MBP).\nSo, there's no reason why it can't be supported, but at present, I don't know of anyone who can test this. However, what you would need if DP daisy chaining is supported is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Qty 1 Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort cable (Mac to 1st monitor)\n\n*Qty 1 DisplayPort to DisplayPort (1st monitor to 2nd monitor)\n\n\nIf daisy chaining is not supported then you just need Qty 2 of the first item and then you just plug it into two separate ports\nAs noted in the comments, this has been tested and found that Apple doesn't support MST daisy chaining.  Therefore, the only two options at this time is to use 2 direct TB to DP cables (first option above) or daisy chain the monitors with a third TB device (like storage) between the two monitors if you have that OS requirement.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this answers the question but I'm testing this out right now with a new MacBook Pro Touchbar 13\" with 4 USB-C ports. \nIn the testing I'm using the Minix Neo C Hub which has\n\n\n*\n\n*2x USB3 - Type A ports\n\n*Gigabit Ethernet\n\n*SD Card Reader\n\n*HDMI\n\n*Another USB-C that you can use for your power adapter\n\n\nI'm able to get two monitors working, one through HDMI on the Minix (Dell U2415) and one through DisplayPort (Dell U3014) using a USB-C to DisplayPort cable. I CAN daisy chain from the Dell U2415 to another Dell U2415 for 3 monitors but they will only mirror and not extend the display. \nFrom what I've read, it's a MacOS limitation and not a hardware limitation. Evidently, if you bootcamp into Windows you can daisy chain on DP 1.2 with no problem. \nI started typing this and then got sidetracked with a bunch of things so hopefully this is coherent.\n\nA: I am working on this same problem, although I plan to get the two-port MBP. There are several USB-C to DP adapters, that supposedly support MST, however, as it was mentioned already, it is not currently clear whether the MBP itself supports MST, let alone whether it will support it in a combination with some adapters.\nTherefore my current conclusion is to get two of Apple's own USB-C Digital AV hubs with HDMI - this should provide two USB ports, two HDMI ports and allow me to use one of them for the power supply. I've read some comments that the USB-C in these hubs can only be used for power, not data, which would preclude using them for other USB-C devices, but at least it's only two cables to plug in every morning upon arrival in the office...\nThe above is a rather expensive solution, at €59 for each of the adapters, but at least, in theory, they shouldn't ruin the USB-C ports on the MBP itself, as some of the knock-off cheap cables are rumoured to do.\n\nA: Thank you for posting your findings, I have the same questions and daisy chain would also be a great answer for my dual dell monitors. If its not confirm I´m going with option number 2:\n\"buy any USB-C hub \"with power delivery\" and a HDMI-port; use this for the first screen and the peripherals, and connect the other screen with a fitting adapter (e.g. usb-c to hdmi, usb-c to displayport)\"\nWith the twist of using dell da200 adaptar that has a ethernet port, and using the charger on the 3rd usb-c providing a cheaper solution.\nthe da200 adapter works -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY2o0ZpA-6E\n\nA: the new Apple macbook with USB C ports will connect ONLY to thunderbolt equipped screens.

For me it works only with an Apple thunderbolt screen (apple display), but not to an old iMac 27 (has mini-display, same plug but not a thunderbolt) or any of my Dells including a 4k... Daisy chaining will not work either as the first screen will not work.... The common mistake is to confound a mini display with a thunderbolt.... The type of screen which you can hook are very limited (the new LG sold by apple for example, or the old apple display, which is not a 4k or 5k. Beware beware....\n\nA: Interested where this goes, my MBP is coming soon and I would love to be able to daisy chain... \nOWC supports hdmi and usb-c, so could you not connect both at the same time and then if the monitor has usb-c daisy chain, connect other monitors to the monitor too?\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/shop/usb-c/owc/usb-c-dock\nOther option is \nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/belkin-debuts-thunderbolt-3-express-dock-hd/\nUsing traditional TB to daisy chain... my current 2013 MBP tapped out at 2 daisy chained TB displays but maybe the new one will be able to push 3?\n", "Q: How to remove Calendar event without the sender's notification Today I got an event request from a \"fake ray ban\" scammer/seller for my iCloud calendar. The calendar is shared/synced with my iPhone via iCloud.\nUnfortunately, when I pressed delete, the calendar popup told me that deleting the event means also I'll decline it and the sender will be notified.\nI want to remove the event without notifying the sender, because the event is sent to many other generated email addresses and I don't want confirm my address by declining the event.\nThis is a very serious Calendar privacy problem. If there isn't an simple solution it is enough reason for me stopping using Apple's calendar.\nSo, how do I remove the event from my notebook's calendar, my iCloud-synced iPhone's calendar, without notifying the sender?\n\nA: I had a similar issue but with a repeating event sent in Chinese script. The event repeated every day indefinitely and there was no option to delete without sending a delete confirmation to the Sender.\nA bit of digging revealed that this is likely an invite sent directly to the iCloud calendar. \nTo try to stop this I have set that calendar invite to \"Email\" (you need to do this on the web icloud calendar options Setting>Preferences>Advanced>Invitations>EmailTo). Hopefully, nothing will be inserted into my calendar now without me accepting.\nTo remove the offending event,  I created a Spam calendar on iCloud Calendar on the Web, moved the event to the Spam Calendar (on my mac), then deleted the Spam calendar (again, on the Mac). \nEverything now seems to be in order.\n\nA: I found this free workaround over on Superuser.\nBasically, you disable networking, delete the event, then delete the notification from email:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off networking on your Mac\n\n*Delete the event from iCal\n\n*Wait for the notification to show up in your Outbox\n\n*Delete email from Outbox\n\n*Turn back on networking\n\n\nOnce networking is back on, the sync will remove the other events from iCloud and your phone.\nEchoing Jaime Santa Cruz's comment below, you should definitely block the sender.  You have already confirmed your email because it (probably) already sent a notification that you accepted; best to be safe and not sorry.\nAs to your second question, \"...it is enough reason for me stopping using the insecure Apple's calendar?\" it would generate too much opinion to go into.\nThat said, I personally use Office365 Exchange Online ($48 for the year), Outlook.com, OneDrive and Azure for my cloud services with my iMac, MacBook Pro, XServe and (soon) a refurbished Mac Pro.

Set this to Default (it's actually faster, smoother & more crisp in MacOS like that too as it's pixel perfect not scaled).\n\n", "Q: Backup verification canceled due to thermal pressure After a Time Machine backup, a verification kicked off:\n\n2016-10-29 23:47:35.736819-0500  localhost backupd[198]: (TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine.TMLogInfo] Checking for runtime corruption on /dev/disk5s2\n  2016-10-29 23:47:36.450339-0500  localhost backupd[198]: (TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine.TMLogInfo] Verifying backup disk image.\n  2016-10-30 09:18:16.815734-0500  localhost backupd[198]: (TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine.TMLogInfo] Backup verification canceled due to thermal pressure.\n  2016-10-30 09:18:17.167520-0500  localhost backupd[198]: (TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine.TMLogInfo] Backup verification skipped during fsck.\n  2016-10-30 09:19:01.016411-0500  localhost backupd[198]: (TimeMachine [com.apple.TimeMachine.TMLogError] Backup verification incomplete!\n\nMy problem is I want the verification to complete. The error is Backup verification incomplete!. \nDoes this mean that my Mac overheated or is it memory pressure or something similar? \n\nA: Thermal pressure comes and goes. Unless your verification cannot complete after a week of attempts, I wouldn't worry about that specific error.\nHowever, this is some cool technology to manage variable workloads on Mac hardware that integrates with Intel chipset power management for multiple core and variable clock rate CPU. If you don't mind using the command line - open terminal and type:\npmset -g thermlog\n\nThen you can watch as you run some programs that use the CPU to see the various warnings come and go. Basically the OS will schedule the kernel_task to \"soak\" CPU and idle the system to keep the thermal heat generation from overwhelming the cooling method.\nOn my MacBook - there is no blower or fan, so the thermal throttling lets the conduction of heat from the CPU / GPU to move out to the frame. Sometimes I have to remember get my Mac up off a thick conformer / blanket (which insulates the case) or open the display when I run it attached to a USB-C display in closed clamshell mode. More air past the frame = better heat dissipation. The keyboard area can also let off a lot of heat when the closed screen (thin layer of glass and air - a nice greenhouse) is causing thermal pressure on the CPU during a movie render or long compile cycle that uses all the cores.\nOther Macs with active cooling, the blowers will speed up in response to thermal events. Once they can no longer turn faster, the same CPU throttling will take place.\n", "Q: Scroll with mouse in 'less' without clearing the screen When viewing a long file in Terminal with less (or man, which uses less internally), I can use two-finger gesture to scroll up and down the file; it's great. But less on OS X has an annoying problem: When I quit, it resets the screen back to what it looked like before I started less. \n% date\nSun 30 Oct 2016 16:18:23 CET\n% man less\n% (hmm... where did my output go?)\n\nWhen I quit I want to see the next prompt appear below the last screenful I was viewing in less. I can achieve this by using less -X or setting LESS=-X, which suppresses the terminal initialization sequences. Unfortunately, -X also turns off the mouse-scrolling feature. Is there a way to suppress the screen clearing but still be able to scroll with the trackpad? \nAs I understand it, this would require using a different set of terminfo settings. I cannot make heads or tails of the whole terminfo infrastructure. Does anyone have a solution? I'm on El Capitan, in case it makes any difference.\n\nA: This question is nearly identical to a question asked on SuperUser. Here's a portion of the answer:\n\nSo there you are: Either you switch to alternate screen and the terminal's hack converts scroll events into keypresses for less, and the normal screen is restored when you quit; or you don't, and then there can't be any magic converting scroll events to keypresses and less doesn't understand the scroll events.\nSo what could be done? Well, either implement mouse support in less and let it handle scroll events itself (and live with a nondefault click or copy-paste behavior), or implement another weird hack: upon quitting, after reverting to the normal screen, less could for the last time print a screenful of content, repeating whatever was displayed before you quit.\n\n", "Q: I can t find my internal HDD drive (part of fusion drive) on iMac 27 late 2012 Hello as I wrote on the title I have an issue with my fusion drive ..

Here is the photo also from my diskutil list and diskutil cs list :\n\n\nBefore that I took a messages twice that the disk you inserted was not readable by this computer .. This is the reason I entered Internet Recovery mode ..\n\nA: It could be a hardware failure. You could test that by installing the OS in recovery mode to an external drive (USB/FireWire/Thunderbolt are all supported for booting) and then seeing if you can wipe both the HDD and SSD or set up Fusion Drive again.\nThis delays spending time and money on a repair tech.

I'm not sure what caused it, but have read that iOS would free spaces when needed. That means, the free space we see in the settings is actually not accurate. There are some disk cleaning apps and should \"force\" iOS free the spaces. I am using an app called \"memory & disk scanner pro\", and it can do the job. You may try it or some other similar apps.\n\nA: I had the same issue on the iPhone 5s and iOS 10.1.1.\nTried every space cleanup tip/hack,\nRemoved all the unused applications,\nCleared caches,\nRemoved pictures, videos and music.\nStill I was always back at \"Zero KB\" of available internal storage.\nBut when I connected the phone to iTunes (which I rarely do) to get the storage allocation by category  I noticed most of the sapce was getting eaten up by the Other category has reached 9.7GB (out of 16GB theoretical capacity).\nI also got the prompt saying an update to 10.1.1 was available but it couldn't update anyways as 600MB of free space was needed.\nI started thinking I had a bad update on my phone or corrupted iOS.\nI found this article on the Apple Support page\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7467540?language=en said I might need to clear all data/settings then restore from a backup if the Other category is taking more than 2GB of space.\nI followed this process https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201274 to clear everything and restore from an iTunes backup.\nIssue fixed!\nAfter restoring the backup and reinstalling the 10.1.1 update I now had 9,54GB of available storage.\n", "Q: Indexing NAS with \"mdutil -i on\" with Sierra not working anymore I used to index my NAS with the command line mdutil -i on.

I know macs can be picky about how much their max memory capacity is, so what is the maximum RAM I can install in my two available memory slots?\nModel:  Early 2011 MacBook Pro 13-inch 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 \n\n \nCan I put in 16GB with 8GB in each slot?\nAccording to the Apple support, my specific model can officialy take 8gb, 4 on each slot. But many people say that we can put double the official, is this true?\n\n**EDIT: It works, and I wrote an article about this whole process here **\n\n\nA: Yes.You can install and use 16GB of RAM in that machine. There are several discussions in Apple's forum on this subject.\nI Have same same model MBP and upgraded two weeks ago. Works great.\n\nEdit: (as to the comments)\nThis is the product I have purchased to my mac. Please, before you buy make sure that the memory fit your specific mac model. Apple  do have a good webpage of How to identify my mac model.\nHere, you can find a similar discussion in iFixit forum\nIn my original answer I have mentioned SSD. Thanks to @tubedogg clarification, the SSD and RAM are unrelated in this discussion. Yet, when upgrading considering to upgrade the SSD is not a bad idea. \nSorry for the bad analogy: it is like replacing parts in your car that will make it runs great, but it takes 15 minutes to start it.\nFor me, I decided to start with RAM. Upgrading the Hard Drive, made it even better.\nI didn't see the Mac going over 8MB yet, so I opened every application on my mac just to get to 51%. Since the update it usually runs between 30%-45% of RAM used.\nWhich brings me to the following conclusion: \n\n\n*\n\n*Can You install 16MB RAM? Yes\n\n*Do you need it? depends on your usage\n\n*Why would you still install it? Upgrade once, even if you don't use it right away\n\n*Should you also upgrade your hard drive? If you have the resources (money, time, transfer method), then yes \n\n\nA: According to Everymac.com your particular model can support up to 16GB of RAM1\nSo, as to your question, \"Can I put in 16GB with 8GB in each slot?\"\nYes.  That's exactly how you can upgrade your memory to 16GB.  You will need one \"16GB kit\" which is two 8GB modules of PC3-10600 memory.\n\n1 Everymac.com:  Apple officially supports a maximum of 8 GB of RAM, but as first confirmed by site sponsor OWC, this model actually is capable of using up to 16 GB of RAM with two 8 GB memory modules.\n\nA: While Apple Tech Specs states 8 GB RAM, nonetheless, yes you can use 16 GB RAM.\nHere are two examples of supported RAM for your model.\n\n\n*\n\n*Crucial 16GB Kit (2 x 8GB) DDR3L-1333 SODIMM Memory for Mac\n\n*OWC Upgrades for MacBook Pro 2011\n\nA: If you press the Memory upgrade information button in that window, it would take you to an Apple page stating the maximum memory is (I think) 8 GB, 4GB per slot. I have a Late 2011 13\" MBP which I upgraded to 8 GB of RAM and it works fine.\nHowever, I have heard of people who went past the max and put in 16 GB of RAM and it worked out. It's not officially supported though so it might not work or it might not work properly. You can always try it if you really need the RAM and are feeling adventurous.\n\nA: Just upgraded my MacBook Pro Late 2011 with 2.4 i5. PNY 2x8GB 1600mHz from Best Buy for $74. System profiler shows 1600 too. So I'm guessing it didn't down clock it to 1333 like it was originally with the 2x2GB modules. \n", "Q: Can't open app in macOS Sierra I've recently downloaded an app. I can confirm it worked in OS X El Capitan, but it doesn't open anymore in macOS. When opening the app, I basically get a pop-up saying that the app is not supported with my version of macOS. I can confirm it is not a PowerPC application. I tried opening the app via Terminal. When trying that, I get the following result.\n; exit;\nobjc[674]: Objective-C garbage collection is no longer supported.\nAbort trap: 6\nlogout\nSaving session...\n...copying shared history...\n...saving history...truncating history files...\n...completed.\nDeleting expired sessions...none found.\n\nIs it still possible to open the app using another method? If not, could someone explain me why?\n\nA: I'm afraid the garbage collection feature of Objective-C was deprecated back in 10.8 in favor of Automatic Reference Counting or ARC. Now with the release of Sierra, this feature appears to be officially obsolete. Most likely this means the feature was completely removed from the Objective-C runtime, so there is no way to continue to run old applications that depend on this feature.\nThe application will need to be updated to the new ARC system to work on the newest versions of OS X. Alternately I suppose you could run it in a VM with an older OS X version.\n", "Q: Sim not supported on unlocked device I have an Apple iPhone 6 A1586 from the US which was a replacement device from Apple, but the previous handset would've been locked to TMobile (always GSM and never CDMA I believe).\nI've inserted a new UK (GSM) SIM into the device and it's telling me the SIM is unsupported.

The website says I need a \"stronger password\", but I meet all their requirements. I don't want to make a new password, how can I keep the old one?\n\nA: According to Apple, the Apple ID password (which should be the same as your iCloud account and password) must:\n\nContain at least eight characters, a number, an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter. \n  You can't use spaces, the same character three times in a row, your Apple ID, or a password you've used in the last year.\n\nIf you have uppercase and lowercase letters and a number in your old password, and if there are no repeating characters and not any other restrictions mentioned above, that should be fine. Is that the case? However, if you change the password, it cannot be to a password you have already been using within the last year.\nThe question is, why is it making you change your password? It's not because the password is too weak. Did you initiate the change? Do they think your account is compromised? Did you try logging in too many times or accidentally press \"forgot my password\"? Was this totally out of the blue? Do you have any more information about that? If you do have to make a new password, you do have to Make it different from the old one. It's not a bad thing to change your password once in a while, though I understand it can be annoying to get used to a new password and to update your login on all your Apple devices and apps. I remember a few months ago I had to change my iCloud/Apple ID password. I don't recall why or if I initiated the change or Apple thought my account was compromised or if it was out of the blue, but I did have to change it, and it was a mild inconvenience updating my logins.\n", "Q: Upgrading Mavericks --> Sierra I just tried to upgrade my OS from Mavericks to Sierra.\nThe app store shows that I have installed Sierra (see pic), but \"about this mac\" and the command line both say I still have 10.9.5 (Mavericks).\nAm I missing a step?  Or is this a bug and how do I solve it?\n\n\nA: This is a slightly confusing Apple UI-fail.\nSince Allan is partly or basically correct: \n\nYou downloaded it. You didn't install it.

What does that mean?\n  – user2429920 Oct 31 '16 at 4:04\n\nYour picture displays \"installed\" for Sierra, alright.\nYou need to combine Allan's comment with the contents of this comment:      \n\nThe name of the app is \"Install macOS Sierra.app\" or\n  something along those lines – NoahL Oct 31 '16 at 4:16\n\nThat means: Your AppStore application has successfully installed the \"Install macOS Sierra.app\". That info is pictured in the banner you posted: you downloaded the installer completely and the installer is therefore marked as installed.\nTo actually install that new system as the system running your machine (\"upgrade to Sierra\") you indeed need to open the newly installed \"Install macOS Sierra.app\" in your Applications-folder. That will then guide you through the actual install after which your system will boot into Sierra.\n", "Q: Downloading unsigned applications Using MacOS Sierra, I have downloaded an unsigned app from a website.  When I open it, my security settings prevent me from running the app (it is from an unknown developer), but I can open it from the Security panel in Systems Preferences.

While Messages for macOS allows for the deletion of individual photos from a conversation, the photos are not deleted on other iMessage clients so they have to be deleted off of each client that was open at the time. This is a problem when my girlfriend decides to text me risqué photos over the weekend and I left Messages running on my work machine. I guess I have some careful deleting to do tomorrow!\nAnyway, I am unable to find out how to delete a photo from a conversation on iOS Messages at all. Is it even possible? The only way to do it appears to be to delete the entire conversation which I do not want to do. Anyone have any clues?\n\nA: Go into the conversation on your iOS device (assuming iOS10). In the top right corner you should see an information symbol (\"i\" in a circle). Click on it. Then scroll down to the picture you want to delete. Then tap and hold the picture. Three options will come up: copy, delete, more. Select delete. If you're using an iPhone 6s or newer, be careful not to force touch the image instead of tapping and holding.\n\nA: iMessage operates like SMS or old-school email, not like webmail or FB messenger where what you're viewing is basically a real-time mirror of the server. Once a message has been delivered to your devices the server is done with it, so no, there are no take-backs of the way you're hoping for.\nBasically, tell your girlfriend to send you sensitive stuff through another medium in the future.\n", "Q: Bulk update information in Photos.app? Is there a better way to update the photo metadata for pictures in the Photo.app rather than hitting \"Get Info\" on every single photo, such as weill a clever app or something? My goal is to add tags to my all of photos.\n\nA: Get Info still works when selecting multiple photos (and only touches the fields you change so you won't accidentally overwrite stuff), and both shift and cmd do what you'd expect as far as selecting goes - same as iTunes basically. Plenty fast in my opinion.\nFor proper bulk library things (merging several massive libraries, etc) something like PowerPhotos is what you'd have to go with, though.\n", "Q: Use iPad socket adapter with MacBook Pro charger I have an iPad. Can I use its socket adapter (the part of the charger the connects to the socket) in my MacBook Pro charger \n\nA: Yes.\n\nThe socket adapter of iPad and Macbook Pro have the same standard:(2.5A 250V~).\nSo they are interchangeable.\n", "Q: Chrome cant show image when using cellular data. but working fine when using wifi i try to open my website where there is some function to get current location and show the image of my location.\nbut its only working when im using wifi data and when im using cellular data the image got blank.\nany suggest why this happen??\nits problem from my iphone or from my website??\n\nA: If other images work on your iPhone on cellular, the problem most probably is on your web site.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create an invisible rule in Mail? I'd like to apply a mail filtering rule within Mail without it appearing in the rules list. Is there any way to make this happen, either from within, or from outside the app?\n\nA: No you cannot do that within Mail.app.\nHowever you can add for example a mail filtering proxy that sits between your mail provider and Mail.app. This proxy will be able to filter away mail without Mail.app displaying that it does so. Depending on your mail provider it might also be able to move mail into subfolders, etc. (for example this is possible on IMAP).\n", "Q: Is there any documentation on the macOS Sierra new logging system? I've been trying to diagnose a problem with a MacBook that won't NetBoot off my Mac Mini server running MacOS X Server 5.2 and macOS Sierra. However it proved to be rather difficult when I came to actually looking at the server log files as aside from the server log they were totally empty, and the server log seemed to be lacking anything useful at all.\nAfter some digging around on the Apple site I came across this post which suggests that Apple have changed the logging system on macOS Sierra, and certainly following the instructions there I can find the logs, but they're still not viewable through the server app, and the official Apple server documentation still talks about logs going into the traditional log files.\nIs there any more detail or documentation anywhere on the new logging system, or how to get it to play nicely with the server application?\n\nA: Most of the logging that was being redirected into custom log files has defaulted back to the system log. As was mentioned in the post you referenced, the log command (man log) is the best way to access the information. \nFor netboot issues, looking at log messages from bootpd & tftp should give you useful info.\nlog stream --predicate  '(process == \"bootpd\") || (process == \"tftp\")' -info\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina (13-inch, 2015) keyboard and trackpad unresponsive As in the title.

Its somewhat irritating when I use multiple desktops and an empty one is created in between. How can I turn this feature off?\n\nA: You're simply confused as how to operate the system properly. When you think you're \"maximizing\" the window, you're really full-screening the application.\nIn order to \"maximize\" the window, you'll need to hold down the Alt-key while clicking the green \"+\" button in the top left corner of the Chrome window.\nYou can also maximize windows through other means - such as through an application such as SizeUp! or similar.\n", "Q: stop iOS contact importing contact info from mail footers I recently changed from using the gmail app to the native iOS mail app on my iphone. \nNow when i search for a contact in the address book to make a phone call it seems to have pulled in a load of contact info from peoples email footers, i have some email accounts for work that i dont want to clutter up my contact book, is it possible to only set the 'search emails for contact info' setting to only apply to select email accounts ? \n\nA: It's not available per-account, but the setting is adjusted in iOS 10 in Settings > Contacts.

I'm looking for something efficient, i.e. having a long battery time and with the most refill. \nWhat kind of characterstics/quality factors do I need to look for while searching for a replacement?\n\nA: There are a number of different battery manufacturers out there; the problem with figuring out which one is the better of all the others is you never know which one will perform and which one won't.\nPretty much all will have the correct specs and will connect to your device whether that be a MacBook Pro, an alarm system or a back up UPS.  What I have found in my many years of experience is to go with the vendor that offers the best warranty.\nGenerally speaking when I went \"cheap\" I ended up having to replace the battery much sooner than expected.  If I spent a little more on a battery with an 18 month or 24 month warranty, I usually got 3-5 years out of it which is the norm for me.\nEgoway and Lizone are two batteries that I would recommend as replacements for your particular MacBook Pro.\nReplacing them is pretty simple too.  You basically remove the 10 scews on the back and remove the back cover to expose the logic board and battery.  Remove the battery connector from the logic board (on the right) and pull the battery up by the tab.  Just reverse the steps to install the new one.  \nThe pictures below give an abridged version of this procedure, but you can find the full detailed instructions on iFixit.com\n\n\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro strange display issues Last week my Macbook Pro from 2012 suddenly had a display issue.

It appears as if it recalculated all the awards in the new timezone, and now they were credited on Monday morning, because the European Sunday night happens to be Japanese Monday morning.  It did however not remove the Awards that were credited on Sundays, leading to a huge increase in awards.\nI possess my Apple Watch since March, for about 35 weeks that is.  In that time I have no gathered a total of 24 perfect move weeks, 30 perfect exercise weeks, 57(!) perfect stand weeks, and 30 (yes, more than 24) \"all perfect\" weeks.

During watch mac unlocking setup, iPhone prompts for laptop user password, but iOS security guide (last updated at May 2016) does not describes, how that password will be used.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does iPhone needs it only for initial iPhone-Mac-Watch tethering, or maybe it saves password and uses it for every unlock?\n\n*Does it send password (encrypted or not) to iCloud services?\n\n*Do I have to provide new password to iPhone and Watch after I'll change it on Mac?\n\n\nA: Apple has now transitioned much of the “enter your iCloud password” to be “enter the password for device X” for unlocking the keys in the keychain.\n\nThe rest of this answer is likely out of date, but was the best I knew in 2016.\nI've tested most of your scenarios and don't believe the password ever leaves the Mac. Instead, Apple builds up a cryptographic key pair to sign packet exchange between the watch and the computer with anti-replay aspects and time of flight calculations to ensure the watch is really sending the packets now in real time before the unlock happens.\nThe anti-replay means that you can't record those packets and then play them later to unlock the Mac. Basically Apple leverages the iCloud security that is set up for two-factor authentication and keychain syncing to exchange the cryptographic keys needed to sign the data to establish a verified signal and prevent hacking into your Mac with a synthetic or bogus signal.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206995\nThe iOS 10 security guide is not out yet nor is the watchOS 3 guide.

I am now wondering if it is possible to go back to OSX or Windows? \nCurrently when I hold option key on boot, I get a grey screen and only wifi connection settings are shown. \n\nA: If you wish to go back to Mac OS permanently, you might be able to restore from the OS X recovery partition if that is still present; hold Command-R while starting up to try and enter Recovery mode. See the short instructions from Apple, or this MacWorld article for a longer description. Please note that some of these options may delete your Ubuntu installation and any files in that OS.\nIf you departed from your linked tutorial and completely wiped the hard disk to install Ubuntu, the Internet Recovery mode--also described in both links above--may still work. (In fact, the Mac might have been showing you that WiFi connections screen because it's attempting to get to the internet for that purpose.) \nIf you want to preserve your dual-boot setup, try repairing the EFI bootloader by reinstalling rEFInd from inside Ubuntu. The process should be very similar to the instructions in your tutorial for installing rEFInd within OS X, as rEFInd's install script is stated to run within either.\n\nA: To get back to a native OSX install do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold option on boot \n\n*Select \"Internet Recovery\"\n\n*Open Disk Utility and format the Disk back to Mac Journaled\n\n*Restore from previous timemachine backup or reinstall osx\n\n", "Q: iTunes: auto ramping up/down to avoid dead air As a simple solution to avoid dead air, I'd like to overlap each pair of consecutive songs in a playlist by ramping them down/up.\nIn effect this would be a poor man's DJ solution.\nI wouldn't mind if it's entirely non-interactive, just so long as it is suitable for dinner parties, dance events, and the like. Indeed, the DJ software applications on the app store all seem to require an operator. Does an automatic solution exist, one that takes no more input than: 1. playlist, and 2. duration of overlap ?\n\nA: There is also a trimming function within iTunes that works separately from the crossfade solution proposed by @timothymh. This would work better for your dance scenario. If you right-click a song and select Get Info, you get an info window about the song. Under the Options tab, you can set a start and stop point for each song.\nAs an example, here I've set this song to start 20 seconds from the beginning.\n\n\nA: In iTunes playback preferences (iTunes menu > Preferences… > Playback), you can toggle crossfading, and set it to take anywhere from 1 to 12 seconds.\n\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone select a random song when I connect my headphones? Like many other people, I listen to music on my iPhone (6S, iOS 10.0.2) on my way to work. Since the update to iOS 10, I have noticed the following annoying behavior:\nWhen I plug my headphones into my phone, the \"Music\" app selects a random song from my collection and wants to play that. It doesn't start playing it, but shows the song in the lock screen, waiting for me to press the Play button. I find this really annoying because I would expect to still be at the song that I was listening to last.\nIs there a way to change this behavior to my expected behavior (the song I last listened to is selected when I insert my headphones)? From what I remember, that was the default behavior in iOS 9.\n\nA: This bug was introduced in iOS 10, and the same thing happens when you ask Siri to “play music,” or even if you pull up the Control Center’s playback controls.\nIf you Pause, then Resume only a short while later, the app remembers where you were. But leave it be for an hour or two, and it will forget. At that point it will try to shuffle your entire library when you start music playback.\nIf you open the Music app, it will suddenly remember which song or playlist you were playing last, and you can Play from there.\nUntil Apple fixes it, I’m afraid that’s the only workaround.\nEdit: I haven’t encountered this issue since iOS 10.1.1.\n", "Q: Does the Power Nap support the purchased apps download? Does the Power Nap downloads the just purchased App Store apps? I am expecting it so as stated in this Apple Support Document - How Power Nap works on your Mac. \nBut, I think I misunderstood it because when I have clicked Install below the Xcode icon in App Store which initiated the download, when the download is at 800MB I have plugged in my MBP-RD-2015, closed the lid, opened it after 30 min and disappointed to see the download is still at 800MB. \nI have verified that in settings power nap is checked while plugged in and on battery (I have enabled it before). Does  Power Nap support purchased apps download or does it only supports downloading of updates in App Store?\n\nA: I think the key to when/how App Store downloads are process is, according to the link you provided,\n\nMac App Store downloads are checked once a week.\n\nYou didn't give it enough time.\nThe way power nap works is that \"Sleep\" takes priority.  If you want to put your MB to sleep now for whatever reason (say, you are going into a meeting), it doesn't make sense for your MB to say \"no, I think I will continue downloading\"  \nThere is a \"schedule\" or a time interval when your MB will wake.  Once per hour to do something small like check mail or your calendar.  Once per day for updates (bigger activity) and once per week for pending downloads.  \nTo check for these things, it has to come out of sleep \"half way\" - meaning enough to turn on networking and your drive, but not enough to bring up your full GUI and related services.  If your MB is going to be checking and downloading continually as opposed to the schedule, then it's not going to sleep; which defeats the purpose of putting it to sleep.\n\nA: I don't know for sure if Power Nap specifically supports new downloads as opposed to updates, but I would expect it to work. However, if you only wait 30 minutes you're not going to see it kick in.  It takes longer than that for Power Nap to start working.  Does it work if you leave your Mac alone overnight?\n@patrix and @Deesbeck: I know that my first post might have been a little lacking in context, but I tried to answer the question!  I don't feel it merits the unfairly aggressive treatment you've given me.\n", "Q: MBP (late 2016) - 5.1 audio over USB-C? While I am waiting for my new MacBook Pro to arrive, I have started wondering how to connect everything together. My goal is to only have one cable to connect to the MacBook when I use it at home (which will be Thunderbolt 3 obviously). So I will probably get some sort of Tunderbolt-3 Dock with Displayport and Ethernet. \nHowever, I am wondering how I should handle audio: I have a 5.1 surround system which provides both digital  (optical toslink) and analog input (using three cinch cable for the different channels).\nI know that I should be able to plug in a toslink cable into the 3.5 audio jack of the MBP (if Apple hasn't decided to remove that feature?). However, I would like to only have one cable as mentioned above, so I need to get the audio over USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 somehow.\nIs this possible? What kinds of adapters would I need, so I can realize the following (basically I am looking for an adapter from TB3 or Displayport to Toslink (optical audio) or Digital Audio via Coax):\n-------------     --------------           ------------------\n-           -     -          DP==         ==TL              -\n-  MacBook  -     -  Dock      -    ???    -   AV-Receiver  -\n-           -     -            -    ???    -      (5.1)     -\n-        TB3=======TB3      TB3==         ==DA              -\n------------      --------------           ------------------\n\nTB3 = Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C\nDP = Displayport (regular size)\nTL = Optical Audio (Toslink)\nDA = Digital Audio (Coax)\n\n\nA: You can also try picking up a relatively cheap FireWire soundcard. They are usually produced for con- or prosumers and are of a relatively high quality. Picking one up second-hand should not be that expensive.\n\nA: For reference (what I did): I did not purchase a dock, but chose to plugin in two USB-C-connections: One for power and one for attaching the display (I used a USB-C to Displayport-Adapter from Aukey - the original Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 did not work for some reason). I figures out that I should be able to handle everything else using Wifi / Bluetooth.\nAnyway regarding audio: It turns out that the MBP 2016 with TouchBar does indeed output audio via Displayport. My monitor (Dell U2711) is able to receive the signal and forward it using analogue 5.1 (three cinch cables).\nNot sure if it helps anyone and whether the results are applicable to other situations, but in my setup this works without complaint.\n", "Q: Reopen windows when logging back in does not work I have just performed a fresh re-install of El Capitan on my MBP 2014 and have found that this setting is not working at all. When I log out, I leave the check box ticked (so I DO want to open all applications and  my open terminal sessions to be restored, which also used to always work). When I log back in, nothing is restored, and my previous terminal sessions are lost. So how do I fix this? In general settings, I have un-ticked \"Close windows when quitting an app\", but I'm not sure if this is related to logout issue.\n\nA: Well, all of the information for the restoration is kept in ~/Library/Saved Application State, so maybe looking there would lend a clue.  You should see a whole lot of folders ending in .savedState.\n", "Q: macOS updated to Beta despite opting out This morning I was surprised seeing that my Mac mini has updated to 10.12.2 (16C32e) beta although I did opt out under the System Preferences from receiving future beta updates .\nI am an Enterprise Developer so I believe that this is part of the Developers Beta and not the Public Beta, I mainly develop on iOS and would rather keep working on a non-beta machine so that my development could go smoothly without any beta bumps.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Try using the following Terminal command to manually reset the Software Update catalog to the default end-user list:\nsudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog\n\nThis won't remove the current beta build from your Mac, but it should reset to the correct release version next time one comes out.\n", "Q: Is there someway to get a list of all missing photos from the photo library? I get the following error in Photos app on my Mac.\nMissing File\nPhotos with unavailable original files cannot be opened.\nThe original photo “IMG_3076.JPG” is either offline or cannot be found. Click “Find Original” to reconnect.\n\nI want to follow the instructions from how to avoid getting missing file error in photos, so my question now is, Is there some way to get all missing files from Photos library? It is going to be impossible to double click every photo to find out if it is missing. I need just the directories, i can place them back one by one and consolidate.\n\nA: Short answer: you can use the script in this GitHub repo.\nLong answer: \nI had the same question, and it turns out that the photo library is backed by a SQLite database under the covers. On your machine, you can find the database file at <photo library root>/database/photos.db. There's a table called RKMaster, with a row for every photo, and a fileIsReference column that tells you whether the photo is \"external\" or not.\nThe script I linked to simply dumps the list of all external files, and then iterates through to check that each one exists on disk.\nNote that the table also includes an isMissing column, but this is not good enough by itself.  It only tells you about the files that Photos \"knows\" are missing, because you tried to double-click them, or use them in some way.  If you simply delete a file from disk, but don't try to access it in Photos, the isMissing column will be false.\n\nA: If what you want is just a list of all missing files, you can get that using osxphotos with the command\nosxphotos query --missing\n\nThat will only give you the UUID of each file, not the path. However, once RepairPhotosBookmarks is integrated into OSXphotos (due shortly) you don't need the file path because that powerful app will be able to handle those missing files for you.\n\nA: I've found that the isMissing flag doesn't mean that the image is gone, just that it's not currently on disk.  Using the Python script here, I was trying to copy all of my images out of Photos for backup. I noticed that several images were not being copied, and it turned out it was because they had the isMissing flag on them. But, I was able to take the image name (e.g., IMG_1234.JPG), search for it in Photos, and it found the image.  And when I opened the image in Photos for viewing, there was a progress circle shown in the lower right corner (as though it was loading the file from somewhere), and when I checked the folder inside the Photos library on disk, sure enough, the missing file was now there.\nSo now the mystery is, where are these \"missing\" files stored, and how do I access them (without having to visit each & every one within Photos)?\nAnd has anyone reverse engineered & documented the schema of the Photos SQLLite DB, including what the various fields mean, like \"isMissing\"?  I haven't been able to find it myself. \n\nA: (Note: The solution appears to only work if the Photos library has been converted from an older iPhoto library, and the images were missing already at that time. I leave it here for educational purpose, but have added another answer with a more thorough detection.)\nHere's an AppleScript that can add all images in Photos.app to a new album, from where you can then select and delete them (e.g. with cmd-delete).\nIt only works if Photos has already detected that the file is missing. I don't know what causes this detection, it's just that I found a Photos library where this was the case, and then this script worked. But when I tried to reproduce this with another library, where I deleted the original files (and also made sure they were not recreated, which happens when they came from iCloud), even relaunching Photos with forcing a library repair would not update the image properties to a state where my script would detect them as missing. Maybe this only works with libraries that were converted from former iPhoto libraries (which I know the first one was).\nTo use it, launch Photos, switch to view all photos, and select all photos you want checked, e.g. with cmd-A. Then run the script, and it'll add all those photos for which there's no known or accessible image file to the automatically created \"missing images\" album.\ntell application \"Photos\"\n    set media_items to selection\n    set missing_items to {}\n    repeat with media_item in media_items\n        if width of media_item is 0 then\n            set end of missing_items to media_item\n        end if\n    end repeat\n    if missing_items is {} then\n        display dialog \"Found no missing files\" buttons ¬\n            \"OK\" default button \"OK\"\n    else\n        if not (exists album \"missing images\") then\n            make new album named \"missing images\"\n        end if\n        set dest to album \"missing images\"\n        add missing_items to dest\n        display dialog \"Found \" & (count of missing_items) & ¬\n            \" missing files\" buttons \"OK\" default button \"OK\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nA: Note: The following solution, while working well in my own test case, is probably not suitable for large (100'000s) of images in the library, nor with Photos offloaded into iCloud. Take this as an educational answer but don't expect it to work in your case. I welcome others to improve on this script and post it in their own answers.\nThe following AppleScript parses the sqlite database to identify the paths to the files, then checks if those files are present. If it finds missing files, it then launches Photos.app and tries to identify the related images (or movies) and adds them to an album named \"missing images\".\nIt works with version 2 and 3 of the Photos library, tested with Photos.app v3.0 (on macOS 10.13 \"High Sierra\") and v7.0 (on macOS 12.6 \"Montery\").\nTo use this script, copy the code below and paste it into a new \"Script Editor.app\" document. If you only want to check particular images for missing files, open Photos, then select the items you want checked. Otherwise, to check all items (photos, movies), quit Photos. Then run the script. Once the script has checked all files, it will launch Photos and add the missing items to the album \"missing images\". When finished, it will show a message about it. Then you can view the album in Photos, select all items and delete them with cmd-delete if you want to get rid of them.\nBeware, though, that if you have some images on external media and those disks are not mounted, then they'll also be considered missing by this script – yet, you should probably not want to delete those items, then!\nuse scripting additions\n\nset path_to_photos_library to POSIX

Can I somehow reuse those cables or do I need new ones?\nApple's support page 1 lets me know that:\n\"Note that although it uses a Mini DisplayPort connector, the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn't support connections to Mini DisplayPort displays.\"\nSo I guess reusing the cables is not the way to go?\n\nA: I'm not sure why you would go from a Thunderbolt 3 connection to a Thunderbolt 2 to DisplayPort rather than go directly from Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort.\nA general rule of thumb in tech (and for many areas in everyday life) is reduce complexity to increase reliability.  The best (IMO) solution would be to go from native DisplayPort to DisplayPort.  \nThe Thunderbolt ports on the MacBook Pro actual have DisplayPort as a native signal (on a type C connector), so this Cable Matters USB-C to DisplayPort 4K  should fit the bill.\n\n\nA: I use Google branded USB Type-C to DisplayPort cable with a different model of 4K monitor. Using it, my late 2016 MacBook Pro drives the monitor at full 3840x2160 at 60Hz. No problems. If you can get that adapter, it simply works. I'd assume any other USB Type-C to DisplayPort 1.2 adapter rated to support 4K monitors at 60Hz should work too. The Apple branded adapter will not work at all, because it is not DisplayPort adapter. It is only Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter, if you need to connect an older device (such as RAID box).\nIf you want to connect two 4K monitors, you'd probably need two of those adapters. Daisy chaining two 4K monitors using DisplayPort (connecting to first monitor via adapter, then connect monitors to each other via DisplayPort cable) won't work well in general and won't work at all with Macs. AFAICT, DisplayPort 1.2 does not have enough bandwidth to drive two 4K monitors at 60Hz out of a single port, so daisy chaining type of configuration would work at only 30Hz refresh rate if it works at all. You'll find this documented in the manual for P2415Q. Additionally, Apple only supports daisy chaining Thunderbolt monitors, but not DisplayPort monitors (if you search Apple support forums, you'll find this info). Daisy chaining DisplayPort monitors works only with Windows (and probably Linux?). But due to low refresh rate (only 30Hz) you shouldn't do it with 4K monitors even if it worked with Macs. To drive both monitors at 4K at 60Hz you will need to connect each monitor directly to your computer (PC or Mac) using cable or adapter. I have not tested this with the new (late 2016) MacBook Pro myself, but in theory connecting each monitor to a separate output on the MacBook Pro should work.\nWhile at the topic, DisplayPort 1.2 does not have enough bandwidth to drive single 5K monitor at 60Hz either. All 5K monitors (all 3 or 4 of them), such as HP Z27q, use two DisplayPort cables to connect to computer (Mac Pro supports this dual-cabling of single monitor, not sure about MacBook Pro). I've no idea if you can drive one of those 5K monitors that require dual-cabling using two USB Type-C to DisplayPort adapters.\nThe only 5K monitor I know of currently that you can connect to anything using single cable is the flawed LG UltraFine 5K monitor, because it uses Thunderbolt 3 (not DisplayPort). But you don't want that monitor either. It has more flaws than you can shake a stick at; if you read reviews for it over at Apple's website, they are less than stellar. It's a shame, since in theory you could drive the monitor, charge your laptop and access USB hub in the monitor, all through single USB Type-C (well, Thunderbolt 3 really) port on your laptop.\nThe 24\" P2415Q (and other 21\" to 24\" 4K monitors) should probably be fine choice for a 4K monitor. I'd expect about retina-quality image. Would be definitely interested to hear back if you get that monitor. Make sure to set it to 2x scaling in Display Preferences (when you click \"scaled\", select setting where it says \"looks like 1920x1080\", that's half of 4K native horizontal and vertical resolution, i.e. scaled 2x). You can see this in this video over at Youtube. This will give you text size (fonts) and everything else about as you would expect on 24\" display (which are all generally 1920x1080, surprise, surprise). Except there should be no visible pixels, should be perfect smooth, like on displays Apple brands as \"retina\". You'll also see in the video a performance warning when he hovers over other scaling options that are not equivalent of 2x or 1x scaling (referenced below for 27\" and 32\" 4K monitors).\nFor any larger monitor (27\" or 32\") 4K is less than ideal (I'm using one of those currently). You'd need to set scaling to 1.5x (\"feels like 2560x1600\" or \"2560x1440\") to get things correctly scaled. Anything less and text will be too tiny, anything more and text will be way too large. The image on the screen will look way better than \"normal\" (non-4K) monitor of the same size. However with 1.5x scaling the performance may suffer as graphics hardware will have to work extra hard (in display preferences, you'll be warned when you chose that setting). Ideally you want to go 5K with 27\" and 32\" monitors, so that you can set scaling to 2x. That's why all \"retina\" 27\" displays are 5K. Unfortunately, the only 5K displays out there are the flawed 27\" LG UltraFine 5K (connects via single Thunderbolt 3 cable) and 2 or 3 models from couple other manufacturers that require connection via two DisplayPort cables. I so wished more 5K models would be announced at CES. Disappointed. Plus Dell discontinued the only 5K monitor they had.\nIn short, 4K on 27\" and 32\" monitors is neither here nor there. It's a compromise. With 1.5x scaling, it's still nicer looking text and graphics than regular monitors. But because of 1.5x scaling performance may suffer. Depending what you end up using monitor for, it may be good compromise, or not.\n", "Q: Is it required that I upgrade to Sierra Forgive me for what is probably a very silly question, but I just got my first Mac.  I used to use PCs with Ubuntu because my friends got me using it because I didn't like Windows 8.\nI'm not strong with computers, I didn't like Ubuntu and all the problems that i needed a expert to help with so I went to Apple.  \nNow some of my friends are telling me I must upgrade to sierra while others are saying to wait.  I like El Capitan because it's working well.  \nDo I have to upgrade?  Is it required?\n\nA: You're indeed not required to upgrade to Sierra and you can run El Capitan for years. But the upgrade is preferable because the new version can include new functionality, bug fixes, improved security etc.\nI have a bad experience with upgrading from Maverick to Yosemite (I upgraded as soon as possible), when the system was suddenly slower then before. It was better after few weeks when some updates were released. So my current strategy is to wait 2-3 months after the new Mac OS release until major problems are discovered and fixed, then upgrade.\n\nA: No, you are not required to upgrade to macOS 10.12, Sierra. While the upgrade is free, it is not compulsory.\nMany, including myself, recommend waiting before upgrading. This additional time after a major macOS launch gives time for problems and regressions to be discovered.\n\nA: it will eventually be, sooner or later, so i wouldn't delay, myself.\nOSX 10.9 is no longer receiving security updates:\nsupport.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\n\nhttp://www.computerworld.com/article/2950580/operating-systems/the-end-is-near-for-os-x-mountain-lion-support.html \nby the way, siri on mac is actually pretty good.\n\nA: If you don't need the new features of the latest macOS, and aren't troubled by any bugs in your current version that are fixed in the new version, you have no need to upgrade.\nHowever you should be aware that Apple generally support only the latest 2 - 3 versions of macOS (formerly OS X) with security updates, so in 1 - 2 years' time you may find your current OS is no longer updated to fix any security issues that may emerge. So you might want to consider upgrading before this happens.\nThe macOS App Store will only offer you an upgrade to the latest OS version, but you can download and keep the upgrade installer without installing the upgrade - just quit out of the installer rather than proceeding, and it will sit in your Applications folder until you choose to run it. By doing this you can keep the option open to upgrade to Sierra after the next version is released, should you decide that you'd rather not go to the latest one for some reason. Alternatively I believe an Apple Store can install a non-current version for you if you take your Mac in to them.\nIf you have a full bootable backup of your Mac on an external disk, using a program like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner, it's straightforward to restore your system to exactly how it was before the upgrade, so you can try the new OS out and revert if you hit a problem. Alternatively you can install the new version on the external disk and boot from that, although bear in mind when evaluating the new OS that running from an external drive will usually be slower than from the built-in storage - also make sure you have a separate backup, just in case newer versions of apps like iTunes or Photos modify data on your built-in drive such that the older version can no longer read it.\nI tried to find a definitive statement on the 2 - 3 version support cycle but it doesn't seem to be a published Apple policy, just the typical trend over the last few versions.\n", "Q: How can I change the calendar that an event, added from Mail, is attached to?

How can I resolve it? Thanks!\n\nA: ETA: Go to ivzwentp.tracfone.com and install the configuration profile. This fixed the problem for me. (That's what the text I got last week instructed me to do. I was able to find a copy of that text online, at a different site.)\n\nSame problem here, also on PagePlus. I've tried to chat with PagePlus customer service but have been unable to get through. I did get a weird text message last week about iPhone data issues on PagePlus - maybe that was related? I thought it was spam so I deleted it...\n\nA: I have finally got this working. As noted above, my problem initially was the opposite of the OP. I wanted to remove the cellular data (APN profile) when I travel, then restore it when I go back to the US. \nThere are two parts to the solution, each covered elsewhere in more detail. Here is how I put them together.\n\n\n*\n\n*If Tracfone/Verizon has pushed a profile onto your phone with iOS 11, it will be hidden and cannot be removed. You have to backup and then edit your backup with iBackupBot. (This is described elsewhere.) The simplest edit (and the only one that worked for me) is simply to remove the profile file. \n\"mobile/com.apple.managedCarrier.plist\" \nThen still using iBackupBot, you do a full restore including reboot. The result is a restore with all your data, etc. intact, but no profile installed. After I did this, my foreign SIM worked fine with cellular data. \n\n*Although I am not back in the US, I did go to the iphone.flexserve.net site where, as Aaron suggested above, I installed \"Straight Talk (tracfone.vzwe...)\" as my profile. Of course, my French cellular data immediately stopped working. However, in Settings, General, I now see the Profile and this one can be removed. I did that and Bingo, French cellular data is restored.\nUnfortunately, this is a solution for techies. The good news is that you only need to do the backup, delete profile from backup, and restore once. After that, you have an easy way to delete the profile and then reinstall it.\nI think it will be important to install the profile immediately on returning to the US, before Tracfone/Verizon pushes out another hidden profile. Then refuse all proposed carrier settings updates.\nAlso, who knows if this will keep working when there is another iOS update.\n\nA: For what it's worth, below is the email I got back from PagePlus technical support. Installing the configuration profile worked for me, but CAUTION, iOS says that the linked configuration profile is unsigned which means that we can't be confident that this is the exact file PagePlus intended us to download. Theoretically, a malicious hacker could swap it out with their own file, and do bad things to our phone once we install it.

Go to iphone.flexserve.net. Select APN & Proxy Changer, Enter your country, then for operator, select \"Straight Talk (tracfone.vzwe...)\", then click \"Generate Profile\" and install the profile. Turn your phone off and then back on. If that doesn't work, try Verizon (4G LTE) as the operator. \n\nA: I just followed Aaron's suggestion:\nGo to iphone.flexserve.net. Select APN & Proxy Changer, Enter your country, then for operator, select \"Straight Talk (tracfone.vzwe...)\",\nI wanted to add that I use Tracfone (over Verizon network), not Straight Talk, but this solution worked perfectly for me on an iPhone SE that a month or so ago had started having the problem: “Could not activate cellular data network”\n\nA: I have had this same issue on my iPhone SE.  I use tracfone and I bought a 200 minutes card yesterday.  It added the minutes and data and texts into my account but then my phone could not use data.  I had plenty of bars of signal and it showed Verizon LTE (I have the cdma tracfone card).  I had to call tracfone several times before someone there could help me but it is resolved now.  They had to update something and the rep asked me the MEID number and IMEI number from my phone plus my sim number.  It took about 30 minutes once I reached a person who knew how to fix this.  Also this has happened to me a couple times before.  I love having affordable service on an iPhone so I will continue to deal with this inconvenience.  Also I do NOT believe this is an issue with the gsm sims but the CDMA has much better signal strength where I live.  \n\nA: I had same issues but then found this out took me a week but now my data works go to https://iphone.flexserve.net and  select  Verizon  4g not tacfone profile and you should be able to use your data. \n\nA: This is what worked for me, which is a bit different than what's already posted:\nI did a full DFU mode restore to the latest firmware, set up the phone, factory resetted it (settings > general > reset > 2nd option from the top), set up the phone again, did a Cellular Data toggle first off then on (settings > cellular > cellular data OFF/ON), and finally the web started working. There was no need for any additional profile download, and it worked perfectly with both Verizon and PagePlus sim cards... your mileage may vary.\n\nA: I used these steps as suggested:\nI had same issues but then found this out took me a week but now my data works go to https://iphone.flexserve.net and select Verizon 4g not tacfone profile and you should be able to use your data.\n\nA: I also got the dreaded \"Could not activate cellular data network\" on an iPhone XS with iOS 14. I tried toggling Airplane mode, Cellular Data mode, restarting phone, reset network settings, none of those worked.\nWhat finally worked was to change the General > Cellular > Network Selection from Automatic to T-Mobile (or whatever your provider is). After that, the cellular data worked perfectly fine.\n\nA: I had the same problem in December and that is what Tracfone told me to do as well. It works. I will say I seem to have this issue every time I add data to my phone.\n\nA: Ok.  Here is how I fixed my no data problem with Tracfone and iphone 5se.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Put the Tracfone sim in an iphone that the data works in.  (Iphone 6 and above). Be sure the data is working in that newer phone.\n\n*Backup the newer phone on itunes.   \n\n*Re-set the phone and all settings on the iphone 5se.\n\n*Restore the iphone 5se with the back-up from the newer iphone.\n\n*Re-start the iphone 5se\n\n*Once the iphone 5se has been re-started, go into celluar settings and turn Cellular Data \"Off\" and then turn back \"On\".\n\n*Turn wifi off.  check to see if cellular data is working.

Click the name of the other device. It should look like this:\n\n4 - On top of your Finder window, look for \"Not Connected\" and \"Connect as\", which should look like this:\n\n5 - You will be prompted to type the ID and a password of the other computer. This is the tricky part, because you have to type the ID of the other computer exactly as it appears on the other computer.

If you're not sure what the exact spelling of the name of the other computer is, you can go in the other computer's Apple menu () and look for the \"Log out\" name, or go into the other computer's System Preferences then access the Users & Groups pane where you can also find it.\n\n6 - When you click on \"Connect\", you should see the shared folders of the other computer appear on your screen. Drag and drop the files you need to send on one of these folders, and the transfer should be much faster than Wi-Fi transfers.

This service provides support for web apps (alongside normal websites) through the use of webapp.plist(8) and webappctl.\n\nYou can define the web apps managed by webappctl by creating plist files and placing them in /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/webapps/. For information about these plist files, enter man webapp.plist in Terminal.\n\nhttps://help.apple.com/serverapp/mac/5.2/#/apd85e35fbb-8fc2-44ed-855f-bf4e67374de6\n", "Q: How to type pipe with the ABNT2 layout? I'm used to the ABNT2 brazilian portuguese layout, which is very nice for both programming and typing with accents, but my apple keyboard lacks keys that are standard for such layout, like one on the left of Z and a fourth on the right of M. As a result, slashes and question mark need extra work to type, namely pressing alt-q, alt-shift-q and alt-w. But nothing for pipe.\nSo I wondered how I could type a pipe without messing with ukelele as suggested here?\n\nA: You could set up a shortcut for it in system prefs/keyboard/text/replace with\nMinimum 2 characters I think.\n", "Q: Why does my finger buzz when I slowly move it near the trackpad? I've noticed that when I drag my finger around the trackpad (not actually on the trackpad) that I get a strange little vibration. Is the haptic engine responsible for this? and why does it do it?\n\nA: Normally this vibration sensation is due to the MacBook being plugged in. From personal experience my 2008 MacBook Pro does this when plugged in (Official Charger) and my 2012 MacBook Pro only does this when plugged into the college power (Official Charger) so cant say for sure as I don't have your specific MacBook but am confident this may be the answer.\nAs you stated with the haptic feed back this could be the answer as there could be a software bug causing the vibration to be stuck on but I can't help thinking this may not be the case.\n\nA: It is your charger not being grounded. You probably use the snap-on with only neutral and +, while the bundled cable also connects ground wire. For me this sensation occurs not only near the touchpad but anywhere on the metal surface of the laptop, even magsafe plug itself.\nIf you disconnect it from charging or use the bundled cable it will stop doing that. \n", "Q: How do I close Chats tabs in Skype for Business for Mac? On the Windows Skype for Business client, to the right of each tab there is an X that allows closing the tab so it no longer shows in the list.  I have not been able to find a way to close tabs in the Mac client, despite extensive searching.\n(It is possible to re-use exiting tabs when continuing to talk to someone, but if they start a new conversation with you or switch to a different device, it creates a new tab.  After using the client for one day, I have 5 tabs from one co-worker. I'd like to make the old ones go away.)\nOS X 10.11.6 / El Capitan and Skype for Business 16.0.3638\n\nA: I found that clicking the tab once selects the tab and moves the cursor to the chat box. A second click on the tab selects the tab, then you can press the delete key to delete the tab.\n\nA: Double-click.  It opens in another window.  Then you get the normal interactions.\n", "Q: What should I be using instead of `dig`? I stopped using nslookup a decade ago because dig superseded it. Now I'm creating custom files in /etc/resolver/ and finding that everything works... except dig (and nslookup).\nActually, I'd prefer to fix dig than to use something else. I write a lots of scripts that use those common tools. I don't like having to code 2 different solutions.\n\nA: How about host?\nThe host command is very similar to dig except it's much more simple and doesn't have the very technical info (if you don't need it).  So, for example, a host lookup would look something as follows:\n$ host apple.stackexchange.com\n\napple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.129.69\napple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.193.69\napple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.65.69\napple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.1.69\n\nYou can also specify which DNS server you want to use by adding it to the command:\n$ host apple.stackexchange.com 8.8.8.8\nUsing domain server:\nName: 8.8.8.8\nAddress: 8.8.8.8#53\nAliases:\n\napple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.193.69\napple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.129.69\napple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.1.69\napple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.65.69\n\nAnd if you absolutely need it, you can add -a to get the same output as a dig command:\n$ host -a apple.stackexchange.com 8.8.8.8\nTrying \"apple.stackexchange.com\"\nUsing domain server:\nName: 8.8.8.8\nAddress: 8.8.8.8#53\nAliases:\n\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 26262\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\n\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;apple.stackexchange.com.

But I forgot to duplicate the note. So I did remove most of my writings accidentally. Closed to app and when I went back on it I saw the disaster my work have been lost. \nIs there a place where we can go back in time and choosing a note from versioning like on Dropbox?\n\nA: Are you using Time Machine? If yes, open Finder, go to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/ and open Time Machine eg. from the icon in the top right. This should show you past versions of the files there. Close the notes app completely and try restoring files.\n\nA: iCloud only keeps backups of files in iCloud Drive, contacts, calendars, reminders and bookmarks.\nIf you have another device available which synchronises to the same iCloud account and may not have synchronised yet, turn Airplane Mode on from Control Center before unlocking the device and see if the content of the note is still there.\n", "Q: Create a standalone photo album I have one series of photos that I show to people I meet often. Using the iOS Photos app with an album is fine, except that it takes a while to launch and then find the right album, and sometimes that app is slow.\nWhat I'd like is to have an app (or an export process, or something) which allows me to select some photos maybe the first time I launch it, and then just displays those photos, and only those photos, when I start it up. I'd just like them to fill the screen and I could swipe between them.\nThen, I could just pop open my phone, launch that app, and be showing the photos immediately.\nDoes anyone have any good ideas?\n\nA: Create an iCloud Shared Album and give it a web URL, then \"bookmark\" that URL with a home screen icon.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Photos app and tap on the Shared tab.\n\n*If you don't see the + icon at the upper-left, tap \"< Sharing\" there.

Will lost mode goes into effect once the phone goes on? Are they able to see all my pics and data being that it was not password protected? \n\nA: If the phone ever gets an internet connection again it will go into effect, yes.\nHowever if your phone was stolen, you risk that the thief will wipe it and sell it off - probably as parts - and your lost mode setting will be for nothing.\nAs you have no pass code on the phone, they will be able to see all your pictures and data, yes.\n", "Q: How to make fullscreen windows appear next to the current space with \"...rearrange spaces based on recent use...\" disabled I keep a lot of apps running at the same time. I keep some apps in fullscreen next to the first desktop for general usage, and some other fullscreen apps next to a second desktop for \"work\" stuff.\nThe problem is that when I put an app in fullscreen it is placed next to the last space. I know that enabling \"Preferences > Mission Control > Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use\" would make apps to be placed next to the desktop I'm in, but I chose to disable it because I don't want spaces to move.\nI noticed that there's a (bad) workaround:\n- keep the green fullscreen button of an app clicked until it is presented the choice for placing it in the left or the right side of the screen;\n- release the mouse in order to assign the app to a side;\n- click anywhere on the side of the app; the app should now be fullscreen and should be placed in the next space (not at the end).\nIs there a way to keep that option disabled while at the same time be able to open apps in fullscreen directly next to the desktop I'm currently in?\n\nA: The workaround seems to have some unnecessary length. If one holds the green button, then clicks in the app itself, it will become fullscreen right away in the next space, not at the end. It is a two step process. Just like methods like this hypothetical one: Go to view menu -> \"Full screen in the next space, not the end\". Also the option about rearranging the spaces was turned off in my Mac.\nMacOS 10.14.5\nMacBook Air 2017\n\nA: Fastest way to do it today (October 21st, 2020) with macOS Catalina, is getting a custom keyboard shortcut to open it \"full screen\" to the left or right and select the window (this last with the mouse, there's no way to make a shortcut to it that I know, but window is big enough to not take long to select it):\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts / App Shortcuts\n\n*Click the '+' button (encircled in red in the pic):\n\n\n*On \"Menu Tittle\" add exactly what is inside the following quotation marks (or replace Left with Right if preferred): \"Tile Window to Left of Screen\".\n\n*Press the keyboard shortcut you want for it. As the shortcut for Full Screen is  Ctrl + Command + f, I'd recommend using Ctrl + Option + Command + f as it is the full screen that we are going to use (mainly or optionally) and it is is easy to type. Click Add.\n\nNow you can just use Ctrl + Option + Command + f and then click on the tiled window to make it a Full Screen next (right) to the desktop where you opened it.\nWant to put it back to the desktop it came from? Press Ctrl + Command + f (as for full screen) and it'll be right back.\nIt reduces the time from 5 to 1 or 2 secs. Surely less if animations are disabled.\nStill I'd rather have a direct kbd shortcut, hopefully Apple introduces it with Big Sur, but this makes it pretty usable at least.\n", "Q: Device Manager fails to start on a macOS Server 5.2 I have setup a working Open Directory Master on on Mac-Server-1 running macOS Sierra and macOS Server 5.2 (latest as of today).  I have also successfully started the Device Manager and enrolled a client computer with no problem.\nI have now also setup a working Open Directory Replica on Mac-Server-2 running MacOS Sierra and macOS Server 5.2.  However, when I try to activate the Device Manager on the Replica, it stays Disabled.\nIs this by design that Device Manager can only be active on the Master?

The file is an important system component of macOS which is responsible for starting all other programs. Basically without it you cannot boot your system.\nNormally this would mean that something has very seriously failed during the installation of macOS.\nI would suggest reinstalling macOS while paying very close attention to any error messages that popup during installation.\nIf problem persists, consider the possibility of a hardware error such as a disk failure.\n", "Q: Battery - Shut down or sleep an MBP For the lifetime of a battery, is it better to shut down or sleep an Mac book Pro? Could anyone be able to explicit a full answer to this question?\n\nA: There are two factors that govern the life of a battery:\n\n*\n\n*Age\n\n*Charge Cycles\n\nThe biggest factor is age. Math Finds Top Culprit as Lithium Batteries Age\n\n...a battery ages, or degrades, whether it is sitting on a shelf or\nin use. The main cause of lithium-ion battery aging is the continuous\nformation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in the\nbattery. The SEI layer must form for the battery to work because it\ncontrols the amount of chemical reactions that occur in the battery.\n\nThe next is cycle count. A complete discharge and recharge is one cycle. A 20% discharge 5 times is one cycle, a 5% discharge 20 times is one cycle.\nWhether that cycle takes a half day, a full day or a week all depends on how you use it; sleeping will put a very, small draw on your battery versus being off but the difference is almost negligible - I am assuming that you are not sleeping your MacBook for weeks at a time.\nEven when you keep your MBP plugged in, you are reducing the per day cycle count; however you are not eliminating it.\nWhy does cycle count matter?  From the article again...\n\nAs the battery is continually used, however, small-scale side\nreactions build up at the SEI layer, which decreases battery\ncapacity—how much of a charge the battery can hold.\n\nBottom line\nIt's doesn't matter.  You can expect to replace your battery somewhere between year 3 and 4.  Can you get longer?  Yes.  Can it be shorter?  Yes.  It's tough to know exactly when, but choosing \"sleep\" over \"power off\" isn't going to make a big difference.\n\nA: There are many factors/measures when it comes to batteries, and often people get confused by the various terms and what they mean. For example, Battery life is the amount of time it will last before it needs recharging, while Battery lifespan refers to the overall life of your battery before it needs replacing. \nThere are many other terms/factors and this type of confusion leads to debate/argument about what is best practice.\nHowever, in the event this question isn't closed because it's primarily opinion-based, the best advice I can offer you and other readers is to familiarise yourself with what Apple says about their batteries - this removes the 'opinion' out of it!\nTo do this go to: http://www.apple.com/batteries/\n\nA: *\n\n*When the Li-battery is in a lower battery, the loss must be larger than now, so if you charge it until your battery runs out, it will speed up the losses.\n\n*By the way, If there has some problem your on the battery percentage, so you can try to let the battery run out and charge\nit.\n\n*In fact, the phone also need sleep or have a rest, the same as the human. So we suggest that the phone need to shutdown and restart once, it can extend the battery life.\n\n", "Q: Use USB microphone (like a Snowball by Blue) to iPhone with Lightning cable How to use a USB microphone like the Snowball Ice by Blue with an iPhone with Lightning port (such as iPhone SE)?\n\nA: You'll need the Lightning to USB Camera adapter from Apple and then connect your microphone there.\nDepending on the microphone, you could require an external USB power source. This is normally done by adding in a powered USB hub.\nNote that this might not work with your specific microphone. It works with some USB microphones, but it is not really supported hardware by Apple.\n\nA: Digital Inspiration has an article on how to hook up a USB microphone to your iPhone:\n\nTo get started, you would need a powered USB hub (look for the power adapter symbol in the description, also go for USB 3.0) and the lightning to USB adapter (remember, it’s the adapter and not the cable). Now connect the iPhone /iPad to the USB microphone through the USB hub as shown in the illustration above.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Plug one end of the Apple Lightning to USB adapter into the Lightning port of your iPhone or iPad and connect the other end to the powered USB hub through the supplied USB Type B cable.\n  \n*Use the power adapter cord to connect the hub to the electrical outlet.\n  \n*Connect the external USB microphone to one of the available ports on the hub using the same USB cable that you were previously using to connect the mic to the desktop computer.\n  \n\n\nA: The solution from digital inspiration worked perfectly with my blue snowball mic, all I did was connect one end of the supplied charging cable to my iPad & the other end to one of the rear USB ports of a cheapo USB 2.0 USB hub. Then I connected the blue snowball mic to another rear USB port on the hub. Finally I used an AC/DC adapter to connect the USB hub to the main power supply. Switched it on and voila! Red led turns on the snowball indicating there is power running to the device. Note that I first tried to connect the snowball to a front port on the USB hub but it didn't power on, I needed to use the rear ports to get it to work. I did not however need to buy any special adapters. One ordinary charger cable supplied with iPad/iPhone, 1 powered USB hub connected to 220v/110v main power supply. Too easy.\n", "Q: Strange messages? Im hoping some friendly soul would have the time to review these system messages im getting.

However, I considered that it might be a good idea to keep the old Mac in case something happens to the new Mac, but for that to be useful I would need to be able to restore the new Mac's Time Machine backup to the old Mac temporarily. \nIs it possible to restore a newer model Mac's Time Machine backup to an older model Mac with the same OS version? What about different Mac OS versions?\n\nA: Yes, depending on the options you select when doing the migration.\nIn terms of documents and other data this will usually be fine. I'll provide an example below of when documents/data may be a problem.\nIn terms of software, this will depend on its compatibility with the version of MacOS you're running. For example, if you're running XYZ software that is only compatible with macOS Sierra and then restore that to a Mac running El Capitan, it will be copied across but won't run. Another potential issue is that you may need to re-register some 3rd party software (but if so, this is a minor inconvenience and does not result in any increased expense).\nNow for my example of when data may be an issue. Your data will be copied across fine, but if the data is from a newer version of software that has actually changed the format of its data, then accessing that data from an older version of the software may be a problem. In any case, the data will still be there and is backed up.\nOn a final note, you would normally ensure the other Mac has an OS already installed when you restore your applications, documents etc.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra: Configuring Subversion/SVN on Apache Every Mac OSX/macOS update brings further challenges to get svn working after the update.  Sierra's the latest.\nI have a subversion repo in ~/svnRepo\nI run some windows development stuff in a VM running on 172.16.99.4 which can connect to the Mac host using http://172.16.99.1.

Clients contact an svnserve server by using URLs that begin with the svn:// or svn+ssh:// scheme. This section will explain the different ways of running svnserve, how clients authenticate themselves to the server, and how to configure appropriate access control to your repositories.\n\nA copy of svnserve is included with Xcode:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svnserve\n\nsvnserve does not require an Apache httpd instance or any other server to work. The svnserve process listens and handles connections from svn clients.\nSecurity Considerations\nYou can add tunnelling over ssh and other approaches to add security. Without additional configuration, a plain svnserve instance is not recommended for exposure to the Internet; it is not secure by default.\nHowever, for your local-only situation svnserve is likely enough.\n", "Q: Is there a manual for Finder?

While watching videos, the screen just cut to black.  Now it won't do anything on boot - the MacBook screen just comes up black.  I've tried zapping the PRAM, (ahem, NVRAM), an SMC reset, nada.  It seems that the backlight is working - it's \"LCD black\" black, meaning it's not truly dark it looks like the backlight is working.\nSafe boot, boot to recovery, verbose safe boot, nothing happens.\nI have an external monitor.  On the external, it shows the apple boot screen, the progress bar gets to about 40% across, then even the external monitor goes black.\nMy guess is, hardware issue, Genius Bar time?  I hope not... don't feel like buying a new board.\nEDIT: it needed an SMC reset. I didn't do it properly, and it did work, eventually. \nEDIT2: 1) you don't want a full battery for an SMC reset. I always had it charging. I unplugged from power and plugged in some spinning-rust hard drives to sap power. This helped. 2) I found mirror mode. Command F1 mirrors the main login screen to the external monitor. I can then login do a backup and wipe the drives \n\nA: It honestly seems like you have already tried everything a genius bar would try themselves. However I think I might have some attempts here to help you out.\nAll boot-up key combinations can be seen from here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all connected USB, HDMI, or other plugged in devices including power cable. Try booting again with holding option to select a disk. I recommend doing this after steps 2 + 3, but remove cables first.\n\n*Lets ensure you are indeed resetting the SMC. This works best without 100% battery, because the light will be orange when charging and the computer is off. While off and the light is orange, hold down shift+control+alt/option and then after holding those three keys hold the power button a moment and release and watch the light change from orange to green to orange again. Volume should also get reset from this. (This can be done without any issues involving firmware password)\n\n*Clearing NVRAM by holding Command-Option-P-R. NOTE: This will require your firmware password to clear it, but I don't think it will clear with one as I've noticed it doesn't for my MBPr mid 2012. So if you can, remove the firmware password and then try this. But from a command-line terminal the following command will also clear your NVRAM.\nRequires Administrator privileges! This is also funky with MacOS Sierra due to new restrictions with their attempts for a new secure system meaning it'll require you to be in safe mode to run it. \nsudo nvram boot-args -c\n\nI have more info on boot-arguments if necessary. Just ask.\n\n\n*Boot into Internet recovery by holding Command+option+R (Differs from normal recovery because this downloads your original factory release OS recovery rather than using the partition of your current OS on disk.)\n\n*If it is hardware, lets try Apple's Intel CPU check by holding down 'D' while booting up. This is a hardware test and takes a while.\nLet me know how you make out.\n\nA: I recently had the problem of the black screen with cursor. There are many possible reasons for that and most of them of them are alarming and hint at hardware failures. Following this post, I found out that this is simply due to a corrupted configuration file that messes with the login window. So, instead of reinstalling the whole system, boot in single-user mode (hitting command-S at the chime) and then mount the filesystem (using the instructions at the boot) and then type\nrm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist\n\nand then\nexit\n\nto reboot.\nThis solved it for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem my 2013 MacBook booted but the screen stayed black. The diagnostics reported VFD002. I tried a lot of things and all the different key combinations to reset NVRAM etc.\nIn the end I could fix the problem by pushing on the cable that connect the mother board to the display. For this you have to open the MacBook (checkout the videos on YouTube) and find the connector for the cable. I pressed slightly on the connector and that solved the problem.\nSee also here for a similar solution to this problem.\n", "Q: How do I kill Siri In other words, which file causes Siri to stop changing PID?\nEven though I force process to quit, it will spawn again.\n\nA: Mac Preferences -> Siri -> uncheck Enable Siri checkbox. -> Reboot.\nThis will stop Siri from running.\nTo answer your question about changing PIDs, PID is a Process ID.

I am working in a small web dev' office currently providing the creative to a team of 6. Good hardware, server and LAN infrastructure internally which, although Win based, talks to the Mac's OK. Presentation is mostly digital although there is a requirement (at times) to paper visualise at A3, for example, to maintain a printed folio, provide client support and internal marketing. The creative output will driven from either of two i7 Quadcore Macs running OS 10.8, Adobe suite. The quality needs to be good to high although I am NOT expecting production print proofing - if I want that I will get it from my external contractors and generally on final stock.\nRequirement details as follows:\nGeneral\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac and Windows drivers \n\n*Network compatible via ethernet (WiFi fine as an extra although must be wired LAN primarily) \n\n*Postscript on board (still a feature? - please see below *) \n\n*Print server (?) included in software / drivers. We don't need to admin / manage usage, more for handling the queue if 2/3 people try to print at once - we are all in different rooms. \n\n*Ideally with reasonable processor / RAM to cope with small queues (generally not more than two of us printing at once)\n\n\nUsage / Speed\n\n\n*\n\n*Web and creative team. Relatively small outputs, we mostly use electronic delivery and are a 'green' office so paper use will be 'light'\n\n*Colour and Black / White\n\n*Inkjet is OK as long as reasonable robust (we are tired of Canon error b200 print head faults which turn out to be dried ink and cost £80 to replace!)\n\n*Speed isn't an issue for us and at the PC / Mac end, we are all high powered hardware for initial file processing.\n\n\nQuality\n\n\n*\n\n*Draft = for text documents reasonably quickly (light use again, no manuals or heavy print required) \n\n*High Quality = we need a quality output\nat A3 for creative visuals - good enough to show a client / takeaway\n/ produce minor marketing in the office (posters, info graphics).\n\n\n(*) Note: the creative work will be coming directly from Acrobat or Indesign CS6 / Cloud on a Macintosh over ethernet. In the past I installed network printers with built in postscript like the Oki B4350n which helped with text rendering.

Epson Workforce WF 7610 (Europe) A3+ colour inkjet. You can Google the specs and processor\nHighlights\n - Workgroup inkjet so decent processing power / ram to queue jobs for multiple PCs at once\n - Works excellently with Mac OS 10.8 with provided support utilities\n - Ditto Windows 10 boxes and runs over a Win wired network\n - Integrates with Mac Image Capture function for scanning direct to desktop\n - Scanner / Copier bed is full A3 and 10 seconds (fast) on standard resolution\n - A3+ colour print - high quality option with Epson papers and inks (good enough for client first visuals, office print)\n - Draft (standard) A4 B/W print is fast 2 seconds to spool, 3 seconds a page\n - Fax function to print / desktop included (phone line input)\n - Easy, logical set-up with touch screen colour panel\n - Fast start from cold and relatively quite running\n - Connectivity solid with on-board net card / ethernet, direct USB to PC, WiFi including 'air print' mobile phone bridge function, USB Flash, SD card, MS Duo\n\nCaveats?\n - inks expensive but that goes also for HP, Canon, etc (offset by relatively cheap initial purchase - sub £200 Amazon)\n - requires Epson papers / inks for best results (but will take standard copier paper and 3rd party ink)\n - trays a little flimsy (unit itself is solid, will take some knocks)\n - footprint = 55cm x 55cm with front and rear paper feeds (for A3 nothing more than expected)\n\nWould I recommend it?\nYes. Early days for reliability / cost of running although for functions, connectivity (ethernet, USB and WiFi print), ease of set up, Mac support, A3 scanning and workgroup capability I am smiling. Scanning and print quality are subjective to some degree and you can get better / faster obviously for more bucks - both good enough for my needs and if I go beyond this I go external and charge it on to the client (e.g. bound presentation visuals for a corporate).\nEND\n", "Q: Application not in the App Store Search When I search for my app by it's name 'Go Arc 2' I cannot find it in the App Store Search on iPad/iPhone.\nI can find other apps that I've uploaded (we sell the app as a white label to different organization - we upload the same code but change the icon/splash and a short CFG file)\nI clicked on any other app that I've uploaded (e.g. nilit)\nThan I clicked `Developer Apps', \nfound the app that is missing in the search \nsent my self a link\nopen the link in iPad/iPhone \nAnd was able to install the app.\nWe recently had our apps removed because the APPLE DEVELOPER PROGRAM add expired, we paid and renew it yesterday.\nThis probably related to the app missing from search, but if so than how come the other apps appear in the search?\nPlease help.\n\nA: The App Store does perform a lot of caching, so you will probably have to wait up to 24 hours to see your apps back on the store and appearing in search results.

Why? For the simple reason that upgrading the MBP SSD is expensive! It's not your standard SATA drive. A new 1TB SSD for that computer will run you ~$650 (based on OWC prices).\n2)Your SSD Read/Write speed should already be around 400-500MBps. A new SSD's performance would probably not be noticeable. It is almost certainly not worth paying the $650 for just the speed boost.\n3) I would suggest at least one (possibly two) backups. Note that if you buy your new SSD from OWC or if you get the OWC Envoy, you can plug your old SSD into your computer via USB, so having an extra (second) backup is less important if you take this route.\n4) I'm not sure exactly what you mean here. You can use an external SSD as either a storage drive or a boot drive or both, but boot times from an external drive might be slower than from an internal drive.\nPlease comment with any questions or if you see any mistakes in my answer.\n", "Q: iPhone 6S will not charge to 100% My iPhone 6S will not charge to 100%.

Apple's controversial decision to convert all the ports on their 2016 MacBook Pro lineup to USB-C ports contributes to blur the difference between ports that supply power (such as a power adapters) and ports that can power external devices (such as USB keys, mice or other gadgets).\n\nThis made me think about the following scenario: you sit at a table where your laptop is plugged in on the right, and don't notice that it is plugged in, so you decide to charge it with a second nearby charger that is laying around (i.e. belonging to someone who lives with you and who recently sat at the same spot).\nWhat would happen then? \nWould the computer charge twice as fast, would one of the chargers be dismissed by the system (which one?), or would it generate a surcharge that would destroy the computer?\nI couldn't find anything about this online, but since I am always trying to force a USB in the MagSafe charger of my MacBook Air, I think that I could easily end up making this kind of mistake.\nNote: My question asks what happens when two chargers are inserted into a MacBook Pro, but I am also wondering what would happend if 3, or 4 chargers were inserted. Although this scenario is unlikely to happen by mistake, it would constitute an obvious vulnerability to an exposed device, i.e. in a public space.\n\nA: They don't push power (watts) but they do push VOLTAGE.\nAnd if a charger pushes the wrong voltage, bad things can happen to your device.\nThe voltage is negotiated between devices (e.g. charger/mac), but if the charger is non-compliant, bad things can happen.\n\nA: This person tried it and it lost its ability to charge. Given this Apple support page that Alan Shutko linked in his answer, however, my guess is that this damage would be covered by the warranty.\n\nA: The system will choose the power source that provides the most power, and it will not draw power from the others.\nApple has released a support article (and another one) describing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your MacBook Pro draws power from only one power supply, even if more\nthan one is attached—so using multiple power supplies will not speed\nup charging.\n\n\n*If you connect multiple power supplies to your MacBook\nPro, the one that provides the most power will be used, regardless of\nthe order in which you connected them.\n\n\n*You should not connect any\npower supply that exceeds 100W, as it might damage your Mac.\n\n", "Q: Applescript-how can I expand a list view window's contents so everything shows hierarchically and expanded Given a root directory upon selection, I need to traverse the directory and all other subdirectories, expanding all subfolders, so that everything shows hierarchically in the finder's list view.\nThis answer select-all-non-folders-in-an-expanded-list-view-window acts to select all items in an expanded view. \nI need to expand all subfolders, until all subfolders from the root directory have been expanded, showing the contents of the root folder and all subfolders hierarchically.\n\nA: You can expand all sub-directories with an alt-click on the arrow left of your directory. \n", "Q: What is \"Television\" in System Information report for an external monitor (that is not actually a TV)?

Why? my strategy is that I resubmit it. But it is often that resending does not help. Do you know the reason why Apple does not let it appear?\n\nA: The binary will appear, but it just takes time. Sometimes it'll be visible within minutes, sometimes a few hours, depending on a range of factors (network bandwidth, server congestion, processing times, etc).\nAlso, some people don't realise that they need to click on the '+' sign under the Build section. That is, when it's ready, it'll appear and clicking on this reveals the binary.\nMy personal experience has been that it usually takes about a half hour to appear, but once it did take almost 18hrs. I suspect at present there will be larger than usual demand on Apple's servers, reviewers, etc because many developers are updating apps, not just because of iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, but especially because of Xcode 8.1 and Swift 3.\nAlso useful is this site for checking average App Store Review times (I know it's not what you're actually asking about, but it's a useful resource nonetheless).\n", "Q: How to get total amount for each client in a list automatically? Let's say I have a long list of clients in one column of a Numbers table, most of them occurring multiple times, and in the adjacent column are amounts due for services received, as depicted below. What is the easiest way to automatically add up all the amounts for each client and have them appear either in a third column or in a new table next to his or her name? That is, for Ava I would like the total of 300 + 800 + 1200 + 1600 = 3900 to appear somewhere next to her name, for Chloe it should be 450 + 950 = 1400, and so on.\n\nIdeally, it should require as little maintenance as possible. For instance, if a new client is added to the list, a new entry/row should automatically appear in the third column/new table with that person's name and the sum of all their amounts.\n\nA: This works with the formula sumif(). In your example the formula would be something like this: SUMIF($A$2:$A$22,A2,$B$2:B22). \n\n\nA: A few days after posting this question, I stumbled upon a post in the Apple support communities which describes exactly my problem. Two solutions are offered there. For the sake of completeness, I'll reproduce here the one I deem superior.\nThe solution requires adding an extra column to the table to hold the 'client number' which can be calculated via\nIF(COUNTIF(B$1:B2,B2)=1,MAX(A$1:A1)+1,\"\")\n\nInsert this formula into the first cell in the new column and simply drag down to get something like this.\n\nNext, create a second table with two columns and at least as many rows as there are unique entries in the first table. To copy all unique client names from the first table to the left column of table, add this formula to its first cell and drag down.\nIFERROR(INDEX(Bookkeeping::$Name,MATCH(ROW(cell)−1,$Client,0),column-index,area-index),\"\")\n\nFinally, add this formula to the first cell of the second column and drag down to get the total amount for each client.\nSUMIF(Bookkeeping::Name,A2,Amount)\n\nThe resulting second table should look something like this.\n\nThe nice thing about this solution is that adding a new name to the first table will automatically result in a new entry to the second table with that same name and the sum of all associated amounts.\nThe numbers file from which these screenshots were taken can be obtained here.\n", "Q: Disable DNS assignment with Airport Extreme IPv6 tunnel I've got an IPv6 tunnel from Hurricane Electric, configured into one of my Apple Airport Extremes (which is otherwise setup in bridge mode).\nThat's all fine, except that in the IPv6 Route Advertisement messages the Airport Extreme then insists on advertising itself as a DNS server for the local LAN.\nI don't want this, as I've got perfectly good BIND instances on my network performing DNSSEC validation and the Airport's DNS server doesn't do this.\nIs there any way to disable that functionality?\n\nA: That's a sneaky one - I'm sure you looked into the Airport Utility configuration.\nTried to assign a static IPv6 to it? Fiddle with IPv6 DNS& share setting. \nI don't know if there is a way to turn off the RA - since they are supposed to \"maintain\" network quality, and this is a connect&forget device so maybe that's a default and it's fixed. I dont know a way to send ipv6 nd ra suppress all to it :-)\nIf you assign a static IPv6 to a rr, it still uses the info from the RA's in the ICMPv6 (type 134) that comes along to get the default gateway and/or the mac+link local from the first hop. See what happens when you fill static IPv6 where possible. \n", "Q: Apple Music: Are recommendations based on local play counts? It seems that play counts are totally disfunctional in the latest versions of iTunes (versions 12.5.3 currently).  I know that there have been sync problems all the time, but since I joined Apple Music it won't even increase the count for songs played from the local library in the local iTunes.  Most of the songs in my library are stuck at zero plays although I listen to them often.\nEverything else in Apple Music seems to be working all right.  In particular, the \"For You\" Section does show my latest plays under \"Recent plays\", just the numbers in the library remain zero forever.  I wonder if it is relevant, or if maybe Apple Music keeps playcounts separate from the local ones.\n\nA: Unfortunately the solution provided does not work for all of us. Every day I play music from iCloud Music Library on my iPhone, and every day only the first track I listen to has the play count increased by 1.\n\nA: This is a bug.  I solved it by logging out of iCloud on my iOS devices and back in.  It then synced a whole week full of playcounts that it had seemingly cached locally on the iPhone.  Now playcounts also update in iTunes again.\nGiven the (scarce) documentation of Apple Music, it seems that recommendations are indeed based on play counts to.  For example sometimes it explains \"Since you are listening to ...\" above some recommendations.  (Admittedly these could also be based on existence in the library).\nThere is a \"Heavy rotation\" section in \"For you\" and this is definitely based on recent plays, as it was not updating for me, and it is updating now.\n", "Q: How to stop Apple Watch from unlocking a Mac with lid closed I am using the Apple Watch to unlock my Macbook Pro Retina (Late 2013) and it works reasonably well, almost too well:  When I stop working with the Macbook and close the lid, but stay in proximity, I will very soon get a notification that the Mac was unlocked using the Apple Watch. Then a minute later I will get another one, and another one.  I have gotten up to 7, but most of the time it stops after two or three.  Opening the lid right after one of these notifications confirms that the computer is unlocked.  I suspect that this has something to do with Powernap.\nI do not want to disable either Powernap or Unlock with Apple Watch.  Is this a bug I just have to live with?\nHow could I debug the issue?\n\nA: This seems to be fixed in the current versions of MacOS and WatchOS.\n", "Q: How are these Chinese spam iCloud Calendar/Reminders invitations sent to me? Recently, I’ve received a couple of spam event invitations in Calendar on my Mac. The most recent had only Chinese text, and recurred at 5:46am every day.\nI am able to decline these by clicking on the invitations button in the toolbar (that only appears when an invitation comes in). However, ideally I’d like to not receive these spam invitations at all.\nAs I’ve never received a genuine invitation through Calendar, I thought I might be able to turn off the invitation feature. However, I can’t see any controls for this in Calendar preferences or the Internet Account system preferences.\nThrough what mechanism do these invitation arrive? If I understood what mechanism it was, I might be able to turn it off. I have two Calendar accounts enabled: iCloud, and Facebook. I can’t see anything in my e-mail, so I presume they’re not regular e-mail spam.\nSince first writing this question, I’ve had a similar invitation come through in Reminders:\n\n\nA: It's simply that anyone can send an email to you. If spam rules don't block it, Apple software (with default settings) processes the invitation before you can take any action.\nTo prevent this automatic processing, try this. \nLog in to iCloud on the web, open your calendar and go to ⚙ > Preferences (in the lower left corner). Under Advanced tab you’ll find an option to receive calendar invitations by e-mail instead of directly to your calendar.\n\n\nA: Invitations can only come through direct email input, meaning that the inviter has your email address. How did the inviter get hold of your email? that's another issue. \n", "Q: macOS Sierra 10.12: Configure firewall for a single port (3690) How can one configure the Firewall on macOS Sierra 10.12 to open up a single port (in this case port 3690)?\nThere's no obvious UI to do this.\n\nA: If you are using Sierra's Application Firewall you can't restrict it to a single port.\nTo allow incoming traffic for a specific binary, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Firewall Options and either hit the plus button and choose the binary or drop the binary from a Finder window.\nIn my example below I have chosen the X11 binary in /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/\nYou can the check additional apps added by executing:\nsudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --listapps\n\n\nAfter adding Xcode, anything starting with svn in /usr/bin/ and /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/ and starting /usr/bin/svnserve I was asked once to allow incoming traffic for svnserve (I don't know which of both svnserve executables) and it worked from remote. After removing everything and repeating the same steps it failed again.\nThe log file at /var/log stays empty and the other logs don't reveal anything related to blocked incoming connections.\nI recommend to enable ssh and create a ssh:svn-tunnel. Link: Subversion through a tunnel\n\nAs an alternative install Murus - a GUI for pf. If you don't activate it with an email and a serial number it will run as the free Murus Lite.\nOpen the app and choose a strategy. E.g. Novice > Predefined Firewall Configuration Presets > Almost all services blocked. Then activate the selected Murus preset and start pf.\nHit the library button. In the services library panel hit the gear \n\nand add a new custom service SVN:\n\nIn the groups library hit the gear and add new custom group\n\nHit the loupe, enter a group name, add an appropriate interface, hit the plus button and add an IP or network.\n\nDrag the SVN service to the main windows (Managed inbound services) and configure it:\n\nIf you have additional services like SSH running, add them also. Start or restart pf if necessary. Now - protected by pf - you may dissable the application firewall.\n", "Q: Symlink for OneDrive I did research beforehand on google How to Sync Any Folder to the Cloud With Symbolic Links and on Ask Different, but I still cannot find an answer to this specific question.\n\nThe file I want to symlink to is in the following format:\n/Users/Name/OneDrive\\ -\\ X\\ Y\\ Education/Documents/Z\\ Documents\nZ\\ Documents is the name of a subfolder of (~/Documents)\n\nI tried rewriting it in different ways for it to be without any spaces as symlink requires there to be like that, but had no luck. I am quite inexperienced in this, but I was thinking maybe you can do something like quotation marks for Terminal to consider it one 'term'?\nIf something in this question is unclear, please leave a comment and I will do my best to clarify. Any possible answers are appreciated. Thank you.\nIMPORTANT EDIT\nThank you for your help and effort. I made a mistake in my question with the directories, but I think it is a bit too big to correct, so I am going to rewrite it here if it's alright.\nHere the directory that I want to link to:\n/Users/NAME/OneDrive\\ -\\ PATH\\ TO\\ TARGET/Documents/X\\ Documents\n\nThe first part is the location of the folder on my drive. The second part (after the first space) where is states 'PATH TO TARGET\" is some part of the directory which is required to connect to the server or something like that. 'Documents' is a subfolder of OneDrive and 'X\\ Documents' is a subfolder of 'Documents'.\nI have listed the 'source' ONLY above. The target I would like to be found in folder in my defaults downloads location:\n~/Downloads/X Documents\n\nWhat I would like to happen, is when I open the folder X Documents, I am redirected to the source directory I described earlier (X Documents within Documents within OneDrive)\nThank you again for your time helping me out with this.\n\nA: To get a file symlinked from your Documents folder to your OneDrive folder (or any folder for that matter) you need to format the command completely and properly\nCreating a symlink:\nln -s SOURCE TARGET\n\nMore specifically, it must take on the form\nln -s /path/to/source /path/to/target\n\nLet's say we are trying to create a link from a folder called \"Personal\" that's located on OneDrive and you want it to show up under Documents.\nln -s /Users/USERNAME/OneDrive/Personal /Users/USERNAME/Documents/Personal\n\nNow, in your \"Documents\" folder, you will see a folder called \"Personal.\"\nSpaces in the path and/or filename\nThere are two ways to address spaces within the path or filename.  Using the example from above, if the folder was called Personal Stuff we could handle it one of two ways:\n\n*\n\n*Use backslashes () to escape the space:\nln -s /Users/USERNAME/OneDrive/Personal\\ Stuff /Users/USERNAME/Documents/Personal\\ Stuff\n\n\n*Use quotes (\") to encapsulate the whole string:\nln -s \"/Users/USERNAME/OneDrive/Personal Stuff\" \"Users/USERNAME/OneDrive/Personal Stuff\"\nUsing the tilde (~) for your home directory\nThe tilde (~) is just a shortcut to your home directory.  So, instead of typing out /Users/USERNAME/foo/bar/filename.ext you can simply shorten it to ~/foo/bar/filename.ext\nYou can use it when creating your symlinks with no problem:\nln -s \"/Users/USERNAME/OneDrive/Personal Stuff\" \"~/OneDrive/Personal Stuff\"\nKeep in mind that the tilde (~) changes for each user.  This is why I have gotten in the habbit of just typing out the whole path; just to be sure I'm putting the link exactly where I want it.\nSymlinking per your example\nln -s ~/OneDrive\\ -\\ Documents/X\\ Documents ~/Downlaods/X\\ Documents\n\nThis will create a link called  \"X Documents\" in the Downloads Folder of the  \"X Documents\" folder found on OneDrive.\nYou can find further details about the the ln command by typing man ln.\n", "Q: Mac OS Sierra 10.12.1 Dock behaviour and command tab issue I've got a brand new computer which I bought last week. I've noticed that sometimes when I cycle programmes using command and tab, some of the icons don't appear, even though the programme is open. The only way I can get to them is to click the icon on the dock or find the window manually.\nI've also noticed that quite often when I quit a programme it remains as if it were open in the dock, even though it has been quit.\nTo fix it I can run killall Dock in terminal, but it then later happens again. Not ideal.\nCan anyone else report something similar? I'm trying to diagnose if its an issue with the computer or Sierra; I don't want to have to send it back but shouldn't be having problems this early on. I even did a clean reinstall this morning and the problem still persists.\n\nA: Yes. I have a mid 2015 MBP which I have upgraded to Sierra from Mavericks and before that all the way back to Lion.\nI find that Cmd-Tab frequently (more often than not) fails to tab to the correct window, stopping 'one short' which suggests that the list of icons displayed when Cmd Tabbing is different from the internal list of programs that it cycles through for some reason.\nI also recently had a problem (for the first time) where Terminal windows failed to show in the task switcher at all until I restarted the OS.\n", "Q: Change Whatsapp-for-Mac notification sound I'm here to ask you if is possible to change Whatsapp for Mac Notification sound. I tried to find any not-sound in library folder and into Whatsapp's Package contents without no result. Could you help me solving this trouble? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge this is not possible with the current desktop version of WhatsApp.\nSome users have tried changing the notification sound on their iPhones in the hope it would also change it on their 'synced' desktop version, but this doesn't work either. \nAnd, as you've stated, showing package contents doesn't seem to reveal any audio files.\nHowever, the desktop version has only been around for about six months, so it's ripe for user feedback. I'd send an email to support@whatsapp.com.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Actually, after passing more than 4 years, still WhatsApp desktop macOS version doesn't have setting for changing notification sound.\n", "Q: Looking for an app to name colors on Mac (colorblind)? I am colorblind. I am looking for an app to help me identify colors by their basic names (blue, green, ...) when I am working on powerpoint or excel on mac (OSX 10.12).\nOn windows, I was using whatcolor quite successfully. This app translates the RGB code of the pixel under your mouse into intelligible color names such as blue, green, ... it's a real time-saver when you have to create powerpoints or excel.\nI could not find anything similar so far on mac. I tried apps such as Visolve or Sim Daltonism but they did not have this simple functionality.\nPlease note I am not looking for a color picker such as DigitalColor Meter, that would just read out color RGB codes from pixels. I need a tool that \"names\" colors, stay on top of screen, with a compact window, just like whatcolor. \n\nA: There are 2 apps on mac that name colors to help people with color blindness: \n\n\n*\n\n*A free app called ColorCompass. It basically does the same job as WhatColor, although with a more simple color naming system. It's small, has instant color naming and stay on top of other windows. \n\n*Also a free app called ColorQuest. But this app takes more screen space and is quite slow. I did not find a way to make it stay on top, a deal breaker for me.\n\n\nAs a background, I am colorblind too and I personally use ColorCompass on my Mac to work with Mac Office all day long on a daily basis. \n", "Q: Mac monitor is displaying screen but I cannot navigate my cursor to it I'm using a VGA adapter to connect my Macbook Pro to an external monitor and I see the Macbook screen on my external display but I'm not able to move my cursor to it. It was working just fine a day ago, all of a sudden my cursor is not able to navigate there and I'm not able to drag any open windows to the screen either.\n\nA: Check that the virtual display arrangement in System Prefs > Display > Arrangement is the same as their physical placement.\nYou can only move your mouse across between the two at the side where they join.\n\nYou can drag & drop either of the virtual screens until they match your physical layout. When dragging, both the virtual & real screen will display a bright red border, so you know which you are working with.\nThe white menu bar can be dragged separately & should be placed [if it isn't already] on your main monitor.\nAlso note that if the screens are not the same resolution [size actually doesn't matter, only resolution, as displayed in that control panel] then you may have a smaller 'gap' where you can pass from one to the other, as in this picture...\n\n\nA: It turns out that it was inverted. Instead of navigating to the monitor from the left side of the screen, I should have been going through the right side. My monitor was set up to the left of my computer so it was a bit disorienting so I changed it.\n", "Q: Keynote - gray out previous bullets In Keynote 6.6.1, how do I make the \"previous\" bullets become grayed-out when advancing bullets?\nI know it has something to do with \"Build Order\" and \"build out\", but I don't want the bullets to completely disappear (with splashy animations) after they are no longer \"current\". Rather I want them to remain visible, but in a slightly diminished form.\nHow to achieve that?\nI used to have this nailed down, but I think the UI has changed and/or I forgot how to do this.\nKinda inverse of the animated gif found in the question here: Reveal each bullet by opacity in Keynote 6.6?\n\nA: Ok. Found it. You just have to select \"By highlighted bullet\" instead of \"By bullet\" for build order.\nHas nothing to do with build-out!\n", "Q: How do I add cover art to an .aiff on OSX from the commandline How do I add cover art to an .aif file on OSX from the commandline.\nWith ffmpeg this seems fairly easy for mp3 and other formats but i need aiff's with cover art.  \n\nA: Under OS X, I've used Kid3 to add cover art to AIFF files, from both the GUI and CLI with the latter in both direct and interactive modes. The CLI version is not for the faint of heart and you must read the documentation  The Kid3 Handbook (English version) to use the CLI, especially the CLI examples section as it shows something that's not shown elsewhere in the documentation or output of the internal help file of kid3-cli.\nWhich is the use of single quotes around the commands being used, e.g.:\nkid3-cli -c 'select \"/path/to/filename.aiff\"' -c 'set picture:\"/path/to/coverart.jpg\" \"Picture Description\"' -c 'save'\n\nNote that the example above is basic syntax for just setting cover art and /path/to/ can be omitted if everything is in the working directory and \"Picture Description\" can be \"\" if no description is wanted, but it has to be supplied one way or the other in this use case.\nThe kid3-cli executable is within the kid3.app application bundle, e.g. /Applications/kid3.app/Contents/MacOS/kid3-cli and to make it easier to use, you might want to set an alias for it in your bash profile file or set a symlink for it to a location that is within the PATH variable.\nExample for your bash profile file:\nalias kid3-cli='/Applications/kid3.app/Contents/MacOS/kid3-cli'\n\nExample to create a symlink from Terminal:\nsudo ln -s /Applications/kid3.app/Contents/MacOS/kid3-cli /usr/local/bin/kid3-cli\n\nThen from the command line you could use: kid3-cli ...\n", "Q: How to get Apples Human Interface Guidelines 2016 as epub or pdf file?

I searched \"All My Files\" for ePub files, then choose all of them (+500) and opened them all at once with iBooks and they all reloaded to iBooks.... and, importantly, before I did that, I turned off iCloud storage for iBooks. I resist using Terminal because I am a novice (at best) but this situation follows typical Apple nonsense: what seems like a good idea (storing all your books on iCloud) turns into a general threat to something pretty important. I choose rather a personal \"cloud\" via a 3TB hard drive (LaCie) with wi-fi. \n", "Q: Is there a way to disable a disk or disk controller before OSX boots? Context:\nI use a mac for data recovery forensic operations, and for compliance with my users' requirements, I need to guarantee that no disk writes will be performed on a physical hard disk attached to a mac until a user enables the disk.\nQuestion:\nIs it possible to disable all access to a disk, SATA port, or disk controller entirely outside of the OS, before the system boots?\nDisabling only read access is acceptable, but tends to be harder to verify compared to \"make the computer act like the disk itself isn't plugged in\".\nWhen we were doing data recovery with a Linux homemade tower, we would go into the BIOS and disable the SATA port with the sensitive disks on it.\nIt's OK to disable the entire disk controller as part of a solution; these systems are externally booted from USB devices, and internal hard disks will not be used until they are re-enabled.\nThe physical port to which the disks in question are connected will not change.\nWhat I've Tried:\nI've seen the solutions to this question. Those solutions all disable disks right after boot, which is not sufficient: disabling automount of the disk or hiding it from OSX's disk management does not satisfy the users' (admittedly silly) audit requirements.\nOther Ideas:\nIs it possible to do this from an EFI shell? I'm happy to install rEFInd or similar on the bootable USBs.\nAre there nvram settings that can be changed to achieve this?\nAre there kernel boot parameters that instruct OSX not to initialize or use a PCI device, tree, or disk?\nAre there kernel modules that I could install that would achieve this? If so, they'd probably need to be open source so the users could audit them and make sure they're loaded early enough to not let any writes through.\nSince the recovery OS is USB, are there kexts that I could uninstall in order to disable access to all disks/SATA devices?\n\nA: A simple solution since you are booting off a USB/Recovery disk, you could mount the drive in \"read only\" via diskutil:\ndiskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/diskX\n\nNow, if your USB/Recovery disk has already mounted it when it loads, you will have to unmount it first:\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX\n\ndiskX is the drive identifier of the disk you are attempting to (un)mount.  You can find it by issuing the command diskutil list and finding the drive you are interested in.\nFrom the manpage:\n\nMount a single volume.  If readOnly is specified, then the file system\n  is mounted read-only, even if the volume's underlying file system\n  and/or device and/or media supports writing; even the super-user may\n  not write to it; this is the same as the rdonly option to mount (8). \n  If a -mountPoint is specified, then that path, rather than the\n  standard path of /Volumes/VolumeName, will be used as the view into\n  the volume file content; a directory at that path must already exist.\n\n", "Q: How do I increase the font size in Activity Monitor?

I'm looking for an app or some software to install on my Macbook which would let me test things locally.\nIs it possible with xcode?\n\nA: The only way to test on a previous version of iOS on an iPad/iPhone/iPod is to actually restore a backup to the version or wipe out the existing version and install a previous version over it.\nThere's no app that will allow you to do what you're looking for because the devices just won't allow it.\nIt's rare that an iOS update itself will cause the stock mail app to stop working.

I notice that from my iPad, it uses my Apple ID, and I do not want that. I went to settings and clicked on send and receive but it only shows 3 different email addresses no phone number. If I sign out, I am inable to send messages without signing in to Apple ID. Extremely frustrated thanks in advance for any help Bob\n\nA: iPads can send and receive iMessages through your phone number because your iPhone associates its number to your iCloud account. According to Apple's troubleshooting steps and support forums, the first thing to try is to repeat the association process in case that's somehow come undone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggle iMessage off (Settings -> Messages) on both your iPad and iPhone. \n\n*Wait a few minutes. Some guides say restart your iPhone, which can't hurt. \n\n*On your iPhone, toggle iMessage on. If you see blue text below the toggle that says \"Use your Apple ID for iMessage\", tap it to sign in. \n\n*Once your iPhone has activated iMessage and lists both your phone number and email addresses in (Settings -> Messages -> Send & Receive), toggle iMessage on in your iPad's Settings. Your phone number should now be one of the \"Send & Receive\" options on your iPad. \n\n\nNote that receiving and sending non-iMessage SMS texts on your iPad is set up separately.\n", "Q: Is 128kbps too low-quality a file size for the iPhone 5? I've got a music collection of lossy M4A files at assorted bitrates that I want to transfer to my iPhone, and in order to conserve space I want to make each track as small as possible while keeping the quality of it indistinguishable from the original on my computer. I took a small portion of the collection (30 files) and re-encoded each one to two different bitrates to test: 128kbps and 192kbps (what I've been using up till now without any noticeable lack of quality from the originals). \nAs far as I can make out, the 128kbps files sound exactly the same on my computer as the 192kbps files do, so I'm considering making all of the music on my iPhone 128kbps, but I'm worried about whether these files will sound the same when I transfer them to my iPhone 5.\nIs it at all possible that my 128kbps M4A files will play at lower quality on the iPhone? Is the iPhone's playback quality a common bottleneck when it comes to music playback, or will it be able to play 128k files - or any other bitrate, for that matter - the exact same as on my computer? Just wondering whether others have similar experiences on this that could help me make a decision here.\nThanks!\n\nA: Qualification: I'm a professional sound engineer.  \nOpinion: By the time you're listening on the move, in the car etc, it's not going to make any difference.\nFact: You can keep your high bit-rate files on the computer & re-encode them on the fly when you sync your iTunes playlists to the phone.\nBest of both worlds.\nConnect your phone to iTunes, click its icon at the top [not in the sidebar] \n\nSelect Summary from the sidebar on the left & scroll the main area to the bottom > Options\nSelect 'Convert higher bit rate songs to... 128kbps AAC'\n\nThe first sync after this will be slower, as it does the conversions. After that, you'll not notice the difference.\n\nA: Lower quality in relation to what? If you listen to high-bitrate music through cheap headphones or earbuds, it won't matter how good the music is reproduced from the iPhone because the limitations of the hardware will 'color' the sound by not reproducing the source material properly through the introduction of distortion, frequency filtering and whatnot. If you are only using your iPhone for casual listening, the higher bit-rate is not necessary.\nThe proof, for you, is doing some comparisons of your own with identical tracks of various bit-rates on your iPhone, auditioned through the devices you will use to listen, whether it is headphones, earbuds, Bose noise-cancelling devices, car stereos, and what have you.\nWhat sounds good to you is what matters most. \n\nThat being said, much earlier models of the iPhone than currently available appear to be excellent music reproduction devices:\n\nConfirming what I hear with critical listening, the iPhone 5 is a\n  wonderful high-fidelity audio source. While publications funded mostly\n  by advertisements from makers of expensive cables, power conditioners\n  and outboard DACs don't want you to know this, the iPhone 5 is a\n  better audio source than most DACs will be when connected to a\n  computer or CD transport. The only difference is that the iPhone has a\n  level 6 dB lower than a proper CD player, but the iPhone still has\n  more output at 1 V full-scale than some outboard audiophile DACs!\n\n\n\n*\n\n*From Ken Rockwell's exhaustive testing on the iPhone 5 audio quality.\n\n", "Q: Why are some \"updated app\" dots brighter? Since updating to iOS 10, when I update my apps, some of the indicator dots are bright cyan instead of blue. For example, Deltek in the screenshot (compared to Sheets). Why?\nedit: In response to IconDaemon's comment, first, the light color was constant as I swiped to and from the page, with the background stationary. Second, I just checked again, and it's now the normal dark blue (see below). I didn't change the background or transparency settings. It might just be a bug, but I don't think it's an illusion or background interaction.\nedit 2: I just updated Facebook Messenger and it happened again. The dot is bright cyan, regardless of its position against the background. Then after I use the phone for a few minutes, it changes to the normal color. 3 images showing the bright color, followed by the dark color: http://imgur.com/a/evip7\n\n\n\nA: I noticed some of the dots on mine were a lighter color several hours after an update was downloaded, which would blow my theory about timing, so I tested changing wallpapers to see how that affected the color. This showed that the color of the dot is impacted by the wallpaper. It may be semi-transparent or the color may simply be chosen by the system based on the color behind it.\nThe below images were taken within a minute of each other after changing the wallpaper. The first two show changing from a light wallpaper to a dark one. The second, third, and fourth images were all taken with the same wallpaper. You can see the color darkens as the background darkens. In the fourth image, it even varies slightly between rows based on the differing shades in the background.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: How can I increase my scrolling speed with a third party mouse? Currently using a Razer DeathAdder gaming mouse with the driver software installed, and I have tried adjusting the scrolling speed in the system preferences in both Mouse Settings and in Accessibility (not sure why there is 2 different settings).\nIf anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I have to scroll through a lot of code when I work and my pointer finger is getting disproportionally muscular.\nUsing macOS Sierra on a 27 inch Late 2013 iMac.\n\nA: Figured out the problem. The Razer official driver takes over the mouse settings, but does not allow you to configure mouse scroll speed, and the setting was too low. \nWell that is annoying.\n\nA: Some 3rd party applications add more settings to control the behaviour of the mouse/trackpad. BetterTouchTool does that, for example.\n\nA: For me (using Razer ATHERIS  - MAC OSX 10.13.4) the solution was...\nDISABLE THE BLUETOOTH - AND CONNECT THE USB 2.4 DONGLE.\nThis made the scroll speed in mac preferences to work:\n\n(I have Synapse running and working to)\nUpvote if this work for you so people will know.\n\nA: I faced with the same problem when using Razer Atheris mouse at \nMac OS Mojave.

Exporting the playlists revealed some kind of dB table which I would like to process so I can replace the object MS path by the OS X path.\nAny suggestion?\nThanks!\n\nA: I found it was possible to export the playlists in XML format, which made life easier. \nAfter importing the playlists in OS X, 70% were correct, and the other playlists required some manual intervention. The problem was caused by the name of the songs which existed under several album folders. I have a lot of songs named \"track01\", \"track02\", etc...\n\nA: As long as in both iTunes libraries all your songs in your playlists exists, it should work, when you go to \"File -> Library -> Import Playlist …\".\nIf this surprisingly should not work, try the instructions given in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NvFIJ_VLus.

I use this in text editors to select everything above or below my text cursor. On the macOS Keyboard Viewer, when I press the combination, only the Command and Shift keys show as pressed down.Command+Shift+Left/Right Arrow works just fine though.\nI'm not sure what's going on. I haven't found anyone else with this problem on Sierra. I used to have Karabiner installed, but uninstalled it after finding it wasn't compatible with Sierra. I also had Karabiner Elements installed for a bit, but uninstalled it as well. Restarting doesn't do anything to change the problem. The problem occurs on both my MacBook Pro keyboard and my external keyboard.\n\nA: I think I fixed the problem by finding out there was a kernel extension named org.pqrs.driver.VirtualHIDManager from an old Karabiner installation that was running and causing this problem. It was in my boot volume at /Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-Elements/org.pqrs.driver.VirtualHIDManager.kext/. I didn't notice it earlier. Removing org.pqrs didn't work while I was logged in, so I restarted into my recovery volume, mounted my boot volume, and used the terminal to remove the directory. Everything went back to normal after that. Thanks to Monomeeth for the suggestions.\nI found the definitive problem. It turns out, the problem was caused by an application called Noiz.io on my Mac that launches on login. With the default settings, the application uses Command+Shift+Up Arrow or Command+Shift+Down Arrow as shortcuts for application volume. It apparently does so by hijacking the input of these keys so they don't even appear in Keyboard Viewer. I fixed it by removing the shortcuts from the application settings page.\n\nA: Since it works in Safe Mode (based on your comment) we know it's definitely a software issue. \nBasically, when you boot into Safe Mode your Mac will check the startup disk, only load necessary kernel extensions, and disable third-party fonts and startup options. Put simply, it won’t load third-party hardware drivers or startup programs.\nIt's likely (although not certain) that something to do with your prior installation of Karabiner is causing the problem. Your question didn't specify what version of Karabiner you had installed (besides the fact you also tried Karabiner Elements) or how you removed it. Assuming you've removed and deleted the application itself, there may still be other files installed. I would do the following:\nCheck the top level 'Library' folder of your hard disk for anything that looks like it's associated with your Karabiner installation. In particular, look at the following locations:\n/Library\n/Library/Caches\n/Library/Preferences\n/Library/Application Support\n/Library/LaunchAgents\n/Library/LaunchDaemons\n/Library/PreferencePanes\n/Library/StartupItems\n\nIf you find anything, delete the files.\nNow, also do the same thing with the same set of folders within your User's Library folder. To access this, within the Finder click on the Go menu while holding the Option key and select Library.\nLet us know how you go.\n\nA: In case you use Noizio app, it reserves Command+Shift+Down/Up for volume adjusting.\nYou can switch that off in Noizio > Settings > Shortcuts.\n", "Q: Windows 7 installer wont boot after creating partition for Bootcamp I'm trying to install Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro (13 inch Mid 2012) running OS X 10.7.5\nI'm using a USB drive to create the boot disk, and I also downloaded the drivers needed from the apple website. \nAfter creating the partition and restarting, the system tells me that there is no bootable drive available.

I'm a web developer and I have a Mac mini (late 2009) that I can leave always on in order to run it as a web server for my clients' sites that I work on (before I upload them to their servers).\nDo you know how can I set it up? Unfortunately I have dynamic IP. Basically, I want to access them remotely in order to show them to my clients and edit/develop them using my main Mac or my laptop.\nIt runs the latest version of OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 and I own macOS Server app v5.2.\n\nA: I am basing my answer what your requirements are\n\n\n*\n\n*Web Development.  Developing websites or web apps that typically run off a server; typically Apache/PHP/MySQL\n\n*Access the server remotely to edit/develop\nI belive this is much more than just screen sharing as you don't want to share your screen, just the website you are developing for a client.\nYou will need the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Web service listening on the appropriate port\n\n*Open/forwarded port on your router\n\n*Dynamic DNS (DDNS) with the ability to update your record\n\n\n\nWeb service listening on the appropriate port\nTypically, when doing Web Dev, this is Apache listening on the correct IP/Port.  Assuming that you have just one network adapter, you have to make sure that Apache (or whatever else you are running) is listening so that other computers on your LAN can access it.  If you can do this, then you are good to go for the next step\nOpen and/or forward the port on your router\nSo, you can get to your service from inside your network, but now it's time to get to it from the outside.\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine your local IP.  Using terminal, issue the command ifconfig en0 grep inet.  The line should start off with inet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.  That's your local IP address\n\n*Forward HTTP traffic to that port.  There are many routers on the market and each have different user interfaces, but they are all technically doing the same thing:  taking traffic bound to your IP and port and forwarding it to an address you specify.  You will have to check your user manual for the specifics on how to do this.\nBut, basically, you are going to forward port 80 traffic (HTTP) to the IP address you found in step 1.\nNext, you are going to want to test this out.  Use a service like IP Chicken or WhatIsMyIP to find your public IP.  You can even type the search directly into Bing and have it return your IP address.\nOnce you have that, you need to browse to it.  A smartphone NOT connected to your WiFi makes a good choice.  Point the browser of the smartphone to the public IP address you just obtained.  If you can see your page/application, your router is working.  If not, you need to go back and make sure your port forwarding is set up correctly.\nSetup DDNS\nThis is the final step.  Dynamic DNS allows you to use a domain name to access your IP even though it changes.  Many newer routers support DDNS in their firmware - you will need to check with your specific manufacturer and or model.\nEven if your router dosen't support DDNS, you are still in luck.  All you need is a DDNS client to update your record and it can run on any computer on your network.  For example, on FreeDNS's website, they provide a number of different clients you can on virtually every platform from Windows, to Linux and even iOS. \nSo, what you will need to do is install one of these clients on your Mac server so that it can periodiocally update your DDNS record\n\nA: *\n\n*Sign in to iCloud on the Mac mini\n\n*Enable back to my Mac mini\n\n*Fix any warnings or errors that are listed (it will prompt you to enable remote screen sharing if you haven't done that already).\n\n*Sign in to iCloud on your Main Mac with the same iCloud account\n\n\nThe Mac mini will now show up in the Finder sidebar as a shared computer as if it were on your local network. Setting up server app is a little more steps, so that's really better as a specific and separate question. The above steps will get you screen sharing so you can then set up server if / how you want.\n\nA: Are you able to get a static IP on the server?\nIf so, just go on the Mac - AppleMenu>SystemPreferences>Sharing..\nSet Screen Sharing ON (recommend for Admins), turn on Remote Login, and then using the Server App allow remote SSH..\nAt this point just use RealVNCVier - >  https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/\nHere's a handy guide for doing it both ways....\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/214220/how-to-access-your-macs-screen-from-windows-and-vice-versa/\nIf you don't have a static IP on the server, you're going to need to use iCloud or get a dynamic DNS (dyndns.com is your friend)..\n", "Q: Typing ~ on macbook pro keyboard I have a macbook pro 2015, and I've got the UK keyboard layout.

I have a MacBook Pro running Yosemite and my Photos Library is taking 235G of space so I want to back it up into an external hard drive and delete it from MacBook Pro. I am kinda new to Mac OS systems and never really understand how the Photos application works. \nI have my iPhone backups on this same MacBook Pro and have also done picture/video imports via the Photos Library application.\nThe Photos application shows my pictures / videos from 2007 up to 2016. \nBut I am confused that when I get into Show Package Content of the Photos Library and then the Masters folder, I only see year folders of 2015 and 2016. \nSo, my question is: From where is the Photos Library pulling together all of my media files? As you know, the Photos Library software does not allow us to right click a picture or video and reveal in finder, which is very annoying.\nThe bottom line question is: If I drag and drop the Photos Library package to an external drive, will I have successfully backed up my media and safe to delete them from my macbook pro? \n\nA: You can move the entire Library if you first Consolidate it from Photos' File menu.  \nThis will pull all externally referenced files into the Library, after which you can move it in its entirety to a new drive. Next Launch of Photos it will ask you where it went & you tell it.\nIf you then keep the 'Copy items to Photos Library' checked, then in future it will always ensure they are kept within the Library & you can delete any & all external files, should you wish.\n\nA: I notice from your screenshot of the Preferences window that \"Copy items to the Photos Library\" is not checked.  If that were checked, yes, you could back up the whole library once and for all by copying the .photoslibrary package.  But since you're not using that, unfortunately you're kind of on your own for everything except the 235 GB that's inside the package.\n", "Q: Mac file download behaviour Is there a way to prevent files being downloaded into the Downloads folder on a Mac such as when I open a PDF file from the browser instead of downloading it? \nTo explain what I mean, on Windows when you click 'Open' when the browser asks what to do with a file, the file gets downloaded to a temp folder. \nOn Mac it gets downloaded to the Downloads folder, in effect creating two copies if I choose to save the file later to a different folder. Since you can't move files on the Mac, the end result is a very cluttered Downloads folder and no way of knowing if a certain file is saved elsewhere? \nIs there a way to change this behaviour, say not to have the file downloaded or to have it automatically deleted?\n\nA: Just right click the link.\n\nIf you have a pdf viewer plugin enabled (which it sounds like you do), you have the option to *Open Link in...\" it or Save Link As...\nWhen you choose Save Link As... you even have the opportunity to change your download location.\n\nThe way that I am doing is through Full Acrobat Reader, not through a 3rd party plugin or Preview.

Why? So I have Server 5.2 running on a Mac mini, running OS X 10.11.6.\nI have two MacBook Pros trying to use it as a Time Machine server; the backup disk is offered to both MBPs when setting up Time Machine. I select Encrypted backups on both MBPs, and use the same credentials to connect to the disk on both, then enter encryption passwords for both.\nTime Machine is set up successfully on both MBPs. They also both have SMB and AFP enabled under File Sharing.\nOne MBP backs up using Time Machine just fine, the other says that the backup fails because the network username and password are wrong. It suggests re-adding the backup disk. I've done this countless times, and triple-checked the credentials used on the second MBP, but I can't get the backup to work.\nAny suggestions to advice? Thank you!\n\nA: So, the problem was that the second MBP needed the Time Machine server credentials User in all lower case. The Mac mini has a local user, let's say Arthur. I configured the second MBP to use the credentials Arthur/(a password) and the connection wouldn't work. Configuring it as arthur/(a password) worked just fine.\nThanks to Allan I found this by mounting two volumes from the Mac mini, one using SMB and one using AFP, and noticed that the AFP mount showed the user as 'arthur', and the SMB showed the user as 'Arthur', even though I'd logged in as Arthur for both mounts.\n", "Q: Error while trying to clean install OS X El Capitan (Apple ID auth error) I am trying to do a clean install of El Capitan using guide on support.apple.com.

I don't have any backups, so I really need to do this install.\n\nA: it's an Apple id problem.\nSolution:\nPower on your Mac and keep Command+Option+R (CMD+ALT+R)\nThen connect your wifi network and install without Apple id.\ni tested, it's work.\n", "Q: Identify Required Frameworks for an app I'm trying to make a disk image as small as possible with a few apps on it.  I need to find out what framework packages each app uses so I can copy them onto the disk image in order for them to launch.  How do I find this information?\nUsing the console, I've noticed that some apps generate error messages with the Framework name, but others do not.\n\nA: otool -L /path/to/yourapp.app/Contents/MacOS/yourapp\n\nThis returns a list of the frameworks that the app binary makes reference to. They are listed with the path to the framework which lets you find the binary for copying, or you can write a script to parse the output to do this for you.\nMake sure you run this command on the app binary, not the bundle.\nFramework paths beginning with ‘@rpath’, ‘@executable_path’ or ‘@loader_path’ are frameworks located within the app bundle, so as long as you're copying the app bundle you don't have to do anything special with these frameworks.\n", "Q: Font missing Characters Latin 1 Supplement. How to type them? I am typing in sanskrit, so, when typing in roman alphabet I need some supplements like  ā ṣ ḥ ś ī.\nMy font for the Roman alphabet is DV1-TTGanesh. When installing it (I have the copyright version), it says in the specification that it contains the Latin-1 supplement that covers those characters.\nThe thing is that when I write with that font, everything is ok until I try to use one of those letters that is composed of a dot and vocal, for example ī . Then, the font changes to Helvetica, for example.\nAt first I thought that the font didn't have those characters, and that was why it was changing the font.\nBut I figure out, that is not true. The reason is that I opened a text already written by another person, using DV1-TTGanesh, and those letters composed of 2 things, are nicely in the correct font, and are not changing.\nSo meanwhile, I have to copy the letter I need and paste everytime from one document to another.\nSo my question is, where are those letters? How can I find out how to write them? I use the keyboard screen but they are not there. There are just showing the elements separately.\nAny clues?\n\nA: To write transliterated sanskrit you normally use the ABC Extended (formerly called US Extended) keyboard layout.  To activate that you go to system preferences/keyboard/input sources and use the plus and add buttons, then you select ABC Extended in the \"flag\" menu at the top right of the screen.\nThe shortcuts for making the various diacritic marks you need are given in\nhttp://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemacext.html\nmacron above is option a, then the base letter.  dot below is option x, then the base letter.  acute above is option e, then the base letter.  āḥś\nFrom information you provided in the Apple forums, I think you may be using a Non-Unicode font, in which case the ABC extended keyboard will not produce what you need.  If this is the case, I strongly recommend you switch to Unicode, which has been the standard for this kind text for a long time already.  A non-Unicode font will make your work pretty much unusable for anything other than printing on paper.\n\nA: You can also use the Keyboard Viewer to show you the key-presses. This can be accessed from the 'Flag' icon at the top of the Menu Bar.\nGenerally the Alt- key alone is enough to give you the combinations for IAST Roman input that you want.\nTo type in svaras to these Roman letters, use Sanskrit Writer Lite app from Mac App store.\n", "Q: App Store update not working in Mac after upgrading to Sierra I have recently upgraded my Mac to Sierra.

Slow finder open/save as dialog boxes Whenever I click file-open or file-save as in any program, the finder dialog box takes a tremendous amount of time to open (approx 2mins). I have tried all kinds of solutions throughout the web and none have worked, not even temporarily.  Most of the fixes I have seen say that good patches came after Mavericks, but I am running sierra.  I have had the problem even throughout El Capitan, but it was barely a problem. On El Capitan the longest delay was maybe 10 seconds.\nA few things I have tried/noticed\n\n\n*\n\n*The problem occurs in safe mode, but it does NOT occur on the guest accounts\n\n*Going into Safe Mode doesn't fix the problem\n\n*Deleting the Finder plist doesn't work\n\n*Deleting Icloud caches do not work\n\n\nA: So after quite a few months of this problem going on.  I decided to sit down for a few hours and find the solution for myself.  Turns out, the solution was rather simple, but it might be a trouble point in other cases more than mine.  Ultimately, My problem was with Icloud.  After removing ICloud functionality from my mac, the problem instantly vanished.  Fortunately, I do not use ICloud at all and instead, opt for Google Drive.  For some, I say this might be a trouble point because it requires removing Icloud files.\n", "Q: New MacBook Pro 13\" (late 2016) with three external 4K monitors Considering getting the new MacBook Pro 13\" with four USB-C ports.  It is capable of supporting two 4K monitors out of the box, but can anyone help me figure out how to add a third 4K monitor?  Would this require something like a DisplayLink 4K adapter?  Thanks for any help.\n\nA: Apple says that the 13 inch MacBook Pro will only support two thunderbolt displays so you should plan to rent or be able to return any hardware purchases you make if you can't get three displays to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154\nI'm not saying it won't work even though not \"officially supported\" - just that it might not work even if you have cables and ports to connect all three devices due to driver or software issues and not cable/connection issues. You'd want a Mac Pro if you need up to 6 displays as they have the graphics horsepower to run those pixels in an officially supported configuration.\n\nA: Unfortunately the Microsoft Display Dock that Allan mentions doesn't help here. \nI purchased one specifically for use with the MacBook Pro and after testing: whilst the USB ports do work, neither the HDMI nor the DisplayPort are functional.\nIt's not clear if a driver update on either the adapter or Mac end of things could remedy this failure, but as of January 2017 there isn't a product to get 3 4k displays working once you have them connected physically.\n", "Q: How do I restore the icons of the Dock's Applications folder? For some reason, many of the applications' icons in the Dock's Applications folder were replaced by the default application icon. I've tried to clear the icon cache, but that didn't work.

And for that matter, why did this happen in the first place?\nI'm running MacOS Sierra on a MacBook Pro Mid 2014.\n\n\nA: Well, I restarted and did a first aid on the volume, and now it's working.

If so, this might confuse System Preferences. If this is the problem, then you could either bless the Windows partition from a Terminal application window or add a script to the menu bar that would accomplish the same operation.\n", "Q: Can I own an existing install of Logic Pro X from a used Mac? I'm looking at buying a used MacBook Pro on that comes with Logic Pro X that's running Sierra.\nHowever I need to roll it back to El Capitan so it will run my UA Apollo console software. It's not yet compatible with macOS Sierra.\nMy question is, since it's already on the computer, if I sign into my Apple ID before I roll back, will I then 'own' Logic Pro X so I can install it again after I reformat from the Mac App Store?\n\nA: The app, Logic Pro X in this case but it could be any Mac App Store app, remains tied to the account that purchased it, regardless of the currently authenticated account in the App Store app. Updating the app would require you to enter the Apple ID that purchased the app, and it is not possible to transfer ownership of an app from one Apple ID to another.\nIf you wish to keep the app, you can copy it to an external drive. The app is still linked to the old Apple ID, but you can use it either from the external drive or by copying it back after you've done whatever you need to do on the internal disk. You'll still not be able to update the app.\n", "Q: I can enter Time Machine even though the backup disk is unplugged! I have been using for some time Time Machine to backup to an external hard drive. I have just noticed todqy that even when my external hard drive is unplugged I can enter the Time Machine and go a few days back.\nHow is it possible? Is it a new feature introduced by Sierra?\n\nA: No - local backups were introduced with Lion. You can enable and disable them manually and they are turned on when MacOS detects a hard drive and portable Mac are separated or likely to run separately. The backups clear when you run low on space so most people never need to manage them. \n\n\n*\n\n*How to wipe huge .MobileBackups folder?\n\nA: It is called Mobile Backups and it have been on Mac for a long time, in short: \nEvery time you delete a file, it'll be moved to /.Mobilebackups where it'll work like a Time Machine Backup, but if you're low on Disk space it'll automatically delete the old backups.\n", "Q: Copy email from iPhone What I ask here is a completely LEGIT operation.

Random corrupted data occurs in the middle of somewhat \"larger\" downloaded files, e. g. JavaScript resources or any other source files with a file size around 1 ~ 2 MB. It seems the corruption comes up occasionally at file sizes < 1 MB, but quite reliable at file sizes above. The position and content appears to be random. I am attaching a screenshot containing an example of the file corruption which occured in a 1.4 MB JavaScript file.\n\nI never had any problems concerning this on macOS 10.10 or 10.11 and the latest issue results in very annoying consequences. E. g. I am not able to access JS-heavy web apps anymore. Furthermore it is risky to work in live systems of enterprise software when downloading, patching and uploading files. People around me using the same VPN on macOS 10.12 have the very same problem, whereas people still working on macOS 10.11 have no trouble at all.\nDoes anyone else experience this problem? How can I troubleshoot this?\nAlso relating to an older post in Apple Communities describing a similar (or the same?) issue in older macOS versions:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/30908122?start=0&tstart=0#30908122\nEdit 2016-11-08\nWhat's interesting: scp (SSH) downloads are interrupted by an error. \nxyz-macbook:Downloads xyz$ scp xyz@192.168.227.123:/srv/www/xyz/ext-5.0.1/build/ext-all.js .\nxyz@192.168.227.123's password:\next-all.js    0%    0     0.0KB/s   --:-- ETACorrupted MAC on input.\nssh_dispatch_run_fatal: Connection to 192.168.227.123 port 22: message authentication code incorrect\nlost connection\n\nWhereas curl (HTTP) downloads finish, but contain the above-mentioned corrupted characters.\nxyz-macbook:Downloads xyz$ curl \"http://192.168.227.123/xyz/ext-5.0.1/build/ext-all.js\" -o \"ext-all.js\"\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100 1952k  100 1952k    0     0  1728k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 1729k\n\nEdit 2016-11-11\nThe corrupted data is different with every download of one and the same file:\nxyz-macbook:Downloads xyz$ md5 dummy_novpn.txt \nMD5 (dummy_novpn.txt) = ca323efb28ed75534f8f6b7b0237d9da\nxyz-macbook:Downloads xyz$ md5 dummy_vpn.txt \nMD5 (dummy_vpn.txt) = 060bbe9846e7845993041a1481c34b93\nxyz-macbook:Downloads xyz$ md5 dummy_vpn2.txt \nMD5 (dummy_vpn2.txt) = dacfc661f9a85606afbdfefa72d50516\nxyz-macbook:Downloads xyz$ md5 dummy_vpn3.txt \nMD5 (dummy_vpn3.txt) = 8c3f06f9ee440947a9e5864748bd7010\n\n\nA: Do you happen to have a https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/TCDOCK11PSG/ ?\nI had the same issue, and it turns out if I moved the ethernet from the port on the OWC replicator, to a USB-C Ethernet, the problem went away.\n\nA: I experienced identical symptoms with a L2TP-over-IPsec tunnel using the built-in wireless interface on a MacBook Pro (2019) with macOS 12.6.\nAfter a bit of experimentation, the fix was to turn off RX hardware checksum offloading with:\nsudo sysctl -w net.link.generic.system.hwcksum_rx=0\n\nwhich resolved 100% of the data corruption issues. Since checksum offloading is a matter of performance, you may wish to reverse it when not using the VPN (i.e. reset the value to 1 rather than 0).\nIt is possible to persist the setting, if desired, by invoking sysctl at restart. To do so, paste the following into /Library/LaunchDaemons/sysctl.plist:\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n <key>Label</key>\n <string>sysctl</string>\n <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n <array>\n <string>/usr/sbin/sysctl</string>\n <string>-w</string>\n <string>net.link.generic.system.hwcksum_rx=0</string>\n </array>\n <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nand then execute\nlaunchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/sysctl.plist\n\nHowever, I hesitate to recommend doing so, since it may have performance and/or energy consequences.

Everything loads fine in the YouTube app and in Safari except videos. I can see my subscription list and recommended videos and I can also search and get results fast. But now just three days ago both stopped playing. I'm running iOS 10. I updated several weeks when iOS 10 just came out, but this is the first time anything is happening to youtube so I assume it's not the update. \nEverything loads but once I click a video, all I see is the rotating circle that means the video is loading.

Netflix also works fine, it's only YouTube that is having this problem.\nI've looked at a ton of tricks and such trying to fix it and tried all the ones I could find on my own, but none of them are recent. I'm willing to try just about anything at this point.\n\nA: Try a reset: Simultaneously hold down the Home and On buttons until the iPad shuts down. Ignore the off slider if it appears. Once shut down is complete, if it doesn't restart on it own, turn the iPad back on using the On button. In some cases it also helps to double click the Home button and close all apps from the tray before doing the reset. It's worked for me\n\nA: Well. You can do a clean iOS installation. Put the iPad in DFU or Recovery Mode and install iOS 10 from scratch. \nAlso...try other browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox first. \n\nA: Check your location. Make sure its not in a country that is blocked. \nAre you or your router using a VPN? \nContact the Youtube help team forum and see if they can offer some assistance as well.

The second item can also happen when your network is overloaded or there is general internet connection or routing issues.\n\nA: Not sure that this is your issue if you have an iPhone 5, but some brand new iPhone 6S's and 7's have been exhibiting similar behaviour recently:\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/05/iphone-activation-lock-wrong-apple-id-issues/\nThis message usually shows you some letters of the Apple ID that it needs the password for -- presumably they definitely don't match any email address you recognise?\nEither way, if you need to enter the password for an Apple ID that isn't known to you, then I'm afraid it's likely only Apple can help you sort it out.\n\nA: I have an answer, it actually took down the lock, go into your settings then go to your information, then go into icloud find the find my iphone tab, and tap on it and it'll ask if you'd like to disable it and then it'll ask for an apple id password and then it should be disabled, if for some reason your phone isn't letting you off the activation page, take your sim card out and it'll let you back into your home page and once you complete the above steps, put the sim back in. Good Luck \n\nA: I had this too, still trying to figure out why, not used find my phone.\nThe suggested AppleID is similar although I think it might be a Gamil variant, e.g. if my email was z*****@g**.com it is shoqing z*****@g****.com\nI was reluctant to enter anything into the phone in case it had been hacked, I connected the phone to iTunes but it would not let me baclup, instead it took me to a page giving a similar error (Activation Required) and asking for my AppleID and Password. \nI figured was unlikely both phone and Laptop hacked so entered my credentials.  \nThe phone unlocked and I was able to access my data and do a backup.  I still do not know what kicked off this Activation Required, it said it was because someone had done find my phone but there was nothing about that when I logged into icloud via browser.\nI gather that  it might have been caused by a former owner of my phone with a different iCloud issuing a Find My Phone via there account..\n", "Q: Mouse clicking not working on Disk Utility screen. How do I select erase button? When I returned home a couple days ago, I had a notification that some updates had been installed. This had rendered my 27\" iMac basically useless. It lags horrendously with almost a never ending spinning beach ball cursor. \nI'm trying to delete the HDD contents and reinstall the os, but when I boot to Recovery Mode to get to the Utilities screen, the mouse pointer will move but it will not click. I was able to figure out how to use the keyboard to get to the Disk Utility section but I cannot find out how highlight the erase button using the keyboard. If someone can come up with an answer or easier method, I'd be forever in your debt.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you want to select a drive and erase it. However, while you've worked out how to select the drive using the keyboard, you're not able to select the Erase button.\nIn your situation you can do this with by using the ShiftCommandE keyboard shortcut.\nHope this helps.

I can't quit Preview either, so the only way to close Preview for me when this happens is to force quit Preview.\nClicking on duplicate doesn't work because my edits made to the original document don't carry over and Preview still doesn't quit.\n\nA: I realised this is a bug in the Mask tool. Remove the mask and the image saves without any problem. Avoid this tool until Apple addresses the issue. Checked on High Sierra 10.13.4.\n\nA solution to this is to take a screenshot of the image preview before saving it(solution from @gpbl).\n\nA: I was facing the same issue, I finally got the issue resolved by following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Go to File\n\n*Click option 'Export as pdf'\n\n*Save the file name with pdf extension (like 'file_name.pdf')\n\nThis worked for me, so give it a try.\n\nA: Problem: Another common reason for this issue is the PDF file is password protected.\nSolution: You can remove the password (if you are allowed) using a free tool like Smallpdf\n", "Q: Migrate Google Authenticator to new iPhone 7 Just got a new iPhone 7, but when it restored it lost all my Google Authenticator two factor auth codes. I still have them all in my old phone, how can I port them to my new iPhone 7?\nThis is quite frustrating.\n\nA: First, two things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep your backup codes\n\n*Keep your old phone\n\n\nFrom what I have found, you will need to use the \"change\" option on each of your 2-step verification enabled apps/sites. This will most likely require you to log into each account using your current 2-step verification process first (hence the use of backup codes or your old phone).\nIf you have trouble transferring the authenticator application over, try the following tutorial.\nhttps://www.brianckeegan.com/2016/09/how-to-transfer-googles-2-factor-authentication-to-a-new-iphone/\n\nA: Unfortunately, you cannot transfer your tokens from one device to another. Only Google offers an option to transfer the secret key to another smartphone: you should go to 2-step verification page and click ‘Change phone’ and scan the QR code by your new device. Please note that this option works only with the Google Account. For all other accounts you should disable and then re-enable 2FA: go to account settings and turn off 2FA (you will be asked to provide an OTP generated by your old phone). As soon as you disable 2FA you can issue a new token on your new iPhone. \n\nA: For those like me, 3 days ago Google has updated Google Authenticator and add the ability to transfer accounts. Use the three dots (top right) then \"export accounts\". If you have more than 10 2FA, you would need to do this multiple times.\n\nA: The above appears to be two different issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Authenticator - An independent app for storing and generating token codes based on the Time based One Time Password (TOTP) protocol. Google Auth can be used by a variety of independent and unrelated services and applications.\n\n*Google G-Suite (email, calendar, drive etc.) that can use a number of different two factor protocols and apps (including Google Auth above or SMS) for login authentication.\nIn the case of number 1 above there is not a 'simple' way to backup and restore tokens, which is by design. However there are hacks and workarounds including apps like authy and screenshotting token barcodes (yeech defeats the purpose).\nIn the case of number 2, G-Suite provides backup or static emergency codes as referenced by norcal above permitting login when the authenticator device/token generator is lost or not available.\n\nA: I was in the same situation when I was upgrading from iPhone 6 to iPhone 6s. Unfortunately, I can't tie all of those to my google account and sign in on the new device. Even if you plug in you're iPhone via iTunes and make a back up, then restore the back up, it will not carry the data to you're new device.\nYou have to manually re-add them to you're new device. \nSince then, I stop using Google Authenticator and tried Authy. I like every single aspect of it. \n\nA: Uhm unless I am missing something, Google has the easiest methods of getting codes back. It was actually the only easy process I had when I lost all my data from my old phone.\nThey actually offer a webpage that allows many ways to get your codes back.\nhttps://www.google.com/landing/2step/help.html\n", "Q: Force Messages to use SMS for specific contact rather than iMessage? Essentially, I would like to set my phone so that all my outgoing messages to a specific friend, with whom I currently text back and forth over iMessage, are sent out over SMS, never iMessage. Additionally, I would like to block any incoming iMessage texts of his and (hopefully) they'll fail and be resent via SMS.\nLet me restate that: I would like to force SMS for both parties, going both ways, for a specific individual contact. \nIs this possible? Blocking any usage of iMessage between myself and this other individual, so they must either send and receive any texts to or from me via SMS (or the texts fail/never arrive). \n\nA: iOS 13 and below does not implement a setting on a per contact basis to prefer or force SMS over iMessage/APNS/Messages secure message delivery.\nYou could do two things to force SMS delivery from iOS. \n\n\n*\n\n*disable Messages for the duration of your need to text only via SMS and cellular protocol.

But if we've started to use iMessage then they won't get it until they go home and connect to the internet because I've essentially e-mailed it to them.\n\nI have shared a workaround in an answer here. Here's the workaround:\n\nForce Messages app to send a text message as SMS instead of an iMessage\nHere's a workaround that you can use to force the Messages app to send a test message as SMS instead of iMessage to a contact's phone number. It is slight clumsy, but gets the job done in the scenarios like you described:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have Internet access available on your iPhone via either Mobile data or Wi-Fi (indicated by the presence of appropriate icon in the iPhone's status bar), and the receivers contact number is registered with iMessage, you'll only be able to send an iMessage, irrespective of the online/offline status of the recipient. You can check if a message would be sent as an iMessage by the presence of a blue colored upward facing arrow besides your typed text message.\n\n\n*To force the message to be sent as SMS instead, temporarily turn off Mobile Data/Wi-Fi on your iPhone to disable Internet access. You'll still only be able to send an iMessage (Blue arrow icon) as your iPhone knows that the receiver is registered with iMessage. Send the message normally.\nThe message won't get sent from your iPhone due to the absence of an Internet connection. Now tap an hold on the message bubble, and you'll see an alert at the bottom of the screen with an option that says Send as Text Message. This option is not shown when you have Internet connectivity on your iPhone, or the message is already delivered to the Apple's servers.\n\n\n*This will cause your iPhone to re-send the message as SMS. The receiver will be able to get the message even in absence of the Internet connection on their device (as long as they have cellular connectivity on their device).\n\n*Don't forget to turn Mobile Data/Wi-Fi back on on your device to regain access to Internet.\n\nA: the handiest solution that comes to my mind is to remove your phone number as iMessage adress and use your AppleID instead. To do so go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*Messages\n\n*Send & Recieve\n\n\nDeselect your phone number and pick your AppleID for example.\nIf you want to chat with someone via iMessage, tell the person to use the picked address (in this example AppleID).\nIf you want to text via SMS, they should use your phone number. \nOnyl one party needs to do this, so your friend doesn't have to.\nAs of today (iOS 13.2.3) you can't specify/set rules for cases like this within the iMessage system.\nAlso you could switch to airplane mode before sending out a message, wait for the deleivery to fail (which should immediatly be the case), force to send via SMS and then deactivate airplane mode) + your friend has to do the same sending procidure.\n", "Q: Apple Watch Updated Time Zone Settings Recently time zone was changed in Turkey.

Maybe I should use different software? Even solution, that includes erasing of the data is acceptable at the moment!\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: You can actually divide external drives into several partitions. \nTo do so you just need to add a partition table to the drive using Disk Utility. Unfortunately that will render existing data on the drive unreadable by conventional means.\nSo in essence you'll need to copy your data to a backup, add the partition table, format the macOS partition and copy back your data. Then you can format the Windows partition and install Windows.\n", "Q: How to hide Dock on non-fullscreen desktop I want to hide Dock on non-full desktops.

Every time I select two photos from the gallery and mail them, the iPhone also adds two text attachments. How do I get it to stop that?\n\nA: This is the fault of Microsoft Exchange and not specific to iOS.\n\nThis happens because Microsoft Exchange Server is reformatting messages sent through it.\nThe Exchange server insists that message text must always be first and attachments must always be last. As soon as the Exchange software sees one attachment in a message, it stops looking for text, and treats anything else in that message as an attachment. Any remaining text sections are converted into attachment sections, and given fake file names (like \"ATT00001.htm\").\nAt this time, there is no way to make the Exchange server stop turning text sections into attachment sections. The only workaround is to include attachments at the end of a message, after text and after any signatures.\n\nhttp://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4981187\n\nThe body of a message is shown incorrectly as an attachment if you try to use an application in an Exchange Server environment to send a message that includes attachments\n\n\nApplies to Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Enterprise, Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Standard, Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Enterprise Edition, Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Standard Edition\n\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/969854\n\nA: This is a bug at Microsoft's end for Outlook accounts which use stock Mail app for iOS.

Disk utility seems to do use 32kb by default and there is no option to change this. Is there a terminal command to do what I want to do?\n\nA: To format a disk with custom (FAT) allocation block sizes use the -c option with e.g. sudo newfs_msdos -F 12|16|32 diskXsY. -F is the FAT type (usually FAT32 here).\nFirst get the disk identifier with diskutil list and the block size of the disk with diskutil info diskYsX | grep \"Device Block Size\".\nTo get the -c factor divide the wanted allocation block size by the device block size: e.g. 65536/4096 = 16. Acceptable values are powers of 2 in the range 1 through 128.\nAssuming the device block size is 512 Bytes in your case, the factor is 65536/512 = 128 and the resulting command is:\ndiskutil umount disXsY\nsudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -c 128 diskXsY\n\nAn additional -v name option will also add a name for the volume.\n", "Q: in my website data for my iphone & ipad are those websites that only i have looked at?

With your tabs visible, slide up and eventually you'll see a list of all pages currently open in Safari on your iPad, Mac, etc assuming you've logged into the same iCloud account and have chosen to sync Safari.\nThis is a great feature allowing you to quickly access a page you know you've got open on another device. For example, you may have researched a new fridge on your Mac and then you're in a store looking at fridges and can't quite remember something you read, so by getting your iPhone out you can either use the Tabs icon to quickly access what you know you still have open in Safari on your Mac, or go into the History to see what you had looked at.\nIf you're concerned about privacy, you can set up multiple user accounts on your Mac and have each one signed into a separate iCloud account. \nMy wife and I use separate accounts on our iMac and can each access our own separate browsing history, what tabs we have open, etc on our respective devices, .\nOf course, you can also switch off Safari syncing in your iCloud settings as well.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: What if you have never visited half of the sites that are on there?

With the new MacBook Pro with USB-C port I'm wondering what the best option would be to connect the monitor. It has both DisplayPort and HDMI ports. \nIf I purchased the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter could I then plug the Mini DisplayPort cable into the Thunderbolt 2 end? Would that work?\nAlternatively I presume I could get the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter which contains an HDMI port and then purchase a seperate HDMI cable. \nAssuming both solutions would work and ignoring cost is one solution superior?\n\nA: I would go for USB-C to DisplayPort directly. That would be one relatively inexpensive ($20 to $40 US prices) cable to do the job. Since your display won't charge the MacBook and do video over a single USB-C cable and you have several ports (display side and Mac side) - a dedicated cable would be my choice.\nI like the USB-C to HDMI adapter you mentioned for my MacBook since there is only one port and charging plus USB is needed, but on the MacBook Pro you have several ports and can use one per display without too much hassle. It will work for you, though - just not my first choice. \nApple even recommends against using the adapter you mention for bridging between a Mini DisplayPort device and thunderbolt 3. \n- https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154\n\nNote that although it uses a Mini DisplayPort connector, the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn't support connections to Mini DisplayPort displays. \n\nIf you only want two external displays, both 13 inch models of MacBook Pro are suitable. You'll need the 15 inch models to support 4 displays. That might be a non-issue if you only have one Dell display to connect.\n", "Q: Can I scan an ad hoc network to find all the connected devices and their IP addresses? I am trying to connect an IP Camera (with an onboard web server) to a Macbook Pro (OS 10.11). If I use a router it's very easy: they both connect to the router and then the Mac can log into the camera and see its image. \nI'd like to run on batteries and so I want to do away with the router.\nI've set up an ad hoc network with Create Network, and my IP Camera may be logging in, but I have no idea at what IP address.\nI've tried adr - a and ping 192.168.255.255 (because subnet mask is 255.255.0.0) but neither seem to work on an ad hoc network.\nIs their another builtin or add-on tool I could use?\nThanks.\n\nA: Normally devices should auto-assign themselves an address in the 169.254/16 subnet (i.e. 169.254.x.y) when connecting to an adhoc-network that doesn't offer a DHCP server.\nYou can use a tool like nmap from nmap.org to scan the subnet to find your camera.\n", "Q: How to create a link, for multiple users, to a network share, which itself is on a network share? Working Windows-based solution\nI've got a folder on a network share which works great in Windows.  It is basically an index of other available file servers.  It looks something like this:\n\\\\server1\\directory\n    Server2.lnk   <-(links to \\\\server2\\files)\n    Server3.lnk   <-(links to \\\\server3\\files)\n    Server4.lnk   <-(links to \\\\server4\\files)\n\nI'm trying to replicate this functionality in macOS, but I have run into these problems:\nAttempting to use an Alias in macOS\nI connected to //server2/files via Finder using Go -> Connect to Server.  Once I was connected in Finder, I created an Alias using for the //server2/files folder.  I then copied that Alias to the //server1/directory location.  The Alias works... as long as I'm using the same computer from which I created the Alias.  But if I try to use it from another mac, it fails.\nThe other mac doesn't even seem to recognize the file as an Alias file.  It has an icon similar to a terminal icon, and when I double-click it, the mac tells me that there is no Application defined to open the file.  I noticed that the original created Alias file doesn't seem to have any kind of extension, so I'm not sure how a different mac is supposed to recognize it as an Alias file.\nThe nice thing about a Windows .lnk file is that it seems to work reliably and consistently no matter from what machine the .lnk is accessed, whereas a mac Alias file seems to somehow depend on some configuration of the original machine where it was created.\nFor example, if I open the Alias file in vi, I can see amongst the garbled code that it includes at least the username used to access the Share, whereas I want each user that clicks on the Alias to access the Share using their own credentials (the mac is joined to AD and users login using their AD credentials).  Again, this works seamlessly with UNC paths and .lnk files.\nAttempting to use a terminal script in macOS\nI tried to make a simple script that mounts the shares.  So inside //server1/directory I created a file Server2.command with the following content:\nmkdir /Volumes/Server2\nmount_smbfs //server2/files /Volumes/Server2\ncd /Volumes/Server2\nopen .\n\nMy problem with this solution is that I have many servers and many users using the same machine.  One great thing about using the Connect to Server option in Finder is that it seems to automatically \"clean up\" the /Volumes directory.  After ejecting a share, or after ending a session, it removes the corresponding /Volumes/Sharename folder.  I don't see any way to accomplish the same behavior if I use this terminal-based solution.\nQuestion\nCan someone give me a good way to replicate the .lnk functionality I have described above?  \nI know the Windows links functions via UNC paths, whereas in macOS I can only access these network shares via smb or afp mounts, but since I see that the Connect to Server option pretty much functions how I need it to, I just need a way to use that same functionality, with the caveat that I need to automate it, because I'm not going to ask my Users (I have many Users using the same machine) to each create a Connect to Server Alias manually.\n\nA: Found the answer.  You must create an .afploc file.  This is similar to an .inetloc file.\nThe easiest way to create a .afploc file:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Finder\n\n*Go -> Connect to Server\n\n*type the address in the Connect to Server window (e.g. afp://server.domain.com/\n\n*highlight what you just typed (afp://server.domain.com)\n\n*grab what you just highlighted and drag it to the desktop (or any folder, presumably) and release\n\n*a file named server.domain.com.afploc should be created automatically on your desktop\n\n*you can then copy that file anywhere and it will function to automatically start the Go -> Connect to Server process on any mac computer\n\n*you can also rename the file if you want, and you can edit its contents to create other .afploc files that point to other servers or paths\n\n*you can also use this same process and substitute an smb:// path.  this creates an .inetloc file which works the same way\n\n\nA: To complement Daniel's answer, it may be worth noting that these .afploc or .inetloc files are just plain XML plist files. So you could also generate them by hand or from a script. An example file for an smb share looks like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>URL</key>\n    <string>smb://server/share</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nSo if you have many such shortcuts to define, you could have a file like this:\n$ cat shares.txt \nserver1 share1\nserver2 share2\nserver3 other-share\n\nAnd then run this to generate .inetloc files for every server-share:\ncat shares.txt | while read server share; do\n  cat <<'EOF' >\"$server-$share.inetloc\"\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n  <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n  <plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n      <key>URL</key>\n      <string>smb://$server/$share</string>\n  </dict>\n  </plist>\nEOF\ndone\n\n\nA: My feeling about what you want to achieve in Mac OS (or a Unix) works with a symbolic link.\nFinder has functionalities above OS embedded functions. I guess an alias won't work with Terminal / Shell.\nSymbolic links are created on the shell but also work transparent in Finder.\nTry out the thread\nBackup iPhone to external drive on Mac\n... this explains symbolic links wonderfully.\nHope, this was what your are looking for!\n", "Q: How to get all apps restored to an iPhone from a backup in iTunes? Just got new iPhone after backing up the previous iPhone I had. Set up the new phone as a \"new phone\" and then restored from iTunes backup. I found that many apps that I had on the old iPhone were not present on the new one now. (After a bunch of them sat there and said \"waiting\" right after I did the restore.) So there are a bunch of apps that are missing.\nThen I went to iTunes and found some of the missing apps and clicked on \"install\" logical right?  Then I try to \"apply\" this and get the message \"The app \"Southwest\" was not installed on the iPhone because the app could not be found\". (And a bunch of other apps.)\nOddly this is the same exact problem I had when I upgraded my wife's phone too a couple weeks ago. Does anyone know how to fix this and also keep the apps on the same page and folder as they were before? I know already I can go to the App store and re-download the apps yes but major time suck and a lot of time to re-arrange the apps again like I had them organized before.\nIs this a common problem?  It seems to keep happening to me. We just backup to the computer (not iCloud) since we would easily blow out the iCloud storage with the amount of data on the iPhones.\nI would have a hard time believing that this is something I did wrong. I simply run the backup and expect the backup should work.\n\nA: In order for itunes to restore your apps, the app must be in your iTunes library. It sounds like they are not. Which means iTunes can't restore them.\n\nA: Your iPhone can get apps from the Apple Store or from iTunes transfer. The typical problem it's been the version of the app that was on the phone when the data was backed up is no longer available to download. \nIf you want to protect from this in the future, be sure to transfer a copy of the application itself to your iTunes library. This ensures that even if Apple pulls an app from the store or if the developer pulls it from the store or if you need a version that's older than the currently available, you can still reinstall the version of the app corresponding to your backup. \nVersions of apps that are test or enterprise apps might need to be reinstalled - bit that usually is an edge case. \n", "Q: Python version different to Python Framework version When I ask for my system version in python interpreter, the answer is 2.7.10 :\nPython 2.7.10 (default, Jul 30 2016, 18:31:42) \n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.34)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import sys\n>>> print (sys.version)\n2.7.10 (default, Jul 30 2016, 18:31:42) \n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.34)]\n\nHowever, browsing /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions, I can only find 3.5, why?\n\nA: It is possible to have multiple different python installations on macOS. And the user is able to choose where they are installed. \nFor example, I have the standard Python that comes with macOS, as well as one that came with Anaconda that I use for my Python development.\nTo make things easier, I linked my system Python to Anaconda's Python interpreter. However, this does not delete the Python version in my system's library, merely stops linking against it.\nIf you're ever confused which interpreter is being used to run your code in terminal, I find a simple way to find out is to simply type the Terminal command \"which python\". That will quickly output the location of the Python interpreter being used by your system by default. In my case it outputs \"/anaconda/bin/python\".\n\n", "Q: Trouble creating directory from script run by launchd I have a simple script that creates a new directory based on the date then copies a set of files to that directory.

I'm trying to figure out if my Mac's hard drive could be failing, or that it could be some other component or the HD cable.\nAfter transporting my Mac about a week ago it started beachballing a lot. I mean a LOT, like every time I try to change the window or do anything, it will beachball from anywhere between 10 seconds and a few minutes. I was using Caffeine before to stop the laptop from falling asleep and I am afraid that maybe I left Caffeine on during the transport, which could have damaged the drive, but I am not sure.\nThe most notable thing is that any operation that involves the disk itself seems to be very very slow.\nI tried DiskWarrior for example and it took a day and a half to rebuild my directories from status 8 to status 10, which didn't help the performance of the computer.\nI also tried DriveGenius to scan for physical errors. It took about 12 hours to get to 26% (and this was not the \"extented test\") and found two \"dubious areas\", after which I cancelled it cause it would probably take another two days to finish.\nEtreCheck indicated some HD errors in its SmartREPORT.\nDownloads and copy operations (such as the back-ups that I did) will sometimes be fast and then become very slow and/or freeze for a couple of minutes. Sometimes they will then continue, sometimes not.\nBooting is no problem even though slightly on the slow side, except in safe mode which I left for 45 minutes and the percentage bar went all the way until the end but it never booted up.\nThe HD doesn't make any weird noises. I haven't had any messages about possibly corrupted data.\nI'm basically trying to figure out if I should go through the trouble of buying a new HD cable, or if I should just replace the HD immediately, or perhaps try to low-level format the disk and reinstall everything to see if that might get rid of possible bad blocks.\nSpecs:\nMacbook Pro Mid 2012 with El Capitan\nApple Toshiba 500GB drive with 45GB free disk space\nRecently updated 8GB non-Apple RAM\nI updated my important files -

It took about 12 hours to get to 26%...\n\nand\n\nDownloads and copy operations ... will...sometimes be fast and then become very slow and/or freeze for a couple of minutes.\n\nand\n\nBooting is no problem even though slightly on the slow side, except in\nsafe mode which I left for 45 minutes and the percentage bar went all\nthe way until the end but it never booted up.\n\nA drive doesn't need to \"make noise\" as a symptom of failure - noise is usually an indication of a bad motor, bearing, or servo (mechanical parts) that are worn.  Failing read/write heads or defects in the surface of the platter would make no noise at all.\nEverything else listed that indicated slowness or non-booting are all symptoms of drive failure.\nOne quick way to check the SMART status of your drive, is to issue the following command in Terminal:\ndiskutil info diskX | grep -i smart\n\nWhere \"X\" is the device number of your drive.  You can find out what the number is, if you don't know it, by issuing the command diskutil list and locating your particular drive.  But, for a MacBook, it's more than likely disk0 since you only have one drive.\nIs your cable bad?\nPossibly, but not very likely.  Cables don't go bad unless you do something to them.  Unless you opened up your MBP and did something that required manipulating the drive cable, you can assume all is well.\nShould you low level format?\nNo.  You have a physically failing disk; low level formatting can't fix it.  A lot of people like to \"stress\" the drive as an attempt to repair it; this makes zero sense.   If you have a failing transmission in your car, would you drive it harder or tow a heavy load as an attempt to fix?\nYour fix:  Replace the Hard Drive\nThere's no way around it, you are going to have to replace the drive.  There's also no convenient time for a drive to fail but it only gets worse the longer you wait, so replacing it sooner is always better than later.\nThe Good News\nNow's an opportunity to install an SSD.  Your particular MBP will support standard 2.5\" SSDs which are not at all expensive.  A 1TB SSD at the time of this writing is now under $220 and a 120GB is under $40!\n\nYou mentioned that you \"updated\" (I'm taking that to mean you \"backed up\") your important files; this is good.  However, your drive wasn't big enough to do a full clone.\nGet a USB to SATA Adapter to facilitate migration\nIf you do this sooner rather than later, you can use your old drive as an external drive and use Migration Assistant to move everything over.  All you will need is a USB 3.0 to SATA adapter that will turn any SATA drive into an external drive.  They're cheap and indispensable.\n\nReplacing your drive\nReplacing it is super easy.  You basically remove the 10 Philips screws on the back cover to remove it and the two screws holding the drive bracket:\n\n\nWhen you remove the cable, just be extremely careful - meaning don't pull too hard.  Ifixit.com has an excellent step by step guide to walk you through this procedure.  Just reverse the steps to install your new drive.\nGet an external drive for Time Machine\nLast but not least, get an external drive to have Time Machine backups of your computer.  Yes, it's another $60 or $70, but the question is, how much would you be willing to spend when your drive fails and you don't have a backup?  That $60, in retrospect, would be super cheap.\nMake sure you have everything you need before you begin\nWhen you undertake this, make sure you have installation media, meaning a USB installer of El Capitan or Sierra.  This means you would have to download it and create your USB installer before you do start this.  Make sure you have:\n\n*\n\n*The replacement parts (new SSD and USB to SATA Cable)\n\n*The right tools #00 Philips screw driver\n\n*4GB USB flash for the USB installer\n\n*A fresh backup of your important files\n\n*Serial numbers (where applicable) of applications you wish to reinstall\n\n*The new USB drive to set up and do your first Time Machine backup\n\nOnce you do this repair and upgrade to an SSD, not only will you see increased reliability, but much, much higher performance than you previously experienced on your MBP.\n", "Q: Moving files from Desktop to another folder and vice versa using AppleScript (and bash inside of Applescript) inside Automator I need to move files from my desktop to a folder ~/Documents/Desktop migration and I have tried to code a script which will do that. Unfortunately, (and the reason why I'm asking here) it doesn't work.\nI am using a service (so that I can go to any application's menu bar > Services > (insert name of service here) ) and need to store the variable data, so I think automator is suited for the job, and I'm using AppleScript and Terminal to move. \nWhat doesn't work is it only transfers files to the desktop from the Desktop Migration folder and not back from the desktop to the Desktop Migration folder, so how can I achieve this?\nWhat I've come up with so far:\n\non run {input, parameters}\n    set theQuery to input\n    if theQuery = 1 then\n        do shell script \"mv ~/Desktop/* ~/Documents/Desktop\\\\ migration\"\n        set output to 0\n        return output\n    else if theQuery = 0 then\n        do shell script \"mv ~/Documents/Desktop\\\\ migration/* ~/Desktop\"\n        set output to 1\n        return output\n    end if\nend run\n\nThanks!\n\nA: So it looks like you'er trying to set a flag that toggles each time the Service runs, and there is more than one way to accomplish this.\nIn this example, I created an Automator Service named Test Service, with the settings shown in the image below, and added a Run Shell Script action, as this is all you should need to accomplish the task since you were using a do shell script AppleScript command anyway to do the work.\n\nAs presently coded, each time the Service runs it says what the flag is set to, 0 or 1, and sets it to the opposite. You'd of course remove the say... commands replacing them with the code you want to run based on the setting of the flag.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfile=\"$HOME/Library/Services/Test Service.workflow\"\n\nflag=\"$(xattr -l \"$file\" | awk '/com.TestService.flag/{print $2}')\"\n\nif [[ $flag -eq 0 ]]; then\n    # Do something...\n\n    say \"flag is currently set to 0, setting flag to 1\"\n\n        # Set flag to 1.\n    xattr -w com.TestService.flag 1 \"$file\"\nelse\n    # Do something else...\n\n    say \"flag is currently set to 1, setting flag to 0\"\n\n        # Set flag to 0.\n    xattr -w com.TestService.flag 0 \"$file\"\nfi\n\n\nThis uses xattr to set an extended attribute on the Automator's Service .workflow file and it is this that is read each time and changed each time the Service is run and this is the flag to determine which branch of the if statement runs in the script.\nYou can either manually set the com.TestService.flag using xattr in Terminal before you run the saved Automator's Service so as to have the extended attribute applied to is .workflow file or if you just run the saved Automator's Service the first time is will set it to 1 as it reads the empty flag variable the first time as being equal to 0.\nThe following output from Terminal shows the extended attributes of the Automator's Service .workflow file when it was first saved, it just had the com.apple.FinderInfo attribute set, and then the Service was run a couple of times to show that the com.TestService.flag attribute was set and changed each time the Service was run. (I manually ran the xattr command before and then in-between each time I ran the Service to have this output to show.)\n\n$ xattr -l \"$HOME/Library/Services/Test Service.workflow\"\ncom.apple.FinderInfo:\n00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020\n$ xattr -l \"$HOME/Library/Services/Test Service.workflow\"\ncom.apple.FinderInfo:\n00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020\ncom.TestService.flag: 1\n$ xattr -l \"$HOME/Library/Services/Test Service.workflow\"\ncom.apple.FinderInfo:\n00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020\ncom.TestService.flag: 0\n$ \n\n\nObviously you can change the name of the flag from com.TestService.flag to whatever you'd like however remember to change it in the script in all three places, in the awk command and in each xattr command in each branch of the if statement. Also change the name of the file variable as appropriate for the actual name of your Automator Service .workflow file.\n\nA: Try with a Terminal command, it’s very simple·\nType rsync -av, press once the space bar and drag the folder to the Terminal window. Drag the destination folder to the window and hit Return.\nThat’s it !.\nThe original folder (files) remains intact in their position.\n", "Q: MacbookPro Won't Boot without Live USB-Key.

Is there any way to check the EFI Partiton? OS X works fine in itself, and i'd appreciate to avoid a re-install, as my bandwith is not so good it takes a lot of time...\n\nA: You can mount the EFI partition with diskutil mount /dev/disk0s1\nIt should be empty, save for some firmware files etc in the APPLE dir - it's not normally used for the bootloader, but does make use of applicable files there if it can find any - so it is indeed a good guess that there is something in there throwing it off. The reason it works when you start by booting externally is likely the clean ESP on your external USB.\nYou can have a look around, and if you wish, just nuke the entire contents - again it's not used for booting OS X and anything in there will be recreated as needed, on the Apple side anyways.\n", "Q: Unlocked IPhones 5s Gets locked after inserting SIM Bought iphone 5s and it's previous owner  removed icloud account on it. \nI created my own icloud account and associated with it.\nEverything is ok, but when i insert a sim card, it requres me OLD icloud credentials (one which was used by previous owner). \nIf i enter my own credentials it says : \"this account could not be used to activate phone\". \nIf i remove sim, turn phone on, and enter my credentials it works fine.\nWhat could i do ? (rather than contacting old owner who is remote)\nI'm not searching for any illegal (ticks or hacks) about bypassing Icloud.\n\nA: If you can visit the check page at https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/ and get a clear status from Apple for your serial / IMEI then the seller is correct that they removed the Activation Lock.\nThat is but one of the \"locks\" that can cause you grief. The next lock is carrier lock. Some phones that were sold under contract are locked to a specific cellular carrier's SIM cards. You need to get a card for that carrier (it doesn't need to be active) and insert it and then connect to iTunes or WiFi or cellular (with active data service) to complete that unlock. Depending on your location - you may be able to request an unlock if the original purchaser didn't complete their contract. You may also need the original purchaser to interact with the carrier in some cases to request an unlock of this device.\nLastly are SIM locks - it doesn't seem you have this last issue from the descripton of the error. (My guess is the device is locked to a carrier or an iCloud account per above) Please comment here if you get a screen shot or more details on the exact wording of the error you see on screen or in iTunes when you connect the phone to a computer.\n", "Q: Why does .tar.gz automatically extract the GZip archive when I download it in Safari?

And if so how? I've been searching for this forever...\nBy default EFI partition on Mac is 200 MB.\nI have a special Windows 10 image (enterprise compilation) I would like to install on the Boot Camp partition, which requires that the EFI partition be 500 MB due to the image installer boot.wim file size, which is 290 MB.\nThe way I tried to do this is first install MS Windows 10 image downloaded from MS website by using Boot Camp Assistant to create and prepare Windows partition, then startup from the USB drive that includes the Windows 10 Enterprise image, deploy the image on top of the Windows partition, and reboot starting up from Windows to continue installation, but because I cannot copy boot.wim file onto the EFI partition, the deployment process cannot continue.\nI've been trying different methods to change EFI partition size, using diskpart when starting up from the USB drive with the Windows image, or diskutil when starting up from macOS.\nNone of which allowed me to resize the EFI partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*With diskutil I get: \"File system format does not support resizing\".\n\n*With diskpart I get: \"You may not extend OEM, ESP, or recovery partitions\".\n\n\nIs EFI partition resizing even possible?\nDue to the fact that this is a relatively new Mac, I don't think I'll have any problem reformatting the drive for this to work, and reinstall Sierra from the Recovery Mode, if necessary (Of course if it's possible to change the partition size without losing data, that's the best solution).\n\nA: I used Rod Smith answer and comments @ https://superuser.com/questions/1142967/can-i-enlarge-mac-efi-partition-and-if-so-how and understood that the EFI partition does not have to be the first partition on the drive.\nSo basically I performed the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Marked the EFI partition as normal data partition\n\n*Created another 500MB partition, marked it as EFI\n\n*Installed the OS and moved the boot.wim to the new EFI and let the deployment procedure complete\n\n*After the deployment completed I marked the old partition back to EFI and deleted the new partition I created, and voila! the OS deployed successfully and the drive returned to its original state\n\n", "Q: In-app purchase or third party payment vendor for app subscription model for a physical device?

I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) with both discrete (AMD Radeon R9 M370X) and integrated (Intel Iris Pro) graphics. When this machine is connected to an external display, I find that the keyboard gets uncomfortably hot even when doing very light work, and it gets annoyingly hot when doing anything heavier like compiling code. \nI know that attaching an external display forces use of the discrete graphics adapter because the HDMI port and DisplayPort are hard-wired to that adapter. Unplugging the external monitor brings temperatures reported by the sensors down, and subjectively brings the keyboard back to \"body temperature warm\" instead of \"annoyingly hot\". A drop in temperature is observable even when the discrete graphics remain in use but only the external monitor is disconnected. \nI can see why the graphics processor uses more power and creates more heat when driving multiple displays, but my question is the following: does the equivalent machine with only integrated graphics show the same magnitude of heat increase when using an external monitor? Presumably the integrated Iris graphics will also get hotter when driving multiple displays, but will it get this much hotter? \nI don't have an Iris-only model around to compare, so I will supply some measurements from iStat Menus, and hopefully someone with the Iris-only config can take equivalent measurements. I will report the \"left fin stack\" and \"CPU PECI die\" temperatures, which react quite visibly to the use of an external monitor. All temperatures are measured with very low CPU activity, with any open applications essentially idling.\nWith a 1920x1080 display connected in a room climate controlled to a temperature of 25C, the left fin stack (LFS) is 51C and the CPU is 61C. A few minutes after disconnecting the display, LFS is 40C and CPU is 49C. After plugging the external monitor back in for a few minutes, LFS rises back up to 52C and CPU to 62C. The fans remained at around 2000RPM throughout the measurement process. So put simply, I get around a 10C increase in LFS and CPU temperature purely from plugging in an external monitor via HDMI.\nThe LFS temperature as reported in iStat Menus shows a nice smooth exponential rise and fall as one would expect:\n￼\nThanks in advance to anyone who can supply the other half of the information needed to answer this question!\n\nA: The short answer appears to be: yes, 12 degrees C (22 degrees F) or more cooler. \nI got ahold of a custom-build Macbook Pro that has identical specifications except that it had no discrete graphics adapter. I set it up on the same table in the same room, connected to an identical monitor. I put both of them through the same sequence of operations, using yes > /dev/null & one or more times to occupy whole processor cores, running WebGL demos, plugging and unplugging monitors, etc. in lockstep. Temperatures, fan speeds, and CPU use were observed regularly using iStat menus, yielding 120 separate observations. Using the R statistical package I fit some models to these data and retained this one for the \"left fin stack\" temperature:\n> summary(fin_fit)\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = fin_temp ~ dgpu + ext_disp + cpu_load + gpu_load,\n    data = heat)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max\n-12.1091  -2.8460  -0.2888   2.5413  12.1540\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The base operating temperature is about 33C, every fully occupied CPU core adds about 3.4C, a fully occupied GPU adds about 14C, each external display attached adds about 2.4C, and using a discrete GPU adds about 12C. All of these variables are very significant in explaining temperature variations, and the model as a whole is quite effective at predicting temperature.\nThere is an apparent jump of 10 watts or more in power consumption when using the DGPU and an external monitor. This would be coherent with the extra heat, but I did not fit a model for this response variable.\nI expect the fin heat model would fit even better if I excluded all observations that happened shortly after a change of state (change in CPU or GPU usage, change in presence of external monitor). There’s some amount of thermal inertia - it takes a minute for the heat sinks to warm up or cool down.\n\nConclusion: On the stock Macbook with a discrete graphics adapter hard-wired to the external monitor ports, from a temperature perspective attaching an external monitor has greater impact than performing heavy computations. The fans become audible frequently under load, and the keyboard can get uncomfortably hot. On the other hand, when using the model with no discrete GPU, the fans remain quieter and temperatures more moderate, as attaching an external monitor yields only a slight increase in base temperature.\nOther observations: the dual-GPU model will also enter and remain stuck in discrete GPU mode when it doesn't really need high performance graphics, which can discharge the battery very quickly and cause unnecessary heat. At one point in my testing after unplugging the external monitor, it became stuck in DGPU mode. The activity monitor reported that this was due to the Terminal application requiring accelerated graphics (!). \nComing out of sleep with a monitor attached or switching on an already-attached monitor, the monitor often seems not to be detected or used by the OS. GPU switching seems to add a lot of complexity and be susceptible to glitches.\n", "Q: How can I create a backup of my iMac when it won't start and recovery mode fails At this point I'm just trying to get a copy of my hard drive before I wipe it. \nI have an iMac running El Capitan and I am unable to login to my user account (spinning wheel of death).\nI've tried to start up in Recovery Mode and backup files using Disk Utility. \nAfter waiting several hours I got the error message \"The operation couldn't be completed. (com.apple.diskutililty error 3.)\"\nThis was the process I followed.\nWhen I try to re-install a new copy of El Capitan I get the error \"Unable to install because this disk has S.M.A.R.T errors\"\nWhat else can I try?\nHow can I create a backup of my hard drive? \n\nA: Have you tried starting your iMac in Target Disk Mode? \nTo do this, switch off your iMac and then boot it up again making sure to hold the T key down until you see an icon appear on the screen.\nIf that works, then you may be able to use this mode to access your Hard Drive from another Mac (or even a Windows PC). However, if using a Windows computer it has to have the right connections and also be able to read a Mac's drive, usually by having extra drivers such as MacDrive, TransMac, MacDisk, or HFSExplorer installed.\nSpeaking of connections, you didn't specify what model of iMac you have. Typically you would use an appropriate cable connecting the two computers via your FireWire or Thunderbolt port. USB is not supported.\nSummary \nIn a nutshell, if you can get your iMac to start in Target Disk Mode, you can connect it to another computer (almost always another Mac) and your iMac's hard drive will then appear as an external drive on the other computer. If so, copy whatever files you can from it to another drive.\nI should warn you though that it sounds as if your hard drive has failed, and doing this may not work. Also, even if it does, I wouldn't try reformatting it to continue using it. You really should replace the drive or use an external drive as your bootable drive.\nAlso, if you can boot from an external drive, another option is to just do that and try copying across your data that way (i.e. From the internal drive onto another drive). This avoids the need to try using Target Disk Mode.\n", "Q: Can the new 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" without Touch Bar drive a 4K display? I currently have an old MacBook Pro 15\" Retina from 2012, driving two monitors, a 24\" 4K monitor and a 21.5\" 1080p monitor.\nThis setup works, except for one catch - the 4k monitor refreshes at 30Hz, which makes it a bit laggy.\nI was thinking of getting the new MacBook Pro 13\" base model with 2 Thunderbolt/USB-C ports. Since I have 2 external monitors I figure I need the USB-C to Power + USB + USB-C adapter too.\nGiven I get these, will I be able to now drive my primary 4K display at 60Hz?\n\nA: From the Video Support section of the Tech Specs for the 2016 13\" MacBook Pro:\n\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and:\nOne display with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion\n  colors\nUp to two displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at over a\n  billion colors\nThunderbolt 3 digital video output\nNative DisplayPort output over USB‑C\nVGA, HDMI, and Thunderbolt 2 output supported using adapters (sold\n  separately)\n\n", "Q: OS X slow after switching users I have a 2010 MacBook Pro running OS X Yosemite with 4GB of RAM and 200+ GB of disk space. After switching users, the user who has just logged in is slow. Waiting several minutes or dropping to Terminal and running sudo killall -u $other_user -KILL seems to immediately show an improvement in performance. \nThe only consistent symptom I can find is that the other user has a number of processes, nearly all Chrome, using CPU cycles. I have not tracked this observation consistently enough to say if it is always true or not. When OS X switches users does it treat the other user as if the system were asleep or does it allow that users processes to run?\nKilling another users running processes is poor manners. Is there a better way to solve this problem? What can I examine to determine why the system is slow after switching users?\n\nA: The problem was resolved by swapping in an SSD.\nThe root cause may still be memory swapping. I am not sure if I was truly I/O bound or if the SSD just swaps fast enough to not be a problem.\n", "Q: How do make iOS autosave received iMessage photos? I want to make sure all photos I receive in iMessage are saved to Photos app.\nHow do I change this settings?\n\nA: This is currently not possible.

In the past, my iPhone would notify me about this event though the set notification. This doesn't happen anymore as I now have to manually open the calendar app on my iPhone in order to make it sync the calendar events.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: So the actual solution was to go to:\nSettings > Calendars > Accounts > Fetch New Data > [My Account name] >and here tap on \"Push\".\nSelecting \"Push\" in\nSettings > Calendars > Accounts > Fetch New Data\nwas not enough.\n\nA: You will need to set your  calendar account(s) to “push” updates to your iOS device, or “fetch” updates on a regular interval. \nThe following steps apply to iOS 11.2.1 for iPhone. If these instructions don’t work for you and you’re running the same or a later version, please edit or comment as appropriate.\n1. Open your Settings app. \n\n2. Scroll to “Accounts & Passwords.” Don’t select “Calendars.” (Not intuitive, I know.)\n\n\n\n*In the new screen, scroll all the way down to “Fetch New Data.” Don’t choose “iCloud” or any other account yet. (Still not intuitive, right?!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*In this screen, choose the desired account for the calendar(s) that you want to affect and set it to “Push” or “Fetch.”  You may also want to turn on/off “Push” at the top, depending on your needs. In this case, I have “Push” turned on at the top and set iCloud to take advantage of the option. All others are set to manually check the accounts when I run the app. \n\n\n\n\nA: I found the fix!\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto: Settings > Accounts and Passwords > Fetch New Data (Visible below the list of accounts) \n\n*Enable Push (on the top)\n\n*At the bottom of the page you will find Fetch description which by default would be set to Automatic. Now in this mode, the phone fetches data in the background only when on Power and WiFi. Therefore **change the choice from Automatic to Hourly (**or 30 mins or 60 mins)\n\n*Now on the same page open the Calendar account which you want to sync in background and select Fetch (and not Manual)\n\n*Done!\n\n", "Q: Remove folders in ~/Library/Mobile Documents There are some folders in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ (like XXXXXX~com~companyname~appname) which seems to be left by apps I already removed from all my devices. However, if I delete those folders, they restored back almost immediately. They are not visible in Finder or in iCloud management in System Preferences. How to get rid of them?\n\nA: Those should be the same apps listed under System Settings/iCloud/Manage... (button down right next to the bar), so you can delete them there.\n\nA: Have you tried a 3rd party app like 'App Cleaner'?  it removes files that are left behind when you just delete an app. It may work in your case.\n\nA: You cannot do that, this is how iCloud works. \nThese folders are how iCloud is designed to work, so you can stop using iCloud or forget about your intentions for a 'clean system'; sorry for saying this but you are not using a Linux flavor. \nSo, iCloud is not designed to allow you to micromanage it. The folders will be empty if you have no data in that application. \n[Upadate]\nThis method isn’t working \n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) keboard and trackpad are not working As title suggests, keyboard and trackpad are not working. However, force quit (shift+control+alt/option+power) had worked.\nWhere is the problem and how can I fix it?\n\nA: In this model the trackpad and keyboard plug into the logic board directly, the top case just houses it but has no logical components for those in it. \nThis issue might not actually be the logic board, if I remember correctly the logic for the keyboard goes to the logic board, route back through the trackpad then back to the logic board via the trackpad IPD cable. \nSince you've already reset the SMC and it didn't permanently fix it, I would first try another IPD/trackpad cable, if not resolved then try replacing the trackpad itself next. \nIt's unlikely to be the keyboard, hopefully not the logic board. \n\nA: Well, in layman's terms, your computer has crashed because of some application overloading your memory (heap) or got stuck in some sort of infinite loop! That is why nothing works (it's not just your mouse and keyboard, it's everything), but when you press an interrupt key, since it has a higher priority than normal processes, it prevents the CPU to continue the task and pops up the force quit tab. Just figure out what is choking your system via Activity Monitor and kill it.\n", "Q: iTunes iPhone Update Error Code 45 I'm trying to update my iPhone 5S to iOS 10.1.1 (current: iOS 9.3.2). I downloaded the ipsw through iTunes and tried updating my iPhone.\nHowever, I am getting error code 45 after iTunes says \"extracting software\".\nMy iTunes is up-to-date, and so is my Mac. I did check Apple's error code page but 45 isn't listed there.\nAny idea what I could do w/o restoring my iPhone? (I forgot to back it up before updating)\n\nA: Take a look at The iPhone Wiki's website where it states that Error 45 is:\n\nSame with Error 6, in terms of resizing partition issue. But this may occur at the very beginning of restore process.\n\n\nWhereas on Error 6 they write:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Not enter the downgrading mode, change USB port (the back one of chassis is better) and restart computer.\n  \n*Unable to resize partition due to full storage problem at final stage of updating firmware. The error may be bypassed (restart and do exit recovery) but you probably need to re-update it one more time.\n  \n\n\nA: Error 45 could be done by restore, if you are updating so it will give you the same error 45, so restore your phone.\n", "Q: Can you pair macOS and iOS device with same Magic Keyboard and switch between them? I have a Magic Keyboard and use it on my MacBook. I also want to use it occasionally on my iPad.\nAs soon as the Magic Keyboard was paired to a device and is then paired to another device, the Keyboard cannot be paired to the first device again, except if you \"forget\" the Keyboard and discover it as new one.\nThis AskDifferent Question from 2011: Can you pair Mac AND iPad with same Apple Wireless Keyboard? solves this for Apple Wireless Keyboards, but does not work for Magic Keyboards anymore.\nCan you pair macOS and iOS device with same Magic Keyboard and switch between them without having to set it up as new device everytime?\n\nA: No - Apple's firmware on the keyboard remembers the last paired device.\nSome bluetooth keyboards can switch back and forth, but that feature isn't available on Apple's current hardware.\n\nA: This works for me. I have an iMac (late 2013) and an iPad Air 2. I have set up my Magic Keyboard to be recognized by both devices. You can force pair a 2nd connection by holding down the power button on the Keyboard (maybe you are missing this step). You don't want either device to \"forget\" the keyboard. Once you've done that, you can then disconnect the keyboard from the iMac (in your case Macbook) using the bluetooth drop down in the finder menu bar, then connect to the ipad using the Bluetooth settings on the ipad. When you want to switch back again, first disconnect (don't choose forget) on the ipad bluetooth settings (using the (i) in a circle) then go back to the bluetooth menu/Keyboard option on the iMac finder menu and choose connect. I don't have to turn off bluetooth completely on either computer.\n\nA: You can remove pairing from the Mac when you hold Shift-option and click the bluetooth symbol on the menu bar. Bluetooth should be on. It then offers the possibility to remove it, whereupon it becomes disoverable again to the iPad. \n", "Q: Repeated Kernel Panic Can anyone decipher this, I've been having repeated Kernel Panics for a few months now.

really think it's the ram I have a 2011 MacBook Pro and it runs 16gb easily and I'm pretty sure you can even put in 32. I think you have malware on your computer. Your darwin kernel version is 16.1.0 but dated Oct 19. I'm pretty sure the authentic 16.1.0 is dated Oct 13. \nAlso a number of those kext are likely malware and linked to a mach rootkit. Your system would prevent from loading in safe mode. You can boot into single user verbose minimum boot and if you look closely at the output that probably will be pushed off screen quickly to see it block them. \nYou can do this by:\n - entering recovery mode (command R at startup)\n - opening the terminal\n - nvram -p (to see your nvram configuration)\n - nvram -c (to purge the nvram configuration)\n - nvram boot-args=\"-x -s -v debug=0x14e cpus=1 -no-zp=1\" (to get your computer to boot into single verbose safe boot on one cpu in debug)\n - reboot\n - read the output from single user-I use my iphone camera on slow\n   motion to get what it says since it all disapears really quickly. You\n   can try taking of the cpus=1 or changing to a different cpus 0-3 or\n   0-7 depending if your processor is quad (8 total for quad, 4 for\n   dual)\n - when you're done with all that nvram -c again to reset\n   boot-args/nvram \n - reboot\nAlso I would check the volumes you have mounted with diskutil list if you see 15-18 you need to run hdiutil imageinfo -debug to check if they're being saved as ramfiles (definitely malware related) the image path will look like ramfile:///[####] or ram:///[####]. I don't think you'll have that issue though on that computer \nAs for removing anything I'm not sure where this thing has a foothold but it's a pain to remove and Apple's solution has just been to give the person a new computer if the computer still has applecare in the cases I've heard others talking about. I think it's messes with the EFI in some way making it nearly impossible to actually delete and reinstalling the OS from recovery mode will show an 'unknown' process which starts doing all the questionable stuff in the installer log. Apple has been less than useful and this stuff goes over AppleCare call center reps' heads (there's thousands and thousands of them probably averaging 4 months on the job with almost no actual expertise and many don't even own a Mac).\n", "Q: Combine powerpoint presentations without changing template/background? I have multiple powerpoint presentations that need to be combined into a single presentation. They have different templates/background slides. This seems to be rather straightforward to do on Windows, but I can't find any online documentation for how to do this on a Mac.\n\nA: \nUnfortunately, this feature is not currently available in PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.

I've also tried the j flag, which is supposed to hide the app, according to the help:\nUsage: open [-e] [-t] [-f] [-W] [-R] [-n] [-g] [-h] [-b <bundle identifier>] [-a <application>] [filenames] [--args arguments]\nHelp: Open opens files from a shell.\n      By default, opens each file using the default application for that file.  \n      If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL.\nOptions: \n      -a                Opens with the specified application.\n      -b                Opens with the specified application bundle identifier.\n      -e                Opens with TextEdit.\n      -t                Opens with default text editor.\n      -f                Reads input from standard input and opens with TextEdit.\n      -F  --fresh       Launches the app fresh, that is, without restoring windows. Saved persistent state is lost, excluding Untitled documents.\n      -R, --reveal      Selects in the Finder instead of opening.\n      -W, --wait-apps   Blocks until the used applications are closed (even if they were already running).\n          --args        All remaining arguments are passed in argv to the application's main() function instead of opened.\n      -n, --new         Open a new instance of the application even if one is already running.\n      -j, --hide        Launches the app hidden.\n      -g, --background  Does not bring the application to the foreground.\n      -h, --header      Searches header file locations for headers matching the given filenames, and opens them.\n\nThe app opens in the foreground as if the I had simply called\nopen -a Franz\n\nAny idea why this doesn't work and an alternative?\n\nA: As of writing (10.14.3 Mojave), the correct answer is:\nopen -a /Applications/Skype.app -gj\n\nIf you do\nman open\n\nyou can see that \n\n-g  Do not bring the application to the foreground.\n-j  Launches the app hidden.\n\n\nA: If you call the command open with --hide (-j) it works (at least in macOS Sierra). For instance\nopen -j -a /Applications/Skype.app\n\nAlso, the -g flag helps some\nopen -gj -a /Applications/Skype.app\n\n\nA: You have to specify the -j and -g before the -a\nFor example:\nopen -gja /Applications/Calendar.app\n\n", "Q: How to use cmd + V to paste into a Ubuntu VM in Parallels?

Is there a size limit for generating thumbnails in finder?  Is there some way of increasing that limit?\n\nA: Finder will not generate thumbnails for files larger than 10 MB, unless it's a package with a Quick Look preview pre-generated, such as a large Pages document. It doesn't seem to be possible to increase the limit currently. You can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n", "Q: How to ssh in to a blowfish-based server from MacOS Sierra? We've got some embedded devices that we need to ssh in to sometimes in order to administer, but the devices' ssh server only supports the \"blowfish\" cypher.\nThis has been working okay, except that for MacOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple has removed support for the Blowfish algorithm, meaning that MacOS's built-in command-line ssh client will no longer connect to this device.\nGiven that we can't (easily) upgrade the embedded device to use a different cypher, what would be our best approach to connecting to this device from a Sierra-based Mac?  Is there some other ssh client we could use instead, or some way to re-enable blowfish support for the built-in client?\n\nA: Manual page for ssh explains the -c switch, which is used for the cipher specification:\nssh -c blowfish-cbc your_host\n\nshould do the job.\n", "Q: How does my iPhone change time zones automatically? I'm curious how my iPhone knows what time zone I am in and change automatically. Does the phone use GPS to figure out where I am in the world? Or is there some other technology in play here.\n\n\nA: It uses a combination of GPS and the date/time sent to the iPhone from the cell towers.  \nThere's several questions here about this same topic (different carriers and different iPhones) and they all have very similar responses to what I've said.  If you search for this topic, you can see all the different questions and answers; I just combined them all.  \n\nA: It is a SMART PHONE. (  as smart as the person using it. Meaning it has the capacity to do astounding things if you learn how to use it. )  You can use the settings function to set the phone to the time zone you are in and tell it to update automatically or manual. You can set it to a new time zone when you travel.\nSettings> general > date and time\nif the phone knows what time zone it is in then it know what time it is in that time zone. If you set it to alaska time but you are in new york it will give you the time in alaska ( because you told it is in alaska). If it is set to not set automaticly. \n", "Q: How to restore System Preferences.app without reinstalling? My younger brother decided to sudo rm -r /Applications/System\\ Preferences.app. Yeah, it was a pretty stupid thing to do.\n(In his defense, it's probably my fault for giving him bad habits--whenever I set up new macs, I always forcibly remove iTunes, Chess, and other preinstalled applications that I consider useless.)\nHe is currently running MacOS Sierra, and aside from the fact that he can't change any settings, his computer appears to be running fine.\nI told my brother to redownload the Sierra installer from the Mac App Store, use Pacifist to extract the System Preferences application, and copy it back to his applications folder.\nHe did so, but the newly-extracted System Preferences app doesn't work. It opens, but displays a blank window with no preference panes to click on. I advised him to do a reinstall, but he doesn't want to.\nHow can my brother get System Preferences back?\n\nA: Reinstalling the latest combo updater for Sierra is probably the first thing I'd try. Won't overwrite anything it doesn't need to, but should put back anything that's missing.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1918?locale=en_IE\n", "Q: iPhone 7 Won't Play Music on Bluetooth Headphones My iPhone 7 was playing music over my bluetooth headphones fine up until a few days ago.  Now all music just plays through the iPhone speakers instead.\nI looked in the Settings - Bluetooth and the headphones display as \"Connected\". \nThis is not a new headset; it was working correctly up until just a few days ago.\nWhen I power up the headset it gives me the same message it usually does when successfully connected to the iPhone, \"Power On - Connected\".\nIs there a setting somewhere that overrides where the audio outputs to?\n\nA: I realized that it stopped working after I updated to the latest version of iOS.  After going into the Bluetooth settings and \"forgetting\" the headphones and then re-pairing it worked fine.\n\nA: I was having the exact same problem but discovered that the volume had been set to zero. I didn't do that. I don't know how that happened. But just increasing the volume solved the problem.\n", "Q: Phone app using too much battery? So let me preface my image by saying I have made ~20 seconds of phone calls in the past 24 hours.  \nAfter heavily browsing the web in 1-2 bars of LTE coverage for a few hours, I looked at my battery usage statistics and saw the following.  What's the deal here? This is iOS 10.1.1 on an iPhone 7 on AT&T.\n \n\nA: You're just interpreting the figures incorrectly.\nThe percentages are not % of the battery used, but % of the usage by each app contributing any usage in the past day or week.  \nNote it always adds up to 100%, no matter how much battery charge you have left, or when you last charged it.\nIt just happens to be, that of all the battery used since yesterday, your phone call used ⅓ of that usage - not ⅓ of a full charge.\nCheck the 7-day figure to see that also always adds up to 100.\nIt would be incredibly difficult to show the stats any other way.  \nImagine... you used an app on a full charge, recharged when it was barely used, used another app for 2 hours, recharged it for 20 mins, then the phone rang, you spent an hour on the phone, then recharged but only halfway, after which you used another app...\n...nothing could keep track of that in any meaningful way.\n", "Q: Mid '11 Mac Mini boot loops at Apple logo, but can boot to Safe Mode So the previous issue I had with my Mac Mini has morphed into a worse one and now it won't even boot normally, it just endlessly boot loops at the Apple screen. However, I have ran Apple Hardware Test twice and it comes back with \"no trouble found.\" I'm really at my wit's end with this issue and am ready to just reinstall OS X entirely (I'm on OS X El Cap 10.11.6), but am not sure that would help...but I think it must be a software issue since I can boot to Safe Mode. Does that sound right? \nSo far I have tried:\n- Turning the Mac Mini over and opening the bottom panel to let heat\n   radiate out better.\n- Disconnecting everything but keyboard/mouse & monitor.\n- Ran AHT several times (always just says \"No trouble found.\"\n- Booted to Apple -R to recovery: recheck disk and ran repair\n   permissions.\n- Pulled both 8GB RAM modules (one at a time, of\n   course) and tried booting with only one.\nI'm out of ideas here. Any feedback here greatly appreciated.  \nEDIT: No idea how or why it's able to run in Safe Mode, but I think this must be a hardware issue because I am not able to boot to either Recovery or a Linux Mint USB. Both also cause a boot loop! \n\nA: Reinstalling from Recovery mode should work. Here is how to enter recovery mode. On a normal working computer, it usually takes a few tries to get into recovery mode as the timing is very important. Maybe try a few times to get into recovery mode. Make sure you go into the regular Recovery Mode and NOT Internet Recovery Mode.\nAnother thing you could try is to see if it is a hardware problem or a software problem. You could check this by creating a bootable usb drive with another OS(it doesn't really matter which OS) and attempting to boot into that OS on your Mac Mini. If booting into another OS works, you'll know it's a software problem.\nIf you have access to another Mac use this guide(by osxdaily) to safely install macOS onto your Mac using a bootable USB drive or use this guide(by apple).\nIf you need a .dmg file for macOS/OS X(to create a bootable USB on non macOS/OS X systems) try this link.\n", "Q: Reset iPhone without iTunes or iCloud? I need to reset an iPhone. My grandmother somehow locked her iPhone with a pin and no one knows the code. I have a backup of her phone in my iTunes but I need to reset the phone before I can restore that backup. \nWhen I attempt to restore the phone it tells me it has a problem downloading the software. I've tried on multiple computers. There isn't an iCloud account for this phone so I cannot reset it using that method. \nHow do I reset the phone so I can restore it and get it working again? \nIt's an iPhone SE running the latest iOS. \n\nA: If, as you say, there is no iCloud account associated with that phone then restoring it using the DFU method should work. (This method applies when iPhone is on and plugged into a Mac with iTunes open)\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the Power and Home buttons on the iPhone until the screen goes black\n\n*Continue holding Power and Home for two seconds after the screen goes black and then release the Power button, while still holding Home\n\n*iTunes will display a message saying it has detected a device in DFU mode (or recovery mode) and will give you an option to restore it. Release the buttons. \nIf you're having issues with the actual download of the IPSW file itself then that'll be either your internet having issues with the download or Apple's software server having issues with delivering it.\n", "Q: How to create multi-field dialog box in AppleScript (to request time from user)? I have an Automator Application that I would like to ask the user to enter a time of the user's choosing.\nIdeally, I would like the dialog box to have three fields:\n1) Hour field\n2) Minutes field\n3) Period (p.m. or a.m.)\nFields one and two are enterable by the user and there is a colon in between the two fields. Field three is a simple drop-down list and the user must select one of the two options.\nI would also like the AppleScript to check that whatever text is typed in the hour and minutes fields comports to the standards of time, and if it does not, then an error message is presented and the user must enter the text again. (I.e., the text entered in the first field must be a single-digit number between 1 and 12 and the text entered in the second field must be a two-digit number between 00 and 60.)\nI know that all of this can be accomplished in three separate dialog boxes, but I really would prefer to have it all completed in one dialog box (for the sake of presenting the user with a convenient UI).\nI am not very proficient in AppleScript, so this project is extremely ambitious for me.

That would be so much easier and save the step of having to record it to the already limited iPad, then transfer it after that to the eternal storage device. \n\nA: No - iOS doesn't have a concept of letting you attach permanently storage. When you have an accessory - you'll have to move things that are easily portable (media, etc...) to the external storage and then delete them from the main storage.\nRecording goes to the boot volume so you need space there to record.\n", "Q: One-sided iCloud photo upload I have a lot of pictures on my iPhone SE.

How can I do this?\n\nA: You can't, is the short answer. iCloud Photo Library is a two-way street - if you want to be able to upload to it, it has to be turned on, which means photos will also be synced to the device.\nYou can enable Optimize Device Storage under Settings > Photos, but that will still use some storage on the device. There is no way to bring that to zero without disabling iCloud Photo Library on the device entirely.\n", "Q: How to install VLC Player on the original iPad (iOS 5.1.1)? My friend has the original iPad that runs iOS 5.1.1 and can't be updated any further. Very few apps these days are compatible with that version of iOS. The new version of VLC in the App Store requires iOS 7.\nWhat I thought I'd do is get an old version of the .ipa for VLC that's compatible with iOS 5.1.1. I have a computer with iTunes that I wonder if I can use to transfer it to the iPad.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are some old versions of VLC compatible with iOS 5.1.1? If yes, what's the latest VLC version that's compatible?\n\n*Where can I get such .ipa files?\n\n*Do I have to jailbreak the iPad in order to install such downloaded files, or can I do it without jailbreaking?\n\n\nA: version 2.2.x is what you need.\nThe latest with 5.1 support according to wiki:\nhttps://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:IOS/#Feature_Overview\nDownload away!

I want to write an AppleScript that \n\n\n*\n\n*runs (in a loop) until I press esc\n\n*\"listens\" for keystrokes 1, 2, etc.\n\n*executes a given command for a each keypress (running a shell command ddcctl to change secondary monitor brightness/contrast)\n\n\nI've searched and everything I find relates to simulating a key press.\n(If this can be done in bash that's fine but I don't know enough shell scripting to even start...)\n\nUPDATE\nBased on this tip, I wrote the shell script below, which works great, but only if I run it within Terminal.

The service should just execute your a bash script similar to this:\n#!/bin/bash\nddcctl -d 1 -b 10\n\nThen in System Preference under Keyboard, add a keyboard shortcut to activate your Service.\nThis way your shortcut will work across all programs.\nYou'll probably need to do this for each of the 10 keyboard shortcuts you need.\n\nA: I have just found an amazing solution.

Compare original RAM specification and the one you installed. For Macs manufacturers usually have specially tested and tuned RAM modules. Anything cheap will actually decrease performance.\nSecondly, Mac allocates as much swap as you have RAM. Earlier your Mac allocated 4GB at start, now it has to allocate 16GB. If you do not have SSD, this will be much slower because the swap file has to be written to disk at start.\n", "Q: Siera on older (unsupported) Macs Two months ago Collin Mistr shared a patch tool for older, low-end Macs to be able to install macOS Sierra (link). Besides the fact that I do this upgrade, since my Mac Mini is late 2009, I wonder are there any benefits. El Capitan looks good on it, with 4GB of RAM etc. Any advice?\n\nA: Officially your Mac is not supported by macOS Sierra. However, for whatever reason, the option to upgrade to macOS Sierra is appearing in the App Store for a whole range of unsupported Macs. In fact, a few weeks back I saw this occur on a MacBook Pro (15\" Late-2008) model that was running Snow Leopard 10.6.8, even though Apple doesn't officially support upgrading from this hardware or OS.\nAs to whether you can install it, the answer is yes, even though this isn't officially supported by Apple. If the App Store allows you to download the upgrade, then you could just download it (without installing it) and then make a copy of the installer. Once you've got a copy you could try installing from the original downloaded location to see what happens. \nIf this doesn't work, the other option as you've already referenced, is to download the macOS Sierra Patcher Tool for Unsupported Macs. Make sure you read all the information on this page as it contains important information you should weigh up before proceeding. If it was me I would not proceed without a full backup ready so you could recover your system if all goes bad.\nIn the end, whether you should download the upgrade is up to you. Do you want macOS Sierra? Many of its new features are not supported even on Macs that are officially supported by the upgrade - so the answer to this will depend on what appeals to you in upgrading to macOS Sierra? To help you decide, go to Upgrade to macOS Sierra and scroll down to the Feature Requirements section.  \nIf what appeals to you isn't likely to work because it's only supported on much newer Mac models, then I wouldn't bother. This is especially so since you've already stated that El Capitan looks good on it.\n", "Q: How to remove adware on macOS Sierra 10.12.1? I recently came across an adware on my Mac.

I really prefer the latter behavior, because otherwise my browser window quickly fills up with search results tabs that I have no use for. I also don't see myself getting used to manually closing every single search result tab I open during the day. \nHence, I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if there's perhaps a way to disable this \"feature\". \n\nA: This not an Apple issue becuase it's a Yahoo preference setting\nWhat you need to do is set your search preferences so that search results open in the current tab.\nOnce you set this, it will be active across all browsers in all platforms.\n\n", "Q: Eclipse STS re creates folders every time it is opened, may be due to file permissions Ok, i have asked this question two times in stackoverflow two times, here and here.\nI haven't gotten an answer, but after rethinking the problem i think it may be because of files / folders permissions, ok this is what it is happening.\nEnvironment: eclipse STS 3.8.2 which run over java 1.8 and the SO is macOs Sierra.\nwhen i open the IDE for first time it creates a folder in my home user called .eclipse and inside a folder with the name org.springsource.sts_3.8.2.RELEASE_562342862_macosx_cocoa_x86_64.

I have tried to copy and paste the content of one folder to another but the IDE ignores the files in there.\n\nA: I was also facing the same issue.

When asked to choose a file, open this .txt file.\n\n*Open the .txt file in TextEdit and manually add one blank line in between the new \"Wassup?\" line and the original \"This is a sentence\" line by using your Enter key.\n\n*Open the .txt file in your hex editor. Notice that this new blank line is 0A0D. It should be, however, 0A0A. So, while the answer provided by Christian Boyce does not change all instances of 0A0A to 0D0D (in the way that the answers provided by Matteo and user3439894 do), it does use 0D instead of 0A when putting \"Wassup?\" on a new line.\nIt took me a long time to discover this glitch, as one could never tell that there was a problem with these AppleScript solutions unless one opens the .txt file in a hex editor.\nThe problem with the answer provided by Mateusz Szlosek is more severe; it replaces all instances of 0A0A with 20, thereby ensuring that there are no blank lines anywhere in the .txt file (which, unlike the other answers, meant that I could easily identify that it had a bug without opening the .txt file in a hex editor).\nSo, I am re-opening this question, now hoping that someone can provide a way to prepend text to a .txt file using AppleScript, and without converting line feeds to carriage returns in the process.\nIf you are curious why I need the line feeds to be preserved, it is because I have a later process that writes to the first blank line of the .txt file, and this process does not work properly if the line feeds are replaced with carriage returns.\n\nA: You could copy the current content of the file to a variable, then copy TextToWrite to TargetFilePath and then append the previous content back to TargetFilePath.\nset x to (do shell script \"cat \" & quoted form of TargetFilePath)\n\ndo shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of TextToWrite & \" > \" & quoted form of TargetFilePath\n\ndo shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of x & \" >> \" & quoted form of TargetFilePath\n\n\nA: Updated Answer:\nThe code below it what I'd use to replace the original code offered as there appears to be a bug in AppleScript when using the do shell script command in the manner originally presented that isn't present went the code, in a representative manner, is run in a bash script in Terminal.\nNote that anytimeopen for access is used, it needs to be coded to trap any errors and try and close the file, which this attempts to do. That said it is not necessarily then only error handling I'd employ and all coding answer I present are done so as proof of concept and the onus to write code employing reasonable error handing is yours to fulfill.\nAs coded, this will create the target file if it doesn't exist while adding the text to add to it and if it does exist, places the text to add as the top line of the target file.\nset targetFilePathname to (POSIX path of (path to desktop as string) & \"My Fruit Log.txt\")\n\n--    # set theTextToWrite to \"This text will be written at the top of the file.\" & \"\\n\"    \nset theTextToWrite to \"This text will be written at the top of the file.\" & \"\\n\"\nset theOriginalText to \"\"\ntry\n    set theOriginalText to (read targetFilePathname) as string\nend try\n--    # set theTextToWrite to theTextToWrite & \"\\n\" & theOriginalText\nset theTextToWrite to theTextToWrite & \"\\n\" & theOriginalText\ntry\n    set referenceNumber to open for access targetFilePathname with write permission\n    write theTextToWrite to referenceNumber starting at 0\n    close access referenceNumber\non error eStr number eNum\n    display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"File I/O Error...\" with icon caution\n    try\n        close access referenceNumber\n    end try\n    return\nend try\n\n\nA: You could do it this way, avoiding the shell scripts. \nset the_file to choose file\nset the_content to read of the_file\n\nset the_new_stuff to \"Wassup?\" & return & the_content\nset the_file_path to the_file as string\nset open_for_writing to open for access file the_file_path with write permission\nwrite the_new_stuff to open_for_writing starting at 0\nclose access open_for_writing\n\nBasically you read the text in the .txt file, you put \"Wassup?\" and a return in front of the text, and then you write over what's in the file (because you start at position 0).\n\nA: Here's an example of the AppleScript You can use:\nset TargetFilepath to \"$HOME/Desktop/file.txt\"\nset TextToWrite to quoted form of \"NewText\\n\"\ndo shell script \"echo \" & TextToWrite & \"$(cat \" & TargetFilepath & \") > \" & TargetFilepath\n\nIt uses the formula: echo \"prepend\\n $(cat input)\" > input\n\nA: After a lot of trial and error, I think I have found one way to prepend text to a .txt file without carriage returns being introduced into the .txt file.\nMy solution is built on the solution provided by @Christian Boyce, with just one small change: replace return with \"\\n\".\nSo, the full solution would be:\nset the_file to choose file\nset the_content to read of the_file\n\nset the_new_stuff to \"Wassup?\" & \"\\n\" & the_content\nset the_file_path to the_file as string\nset open_for_writing to open for access file the_file_path with write permission\nwrite the_new_stuff to open_for_writing starting at 0\nclose access open_for_writing\n\nI have done tests with this code and I have not found it to insert 0D into the document and nor does it change any instances of 0A to 0D.\n", "Q: \"Xcode is not installed on this system.

If someone can reword the title, please do so. I'm in a dire situation where I bought a costly time limited WiFi access on my iPhone.\nI stupidly presumed that the Hotspot the iPhone can produce, would allow my MacBook go online too. Of course that was wrong, as the Hotspot uses mobile data. \nSo I thought I can make my MacBook to look like an iPhone to the network as I received no password and I think no cookies are involved, as I can go online in every browser or app. I've tried to set the MAC address of the values of the iPhone (the WiFi, not the Bluetooth ones) and change the MacBook's name to iPhone (in the file sharing prefs, not sure if I should look somewhere else). \nIs there something more I could do? \n\nA: I could solve it, I used this command to change my MAC address: \nsudo ifconfig en0 ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX \n\nBut it should have been en1 for WiFi :)\nSorry I forgot my login\n", "Q: How can I force MacPorts to upgrade all upgradeable ports that it can? Suppose I have outdated Ports A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Suppose for simplicity that all of them are \"requested\". \n\n\n*\n\n*A has no dependencies. \n\n*B directly depends on C and D and E. \n\n*C directly depends on E and F. \n\n*D has no dependencies. \n\n*E has no dependencies. \n\n*F has no dependencies. \n\n*G has no dependencies. \n\n\nTo the best of my understanding, when MacPorts runs (sudo port upgrade outdated), it installs the ports in a dependency tree sorted by alphabetical order. So, it would install the ports in this order: A, D, E, F, C, B. \nSuppose Port A is broken. MacPorts quits installing. \nI see this as an inconvenience, because the other outdated ports could very well be working fine. The fact that A won't install has no effect on any of the other ports. Now, because a single port won't install, all the rest of my ports are out-of-date until this port is fixed. \nMy Question:\nHow can I tell MacPorts to continue installing all installable ports that it can install without error? \nThis is probably the same as this one in spirit: MacPorts: Continue installing other updates after error. I don't buy the answers on that page, however: \n\n\n*\n\n*The MacPorts dev (@ClemensLang) says that there's a reason MacPorts doesn't continue. (The links he includes support this, but it gets too technical for me. Sorry!) In my case above, installing Port G after Port A fails wouldn't seem to be problematic. (...or is it?) Is there a way to do it safely? \n\n*The -p flag is evidently problematic. I would have thought that would be the answer to this solution, but multiple devs caution users not to use it unless they really understand what it does. I'd rather play it safe. \n\n*I could try sudo port upgrade outdated and not A. This works if only one independent port fails, but what if I have two or three ports (out of dozens) that fail? Could I do something like, sudo port upgrade outdated and not A and not C and not E (etc.)? \n\n\nSuppose there are too many ports that fail to exclude them individually. Suppose also that there are too many ports to upgrade them individually. \n\nA: This is what I use... it might not be pretty but it works:\nsudo bash -c 'for port in `port outdated  2>/dev/null |  tail -n +2 | awk '\\''{print $1}'\\''` ; do echo -n \"$port:\" ;  port -N upgrade $port 2>> /tmp/upgrade-ports.err >> /tmp/upgrade-ports.out && echo \"✓\" || echo \"✕\" ; done'\n\nLet me brake it down for you:\n\n*\n\n*first, you don't want sudo in a loop, otherwise you need to keep putting your password. To avoid sudo I got the whole loop and quoted it (Alt+' in zsh is very helpful to properly escape the existing quotes) and then ran it with sudo bash -c. Alternatively you can put it in a file and run it as a script with sudo script\n\n\n*that leaves us with this loop:\nfor port in `port outdated  2>/dev/null | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $1}'` ; do echo -n \"$port:\" ;  port -N upgrade $port 2>> /tmp/upgrade-ports.err >> /tmp/upgrade-ports.out && echo \"✓\" || echo \"✕\" ; done```\n\n\n*\n\n*I build the list of ports with:\nport outdated  2>/dev/null | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $1}' (tail removes the line \"The following installed ports are outdated:\")\n\n*for every port I print the port name and a semicolon (without newline )\n\n*then I try to upgrade it non interactively, and save the output and errors\n\n*if the upgrade was successful I print a \"✓\" and a newline, otherwise a \"✕\" and a newline\n\n*note that this will not show the dependencies being installed, but you can tail the log to see what is happening*\n\n*this is what the output looks like:\n\nadwaita-icon-theme:✓\napr:✕\naquaterm:✓\n\nHTH\n*Edited to clarify.\nThis means that in your example the output would look like this:\nA:✕\nB:✓\nC:✓\nD:✓\nE:✓\nF:✓\nG:✓\n\nBut B will take a LONG time, and C, D, E and F will be very fast because they have already been upgraded during B.\n", "Q: Can't Authenticate my work gMail — I get right through the OTP dance then it simply fails I've updated my iMac to Sierra (which is a red-herring, see further update below) and since then reset my work password, so need to re-authenticate via System Prefs > Internet Accounts.

I have a .txt file saved on my computer. I want my Automator application to add a bit of text to the .txt file (the text will be entered by the user). I already know how to append text or prepend text in AppleScript. However, I want the text to be inserted into a specific location.\nFor example, this is the contents of my .txt file entitled My Fruit Log.txt. This is what the .txt file looks like before the text is written to the file:\n\nYou can see where exactly I want the text to be saved in the file in this image:\n\nIs what I want to do clear? I want the text to be written on the line directly above the first blank line found in the file. Note: It is not necessarily the second line from the top where I want the text to be written. Depending on what text has already been written to the file, the text might be saved on a lower line. For example:\n\nThe location where I want the text to be written must be at least the second line from the top, but it may also be as further down as the seventh line from the top. So, the most reliable way to articulate where I want to write the text is \"on the line before the first instance of a blank line in the document.\"\nCan this be accomplished in AppleScript?\n\nA: Here's a shell script:\nsed -i '' -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's/\\n\\n/\\\nWrite the new line you wish inserted in your file here\\\n\\\n/' ~/Desktop/file.txt\n\nYou can wrap this in a ‘do shell script’ if you really want AppleScript, but for an Automator script, you can use a Run Shell Script action and just use the shell script.\n\nHere's an AppleScript wrapper for the script, where the TextToWrite variable and the Target_Filepath variable have been defined elsewhere per your comments:\nset addline to \"sed -i '' -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's/\\\\n\\\\n/\\\\\n\" & TextToWrite & \"\\\\\n\\\\\n/' \\\"\" & Target_Filepath & \"\\\"\"\ndo shell script addline\n\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you what to write some new text content to the text file directly above the first blank line and if that's correct then here's an example of one way it can be done.\nNote that sometimes the AppleScript do shell script command can get complex when having to escape certain instances of special charters, ordinary charters and or if multiple command lines are involved, etc.\nSo in the following example I'm going to limit the do shell script command to something as simple as I can that doesn't require lots of escaping while allowing for a variable filename and will return the byte count up to the first blank line in the file, as I believe this is the insertion point you're requesting for where the new text is to be written.\nI will then use the byte count as the offset point as the reference point to where the new text would be written to the target text file. I'll do this by reading into variables from the start of the file up the offset and reading from the offset to the end of the file, then concatenate the three variables to one variable to write to the target file from the beginning of the file. Thus overwriting the old content with the combination of new and old content.\n\nAppleScript code:\nset filePathName to POSIX path of (path to desktop as string) & \"My Fruit Log.txt\"\n\ntry\n    set offsetCount to (do shell script \"grep -b -m1 '^$' \\\"\" & filePathName & \"\\\" | cut -f1 -d:\")\nend try\nif offsetCount is equal to \"0\" or offsetCount is equal to \"\" then\n    display dialog \"The contents of the target file does not conform to the necessary requirements for processing and or may contain consecutive 0D Carriage Return Characters, instead of the 0A Line Feed Characters expected by default in macOS.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n    return\nend if\n\nset newContent to \"I ate a strawberry at 1 am.\"\n\ntry\n    set referenceNumber to open for access filePathName with write permission\n\n    set oldContentUpToFirstBlankLine to read referenceNumber from 1 to offsetCount\n    set oldContentFromFirstBlankLine to read referenceNumber from offsetCount to eof\n\n    set allContent to oldContentUpToFirstBlankLine & newContent & oldContentFromFirstBlankLine\n\n    write allContent to referenceNumber starting at 0\n    close access referenceNumber\n\non error eStr number eNum\n    display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"File I/O Error...\" with icon caution\n    try\n        close access referenceNumber\n    end try\n    return\nend try\n\n\nTerminal output of \"My Fruit Log.txt\" before running AppleScript code:\n$ cat \"$HOME/Desktop/My Fruit Log.txt\"\n2016_11_09 -\n\n2016_11_08 -\nI ate a banana at 8 am.\nI ate a kiwi at 11 am.\nI ate a mango at 6 pm.\n\n2016_11_07 -\nI ate a pear at 6 am.\nI ate a tangerine at 4 pm.\nI ate a peach at 8 pm.\n$ \n\nTerminal output of \"My Fruit Log.txt\" after running AppleScript code:\n$ cat \"$HOME/Desktop/My Fruit Log.txt\"\n2016_11_09 -\nI ate a strawberry at 1 am.\n\n2016_11_08 -\nI ate a banana at 8 am.\nI ate a kiwi at 11 am.\nI ate a mango at 6 pm.\n\n2016_11_07 -\nI ate a pear at 6 am.\nI ate a tangerine at 4 pm.\nI ate a peach at 8 pm.\n$ \n\n\nSo as you can see, this inserts the new text content above the first blank line in the file.\nBelow we see the Event Log of the AppleScript Editor when the above AppleScrip code is run:\ntell current application\n    path to desktop as string\n        --> \"Macintosh HD:Users:me:Desktop:\"\n    do shell script \"grep -b -m1 '^$' \\\"/Users/me/Desktop/My Fruit Log.txt\\\" | cut -f1 -d:\"\n        --> \"13\"\n    open for access \"/Users/me/Desktop/My Fruit Log.txt\" with write permission\n        --> 172\n    read 172 from 1 to \"13\"\n        --> \"2016_11_09 -\n\"\n    read 172 from \"13\" to eof\n        --> \"\n\n2016_11_08 -\nI ate a banana at 8 am.\nI ate a kiwi at 11 am.\nI ate a mango at 6 pm.\n\n2016_11_07 -\nI ate a pear at 6 am.\nI ate a tangerine at 4 pm.\nI ate a peach at 8 pm.\n\"\n    write \"2016_11_09 -\nI ate a strawberry at 1 am.\n\n2016_11_08 -\nI ate a banana at 8 am.\nI ate a kiwi at 11 am.\nI ate a mango at 6 pm.\n\n2016_11_07 -\nI ate a pear at 6 am.\nI ate a tangerine at 4 pm.\nI ate a peach at 8 pm.\n\" to 172 starting at 0\n    close access 172\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Send Barcode Scan to URL I have a Bluetooth barcode scanner connected to my Mac.

You can even program in the Return keypress to go to the website automatically. It may have to be done in with some AppleScripting, depending on the complexity.\nYou could set it up so it sends a CtrlB, wait to allow your browser to loaunch and then and the text http://example.com/?xxxxxxxxxx \n", "Q: How to drag files into an app's Dock icon in macOS Sierra? Up until the macOS Sierra update, I was able to do the following, which I used quite a lot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start writing an email in Outlook for Mac or in Mail.app.\n\n*Select a file in Finder that I want to attach to the email.\n\n*Drag the file to Mail.app (or Outlook) Dock icon.\n\n*Hover over the Dock icon until the icon flashes a couple of times and then shows the open application windows.

I could ping My-MacBook-Pro but not My-MacBook-Pro.local.\nI resolved it by going to System Preferences -> Sharing and turning on one of the services (Printer Sharing, File Sharing etc). Once I had done that I could ping My-MacBook-Pro.local and Chrome started responding properly.\n\nA: We had the issue due to having 4-5 old old DNS servers manually entered in the mac's network settings. The machine was trying to contact each of these and timing out. Once we cleaned up DNS the problem went away. \n", "Q: Safari Web Inspector stops logging network activity I'm using Safari 10.0.1 on Sierra 10.12.1.\nAt some point, usually after ~5 minutes or about 100 requests, the web inspector stops logging network requests under the Network tab.\nSame thing happens with the Timelines tab. \nI've had this problem since Safari 9 on El Cap. \nAny pointers on how to solve this?\n\nA: This sounds like a bug.

Ive got a mac mini running osx 10.8.5. To get images from my iphone onto the computer i used to use osx's built in Image Capture application to transfer them across as it allows me to drag and drop file them where ever i want and is light weight and quick (unlike iPhoto / Photos in new versions of the OS).\nIve recently updated my iphone to a iPhone 6s running iOS 10.x (latest). Now when i plug the iphone into the mac mini and launch image capture it says the phone needs to be unlocked, so i input the passcode into the phone, but nothing happens in image capture and im not able to download the images. \nDoes any one know if this is an incompatibility issue between iOS 10 and OSX 10.8.5 or is something else ? \n\nJust in case any one asks : Why havn't you updated from OSX 10.8.5.. Because if it ain't broke don't fix it. Its a machine used for work and its still super snappy, although if it needs updating to work with iOS 10 i will have to do it, i just don't want to do it un necessarily. \n\nA: I saw a couple of other posts on this issue where they suggested deleting the plist files for image capture, i tried this but to no avail. \nIn the end i upgraded from 10.8.5 to 10.10.5 and it seems to have solved the issue. Not sure if its a incompatibility issue between 10.8.5 and iOS10 or rather that image capture was corrupt and upgrading OSX fixed that, but either way issue was resolved. \n", "Q: Have I killed it I dropped my poor iPod again it is a generation 4 64gb, I use it for listening to audio books.

Siri will only work if you are connected to the internet. Dictation commands (enhanced dictation) works with or without an internet connection.  Siri's capabilities are quite limited. The beauty of enabling and using enhanced dictation commands, is that you can create your own dictation commands. Getting used to the whole process takes a little trial and error. I barely ever use my mouse anymore.  I've created so many new dictation commands that I can virtually use dictation commands for entering passwords into password fields, create and send iMessages, emails, opening and closing applications, etc.\nIn fact, this entire answer I am posting was done with dictation commands. If you really want to roll your sleeves up and dive in, you can create AppleScripts that can be very complex then the save that as an application and enable that application as a spoken dictation command.  \nFor example, I wrote an AppleScript that takes screenshots of my computer screen if the motion sensor on my built in iSight camera gets triggered.\nThe screenshots are stored on my desktop and then automatically messaged to me through iMessages. Then once the message has been sent, the snapshot gets deleted from my desktop automatically and stored in my dropbox. Long story short, with dictation commands, all I need to say is \"Run Surveillance\" which activates the video software with the motion detection, and from there the scripts get triggered.  \nHere is a quick snippet of the iMessage part of the script.\nset exportAs to \"Screengrab.png\"\nset myScreengrab to POSIX file \"/Users/Smokestack/Desktop/iSentry_Motion_Detector/Screengrab.png\"\ndo shell script \"screencapture -mx -T0 \" & quoted form of POSIX path of myScreengrab\ntell application \"Messages\"\n    activate\n    set targetBuddy to \"blah@icloud.com\"\n    set targetService to id of 1st service whose service type = iMessage\n    set textMessage to myScreengrab\n    set theBuddy to buddy targetBuddy of service id targetService\n    send textMessage to theBuddy\n    delay 5\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"h\" using (command down)\n    end tell\nend tell\ntell application \"iSentry\"\n    activate\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    delete myScreengrab\nend tell\n\nReally there is no limit to how much of your computer you can control with dictation commands as long as you are willing to do some research and a whole lot of reading and trial and error.\n\nA: To use normal dictation, focus an input field and press fn twice (default shortcut).\nFor more dictation settings, see System Preferences → Keyboard → Dictation.\n\nA: You can find a guide here\nhttp://briansbits.com/mac_siri.php\nAnd the current version of a Siri listener script here\nhttp://briansbits.com/starbase/SiriListener2.scpt\nYou have to modify the script so in writes to your input field.\n", "Q: How to force the opening of UNetBootin?

Just select the pictures, right-click them, select Share > AirDrop, and pick your iPhone. Make sure it's unlocked, or it won't show up.\nImportant note: To use AirDrop between Mac and iOS, your mac needs to be from 2012 or later (but not the mid-2012 Mac Pro) and running OS X Yosemite (10.10) or later, and your iPhone needs iOS 7 or later.\n\nA: *\n\n*Quit iTunes.\n\n*Under Terminal.app:\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunes DeviceBackupsDisabled -bool true\n\n\n*If you ever want to reenable the backups:\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunes DeviceBackupsDisabled -bool false\n\nTested on iTunes 12.9.0 / Photos 4.0 / MacOS 10.14.1.\nSource\n\nA: You may get tired of using iTunes to transfer photos from computer to iPhone.

The computer will continue to power RAM in sleep mode, so that whatever was in RAM when the computer went to sleep will still be there when the computer wakes. This also means that computers with more RAM use slightly more power in sleep mode.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT201714\nHibernation is called Safe Sleep in macOS. This is where the contents of the RAM is saved to disk.\n\nOS X includes a deep sleep mode known as safe sleep. Your Mac may enter safe sleep if your battery begins to run low, or your computer is left idle for a long time. Safe sleep copies the contents of memory to your startup drive, and powers down the computer. This helps you when your battery is depleted on Mac notebooks. All you have to do is connect your notebook to AC power again to pick up where you left off, without losing your work.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT202824\n\nSafe Sleep ensures that data stored in the main memory of your Mac isn't lost when the computer shuts down due to its battery being drained completely. \nBefore your Mac enters sleep, Safe Sleep automatically saves the contents of its main memory — like desktop settings, open applications, and other work in progress — to the hard drive.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT201635\nIdle sleep is not a sleep mode, but rather a description of how Sleep can be activated: through the machine being idle for a set period.\n\nWhen you leave your computer idle, OS X automatically turns off or powers down features that you aren't using. When the computer needs to perform a task, related components are powered back up.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT202824\nStandby mode is similar to Safe Sleep but used when your machine has an SSD.\n\nFor Mac computers that are started from an solid-state drive, OS X includes a deep sleep mode known as Standby Mode. Mac computers manufactured in 2013 or later enter standby after one to three hours of regular sleep. A computer with a fully charged battery can remain in standby for up to thirty days without being plugged in to an AC power source.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT202824\n\nMac notebook and desktop computers have a power standby feature that conserves energy. During standby, the state of your session is saved to flash storage (SSD). Then, the power turns off to some hardware systems such as RAM and USB buses.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT202124\npmset's autopoweroff sets the time it takes from Sleep starting until Safe Sleep is initiated.\n\nautopoweroff - Where supported, enabled per default as an implementation of Lot 6 to the European Energy-related Products Directive. After sleeping for <autopoweroffdelay> minutes, the system will write a hibernation image and go into a lower power chipset sleep. Wakeups from this state will take longer than wakeups from regular sleep. The system will not auto power off if any external devices are connected, if the system is on battery power, or if the system is bound to a network and wake for network access is enabled.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html\n", "Q: Links in Gmail won't open in Chrome iPhone 7\niOS 10.1.1\nGmail 5.0.3\nChrome 54.0.2840.91  \nWhen trying to open a link directly within the gmail app, it opens in safari instead of chrome.

Then you can pair to your new MacBook.\nFrom the Apple Support site\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your device is powered on.\n\n\n*If the LED is blinking, your device is in Discoverable Mode. If the LED is steady, your device is paired with another item. Unpair the device, turn it off, and start again.\n\n\n*In the menu bar of your Mac, choose the Bluetooth icon, then\nchoose Open Bluetooth Preferences.\n\n\n*Your Mac scans for available Bluetooth devices.\n\n\n*When your device appears in the Bluetooth Preference Pane, click Pair.\n\nIn fact, you don't have to unpair it per se - so long as the old MBA isn't in range (off,  works) you should be able to pair it with no problems.\n", "Q: Enable Multilingual typing in ios10 Some days ago the \"Multilingual typing\" option (which enables to type in two languages at the same time without having to switch between keyboards) in my iPhone 5S (with iOS 10) automatically shut down. \nI already downloaded multiple dictionaries and enabled the respective keybords under the General menu.\n\n\nDoes someone know how to enable it again?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> Dictionary.\n\n*Select the languages you wish to use with the QuickType keyboard (allow it time to download).\n\n*Return to the General -> Keyboards.

This application is not listed in my apps, nor does it ship with an uninstaller I can locate. The support site says to contact their support team, but the product is not listed in the drop down for support requests.\nHere's what I tried so far in order to get it to stop running, so I could safely delete the program from disk, but it didn't help:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ps aux | grep -i endpoint\n\n*sudo launchctl list | grep -i bitdefender\n\n*for each bitdefender product listed: sudo launchctl remove \n\n*reboot\n\n\nThe application ran again after reboot.\n\nA: I might be a bit late on this one, but the uninstall script is one of\n/Library/Bitdefender/AVP/Uninstaller/BitdefenderforMacUninstaller.app\n/Library/Bitdefender/AVP/Uninstaller/EndpointSecurityforMacUninstaller.app\n\nThere should be a shortcut in the applications folder too.\n\nA: Note that if you have multiple Bitdefender products installed and you only want to remove one of them, this is not the right approach.\n\n\n*\n\n*finder go to /Library/StartupItems, then delete Bitdefender folder\n\n*finder go to /Library/LaunchDaemons, then delete com.bitdefender.* items\n\n*finder go to /Library/LaunchAgents, then delete com.bitdefender.* items\n\n*sudo ps aux | grep -i endpoint, note process pid\n\n*sudo kill -9 \n\n*reboot\n\n\nThe program no longer launches after reboot.

Any suggestions?\n\nA: The sound control in Control Centre gives either the currently playing source of sound or the most recent source of sound. I'm assuming Gas Buddy had some kind of background sound going on. If you start to play music through the Music app, Control Centre should list Music as the app. \n", "Q: Chrome find bar closing on macOS Sierra Previously on Chrome, I could use ⌘+F to bring up the Chrome find bar, then esc would close it. However, on macOS Sierra, esc now exits full-screen mode if the Chrome window is in this mode (which I commonly use).\nWhat is the shortcut to close the find bar? Alternatively, how do I disable esc closing full-screen mode?\n\nA: A simple workaround to close the find bar is to use Fn + Esc, rather then Esc.\n\nHowever, you can easily prevent Chrome to close the full-sceen mode by pressing Esc through this script (following this post):\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name           Keep Full Screen\n// @namespace     https://superuser.com/q/315949\n// @description    Prevents Escape key from leaving full screen.\n// @include      http://*\n// ==/UserScript==\ndocument.onkeydown = function (evt) {\n    if (evt.keyCode == 27) evt.preventDefault();\n}\n\nTo run this, you can use the NinjaKit Google Chrome extension.\n", "Q: Is it possible to access past iOS logs?

As I understand it DMG only works on macs though (with no additional specialized software installed).\nReadmes are usually ignored by most people, if they didn't read it, they don't have to accept the agreement. That's why I'm looking for a more in-your-face solution for confidential files, say, I was an attorney or lawyer (I am not), I would not want a terms of use to be contested just because it was easy to miss. I want to be able to be able to use a compressible archive. Encryption is desirable, but not always with a pass code.

I need gcc as a default compiler to compile cuda samples and I need clang to compile my network projects because clang has  better warnings and errors specifications.\nIs there any way to run both compilers?\n\nA: Yes you can.\nApple's Xcode supplies clang (and puts in /usr/bin/gcc a link to clang not gcc)\nThen you can then install gcc - probably the easiest way is via a package manager like Macports, Homebrew or Fink\n", "Q: Prevent iPhone from dialing 911 I have a family member who has dementia. Their iPhone was taken away because they kept dialing 911. I gave the family member an iPod Touch, but they really want an iPhone. I took the SIM card out of the iPhone, but discovered that it is still possible to call 911. \nIs there a way to disable the 911 dialing functionality of the iPhone in the United States?\n\nA: No, you cannot disable it for an US iPhone as US law requires that all cell phones be able to call 911 even if no SIM-card is inserted.\nYou would need to obtain a foreign iPhone. For example in the EU the emergency services are typically not dialed with 911 but rather 112.\n", "Q: Do sideloaded iOS apps get permissions without asking? Apple allows anyone with the source code of an app to sideload it onto their iOS device using Xcode.\nIf I sideload an app onto my iOS device, will it have access to information that a normal app would ask for(ex:location, contacts, photos)? Will it still ask for permission to use my data?\n\nA: Yes, it will still ask for permission. Just as if you had downloaded it from the store, it will fail to access your camera, contacts, notifications unless you grant permission.\nThis is important for developers, because it helps ensure that they catch any bugs where they don't ask when they are testing on their devices.  Apps loaded from Xcode follow the same rules in this regard as apps from the App Store.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for service only works after I manually run the service After I assign a keyboard shortcut to initiate a service in System Preferences, I press the keyboard shortcut and nothing happens. I have to first click on the service title under the services menu (found if you click on the application title in the top left corner of the screen). Only then will the keyboard shortcut function correctly.\nIf I quit that application, I have to manually click on the service title under the services menu each and every time I re-open the application. I would've thought that the fix would \"last\" until the computer is shut down or restarted, but nope, it lasts only until the application is quit out of.\nIt may sound as though I am making a mountain out of a molehill, but this extra step essentially defeats the purpose of the keyboard shortcut in the first place, especially since I usually do not know and cannot keep track of if I have already manually run the service since the last time that I opened that application.\nI have to repeat these steps for every application, including stock applications like Finder. Otherwise, the shortcut will not work while I am in that application.\nThis happens for every service I created.\nThis happens regardless of the keyboard shortcut.\nIs there any way to have the keyboard shortcut trigger the service without having to manually run the service first?\n\nMy computer runs OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. It should be noted, however, that I first observed this bug from the very first time that I assigned a keyboard shortcut to my service, which was at least a year ago. In other words, I have never experienced the keyboard shortcut function as it was designed to work.\n\nIt should be noted that this bug is not unique to my computer; reports of others experiencing this idiosyncrasy abound on the internet...\nService not running the first time it's invoked via key combination\nServices shortcut not working properly\nAssigning a shortcut to a service\nAssign a shortcut to running a script in OS X (read the last paragraph in this answer)\n\nA: In my case, I had to change the shortcut from ctrl-option-cmd-L to shift-option-cmd-L before the shortcut would trigger.\nIf adding cmd to the shortcut doesn't work, try substituting a different modifier key for the ctrl.\n\nA: Found the answer in this Apple Support Community thread:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bug: Keyboard shortcut keys do not always activate a service (a workflow)\nKeyboard shortcuts for services will only work properly if they have a ⌘ command key in them.  That is, cmd-ctrl-k works, but ctrl-k needs help.  The \"help\" is to go to the app's menu bar and hover over the services so it sees them. That works until you quit the app.\nBut, if the shortcut contains the ⌘ command key, it works as expected.\n\nA: I have come up with this workaround: Use\nSystem Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts\n\nThere you have to spell out the name of your service.

I was wondering if my iPhoto photos on my laptop will be wiped as well? I use Time Machine, so will that help me recover them?\n\nA: If you've been using Time Machine to backup your MacBook Pro to an external hard drive then yes, your photos will be backed up as long as you haven't specifically excluded them from being backed up.\nTo check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Time Machine\n\n*Click on the Options button at bottom right\n\n*In the window that appears, make sure that your iPhoto Library is not listed and therefore excluded from your backups\n\n\nAs long as it's not listed, you'll be fine.\nAnother thing you can do is to also manually backup your iPhoto Library.

Whenever I try to partition the SSD from within Disk Utility of my bootable USB (or format it via Erase), the process gets stuck and reports either the same error as here or gets stuck at 50% as described here.\nI tried the approaches of the replies in those posts. I created a bootable ubuntu USB and used gparted to format the SSD to gpt first and then to fat32, HSF+, Ext3 hoping that it would allow me to erase the SSD back in Disk Utility. None of these worked out. (Formatting with gparted works, but erasing with Disk Utility afterwards still doesn't)\nGparted from within ubuntu reports The primary GPT table is corrupt, but the backup appears OK, so that will be used and I remember I tried to fix it via Terminal. The same error still pops up whenever I start gparted so I guess I failed.\nWhen I use gpt from within the El Capitan USB it shows me unable to open device '/dev/disk0': I/O error.\nTrying to partition the disk via command line (diskutil partitionDisk ... ) also gets stuck at 50% as described above.\nThese are only a few approaches I've tried and which I can remember. I've been googling for quite some time now and don't really know what else to try. I also don't know if this is a problem with my MBP/OS X or the SSD and if I just should return it and get another one. Sometimes when I reboot it happens that the SSD is not displayed/found when using Disk Utility.\nI would really appreciate any help on this.\nNote: formatting on Ubuntu via gparted works, but erasing the disk back on Disk Utility still doesn't work.\n\nA: in order to install ElCapitan, you have to format to GUID Partition Table, and Mac OS Extended (journaled), nothing else.\n", "Q: System Integrity Protection prevents Trash from being emptied I have no idea how two files ended up in Trash, but I suspect AppDelete to be the culprit.

I do not wish to interfere with the existing Apple LLVM which I would keep available as the default clang, clang++, c++ et c. invocations. So where would the logical place to put these multiple versions be?\nI could place it in something like ~/llvm/svn/ but placing them under ~/ seems mildly unaesthetic.\n\nA: There is no real standard.\nYour choice of your home directory is easiest for compiling them. The only comment here is why the svn part of the directory I would just use ~/llvm. \nIf you are the only user that the home directory makes sense however if your system is multi-user then they could be placed in /usr/local/llvm. As Unix is multi user and I suspect before OSX very few machines had one user the Unix standard is /usr/local and even now systems administrators and distributions have to assume multi user uise.\nI would also consider using package managers like Macports or Homebrew. From reading Macports mailing lists compiling and using llvm is not just a simple compile and the porters wioll have worked out the issues or can work with you to fix problems.\n", "Q: What if the wifi server has \"Security Recommendation\" next to it and it will not connect to internet? Is there a work around or setting change that will help if the wifi server has \"Security Recommendation\" next to it and my iphone 6 will not connect to internet?\n\nA: The 'security recommendation' will display whenever your iPhone sees an unsecured wireless network (meaning you don't need a password to join).  It has nothing to do with your ability to connect to the internet.  That message is just to let you know that anything sent over that wifi connection will be visible/unencrypted.\nIf the owner of that wifi connection, let's say a school, for example, doesn't allow that connection to access the internet, then you won't be able to access the internet.  It's as simple as that and there's no workaround or shortcut to allow you access.  \nIf the connection does allow internet access and you still can't get on the internet, there could be a problem with your iPhone or with that connection.\n", "Q: is the keyboard layout for all macbook pro the same?
