It is a known fact that frequent hibernation could slow down a Windows OS due to memory dumps and I have also experienced it myself. Will this be the same in Ubuntu?\nI am currently using Ubuntu Precise Pangolin (12.04) and I require a complex set-up for my desktop and plan to routinely hibernate instead of shutting down. The steps to enable hibernation are given in this post: How to enable hibernation?, but what I need to know is whether it is safe to do it routinely.\n\nA: \nIt is a known fact that frequent hibernation could slow down a Windows OS due to memory dumps and I have also experienced it myself. Will this be the same in Ubuntu?\n\nJust from personal experience: no. But it should also not do this on Windows. Hibernation by itself should not have any impact on a system since hibernation is only a concern during boots and shutdowns. It basically dumps your machine state to disk during shutdown and loads it back into memory on boot.\nA couple of things though: hibernation often does not work out of the box and that is why it is disabled on Ubuntu by default (Suspend works better and was chosen as the default option). It really depends on your hardware, and if it is not compatible it is impossible to get working.\nBut when it does work it does the job and it will not slow down your system. A hibernation file needs space on a system so a system that is near full does get a performance hit but that is not really a problem with hibernation. A system that needs to swap to get things done will perform less than optimal. That is the same for Linux and Windows but probably more so for a fragmented disk and in the past Linux has had less issues with fragmentation (not sure how Windows is doing in that regard nowadays).\n\nA: Hibernation is disabled by default because it is known to cause problems; if you want to test it, run in a terminal sudo pm-hibernate.\nYour system will instantly shut down. Turn system back on, and if open programs reappear, hibernate works properly.

The VFS is an abstraction layer that gives applications access to different types of file systems and local and network storage devices. According to here both the generic filesystem code (VFS) and the code for each different filesystem are found in /fs directory.2. So using SystemTap you can probe kernel.function(\"*@fs/*.c\").call and kernel.function(\"*@fs/*.c\").return for incoming interactions and kernel.function(\"*@fs/*.c\").inline for outcomming interactions (if you ignore functions that there are in *.c itself).  \n", "Q: Screen goes black when playing games I'm having some problems recently when i play dota.\nAll is running fine for ~2hrs and than suddenly the screen goes blank, although i can hear sounds and that the system is running.

So I'll have to upgrade for real to 15.04 or wait for LTS and bare with this ugly problem.\n\nA: Updating the kernel to 4.3.3 fixes this issue.\n", "Q: What is so dangerous about --trim-sector-ranges? I have an SSD that I want to TRIM before installing Ubuntu on it. It has been suggested to me, that I leave some unpartitioned space, such that the wear leveling will have free blocks to work with. However I understand that because the drive has previously had some software installed, just repartitioning it with some space left unpartitioned is insufficient. And mkfs won't TRIM the unpartitioned area.\nIn reading the hdparm man page, I came across --trim-sector-ranges, which sounds exactly what I need to use. It also has a warning which says: EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS. DO  NOT USE THIS OPTION!! twice.\nI have seen a recomendation suggesting to use the ATA secure erase command instead. But I also read that secure erase has the risk of bricking the device.\nWhat is it that --trim-sector-ranges does that makes it so dangerous that it is better to run the risk of bricking the device?\n\nA: Trimming sectors basically says to the SSD that the sectors do no longer contain useful data, and can be garbage collected (i.e. erased) so that they can be re-used for future write operations. This can improve write performance when the disk is getting full, since the firmware translation layer of the SSD controller has more \"leeway\" to play with physical blocks/pages.\nIn hdparm, sectors to be trimmed are provided as LBA (logical blocks). If your SSD has been formatted with a filesystem, trimming LBA will certainly corrupt the filesystem and make it unusable (since a user has no knowledge of the underlying filesystem-to-LBA mapping). For SSD formatted with a filesystem, trimming should be done at a higher level, with tools such as fstrim.\nWhen supported, the \"ATA secure erase\" command should erase all the physical blocks of the SSD. It could be roughly equivalent to trimming all the sectors of the SSD, but probably in a more optimized and secure way.\nThe referenced link indicates that the \"secure erase\" command failed when used with an USB-to-SATA adapter. This could be due to a poor or buggy implementation of the USB-to-SATA controller, or an implementation which does not comply with recent SATA specifications.\nTo wipeout the contents of a SSD, the SATA secure erase command is the preferred way to go. The --trim-sector-ranges option of a hdparm is for experimental and benchmark purpose. Only for very specific applications (some database systems) that addresses SSD at the LBA level can trimming sectors with hdparm make sense.\nTo finish, the recommendation of leaving some unpartioned space (called over-provisioning) for wear-levelling is interesting, provided this space has been trimmed in some way before (an \"ATA secure erase\" will also do for this purpose). If it's not the case, and if previous data were to exist in the LBA range of the unpartioned space, the SSD controller will assume it is still valid data and strive to keep it \"alive\", by possibly moving the associated blocks and pages (thus increasing overall wear!)\n", "Q: Attempting to install overgrive but getting dpkg/python error I am attempting to install overgrive on a ubuntu 15.04 machine but consistently get the error below.

It either breaks entirely after having installed e.g. the Python package requests, or as in your case, fails to install a specific Python package.\nTo fix this problem and be able to install overgrive, you just have to upgrade your currently installed pip with the PyPI version, not through apt-get from the repositories. To do so, just perform the following command:\nsudo -H pip install --upgrade pip\n\nThe command above installs pip 7.1.2 (or newer) from PyPI to your system. The old 1.5.6 version of pip from the repository will still be available, but when you just type pip into the terminal without an absolute path, the version installed through pip itself will always be preferred. You should not uninstall the repository version of pip using apt-get though, because that might lead to dependency problems. Just leave and ignore it.\nTo update pip3, which is pip for Python 3, you would use the following command instead:\nsudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip\n\nIf pip is broken and fails to install anything, you may temporarily use easy_install instead to get the latest version which usually fixes the problem. The commands for Python 2 and 3 respectively would be:\nsudo -H easy_install --upgrade pip\nsudo -H easy_install3 --upgrade pip\n\n\nA: I'd advise you forget overGrive. I've had my own problems, not only with the program itself, but with the programmer/company owner. He cursed me out for a simple inquiry about registration and has remained unresponsive. At this point, I'd suggest just using the Google Drive web site until/unless Google starts supporting Linux.

But if I run python in the terminal, it always uses the original installation, rather than Anaconda's version. Why is this?\n\nA: In order to optimise command lookup, bash keeps a cache, per bash process, of where it found files. So if you typed python and it found it in /usr/bin/, then changing the PATH to provide another python earlier in the PATH will have no effect. You need to also give the bash command:\nhash -r\n\nto forget the optimised cached.  See help hash.

The title is pretty obvious and common: the error below happens very often.\n\nWhat I am asking is why does it happen. I mean, look at the output of GParted (the first 4 partition are required by Windows)\n\nIt seems very obvious that I have a lot of free space on all the partitions. So, why the system says that the remaining space is so low?  \n\nA: The space that is showing as \"unused\" is not necessarily available to the user.\nSpecifically, filesystems from the ext family reserve a number of disk blocks for system tasks as described here: \n\n\n*\n\n*ext2/3/4 reserved blocks percentage purpose \n\n*Reserved space for\nroot on a filesystem - why?\nThe default amount of reserved space for these filesystems is 5%.\nFrom your screenshots we can see that your root filesystem is located on a partition of size 48.83GiB, so we would expect 48.83 x .05 = 2.44GiB reserved. The unused space is shown as 3.13GiB so that the available space should then be 3.13 - 2.44 = 0.69GiB - close to the 722.6MB shown by the warning message. (There will be rounding errors since the usage is only given to 2 decimals; also one is GiB and one is MB).\nYou can confirm the reserved block fraction using the dumpe2fs utility. For example, using my own boot partition:\nsudo dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | less\n\nI can see that\nBlock count:              248832\nReserved block count:     12441\n\nfrom which the reserved percentage is 12441/248832 x 100 = 5.00% as expected.\nThe reserved block fraction can be modified using the tune2fs utility, however I would not recommend doing that in this case - it's more appropriate for large (>TB) and/or non-system disks.\n\nA: Temp files can take several gigabytes, so a few free gigabytes is not much.\nTry cleaning your computer with WinDirStat (runs on Wine perfectly well). That will give you a graphical overview of where your disk space is going.\nAlso, you could use WinDirStat when you get a warning to check if the free space you think there is, isn't taken by some temporary file.\nThere are alternatives to WinDirStat that run native on Linux like KDirStat, but I always found WinDirStat to be better.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Do an apt-get clean to remove old package files and apt-get autoremove to remove unnecesary dependencies. Do du -hs /var/log to see if you have vry large logfiles.\n", "Q: Script to open terminal and show the output of the running commands I preface this by saying I am pretty much a complete noob when it comes to script writing.\nAnyway, I am looking to create a script that opens a terminal in the GUI environment of Ubuntu, and when it does, shows the output of the other commands running in the script. \nThe reason for this is I am looking to take the script, throw it into the directory that runs scripts on log in and have it opening a terminal, run my normal update scripts and then keep the terminal open to allow me to continue after.\nMy reason is basically to just get more experience, and I figured to automate something I do every time I login.\n\nA: \nI want to run 1 script. Basically I want on login to have terminal automatically open, and then have apt-get update/upgrade/dist-upgrade run, showing the output in that screen. That's all. \n\nMake sure your script is executable and add this command to Startup Applications:\ngnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; exec bash\"'\n\nThis will open gnome-terminal, which will start a non-interactive bash shell (which will run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade) and will later replace the current shell with an interactive bash shell.\nIf you have sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade already in a script, it would probably be more pratical to set Startup Applications to launch the script and maintain the script instead of the command in Startup Applications:\ngnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"/path/to/script.sh; exec bash\"'\n\n\nA: This command also works perfectly :\nxfce4-terminal -x /usr/bin/expect -c 'spawn /usr/bin/bash ; expect \"$ \" ; send \"update\" ; interact ; exit'\n\nYou need to check if expect is in the bin path. Otherwise install the package.\n", "Q: DNS goes missing with Static IP via NetworkManager I know there's plenty of posts/threads/questions/tutorials regarding ubuntu's DNS, network manager innards, and changes in the like between versions ~12 to 14-15+. I'm on ubuntu 12.04, and looking to upgrade soon, but first I need to verify some back up data, etc. and would also like to figure out this issue with NM.\nIn fact, I initially used one of the tutorials out there which did all the jumping-through-hoops with manually editing /etc/network/interfaces, etc., but it ultimately did not work. Some tutorials simply point to using the GUI, and that mostly worked (was able to browse the web; not so with the manual approach) so that's where I've ended up, with this DNS issue as an exception.\nMy DHCP works with with our internal dns, allowing me to use a name rather than an ip addr for example with an ssh command.

I would be happy to provide some output from dig given a specific incantation (still learning dig, not sure which output would be most helpful). I feel like this is very close to working (at least relative to my DHCP connection), but this issue stands in the way still. Any help troubleshooting is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Wow, okay. I got it to work. Here's what I found: from thrashing around trying to get the manual method to work, I had left the dns=dnsmasq line commented out in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. By re-enabling that line, the issue was fixed, no reboot necessary. Ping now resolves the names correctly, although the nmcli output did not change at all, which is interesting.\nDoes anyone know: is this expected behavior? I had the impression that the dnsmasq was accessory to NM utilities, but apparently not. Also: explain why the nmcli output did not change.\nI made this post an answer, in case no one else comes along to explain things (but of course would prefer some insight if others were to contribute).

Under custom keyboard shortcuts I have tried xterm ~/Desktop/folder/subfolber/textfile but that does not work.\nIt's my understanding that keyboard shortcuts are terminal commands.

But if I type sh ~/Desktop/folder/subfolber/textfile in terminal I can run the text file, but then this shortcut does not work if I try and add it via keyboard options.  \nAny clarification is appreciated.\n\nA: Keyboard shortcuts are commands but they belong to daemons, such as gnome-settings-daemon or unity-settings-daemon.  In case of X-server in general, regardless of which GUI you use, shortcuts may be altered with xbindkeys app. \nHowever, in your specific case, what you really need to make xterm open and run a script is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom;\n\n*Add a new shorcut; tell it to run xterm with full path to the script , e.g., xterm -hold -e /home/user/bin/myScript.sh\n\n*Assign keypress to it.\n\n\nNote: script must be made executable with chmod 755 /path/to/script.sh\nHere's my example:\nScript in /home/serg/testScript.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nprintf \"This was a triumph\\nI'm making a note here, huge success\"\ndf\ndate\n\nShortcut setup\n\nOutput\n\nCheck out my other answers that assign scripts to shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Program to take 2/3 and 1/3 of screen?\n\n*Terminal Short-cut ctrl + alt + T, 2 terminals, different size\n\n*How can I automatically add workspaces, only if I need them?\n", "Q: Trouble installing rspec I am trying to install rspec 2.9.9, as I am working through a course that isn't compatible with 3.

They can report up to 5-finger actions.\nThe kernel module reports only positions of the fingers. All kinds of \"actions\" like \"swipes\", \"scrolls\", \"taps\", etc. are detected and interpreted by user space drivers.\nIn Ubuntu xserver-xorg-input-synaptics is used. It can detect only 2-finger swipes, vertical and horizontal.\nThere is no code that detects 3-finger swipes. The only way to add this feature is to code it into the user space driver.\nThere is another user space driver libinput, that will be used in future releases of Ubuntu and is currently used in some other Linux distributions, e.g. Fedora.\nIt can be installed to Ubuntu this way. But the problem is that it can be installed only through xserver-xorg. That is way it does not increase overall functionality, if I got the method right.\nBut it is worth testing.\nIn some other desktop environments like Wayland it may be possible.\n\nA: You should try comfortable-swipe-ubuntu.\nI'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, but it says it works for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and above.

Im trying to connect to a WD My cloud network drive. Ive got it mounted as an NFS share, but if I use LS or have a program acsess it, everything hangs and never becomes responsive. I belive if I turn off the colors for ls it will work. So its something file related I guess.\nOne weird thing, I had been backing up to it using crashplan on windows, but I decided to try moving it to a new share since it puts a ton of files on the drive and makes searching take forever. Once I removed it, suddenly it worked. Then I added 2 torrents to Transmission and things downloaded for a bit, and the issue came back suddenly. \nAnyone got any ideas? I really want to be able to use this drive since it wasnt exactly cheap, and I cant expand the storage in my server machine, its an older HP media slim machine. So theres no room to expand it. Its not super old, it had vista on it, so it shouldnt be a lack of hardware power. \n\nA: This seems to mostly have been related to NFS protocol taking up a ton of CPU. Moving to local downloads, then transfering the complete file to the NFS share has fixed most of my issues\n", "Q: terminal window displays 'my: command not found' My terminal in Ubuntu 14.04 starts of with I don't know the reason for this cause \nmy: command not found\nuserID@userID-ubuntu:~$\n\n\nA: It appears that you are likely looking for a misplaced word, my, in some bash startup file.  Try:\ngrep -w my ~/.bash* ~/.prof*\n\nThe option -w specifies that we are looking for a word, not just two characters.  This means that grep -w my will match my but not myself or enemy.\nThis searches the common bash config files for the word my.  These files include ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile.  If you don't find the problem there, you may need to expand the search to the system-wide config files such as /etc/profile and /etc/bash.bashrc.\nThe above approach is simple but not comprehensive.  In part, this is because it is possible that the problem is not in one of the standard files mentioned above but in some some that those files source.

My stopgap solution is to use an AWS g2.2xlarge Instance which infuriates me but at least it does work. \n", "Q: Problem with Ipython notebook and Pyzmq, (plus Jupyter) I had trouble installing Ipython, but fortunately I tried version 3.2.1 and everything went ok and I can run Ipython, but I still can't run Ipython notebook.\n$ ipython\n\nPython 2.7.9 (default, Apr  2 2015, 15:33:21) \nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\nIPython 3.2.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\n\n\n$ ipython notebook\n...\nImportError: IPython.html requires pyzmq >= 13\n\nI tried to install pyzmq and I got the following error:\n$ sudo pip install -U pyzmq\n...\nWarning: Failed to build or run libzmq detection test.\n\n\n\nIf you expected pyzmq to link against an installed libzmq, please check to make sure:\n\n\n\n    * You have a C compiler installed\n\n    * A development version of Python is installed (including headers)\n\n    * A development version of ZMQ >= 2.1.4 is installed (including headers)\n\n    * If ZMQ is not in a default location, supply the argument --zmq=<path>\n\n    * If you did recently install ZMQ to a default location,\n\n      try rebuilding the ld cache with `sudo ldconfig`\n\n\n\n      or specify zmq's location with `--zmq=/usr/local`\n       ...\n          compilation terminated.\n\nerror: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1\n\nI copied only the error because there are hundreds of lines executed by the shell. \nInformation :\nPython Version 2.7.9\nI have Anaconda, (don't know if it changes anything)\nUbuntu 15.04 \nI have Canopy (Python IDE) installed (don't know if it changes anything)\nEDIT : I was trying some other stuff, and then I decided to try to install jupyter.

I'm trying to install and run ndiswrapper so i can use its proper driver to get the Internet. It says it is installed on the Ubuntu Software Center but it wont run on the computer. Is it because the program isn't compatible with 14.04? or am i missing a step?\n\nA: I've never managed to make ndiswrapper work, but that's fine because 90% of the time I can usually get a driver that does work using synaptic package manager or the \"additional drivers\" tool.\nOut of curiosity I did a search regarding your device and linux and found this solution.

I have been doing manual updates effectively biweekly with sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. This has worked out well until about last week when I could not reboot post update, the machine locks up and becomes unresponsive on decryption. In order to boot now, I navigate into advanced settings in grub and choose 3.19.28 Generic rather than 3.19.30 Generic and everything seems to work just fine.\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: I don't have a solution for the kernel 3.19.30, but a workaround. You have a working kernel as you say. Use this kernel in the meantime. Follow the steps below to remove the problematic kernel and avoid an automatic update for some days.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the package linux-generic\nsudo apt-get remove linux-generic\n\n\n*Remove the problematic kernel\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-3.19.0-30-generic\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-extra-3.19.0-30-generic\n\n\n*After some days or after the next minor kernel version update,\nreinstall the package linux-generic and test the behavior\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\n\n*If the kernel works now, all is fine.

My issue is that my head must be within ~20 inches from the machine at all times, with my head turned to the left, so that the right earphone is pointing towards the machine, otherwise the audio will be terribly jumpy (0.1-2 second break in audio every 0.5-1.5 seconds of clean audio).\nIs this a hardware issue with my laptop?

Also, technically EOL releases are off-topic here.\n\nThe kernel boot parameter profile is a trigger for readahead profiling at boot-time. If it is set a readahead daemon will monitor the boot process , look for files that are loaded during boot and write an appropriate list file. This file will be used on the next boot and should cut down boot-time by reducing hard-drive seeks.\nThere are a few such readahead mechanisms that came and went over the years. Here is my take on them and I hope this to be more or less accurate.\nOriginal readahead (deprecated)\nThe last version found in the the Ubuntu archives dates back to 2005. You can't install it anymore through the repository. I don't know when it was superseeded, but it must have been sometime before 10.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*profile stored in /etc/readahead/boot.\n\n*trigger profiling by moving boot and booting with kernel parameter profile, although this bug report suggests its an undocumented and developer-only option.\n\n\nreadahead from Fedora\nOriginally from Fedora and still used there for systems not booting with systemd.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu package is readahead-fedora. Available through the repository.\n\n*superseeds the original readahead\n\n*profiles stored in /etc/readahead.d/custom.{early,later}\n\n*profiling triggered by either\n\n\n*\n\n*touch /readahead_collect or\n\n*setting kernel parameter profile on boot.\n\n\n*automatically profiles at least every month\n\n*Superseeded on Ubuntu by ureadahead\nThe original readahead and readahead-fedora created a list of files needed at boot time. This list would be read at boot in an order that minimizes hard-drive seeks.\nureadahead\nThis is the default on Ubuntu since - I think - 10.04. \n\n\n*\n\n*Pre-installed\n\n*Really creates a page file which is loaded into memory at boot.\n\n*Stored in /var/lib/ureadahead/pack. To force profiling at next boot, remove this file.\n\n*Installs dpkg triggers, that fire and update the page file whenever something is installed that relates to init.\n\n\nUbuntu >= 15.04\nsystemd is the default init system since vivid. It brought its own readahead mechanism. ureadahead does not work with systemd. But even systemd-readahead is now unmaintained and deprecated, since apparently everbody owns a SSD these days... ureadahead is used on Vivid when booting with upstart.\n\nAs expected your system has ureadahead installed, which doesn't take the profile parameter. Why you would experience prolonged boot time after setting profile is not understandable. If you also applied the second hack in the how-to you followed (CONCURRENCY=...), this might be the culprit. upstart should take care of that on its own.\n\nAs said before, to force ureadahead to re-profile, remove the pack file\nsudo rm /var/lib/ureadahead/pack\n\nand possibly any other .pack in that directory. Be sure to login quickly after boot, because ureadahead records a bit even after booting has finished. This way it will hopefully also include the unity shell or whatever you're using. \nIf you want a really good grasp on what is taking how long to start, take a look at bootchart. It generates a graphical representation of the boot process.\n", "Q: How and from where to download the full DVD of Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS? From where can I download full ISO of Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS?\nI downloaded an ISO of Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server.\nThis ISO only contains 191 packages.\nThus I need a complete full ISO of Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS.\nPlease suggest me the location and path of the full ISO of Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS.\n\nA: Using local packages\nWhat do you mean by full? If it would contain all the available packages, it would not be a DVD. Probably even a BD would be too small. If you need additional packages for offline installation, you can download them with apt:\nsudo apt-get --download-only install package-name\n\nThen you can make an image yourself, if you want.\n\nCreating an Ubuntu mirror\nIf you want to create an entire mirror, you can use Rsyncmirror, it has an extensive guide.\n", "Q: Totally new to Ubuntu.

Purple screen hang while booting in windows 7. Tried boot-repair not working. Pls suggest something.Command line Image Gparted Image\n\nA: In GParted a lock icon beside a partition indicates the partition is mounted or otherwise active.\nFrom the screen shot it appears that you are running GParted from the Ubuntu partition (/dev/sda9) on your hard disk.  As such you will not be able to unmount /dev/sda9 because this would be like pulling the carpet out from underneath yourself.\nTo be able to edit any partition, boot from media other than the hard drive you wish to modify.  For example boot from your Ubuntu Live image and deactivate swap (Partition -> Swapoff), or alternatively boot from GParted Live.\nNote that the fdisk command line messages are simply indicating that the /dev/sda3 partition is neither cylinder nor MiB aligned, and that the logical partitions were not created in ascending order on the disk.

Before I had a normal Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS running. Anything worked pretty good.\nNow starting up my machine the network drivers are not working for both, ethernet and wlan.\nAccording to the ServerFaq one of the differences between Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop are missing desktop packages. So since Desktop was working, I expected the Server to run on my machine the same way (without gui of course).\nSo my question is: If the missing desktop package (i.e. ubuntu-desktop) really is the main difference between Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server, does it include any additional network drivers then or why does Ubuntu Desktop work with my laptop and Ubuntu Server does not? \n\nA: Thanks to the comments and some research I found an answer for my question.\nUbuntu Desktop comes with Network Manager while Ubuntu Server configures its interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces.\nIn my special case the setup in this file was incorrect which caused the problem. In case of Ubuntu Desktop the Network Manager was able to automatically configure my interface.\nLast thing to mention is that it is quite easy to install Network Manager also on Ubuntu Server. I used this documentation which comes unfortunately only in German.\n", "Q: Cannot find my Déjà Dup Backup Tool hi I am trying to back my home directory up and I know that I have Déjà Dup Backup Tool installed but for  some reason I cannot get to find it in order to back my files up.

I found this: \n   When bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it  appears  there,  and\n   uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:\n          if [ -n \"$BASH_ENV\" ]; then . \"$BASH_ENV\"; fi\n   but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the file name.\n\nIt is really interesting as you can set BASH_ENV to a file that runs specific commands each time you use \"su simple_user -c\" without requiring to load the full interactive logic. \nSo, before executing su simple_user -c, you can simply do:\nexport BASH_ENV=~/.bash_script\n\nAnd set things in your simple_user .bash_script file, like: \nexport TEST=\"Hello\"\n\nThen when I execute the \"simple_user_service\" script, \"Hello\" is properly printed.\nIt was really usefull for me as I needed this to load all the \"rvm\" environment (ruby) to run a specific script. \nWant to know more?\nWhy all this trouble? \nBecause I installed ruby god: http://godrb.com/ to monitore this specific script (a delayed job one).\nAnd I'm using \"rvm\" to manage different rubies. \nAnd the script automatically drop privileges if necessary by executing exec su application_user -c \"/bin/bash application_script\"\nAs god needs to run with root privileges and rvm is only loaded in .bashrc/.profile files, I needed a way to properly load rvm environment in my script. I could simply add the rvm load command in the script, but then my script would have been environment dependant and that was not acceptable. \nSo I added this in my script before privileges are dropped:\nif [ -e \"config/BASH_ENV\" ]; then\n  export BASH_ENV=$(cat config/BASH_ENV)\nfi\n\nThanks to that I can load rvm in the file I set in the config/BASH_ENV file. For instance it could be:\n# In config/BASH_ENV file of your rails app:\nexport BASH_ENV=\"~/.bash_script\"\n\n# In /home/simple_user/.bash_script \n[[ -s \"/etc/profile.d/rvm.sh\" ]] && . \"/etc/profile.d/rvm.sh\" # Load RVM function\n\nThen, my script and god work as expected.\nI did not explain all those things before getting answers so that readers could focus on the real question. \nBut as I got a good answer and found a good solution thanks to that, I wrote this edit so that it may be useful to others. \nThanks again!\n\nA: When you do:\nsu some_user -c 'some_command'    \n\nThe some_command will be executed as:\nbash -c 'some_command'\n\nAssuming bash is some_user's shell defined in /etc/passwd.\nNow when you do bash -c 'some_command' you are basically spawning a non-interactive (and of course non-login) session of bash. As no file is sourced by the shell while in non-interactive mode so no file is being read expectedly.\nNote that ~/.profile is sourced in a login, interactive session of bash and ~/.bashrc is sourced in a non-login, interactive session of bash. Also note that Ubuntu sources ~/.bashrc from ~/.profile. \nCheck the INVOCATION section of man bash to get more idea.\n", "Q: How to install Adobe Acrobat Reader DC in Ubuntu?

My Ubuntu 15.04 menu font is much smaller than that of the title bar. I want to make them the same size, and I have tried Ubuntu Tweak and Tweak Tools, but no matter what I change, the size of default font, desktop font, monospace font, document font, or window title bar font, the menu font size just keep unchanged. I do not want to adjust the text scaling factor, because that has global effects on the system. Dose anyone has the solution?my screen shot\n\nA: I had a similar problem with the font size of the file manager content windows after connecting my laptop to an external display, messing with screen resolution, then disconnecting it.  To restore proper font proportions, I ran the fc-cache command in a terminal, then logged out and back in (using the gui menu, not just sourcing my .profile from the terminal). \nfc-cache -rv\n\nThat fixed the font size for me.  \n", "Q: Login loop after enabling Intel Virtualization in BIOS After Enabling Intel Virtualization technology and VT-x in the Bios of my Lenovo x230 (I needed it for Virtual Box), Ubuntu (14.04) will start normally until the Login screen appears.

It shows an error\n\nwrong distribution  \n\nI assume the driver was part of the Problem.\nHope this helps somebody\n", "Q: Cant find terminal app in Ubuntu store I got my bq Aquaris E5 today and I like it, but I cant find the terminal.

Put it back in the newer machine,  remove the HD password in the BIOS and everything works great. \n\nA: A message such as \"Error fsyncing/closing /dev/sdb1: Input/output error\" often indicates a hardware problem.  This can be as simple as a loose cable, or as serious as a failing drive.\nWhen the error occurs, you can check the output of the dmesg command for any additional details.\nAlso some hard drives include smart monitoring.  You might try using gsmartcontrol to see if there are any indications of poor health for the drive.\n", "Q: dpkg / apt-get conflicting information When I run dpkg -l, I get a list of installed packages, and I'm comparing that to a \"model\" system that I'm attempting to reproduce.

So I made a bootable USB with Ubuntu on it, followed all the instructions to try and recover my files from my HDD but I can't see any of my files in the file manager. There is a 'XXXGB' option of device and a 'system' option and both seem to open ok (no messages about mounting errors) but my files just aren't there.\nAm I doing something wrong? Do I need to do something in the terminal? \n\nA: It is most likely that your Windows partitions aren't in /etc/fstab, you should try:\nmkdir /media/windows\nmount /dev/sdxY /media/windows\n\nWhere x is the disk letter and Y the partition number.\nRepeat the mount command for every windows partition and you'll be able to access your windows partitions in:\n/media/windows\n\n", "Q: tail a log file but show only specific lines I'm tailing a log file with -f flag. Then I'm piping this to grep, to find only lines that contain \"X\". That's working perfectly fine.\nNow I want to pipe this again into another grep, that will remove all the lines containing \"Y\". When I add the second pipe, the file stop refreshing and it looks like no data is coming.\nThis is the command that works:     tail -f my_file.log | grep \"X\"\nThis is the command that doesn't:   tail -f my_file.log | grep \"X\" | grep -v \"Y\"\nHow should I structure this so that the command works?\n\nA: As the output of grep is buffered, use --line-buffered option of grep to enable line buffering:\ntail -f /path/to/log | grep --line-buffered 'X' | grep -v 'Y'\n\nIf your grep does not have the option, you can use stdbuf as an alternative:\ntail -f /path/to/log | stdbuf -oL grep 'X' | grep -v 'Y'\n\n\nA: I normally find more useful awk for these kind of logical checks:\ntail -f /path/to/log | awk '/X/ && !/Y/'\n#                           ^^^    ^^^^\n#                   this I want    but not this\n\nTested by having two tabs, one in which I keep writing seq 20 >> myfile and the other one having for example tail -f myfile | awk '/3/ && !/13/'.\n\nA: Another approach would be to use a single grep invocation instead of two and so avoid the buffering issue. Just use a regular expressions that matches lines consisting of 0 or more non-Y characters, then an X and then 0 or more non-Ys again till the end of the line\"\ntail -f /path/to/log | grep '^[^Y]*X[^Y]*$'\n\n", "Q: ubuntu make file question I have a little question on a make file, here is the code:\nKERNEL_VERSION := $(shell uname -r)\nKERNEL_MODLIB  := /lib/modules/$(KERNEL_VERSION)\nKERNEL_SOURCES := $(shell test -d $(KERNEL_MODLIB)/source && echo $(KERNEL_MODLIB)/source || echo $(KERNEL_MODLIB)/build)\nCPPFLAGS       += -DDRIVER_ERROR -DDRIVER_DEBUG\nobj-m   := main.o\nKDIR    := $(KERNEL_SOURCES)\nPWD := $(shell pwd)\ndefault:\n     $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules \nclean:\n     $(RM) main.ko.unsigned  main.mod.c  main.mod.o  main.o modules.order  module.symvers .main* .tmp_versions/*\n\nI want to know what does this code do:\n$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules \n\nthx for advance~~\n\nA: The command changes to the directory $(KDIR) and runs make from there to build the target modules.\n$(MAKE) is a macro which runs the make executable.

I've been trying to get GRUB to load for a long time (bordering on two years of attempts). I have windows 7 on a Sony VAIO (SVS151190X) and I am attempting to boot Ubuntu 15.04 through GRUB, but I can't get to GRUB...\nThis post is an overall extension of details of a similar/same problem posted in: https://askubuntu.com/questions/666690/cannot-boot-ubuntu-15-04-using-sony-vaio-with-win-8-1-pre-installed\nThings I've Tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use easyBCD (yes, I realized it only works with MBR based systems so\nI undid everything I did with that\n\n*Use bcdedit command in cmd in windows to change the path of {bootmgr} to /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi that didn't work, I ran boot-repair and used it to ONLY reinstall grub and then I went back to windows and change the path of {bootmgr} to /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi and still no success. Then I reset {bootmgr}'s path to the original windows path (/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi).\n\n*Then, I tried what was mentioned in other articles: replacing the bootmgfw.efi with the grubx64.efi file, but that did not work. There were many other efi boot files (ones for UEFI boot as stated in grub.cfg, which I used as a reference to figure out what some files did) in /EFI/Microsoft and /EFI/Boot. I replaced every single one with grubx64.efi (renamed of course). For each replacement I renamed the windows file from file.efi to file.win.efi.\n\n\nBy the way, I attempted to directly edit grub.cfg (carefully, using the files I was supposed to edit as reference, in addition to searching the file for all references to bootmgfw.efi. I only edited the list, and specifically the path when I renamed the windows files; nothing else (except right below the list where it has a path for one of the windows things). Now, the reason I had to do this was because sudo grub-update returned: \n/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of /cow.\nThis occurred after installing boot-repair in a live session, since before I install it boot-repair is just an unknown command...BUT then I tried it again right now in this live session (after sudo apt-get install grub) and it worked fine and I made sure the windows paths were set correctly, but that is not important until I actually gain access to grub.\nAlso, my BIOS only contains the options of booting off the internal HDD, external device, disk drive, or network. There are no options of selecting windows or Ubuntu, just HDD.\nI've viewed so many help pages, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to fix dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 on a Sony Vaio?\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10 and dual Boot with Windows 8 uefi on Sony VAIO SVS1512\n\n*How to understand Ubuntu UEFI Secure Boot install?\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Laptop/Sony/Vaio/Duo11/Trusty\n\n*How to fix dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 on a Sony Vaio?\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2227580\n\n*And many, many more that I can't remember\n\n\nSo, has anyone successfully dual booted Ubuntu with Windows, after the things I listed above did not work for you and you found a solution that did?\nHelp is much appreciated, thanks in advance.\nEdit: To clarify, Ubuntu is installed and so is the grub boot loader, I just can't manage to arrive at the grub boot loader when I boot my laptop.\n\nA: Many Sonys have cruddy firmware (EFIs) that refuse to launch anything but the Windows boot manager -- that is, EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. The only workaround I know of is to replace that file with GRUB (or, if Secure Boot is active, with Shim, with GRUB stored in its normal filename in the EFI/Microsoft/Boot directory). The Boot Repair program can do this automatically, but you must enter the Advanced menu and select the appropriate option, which is called something like \"back up and replace boot files\" (I don't recall the precise wording).\nAnother thing you might try is replacing the stock Windows installation with a fresh install from retail (not OEM) disks. See here for information on how to obtain various Windows installation media legally. The point of this procedure is to remove the manufacturer-specific cruft that infests most computers and that can add an extra layer of complexity to the boot process.\nThe most radical solution is to re-install everything in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, bypassing EFI-mode booting. The limitations in the Sony apply to EFI mode only, so a BIOS-mode boot should bypass these problems; however, such a conversion would be tricky to carry out without a full re-install, and even with a re-install, there will be problems. See my page on CSM issues for details.\nI know you say you've tried much of this and it hasn't worked. Unfortunately, your problem is that you've got a defective computer. If you hadn't had it for so long, I'd suggest you return it to the store for a refund, but I doubt if they'd take it back after two years.\n\nA: I seem to have managed to get to GRUB on a Vaio SVS1511T9ES. It was a long dance, with many weird steps, and obviously may or may not work for you (or any future readers), but posting here just in case it helps someone:\nDual boot Ubuntu 16.04 + Windows 7 UEFI — GRUB menu doesn't appear\n\nA: My situation after replacing the HD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using UEFI + Secure Boot\n\n*Installed Windows 10\n\n*Installed Ubuntu 19.04\n\n\nSystem is booting into Windows each time. No sign of Grub. In fact even going into Windows and select 'Advanced Boot Options' and 'Ubuntu' boots into Windows. \nBased on previous hard won experience with this machine (Sony Vaio S1513Z9E/B) the only way to get EFI to boot anything but Windows is to replace the file /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. \nNote that I have tried replace the boot record, also BCDEdit, to no avail. \nStep 1. Replace bootmgfw.efi\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Windows 10\n\n*run 'diskpart'\n\n*execute 'list disk'\n\n*select the boot disk, e.g. 'sel disk 0'\n\n*execute 'list vol' \n\n*select the EFI volume, e.g. 'sel vol 2'\n\n*Assign a free drive letter, e.g. 'assign letter=E:'\n\n\nThe Windows boot manager now have to be renamed and replaced by the Ubuntu 'shim64x' boot manager. This example apply to UEFI + secure boot only!\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /d E:\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\\n\n*move bootmgfw.efi bootmgfw_org.efi\n\n*copy E:\\EFI\\ubuntu*.efi \n\n*copy shimx64.efi bootmgfw.efi\n\n\nFrom E:\\EFI\\ubuntu\\ at least shimx64.efi and grubx64.efi will be needed. \nNow reboot the computer. It should boot into Grub. Grub have the menu alternatives Ubuntu and Windows 10. By choosing 'Ubuntu' it will boot Ubuntu, as expected. \nThere is a problem with the entry for Windows. It is still pointing to bootmgfw.efi, that will falsely boot Ubuntu. \nIn order to create a grub entry that correctly load Windows, proceed as follows. \n\n\n*\n\n*Find the blkid of the EFI partition, e.g. 'sudo blkid /dev/sda2' (sda2 would be the EFI partition. \n\n*You will need the value of the UUID field (not the PARTUUID). \n\n*Edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom to add the following entry, \nmenuentry \"Windows 10 UEFI\" --class windows --class os {\n    insmod ntfs\n    search --no-floppy --set=root --fs-uuid D604-55F0\n    chainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw_org.efi\n}\n\n\n*An alternative entry, same function. menuentry \"Windows 10 UEFI\" {\n    search --set=root --fs-uuid D604-55F0 --file /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw_org.efi\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw_org.efi\n}\n\n\n*Recreate grub config, e.g. 'sudo update-grub'. \n\n\nAfter this the grub menu entry 'Ubuntu' will boot Ubuntu. The menu entry 'Windows 10 UEFI' will boot Windows 10. \nNote that the 'bootmgfw_org.efi' refered to above is the original renamed Windows boot manager. It hat to be done this way since the Vaio refuse to boot any other file. Attempts to edit/reconfigure BCD to make it boot Ubuntu as intended by UEFI specification have failed. \n", "Q: Installing libpcre 3.35.X on ubuntu 14.04 I'd like to upgrade the version of cppcheck that is available on ubuntu from 1.68 to 1.70.

However, hddtemp needs to be run as root:\n$ hddtemp /dev/sda\n/dev/sda: open: Permission denied\n$ sudo hddtemp /dev/sda\n/dev/sda: ST3500418AS: 35°C\n\nSo, you will first need to give your user permission to run the command. Run visudo and add this line to the sudoers file (change linofex to your actual username):\nlinofex  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/hddtemp\n\nThat should let you run sudo hddtemp without needing to enter a password. \nNow, replace the line from your conkyrc file with:\n${alignr 10}${color}SSD M500 Crucial 120GB Temp ${color1}${exec sudo hddtemp /dev/sda | awk '{print $NF}'}\n\n\nA: You need to first start hddtemp as a background daemon with the commmand:\n hddtemp -d /dev/sda\n\n${hddtemp ...} is a conky built-in object. It connects to 127.0.0.1:7634\nby default to get the disk temperatures. You therefore need to start, independently, the hddtemp daemon which listens on this port and replies with\nthe information.\nAn alternative is to use ${exec hddtemp /dev/sda} which runs hddtemp \non each window update, and does not need a daemon.\n\nIf you just want the temperature, pipe the output into awk to\nget the next-to-last field (in my case) ie $(NF-1), or the last field\n$NF in your case:\n${exec hddtemp /dev/sda|awk '{print $NF}'}\n\n\nA: Another solution is to permit hddtemp with:\nsudo chmod +s /usr/sbin/hddtemp\n\nThen (based on your example), in your conkyrc file the item will become:\n${execi 1 hddtemp /dev/sda|sed 's%/dev/sda: %%' }\n\nThis will give you just Crucial_CT120M500SSD1: 39°C.\n", "Q: LAMP stack in Ubuntu I would like to install a LAMP stack in Ubuntu Server and going to use sudo apt-get install lamp-server^.\nPrior to this I would like to ask what is the difference between using this method and between installing each element separately?\nThere are many guides which go the second way.\nAlso, is it possible to know which versions of PHP, MySQL and Apache are going to be installed without actually installing them?

I was told that I could bypass the password if I booted with a Linux OS.  This is my last resort before simply ditching the computer.\n\nA: You're not looking for Ubuntu. There is a Linux distro which is designed to kick the password query out of the ram of Windows. However, since as a Windows user you don't know how to make a bootable device, it'd be easier just to use the protected mode / save mode (whatever it's called on Windows, everyone I know uses Windows in German, therefore I only know the German word for it) to replace the password with whatever you want to replace it with. If you boot in the protected mode / save mode, you can log into the admin account without password.

This is a hosed system caused by updating my laptop while xorg-edgers ppa was in my repository list. This created a system with (in my case) the symptoms below. Un-installing and re-installing after purging the xorg-edgers ppa does not fix the issue.\nI have an Asus N56J laptop with Ubuntu 14.04.  It has an Nvidia 840M GPU. When I first built the machine I used the directions in http://www.binarytides.com/install-nvidia-drivers-ubuntu-14-04/\nto add drivers for the nvidia GPU. All went well and everything ran perfectly. However, I did use the PPA from xorg-edgers and left that ppa in my list of repositories.\nYesterday, I got an Ubuntu update message so when ahead and did the update. The Kernel was updated to 3.16.0-50 and I am now showing a 14.04.3 release. But this update broke the system in a number of ways that make the system unusable.\nThe symptoms so far are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox will become unresponsive if you go to certain web pages (maybe ones with video?).  The screen greys out and never comes back.\n\n*The backlit keyboard no longer lights up with the f3 or f4 buttons as it used to\n\n*The mouse pointer goes away after you have been logged in for 30 seconds. If you wait about 1 minute, it comes back. \n\n*Cntl-Alt-T no longer brings up a terminal window unless you have already started a Terminal window via clicking an Icon.\n\n*The system will no longer shut down. You have to hard power it off.\n\n*The system will no longer suspend when you close the screen.\nI suspected that having the xorg-edgers repository was my issue as they have a warning saying not to upgrade your system without doing a ppa-purge of their repository. I did not do an upgrade of course but I thought it could be related. I have since did a ppa-purge of this repository and removed the nvdia drivers. This had no effect on my symptoms. \nI noticed that this latest update did update my nvidia drivers (well libcuda1-340:amd64 (340.76-0ubuntu1~xedgers14.04.4, 340.93-0ubuntu0.0.1),nvidia-340:amd64 (340.76-0ubuntu1~xedgers14.04.4, 340.93-0ubuntu0.0.1) and nvidia-opencl-icd-340:amd64 (340.76-0ubuntu1~xedgers14.04.4, 340.93-0ubuntu0.0.1)) so I thought maybe this was the issue.\nAny ideas on what I can try to fix this? I know I can re-install but would like to avoid that if possible. \nThanks again.\nUPDATE:\nI ended up reloading using the directions at: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2057342\nThat worked well although I had to restore /var/www/html directory and files. That got whacked. Interesting, mysql databases remained though even though the files are in /var.\nI have a working system again (yeah!). I also reloaded the nvidia-340 drivers from the official Ubuntu repository and they are working well. There is probably an easier way to fix this if I could have identified the offending package (maybe from xorg-edgers ?). \nLove this laptop and Ubuntu running on it. This was the first time something like this happened but it was a learning experience. Thanks again for the help.\nYet another Update:\nSomehow my machine has again reverted back to the same broken state. I am not sure how as I don't recall doing any updates.  I tried undoing minor configuration changes in /etc/default/grub (GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=\") as well as some changes to alsa to get the subwolfer working. Still it remains broken. I believe another rebuild is in my future. Its odd, as after the rebuild, everything works as it should. Then something suddenly breaks.  If I get this solved, Ill update it here.\nBottom line is my issue has nothing to do with the xorg-edgers repository.\nUpdate 3\nI am fairly convinced it is a problem with libdrm-intel1. If I revert back to  2.4.56-1~ubuntu2 by doing a sudo apt-get install libdrm-intel1=2.4.56-1~ubuntu2 it fixes my issue but not immediately. There seems to be some config related to this package that needs to be reset as well. For example, I un installed the alsa packages which forced me to re-install the ubuntu desktop. with libdrm-intel1=2.4.56-1~ubuntu2 installed, my system returned to normal. Upgrading that package and rebooting caused it to break again.\nIf anyone has any advice on how to further isolate what I think is a bug, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.\n\nA: You need to run these commands:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346 nvidia-prime\n\nThis will remove wrong drivers and install the correct ones.\n", "Q: Two VMs on my Ubuntu server cannot be pinged I created two RedHat VMs on an Ubuntu server.

The VMs that don't work have IP addresses with no MAC addresses. How do I make a VM's IP address have a MAC address?\n\nA: You need to choose proper networking mode for your VMs' network interface. Either choose bridged mode which will allow you to ping host and go to the internet, or host-only network (private network) which won't let you browse the internet but will allow you to reach the host.\nDo not choose NAT (which I suspect is your current mode).\n", "Q: Can't import .sql files in phpmyadmin I had exported databases from wamp and tried importing the same from phpmyadmin but it displays an error saying you probably tried uploading a file that was too large! Why? How should I solve it?\n\nA: You should check the upload_max_filesize value in your \"php.ini\" file: \nsudo -H gedit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n\n\nA: I had not made the database and was including the .sql files without creating the relevant databases. Now I created the databases and the .sql files are imported easily, without any problem! So there was no problem with the size of .sql files to start with.

Anyway, I bought an Intel NUC (5i3RYK). Ubuntu 15.04 works just fine and with no issues. Well, almost.\nThe only problem I'm having is that I can not make my headphones' microphone work with my NUC. The headset has two jacks (input and output). I was able to get sound output from the HDMI (adapter with a separate minijack audio output), but I simply can not make input work.\nI plugged the audio jack (the red microphone one) of my headset into the front input/output jack socket, but no sound input device is detected. Also tried with another headset to make sure that it's not the headset issue.\nI used alsamixer to make sure that there are no muted devices. The sound card clearly has a \"capture\" possibility and I can set a volume for it, but sadly it still doesn't work.\nWhen I do arecord -l, I get this:\n**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****\ncard 1: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC283 Analog [ALC283 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nSo the device is definitely there.\nAny ideas?

Are programs (like NetBeans, Android Studio, Code::Blocks) installed in the home directory? If not, then where?\nWhat is the usefulness of defining \"/\" and \"/home\" separately?\n\nA: When I installed Ubuntu on my new custom-built machine, I installed both my '/' and my '/home' on a single 50GB drive, planning to upgrade later. Two months later I got a 3TB drive brand new and had no idea what to do with it, so I decided to put it into my machine. Instead of now having both on 50GB I left the 50GB for / (AKA boot) and then mounted my /home directory on the 3TB. The benefit of this is that I can hold 3TB worth of info on my System without it slowing my boot speed down. \n\nA: Actual executable files typically go under /bin and /sbin , sometimes /opt, but \"Apps\", as they show up in dash search, are typically organized into *.desktop files under /usr/share/applications. Muru explains it quite well here and has plenty of relevant links. These are under root file system. \nIt is possible , howerver, to install apps in custom /home/bin directory from source, but that's rarely done for average-grade user. \nThe benefit of separating root and home filesystems is that your personal files will be intact in case something wrong goes down on the root partition. \n\nA: It's nice to have /home on a separate partition because if you upgrade or even reinstall your user data stays safe.\nAlso, it allows you to apply options to your home partition like encrypting your home partition without having a real impact on boot time.\n/opt is also sometimes on a separate partition I believe so that any downloaded source code can be kept during upgrades or even operating system failures.\nBut let's be honest though. When is Ubuntu gonna randomly fail? It's pretty trustworthy, not perfect, but good.\n\nA: By having /home on its own partition, one can install multiple Linux distributions (on other partitions/disks), and tell them each to mount /home from there. If one deletes some distributions, or messes with them until they don't work and have to delete them, /home is \"safe\" (on its own partition - DO NOT commit typos).  \nAlso, by having directories that might fill up (when the User's program goes awry) (e.g., /home,/var,/tmp) not sharing the partition with / (and /*) ensures that the system will have enough free disk space to run happily. I've seen systems trying to run with zero disk blocks free on /. In general, they can't. Logging doesn't work (and it wants to log about that), servers hang waiting for a disk write to complete, very, very ugly. I had to kill servers so I could delete temporary files, so I could clean up. All while the Suit was watching.\n", "Q: How to use 'unusable' disk space while installing ubuntu? My laptop used to have windows 7 which I had upgraded to windows 8.1 and then to windows 10 and along with them I used to have ubuntu. The disk partitions used to look like ([System Reserved], [recovery partition provided by dell], C [windows boot], E [documents, music and stuff], [swap], [ubuntu]). \nWhenever I ran in a problem and had to reinstall ubuntu, I would do so using the something else option (create swap and / partition, both logical partitions).\nMy hard disk crashed a few days ago and I had to replace it. So I installed windows 7 on it again and then upgraded to windows 10. Now I'm trying to install ubuntu like I always did.\nBut this time the disk space I leave for ubuntu is showing up as unusable in the setup. Windows has created a 450MB recovery partition this time and so (I think) the extra space which used to be marked 'free space' in disk management is now marked as unallocated (and so showing up as unusable in ubuntu setup).\nThe partitions look like this: ([System reserved], C, [unnamed Recovery Partition], E [documents and stuff], [unallocated])\n[System reserved]: System, Active, Primary Partition\nC: Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition\nE: Primary partition\nI have no idea how the recovery partition got created. Although googling it suggests that it is something new with win 8 and 10, it never got created on my old hard disk. There is no option to delete the recovery partition, right clicking it in disk management gives only a help option which links to a page for disk management.\nSo any solutions?\nEdit: I just remembered that when I did not have ubuntu installed, the E partition and free space, as a whole, would show up as extended partition in disk management, which is no more the case.\n\nA: Backed up data on the E partition. Solved the unallocated space problem as follows (everything in disk management):\n1.Removed E partition (delete volume), so now I have a big chunk of unallocated space.\n2.Created a simple volume using all of this unallocated space (again, call it partition E).\n3.Reduced the size of this volume (shrink volume). This is the point where everything changed. Earlier, the E partition was a primary partition, shrinking it was also keeping it a primary partition; but this time the partition changed from primary to logical (I don't know why) and the space, that would earlier show up as unallocated, now shows up as free space. The partition E and this free space now forms an extended partition.\n4.Proceed as usual to ubuntu setup, the free space is now usable.\nI don't know how does disk management decide when to mark a simple volume as primary or logical (there is no option to change it explicitly), but it worked.\n", "Q: How to get back the old \"menu\" on Ubuntu 14.04? I am attempting to setup a new install with a fully updated Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI recall in previous versions of Ubuntu there was a specific menu ability, which started off some type of symbol in the upper left-hand corner (memory fails me to recall exactly what)\nThis menuing allowed one to access all of the programs, system tools etc., without the need for superfluous add-ons. The operating system did this \"out of the box\".\nHow does one restore that menu system?\n\nA: The Ubuntu desktop has changed a lot over time.\nNow Ubuntu is using Unity, but you can use the classic-menu indicator to mimic the old gnome-shell behavior.\nTo install the latest version (0.11 for Trusty) open a terminal and execute the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:diesch/stable\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt-get install classicmenu-indicator\n\nAfter installing, go to the classic menu Indicator (last entry in the image) and select 'use old icon'.\n\n\nA: I believe UbuntuStudio had this type of menu on all versions up to and including UbuntuStudio 20.04. However, I can't speak for newer versions of UbuntuStudio like 22.04 because UbuntuStudio switched to KDE and I haven't tried the new desktop yet.\nOn UbuntuStudio 20.04 and older, they use a customized version of the XFCE4 desktop environment. Xubuntu and the XFCE desktop should give you a similar desktop setup and many users switched to XFCE when Gnome Shell was released. Therefore, Xubuntu or the XFCE desktop could be an option if you feel UbuntuStudio is too bloated and doesn't fit your needs (UbuntuStudio often includes either a suite of graphics software and/or audio software).\nAlso, Kubuntu and KDE use a basic menu setup but it may seem unfamiliar to you if you're used to GTK software. However, you might want to give it a try. Again, many users switched to KDE when Gnome Shell was released.\nOther options like Ubuntu Mate and Lubuntu offer a similar, more familiar desktop experience compared to Gnome Shell. Although again, Lubuntu uses QT instead of GTK.\nThere is a brief overview of all Ubuntu flavors on the Ubuntu website.\n", "Q: What should I do to get Ubuntu dual-boot with Windows 10 on this Toshiba laptop? I've tried several approaches and it still boots directly to Windows 10. It is a Toshiba Satellite Radius L15W-B1208X with Windows 10 the original OS.\nI read and tried to follow all prerequisite steps in this helpful information-packed answer, and first tried Ubuntu 14.14 LTS, which installed but showed no dual boot menu.\nVarious answers and sources such as this one have suggested I could then tell the UEFI to start with Grub 2, but I see no such option. This Toshiba's UEFI config menu has never shown anything but the hard drive and USB as boot sequence options. The only other relevant setting seems to be Safe Boot on/off, which has never seemed to have any effect on behavior at any point in the hours and hours (and more hours) of trying things I have done. There is no \"boot mode\" option as suggested here - I suppose it is UEFI-only (no legacy option)?\nThe info-packed answerer said 15.04 has always just worked for him, so although I would prefer LTS, I tried Ubuntu 15.04, telling it to replace the 14.14 installation, and it is installed, but is equally unbootable.\nI saw the suggestion that Toshiba may be violating the UEFI standard and annoyingly testing for \"windows\" in the file name and that I could rename the Linux bootloader to windows... but I don't know how to access the EFI partition - I assume I'd need to know how to find and mount it in Linux? I didn't see complete enough directions for my familiarity level, so I didn't try that.\nFollowing advice on the WindowsDualBoot page of the Documentation section of the Ubuntu web site, I tried using a EasyBCD and managed to wipe my BCD making Windows 10 unbootable but I actually managed to fix that thanks in part to Toshiba's recovery system.\nThe most recent thing I've tried is Linux Boot-Repair, which I ran in all its steps but it had no visible effect. Its docs say the final steps should be to show its output data to my favorite help source, so here I am, and here they are.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Some observations from your Boot Repair output:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are three sets of efibootmgr outputs, at 607-626, 1094-1109, and 1142-1157. It looks as if your system started up with the Ubuntu entries present but not listed in the boot order and Boot Repair tried to set one of these (Boot0004) as the default boot entry, but presumably that failed. This suggests a bug in either your EFI or in efibootmgr.\n\n*There are a number of efibootmgr errors that read efibootmgr: Could not delete boot variable: No such file or directory. This also suggests a bug in either your firmware or in efibootmgr.\n\n*There are a lot of duplicate NVRAM entries shown by efibootmgr, especially in its first run, which has duplicate entries for both Windows and Ubuntu. This suggests EFI bugs rather than efibootmgr bugs, since presumably something in Windows created multiple entries for some reason (which it might have done if it thought its entries were not being created).\n\n\nOverall, this looks like buggy firmware to me. You can check with your manufacturer to see if an update is available. If so, install it and try Boot Repair again. If that fails, you may still be able to work around it. First, try Windows. There are two things you might attempt:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download EasyUEFI and use it to adjust the boot order. This tool is pretty easy to use; just move the \"Ubuntu\" entry to the top of the list. If there are multiple entries, move one that refers to shimx64.efi, not one that refers to grubx64.efi.\n\n*Open an Administrator Command Prompt window (not the newer shell in Windows 10; the older classic Command Prompt) and type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi.\n\n\nIf these procedures both fail, you could try using an EFI shell and its bcfg command, as described here. Note, however, that you'll need to disable Secure Boot to get the EFI shell to launch, and you'll need to copy the shell program to a USB flash drive as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi, then boot that drive.\nIf all of this fails, I recommend you return the computer for a refund, on the grounds that its firmware is badly defective. If you do this, be sure to write to the manufacturer to say that you returned the product and why. It's only if manufacturers feel the pain of returns that they'll be motivated to fix their defective firmware. Dell, ASUS, Lenovo, and Apple deliver fairly usable EFIs. Sony and HP seem to be less reliable, judging by problem reports I've seen. I can't comment on other brands.\nIf you can't return the computer, you can try the Advanced tab of Boot Repair, which includes an option to rename and back up boot loader files. This places GRUB under the name of the Windows boot loader, which is an ugly and unreliable hack of a workaround for an ugly bug. I recommend doing this only as a last resort; it's far better to return a computer with firmware defective enough to need this sort of workaround.\n\nA: After updating the Bios from version 1.20 to 5.0 I was able to boot into Linux mint 17.3 x64.

Each software has its own functionalities and nginx is just another software that you can install on your ubuntu server and that will add the functionality to send back the files its asked for. Ubuntu will have port(s) that will be associated with nginx (and on which nginx will be configured to listen) so that each times Ubuntu receives a request specifically adressed to that port it will say to nginx \"hey, that IP said that to you\" and nginx will respond \"ok, answer that\". Everything that is not related to what nginx should respond to a request over its configured ports is managed by another software (bind9 for DNS, iptables for firewall restrictions, ...)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You must know how to use SSH, and how to install/configure software using commands. Also, I would say that ports would be a very important thing to know about in order to set a HTTP server.\n\n*Ubuntu Server is just like your operating system but without all \"useless\" stuff that is only needed for the comfort of the user. nginx is a server that takes a request that is addressed to your ubuntu server on a port that is associated with nginx (HTTP(S) is often 80(443)) and returns the file that was asked in the request. It may redirect the request to other software that will process the file and send back the response to nginx that will send it back to you\n\n*I would say Ubuntu first and then nginx as you will need to install/configure Ubuntu and then configure/install nginx from Ubuntu\n\n*There are plenty of good tutorials out there. This one seems to be a good one, it will teach you to install a server from scratch and to install services such as mail server (postfix/dovecot), http server (nginx/apache) and a DNS server (bind). It may be a too complete tutorial according to your needs but it may also be a good way to understand both environments.

Sometimes, when there are lots of other students logged in to the server, the connection is slow, and I lose work during connection timeouts. There are several servers to choose from in the lab, and I want to be able to automatically run who as soon as the connection is made, so I can see how crowded the server is, and use another one if it's pretty full. Right now, I use a function in my .bash_aliases file to streamline the connection and password entry:\nIn file ~/.bash_aliases:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ssh to the Linux lab. Takes hostnames defined in ~/.ssh/config as \n# parameters\nfunction sshll()\n{\n    if [ \"$@\" ]\n      echo \"Connecting to hostname $@\";\n      sshpass -f <password_file> ssh $@;\n    else\n      echo \"Connecting to default host\";\n      sshpass -f <password_file> ssh <user@ipaddress>;\n    fi\n}\n\nThis works, so I added who to the end of the ssh commands:\nIn file ~/.bash_aliases:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ssh to the linux lab. Takes hostnames defined in ~/.ssh/config as \n# parameters\nfunction sshll()\n{\n    if [ \"$@\" ]\n      echo \"Connecting to hostname $@\";\n      sshpass -f <password_file> ssh $@ 'who';\n    else\n      echo \"Connecting to default host\";\n      sshpass -f <password_file> ssh <user@ipaddress> 'who';\n    fi\n}\n\nThis connects, enters my password automatically, and runs who, but then closes the connection. Is there a way I can run who automatically, without closing the connection afterward?\n\nA: TL;DR: int_ua's answer is the way to go, simplest and effortless.\nWhy this works the way it does\nThis goes back to the basic behavior of any shell. When you login simply as ssh user@server.domain.whatever you get interactive version of the shell. When you run ssh user@some.server.net -t \"command1;command2\" you basically get /bin/sh -c 'command1;command2'. The first one lets you run whatever you put into the stdin while sourcing  the dot files, while second just executes those commands and exits. Essentially, there is no way to run a command before interactive use ( unless it is in one of the dot files ) or get an interactive shell from the single-shot command sh -c (or whichever shell it may be, not necessarily sh ).\nFailed or incomplete ideas\nMy first idea I had is this : if the shell uses server's local .bashrc , could one make it use client's local file on the server ? Well,no. Not unless you copy the dot file over to remote server with scp or rsync.\nSecond idea that i had is the PROMPT_COMMAND. This very nice bash variable runs command each time before showing your PS1 prompt, so why not set this variable before  spawining bash to PROMPT_COMMAND=\"who; unset PROMPT_COMMAND\" so that we run it as single-shot? \nProblem is this variable has to be exported to the remote server, and Gilles answer helped me to do something like this:\nssh -o SendEnv=PS1 ssh localhost -t bash\n\nor \nssh localhost -t \" PROMPT_COMMAND='who; unset PROMPT_COMMAND' bash  \"\n\nProblem ? -o option SendEnv must allow that specific variable that you are trying to send in /etc/ssh/sshd_config , and besides in either case you still get to run all that stuff with /bin/sh -c\nSlight improvement to int_ua's answer\nSo by now we can see that ssh user@server -t 'command1;shell' pattern works the best. Except there is one minor nitpick: /bin/sh -c process is still there , so why not run bash with exec to replace that process out?\n ssh user@server.net -t 'who;exec bash'\n\n\nA: Just executing bash should be enough:\n sshpass -f <password_file> ssh <user@ipaddress> 'who; bash';\n\n\nA: This is an answer, but definitely not the answer.\nI discovered that sshd (the daemon for ssh services on the remote host) will run commands in ~/.ssh/rc upon connection. I just created this file, and added who there, and now a list of users is displayed every time I make a remote connection, and I still get a login shell.\nOn remote host:\nFile ~/.ssh/rc:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This file is executed by sshd when a remote connection is started over ssh\nwho\n\nOn client:\nIn file ~/.bash_aliases:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ssh to the linux lab. Takes hostnames defined in ~/.ssh/config as \n# parameters\nfunction sshll()\n{\n    if [ \"$@\" ]\n      echo \"Connecting to hostname $@\";\n      sshpass -f <password_file> ssh $@;\n    else\n      echo \"Connecting to default host\";\n      sshpass -f <password_file> ssh <user@ipaddress>;\n    fi\n}\n\nI am still interested in knowing how to do this from the client side, however, for other users with similar problems who can't use ~/.ssh/rc for lack of permissions, or whatever other reason.\n\nA: int_ua's answer is what I'd use. Just for completeness, if you can edit your own .profile or .bashrc on the remote server, you could append this to either one:\nif [[ -n $SSH_TTY ]]\nthen\n    who\nfi\n\nSSH sets various variables, one of which is SSH_TTY - you can test for these variables to determine if you're connected via SSH. Restrictions on ~/.ssh/rc should not prevent you from using this.\n\nI use this to set my prompt (note how I skip the hostname for local shells):\nif [[ -n $SSH_TTY ]]\nthen\n    PS1=\"\\u@\\h:\\w \\$ \"\nelse\n    PS1=\"\\u:\\w \\$ \"\nfi\n\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I wonder why nobody mentioned expect, that seems to be just designed for such cases.

Note that Ubuntu and Windows are installed on different disks, so nothing can be run with wine\n\nA: You can do this with virtualbox if you set up the VM with no virtual HDD, and instead, give it the disk with the windows install as the virtual SATA 0 port.  It should boot just fine, maybe have to go through some driver installs, but it should all come out in the wash.\nWhy you would want to do this in a VM is beyond me, unless you have servers running in Ubuntu.  Why not just boot into Windows?\nAlso, make sure you allocate enough RAM for the VM.  You can always tone down Windows 7 to make it less resource intensive.

That worked great, but after rebooting my system and logging in, nothing loaded. I got the normal mouse cursor on a black background, then the cursor rotated to Counterclockwise, but nothing else happened (for however long i waited.) There was just the rotated cursor on a black background. No launcher, no wallpaper, no keyboard shortcuts working, no panel. Forcing shutdown with the hardware button and booting into recovery let me boot without Counterclockwise (or the resulting bug) kicking in, but in that recovery mode it's not possible to disable Counterclockwise again, because that setting is not adjustable in recovery mode. So when I then reboot normally again, the same lonely, rotated cursor appears again.\nEventually I just overwrote my whole Ubuntu partition with a Clonezilla image from a few days back. Now, if I want to continue using Counterclockwise view (which I do,) I have to switch it back to Normal every time I want to power down or reboot, and then switch it back to Counterclockwise again upon boot. I also have to keep regular Timeshift/Clonezilla backups in case my computer crashes or inadvertently powers down while in Counterclockwise mode. This is actually what I am doing at the moment, but it's hardly handy for a native function in the standard build.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I found a solution to this.

Every guide on burning a LiveDVD says it should have downloaded as an image.\nDid I do something wrong?\nHere's the contents of the folder, which is called \"ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64\":\n.disk(folder)\nbook(folder)\ncasper(folder)\ndists(folder)\nEFI(folder)\ninstall(folder)\nisolinux(folder)\npics(folder)\npool(folder)\npreseed(folder)\nautorun.inf\nmd5sum.txt\nREADME.diskdefines\nubuntu\nwubi.exe\n\n\nA: It's highly likely that the file you downloaded was a ZIP or that you have a program that extracts ISO files when you try to open them. The original ISO should still be in your Downloads folder, so use that. If you are using IE or Firefox to download it, make sure you use the Save or Save As... option and not the Open one.\nTo burn the ISO, you're going to need a program to do that. Windows 7 doesn't really have the capability to do this, although Windows 8 and above do. My personal recommendation is ImgBurn.\n\nA: Its an .iso file, isn't it. If yes, then you are good to go. The image they are talking about is an ISO image. By the way the best place to download Ubuntu is\nDownload Ubuntu Desktop\n\nA: When it says it should be downloaded as an image, it means a disk image.  That means it's a copy bit for bit of what the DVD should be.  You see it as a file, but it ends in .img or .iso or .dmg or somethign else like that.  It's not a .jpg like a photographic image, but it's still and image.  You're getting the right thing.  Just burn the .img or whatever it is to a DVD.\nAlso, you may have gotten a BitTorrent file instead, depending on where you downloaded it.  I would recommend only downloading from Ubuntu (or one of their mirrors) directly.  The BitTorrents can be a little shady sometimes.  They require a special client to download the real file/image/whatever.\n\nA: You downloaded an iso image file. But instead of burning it, you unzipped it.\nThat is wrong. You need to use some software and burn that image to DVD or a flash drive.\nYou can refer to this page.\nYou may have Windows without the burning software. In this case you can install one.\n\nA: I did the same thing a few times, unzip the folder as it automatically associates with winrar. Then I later right clicked and checked the properties of the winrar file, and it is actually an ISO file. I downloaded the file from the Ubuntu website and everything. Hope that sets your mind at ease. After you finish downloading the file you can make a spare usb flash drive bootable by using that file and then just install ubuntu via flash drive, no cd burning required. You can use unetbootin, rufus to do this.\n", "Q: What starts accounts-daemon?

So as you have used the static private IP address 192.168.1.109 for the server it won't be accessible from the Internet given no port forwarding is enabled for any port of the server.\nAlso note that your network address should be 192.168.1.0 and if you want to communicate to the internet from the server you should add the router's address as the gateway address. As your local IP address will be masqueraded by the public IP of the router for any outgoing request you will be safe in that case too. \nYou can optionally enable some packet filtering rules in iptables of the server for more fine grained firewalling.\nThe following network configuration should suffice: \nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.109\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nAssuming 192.168.1.1 is the gateway address.\n", "Q: Uninstall Intel Graphics for Linux 1.20 on Ubuntu 15.04 I recently installed Intel's Graphics Drivers for Linux in my Ubuntu machine sometime last two weeks ago. So then yesterday, I played Minecraft after some months and noticed that it goes to 100% CPU after some time (5mins after starting the game or so, and this doesn't happen a month ago) . I tried a bunch of tests including changing intel_pstate CPU governors, tinkering settings in Minecraft, and now I am suspecting Intel's Graphics Drivers as the culprit.

And so:\nOpen a new Terminal (CTRL+Alt+T) and execute\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/preferences.d/intel-removal\n\nPaste this code in the File and save it (don't forget to change the Ubuntu version if you're not using vivid):\n    Package: *\n    Pin: release a=vivid*\n    Pin-Priority: 1001\n\n    Package: *\n    Pin: origin download.01.org\n    Pin-Priority: -100\n\nAnd then (don't forget to change the dkms package below if it's not the same):\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nsudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/intel-removal\n\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intellinuxgraphics.list*\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get purge i915-4.0.4-3.19-dkms intel-linux-graphics-installer\n\n", "Q: Multi monitor setup reverts to clone after login on Kubuntu 14.04 When I boot up my computer and it gets to the logon screen, the display actually spreads across the two of them like I would expect.

Make sure that you do not have some leftover configs or scripts from your previous attempts. Especially, check at \"Startup and Shutdown\" \"Background services\" that KScreen is running. \nFinally, there is a \"rude way\". Disable KScreen maybe.

Yet, still loving the experience so what does that really say about me?\nI ran into an interesting problem that I'm not sure how to correct.

It should talk about why 7 servers are required and what their roles are, and also the networking requirements. Is there a real reference document anywhere?\n\n*Can I install MAAS controller and OpenStack controller on the same host?\n\nA: Good job for checking in here for a sanity check before just installing.  You shouldn't need a ton of servers for the minimum setup--I've put nearly everything on just three servers before:  1) MaaS plus juju, 2) all charms except nova-compute, 3) nova-compute.  And you then can scale out nova-compute onto more servers if you'd like.\nGiven that you might be doing this over and over and over again I would recommend not adding anything in the way of charms to your MaaS controller.  In fact, I'm not sure if you could if you wanted to.  MaaS will enlist other servers and apply an image to them.  With a single checkbox somewhere in the setup it will even erase the entire hard drive so it would be a bad idea to try to enlist the MaaS server itself.\nWhat's important to note in the way of documentation is that you'll find the OpenStack documentation not only on www.Ubuntu.com but also on help.ubuntu.com, OpenStack.org and jujucharms.com.\nStarting from this jujucharms URL, I was able to download their bundle.yaml file and edit it for my own needs.  Theirs assumes a four-server install (which will save you a couple of servers from the version you're trying to use).  Additionally, this approach uses the \"juju quickstart...\" syntax instead of the \"juju bootstrap...\" plus \"juju deploy...\" collective syntax.  Things will happen a lot faster and simpler, in other words.\nThe upside to juju quickstart is that everything seems to work better.  The downside to juju quickstart is that you don't run each command individually so you know a little less about what's going on.\nIf you don't want to use a charms bundle for OpenStack itself and like the idea of juju bootstrap, then check out this Ubuntu help page especially at Appendix I for an economic deployment.  But be careful about what version of OpenStack that you pull.  By default you might not get Kilo like you would using the bundle approach above.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu server starts as a black screen I just converted ubuntu desktop 14.04 to ubuntu server using these steps:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nsudo apt-get install tasksel\nsudo tasksel remove ubuntu-desktop\nsudo tasksel install server\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-server linux-image-server\nsudo apt-get purge lightdm\nsudo apt-get purge firefox\n\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up   \nsudo dhclient eth0\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen I installed Sentora.

First, you are not actually saving the name as $name. You nead read VARIABLE to save the entered string as $VARIABLE. You also don't need the echo but more on that later. \nNow, the syntax error you are getting is presumably this:\n\nline 6: ((: wget --spider http://example.com | grep *M >= 250M : syntax error in expression (error token is \"spider http://example.com | grep *M >= 250M \")\n\nThat's because you're using a very wrong syntax. The grep will print the entire line, not only the number on megabytes. Therefore, you are actually attempting to check whether  a line like this:\nLength: 272629760 (260M)\n\nis more than 250M and that makes no sense. In addition, the output of wget --spider is printed to standard error, not standard output so you need to redirect it to stdout in order to grep it:\nwget --spider $url 2>&1 | grep ...\n\nYou also need to filter out everything but the number itself. One way of doing this is with a positive lookahead, and -P for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) and -o to tell grep to only print the matching portion of the line:\ngrep -oP '\\d+(?=M)'\n\nIn PCRE, \\d means any digit and + means \"one or more\". The (?=foo) construct, the positive lookahead, will only match if the next characters are foo. So, the regex above will match one or more digits, followed by the letter M. \nSo, a working (and slightly improved) version of your script would be:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nread -p \"Name your file: \" name\nread -p \"Paste the url you wish to check: \" url\n\nif (( $(wget --spider $url 2>&1 | grep -oP '\\d+(?=M)') > 250 ));\nthen\n    wget -O $name $url\nelse\n    echo \"This is not what you are looking for.\"\nfi\n\nOr, for a more compact syntax that does the same thing:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nread -p \"Name your file: \" name\nread -p \"Paste the url you wish to check: \" url\n\n(( $(wget --spider $url 2>&1 | grep -oP '\\d+(?=M)') > 250 )) &&\n    wget -O $name $url ||  echo \"This is not what you are looking for.\"\n\n", "Q: Migrate form Windows 8.1 to Ubuntu I am a Linux noob and have got Win 8.1\nI wanna change to Ubuntu (by \"change\" I mean get rid of Win and permanently use Ubuntu) while keeping all the data in my computer (Videos, Pictures and some movies) intact and accessible while using Ubuntu. I got a drive partition Windows C:, Local disk D:, Local Disk E: and a DVD RW Drive F:.\nAnd is it possible to have some Windows applications up and running WHILE using Linux? (Like wordpad, excel, word, spreadsheet, database etc., you know for projects and stuff)\n\nA: \n(by \"change\" I mean get rid of Win and permanently change to Ubuntu) while keeping all the data in my computer (Videos, Pictures and some movies) intact and accessible while using Ubuntu. \n\nI would advice against this. If you want to keep your data and keep using a Windows formatted partition you will at some point need to fall back to Windows for maintenance of those partitions.\nIf you want to keep this data make a backup and format d:, e: etc into ext4 so it is native Linux and restore that backup to the Linux versions of these folders. \nOtherwise I would suggest you shrink the windows partition, create an unallocated partition and install Ubuntu into that. You will then have a system with 2 operating system (or a dual boot) and Ubuntu will happily let you use the Windows partitions to store and retrieve data from. That can be used to clear out your Windows partitions by moving your data to Ubuntu and then reformating those partition to a Linux version (ext4). \n\nLike wordpad, excel, word, spreadsheet, database etc., you know for projects and stuff)\n\nIf you want to keep hanging onto Windows: go dual boot. WINE is not worth your time.\nWordpad you do not need in itself as it is just a text editor. We got plenty that do a better job. Excel(=spreadsheet) and Word can be done with LibreOffice Calc and LibreOffice Writer. It is sort of the same but also a bit different (and some of the basic things are done differently so it can be annoying if you are used to Word). But the learning curve is not that difficult. Database: MySQL is the leading database and available. If you are familiar with Access the learning curve is not too difficult. \nAgain: I would advice to go dual boot. Get the hang of Ubuntu, get used to the software in Ubuntu, move your files over to Ubuntu, shrink Windows as much as possible and if you ever reach a moment where you can say \"hey I do not need Windows anymore\" remove it either from grub or actually from your system. \nPrepare for a disappointment but do your best to get the hang of Ubuntu. If you can not switch for whatever reason you can easily revert to Windows.\n\nAs an alternative you can also install Windows INSIDE Ubuntu using virtualization (with VMWare or VirtualBox). Works best with solid machine with lots of RAM though. \n\nA: Install Wine Application Loader \nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nor you can find alternate software instead.\nfor text editor using leafpad\nsudo apt-get install leafpad\n\nfor office suite, using libre office.\nAlso, you could find more about that... You will find more easy with Linux\n\nA: If you really want to take the plunge, \n\n\n*\n\n*create a LiveCD version of the Linux distribution you want to use.\nThis allows you to test drive various 'flavours' and only requires the time to do it.\n\n*move all data you want to keep to a separate partition.\nInstalling will overwrite your drives (There are exceptions, but they don't apply to you right now.) If you are fuzzy on partition read enough until you think you understand.  It will make life easier.\n\n*install Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Whateveruntu.\nI find a multi-partition installation gives more flexibility without the added drama, {Root(1),Home(2),Swap(3), or Root(1), Home(2), [data](3), Swap(4)}, more than that on a lone PC is playing with yourself.  Now you can switch distributions like you'd change clothes.\n\n*check out the native Linux applications first to see what does the same job adequately, the same, or better than your applications in the Windows world.  Every distribution has a \"notepad\" equivalanvent.  Already mentioned is the LibreOffice for the suite of things you might consider for a project.\nI do nothing specialized, so my application requirements are all met with open source applications which you should contribute to in time/talent/or funding as best as you are able  Gimp, Blender, Hugin are beyond my capabilities, and yet my SO wants the simplicity of Picasa.  It, or nearly all of 'it' is possible. Use Synaptic or *ubutu Software Manager until you realize CLI is faster and more fun.\nWine is for those who still find some Windows applications indispensable.  Most work, some flawlessly...others not so.  http://winehq.org for help, or someone else's experience. Installing Winetricks makes live easier.

In my mind, everything except daemons and nohup programs will be killed during logout. If sleep can survive in this way, does it mean that I can use this method instead of the nohup command?\n\nUnless the bash instance spawned by ssh has the huponexit option set, no process will be terminated by any mean upon exit / log out, and when the huponexit option is set, using kill -9 on the shell is not a good alternative to using nohup on the shell's child processes; nohup on the shell's child processes will still protect them from SIGHUPs not coming from the shell, and even when that is not important nohup is still to be preferred because it allows the shell to be terminated gracefully.\n\nIn bash there's an option called huponexit, which if set will make bash SIGHUP its children upon exit / logout;\nIn interactive non-login bash instances, such as in a bash instance spawned by gnome-terminal, this option is ignored; whether huponexit is set or unset, bash's children will never be SIGHUPped by bash upon exit;\nIn interactive login bash instances, such as in a bash instance spawned by ssh, this option is not ignored (however it is unset by default); if huponexit is set, bash's children will be SIGHUPped by bash upon exit / logout; if huponexit is unset, bash's children will not be SIGHUPped by bash upon exit / logout;\nSo in general exiting / logging out from an interactive login bash instance, unless the huponexit option is set, won't make the shell SIGHUP its children, and exiting / logging out from an interactive non-login bash instance won't make the shell SIGHUP its children regardless;\nThis is, however, irrelevant in this case: using kill -9 sleep will survive regardless, because killing its parent process (bash) won't leave a chance for the latter to do anything to the former (i.e., e.g., if the current bash instance was a login bash instance and the huponexit option was set, to SIGHUP it).\nAdding to this, unlike other signals (like a SIGHUP signal sent to bash), a SIGKILL signal is never propagated to a process's child processes, hence sleep is not even killed;\nnohup starts a process immune to SIGHUP signals, which is something different; it will prevent the process hanging up upon the reception of a SIGHUP signal, which in this case could be received by the interactive login bash instance in case the huponexit option was set and the shell exited; so technically using nohup to start a process in an interactive login bash instance with the huponexit option unset will prevent the process from hanging up upon the reception of a SIGHUP signal, but exiting / logging out of the shell won't SIGHUP it regardless;\nIn general, however, when nohup is needed to prevent SIGHUP signals coming from the parent shell, there's no reason to prefer the kill -9 on the parent method to the nohup on the child method; instead, it should be the opposite.\nKilling the parent using the kill -9 method doesn't leave a chance for the parent to exit gracefully, while starting the child using the nohup method allows the parent to be terminated by other signals, such as SIGHUP (to make an example which makes sense in the context of a child started using nohup), which allow it to exit gracefully.\n\nA: bash by default does not send down the HUP signal to child processes when exiting. More in detail (thanks @kos), it never does it for non-login shells. \nYou can configure bash to do it for login shells if set the option huponexit. In a terminal, do: \n[romano:~] % bash -l\n\n(this start a new \"login\" shell) \nromano@pern:~$ shopt -s huponexit\nromano@pern:~$ sleep 1234 &\n[1] 32202\nromano@pern:~$ exit\nlogout\n\nNow check for the sleep process: \n[romano:~] % ps augx | grep sleep\nromano   32231  0.0  0.0  16000  2408 pts/11   S+   15:23   0:00 grep sleep\n\n...not running: it has received the HUP signal and exited as requested. \n\nA: \nIf sleep can survive in this way, if it means that I can use this\n  method instead of nohup command?\n\nkill -9 is really not the way one should go. It's like shooting with a gun at the TV to turn it off. Besides the comedic component there is no advantage. Processes can't catch or ignore SIGKILL. If you don't give the process a chance to finish what it's doing and clean up, it may leave corrupted files (or other state) around and won't be able to start again. kill -9 is the last hope, when nothing else works.\n\n\nWhy sleep process can survive when I logout and terminal is closed. In\n  my mind, everything except daemon and nohup program will be killed\n  when logout.\n\nWhat in your case happens:\nThe parent process of sleep is the currently running bash shell. When you kill -9 that bash, the bash process has not the chance to send a SIGHUP to any of its child processes, because SIGKILL (which is sent by kill -9) is not catchable by the process. The sleep process continues running. sleep now became an orphan process.\nThe init (PID 1) process does a mechanism called reparenting. That means that the init process now becomes the parent of that orphaned process. init is an exception, processes can become it's child as it collects processes that lost their original parent process. Btw: A daemon (like sshd) does that when \"going in the background\".\nIf that whould not happen, the orphaned process would later (when finished) become a zombie process. This is what happens when waitpid() is not called (a responsibility of the parent process which cannot be fullfilled when when that process got killed). init calls waitpid() in an specific intervall to avoid zombie childs.\n\nA: The & starts the process in background. If you type ps -ef, you will see that parent process ID (PPID) of your sleep is your bash. Then logout and login again. The process will remain running after you logout. After you login for the second time you run ps -ef again. You will see that now the parent of your sleep process will be process with id \"1\". That is init, the parent of all processes.\n\nA: Using & will cause program to run as background. To see the program in the background use bg command , and to make it running as foreground again, run fg. \nYes, there are many ways to keep program running even the main terminal exited.\n\nA: There's two kinds of SIGHUP that can be involved here.\nFirst, because in this kind of situation, the shell will be a so called Controlling Process (a session leader shell in ownership of a controlling terminal--a pseudoterminal created by the ssh login), a terminal driver will be obligated to send SIGHUP to all members of the foreground process group of the terminal when the terminal is disconnected.\n(It will also send SIGHUP+SIGCONT to stopped backgrounded processes (orphan process groups)).\nYou've ruled such a system-sent SIGHUP out by backgrounding the process while being in an interactive shell. Such backgrounding will put the process(es) in a separate process group that won't be the foreground process group of the terminal, and so the driver won't send SIGHUP to such processes.\nBackgrounding by itself isn't the issue, but you need to background from a shell that's noninteractive (interactive shells put backgrounded processes in separate process groups) and part of the foreground process group:\n#from a ssh login shell\nbash -c 'echo $$; sleep 1000 & sleep 1000 && wait' \n#a backgrounded and a nonbackgrounded sleep, both in the foreground process group\n\nNow if you were to kill -9 the echoed shell pid from another terminal, both the sleep processes would receive SIGHUP from the terminal driver (a sigaction-registered signal handler would read the sender's pid as si_pid==0).\nSecond there's SIGHUPs sent by the shell depending on its settings (si_pid!=0). An interactive bash resends received SIGHUPs to all its foreground jobs.\nThis behavior allows you to have several interactive bashes on top of each other (like if you were to run bash from the login bash and possibly some bash instances (no & at the end) from it)\nand rest assured a SIGHUP from the first (controlling) bash gets sent down even though each controlling bash will create its own process group and so the SIGHUP sent by the terminal driver wouldn't be able to reach the descendants.  (Not all shell have this. E.g., Dash doesn't.) Bash will also resend SIGHUP to its backgrounded processes, but only if the huponexit setting is on and the job isn't disowned. None of these resends can apply if the shell was forcibly killed by SIGKILL (kill -9).\nEdit:\nJust found a very relevant answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/32786211/1084774 by gavv which has a couple more details.\n", "Q: When I am trying to restart mt postfix and nagios the following messaged is displayed in the mail.log file When i am trying to restart my postfix and nagios for sending a mail automatically about the status the foollowing message appears.\nStatus:Deffered.Connections will not be accepted from x.x.x.x because the ip is in spamhaus list[yahoo.dns.net]\n\n\nA: This is normal if you are using dynamic public IP.

Can I run ubuntu with these specifications smoothly?\n\nA: Yes, AND No.  I have run late-ish variants of Ubuntu, 12.04 and higher on computers with less than 1g of RAM, but if I recall correctly, I had difficulty performing the installation due to the low memory.  In the end, I installed the OS on a separate computer with more RAM and then moved the drive to the computer with the lesser quantity of RAM and it worked.  I would not go so far as to say it worked terribly well, but it worked.\nIn my experience Pentium 4's actually run pretty well with Ubuntu, provided they have enough RAM.  My definition of enough might not be someone else's.  In my experience, the cutoff is about 1.25gb, below which the system is annoyingly slow and prefers to have only one application loaded at a time.  My advice to you would be to see if you can add 1gb of RAM to your machine.  \nI would guess that your 512 is made up of two 256 modules.  I would advise you to take one of them out and replace it with a 1gb, thus upgrading to the minimum I outlined and spending a minimum of money.  If you can afford to purchase two such modules and expand your memory to 2gb, I would advise doing so.\nHad you listed the brand and model of your machine, I probably would have looked up a favorable price for you on Amazon.com\n\nA: I won't use the word smoothly at all, but it's surely doable. I would head towards less resources-hungry versions anyway, like xubuntu or lubuntu as said.

The system will boot?\nThank you,\n\nA: \nIs this OK to separate the partitions on 2 differents disks like that?\n\nYes, but I would not do this.\nIt is possible to prepare for a failure of a disk. If you have it like this and either of the disks dies you can not boot. It might be better to install the system on the 2nd disk and then edit the configuration of the server software to use a \"data\" partition with a size of 500Gb on disk 1. Apache, MySQL, Cups can all be told to use another location than /var/. That would make your backup plan easier: backup this one \"data\" disk makes sure you have it all safe. If the disk with data dies you take it out, put in a new one and restore your backup. \nThis data disk basically holds all you own data. MySQL database, website, VBox containers and everything else. If the disk fills up you buy a 2Tb disk, install it next to the 500Gb, move it over to the 2Tb and take the 500Gb out. Easy and quick.\nIf the system disk dies you make a new system disk and restore the settings files for each server software (and you of course have backups on the \"data\" disk of those configuration files. \nNowadays I would set a server up like this:\nSCSI5 (2,0,0)\n/data {remaining space}\n/data/configuration/ {1Gb or so}\n\nSCSI5 (2,1,0)\n/ {remaining space}\n/tmpfs {15Gb}\nswap  {35Gb}\n\nAnd change the config files to have it use /data/\nHave a look at how a GCE (Google Compute Engine) works: you get a base system and mount your own user disk into it. And that user disk holds all your own software and data. \nRegarding this specific setup:\n\nI'm trying to setup a Linux server\n\nThere are several servers you can set up: web, database, printer, file and tons more. The partition scheme should reflect what kind of server you are going to use. \nFor a SERVER 350Gb for /home/ is far too large. /home/ should have hardly anything in it and you can suffice with a mere 25Gb. \nIf this is a webserver (Apache) and database server (MySQL) will by default store its data in /var/. Depending on usage that directory can grow quickly and 30Gb might be too little. Well to me it is if you have 350Gb wasted on home.\nSame goes for a print server: CUPS will use /var/ to store all of the history of all the prints (when set up to save those). \n64Gb for /opt/ can be enough. It depends on what you are going to use. Eclipse, Tomcat, Jasperserver (a server that can create templates to create a pdf from mysql) can have it fill up quickly too.\nBoth /var/ and /opt/ would be better of getting each 150Gb from /home/.\nThe 111Gb for root is a lot too since the 2 big ones (/var/ and /opt) have their own partitions. But I guess to fill up the disk it is good enough. You could make it smaller and have /home/ on that one too. \n15 Gb for /tmp/?

I chose \"Windows 8\", pressed ENTER and it went back to the boot menu.\nI can't understand why it can't boot into Windows, because it showed that Windows is on sda2, and that was right. So I used Boot-Repair on my Ubuntu live USB, but it didn't help.  \nI installed Windows 8.1 on the partition where I installed Ubuntu, because I thought I could fix this from this Windows and boot into my 2 Windows 10s. But now when I start up my laptop I see the logo and a blank screen with blinking underline.\nNow I am using a Boot-Repair CD. Here is my boot info from the Boot-Repair program;  \nIn short: I had 2 WIndows 10, one in sda2 and I don't care about the other Windows. All I want is to get back to my Windows 10 in sda2.\n\nA: The default installation of windows 10 requires a minimum of 4 partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 (Recovery)\n\n*sda2 (Boot/efi)\n\n*sda3 (MSR)\n\n*sda4 (Windows OS, usually \"C\")\n\n\nOn the other end, linux OS requires a minimum of 2 partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 (swap)\n\n*sda2 (/)\n\n\nUsing a live Ubuntu CD or USB you can check your disk's partition with the following command:\nsudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL\n\nIf you had 2 Windows 10 installed then you should have 8 partitions for windows and at least 2 more for Linux. So a total of 10 partitions. Also if you installed another Windows 10 you might have erased some of your DATA from the original Windows 10 (the one you want to recover). Using the command mentioned earlier with a live CD of Ubuntu you should be able to have a better idea of what happened to your system. Also you will be able to access your Windows partition from Nautilus and backup any data.\nWith the information provided, I think at this point you'll have to reinstall completely your system. If you don't want to lose any DATA, boot first with a live Ubuntu CD or USB and backup all the DATA you had on your windows partition on an external Hard Drive usually located at: \n\n\"/media/[username]/Windows\"\n\nReinstall windows 10 completely, (Format and delete all partition) and then, after Windows 10 is working, install Ubuntu but on a different partition. So a normal installation of Windows 10 + ubuntu should look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 (Recovery)\n\n*sda2 (Boot/efi)\n\n*sda3 (MSR)\n\n*sda4 (Windows)\n\n*sda5 (swap)\n\n*sda6 (Ubuntu)\n\n\nPlease feel free to ask me more questions today, I'll gladly help.

Anyone have any thoughts why?\n\nA: This issue has got nothing to do with dual booting, as long as you can boot Ubuntu and Windows.\nThe problem might have been occurring because the graphics card was not configured properly.\nWhen you have NVIDIA graphics (especially on notebooks with Optimus) it is recommended to install the latest current stable drivers from the NVIDIA long-lived branch. - More information about how to do this you will find in the Q+A : How do I install NVIDIA GPU drivers properly ?\nTo avoid these kind of issues when installing Ubuntu : add the nouveau.modeset=0 parameter (in case of NVIDIA graphics) to the end of the GRUB linux line when booting from install media.\n", "Q: very basic question about ppa What is a ppa?

Suppose you have some embedded board with ethernet plugged into the ethernet port on your laptop. You know nothing about it's network configuration (yet).  You know it boots, but it is headless and only has an ethernet port.  It does NOT have an ip address (yet).\nHow do you discover the MAC address of the device?  \nI've looked at arp, arping, arp-scan, arpwatch. The only thing I've found is using tshark and combing through the spew manually.\n\nA: Running plain tshark or tcpdump produces messy output, because all the traffic originating from your machine gets logged too.\nTry\ntcpdump -i eth0 -lenq 'ether src not <your_mac>'\n\n\n*\n\n*-e captures the ethernet frame too\n\n*-l flushes stdout buffer immediately.\n\n*-n don't resolve hostnames\n\n*-q be more quiet.\n\n*replace <your_mac> by the MAC address of your local interface as found with e.g ip addr show.\n\n*obviously replace eth0 with the correct interface. If you're on Windows, use tshark -D to list all interfaces.\n\n*(Edit) On Linux you may use tcpdump instead of installing tshark which needs installation of the whole wireshark package. tcpdump should be pre-installed on Ubuntu (it's in the meta-package ubuntu-standard).\n\nAlternative: If you want source MAC addresses as output only, do (inspired and shamelessly adapted by OPs comment below)\nETH=eth0;MAC=$(cat /sys/class/net/$ETH/address); tcpdump -lenq -i $ETH \"ether src not $MAC\" | awk '{print $2}'\n\nBest to start the capture without a link and then plug the cable in.\nI don't think there is a way around sniffing traffic. The reason ARP fails, is that the device has no IP address and won't answer to ARP requests.\nAnother possible solution would be to connect the device to a managed switch and read out the MAC address table, but I feel that's not an option for you.\nIn any case, to be detectable, the device needs to send out some sort of Ethernet traffic. If you're lucky it sends a DHCP/Bootp discover which you can sniff.\n(Edit) Why does the host not hold a MAC table like a switch does? Well, it doesn't need to, because it is not a switch. Unlike a switch the decision which interface puts out an Ethernet frame is made beforehand according to the routing table. The IP packet is wrapped in an appropriate frame after ARP lookup.\nSure, you can turn your machine into a proper L2 switch. You may create a bridge between multiple physical interfaces. I fiddled around with this a bit, and as it turns out you can get a nice MAC table that way!\n\n*\n\n*Install bridge-utils from the repository.\n\n\n*Create a new Ethernet bridge in /etc/network/interfaces\n auto br0\n iface br0 inet static # dhcp goes as well\n  address ...\n  network ...\n  bridge_ports eth0\n  up /sbin/brctl setageing br0 300\n  up /sbin/brctl stp br0 0\n\nThis defines a \"bridge\" (there's really no bridge - just one interface) without spanning-tree stp br0 off.

Please help, because I love ubuntu, but it's very sad for me that I can't sync my phone with PC. I don't want to return to Win !!! \n\nA: It is sad, but this is actually Apple's doing. Ubuntu has been able to sync to iDevices for quite some time, via libimobiledevice. However, most new versions of iOS use a new database that doesn't work with Linux. (According to tech support, that was intentional on Apple's part.)\nAssuming you have libimobiledevice installed, you can check if your Apple device is compatible. Plug it into your computer, and then run the following in the Terminal.\n$ ideviceinfo -q com.apple.mobile.iTunes -k DBVersion\n\nIf that reports a version greater than 4, unfortunately, iTunes is your only option. [That or taking your iDevice out to a firing range for some target practice and getting an Android. That works too.]\n\nWorkaround: I am able to \"sync\" music with my iPod Touch using Google Play Music. It's actually pretty slick, and less annoying than iTunes ever was - no cords or tethering required!\nInstall the free Google Play Music app on your iDevice and pair it with your Google account. Then install Google Music Manager on your Ubuntu computer and have it monitor your music folder. It will upload all of your music to the cloud (which stores up to 50,000 songs for free). \nYou can play all your music, even Ogg Vorbis, via the internet on your iDevice with the app, and you can select individual tracks to store offline on the mobile device. \nSide benefits: you can play your entire music library online with a web browser (play.google.com/music) you can buy tracks directly from Google Play, and the paid version works just like Spotify (stream anything). Plus, it's a handy backup for your music in case your computer ever dies. \nYou'll never need Apple Music or iTunes again. :P\n", "Q: how can we prevent ttf-mscorefonts-installer to be installed?

I learnt about 'xrandr' and decided to add a new mode as directed here.\nNow, the real issue is that the resolution has changed to 1280x1024 but there is an apparent shift in the screen position - horizontally towards right about an offset of 1.25 inches and vertically towards up about an offset of 0.125 inches - in ubuntu alone. My Windows PC is just fine. Tried out --auto and --pos options of xrandr but to no avail. I have a feeling I'm missing some feature of xrandr here.\nHow can I get it back to normal at (0,0) by shifting the position a bit down vertically and a bit left horizontally. Now my screen is positioned at an approximate (100,15)?\nUpdates :\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried reverting back to earlier resolution of 1024x768. Then, the screen is back to normal. I mean it is now positioned at (0,0).\n\n*I tried deleting the created new mode using xrandr and creating a fresh new mode. Still it has got the shift to the same degree as before.\n\nA: Just came across this and tried the auto-adjust/auto-configure button on my DELL monitor. It appeared to have solved the issue. But when I switched to my Windows 7 PC (I use a KVM switch to toggle between my PCs), I saw that it had affected the positioning there.\nSo, I played around with Screen Resolution settings in my Windows 7 PC and changed the refresh rate from the default 60Hz to 75 Hz. And Voila! It positioned itself back to normal! Having read in this post that it recurs at startup everytime, I tried restarting the system as well as shutting down and turning it on back again too. I can confirm that it is back to normal now.\nThis has fixed the issue but for the sake of my curiosity I would love to know the mechanics behind this. It would be helpful if someone explained what is the exact reason behind this behavior. It doesn't appear as something that has got to do with xrandr afterall!\n", "Q: Bash Script - How can I get the size of directories in .txt file and save them into other file? I started a few weeks with Linux bash programming, but I'm struggling with a problem: How can I get the size of multiple directories (path saved on a .txt file) and then, write into another file, the directory path, followed by size and the total size occupied by that directories.\nI already tried this, but I'm not sure:\ntotsize=0\nwhile read -r diretory; do\n   size=$(du -ch \"$directory\")\n   echo \"$diretory size: $size\" > \"$homedir/$filename2\"\n   $totsize += $(du -c \"$homedir/$diretorio\")\ndone < \"$homedir/diretories.txt\"\nsudo echo \"total size: $totsize\" >> \"$homedir/$filename2\"\n\nThanks in advance (and sorry for bad english)\n\nA: When dealing with files or directories by their name, I highly recommend to deal with them separated by the nullbyte character, not by a newline. Because officially a filename can contain a newline. So you should not make a list of the directories separated by a newline.\nAnyway, when you have this list you can just use this:\ndu -sch --files0-from=dirs.txt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-s is like -d0 and will only summarize a total for each argument.\n\n*-c calculates a grand total.\n\n*-h does that all in human readable format.\n\n*--files0-from=dirs.txt reads the filenames/directorynames from the given file terminated by nullbyte.\n\n\n\nWith your list, it whould look like (but with the pitfall of filenames with newlines in it):\ntr '\\n' '\\0' <dirs.txt | du -sch --files0-from=-\n\n\nA: You can get size of directories with du command like this:\ndu -h -d 1 \"path to parent directory\"\n\n-d: the depth of subdirectories\n\nA: Use find combined with du and redirect to file with >\nsudo find /path/to/topDir -maxdepth 1 -type d  -exec du -sh {} \\;  > output.txt\n\nExample:\nxieerqi:$ sudo find Desktop -maxdepth 1 -type d  -exec du -sh {} \\; > outputFile1.txt                                                            \n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \n\nxieerqi:$ cat outputFile1.txt                                                                                                                    \n2.7G    Desktop\n69M Desktop/linux-kernel-4.1.0\n1.1M    Desktop/DOCS\n6.8M    Desktop/The comments that became a reporter’s death sentence | New York Post_files\n4.0K    Desktop/newdir\n6.7M    Desktop/IMAGES\n12M Desktop/TIRES\n504K    Desktop/MSU-TEMPLATES\n341M    Desktop/PDFS\n19M Desktop/java\n\nTo have this command give disk usage for specific directories from list , what you can do is combine cat and xargs with the command above. For example,\n cat dirList.txt | xargs -I dir sudo find dir -maxdepth 0 -type d  -exec du -sh {} \\; \n\nSome directories of which you're not an owner require sudo access to list their disk usage, hence combine that with sudo sh -c.

Right now I do not need Windows, but I don't want to get rid of it, in case I need it in the future.\nThe problem is that I could not get the Grub menu to show up. I disabled Secure Boot, fast Boot and installed Kubuntu three times through a Live USB. The installation process is smooth. I create the partitions manually (/home, / and swap) and install normally after that. The problem is that the computer always boots into Windows, without showing the GRUB menu.\nI tried the boot-repair through the live USB and still doesn't work. I got the following link:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/12782400\n\nA: In the UEFI / Bios you can configure which bootloader should be loaded first by the UEFI. Maybe you should check if this is configured correctly. It needs to be set to load GRUB first, not the Windows Bootloader.\nIn my UEFI setup there is a tab named \"Boot\" where an option \"Boot device priority\" can be found. Please make sure that the entry \"ubuntu [...]\" is on top of that list, not \"Windows [...]\"\n\nA: Please write what entries are in your boot device priority list. \nProbably there's no entry you need because something is wrong with the Ubuntu boot partition. If there's really no Ubuntu entry then check from windows or from Ubuntu liveCD with GParted if there is /dev/sda1 partition in fat32 with boot-flag.

When I download updates for my nvidia geforce 8800gt, the screen turns black and the cursor is blinking at the top left corner. I am forced to reinstall ubuntu. Is it possible to run terminal before I boot ubuntu?\n\nA: There is something known as root recovery shell. You can access it through grub boot menu -> Advanced options for Ubuntu -> select one that says (recovery mode). You will have several options there, choose root shell. The filesystem in root shell is mounted read-only, so you will need to remount it with read write permissions with mount / -o remount,rw \nAnother small hack is to press e on the boot menu and add init=/bin/bash line , but I wouldn't recomment it.\n", "Q: Is there any data loss during dual boot? I am currently using ubuntu on my laptop......Now I  want to dual boot windows alongside ubuntu....I want to ask will I be loosing data that is currently present in ubuntu if I dual boot windows\n\nA: It is strongly recommended to first install the Windows OS and then afterwards install Ubuntu.\nBut this means that you will have to wipe your whole disk and therefore all your data will be lost.  \nYou can backup your /home folder to another disk and restore the content into your new Ubuntu installation.  \nFor this purpose the easiest way is to do it with deja-dup which is included in Ubuntu.\nAnother alternative could be, that you copy the data you want to keep manually to another drive.\n\nA: Fist of all. You cannot \"dual boot\" in the sense that two operating systems are running at the same time. You can only \"dual boot\" in the sense that you have the option to boot either.\nSecondly: You should specify what you are attempting to do. I'll try to cover the cases that come to mind:\nInstallation\nIf you have data on a partition (thus on a disk) and you install an operating system (windows or Linux) or parts of it onto this partition, then the partition gets (in most cases) formatted and the data on it gets lost, consequentially.\nIn contrast what was written in another answer: I am pretty sure that installing Windows does not wipe the entire drive, but only - as I mentioned - the partition it is installed in. That the entire disk would be wiped would (obviously) only be the case if partition would span the entire disk. But then you would need another disk for the second operating system.\nAfter installation: Running one system after the other\nShutting down before restarting\nIf you shut down one operating system properly it does not effect anything on the other operating system.\nHibernation (suspend to disk) before restarting\nIf you are in Windows and hibernate (suspend to disk) and then boot into Ubuntu you may experience data loss. Thus you should disable fast startup in Windows settings: http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Linux-and-Windows-8-Fast-Startup-puts-data-at-risk-1780640.html\nThe same goes for the scenario when you are in Ubuntu, hibernate and go into Windows: https://superuser.com/a/136814\nSuspend to RAM before restarting\nI don't think it is possible to change the operating system if you suspend to RAM.\n", "Q: how to change dota 2 Icon?

I understand that the partitions are OK because it comes from another ubuntu.\nBackup is not an option, as this is my biggest HDD, and I dont have enought space to save all the data.\nThanks!\n\nA: No worries. Ubuntu will not try to reformat any disk plugged in.

In the coming days I will be doing some minor changes in the hostapd codebase and testing it around. This may affect the way hostapd works and impact the underlying Wi-Fi operations and I don't want my Wi-Fi connection in Ubuntu to be affected. Would anyone recommend how should I go about working with hostpd. Is there any safe method through which I can play around hostapd code base without my Wi-Fi connection getting affected. Any inputs would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Why would you make changes in the codebase of hostapd? Hostapd is maintained very well and works pretty good. Hostapd is an application to set up a software AP as you obviously know. It only affects the network adapter you specify in the configuration file of hostapd and nothing else. Only when you activate hostapd this comes into play.\nBasically you can change whatever you want and if hostapd malfunctions just stop it and everything is as it was before. I recommend you to start and stop hostapd from the terminal during your experiments.\nOf course you need to use it with a second network adapter and not the one you are using for your regular network connection.\n", "Q: Can't install steam on ubuntu 14, 64 bit I just replaced my old win vista today with Ubuntu, a fresh install.

I'm connected to router with ethernet cable and received the download failure message on 3 separate days with ping check at 50 or close.  Today the download went thru fine after checking ping at 47. Current problem solved but still puzzled why it went ok with a slightly lower ping and with identical configuration. I'm a newby and don't know how to bring up the error log, by the way.\n\nA: Are you using a wired connection to access the internet or using Wi-Fi? Just because your internet connection seems to \"work fine\" doesn't mean it does. \nYou might be losing some package which could result in the error you are getting. If you are using Wi-Fi, try again with an ethernet cable. If you're already using a cable, an easy way to determine if you are losing package is to run a ping command and leave it running for a while.\nping google.com\n\nAfter running this command for a while you'll know if you are losing package. Might be a problem with your internet connection. There isn't enough detail in your questions to help you. Can you post the compete error message?\nitSp4x\n", "Q: How do I replace Windows 7 Ultimate with Kubuntu without loosing my files in partition D wich is NTFS? I want to replace my Windows 7 Ultimate with Kubuntu. I have a big D partition that is hard to backup and I want to install kubuntu without loosing the partition and still be accesible in kubuntu. The partition is NTFS.\n\nA: As long as you do not delete your \"D\" partition you won't lose the DATA on it. Try creating different partitions where you can install Kubuntu. You will need 2 partitions to install kubuntu. 1 for swap and 1 for system file. At the end you should have at least 3 partition (2 for Kubuntu and 1 for your \"D\") if you haven't deleted your windows partition. \nIf you can open the partition tool in windows or in linux and take a screenshot/picture it would really help. I would be able to tell you which partiton you can and cannot delete. Linux can access ntfs just fine so you won't need to change anything on your \"D\" in order to access it from Kubuntu.\nitSp4x\n\nA: I installed Ubuntu 15.10 in drive D:. Drive C:  contains Windows 8.1 . My Laptop has 4GB ram so i didn't even create partition for swap. I am running Ubuntu now and ram consumption is 1.2 GB. Most of the time it takes only 800 MB. So no need for swap memory.\nThus my point is if your ram is 4GB or more , you can install Kubuntu in drive C: without creating swap partition and without any loss of data from other partitions.\n", "Q: Kill 2 other process with .sh Script I have a radio.sh file. I start it from Java with:\nProcess ls=null;\nBufferedReader input=null;\nString line=null; \ntry {\n    ls= Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{\"/bin/bash\", \"/home/djeki22/Dokumente/radio.sh\"});\n    input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(ls.getInputStream()));\n\n    } catch (IOException e1) {\n        e1.printStackTrace();  \n        System.exit(1);\n      }\n\nin the radio.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrtl_fm -f 103.78M:103.82M:25K -M wbfm -s 159K -r 48K -l 2 -E deemp -F 9 - | aplay -r 48k -f S16_LE\n\nI would like to kill this process because I want to change the frequency. I'd like to run a new script radio1.sh with the same script, but with other frequency.\nI can kill rtl_fm and aplay with killall rtl_fm and killall aplay, but rtl_fm isn't 100% killed. But I cannot hear anything. If I start java and start this radio.sh, I cannot hear anything. It's not working.\nIf I start radio.sh in a terminal, it tells me that it cant open the device. I think the device is in use.\nHow can I kill this process with a script?\n\nA: The best way to do it is to have the process (rtl_fm) write it's own PID to a PID file, then use the contents of that file to kill the process.\nHowever, since rtl_fm does not have a way to write it's PID to a file, we can use a workaround.\n#!/bin/bash\nRTL_PID=`ps -e | grep rtl_f[m] | awk '{print $1}'`\nkill ${RTL_PID}\n\nFirst, we set a variable RTL_PID with the processes PID.  We get this by listing all processes, looking for rtl_fm.  The [m] is a trick that keeps grep rtl_fm from showing up in the list of processes.  Finally, take the line output and get the first field from it, which is the PID.\nNote that this will send a TERM signal to the process.  If that doesn't work and you need to send a KILL, add a -9, e.g. kill -9 ${RTL_PID}.\n", "Q: Cannot get mount command in Terminal I tried using mount command in Terminal  and it did not provide any information, only:-\n<david@david-Original ~>$ mount\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\nudev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,relatime,size=1539644k,nr_inodes=211868,mode=755)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000)\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,size=310112k,mode=755)\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\nsecurityfs on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\ntmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\ntmpfs on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=5120k)\ntmpfs on /sys/fs/cgroup type tmpfs (rw,mode=755)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,xattr,release_agent=/lib/systemd/systemd-cgroups-agent,name=systemd)\npstore on /sys/fs/pstore type pstore (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hugetlb,release_agent=/run/cgmanager/agents/cgm-release-agent.hugetlb)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,freezer)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls,net_prio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,net_cls,net_prio)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpuset,clone_children)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpu,cpuacct)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,perf_event,release_agent=/run/cgmanager/agents/cgm-release-agent.perf_event)\n19:33:29\nory)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,blkio)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/devices type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,devices)\nsystemd-1 on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=36,pgrp=1,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct)\ndebugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,relatime)\nhugetlbfs on /dev/hugepages type hugetlbfs (rw,relatime)\nmqueue on /dev/mqueue type mqueue (rw,relatime)\nfusectl on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw,relatime)\n/dev/sda1 on /boot type ext2 (rw,relatime)\ncgmfs on /run/cgmanager/fs type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=100k,mode=755)\ntmpfs on /run/user/1000 type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=310112k,mode=700,uid=1000,gid=1000)\ngvfsd-fuse on /run/user/1000/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1000,group_id=1000)\n/dev/sdb1 on /media/david/My Passport type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,showexec,utf8,flush,errors=remount-ro,uhelper=udisks2)\n/dev/sdb6 on /media/david/a8113041-28ca-4898-b36f-33c9c0f492f4 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,data=ordered,uhelper=udisks2)\n\n<david@david-Original ~>$ \n\n****** what am I doing wrong  I have at least one hard disk and one usb external disk\n\nA: There is nothing wrong.

This mechanism is similar to pathname  expansion,  but  the\n   filenames generated need not exist. \n...\nPathname Expansion\n   After  word  splitting,  unless  the -f option has been set, bash scans\n   each word for the characters *, ?, and [.  If one of  these  characters\n   appears,  then  the word is regarded as a pattern, and replaced with an\n   alphabetically sorted list  of  filenames  matching  the  pattern  (see\n   Pattern  Matching  below). If no matching filenames are found, and the\n   shell option nullglob is not enabled, the word is left  unchanged.\n...\nPattern Matching\n\n   Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern\n   characters described below, matches itself.  ...\n\n   The special pattern characters have the following meanings:\n\n   ...\n          [...]  Matches  any  one  of the enclosed characters.  A pair of\n                 characters  separated  by  a  hyphen  denotes   a   range\n                 expression;  any  character  that falls between those two\n                 characters,  inclusive,  using   the   current   locale's\n                 collating sequence and character set, is matched.\n\nfile[1-3] expands into files named file1, file2, file3. Filename expansion happens only if matching files exist. If not, the pattern is left as-is. Therefore, with files named file1, file2, file3, file[1-3] expands to file1 file2 file3. Without these files, it doesn't expand, and remains as file[1-3]. With {...}, the filenames don't have to exist, so file{1..3} expands to file1 file2 file3 irrespective of the files being present or absent.\n", "Q: Where can I find a driver for an Epson XP-424?

I would like to buy big internal hard drive - bigger than 2tb, maybe 4tb.\nAnd I want to partition it with old fashioned fdisk.\nBy doing it, I want to make two partitions, each less than 2tb.\nAfter that I want to format partitions with ext3.\nI don't want to use any modern partition tools - like gparted, gdisk, etc.\nIs it possible to divide 4tb disk onto two partions of 2tb each using fdisk?\nIf it is, would they be reliable after that?\n\n\n*\n\n*if the only possible way is to use gparted or the like, then I would better buy 2tb disk and partition it with fdisk.\n\n\nThe reason, I am asking that, is that I don't trust gparted. I think, big partitions made by gparted could be unreliable. And I don't trust assurances that they are reliable. Of course, some of them are happy with them. As is always the case with something. But I always looking for negative, not positive information. I have very little experience with big drives, but I have already an impression: they are unreliable.\nMy WD drives never crushed before. As soon as I've bought WD 4tb and formatted it with gparted, it worked for about two years, and now it's completely heap of junk. And I have intuitive feeling, that the fault lies in gparted and gpt. I don't want to risk to use them any more.\n\nA: Well before I tell you the reasons why it isn't possible for gparted to destroy your HDD, I'll tell you that fdisk can't deal with partitions larger than 2TB, so you should be able to partition it with 2x2TB partitions.  But I wouldn't recommend it.\nThe answer you're looking for is: \"Yes, you can do that, but be careful\"\nThe answer that other people will want (or want to give) is that gparted really can't destroy a disk like that.  You can do whatever you want to a hard disk with formatting and partitioning and what have you (as long as you don't do anything insane like writing 10,000 TB to it a day *coughcoughGooglecough*) and it can always be reformatted.  Gparted is the way to go for anything modern.  It will work with most everything out there (if it's post-War On Terrorism) and is easier to work with.  It won't hurt to use fdisk, but just make sure you be careful.  To stay on the safe side, I would stay under 1.5TB per partition rather than trying to ride the line, if you're set on using fdisk.\nThe answer that I want to give is: \"Use gparted.

All I basically wanted to do was saying if there are between 1-20 packages show this warning, if 21-infinity show critical and so on, but I could not just do [ -gt 1 ] or even [20-10000]\nWhen applying these ranges the script would run kind of irregularly and warn when it was meant to be critical, etc. I think I gathered that ranges are not really possible here, I am just wondering why it worked for the example given above but not for me. Also, Is it in any way possible to include conditions within case? \nIn the end I managed to do a fully working script but I had to create if conditions and pass them to case. Just wondering if there was an easier way to do this without having to do that. \nBelow is more or less what I was trying to do.

[1-85] does not mean the numbers 1 to 85, but the digits from 1 to 8, and 5, ... which are just the digits from 1 to 8.

How can we isolate wifi clients the same way \"Client Isolation\" does in some access points? Is there any way we can combine iptables with hostapd to apply some firewall rules between wifi clients?\n\nA: Create an iptables rule on input and output that allows the source address range to talk to the router/default gateway, additional rules for any servers or other resources on that subnet.\nCreate a final rule that drops packets between the source address range and the source address range.\niptables -A INPUT -i $WIFI -o $WIFI -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.1.1 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i $WIFI -o $WIFI -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d $SOMESERVERIP -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i $WIFI -o $WIFI -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d $SOMEOTHERSERVERIP -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i $WIFI -o $WIFI -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP\n\nThe basics of this chain of events is:\n\n\n*\n\n*if it's in the subnet and it's talking to the gateway, accept it\n\n*If it's in the subnet and it's talking to a server, accept it\n\n*Rule 2 repeats until you run out of acceptable servers\n\n*If it's in the subnet and it's talking to anything else in the subnet, drop it\n\n\nA: At this time, iptables rules have no effect on the packets forwarded directly by the wifi interface, according to this.\nGood news is that Hostapd 2.9 has a an option called ap_isolate that does exactly what you described. You can read about it here.\nOnce you set that flag, all packets from devices on the access point network will be dropped by the access point.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 freezing completely So I dual boot windows 10 and ubuntu 15.04 and whenever I boot up Ubuntu, after around 15 minutes or so, it will just freeze and i'll be able to hear the sounds and stuff but after another minutes it completely freezes and I can't switch through tty or anything and I have to restart my computer and just repeat the same thing over again.

Than I did  sudo apt-cache show dconf-tools and found in the output that libdconf0 (<< 0.7.3-2) is causing problems, as libdconf1 is 0.20.0-1 which seems to be newer.\nAssuming that on 14.04 libconfd0 is not used anymore this information is obsolete for the compiling ibus.\nHow can I solve this?\nEdit 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*installed dconf-tools, dconf-cli, dconf-editor as dconf package is not present in the packages.\n\n*checked the /etc directory there is dconf related stuff there\n\n*checked ibus/configure mechanism for dconf:\nif test x\"$enable_dconf\" = x\"yes\"; then\n    # check dconf\n    PKG_CHECK_MODULES(DCONF,\n        [dconf >= 0.7.5],\n    )\n    PKG_CHECK_EXISTS([dconf >= 0.13.4],\n        [AC_DEFINE(DCONF_0_13_4, TRUE, [dconf is 0.13.4 or later])],\n        [])\n    # check glib-compile-schemas\n    GLIB_GSETTINGS\n    enable_dconf=\"yes (enabled, use --disable-dconf to disable)\"\nfi\n\nEdit 2:\nlibdconf0 was misleading\n\nA: For proper IntelliJ integration I had to compile iBus 1.5.11 from source.\nTo succeed on this I had to install libdconf-dev and libnotify-dev, which libs where not properly mentioned by to original ibus maintainer so I suggested him to add this information for a successful build process description on Debian based systems.\nsudo apt-get install libdconf-dev libnotify-dev\n\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 LTS crashes when clicking on launcher icon I experience reproducible crashes of Ubuntu-14.04 LTS, when clicking on the launcher icon of an application, which is already opened with more than one window.

It is running Kubuntu 15.04 and I installed X11vnc by this description:\nVNC/Servers - Have x11vnc start automatically via systemd in any environment (Vivid+)\nAfter a reboot the service is enabled and active (I think?), but I can not connect from the laptop using UltraVNC.\nOnly when I run\nx11vnc -auth guess -forever -loop -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth /home/USERNAME/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5900 -shared\n\nin a terminal I can connect to the server with UltraVNC.\nI don´t want to issue this command everytime I want to the server. I want to be able to connect to server after a reboot without doing anything at the server.\nAny ideas what goes wrong?\n\nA: Sounds like you didn't configure x11vnc as a system service, so that it's automatically started when the system boots.  I just did the same thing you're trying to do, and it works.  Execute the following and it should resolve your problem.\nStep 1: Set a password specific to your username that you'll use to login to x11vnc from a remote system.  \nx11vnc -storepasswd\n\nEnter a password and store the file to: /home/USERNAME/.vnc/passwd\nNote: make sure to replace USERNAME with your actual username.\nStep 2: Configure the 'x11vnc.service' file so that vnc will be automatically started when the system boots up.  You can use any text editor, but you'll need sudo access to edit the file.  I'm using nano in the example here.\nsudo nano /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service\n\nCopy and paste the following lines into nano.\n[Unit]\nDescription=Start x11vnc at startup.\nAfter=multi-user.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -auth guess -forever -loop -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth /home/USERNAME/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5900 -shared\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nExit and save the file by pressing 'Ctrl-X', then type 'Y' and press 'Enter'.  Again, make sure you replace USERNAME with your actual username.\nStep 3: Reload the services so your computer knows about the x11vnc service that you just configured in step 2 above.  And enable the x11vnc service.\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl enable x11vnc.service\n\nStep 4: Start the x11vnc service.\nsudo systemctl start x11vnc\n\nStep 5: Celebrate!  :-)\nConclusion\nFollowing these steps should startup x11vnc and configure your system so that systemd, the system and service manager, will start x11vnc automatically every time the computer boots up.  \nReferences: I derived this answer from Ubuntu's documentation on VNC/Servers.  Specifically, I referenced the sections titled \"x11vnc\" and \"Have x11vnc start automatically via systemd in any environment (Vivid+)\"  .The second section I reference pertains to Ubuntu Vivid Vervet 15.04.  If you're running a different version of a Debian linux distro, you'll need to reference the correct section from Ubuntu's VNC/Server page.\n\nA: Adding to what MikeyE posted. I followed effectively the same steps above but it would still not function. It needs two additions.\n\n*\n\n*x11vnc will NOT work if it is run as root. This will occur via systemctl if you do not set a user/group. Under the [Service] field add the following:\nUser=<USERNAME>\nGroup=<USERNAME>\n\nDoing this and restarting a x11vnc will generate a new error (which is fixed via what I describe in #2.\n\n\n*A new error is displayed after doing the above. You now need a -display (or setting it via EXPORT).\nTo see if this is your problem EXPORT DISPLAY=:0 prior to starting the service as MikeyE describes. After typing the command 'EXPORT DISPLAY=:0' then sudo systemctl restart x11vnc. It now worked for me.\nYou will need a permanent way to set DISPLAY as the EXPORT method described above is lost on reboot. The above modifications to MikeyE's post allowed me to login to my Ubuntu installs.\n", "Q: How to keep Firefox usable without ever closing tabs manually? When using Firefox on her computer, my wife opens a new tab when starting a new search, and opens links in a new tab when she may want to use the linking page later.\nHowever she never closes tabs, effectively using them instead of bookmarks, which causes memory usage to keep growing, then swap use to keep increasing as tab count goes into the hundreds. Later as memory usage becomes too high it is no longer possible to hibernate, and we eventually reach a state where the whole computer becomes unusable (for instance bringing Thunderbird to front and clicking on a mail will take several minutes during which the whole computer is unresponsive). At that point we need to either close firefox entirely (which may take up to ten minutes and may lose unsaved data) or reboot (same).\nI added memory to her laptop (now 2G in total - it's an old model, that's the highest capacity I could find that was compatible) but it just means she is now able to open more tabs before things start breaking.\nMy question: is there a way to extend or modify Firefox in a way to let her follow this usage pattern without memory usage exploding? I imagine merging the concepts of tabs and bookmarks, e.g. so that tabs that have not been opened for several days be automatically bookmarked and closed (going into the filesystem where it won't take precious resources).\nIdeally, some pages such as the GMail web interface and currently playing YouTube videos (they can be recognised by the initial \"▶\") should never be auto-closed.\n\nA: This extension might be what I'm looking for: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-sweeper/\n\nA: As someone who has the same kind of net usage, where I just keep tabs that I'm busy with open until done with their topic, I would recommend using UnloadTab.\nIt will unload the tab from memory after a few minutes (that one can set) while it stays 'open' - a tab can also be unloaded manually. You can also exclude some address from being unloaded and pinned tabs are also never unloaded.\n\nA: It would be better to \"educate\" your wife, since this seems to be a problem. The max tabs extension allows you to set a maximum number of tabs and display a warning when trying to create more: https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/max-tabs/\nGo to Add-ons > Extensions and click on preference to set the limit.\n\nA: I also open a lot of tabs - to the point that Firefox becomes unstable (and don't like Chrome - which seems to do the unloading thing by itself without any add-on). Although the maximum was 100, usually not more than 30-40.\nBut - I always close the tabs as well when I'm finished. \nI use the tabmix session save/restore to save a collection of tabs usually on a certain topic. Then I close them all. And be fresh to start again. I would never ever tolerate such a slow computer. \nHopefully sometimes i get back, restore the session, finish the research and delete all tabs and the session. \nYou could try to implement this. Plus an unload add on - to speed things up at the 50-100 mark. \n\nA: The OneTab Add On is nice. You press a button and it closes all your tabs and creates a persistent new tab with links to all the urls of the tabs you closed so you can open them again later.\n", "Q: Using Expect in Bash to set the inital \"postgres\" user password?

This would allow you to upgrade or service a VIOS without exposure.  I would never run on one VIOS as they sometimes do go down from hardware and software issues.

If both cards have that same module, how can I use the alsa-base.conf to specify that I want to use the PCH card by default?\n\nA: alsa.opensrc.org has a short section which describes a scenario similar to this problem.\n\nIf you have more that one sound cards which use the same modules, you may want to define the card order. This can be done by specifying index and ID options to the module being loaded. For example,\noptions snd-usb-audio index=1,2 vid=0x0ccd,0x0d8c pid=0x0028,0x000c\nThis will define 2 usb sound cards, the first one at index=1, vid=0x0ccd and pid=0x0028; the second one at index=2, vid=0x0d8c and pid=0x000c. The vid and pid here were discovered using lsusb.\n\nNeither soundcard is a USB device, so you can't get hold of the module fields with lsusb, however that same article suggests using modinfo to get a list of parameters for that module:\nmodinfo -p snd_hda_intel\nindex:Index value for Intel HD audio interface.

I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 with GNOME 3.16.\nInformation Update:\nI have noticed that when running sudo rkhunter --nocolor --update the output is all green.\n\nA: The problem is that you are setting the command to be in green but are not closing the color escape code. Therefore, all subsequent lines, including the output of any commands which do not have their own formatting applied, are shown in that color. As a workaround (source), you could trap printing the close code to the DEBUG signal. Add this line to your ~/bashrc\ntrap 'printf \"\\e[0m\" \"$_\"' DEBUG\n\nThat will print \\e[0m (which will close the open color code). Because it is trapped to the DEBUG signal, it will be executed before any command you run. So, between hitting Enter and the command actually running. As explained in man bash:\n\nIf a sigspec is DEBUG, the command arg is executed before every simple command, for  command,  case  command,\n        select  command,  every  arithmetic  for command, and before the\n        first command executes in a shell function  (see  SHELL  GRAMMAR\n        above).  \n\n", "Q: can't get wireless up on corporate network I'm relatively new to linux/ubuntu.

I want to copy files from the Mac HD to an internal ext4 drive mounted in the Ubuntu 14.04 machine. The Mac is running share as FTP and SMB. I can connect to the Mac and navigate to the folders / files. I can copy individual files but if I try to copy folders I get an error in Ubuntu \"Error while copying XXX\", and under 'show more details' it just says \"is a directory\".\nHow can I copy whole directories and subdirectories? I think that I should be able to do this in the GUI and not resort to command line, its seems a fairly obvious and simple thing that the system should be able to do.\nThanks for any help.\nT.\n\nA: Sorry, maybe I am sidetracking, but... I have never been able to reliably configure Samba :) FTP is insecure and very slow, so you should avoid it entirely.\nThe best way to connect two computers, in my opinion, is SSH.\nSSH does have a mode that is called SFTP, which allows you to interact with files in a very natural way. In linux, most of the file managers embed an stfp protocol, so you can interact with such a service by typing sftp://remote-username@remote-ip-address/\nTo connect to your Mac, you will need to enable the SFTP server. I found a few (old) guides, I can't test them now, but you should get the idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/29/start-an-ftp-or-sftp-server-in-mac-os-x-lion/\n\n*http://www.maciverse.com/how-to-turn-on-your-macs-sftp.html\nIf you want to access Linux from the Mac, you will need to configure the ssh server first. Macs don't have a built-in client for SFTP but you can easily install a tool like Cyberduck. Or if you want to get fancy, you can install MacFuse, which will enable to to mount a remote SFTP folder and manage it via finder.\n\nA: I would recommend installing the ssh service on the Ubuntu box and then on your Mac, you can either use Cyberduck (or some other SFTP client) to transfer files, or even better, fire up Terminal on your Mac, navigate to the directory containing the files you want to copy and use scp to copy the files to the desired folder on the Ubuntu box as such:\nscp -r path_to_files_to_copy user@ubuntuserverIP:path_to_external_drive\n\n\nA: SMB is Windows Share which means that you probably have to comply with the Windows file name restrictions, even if both ends don't have these restrictions.\nAn easy solution should be to tar these files up (or use 7zip if you want compression), to send them over the network, and then to extract them again. Another advantage of 7zip over tar is that you can you can split the archives up into several junks, so you can start transmitting before everything is packed, and you only have to resend part of it, if the transmission fails (SMB will probably fail, it's not very stable).\nWhen naming the archive, don't use any of these characters: \\ (backslash) : (colon) * (asterisk) ?

I'm trying to enter a tab character in Firefox/Chrome text boxes without having to copy-paste from Emacs. The combination Ctrl+Shift+U then 0009 does not work. In fact, it does not seem to work for most \"control\" characters. However, it works for pretty much any printable character including non-ASCII. This is really bizarre.

The reason it was working as root and not my regular user was because the environment variables GTK_IM_MODULE and QT_IM_MODULE were being forced to xim for all regular users, regardless of runs of im-config. The only module I have installed under Lubuntu is ibus, so I'm not surprised by this strange behavior. A few articles on the net brought those variables to my attention so I started debugging around them. When I noticed they were being set to xim persistently, I decided to force them to ibus under /etc/environment. You have the less aggressive option of setting them in .bashrc or some equivalent. Regardless, this will restore full Ctrl+Shift+U functionality.\n", "Q: Remotely access Linux from Windows computers I have an interesting situation. I work for a company that sells medical equipment. We work in many hospitals as a 3rd party, but one particular hospital, due to its nature, requires heavy restrictions. We have to use their computers and the software is very outdated, with no chance of installing other software.\nWhat we want to do is simply use google apps via a browser. The browser they use is IE 8 or 9. We at IT have determined the reason why Calendar refuses to work is that the browser is too old. \nThe workaround I wanted to discuss is remote desktop connection. We currentyly use .rdp shortcuts to connect to our main server to use our medical software.

I want to use Ubuntu Server in its place. Can I have them remotely access the ubuntu server as simply and as painlessly as possible just to use Chrome?\nThank you for your help. I have very very little experience with Ubuntu and 0 with ubuntu server.\n\nA: You could store the windows version of Google Chrome (and it's subdirectories) on the server and just mount it using Samba, and run from there.  That way all clients would be running the same copy of Chrome, and they would all share data.\nYou would have to install it on Windows and copy the folder to the server, then share that server folder with samba, and mount it on the Windows machines as a samba share on bootup.  You should then be able to run it just fine.\n", "Q: problem installing jdk jvm E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\n\nA: It looks like you're already running something to install a package.

If you need more help please share de output of \"fdisk -l\".\n\nA: I can confirm that external multi-partitioned disks sometime do not mount automatically in Ubuntu 14.04 (randomly). It normally works better if the partition has a label --- but it's not foolproof. So I suggest the following thing: \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the disk. Look in /var/log/syslog for the device the disk has been assigned; for example in my case if I put the disk on I have:\n[...]\nOct 15 22:30:01 samsung-romano kernel: [30078.860813] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 43 00 00 00\nOct 15 22:30:01 samsung-romano kernel: [30078.861675] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA\nOct 15 22:30:01 samsung-romano kernel: [30078.922933]  sdb: sdb1 sdb2 sdb3 < sdb5 sdb6 >\n[...]\n\nso the disk is /dev/sdb. I know that the data partition (was /home before) is the /dev/sdb6 one. \n\n*put a label on it (umount the partition if needed). You can use gparted or manually; for example, if it's an ext[234] partition, you can use\nsudo tune2fs -L oldshome /dev/sdb6\n\n\n*eject and reconnect the disk. Most of the time, the disk will be automatically mounted on /media/YOURUSER/oldshome. \n\n*if not mounted, you can manually mount it with \nudisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sdb6 \n\nwhich has the same effect of an automount (no sudo needed, and it will be mounted in the same place as above). \nNotice: I think this is a kind of bug/misbehavior of the udisk2 helper. Sometime if is doing the opposite thing, and it don't let you \"eject\" the disk, remounting the partition as soon as you click on \"safely remove drive\" and you need to umount it manually. But it's random, so I never managed to collect enough data for a bug report. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Image Background breaking after build LiveCD i'm build a customization Ubuntu using UCK (https://launchpad.net/uck) and using a Image of Ubuntu 14.04.3.\nThe thing is, i replace the background warty-final-ubuntu.png in /usr/share/backgrounds for a another image, where this is image is also PNG.\nBut, when i build the ISO and run on VirtualBOX, the image is not loaded, looking like that.

I've sent a patch upstream and it will be fixed in the official kernels some time.\nNow you can install the module by running\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/bluetooth\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install btusb-lp1506615-dkms\n\nAfter you install the module power off the laptop, not just reboot. After that the bluetooth should work.\nAlso it makes sense to enable bluetooth and wireless coexistence by running:\nsudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf <<< \"options ath9k btcoex_enable=1\"\n\nThis will fix lags or disconnects when using Wi-Fi and bluetooth at the same time. It will be applied after reboot.\n", "Q: Symbolic Link Between USB and COM Port I want to use a Windows based scan tool under Wine on Ubuntu 14.04. I'm following these instructions to get it set up, but when I try to create the symbolic link ( step 7 ) I get an error:\nln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyS0\nln: failed to create symbolic link ‘/dev/ttyS0’: File exists\n\nI want to access the USB device via a COM port like COM1.\nIn the Wine documentation, it says simply to make a direct link to the USB device:\nln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/.wine/dosdevices/com2\n\n\nA: Normally you have a pre-existing device node called ttyS0 on your system. For example, I have: \n[romano:/dev] % ls -l /dev/ttyS0\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 oct 14 17:12 /dev/ttyS0\n\nGiving the timestamp, the device is probably created by the udev daemon at boot. \nIf you do not have a real serial port / modem connected or you do not want to use it, nobody stops you from removing the device node: \nrm /dev/ttyS0 \n\n(add the necessary sudos around). After that, you can symlink /dev/ttyUSB0 to it. \nI think the node will be recreated at next boot; otherwise you can regenerate it (after deleting the symlink) with: \n[romano:/dev] % sudo mknod /dev/ttyS0 c 4 64           \n[romano:/dev] % sudo chown root.dialout /dev/ttyS0\n[romano:/dev] % sudo chmod 660 /dev/ttyS0\n[romano:/dev] % ls -l /dev/ttyS0\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 oct 15 22:19 /dev/ttyS0\n\n", "Q: Find default desktop directory Years ago, we had a sysadmin who set up the default install so that all users start out with trash, their home folder, and some application launchers on their desktop.

I would like to find out what folder he used (it's not /etc/skel or anything in the xdg/* directory) to set this default, then modify it. \nModifying the directory is easy enough, how would I go about finding where this directory is?\nAdded info: these users will be logging in as local users authenticated against LDAP, we are using XFCE4 on Xubuntu.\n\nA: Where the desktop is is defined in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. If you want to place icons on the desktop, you have to create *.desktop files and put them into the folder [whatever comes after XDG_DESKTOP_DIR=].\n*.desktop files are structured like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nName=C++ Eclipse\nExec=\"/home/christoph/.IDEs/C++ Eclipse/eclipse\"\nIcon=/home/christoph/.IDEs/C++ Eclipse/icon.xpm\nKeywords=eclipse;c++;programming;developing;code;coding\n\nYou can find other examples (probably with a lot more content) in /usr/share/applications.

Click the Open With tab and select the application you want to use for that file type. Use the Set as default button to make the application the default application.\n", "Q: How to keep users out of system files? I'm trying to build a system that will be as idiot proof as possible.  This will include keeping regular users out of system files to prevent them from rendering the system inoperable.  And hopefully also keep them from reading or accessing files I don't want them to read or access.\nI've read that without sudo privileges, users are mostly limited to their home directories for writing and deleting.  Would that be enough to protect the operating system?\nAlso, is there a way to mostly limit users to their home directory for the file browser?  (I know users still need to access the bin and other directories to run other programs, and I'll be disabling terminal for normal users as well)\n\nA: Without sudo, users are limited to only having access to the /home directory in general, and then without permissions being modified for other users' home folders, they can only access their own home folder. So, as far as I know, what you're describing is largely the default behavior for non-sudo users.\nThat said, I think that any user can read many files in the system without sudo, but one really can't do anything without write permission anyhow, so I would consider that a moot point.\n", "Q: why does ls -Z returns files names with question marks next to them? why does ls -Z returns files names with question marks next to them?

One can imply that ? is displayed whenever /etc/selinux/config SELINUX is set to disabled.\nI have it set to disabled, but running ls -Z shows ? for some files while for others does return their security contexts. It is true that ? will be displayed when selinux is not installed/in use, but it is not the complete answer.\nThis article says ? means the absence of a security label for that file/object.\nTo add one, use chchon command.\n", "Q: Tips to install skype on 64bit Dicas para instalar skype no 64bits\nGostaria de instalar o skype 64bits e inicializá-lo junto com o sistema.

My thinkpad has two batteries delivering approximately 200Wh. However the main battery is aging a little, losing its capacity, or so the battery is telling me. \nWhat I wish to accomplish is to \"reset\" what the battery is telling the computer and override the reported capable energy capacity and have it attempt to charge the batteries to their original energy design, or perhaps overcharge them. \nIn otherwords, reflecting the data provided below, override \"energy-full\" and \"energy-full-design\" to user defined values to force the batteries to charge longer.\n$ upower -d\nDevice: /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0\n...\n    energy-full:         67.2668 Wh\n    energy-full-design:  82.16 Wh\n\nDevice: /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT1\n...\n    energy-full:         76.6344 Wh\n    energy-full-design:  93.24 Wh\n\nLater on I am going to physically open the battery encasement and add more battery cells in the free space, so knowing how to override this will be rather useful knowledge.\n\nA: This sounds really, really dangerous. After all, there is a reason why the engineers who designed the charging system made it respect aging batteries by not charging further!\nI seriously discourage you from trying anything like this. A Laptop battery can leave a big mess when exploding. And you don't want that to happen in your lap.\n\nA: The charging limits related to energy-full-design are implemented in the Li-Ion battery hardware, it is not possible to override them by software. Would be very dangerous indeed.\nWhat you really want to do is to recalibrate your batteries, which may (partially) recover the difference between energy-full-design and energy-full by telling the battery electronics to re-adjust the recorded charge level. Recalibration cannot compensate for wear though.\nInstall TLP (instructions) and use the commands \n    sudo tlp recalibrate BAT0\n    sudo tlp recalibrate BAT1\n\ninstructions\nRefer to the FAQ too.\n", "Q: Clipit's Offline Mode?

The suggested use of grub-install from Captain should have worked.\nThe only reason I could think of that it wouldn't would be that your BIOS could actually be booting off of the /dev/sdb device that I saw in your fdisk output.  In that case, you could try running:\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\n\nThat will install the grub MBR on the other physical disk in your system.\n\nA: I'm only new but almost every ossue I ran into with the grub screen was troubleshot booting from a live disc.

This includes the symlink python3.\nGiven that you have not removed python3.4, restore the original symlink with\n cd /usr/bin\n sudo rm python3\n sudo ln -s python3.4 python3\n\nCall Python3.5 directly with python3.5\n\nA: I had the same issue, and the following worked for me:\nsudo update-alternatives --config python3\n\nSelecting 1 genreated:\n* 1            /usr/bin/python3.5   1         manual mode\n\n\nA: Step 1: Opening a terminal\nYou said that you could not open a terminal any more. That is because the standard terminal emulator in Ubuntu is gnome-terminal, which can't run without a working python3, as that's one of its dependencies:\n$ apt-cache depends gnome-terminal | grep python\n Depends: python3\n Depends: python3-gi\n\nHowever, there are alternatives:\n\n*\n\n*Use another terminal emulator:\nYou can simply use another terminal emulator than gnome-terminal, for example xterm which should also be installed by default. Search it in the dash's application lens (Super+A) or just run xterm from the HUD (Alt+F2).\nA new terminal window will open from where you can undo your previous operations. It's (in my opinion) less comfortable than the default gnome-terminal, but surely does its job without depending on any Python components:\n$  LANG=C apt-cache depends xterm | grep python\n$  \n\n\n\n*Use a TTY terminal:\nInstead of using a terminal emulator (terminal window in a graphical environment) you can also temporarily switch to a real terminal (console only, no graphics) by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or any F [n] key with n in the range of 1 to 6).\nYou switch back to the graphical surface (usually TTY7) with Ctrl+Alt+F7 (or another F [n] key with n in the range of 7 to 12, depending on your user sessions).\nIn the TTY, you will have to log in by typing your username and password again first. Then it works like a normal terminal. Don't forget to log out of the TTY session again with Ctrl+D or the command exit when you're done.\n\nStep 2: Restoring the original python3\nWhatever method you used to get a terminal, the following reparation step is the same.\nYou have to restore the original /usr/bin/python3 file, which was actually a symlink to python3.4 (or absolute path /usr/bin/python3.4). This is done by the following simple command:\nsudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.4 /usr/bin/python3\n\n\nA: Terminals and other applications cannot be launched because the latest version of python3 on your ubuntu does not symlink to python3.\nYou can overcome this by doing a symlink in the following way:\nCheck the version of python3 in /usr/bin:\nls /usr/bin | grep python\n\nSelecting the latest version of the python3(python3.5) symlink becomes python3:\nsudo update-alternatives --config python3\n\nChoose your version of python3 (python3.5) with number. if successful, the result is \nupdate-alternatives: using /usr/bin/python3.5 to provide /usr/bin/python3 (python3) in manual mode\n\nOpen your default terminal or restart\n\nif there is an error in point 3, such as:\nupdate-alternatives: warning: forcing reinstallation of alternatives /usr/bin/python3.7 because the python3 link group is broken\n\nPlease repeat point 3 and choose another version of python3.\n", "Q: How can I mount an external USB pen connected to Ubuntu phone USB sticks don't automount when connected to my Ubuntu phone Bq Aquaris e5.

I've written a sudo command, and I suspect that it won't work. \nI want to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Do it without any sudo command \n\n*If it's possible (not important), have one unified script that just toggles between \"None\" and \"Intellihide\", so that I don't need to have two seperate keys.\n\n*If possible, have Docky refresh the configuration's values without having to exit and launch again.\n\n\n#!/bin/bash \ngconftool-2 -t string -s /apps/docky-2/Docky/Interface/DockPreferences/Dock1/Autohide \"Intellihide\" & \nsudo killall dockey & \ndocky\n\n\nA: Well, first of all, you are killing the wrong program. Your script has sudo killall dockey & but you want to kill docky, not dockey. That said, there is absolutely no reason for sudo, docky has been started by your user so you can kill it without any special privileges. You also don't need to send it to the background (that's what the & does).\nYou haven't explained why your script doesn't work but what is probably happening is that you run it and you see nothing happening (please always explain what the symptoms are when asking questions). This is because you are sending the sudo ... command to the background with &. sudo expects a password:\n$ sudo ls\n[sudo] password for terdon: \n\nSo, when you run it, it will provide a prompt asking for a password. Since you are running it in the background, you will never see that prompt and the script will be stuck, waiting for you to answer. \nI don't use docky and I have no idea if you can do this without restarting it but restarting seems to be the simplest option. Just change your script to:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngconftool-2 --get  /apps/docky-2/Docky/Interface/DockPreferences/Dock1/Autohide | grep -q None &&\n    gconftool-2 -t string -s /apps/docky-2/Docky/Interface/DockPreferences/Dock1/Autohide \"Intellihide\" ||\n    gconftool-2 -t string -s /apps/docky-2/Docky/Interface/DockPreferences/Dock1/Autohide \"None\"    \n\nkillall docky && docky\n\nThe && means AND, in other words \"run the next command only if the previous one was successful\". The || (OR) is the opposite, \"run the next command if the previous one failed. So, the script above will first query gconf for the current state of Autohide. The grep will only be successful if that matches None. If so, it is set to Intellihide and if not, it is set to None\nNote that && is not the same as &. The & sends commands to the background as described above and is not needed unless you want to send something to the background.

I got a Steam Controller and I need to get it working in Ubuntu, how do I do that?\n\nA: I have 15.10 and my controller wasn't working.\nI viewed the files mentioned above and I see a typo in the distribution provided file.  It has ATTRS{idVendor} twice.  The second one is supposed to be idProduct.\nTo recap, this is what the file used to say:\n# Steam Controller device node write access, per lp:1498655\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"28de\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"1102\", MODE=\"0666\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"28de\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"1142\", MODE=\"0666\"\n# Steam Controller udev write access, per lp:1498658\nKERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", TAG+=\"uaccess\"\n\nAnd this is what it was supposed to say (and works for me):\n# Steam Controller device node write access, per lp:1498655\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"28de\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1102\", MODE=\"0666\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"28de\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1142\", MODE=\"0666\"\n# Steam Controller udev write access, per lp:1498658\nKERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", TAG+=\"uaccess\"\n\n\nA: As noted by Jorge Castro.

This way if your install uses different accounts, you don't have to keep making changes to the file.\n\nA: I just got my Steam Controller, plugged it into my Ubuntu 15.10 x64 system and it wouldn't work, at all. However, I noticed something different about mine that wasn't mentioned here.\nI typed lsusb at the Terminal and found this:\nBus 001 Device 011: ID 28de:1042\n\nI noticed the idProduct listed in the default udev rules were \"1102\" or \"1142\". So, I added the following line to /lib/udev/rules.d/99-steam-perms.rules (Underneath the other similar lines):\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"28de\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1042\", MODE=\"0666\"\n\nI then unplugged the USB dongle, plugged it in and it works!

For television, movies, articles for magazines and newspapers or novels. Mostly they are very young and not technical savvy. They ask me for help when their Win/Osx brake and I then always try to persuade them to switch to linux.\nWell I did now persuade some to install elementary and some Ubuntu but to my disappointment those installs behave even worse than Windows (disapearing files, login loops, the comp does not wake up). I can not control what they are doing on their laptops (duh) so I want to ask:\nWhat is in Your experience the most \"foolproof\" Linux distribution right now?\n\nA: Linux is not meant to be fool-proof. Heck no operating is meant to be fool-proof. The main fool on any system is the admin; if he is not worth it problems will happen!\nLinux systems in general are identical so there is no \"best\" or \"more foolproof\", just a matter of what flavor someone likes most. We have a core kernel called Linux, we have a desktop that is Unity, Gnome, KDE, LXDE, XFCE, Mate. Sometimes this desktop is incorporated into a different download (like we have Kubuntu for KDE) or the operating system has 1 default where you can install another desktop alongside the current one or in place of the current one. And that is not limited to Ubuntu; this basically also applies to Fedora, SUSE, Debian. But the main thing is: for a lot of software we pull in the same software albeit it will be packaged differently between Debian based system and Fedora and SUSE. And even that difference is going to disappear in due time.\nBesides that: Ubuntu (Linux in general) is not even a geek operating system though the system is expected to be maintained by a user with knowledge, aka. an administrator, and 1 (the admin) or more people that are normal users. \nYes, it helps if the admin can code software. Yes, it helps if the admin is a computer enthusiast (which does not per se mean a geek). It can be a geek, but by no means does it need to be a geek. \nMain tasks of the admin: \n\n\n*\n\n*install software with Ubuntu Software Center;\n\n*update software with the updater;\n\n*fixing bugs users encounter.\n\n\nOnly the last one requires expertise. But this expertise is in using google: you need to be able to copy paste the problem into a google search box and be able to find a question on Ask Ubuntu with an answer that fits the problem. That does not require a user to be a geek. The fix might mean editing text files but even that can be solved by using the instructions provided by the answer containing the fix. It helps if the admin can assess whether the answer posted is a fix to the problem or not. But that is probably just a lack of experience if he can not.  \nAn operating system will, without regard to what it does, execute commands you issue. And in this you are worse off with both Linux and Unix compared to Windows. \nWe have a command line we use a LOT and for any and everything. It is a tool and like any tool it will do what you tell it to do so 1 \"space\" added next to a \"*\" to a \"rm\" command will ruin your system beyond repair. \n\n\n*\n\n*disappearing files\n\n\nProve it with a use-case otherwise it is meaningless. Ubuntu/Linux (any operating system, even Windows) does NOT willingly delete files. And our filesystem ext4 has been proven to be stable and reliable. If this is the case it should be reported as a -critical bug-. \n\n\n*\n\n*login loops\n\n\nThis generally happens when someone uses the admin account to mess with user accounts and unknowingly changes the permissions of files. General tip: check the .xsession-errors file in the home of that user. It will include pointers on what the problem is. \n\n\n*\n\n*the comp does not wake up\n\n\nCan happen but this highly depends on your hardware. Some hardware just refused to play nice and the only solution is to NOT use suspend and/or hibernate. Please search this site for solutions others posted since there will be plenty of them.\nNevertheless: this is a 1st-time usage issue. You check if suspend/hibernate works after 1st install, if it does not you can attempt to fix it, if not possible you disable it. That a user sees this problem happen is the admin to blame, he should have solved this before handing the system over.\n\nI can not control what they are doing on their laptops\n\nWant to take a wager on that? I can guarantee you that my parents, who use an Ubuntu machine, will not be able to mess that system up besides the own user area (aka /home/$USER) and any user can delete the directories in /home/$USER/. Is that foolish? Yes. Should you prevent it? No.\n", "Q: How do I check the version of Ubuntu I am running?

Is there any setting that I can try to get a really full screen? I recievied a video call with ratio of 640x480 (i have checked the technical informations during a call) and my screen resolution is 1366x768(16:9) my video card is intelgraphics incorporated, thanks for now Vladi.UPDATE: Today I recieved a video call from skype and I picked up from skype installed on windows 7 in my machine running Virtual Box, strange the same machine which I have xubuntu (linux) (host), and the call in fullscreen mode was perfect with no stripes on the sides!!! I think there is some configuration on skype for linux that I can achieve the same fullscreen mode that was in windows guest machine.\n\nA: The reason the black bars are present is that the original video being sent by the other person's camera is in a 4:3 aspect ratio (you mentioned it was  640x480), while you said your screen is 1366x768 which as you mentioned is a 16:9 aspect ratio.\nIf the Skype application took it upon itself to stretch the image, rather than using the black bars to present the original aspect, you'd see something like this:\n4:3 to 16:9 Stretched Image\n", "Q: How to replace numbers in an XML file with their double value?

How can I convert this into a physical machine to be installed to a partition on my hard drive? My host operating system is windows.\nI have not found much material on line, and that I did find was confusing. For instance I'd read similar questions, only to realize the host os was Ubuntu as well rather than windows.\nCreating a disk image may be an option, but I have never done such a thing before. I have a 32gb pen drive if required to create some sort of install media.\n\nA: Converting a VM into a physical installation is extremely difficult and usually ends badly.\nThe only way to really proceed is to do a fresh installation of Ubuntu onto your hard drive, and then manually copy data you want to keep out of the VM to external USB drives or such, and then copy back into the fresh install.\n\nA: Overview\nAs an updated answer to this question for 2022, such a process is much more common than previously and while Thomas' answer may have been true to an extent once upon a time, in general* it's actually not as difficult as the previous answer might've made it seem.\nTo clarify, prior to Windows 8 & 10, Windows would've actually been the more difficult scenario moving from VM to Physical or vice versa simply because of not just the activation protection for genuine copies of Windows, but also Windows' Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) and the dependence of drivers along with the kernel on the actual hardware, as explained here. With Windows 10, Microsoft has made it so that Windows does a better job of adapting to sudden hardware changes\nHowever, in the OP's case, it's a host Windows machine running a virtual version of Ubuntu using VirtualBox. While the process is somewhat tedious for some, it's not something I'd describe as extremely difficult IF you were talking about just converting a virtual machine and dropping it into a bare physical machine (no other existing operating system or need to retain another OS).\n* What is difficult is if you are looking to have it become a part of dual-boot setup and you only have one hard drive. Then you'll have a VM that was created with multiple virtual partitions and are trying to put those multiple partitions into a single physical partition and would need to specify partition offsets and causes by consequence the added work of having to setup Grub and your bootloader all separately to play friendly with Windows, using a rescue process of some sort. It's in this case, that I would agree with the previous answer of simply doing a fresh install on the desired other partition so that the installer can take can take care of configuring your boot options as part of the installation process.\nHowever, if you or whomever comes across this, and ideally have another hard drive to install the VM to, the process is described below.\nConverting Virtual System (Linux-based) created in a Windows environment (Host OS)\nTo go about this, the process involves converting the virtual machine first into a a disk image using VBoxManage and then booting into a live boot USB of a linux system to write that image to your hard drive. This is process is slightly different when it comes to sharing a hard drive with Windows and having it be applied to a different partition. For those using a new hard though, a direct write to the disk from the image file will be sufficient and is included in the steps below prior to the steps given for the request made by the OP.\nMore on VirtualBox cloning found here.\nCreating the VM image file\nOpen an elevated command prompt (Run as Administrator) and navigate to the installed directory for VirtualBox (or alternatively, you can add the install directory to your PATH so that you can run VBoxManage from the location of the VM file)\nFor below, we'll assume VirtualBox is installed at the default path of\nC:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox and our example VM is located in another folder which we will reference as C:\\MyVMs\\example.vdi and we will be writing the image to an external USB drive (D:) at D:\\VMFolder\\ naming it VMimage.img\n# Adding VirtualBox's installed directory to our working environment\n# This only changes the PATH temporarily within our command prompt window\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32> set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\n\n# no output will indicate success but if you want to check if it's working\n# you can either use echo:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32> echo %PATH%\n\n# or simply try to run VBoxManage:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32> vboxmanage list hdds\n\n# which outputs a list of all your installed VMs\n\nUsing the same elevated command prompt:\n# Navigate to the location of our VM\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32> cd C:\\MyVms\n\n# You should now see the command prompt as:\n\nC:\\MyVMs>\n\n# Run the command to convert our VM to a raw image file\n\nC:\\MyVMs> VBoxManage internalcommands converttoraw example.vdi D:\\VMFolder\\VMimage.img\n\n# After hitting enter, it should show an output similar to this:\n\nConverting image example.vdi with size 512110190592 bytes (488387MB) to raw...\n\n# Prepare yourself, this may take awhile\n\nDepending on how large your VM is, how fast your hard drive's read/write speed is, and the speed of the USB Drive (D: in our case), this might take quite a bit of time. For me, running this took about 30-40 minutes and you'll know it's complete when you see the Command line prompt available again.\n\nApplying the .img to a physical hard disk (General)\nFor those who are taking the path of less resistance and would like to apply the image to a new hard disk, or in a new system with no current OS needing to be run alongside, the image can be applied by booting up a live boot USB of their preferred Linux distro (selecting the option to try a live demo test system or equivalent), opening a terminal window, and run the following (making sure the destination for the image is not mounted in the live boot system):\nFor the below examples, the formerly referenced USB drive on Windows (D:) will now be referenced on the Linux system as /media/user/usb whereas the USB live boot resides on /dev/sda (and appears as the primary system drive) and makes the local hard drive (again, unmounted) appear on something like /dev/sdb\nYou can double check your layout by running blkid or fdisk -l then:\ndd if=/media/user/usb/VMFolder/VMimage.img of=/dev/sdb conv=sync,noerror status=progress bs=64K\n\nThe options can be omitted if desired, but to explain:\n\n*\n\n*conv=sync,noerror tells dd that if it can't read a block due to a read error, then it should at least write something to its output of the correct length\n\n*status=progress outputs some information as dd is doing it's thing to help you understand how far long in the process it is\n\n*bs=64K is the block size of 64x1024 Bytes. Some may suggest using bigger block sized to increase the speed of the copying/write process but to each their own.\n\nAt this point, some additional steps can be taken while in the live boot session environment to ensure booting goes smoothly but is beyond the scope of this answer as it diverts from the OP's question. But, for the most part it should be able to boot without much, if any, trouble. If not, try this article or this one for troubleshooting boot issues.\nIn case one is uncertain of how to create a live boot USB system, one example tutorial for Ubuntu can be found here.\n\nApplying the .img to a physical hard disk (Specific to OP)\nAs aforementioned, the difficulty of this process is more prevalent when trying to install the converted VM to a partition on the same hard drive as your current Windows system. Since the OP mentioned having never created a system image before then it would be advisable, once again, to follow the advice of the previously submitted answer as it requires a much more advanced application and use of various commands, not to mention troubleshooting steps that could easily be avoided.\nSide note: After going through the steps and seeing just how much troubleshooting it would incur, I've revised the instructions a bit as it became blindingly obvious that if nothing else, you should at least use the installer to install a new version of Ubuntu alongside Windows following a guide like this one or one of your choice. And then, after the installation is successful and you can boot into both systems, assuming that you used the same installer for the VM as you would for the fresh install on the physical system, then proceed with the steps below.\nOverview and Explaining the Difficulties\nWhen the image of the VM is created, the image file itself is the entire system and includes a partition table as part of the image. Since, generally speaking, an install of Ubuntu would often result in creating 3 different partitions (4 if you opt to use a swap partition) when installing for a system that utilizes UEFI, then  it becomes apparent that we only need to extract the partition where the main bulk of the OS resides on if we want to run our pre-tested and used system.\nIn other words, you would only be interested in copying the root (\"/\") partition, sometimes referred to as the user partition, to the available partition on your hard drive but then you'd be missing the boot and EFI partitions (if applicable for the latter) which would then need to be adapted to reside with wherever your windows bootloader is located, just to boot properly. This in turn creates a need for you to also set up Windows to ignore the partition Ubuntu is on in Disk Manager in case it might detect it as a hard drive corruption and attempt to run chdisk upon the next boot.\nThus to avoid all those issues mentioned above, and as aforementioned, using the same installer as you used for your VM to install a fresh version of Ubuntu first will help avoid those issues as you can simply copy the VM system's primary (or root partition) to overwrite the same partition that the fresh install would have made to more simply take its place, rather than have to troubleshoot all the issues that would inevitably arise. Then, a quick update to some of the boot configurations and you'll be set to go.\nDetermine the partition sizes and sectors\nYou'll need to gather some information in order to only write the main partition of the VM image to your physical partition. After installing the fresh version of Ubuntu, determine which partition on the physical drive your root directory for Ubuntu lies. Then for the image file, we will need to get the offset of the root partition for the original VM system.\nUsing the same references as above, from a terminal window in a live boot USB session run:\nfdisk -l /media/user/usb/VMFolder/VMimage.img\n\n\nThe output of fdisk will provide information that consists of a summary about the disk image and then list each of its partitions with a column for Device, Start, End, Sectors, Size and Type. Since partitions are not guaranteed to be laid out on disk in their numeric order without padding, it may be better to mount the root partition of the image disk file to a loopback device first before copying it to your physical disk partition.\nTo do this, after gathering the information from the command above, you'll need to determine the correct offset for the root partition (usually the largest one on the drive) of the VM's system image. The offset you need is the start of a partition multiplied by the sector size.\nFor example if the start is 128 and sector size is 512 then the offset is 65536. To be sure, the sector size is found near the top in the summary part of the output for fdisk while the start is in one of the columns for the listed partitions. Also, to ensure you use the right offset, the start might be a much larger number as it will be farther along in the disk image, and for example may be something like 1001472 for the start, and so with a sector size of 512, the offset that's more likely going to be used might look more like 512753664 in that case.\n# There are two ways to accomplish the mount of the partition\n# to a loop device. Choose one of them, I suggest the 2nd one\n\n### Option 1\n# make a temporary mount point in the live boot system\n\nsudo mkdir /mnt/tmpboot\n\n# then mount with the offset calculated as explained above\n\nsudo mount -o loop,offset=512753664 /media/user/usb/VMFolder/VMimage.img /mnt/tmpboot\n\n### Option 2\n# alternatively, you can use 'losetup to accomplish the same thing without\n# the need to create a temporary mount point, which also helps avert\n# the risk of the partition being read/active when copying.\n# Replace '512753664' with the offset you calculated earlier\n\nsudo losetup -o 512753664 /dev/loop0 /media/user/usb/VMFolder/VMimage.img\n\n### After Option 1 or 2\n# the root partition of the image file now resides on \n# either /dev/loop0 or /mnt/tmpboot | Now to write \n# the partition using either of the above\n# you will need to replace 'sdb3' with the correct partition\n# that the fresh installation had created\n\ndd if=/dev/loop0 of=/dev/sdb3 conv=sync,noerror status=progress bs=64K\n\n# In case it's not obvious for above, replace /dev/loop0 with /mnt/tmpboot\n# if you chose the former, option 1 \n\n\nSince you'll be missing the boot partition and EFI partition when attempting to boot you might have to opt for making the partition an LVM in order to create multiple partitions within a partition which means the above commands won't work for you and would've required the VM to use LVM during setup as well.\nSince it would be too late for that, you could try copying the contents of the boot partition into the Window's System Reserved partition so that when you run\nIn case your VM is running with LVM, and you have trouble mounting the partition as directed, refer to the page for How to mount an LVM volume from a dd/raw/vmdk image?\nSince a bootloader would've been installed by the fresh Ubuntu install, you will need to update some of the configurations of the newly copied partition's system files so that it can recognize the transplant that took place.\nAs a side note, there are alternative methods for going about all this, such as using qemu which can be found here.\nFinalizing for Boot\nWith the image's partition now written to the physical drive, you will need to mount the physical drive's partition containing the VM's root partition and make some modifications.\n# if it doesn't already exist create a mount point\n\nsudo mkdir /mnt\n\n# then mount the newly written partition\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt\n\n# to make modifications to that system as that system (and not\n# as the live boot USB system, we will need to chroot our way in\n# this simply translates into running the following commands\n\nsudo mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount -t sysfs sys /mnt/sys\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount -t devpts pts /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n# now we are in the VM's system acting similarly to if it was\n# booted up and running, changes we make here affect our \n# physical system\n\nFor this part of fixing boot, we will need to:\n\n*\n\n*Update the Grub Bootloader\n\n*Check & Update fstab with any changes to UUIDs\n\n*Update the initramfs if applicable\n\nThe above can be simplified if you want to use a script like this one instead. Otherwise to quickly cover it manually:\n# Update Grub by running below to override the booted UUID\n\nsudo grub-install\n\n# Run grub update to change the grub boot menu\n\nsudo update-grub\n\n# Alternatively, you could modify the configuration in /etc/default/grub\n# by updating the following line\n\nGRUB_DEVICE_UUID=***INSERT NEW UUID HERE***\n\n# Then running the update-grub command from above\n\n# -------\n\n# To check fstab, we will need to note the UUIDs of all the partitions\n# currently set for current boot partition and home partition\n# just to be extra careful, get it by running\n\nblkid\n\n# Now check and update fstab if needed\n# You can replace nano with a different text editor\n# if preferred (such as vim or gedit)\n\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n# Replace the UUID for home with the newly written partition's UUID\n# and double check the UUID for boot matches the one reported by blkid\n# Close and save by hitting Ctrl+X answering Yes to save changes\n# hit Enter to confirm the filename and overwriting then run\n\nsudo update-initramfs\n\n\nA more in-depth look at updating Grub can be found here.\nA more thorough explanation of fstab can be found here.\nThat should be about it! Unless you run into trouble with some ACPI issues or Secure Boot Issues when trying to boot, but those would've been made apparent after the fresh install of Ubuntu on the physical system.\nSome *Extra* Final Steps\nBefore restarting, though not required, you can exit chroot and unmount all the drives, starting with the sub paths. Otherwise, simply typing exit (twice, once to exit chroot and again to close the terminal window), and closing down the live boot session by shutting down and removing the USB will suffice. But to fair on the safe side, it's best to build a habit of unmounting those partitions we had mounted in case it might come bite us back in the future.\n# To exit chroot\n\nexit\n\n# then unmount everything (sub paths first)\n\numount /mnt/proc\numount /mnt/sys\numount /mnt/dev/pts\numount /mnt/dev\numount /mnt\n\n# and if desired, for laziness\n\nsudo reboot\n\n# otherwise exit the liveboot session through the shutdown menu\n# so as to safely remove the USB live boot USB device\n\n\nI can see now, why Thomas just answered more simply the former.

Although the live CDs would run, and the installers worked, on start-up the laptop would not proceed past the grub bootloader.\nSince I hadn't been using Windows for 6 months (using Ubuntu on my main m/c) I let the installers use the whole hard disk.  And again, got nothing.  In BIOS, after the Asus splashscreen, using Esc to access the BIOS, with Secure Boot disabled, CSM/Legacy enabled and the I/O USB unlocked (the Asus has no optical drive so I was using a USB DVD writer) again total failure.  The laptop didn't work at all. \nRescued with Knoppix 7 - thank you, Knoppix developers!  That got the Asus a working operating system, at least.\nTaking heart, I tried to install Ubuntu which failed again, and Linix Mint which also failed.  Then I tried other distros, Mageia, OpenSUSE. \nAt one point I had to again install Knoppix to get the laptop a working OS again.  The only distro (of those I tried) that worked on this particular Asus laptop was OpenSUSE.  Initially 13.2, but since it worked, now it's working with OpenSUSE Leap 17.1 installed (KDE version).\nIn conclusion for this particular laptop, I can only guess there's some basic hardware incompatibility.  For this one, it's OpenSUSE or Knoppix.  Though I can live with either since this laptop was to be used for mainly composing essays, I will stick with Ubuntu or Linux Mint on my main computer.\n", "Q: MATLAB R2015b 64bit Installation Problem I am having a problem while installing MATLAB R2015b.\nI have downloaded the .iso file, copied all the files in /home/user/R2015b_glnxa64.

I want to mount the older one on the newer one to copy some of my old stuff across.\nThe Volume group names are the same on both systems.  I've found Mount external hard drive with LUKS Encryption + LVM which tells me about vgimportclone.  It's not clear from the man page though whether this will change the volume group data on disk in a way that means I can't boot into the old system, which could be disastrous.\nWhat's the safest way to do this?\n\nA: The new system was relatively low value (some setup effort, but nothing hard to replace), so I decided to mess with that instead.\nI booted from USB (using the mint install system), and did the following (where `sdb5 is the encrypted partition that houses the lvm data for my new system)\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb5 newdisk\nvgimportclone /dev/mapper/newdisk\npvscan\nvgscan\nlvscan\n\nI'm not sure that those scans are actually necessary, but i did them, and then I looked around with pvdisplay, vgdisplay and lvdisplay.  All looks fine.\nI tried re-booting at this point, which didn't work.  Grub couldn't find the disk, and complained with a message like this one.\nI booted back into the installer, and fixed up the references to /dev/mapper/mint--vg-root and /dev/mapper/mint--vg-swap in /etc/grub/grub.cfg and /etc/fstab.\nThe system boots, and I can now mount the old drive using the GUI tools (nemo), albeit it's a tad inelegant, with an error displayed from the attempt to mount the encrypted partition, after which the unecrypted one is available to mount.\nSo, it seems OK.  I've greped for mint--vg in /etc and /boot, and found nothing else to fix up.  I'll add more info here if I come across anything else that needs fixing up.\n", "Q: Adjust date and time informations inside several text files automatically from the command-line I have a folder with several text files which content is something like this:\ntext text\nmore text\nDate: Thu, 31 Dec 2015 23:53:51 +0000 (UTC)\nmore text\nsome more\n\nI want that date and time to be correct accordingly to my time zone (in my case, if it says \"+0000 (UTC)\" I have to add 1 hour, for winter time)\nSo the result should be the same file (same filename or if you want \"adjusteddate_originalfilename\") containing:\ntext text\nmore text\nDate: Fri, 1 Jan 2016 00:53:51\nmore text\nsome more\n\nNote that the line that has to be edited begins with \"Date: \" (which is unique, there is no other \"Date: \" in the text file) and ends in \"+0000 (UTC)\".

I'm running Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: You can use GNU date to convert that time to your local time zone.  \n awk '/^Date:.*UTC/ {cmd=\"date -Rd \\\"\" substr($0,6) \"\\\"\"; cmd | getline new; close(cmd); $0=\"Date: \" new} 1' file\ntext text\nmore text\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 01:53:51 +0200\nmore text\nsome more\n\nIf you have GNU awk, you can change in-place all the files in the current directory using:\ngawk -i inplace '/^Date:.*UTC/ {cmd=\"date -Rd \\\"\" substr($0,6) \"\\\"\"; cmd | getline new; close(cmd); $0=\"Date: \" new} 1' *\n\nWithout GNU awk, use:\nfor f in *\ndo\n    awk '/^Date:.*UTC/ {cmd=\"date -Rd \\\"\" substr($0,6) \"\\\"\"; cmd | getline new; close(cmd); $0=\"Date: \" new} 1' \"$f\" >tmp && mv tmp \"$f\"\ndone\n\nHow it works\n\n\n*\n\n*-i inplace\nThis tells GNU awk to change files in place.  This requires a modern GNU awk.  If you use Mike's awk, then use instead the bash loop as shown above.\n\n*/^Date:.*UTC/ {cmd=\"date -Rd \\\"\" substr($0,6) \"\\\"\"; cmd | getline new; close(cmd); $0=\"Date: \" new}\nThis selects lines that start with Date: and contain UTC on the same line.  For those lines, the command date -Rd is run on the part of the line containing the date.  The result is stored in the variable new.  Then, the current line, denoted by $0 in awk, is replaced by one with the new date.\n\n*1\nThis is awk's cryptic shorthand for print-the-line.\nMultiple line GNU version\nIf you prefer your scripts spread over multiple lines:\ngawk -i inplace '\n\n/^Date:.*UTC/ {\n    cmd=\"date -Rd \\\"\" substr($0,6) \"\\\"\"; cmd | getline new\n    close(cmd)\n    $0=\"Date: \" new\n}\n\n1\n' file\n\nSome refinements (non-GNU version)\n\n\n*\n\n*The code above looks for lines starting with Date: that also contain the letters UTC.  This appears to me to be good enough.  The question, however, asks more specifically for lines that start Date: and end with +0000 (UTC).  \n\n*The question also asks to eliminate the trailing +0200 from non-UTC date lines.\nAdding these two refinements, the code becomes:\nfor f in *\ndo\n    awk '/Date: .* [+]0200$/{sub(/ [+]0200$/,\"\")} /^Date: .* [+]0000 [(]UTC[)]$/ {cmd=\"date -Rd \\\"\" substr($0,6) \"\\\"\"; cmd | getline new; close(cmd); $0=\"Date: \" new} 1' \"$f\" >tmp && mv tmp \"$f\"\ndone\n\nThis code is more precise but also more persnickety.  For example, this code insists that a line end with +0000 (UTC) before it will change it.   Consequently, lines with trailing whitespace, which may be invisible in your editor, will not be changed.

I am trying to write a solution for another user, when I noticed that sudo ulimit -c returns command not found. So then I tried this:\n$ sudo ulimit -c\n  sudo: ulimit: command not found\n\n$ ulimit -c\n0\n\n$ sudo -i\n# ulimit -c\n0\n\nso... it works from root, and it works with out sudo, but not with sudo. Is this a bug?\n\nA: ulimit is a shell built-in command like cd\nyou can't use like:\nsudo cd /test/\n\nsimilarly you can't use \nsudo ulimit -c\n\nThis is not a separate program. sudo looks for a binary to run, but there is no ulimit binary.\nIf you want to change  your limit  then you can define limits in limits.conf file. Those limits are defined in /etc/security/limits.conf or /etc/security/limits.d/.\nyou can take help from this question\nor\nuse shell like:\nsudo sh -c \"ulimit -c\"\nsudo bash -c \"ulimit -c\"\nsudo bash -c ulimit \nsudo sh -c \"ulimit -n\"\n\n\nA: \nIs this a bug?\n\nNo.  sudo has no knowledge of commands that are built in to the various shells, like ulimit and cd.\nYou've been presented with two ways of addressing this — using a shell as an intermediary and adjusting the limits elsewhere than on the command line itself.  Here is a third, for the situations when one is trying to use such commands to make modifications to process state rather than to display it.\nIf one could run the shell builtins as sudo ulimit … or sudo cd … to actually modify process state, that would not be particularly useful.  That would run nothing else afterwards, in the process whose limits or working directory had been changed.  One would adjust process limits or working directory only to immediately exit the process.\nBut there are toolsets with chain-loading external commands with these functions.  They do the same thing as the shell builtins but also chain load to another program after they have done so.\nThey are the various daemontools-family toolsets — daemontools, daemontools-encore, nosh, perp, s6, freedt, and runit.\nThe tools for setting limits and then chain loading to another program are variously softlimit (daemontools), softlimit (freedt), softlimit (daemontools-encore) softlimit (nosh), s6-softlimit (s6), chpst (runit), and runlimit (perp).  So one could run, say, vim with an altered core file size limit using daemontools, daemontools-encore, nosh, or freedt with the command:sudo softlimit -c 0 vimnosh also has a similar ulimit command that uses different unit sizes for the various limits to the ones used with softlimit:sudo ulimit -c 0 vim\nThe same goes for changing directory, for which there are the nosh chdir external chain-loading command:sudo chdir /etc vim rc.localand the cd external command from execline:sudo /command/cd /etc vim rc.local\n", "Q: how can i install Boost 1.55 on Ubuntu 15.10?

Just boots into grub recovery Okay,\nSo I am definitely a noob, but I got really tired of ubuntu not allowing me to suspend without hard blocking my wifi, so I went ahead and tried to install opensuse to see if the problem was just ubuntu, but that failed because I couldn't figure out the installation process. So then I proceeded to try and install kali, just to see if it would let my internet work. Well, when I installed kali, I got most of the way through, but towards the end of the installation it said that the installation was complete and to make sure I remove the usb before rebooting. So I clicked out of that screen, but my installation was only at 61%, I gave it 30 minutes hoping it would just complete, but it didn't, so I just pulled out my usb (probably made a few of you cringe there, sorry). So I figured, well crap, now I've probably messed up big time, so I decided to try and go back to ubuntu with my ubuntu live usb. Now here is where my problem is, any time I try to run my ubuntu live usb, It boots into the kali image screen (where it asks if you want to run live or install) but will not effectively run anything from there. I can't boot into live or anything. So to try and solve this, I used my kali live usb, but it won't even go back to the image screen, it just boots to grub recovery from there. \nI'm sure I messed up big time and I'm wondering if I can just wipe my computer and start fresh. I have everything backed up that I need, so I'm not worried about any data. Thank you!\n\nA: Are you able/do you know how to access the boot options menu on your computer? If you have your live USB plugged in, and power on your machine while holding/repeatedly pressing the right key (on my computer it is F12, but that will differ depending on manufacturer), you should be able to access the boot menu and select your live USB.

You can see the effect in the screen shot below. I am currently running 15.04, but had the same problem with 14.04.\n\nI have found several posts here, like this one, but have not found a solution. I have however, made an observation that might help to diagnose the problem. Others have noted that the issue occurs with high memory usage. Recently I have installed this amazing gnome-shell extension, and using that extension, I realized that the problem seems to appear as soon as I start swapping. I realize that high memory usage and swapping coincide, but it seems to be the swapping specifically that causes it for me. To test this theory, I lowered my swappiness value to 0 with the command:\n$ sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0\n\nAnd had less issues with it than ever, presumably because I was swapping less often (it was set to Ubuntu default 60 before this) - although the problem did return once I eventually started swapping again (3GB of RAM on this computer). Also, I noticed that I could make the problem go away by turning swap on and off with swapoff -a and then swapon -a as root. Although I have lessened the problem quite a bit, I am still curious about two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does this diagnosis make sense, and if so, why would using swap affect the graphics in such a way? It seems like once it starts swapping it is taking memory that is meant for graphics, but I don't know enough about Linux yet to know how to check/stop something like that.\n\n*If this sounds way off, do you have any other guesses what could be going wrong?\nIt is a point of pride for me recently to be completely off OS X which I used for about 15 years before switching over completely to Ubuntu about 6 months ago, and I couldn't be happier with Ubuntu, and the Linux community in general, but this has been the one sticking point for me. I am sure this has more to do with my old hardware (which otherwise runs Linux flawlessly) than anything else, and is not a failing of Ubuntu, but I am just hoping that someone out there will have a solution or at least a suggestion.

Can someone explain it? Also, is there any impact on the reliability of the partition, or on performance when writing and reading from it? Is one of them better-suited for my purpose? Are there any implications to just leaving the partition \"unallocated\" as it currently is? Thanks!\nanswered in most part by JdeBP 2014.01.24, improved by user29020 2014.07.12:\nThese two options are unfortunately listed along with the others that act in a different manner. The other options are all filesystem formats, where the new partition is created with the selected format. The two options of interest are essentially the two null options.\n\n\n*\n\n*If one leaves a partition \"unformatted\" then no attempt to write filesystem data structures to it is made at all. But it might have them already, by accident or by design.\n\n*If one \"clears\" a partition, then the various signatures in well-known places that operating systems use to detect filesystem types ( http://jdebp.eu./FGA/determining-filesystem-type.html ) are wiped.\n\n\nSo, rather ironically, clearing a partition will give one the guarantee of it being unformatted as a result, whereas an unformatted partition may remain formatted as before.\n", "Q: who to resolve the issue )--- Error of the failed to scan error communicating (Samsung scanner ) we issue Ubuntu 12.04 version in desktop and also using Samsung printer 2876nd ,\nIn the Samsung printer printing , xcopy ,flatted & ADF both are working but facing the Issue of the scanning showing \nThe error of the failed to scan error communicating.\n\nA: Samsung has a great install kit;\nhttp://org.downloadcenter.samsung.com/downloadfile/ContentsFile.aspx?CDSite=UNI_HK_EN&CttFileID=6283513&CDCttType=DR&ModelType=N&ModelName=CLX-3305W&VPath=DR/201510/20151027115542328/uld_v1.00.36_00.91.tar.gz\nInstall it and verify that your user belong in the sane group\n", "Q: Can I remove boot medium after boot from live usb/cd So if I boot from usb, can I remove that usb after boot.\nAlso is it possible to save the session information to the boot medium or any secondary storage, so that my desktop icons etc. look the same every time I boot from usb\n\nA: I think you can not remove the USB/CD before shutting live os.\nI hope this is what you're looking for.\nHere is described instructions liveCD\n\nAfter you have finished, shut the computer down and remove the CD. \nAt this point anything you saved to the desktop or Documents folders and such will vanish - only things you saved into folders on the hard-drive will remain.

I have honed a few techniques in several years and thousands of forum posts.\nFirst, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nIf these changes do not help, please try:\nsudo -i\necho \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nexit\n\n\nA: Thank you guys for your help. The solution that finally worked for me was simply a system update. I used a USB network card to do a full system and kernel update. After rebooting, I can connect to the network.

The main purpose for me to set up the web server was to open GUI applications on my system through the server by pressing a html button. \nMy goal is to leave a computer attached to the TV and be able to control it using my phone.

The NVIDIA driver, modifies the kernel when it installs. Later, you accept kernel updates, and the older kernel with the NVIDIA modules is no longer in use. \nIts probably a good idea to update your kernel periodically, just keep in mind that any previously installed kernel modules will not be present in the updated kernel. You can always reinstall. Or you could not do kernel updates.\nOr, you could boot to your older kernel with the modules you previously installed.\n", "Q: Play music to bluetooth, but system sounds to internal speakers When I connect my Bluetooth speakers, all audio goes to bluetooth.\nI would like only music to be routed to the bluetooth speakers, but all other audio from the system (alarms, skype, audio in firefox, whatever...) to still be played through the computer's internal speakers.\nIs this possible?\n(I currently have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and my usual music player is gmusicbrowser)\nAs requested in the comments, here are the (very normal) sound settings, which don't seem to have any fine-grained routing options, only application muting/volume:\n\n\n\nA: Yes it is, through pavucontrol.\nIn fact, that's my configuration too.\nSpotify goes to CSL-27998 (my Bluetooth adapter) and everything else goes to the Internal Stereo (because this is the one selected in the screen you posted).\n\nEDIT: This is my configuration on the Sound System Setting\n\nPlease also note that when you modify the settings in the System Setting (second screenshot) it resets what you did in pavucontrol (because it's more coarse) and redirects everything to the output you choose.\n", "Q: Kernel 4.2.3 in Ubuntu 14.04 with startup errors From kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/..., I installed v4.2.3 on my 14.04 64bit system with AMD A8-6600K, integrated GPU Radeon HD8570D.\nThe system seems to run, uses the graphic driver “Gallium 0.4 on AMD ARUBA”.

To make this module a permanent fixture of your current kernel we'll add it to the list of modules that are loaded at boot time and move it to the proper location.\nsudo mv eee.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/\n\nThen edit the /etc/modules file and add the module name eee to the end of the file.\nNext register and load the new module into the kernel.\nsudo depmod -a\nsudo modprobe eee\n\nIn general, jumping directly to the overclocked speed can cause lockups so smaller jumps toward the speed are suggested. Below is an example of gradually making your way to the overclocked speed:\nsudo sh -c 'echo 85 24 1 > /proc/eee/fsb'\nsudo sh -c 'echo 100 24 1 > /proc/eee/fsb'\necho \"FSB overclocked to 100MHz\"\n\nAnd going back down to the default speeds again:\nsudo sh -c 'echo 85 24 1 > /proc/eee/fsb'\nsudo sh -c 'echo 70 24 1 > /proc/eee/fsb'\necho \"FSB returned to 70MHz\"\n\n", "Q: How to use my old kernel?

Below is the system information now.\n$ uname -a\nLinux myMachine 4.2.3 #1 SMP Fri Oct 16 20:45:01 EDT 2015 x86_64 x86_64    x86_64 GNU/Linux \n$ uname -r\n4.2.3\n$ cat /proc/version \nLinux version 4.2.3 (sps@myMachine) (gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu  4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) ) #1 SMP Fri Oct 16 20:45:01 EDT 2015\n$\n\nSo it looks like new kernel (4.2.3) is running in my system (Please let me know if I need to check any other command (apart from uname or cat /proc/version) to be sure about the kernel that is running).\nNow here is my issue:- I don't know what issues I will face later if I keep using this kernel. \nSo I want to revert back and start using the previous kernel again. How do I do it ?\nI can still see the old vmlinuz-3.19* (and other 3.19*) files in /boot/ and also in boot/grub/grub.cfg. But I do not know how to start using the old kernel once again ?\nBonus if I can select the kernel at boot time.\n\nA: Well, you didn't package your kernel, which is going to make things a bit harder. First, you need to delete the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot/vmlinuzKERNEL-VERSION\n\n*/boot/initrdKERNEL-VERSION\n\n*/boot/System-mapKERNEL-VERSION\n\n*/boot/config-KERNEL-VERSION\n\n*/lib/modules/KERNEL-VERSION\nYour compiled Linux has been removed. Now, you should be able to run update-grub and it, hopefuly, won't find anything related to your old kernel. Look at the output and see if the kernel you compiled is in there.\nIf you want to select what kernel you want to use at startup, you have to set GRUB to show when you turn on your computer. Open up your favorite text editor as root and edit GRUB's configuration file, which is located at /etc/default/grub. You'll find a line that says GRUB_TIMEOUT. This setting says how many seconds you want GRUB to show. It's probably set to 0, which is where your problem lies. Set it to something like 5 seconds instead by changing the 0 to a 5. Also, is you see a line that says anything like GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT and/or hiddenmenu, remove them in their entirety from the file. Save and exit, and make sure to run update-grub. You should be able to reboot and see GRUB. If not, there are some other settings in GRUB's configuration file you'll have to play with. You can choose Ubuntu to go with the default kernel, or you can go to 'Advanced options for Ubuntu' to choose your kernel and access recovery mode for any given kernel.\n", "Q: Change default wifi sort order By default, Ubuntu lists nearby wireless networks sorted alphabetically, regardless of the signal strength. \nHow can I set the list to be displayed in order of wi-fi signal power? \n\n\nA: This behaviour of network-manager-applet is by design and can't be changed.\nFrom the bugtracker:\n\nWe do understand that at the very first time you setup your computer\n  (or when you're travelling somewhere), there is a need to select\n  networks from a list (potentially fairly long) which is alphabetically\n  listed; however;\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*this is only for the first time you go to a specific location.

Any help on this would be really appreciated.\nEDIT:\nConnected via analog jack\nMy soundcard details are: \n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04) Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Device 81a7 Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 40 Memory at d20c0000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K] Capabilities: <access denied> Kernel driver in use: snd_hda_intel \n\n\nA: Yoour Sound settings image indicates that you have it set to use the digital S/PDIF connection. Change it and choose analog.\nIf your headphones have a Microphone attached, you will have 2 jacks, one input (pink) and one output (green). Open sound settings and plug in to the matching color starting with the output jack. You should get a headphones option to choose in the sound settings that looks like this:\n\nThe wires in these cables are very thin and flimsy. If you have an intermittant short in the wire or a poor connection you may find by wiggling it that the Headphones option appears and disappears from the Output tab.\nSwitching to the input tab allows for setting up the microphone (if present and attached).\n", "Q: ISO file is empty (no files or folders) I downloaded Fallout 3 iso file and mounted and there isn't any files or folders.

(for example ab12.14o, 70010340.09o). Which command I need to use?\nI tried ls *.o | wc but it doesn't work.\n\nA: Don't use ls. \nUse a shell array to store the name of the files ending in o:\nfiles=( *o )\n\nNow do:\necho \"${#files[@]}\"\n\nto get the number of files.\n@steeldriver has made a fair point, if you have no matching file names then the glob pattern will be taken literally. Because of this, even though there is no matching file names you will still get the file count as 1.\nTo overcome this set the nullglob or failglob shell option:\nshopt -s nullglob\nshopt -s failglob\n\n\nA: You probably just need to remove the .from your glob expression - which is causing it to only match files ending in .o rather than o\nHowever, a better way would be to use find:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -name '*o' -printf 'x' | wc -c\n\nYou can add -type f to limit it to plain files (exclude directories) and remove the -maxdepth 1 if you want to count recursively.\n", "Q: DOCKER installation error - libdevmapper1.02.1 (>= 2:1.02.99) According docker installation procedure on Ubuntu I got a problem:\nkp@maas:~$ sudo apt install docker-engine\nReading package lists...

How do you make a universal playlist from a directory of mp3 files?\nThis question came up as my wife is a musician (violinist) and she has a gig, and the DJ at the event will be playing her accompanying music for her. He told her to bring a thumbdrive with her music on it. She asked me to help her make a playlist. Since I don't know what sort of operating system the DJ has or will be using, I need a universal format, and I need to accomplish this without expending a great deal of effort.\nGoogling did not provide me with answers, even when I added Ask Ubuntu to the search.\nSo the question is:\nHow do you make a universal playlist from a directory of mp3 files?\n\nNote that after writing this up, I found How can I generate an M3U playlist from the terminal?, but the use-case is different (requiring a different answer as well), and the question being asked here is not aware of the existence of m3u.\n\nA: Shuffle Playlist\nBash script example for Pi Musicbox with USB HDD (generatePlaylist.sh)...\nfind /music/USB/mp3/* -iname *.mp3 -type f | shuf | head -n 200 > /music/playlists/mp3_shuffle.m3u\n\ncombined with crontab job to run every 4 hours...\n0 */4 * * *     root    /music/playlist/generatePlaylist.sh\n\n\nA: How to make a playlist from a directory of mp3 files?\ncd to the directory and \nls -1 *.mp3 > playlist.m3u\n\nIt turns out that there exists a fairly universal format called m3u format, and it can be as simple as a list of filenames separated by newlines. \nAfter my wife had moved the mp3 files she wanted onto an empty thumb drive, I opened a terminal, browsed to the media directory, and typed the following and hit enter:\nls -1 *.mp3 > playlist.m3u\n\nI then opened the file for her in gedit and let her copy and paste the lines around as much as she wanted to get them into her desired order. \nWhen she was done, she saved the file, double-clicked it in a folder browser, and RhythmBox opened it.

So I've read newer computers who ship with windows 8 and 10 are using UEFI. I want to dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu, I'm using a computer with Windows 10 installed but it originally had Windows 7, is it probably running UEFI? How do I find out if my OS is installed in UEFI mode?\n\nA: I got a laptop which has pre-installed Windows 8.1 and I am now using Ubuntu 14.04 with Windows 8.1 in dual boot mode.\nIf you are going to install Ubuntu 14.04 , I will say it is prefereable to install Ubuntu in (U)EFI mode because of problems specified in this thread.\nYou can find out which Boot mode you are using from these articles.\narticle1\narticle2\narticle3\nIf you still have doubt and open BIOS and find out which entries are listed in (U)EFI mode and legacy mode.\nUEFI mode:\n\nLegacy mode (option 3 is for windows OS):\n\n\nA: Yes, you should install in UEFI mode because of many advantages of it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Better security by helping to protect the pre-startup—or pre-boot—process against bootkit attacks. UEFI supports Secure Boot, a useful security feature that prevents malware from hijacking Windows or another installed operating system. Windows supports secure boot, but Linux machines are on their way to support secure boot too\n\n*Faster startup times and resuming from hibernation.\n\n*Support for drives larger than 2.2 terabytes (TB).\n\n\nFirst and most important for a desktop user is UEFI provides with GPT partition table which is better than older MBR. It allows you to make any practically any number of partitions where primary or extended.\n\nMBR works with disks up to 2 TB in size, but it can’t handle disks\n  with more than 2 TB of space. MBR also only supports up to four\n  primary partitions — if you want more, you have to make one of your\n  primary partitions an “extended partition” and create logical\n  partitions inside it. This is a silly little hack and shouldn’t be\n  necessary.\n\n\n\n*Support for modern, 64-bit firmware device drivers that the system can use to address more than 17.2 billion gigabytes (GB) of memory during startup.\n\n", "Q: Why do I get a train when I run 'ls'?

You can do this by tapping F2 when booting the computer as soon as you turn computer on. Some computers have different keys to enter boot sutch as ESC or F12. This can be different from manufacture to manufacture. If none of these keys work I would look at your manufacturers manual guide.\n\nA: Will Ubuntu boot correctly? If so, you need to check if the Windows 8 partition still exists. That should show as a volume in the NTFS file system in the Ubuntu file manager (installation usually sets up to automount the windows partition). The file /etc/fstab should also show the mount points created during installation, and that should show the Windows partition.\nIf the Windows partition still exists, then the suggestion from Zacharee1 to type in 'sudo update-GRUB' in a terminal should solve the problem. \nIf, however the Windows partition is not present, Ubuntu installation may have overwritten the Window partition. This is more likely if partitioning was done automatically. Hope this helps Craig  \nWindows formats hard disks using the NTFS file system by default. Ubuntu will work with the EXT4 file system by default, but many other file system types can be chosen if working on creating partitions manually. When at the point in the install where partitions will be chosen (/,swap) there should be a partition that shows NTFS as the file system. THIS IS YOUR WINDOWS PARTITION AND SHOULD NOT BE CHOSEN FOR ANYTHING IN THIS INSTALL. You are wanting to install alongside this Windows partition.  Craig\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 15.04 on VirtualBox VM I'm taking a college course on Unix, and as part of that, I am trying to use a live USB of Ubuntu on my computer. My computer runs 64-bit Windows 7. I used LinuxLive to install VirtualBox on a 16 GB flash drive. I had trouble installing 64-bit Ubuntu 15.04 using this, but was able to successfully install 32-bit 15.04. My ultimate goal: keep my Windows installation, and primarily run Ubuntu through the VM (possibly booting to it occasionally).\nI've been using running the \"Try Linux\" option for the last couple weeks, but from what I've read, I think I can \"install\" Linux on my flash drive to keep my settings (and possibly make it run faster in the VM?). I found a couple walkthrough videos on YouTube, but the screens I see are a little different. After the \"download updates\" checkbox screen, I get a dropdown menu which asks to set the device boot loader. The only option is /dev/sda, and trying to add a different option doesn't seem to work.\nI'm nearly a complete Unix n00b, and not ashamed to admit it. I get that /dev/sda is a drive, but which drive? Is it my computer's hard drive, my flash drive, or some virtual drive in the VM? If I install Ubuntu there, will it negatively impact my existing hard drive and Windows installation?\n\nA: Virtual hard drives\nWhile installing Ubuntu to a virtual machine such as Virtual Box you will have created a virtual hard drive for holding the virtualised OS and its data. For the host OS this virtual hard drive is just a file on the real hard drive but the guest operating system can use it as if it was a real drive to partition and to format it to the guest's needs. This will leave partitions and filesystem on the real drive untouched.\nWindows devices\nIn Windows hard drives or their partitions are assigned with letters A: B: C:, ... irrespective of where that partitions reside. This is different in Unix and in Ubuntu.\nDevice files of Unix and Ubuntu\nFor each attached block devices (and also for each virtual hard drive in a VM) we will create a device file. Modern SCSI or SATA drives will be named as /dev/sd followed by a letter depending on the sequence they were registered. Hence the first registered drive's device file will be named /dev/sda, the second /dev/sdb, the third /dev/sdc, and so forth.\nAfter we had added partitions on that drive they will consecutively be numbered /sda1, /sda2, /sda3, .... Therefore we can easily see on which hard drive a given partition sits.\nGrub and the boot device\nNow for installing the master boot loader (Grub) needed for booting Ubuntu we can further specify on which drive it should be installed. This only matters in case you have more than one drive attached to your computer (or your virtual machine).\nIn your case you likely had created only one virtual hard drive (though more are possible) which then was named /dev/sda. This drive is where you want to install Grub, and the OS.\nNote that in a virtual machine this still is a virtual hard drive, not your bare metal drive where your host OS resides.\nA word on dual boot\nOn a real computer where we may want to choose from more than one OS we may have to take care that the boot loader is really being placed onto the first bootable drive. It will replace any other (e.g. Windows) master boot  record that was there before we started. Only then a dual-boot system with a choice of operating systems at boot would be possible. If for any reasons we do not want this we can tell Grub to install on another drive (or partition), if available.\n\nA: I have a laptop that boots up into Windows 7.\nI often run Ubuntu inside a virtual machine on that laptop.\nThere are two key things that need to be downloaded and installed to get Ubuntu running inside a virtual machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Virtualbox application \".exe\" installer into your Windows Downloads folder. Then install the VirtualBox application (or some other virtual machine) on the host OS -- in your and my case, we're installing \"Virtualbox for Windows hosts\" on a Window 7 host OS. Wikibooks: VirtualBox / Installation / Windows has more details.\n\n*Download the Ubuntu \".iso\" image file into your Windows Downloads folder. Then run VirtualBox, tell it to create a new virtual machine and boot that virtual machine from that \".iso\" image, and inside that virtual machine install Ubuntu. Wikibooks: VirtualBox/Setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine has step-by-step instructions.\n\n\nAfter you get Ubuntu installed and rebooted a few times, you can delete those downloaded files from your Windows Downloads folder.\nI never needed a USB flash drive during the initial installation or while running Ubuntu as the guest operating system inside a virtual machine.\nHonestly, I have no idea what you mean by \"I used LinuxLive to install VirtualBox on a 16 GB flash drive.\"\nI'm assuming there are a bunch of typos in that sentence.\n(I've seen people who wanted to completely erase the hard drive of some computer and install Linux on it. Making a \"LiveUSB\" bootable USB flash drive so they can \"Try Ubuntu\" is a good first step in that direction, but it sounds like that's not what you want to do).\n(I've seen people download the \"VirtualBox for Ubuntu hosts\", so they can run some other operating system inside a virtual machine on their Ubuntu host computer, but it sounds like that's not what you want to do).\nNormally I see my normal Windows taskbar on the screen, and a big window with a title bar that shows the name of that virtual machine followed by \"- Oracle VM VirtualBox\". I run all kinds of Linux apps inside that window.\nNext to that big window, I see a separate little window with a title bar that shows \"Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager\".\nIn that little window, I click on the name of the virtual machine, then I click on \"Settings\", then I click on Storage\" to get the Storage Tree view.\nIf you accepted all the defaults (such as by following the above step-by-step instructions), by default there's only one \"disk\" in that storage tree, and when I click on it I see that it is actually a file located in my \"C:\\Users\\dc\\VirtualBox VMs\\\" folder.\nThat file is what the Ubuntu OS inside my virtual machine sees as the \"/dev/sda\" hard drive.\nSo what is /dev/sda?\nWhen running Ubuntu, \"/dev/sda\" is what Ubuntu thinks is the computer's hard drive.\nWhen I see people boot Ubuntu from their hard drive so it fills the entire screen (i.e., Ubuntu is actually running directly on the physical hardware), \"/dev/sda\" is the actual physical hard drive.\nWhen I see people boot Ubuntu from a live USB flash drive so it fills the entire screen (i.e., Ubuntu is actually running directly on the physical hardware), they see both a \"/dev/sda\" and a \"/dev/sdb\".\nI can never remember which one is the actual physical hard drive and which one is the actual physical live USB flash drive.\n(Asking how you can tell one from the other would make an excellent separate question).\nWhen Ubuntu is running inside a \"...- Oracle VM VirtualBox\" window, \"/dev/sda\" inside that window is whatever the virtual machine is using to simulate a virtual hard drive. What Ubuntu sees as \"/dev/sda\", when that Ubuntu is running inside a virtual machine on a Windows host, is usually a \".vdi\" file in some folder on the C:\\ hard drive somewhere. I hear that occasionally some people change those settings so that what Ubuntu sees as \"/dev/sda\", VirtualBox can remap to some physical hard drive or USB stick rather than the default \".vdi\" file. You can find out exactly what that is on your system by checking the settings in the \"Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager\".\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu from another version of ubuntu?

Missing a step? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: To boot from a USB and then launch a live session of Ubuntu from your USB, you have to go into your BIOS and change your settings to first boot from USB  (Or you can select USB to boot from by entering the one-time boot selection). This will boot from a USB if there are any mounted, and then switch to booting from your hard drive into Grub. Grub will not show the USB as an option to boot from. Booting into BIOS or into the One-Time Boot Menu is typically some key like F2, F12, ESC, or anywhere in between. You can search in the manual for your computer to find the key, or you can look online for your model. If you want, you can post information on your computer model here and I can do the research for you.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 15.04 Live USB hangs in both live mode and when installing on Acer Aspire E5-573G-56RG laptop Xubuntu 15.04 Live USB hangs in both live mode and when installing on Acer Aspire E5-573G-56RG laptop\nI've been using this USB drive to install a couple flavors of Ubuntu on a couple systems without issue, except for when I try it on this laptop.  However, I was able to create a Windows 10 installation USB on it and it worked fine, so it's certainly possible to boot from this USB drive on this system.  I'd like to dual-boot with Windows 10 and Xubuntu.\nBooting in UEFI mode with Secure Boot on/off:\nI can get to grub and choose live mode or install, but immediately after picking one the LED on the USB drive stops flashing and the screen is just black (still on, just displaying black) and nothing happens, even if I leave it alone for a really long time.  Turning on nomodeset doesn't change anything.  Windows Fast Startup is disabled, and there's no Intel Smart Response Technology either (trying to troubleshoot using these guidelines).\nBooting in legacy mode:\nStarts out fine, I get the splash screen then the install starts, but gets stuck at [    0.174664] pci 0000:00:14.0: can't find IRQ for PCI INT A; probably a buggy MP table after a bunch of lines in the same format (stops at same line every time).\n\nNow, I've worked around this before by taking the hard drive out of the laptop and plugging it into another system when I wanted to use the live USB, but I find this makes things a bit finicky and usually makes some sort of boot repair necessary, so I'd like to avoid that (also taking apart a laptop is a bit time consuming).\n\nEDIT\nSo I popped the laptop open and put the SSD into my desktop (disconnected the other drives so the Windows 10 partition wouldn't mess with them like it did the last time I did this).  My live USB drive worked perfectly on the desktop and I was able to install Xubuntu 15.04 alongside the existing Windows 10 partition.  I tested grub by rebooting a few times and booting into each partition with no problems.\nHowever, as soon as I put the drive back in the laptop I could only boot into Windows 10 (BIOS/UEFI only ever showed \"Windows Boot Manager\" in my boot options and grub never started).  I'm guessing grub configured itself for my desktop and its hardware/UEFI, and it won't work on my laptop without some changes.\nAlso, I noticed there seem to be a lot of threads out there regarding laptops with switchable graphics (like this one).  Any chance that's the root of my issue here?  I've never really worked with linux for an extended period of time before.\nAt this point I've mostly given up on installing linux on the laptop, but would like to see if anyone has been able to figure something like this out before.\n\nA: Tried again after giving up for a couple years and found the solution: BIOS version was bugged and wouldn't allow any Linux versions to boot.  Both upgrading and downgrading the BIOS fixed the problem.\nAdditionally, it was necessary to enter BIOS and in the Security tab enter \"Select an UEFI file as trusted for executing:\" and find grubx64.efi (for me it was in HDD0/EFI/ubuntu/)\nIn the end it works in UEFI mode with Secure Boot enabled, dual booting Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10.\n", "Q: How do I view non matching files only in fdupes?

I've created a test branch which now has this option (https://github.com/SeeSpotRun/rmlint/tree/feature/uniques).\nIf you want to try it out, you will need to install as follows:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dependencies if you don't already have them:\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install git scons python3-sphinx python3-nose gettext build-essential\n$ sudo apt-get install libelf-dev libglib2.0-dev libblkid-dev libjson-glib-1.0 libjson-glib-dev\n\n\n\n*Grab the test branch source:\n\n\n$ cd ~\n$ git clone -b feature/uniques https://github.com/SeeSpotRun/rmlint.git\n$ cd rmlint/\n\n\n\n*Compile and (optionally) install:\n\n\n$ scons config\n$ scons DEBUG=1 -j4\n$ sudo scons DEBUG=1 -j4 --prefix=/usr install\n$ # (if you skip the install step then replace 'rmlint' with './rmlint' below)\n\n\n\n*Find unique files (will not delete anything):\n\n\n$ # this will display unique files on your screen:\n$ rmlint -o uniques path/to/your/files\n$ # or use either of the following to write a list of unique files to unique.txt:\n$ rmlint -o uniques:unique.txt path/to/your/files\n$ rmlint -o uniques path/to/your/files > unique.txt\n\nIf you want a list of files in dir2 that don't have a twin in dir1 you can tag dir2 using // as a separator and add -k (or --keep-all-tagged) to the command:\n\n$ rmlint -k -o uniques dir1 // dir2\n\n(Note that if there are two identical files in dir2, but they don't have a copy in dir1, they will still get listed as \"unique\" in the last example)\n\n\n*Let us know how it went.\nAny problems or suggestions either reply here or at our issues log\n\nBe aware that in the above examples, if you have two files with different names but the same content, they will not be flagged as unique.  If you do want them to be flagged as unique, add -b or --match-basename to the command line.\nRegarding md5 sums etc: rmlint uses SHA-1 by default, which is about 4 billion times stronger than md5.  You can upgrade this to SHA-512 by adding -p to the command line, or you can do a byte-by-byte comparison instead by adding -pp (although this chews up a bit more RAM).\n", "Q: Laptop built-in monitor not detected, dual GPU The built-in monitor of my laptop seems to be not recognized by Ubuntu.

I am pretty much a noob. \nPPS :\nI am running Xubuntu 15.04.\nTIA. \n\nA: *\n\n*py2 and py3 are usually found side by side and like I discovered better left for the system to pick which version it needs. If you want to use any version then you have to point whatever app you are using to the version you want.\n\n*Running \"python\" will always run the 2.X version, but running \"python3\" or \"python2\" will give you the respective versions.\n\n*Run following commands in terminal: \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python\n\n*Another solution will be to use the dpkg since this doesn't depend on\npython, but requires more effort go here for this option. This will mean you will download all required packages. Hope it Helps.\n", "Q: Is it possible to repair sd card? I have done pretty much everything I guess.

I've been running from the external drive for a while and have already setup another user and installed software on the external drive installation.  I would now like to move this installation to my internal hard drive.  I reran the Ubuntu installer on the internal drive and already have the new ext4 partition with fresh Ubuntu install (maybe an unnecessary step).  Now I want the external drive installation copied to that internal drive partition. \nMy understanding is that, if I want the clone to be bootable, dd can only be used to copy from device to device and not partition to partition, or what I believe I need to do in my case would be device (external USB drive) to partition (ext4 partition on internal drive).  Looking at the Clonezilla documentation, it appears to have a similar limitation.  So maybe cloning is not what I need to do.  I really just want to get the additional user and all updates, changes, and installations copied over to the internal drive installation, so what is the best way to do this?\n\nA: I still think clonezilla is the way to go it has option to copy and restore partitions usb/internal dosent matter as long as ubuntu was running just format the partition where you wanna install ubuntu same as where it is installed .Or you can make a custom distro with all your apps and files.

(Using SSH Rescue Env.) I have a Remote Dedicated Server with no Online control panel to resize partitions after initial OS install, so I am using the debian based rescue environment to manipulate the partitions unmounted. Problem is, I am a bit stupid when it comes to Partition manipulation on remote drives, I have tried using GNU Parted command line tool, since GParted isn't an option, and fdisk is useless since the drive is formatted with GPT, only to find out the resize command has been removed as of version 2.4. So, Below is a list of my partitions from the print command of parted:\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system     Name     Flags\n1      20.5kB  1049kB  1029kB                  primary  bios_grub\n2      2097kB  21.0GB  21.0GB  ext4            primary\n3      21.0GB  2000GB  1979GB  ext4            primary\n4      2000GB  2000GB  536MB   linux-swap(v1)  primary\n\nWhat I need to figure out, is how to shrink #3 to about 1.2TB and then expand the #2 to fill what was moved when #3 was shrunk. My #2 Partition is full, and the #3 partition has space to spare.\n\nA: Doing what you want might or might not be possible, depending on what is (and must be) currently mounted, and whether you can boot from some other medium to work around mount problems. Factors to consider here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always keep in mind the distinction between a partition (a simple data structure that defines the start and end point of a chunk of disk space, typically along with other things like a type code) and a filesystem (a more complex data structure that's held within a partition or another container, such as an LVM's logical volume). If you don't already fully understand this distinction, stop now and research it.\n\n*You can increase the size of a mounted ext2/3/4 filesystem, but AFAIK you cannot decrease the size of a mounted ext2/3/4 filesystem. The resize2fs utility does this job from the command line.\n\n*To resize a partition, you may have to delete the partition and create a new one in its place. The start and end points may need to be specified with sector-level precision, which parted does not provide by default. You need to set unit s to get this; or you can use gdisk, which provides sector-level precision by default. (Even gdisk, though, automatically aligns partitions to 2048-sector values by default, so you may need to adjust alignment with the d option on the experts' menu.)\n\n*Filesystem-resize operations typically leave the start point of the filesystem unchanged. Thus, if you need to move the start point of a partition, you must do so by using dd or some other tool to move the entire contents of the filesystem. Depending on the direction of the movement, this may need to be done before or after you delete the original partition, and the new one may need to be created before or after the move. If the move operation overlaps the original location, you must be very careful about how you do this, lest you destroy some partition data!\n\n*Be very careful about partition and filesystem end points. If you shrink a filesystem and then re-create a new partition that's just a little too small, you can end up trashing important data. I recommend shrinking the filesystem smaller than you intend, creating a new partition, and then using resize2fs to grow the filesystem to the size of the new surrounding partition. This procedure minimizes the chances of getting a size mis-match.\n\n*Remember that you may need to reboot after you change the partition table to get the kernel to use the new table.\n\n\nBecause of these issues, attempting to do what you want without the help of GParted or some other tool designed to coordinate partition and filesystem changes can be extremely risky. It can be done, but one slip-up in specifying a sector value can leave you with a disk that's totally worthless. The fact that you're asking for help about this makes me wary about suggesting you even make the attempt; the risk of trashing a production system is just too great for somebody who's never before done this sort of thing. If you have no other option, I strongly recommend you re-create your server locally and practice on the copy before you try it on your remote server.\nYou might want to consider some alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use GParted -- If you can boot from an external medium, you can use GParted. You say this is a remote server. Many such systems provide a BMC that enables you to attach virtual USB drives and see a virtual console via a Java applet. Using this feature will be extremely slow, but should enable you to run GParted and make your changes much more easily and safely.\n\n*Create additional partitions -- You may be able to shrink one partition and then, rather than move and grow the other, create a new partition. You'd then move data from a subdirectory to the new partition and mount it in place of that subdirectory. This approach basically splits the difference; you must still shrink one partition, but you avoid the need to do the more dangerous and difficult move operation.\n\n*Use symlinks -- You may be able to accomplish your goals by splitting off some files from your too-full partition to the less-full one and then using symbolic links to make them accessible on their desired paths. This is likely to be the safest approach.\n\n*Reinstall -- If you have adequate backup, you could back up the system, re-install with a better setup, and restore your original data.\n\n*Do it on-site -- If you have physical access to your servers, or if you've got on-site help, you (or your help) can do it in person much as you would with a desktop system, using an Ubuntu installation USB flash drive. Depending on how important this is and where the server is relative to you, it might even be worth a trip to do the job.\n\n*Add a disk -- You might consider adding a disk, if that's an option, and moving some of your data to it.\n\n\nIn the future, you might want to consider using Logical Volume Management (LVM), which makes these sorts of manipulations much simpler and safer. LVM has a significant learning curve, but once you've got the basics down, it helps a lot because you need not worry about moving partitions; filesystems are stored like files in a filesystem, so once you shrink one, you can expand another into the free space without changing the start point. LVM also helps you add space in the form of new disks.\n\nA: As a temporary fix, from an article I read. It seemed that %70 of the space being used was coming from the webserver, specifically /var/www. so what I did was:\ncd /var\nmv www /home\nln -s /home/www www\nll\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root      9 Oct 18 12:33 www -> /home/www/\n\nLike I said, A temporary fix, but my root directory is now only %30 full instead of %100. so, until I can resize the partitions, this will work.\n", "Q: Ubuntu failing to boot past GRUB - \"Kernel panic\" So I've been working today on developing a LFS system, I'm developing the system using a VirtualBox VM running Ubuntu. \nI got to this page, and after running the make install command for Glibc the virtualbox was slow, and some basic commands like cp where acting weird (it was saying \"Segmentation fault (core dumped)\") so I decided to restart the VB. \nAfter selecting Ubuntu in the GRUB menu, I was presented by this awesome(not) error dump:\n\nCan you guys tell me what this means, and maybe how to fix my VM?\nEDIT 1:\nIt also throws the same error when attempting to boot into recovery mode. \nI did accidentally run a chmod command on the wrong partition, but I don't think it would cause this.

The result is often filesystem corruption or an inability to mount shared partitions (including the EFI System Partition, or ESP) from non-Windows OSes.\nIf disabling Fast Startup doesn't do the job by itself, then I recommend you run a filesystem check on the ESP, as oldfred suggests.\n\nA: Don't know if this will help much, but, when i tried to install ubuntu on a machine that had windows 7 already, I first also tried to create a \"ext4\" partition manually.

But just earlier, I discovered that the process kidle_inject is causing all this troubles. (Upon researching, I believe this was a \"feature\" of intel_pstate).  \nWhile I understand that this does this to keep my computer/processor cool, this very affects almost everything I do that uses much processing power. For example, I'm playing Minecraft and when the processor goes on a certain limit (I don't know what % it is), this kidle_inject processes kicks in (I believe it generates one for every CPU cores I have) and instead of helping with really keeping my computer cool, this makes things worse.  \nThis is what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*For example I'm playing Minecraft, and like I said on a certain % of CPU usage, several kidle_inject processes are spawned (4 on me cause I have 4 CPU cores).\n\n*Upon spawning of these processes, my CPU usage on my System Monitor Indicator skyrockets to constant 95%-100% which causes very severe lag on my computer.\n\n*When this happens, I only resort to opening a tty session. (I just recently knew about this and I still don't know what they are really called). Typing the top command there exposes that those kidle_inject processes eats up at least 60% CPU on each of them, while other processes are low on about 2%-5% only. And that's how I knew that these were the culprit of my computer's severe lag.  \n\n\nI haven't tested yet because I just knew about this earlier, but many times ago, I tried playing Super Tux Kart too (the newest release) and also got those very high CPU % as well plus audio stuttering, and I also get 100% CPU when I just build a project in Android Studio which I believe shouldn't use too much CPU (and I got some settings to improve Gradle's performance too), that I believe this was the root cause too that time.  \nSo is disabling intel_pstate or intel_powerclamp (or maybe they go together?) my only way to solve this problem? Or maybe I can set when that kidle_inject processes are spawned? I've been reading some people that are getting problems with intel_pstate too but all of them (that I remember) are on 14.04 or 14.10 and I'm on Ubuntu 15.04 so I thought that maybe their problems are different than mine.  \nAll help is very much appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: kidle_inject is introduced by thermald and not by the intel_pstate CPU frequency scaling driver. Try disabling thermald. That being said, the intel_pstate driver does have issues, and so if troubles continue try disabling it also, such that you fall back to the acpi-cpufreq CPU scaling driver.

I plan to use Ubuntu server 14.04 with nginx and php. I know that it is generally safe not to run a server as root user but is it ok if I set it up to run as a normal user as opposed to run it as www-data? What are the potential security risks that comes with changing the user? Keep in mind that this is a simple server that can only be accessed within the private network in home.\n\nA: \nis it ok if I set it up to run as a normal user as opposed to run it as www-data? \n\nSure. \n\nWhat are the potential security risks that comes with changing the user? \n\nThere are no risks to changing a user. If anything changing to another user (that is NOT your admin account since you never should use that except for admin tasks on a server) will make it more secure: anyone knows there can be a user www-data when there is a website active. Now they need to guess that user name too. Setting a good password is more important.\nIt is not the user but the permissions set to the directories and the files that can make it risky. If you set permissions to files and directory all open for all it is riskier than when you set them as strict as possible. For someone to execute arbitrary code that person needs to be able to execute code. So set files to 644 or even 640 if possible and directories to 755 or 750 if possible and have the users that need to be allowed to edit files all in the same group. \n", "Q: Google Chrome won't launch on a Pentium 4 Google Chrome won't launch. \nWhenever I try to launch it, \ngoogle-chrome-stable \n\nI get,\nIllegal instruction (core dumped)\n\n(I have already taken a look at,\n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/questions/515177/google-chrome-wont-launch\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/questions/616949/google-chrome-wont-launch\n\n*Google Chrome Won't Open\nNo help. \nYes, majority of these are closed.

More precisely, command -v prints the command that is executed by Bash. If it's a builtin, it will simply print the command since there is no location of a binary. If it's an alias, it will print the alias definition.\n\n*You may use whereis. It prints the location of the binary, source and man pages. From the manpage\n\n[...]whereis then attempts to locate the desired program in a list of standard Linux places. \n\nIf you need the location of the binary only use\nwhereis -b <your_file>\n\n\n*locate is another option. It searches an index database of files on your system and is therefor much faster than find which truly searches the file system. The database is normally updated regularly via cronjob(daily?), but an update can be triggered with updatedb to keep up with recent changes.\n\n*Well, find of course. \nfind / -name <your_file>\n\nthough that may take quite some time.

Because I messed with a lot of settings in different combinations, I formatted the computer and installed Ubuntu all over again.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: The problem is one of 3 things.  It's either a hardware/device issue, a networking stack issue, or a DNS issue.\nThe hardest to identify is a device issue, so lets consider that last.  \nThe easiest to diagnose is a networking issue.  During an outage: Try running ifconfig in a console.  It should show a configured device with an IP address.  At the very least you should be able to ping that, thus you can generate packets.\nRun route to see what your default Gateway is, and try pinging that.  If there is no default gateway, or you can't ping the default gateway, that's your problem there.  If you can, then try pinging 109.193.193.109 and if that fails (ICMP echo could be blocked on your network, like it is on mine), try visiting http://109.193.193.109 in a browser.  If that works, it's most likely a DNS issue.  \nDNS Issues:  Try or ping www.google.co.uk (if dnsutils isn't installed).  It should present an IP address.  In my case it's 216.58.219.99.  If it doesn't, you'll need nslookup/dig (from the dnsutils package) to diagnose.  nslookup will tell you the Server Address, and hence tell you which DNS server is supposedly serving your requests.  If it's not working, you may have a badly configured system, or a broken DNS server.  I would suggest you try installing a local DNS server (install package bind9 and setup 127.0.0.1 as your DNS server), or try re-configuring NetworkManager.  I've found it nothing but trouble.  \nAs for device issues. If the appropriate device appears in ifconfig , then it's probably not going to be a device problem that you can fix, but judging from what you said above, I doubt it's a device problem, unless it's as silly as a bad cable/connector in your computer/router, but I have had issues with the Raspberry Pi, which turned out to be sufficient power on the board to run the device and detect it, but not enough to interrogate (running ifconfig resulted in a device failure).  \n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 over Ubuntu, partition problem I installed Ubuntu about 2 months ago, and now with so many problems i've decides to go back to the old Windows 7. \nMy problem is, that when i installed Ubuntu on my new HDD, i made the whole partition as ext4 so i can't install Windows. So how i can now partition that thing in to NTFS?\nI'm doing it via USB. Here's the picture from GParted. (http://postimg.org/image/e70h9lzad/)\n\nA: What you're attempting is similar to trying to pick out the engine of a car while it is running.  \nTo install another operating system: Make sure to boot the new (other OS) installation media and handle the re-partitioning from there.\n\nA: You need to boot from your live Ubuntu, you cannot change the root partition otherwise!

That is why using:\nSystem Settings -> Brightness & Lock does not work with Gnome Shell on Ubuntu 14.04. It does with unity of course.\nFor gnome shell you need to search for Start-up Applications and create a new application with the following command:\n/usr/bin/gnome-screensaver\n\nThat's all. Now System Settings-> Brightness & Lock will work after a reboot or login / logout.\nThe above will just switch off and or lock the screen depending on settings made.

I am currently studying iptables and ufw on Ubuntu server. While playing with them I came across an ambiguity about the true nature of the ufw.\nHere is the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I run sudo ufw status in terminal, the output is Status: inactive. \n\n*But when I run sudo service ufw status the output is ufw start/running. \nAlso ufw does not appear in the services list when I run service --status-all. \nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is ufw a service? \n\n\n*\n\n*If yes, why it does not appear in the services list?\n\n*If no, why the terminal answers when I ask about it's status as a service?\n\n\n*What is the difference between sudo ufw status and sudo service ufw status? And why I get different outputs for them?\n\n\nA: ufw is an uncomplicated configuration tool for firewalls.  It is designed to be usable by people who have no experience with firewalls or want an uncomplicated way to modify the underlying iptables and netfilter rulesets.\nFor example:\nufw allow all port 22 traffic (UDP and TCP):\nufw allow 22\n\niptables allow port 22 traffic (UDP and TCP):\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\nComparatively, ufw permits users to modify the basic firewall needs with limited knowledge of iptables or such.\nIt in and of itself only modifies iptables / netfilter rules when 'enabled'.  It does not run as its own process, in that sense, because the rules it applies are updated on the fly; I am fairly certain it doesn't continue to 'run'.\nThe only way I would consider ufw to be a service is in that, at boot time, it may be able to restore whatever rules are defined in it.  However, iptables-persistent does the same thing, and is not really a service, therefore I do not consider ufw a service, as such, as to determine if ufw (that is, the actual firewall rules) are being enforced is with ufw status.\nAs per the Community Help Documentation on ufw, it says nothing about ufw being a service, which seems to support this.\nAnd through testing, I have confirmed that ufw is just a less complicated way to 'configure' firewall rules - the real magic of ufw is that it sets up iptables / netfilter rules which you can then see with iptables -L when ufw is enabled.\n\nA: *\n\n*As far as the Ubuntu documentation, ufw is an application that is running as a system service.\n\n*No.2 question is simple....\nThe two mentioned commands are quite different:\n\n\n*\n\n*ufw status shows only if the firewall filtering is active, to enable it type sudo ufw enable.\n\n*service ufw status shows only if the service itself is operating.\n\n\n", "Q: Can I configure dhclient to execute a bash script after a successful DHCP renewal? I'm still new to Ubuntu, and just installed Ubuntu-server 14.04.3 LTS.  I've signed up for dynamic dns and opted to use a bash script by updating my ip address on the dynamic dns website's exposed REST API through a simple wget command.  I plan to just execute the bash script after a dhclient (DHCP) renewal, but I don't know how to configure dhclient to do such a thing.\nThanks,\n\nA: I've found a solution to my problem.  man dhclient states that a script is invoked by dhclient when it gets a lease.  Further reading of man dhclient-script and the actual script itself describes the location of scripts that dhclient executes depending on the phase of the dhcp process.\nThe hooks are located in /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d and /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d directories for before and after dhclient execution.  Since I'm interested in executing a script after a successful renewal, I placed my script inside the ...-enter-hooks.d directory.\nHere's the script, checking for the particular phases which signify a new dhcp ip address before executing the dynamic dns script:\ncase \"$reason\" in\n\n    BOUND|RENEW|REBIND|REBOOT)\n        sh /etc/network/rinker.sh\n        ;;\n\nesac\n\nI got rinker.sh from http://www.changeip.com/accounts/downloads.php?action=displaycat&catid=4, which is just a simple wget call to the website's update URL.\n\nA: I'd like to follow up to Poly Bug's answer.\nWhen calling the external script I have found IF you use the 'sh' it 'source' before calling the script dhclient will treat that as \"part of its hook\".  As a result it will give you errors like this:\n[[: not found\nIf you have if / then statements within the script you are calling it will end up in failure of the hook script you intended to run.\nInstead, remove the sh and run your dhclient-exit-hook script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n# dhclient is picky about how it runs sub-scripts.\n# using this way allows divorces it from the hook itself so it runs independently of the hook\n/SM/data-drive/sm_scripts/network/dhclient-resolv-set $0 $BASH_SOURCE $reason &\n\nThis will run your called script in an asynchronous manner without errors.\nI have also created a video follow up based on this post:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4lU7IuUUto\n", "Q: how i can know my graphics card memory size?

Is it because it uses the current bash session to run it so it works like typing bash file? \nAlso, along similar lines. I know that typing > file deletes the contents of a file. But why? I understand this sends the standard input to a file. But isn't the standard input the keyboard? So shouldn't I go to a new line in theory and type things? I don't understand. \n\nA: First of all . file does not execute the file, it sources it. That might sounds like a pedantic point but there is an important difference. When you execute a file, it is run in its own subshell; any variables defined in it, for example, will not be propagated to the parent session. To illustrate, consider this script (foo.sh) that simply sets a variable and then prints it:\nfoo=\"bar\"\necho \"In the script, foo is $foo\"\n\nNow, let's set the variable foo to something, then run that script and, once it is finished, echo $foo:\n$ foo=\"baz\" \n$ bash foo.sh \nIn the script, foo is bar\n$ echo $foo\nbaz\n\nAs you can see, $foo was set inside the script but that did not change the value of the variable in the parent shell. Contrast the above with what happens if we source the script instead:\n$ . foo.sh \nIn the script, foo is bar\n$ echo $foo\nbar\n\nThis time, because the script was sourced, the variable was also change in the parent shell.\n\nThe > file is simpler. The > operator opens a file (or creates it if it doesn't exist) for writing and immediately overwrites anything already in the file. Therefore, if you just run > file with nothing else, the > will empty the file if it exists. \n\nA: Avoid to ask two unrelated questions in the same post.\n1: it doesn't exactly work like bash file because the latter run a new shell while . uses the same current shell. It works like source file.\n2: The default standard input is indeed normally the keyboard but with running > file, there is no command to run. The shell just process the redirections then ends processing the (missing) command. What you describe would have been cat > file.\n", "Q: Remote Desktop Secutity I'm learning how to remote desktop from my Ubuntu machine to my Debian machine. I'm using Remmina and VNC. One problem I have is that the security is weak. To enable remote desktop on Debian I went to System > Sharing > (double clicked) screen sharing, and configured the settings as shown below. This allowed me to connect to the computer. However, the password text box will only allow you to type an 8 character password. My question is, how do I I increase this character limit? And secondly, why doesn't this work on a user/password model. It seems any non-local user to the Debian machine can login with this password.\n\n\nA: AFAIK the 8-character password limit is part of the VNC protocol - some implementations allow the user to set a longer password, however the protocol only considers the first 8 characters. \nTo secure VNC properly, you should tunnel the session over SSH and have the VNC server only listen on the localhost interface, either in its own setup (e.g. adding a -localhost option) or by means of a firewall (or both). That way, both the password challenge/response AND the actual VNC traffic will be encrypted. \nThe Remmina VNC client has support for SSH tunneling built in - with other clients, you may need to set up the tunnel via a separate SSH terminal session.\n", "Q: Why is my npm install having an error?

When I first installed it, I partitioned ~100GB for Ubuntu and left the rest to Windows (I might've messed up the partitioning.). Now when I try to boot Windows 8, the Windows Boot Manager tells me it has failed. \nSpecifically:\nWindows Boot Manager  \nWindows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.  \nTo fix the problem:\n\n  1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer. \n  2. Choose your language settings, and then click \"Next.\"\n  3. Click \"repair your computer.\"\n\nIf you don't have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer\nmanufacturer for assistance. \n\n  File: \\Boot\\BCD  \n\n  Status: 0xc0000001  \n\n  Info: The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors.\nAny tips on how to fix this? I'm going to try to repair it with the installation disk, but I'm worried that some of my data won't be able to be recovered.\n\nA: You've got a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode Ubuntu installation alongside an EFI/UEFI-mode Windows installation. As you've discovered, this combination is not good. You probably got to this point because you followed misguided installation instructions that suggested you enable the CSM (aka \"legacy boot support\") in your firmware. This causes more problems than it solves, as described in greater detail on this page of mine. To fix the problem, I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from the rEFInd image.\n\n*Enter your firmware setup utility. You typically do this by hitting Del, Enter, or a function key soon after powering on the computer (about when you'd press F12 to get the firmware's built-in boot manager that you're using as a workaround).\n\n*Disable the CSM. This will produce a boot straight to Windows, once you reboot.\n\n*If it's currently enabled, disable Secure Boot. You can re-enable it later, if you like.\n\n*Insert the rEFInd medium and reboot into it. (You may need to use your F12 key.)\n\n*rEFInd should show options to boot both Windows and Ubuntu. Test Windows first, then Ubuntu.\n\n*If you can boot both Windows and Ubuntu from rEFInd, then you can install an EFI-mode boot loader from Ubuntu. There are many options, but the two easiest are likely to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*rEFInd -- You can install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package to use it, bypassing GRUB. You know it works at this point, so it's a pretty safe choice; but if you want to use it with Secure Boot enabled, there will be more hoops to jump through later, as described here.\n\n*GRUB -- You can install the grub-efi package, which should replace the grub-pc package. You'll then have to re-install GRUB by typing sudo grub-install. You may also need to type sudo update-grub to get the configuration file right. This is a bit of a leap of faith, but if it doesn't work, you can use the rEFInd medium to boot up and try again. Alternatively, Boot Repair can usually get things working by re-installing GRUB automatically. One advantage of this approach is that you should be able to re-enable Secure Boot after you're done with no additional trouble.\n\n\n\nThere are numerous variants on this procedure. Most notably, if you're sure you want to stick with GRUB, you can skip using rEFInd and boot your Ubuntu installation medium in EFI mode and run Boot Repair from it, rather than use rEFInd to boot into your existing installation and repair it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 installation gets stuck at loading screen When I boot from the USB stick with Ubuntu 15.04 on it, I'm offered with the choice of trying Ubuntu or installing it directly.

If I view the source of this window, I get the correct html.\nAny ideas what might be causing this?\nsystem: Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: The main issue here is the lack of a proper HTML skeleton.\nFor HTML5:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"es\">\n\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n        <title>Title Page</title>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <h1 class=\"some-class\">Hello World</h1>\n        <p>\n           Fresh I'm king of the world do Vanilla Ice, Dolly the Sheep the Matrix Beavis and Butthead Umbro shorts tying your sweater around your waist. \n           Accent braids Ken Griffey Jr Honda Accord in Courtney Love I believe I can fly. \n           Tamagotchi Madonna hottie yo quiero Taco Bell Pontiac Trans Sport adipiscing.\n        </p>\n    </body>\n</html>\n\nCSS and JavaScript not included (and not necessary to render plain text).\nCheck this out:\nHTML !DOCTYPE Declaration\n\nA: What editor are you using? I once had some issues with an editor that didn't actually save as html.\nCan you run cat -v path/to/file.html to check out the proper file contents? It should be the exact same html you expect to work properly...\n\nA: Try installing xampp for ubuntu.\nThen move or create your html files that were not rendering to the /opt/lampp/htdocs and try to open them from there.\nYou will probably have permission issues creating files or folders there. Follow How to save projects file in htdocs to solve that issue.\nFinally on the part of changing ownership of that htdocs folder correct syntax is: \nchown -R USER:GROUP DIRECTORY e.g. sudo chown YourUserName:xamppusers /opt/lampp/htdocs\nI had earlier noted his syntax: sudo usermod -R root.xamppusers /opt/lampp/htdocs was not working or is incorrect.\nThat worked for me. And I am able to render html pages on chrome browser now.  \n", "Q: No wifi after upgrade to 15.04 , ethernet works fine Please find system log \nwifi worked fine in 14.04 LTS but not anymore after upgrade\nmany tx \n########## wireless info START ##########\n\nReport from: 18 Oct 2015 18:31 CEST +0200\n\nBooted last: 18 Oct 2015 17:59 CEST +0200\n\nScript from: 27 Sep 2015 00:34 UTC +0000\n\n##### release ###########################\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\n\n##### kernel ############################\n\nLinux 3.2.0-56-generic-pae #86-Ubuntu SMP Wed Oct 23 17:51:27 UTC 2013 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n\nParameters: ro, quiet, splash, vt.handoff=7\n\n##### desktop ###########################\n\nXubuntu\n\n##### lspci #############################\n\n00:19.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation 82577LM Gigabit Network Connection [8086:10ea] (rev 05)\n    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device [103c:7008]\n    Kernel driver in use: e1000e\n\n43:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6200 [8086:4239] (rev 35)\n    Subsystem: Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6200 2x2 AGN [8086:1311]\n    Kernel modules: iwlwifi\n\n##### lsusb #############################\n\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0020 Intel Corp.

Why did it happen? Did it get wrong with my assumption of getting the package completely un-installed? If yes, how can I remove it completely?\n\nA: The package is completely uninstalled, but your system is configured by default so that the downloaded DEB files will not be deleted after an installation.\nTherefore start \nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nto delete packages that can no longer be downloaded, or\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nto delete all downloaded packages\n\nfrom man apt-get\nclean\n    clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files. It\n    removes everything but the lock file from /var/cache/apt/archives/ and\n    /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.\n\nautoclean\n    Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of retrieved\n    package files. The difference is that it only removes package files\n    that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless. This allows\n    a cache to be maintained over a long period without it growing out of\n    control. The configuration option APT::Clean-Installed will prevent\n    installed packages from being erased if it is set to off.\n\n\nA: After the purge operation the package is effectively uninstalled. The isn't any file from the package usable by your system. The reason you could install it again, is because apt will cache any package downloaded from the repositories, to prevent redownloads of the same package, wasting mirrors bandwidth. The package cache resides in /var/cache/apt/archives.\nIf you are a Windows user, an equivalent behavior is: downloading an installer, then unplugging the network cable and then installing the software.\n", "Q: How do I install Canon LBP2900B printer in UBUNTU Everything done as instructed in the given URL,\nHow To Install Canon LBP2900B printer in 14.04 LTS ?

First, run\naplay -l | grep card\n\nThis should list the devices alsa can see.  Pulseaudio sits on top of alsa, so alsa needs to be able to see the device before pulseaudio can.  In my case, alsa was able to see my usb audio interface, but it was not showing up in the pulseaudio list correctly.\nThe next step is to run \ngksu gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nthis is the file that was escaping me for a while, and it essentially sets defaults for pulseaudio.  In order to get it to correctly see the card, go to the bottom of the file and append:\nload-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0\n\nhere, the 0 is replaced by whatever device number the card that is not appearing is.  Save the file and log out, then log back in and your device should appear in the list.\nI'm still not sure why alsa could see the device but pulseaudio could not, but this effectively adds the item to the list and allows you to run your usb audio interface without having to run QJackCtl.\n", "Q: How to find gaps in list?

But it seems I'm filling up the ssd partition quicker than I wanted as everything seems to be installed there.\nThis question is on the same topic but does not mention where applications are typically installed and does not suggest where to mount HDD for new applications to be installed there.\n\nA: When you set up your Ubuntu installation, you mentioned that you placed the root directory (/) on the SSD, and the home directory (/home) on the HDD.  This is a good start.  I actually recommend placing root on your SSD, as well as home, and then create a directory such as /mnt/data which is where you would put all of the data you wanted on your HDD.  With this setup, I can easily symlink stuff on the HDD to my SSD, such as video games and movies, while keeping my system as fast as possible.\nI'm not quite sure why you want what you're asking for, as I'd personally want system stuff to be on the SSD to increase speed, while putting my less-important stuff on the HDD, however you can accomplish this much like how you set up your installation in the first place.\nInstead of placing the home directory on the HDD, you could mount /usr/bin or even /usr.  This is the typical place you'd find apt installing binaries.\nBefore you take the time to do this, I'd highly recommend using baobab or something like it to figure out 100% where you're losing space.\nIf you'd like to separate both /home and /usr, you'd just have to split the HDD into two separate partitions.\nOther Ideas\nAs Barafu Albino added:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use apt-get clean regularly to remove unneeded packages and apt downloads\n\n*Think about using BTRFS with high compression as your filesystem\n\n*Refrain from multilib and debug (dbg) packages\n\n\nEdit\n10GB is probably very small for a desktop computer.  The only time I've seen something that small is when someone really breaks out all of the other mount points onto HDDs and stuff (maybe 20 ys ago) or on an embeded machine or something like a raspberry pi.\n", "Q: No boot option for Windows after Boot Repair I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.02.

I am trying to put all .js files in a directory and sub directories into a single file in lexical order. I have tried:\ngrep -r --include=*.js * > dir/.filename \n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nA: You can use find to find the files and then sort to sort the names:\nfind . -type f -name '*.js' | sort \n\nTo save the names in a file:\nfind . -type f -name '*.js' | sort >files.txt\n\nLet's analyze your command:\ngrep -r --include=*.js *\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to put a directory name as argument while using -r option e.g. (also put '' around glob match so that they don't produce unexpected results):\ngrep -r --include='*.js' .\n\nThis would look for non-empty files i.e. this is equivalent to:\ngrep -r --include='*.js' '.' .\n\n\n*If you want to check for a specific pattern e.g. lines starting with TERM:\ngrep -r --include='*.js' '^TERM' .\n\nAnyway the main point is grep is searching the file contents for any match but your goal is to match against the file names so you should go for something else that can do that e.g. find or a shell loop.\n\nYou can also use the globstar option of bash to search for files ending in .js recursively and then sort them using sort.\nAt first you need to enable the globstar option of bash:\nshopt -s globstar\n\nNow **/*.js will find the files (and directories) with .js extension.\nSo the following should do the trick:\nfor i in **/*.js; do [[ -f $i ]] && echo \"$i\"; done\n\n[[ -f $i ]] is there to ensure that we are dealing with only files on output.\n\nA: grep is a line matching tool. It is suitable for searching contents of a file, but not searching files themselves.\nUse find command to do that. Find is recursive by default and has many many options for optimizing search.\nFor instance, if I wanted to recursively find all of the regular files (not directories) with extension *.png recursively from /home directory and down to the subdirectories, I would tell find to start from /home directory, search for files with -type, and use case-insensetive matching with -iname for files that end in \".png\".\nxieerqi:$ find /home -type f -iname \"*.png\" | head\n/home/xieerqi/Downloads/35457542.png\n/home/xieerqi/genymotion/icons/icon.png\n/home/xieerqi/chinese-calendar-0.8.2/skin/default/ok.png\n/home/xieerqi/chinese-calendar-0.8.2/skin/default/no.png\n/home/xieerqi/chinese-calendar-0.8.2/skin/default/note.png\n/home/xieerqi/chinese-calendar-0.8.2/skin/default/chinesecalendarBGyellow.png\n/home/xieerqi/chinese-calendar-0.8.2/skin/blue/ok.png\n/home/xieerqi/chinese-calendar-0.8.2/skin/blue/no.png\n/home/xieerqi/chinese-calendar-0.8.2/skin/blue/note.png\n/home/xieerqi/chinese-calendar-0.8.2/skin/blue/chinesecalendarBGblue.png\n\n", "Q: how to remove tomcat8 from kubuntu 14.04 I have installed tomcat8 to using instructions from this website https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-8-on-ubuntu-14-04\nBut now I can't set up server in netbeans IDE for this tomcat8. \nI have researched ubuntu forum and found out I have to have tomcat7 to successfully running in netbeans.\nP.S.

If you need anymore details don't hesitate to let me know! \n-Thank you\n\nA: You could  try resetting any one of the locations by using the following command in the terminal:\ngsettings reset-recursively \nFor example: \"gsettings reset-recursively org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys\"\n\nA: Does your laptop have an Fn key???\nIf it does, try holding it down and then pressing the F1→F12 keys.\nWhy??? Some laptops come preconfigured to have their special functions like volume and brightness to be pushed without the Fn, so to actually get the normal F1→F12 key behaviour of olden days, you have to press the Fn.  ;-)\n", "Q: League of Legends \"Unhaled exception: error assertion failed in 32-bit code\" OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit, launching \"League Of Legends\" game through PlayonLinux\nIt worked nicely before last updates.

Even if I delete files, it will almost instantaneously be back to \"0 Bytes Available\" again (as reported by Gnome).\nRunning the Disk Usage Analyzer, it seems the problem is within ~. For example, I had over 6GB free on the root fs. Disk Analyzer shows ~ as 5.7GB but the largest file within ~ is only 175MB and everything added up wouldn't even be 200MB total. So what in ~ is taking up this phantom space? A run of \"du -h\" lists the small files, and then just plain \".\" with a size of 5.8GB! I don't know what this is, or if it's safe to delete it (if that's even possible).\nI've been running this system without issue for quite some time now, until this started popping up. Without available disk space, I can't launch apps and Gnome is completely messed up upon restart - it won't start due to lack of space.\nOn a different yet possibly related issue, I also have another EXT4 data partition which Gnome and the system is also listing as having \"0 bytes\" free space but I know this is incorrect. GParted reports 33GB free. This isn't as big of an issue because it's not affecting the root partition and system usability, but I thought I'd mention it as it very well could be related and needs fixing too.\nThanks for any assistance!\n\nA: One possibility is that some deleted file is still being written to and is expanding:\nDeleting a large file does not free up space\n", "Q: How to add a custom alert sound in Unity I am using Ubuntu 14.04.

It turned out yes:\n\nPS: I have tried \"shutdown /s /t 0\" command to full shutdown Win 10, it doesn't make any sense.\nPPS: I have changed my Windows partitions recently using free partition tools, so I tried \"fixparts\" of Ubuntu, doesn't make sense too.\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\n\nA: Sounds like you are wanting to install Ubuntu. Just because the machine states \"This computer has no detected operating systems\" doesn't mean GRUB won't be able to load them. The installer's partition editor is finicky, and gets confused when you have multiple partitions, or just randomly sometimes.\nI'd install Ubuntu through the \"Something else\" menu you were in (these instructions are case specific, looking at the provided images):\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink /dev/sda2 by however large you want your Ubuntu partition. Having the main system on the SSD increase its speed dramatically. You can do it on the HDD, but the SSD is highly recommended. You currently have 12GB available, so I would at LEAST give Ubuntu 20GB. Looks like the Windows side is pretty full, so be mindful of your space.\n\n*Create a swap partition in that space, but only size it to how much memory you have (usually 4Gb is enough, which is 4096Mb). \n\n*Create an ext4 partition in the remaining space on the /dev/sda SSD for linux, mount at \"/\".\n\n*I'd suggest putting your home partition on that extra HDD drive, since it has a lot of free space, some not even being used. This is OPTIONAL: Create an ext4 partition in the freespace on /dev/sdb HDD for your home folders, mount at \"/home\".\n\n*If you didn't do the last step, you have 120GB's that aren't available on your HDD. I would either resize the partition on there to fill the area (which may take a while), or create another partition in that area for data storage: NTFS if you want it accessible by Windows and Ubuntu, ext4 if you just want it in Ubuntu. Mount it somewhere like \"/mnt/Data\".\n\n*Modify the /dev/sda2 drive, use as NTFS, DO NOT FORMAT, and mount at \"/mnt/Windows\". This allows you to access the Windows files from boot without needing to mount it manually.\n\n*Modify the /dev/sdb5 drive, use as NTFS, DO NOT FORMAT, and mount at \"/mnt/Data\" (or another name if you already used that). This does the same thing as step 6, but for the data partition.\n\n\nThere you have it! You just manually formatted your installation!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Keeps crashing I installed a few updates this morning, and since then ubuntu will not stop crashing.

It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record\n       of an interactive session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out later with lpr(1).\n\n       If the argument file is given, script saves the dialogue in this file.  If no filename is given, the dialogue is saved in\n       the file typescript.\n\nYou can view the session log with e.g cat, less, vim...\nNote however that using things like man or vim during your session produces a lot of escape characters that scramble up the output. I don't know of any way to avoid that.\nIf you need to record output of programs that overwrite the screen, you will also want to record timing information\nscript --timing=mytiming mysession\n\nDoing so allows you to play back the session as it happened in time with\nscriptreplay -t mytiming -s mysession\n\nThe parameter -d can specify a speed-up/slow-down factor.\n", "Q: assign variable with find option shopt -s nullglob\nshopt -s failglob\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*[0-9][0-9]o' -printf 'x' | wc -c\n\nI need to assign the numeric result of the find command to a variable.

It is in the directory /etc/grub.d/10_lupin.  I am trying to install Ubuntu on my old Windows XP computer through wubi Windows installer for Ubuntu.  However, there is a bug in 10_lupin, which is a grub boot file that prevents Ubuntu from loading.  I need to make changes to 10_lupin, but no matter what I do I cannot change it from read to write mode.  So none of my changes can be saved. \n\nA: Edit the file with sudo privileges:\nsudo nano /etc/grub.d/10_lupin\n\nor via\nsudo -H gedit /etc/grub.d/10_lupin\n\n\nIf this does not work, correct the permissions - these are the default ones:\nsudo chown root:root /etc/grub.d/10_lupin\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/grub.d/10_lupin\n\n\nAnd taken from your comments, the file is on a read only filesystem. Therefore you can't change the file.\n\nA: You don't. The files in /etc/grub.d should be writeable only by root. For example:\n$ ls -l /etc/grub.d/10_linux\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  12K Oct 14 12:48 10_linux\n\nYou don't need to change their permissions and you really shouldn't fiddle with system files that way. Just edit the file as root which will allow you to save your changes:\nsudo nano /etc/grub.d/10_lupin\n\nYes, you can give yourself write permissions by running sudo chmod o+x /etc/grub.d/10_lupin but that will give everybody write permissions to that system file. It really isn't a good idea.

Ubuntu disables root login for \"security reasons\". However it seems to me that it doesn't help with security at all.\nIf an intruder manages to get your login password for Ubuntu, then he also has the super-user password, since it's the same as the login password.\nHowever if the root password is required, then just having the login won't help the intruder much - that's right isn't it?\nSo basically, what I want to know is: Why did Ubuntu choose to disable the root password? What are the security reasons?\nPlease don't answer according to what you \"think\" was the reason - I'm looking for an answer from official sources, or linked to them.\n\nA: Mitch posted a good link in comment: Why is it bad to login as root? and the Debian site has the main benefits listed in their wiki:\n\nWhy sudo?\nUsing sudo is better (safer) than opening a session as root for a\n  number of reasons, including:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Nobody needs to know the root password (sudo prompts for the current user's password). Extra privileges can be granted to\n  individual users temporarily, and then taken away without the need for\n  a password change.\n  \n*It's easy to run only the commands that require special privileges via sudo; the rest of the time, you work as an unprivileged user,\n  which reduces the damage that mistakes can cause.\n  \n*Auditing/logging: when a sudo command is executed, the original username and the command are logged. \nFor the reasons above, switching to root using sudo -i (or sudo su)\n  is usually deprecated because it cancels the above features.\n\nRegarding Ubuntu The benefits and disadvantages are listed on our wiki:\n\nBenefits of using sudo\nThere are a number of benefits to Ubuntu leaving root logins disabled\n  by default, including:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The installer has fewer questions to ask.\n  Users don't have to remember an extra password for occasional use (i.e. the root password). If they did, they'd be likely to forget it\n  (or record it unsafely, allowing anyone to easily crack into their\n  system).\n  \n*It avoids the \"I can do anything\" interactive login by default. You will be prompted for a password before major changes can happen,\n  which should make you think about the consequences of what you are\n  doing.\n  \n*sudo adds a log entry of the command(s) run (in /var/log/auth.log). If you mess up, you can go back and see what\n  commands were run.\n  \n*On a server, every cracker trying to brute-force their way in will know it has an account named root and will try that first. What they\n  don't know is what the usernames of your other users are. Since the\n  root account password is locked, this attack becomes essentially\n  meaningless, since there is no password to crack or guess in the first\n  place.\n  \n*Allows easy transfer for admin rights by adding and removing users from groups. When you use a single root password, the only way\n  to de-authorize users is to change the root password.\n  \n*sudo can be setup with a much more fine-grained security policy.\n  The root account password does not need to be shared with everybody who needs to perform some type of administrative task(s) on\n  the system (see the previous bullet).\n  \n*The authentication automatically expires after a short time (which can be set to as little as desired or 0); so if you walk away from the\n  terminal after running commands as root using sudo, you will not be\n  leaving a root terminal open indefinitely. \nDownsides of using sudo\nAlthough for desktops the benefits of using sudo are great, there are\n  possible issues which need to be noted:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Redirecting the output of commands run with sudo requires a different approach. For instance consider sudo ls > /root/somefile\n  will not work since it is the shell that tries to write to that file.\n  You can use ls | sudo tee -a /root/somefile to append, or ls | sudo\n  tee /root/somefile to overwrite contents. You could also pass the\n  whole command to a shell process run under sudo to have the file\n  written to with root permissions, such as sudo sh -c \"ls >\n  /root/somefile\".\n  \n*In a lot of office environments the ONLY local user on a system is root. All other users are imported using NSS techniques such as\n  nss-ldap. To setup a workstation, or fix it, in the case of a network\n  failure where nss-ldap is broken, root is required. This tends to\n  leave the system unusable unless cracked. An extra local user, or an\n  enabled root password is needed here. The local user account should\n  have its $HOME on a local disk, not on NFS (or any other networked\n  filesystem), and a .profile/.bashrc that doesn't reference any files\n  on NFS mounts. This is usually the case for root, but if adding a\n  non-root rescue account, you will have to take these precautions\n  manually. However the advantage of using a local user with sudo is\n  that commands can be easily tracked, as mentioned in the benefits\n  above.\n\nAnd we always have had it (from the very 1st release).\n\nOldest reference I found speaks about 4.10 that has \"sudo\" \n\nSHUTTLEWORTH LAUNCHES DEBIAN-BASED UBUNTU LINUX\n... The Debian-based Ubuntu Linux includes Gnome 2.8, kernel 2.6.8.1, OpenOffice.org 1.1.2 and comes with a text-based, but easy, installation procedure. Ubuntu has disabled the root user preferring to use sudo much like Mac OSX does ...\n\n\nA: I believe that what is written on the help page is clear enough and enough objective.\nUbuntu is \"for everyone\" and although if you are good enough you don't need root access to damage your computer, at the same time you don't need it almost at all (and you know how to easily enable it).\nSo the problem is not with people who are \"good enough\", but for everybody else, that may come to Linux from another world of computing and the first impact is with Ubuntu (and we are many).\nIf you are not an expert and don't know exactly what root is and how to properly handle it, you neither want nor need to have it enabled (and risk, for example, to do a graphic login with it).\nIt is much better to learn how to do things on the safe side and then move on to harder and more dangerous path, than start directly with the hard way and then damage your installation/workstation, get frustrated and maybe unable to recover a fully working system.\nIn general, to prevent is much better than to cure.\n", "Q: another login loop problem Since last week I'm also faced with the endless-loop problem using ubuntu 14.04.3 (installed in dual-boot on HP 840 EliteBook). \nUpon login the screen turns black and returns to the login interface.I have investigated a couple of things, but I am really stuck.

While configuring the minishift, I had changed the /etc/environment by adding PATH variable with a value such as:\nPATH=/path_to_minishift/:$PATH\n\nThe original PATH variable was retained as it is at the beginning of this file. Hence it seems the only reason I encountered GUI login loop on Ubuntu 18.04 was because of me changing the /etc/environment file. Removing the last added line of PATH, helped me login back again.\nAlso, from the login screen when I go to the terminal using Ctrl+Alt+F3, I was unable to find any commands such as ls, for everything I have to use /bin/ls full path to the commands. It was very difficult. Hence, one way I found was rebooting and going to 'More options for ubuntu'. In that, there is an option to open the terminal as root, which gives full permission to modify the system. this helped me to change the /etc/environment file.\n", "Q: OCR-Software sought What is recommended commercially free usable OCR-Software?

I have a list of packages on my system, that were installed and removed again, but not purged, i.e. there are still a lot of conffiles etc. laying around.\nThe output of dpkg --get-selections | grep deinstall lists about 85 different packages which I don't need and want to be purged entirely.\nSo my short question, which I decided to finally ask after experimenting around has lead to this problem, is:\nHow do I completely purge previously installed packages that are already removed?\nReinstalling and then purging is not an option, of course.\n\nA: I just found the following command which worked:\nsudo apt-get purge $(dpkg -l | grep '^rc' | awk '{print $2}')\n\n\nA: My fifty cents, a simple oneliner:\nFirst test with\ndpkg --get-selections | awk '$2==\"deinstall\" {system(\"sudo apt-get --dry-run purge \"$1)}'\n\nand bye bye\ndpkg --get-selections | awk '$2==\"deinstall\" {system(\"sudo apt-get -y purge \"$1)}'\n\n\nExample\n% dpkg --get-selections | grep deinstall\nnginx-common                    deinstall\n\n% dpkg --get-selections | awk '$2==\"deinstall\" {system(\"sudo apt-get -y purge \"$1)}'\n\n% dpkg --get-selections | grep deinstall\n[no output]\n\n\nA: If you just want to purge the whole list, you can use this command; it will perform a dry run, in case essential packages are going to be removed, which you probably don't want to happen:\ndpkg --get-selections | sed -n 's/\\tdeinstall$//p' | xargs sudo apt-get --dry-run purge\n\nIf no essential package is going to be removed, it's safe to run the actual command:\ndpkg --get-selections | sed -n 's/\\tdeinstall$//p' | xargs sudo apt-get --yes purge\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sed -n 's/\\tdeinstall$//p': prints only lines in stdin where a tabulation followed by a deinstall string could be removed from the end of the line; this has the effect of printing only the lines containing a tabulation followed by a deinstall string at the end of the line without the actual tabulation followed by the deinstall string at the end of the line\n\n*xargs sudo apt-get --yes purge: passes each line in stdin as an argument to sudo apt-get --yes purge\n\nA: dpkg  --get-selections | grep deinstall produces a list of package names with the word \"deinstall\":\n$ dpkg  --get-selections | grep deinstall\naccount-plugin-windows-live         deinstall\ndebarchiver                         deinstall\nflashplugin-installer               deinstall\n    ...\n\nBy asking awk to print only the first field we get:\n$ dpkg --get-selections | awk '$2 == \"deinstall\" {print $1}'\naccount-plugin-windows-live\ndebarchiver\nflashplugin-installer\n    ...\n\nNow that we have the list of packages, xargs will let us feed the list of packages to a command (or commands, if the list is long enough):\ndpkg --get-selections | awk '$2 == \"deinstall\" {print $1}' | xargs sudo apt-get purge --dry-run\n\nWhen you are happy with the simulated results, replace --dry-run with -y in the apt-get command.\nRelevant documentation:\nman dpkg awk xargs apt-get\n\n\nA: I asked this myself a couple of days ago. Came up with\napt-get purge $(dpkg -l | awk 'BEGIN{ORS=\" \"} /^rc/{ print $2}')\n\nThe removed but not purged packages appear in the output of dpkg -l with rc at the beginning. awk picks out the second column aka the name of the package and prints them space-separated.\n", "Q: Upgrade Xubuntu 15.04 with a 3.19.0-18-lowlatency kernel I use Xubuntu 15.04 with 3.19.0-18-low latency kernel. If I upgrade the system to Xubuntu 15.10 the kernel will be replaced by a generic? (sorry for my poor english)\n\nA: I do not know exactly how the upgrade scripts work with non-default kernels. The kernel will be probably replaced with generic.\nBut that is not a problem. You can replace generic kernel with a lowlatency by running:\nsudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency\nsudo apt-get remove linux-generic\n\nThis will replace meta-packages and will install the lowlatency kernel. You can also install Synaptic and remove generic linux images and headers.\n\nA: The above is a very good answer.   Generally, if you used a package manager to install a low-latency kernel then when you upgrade you will generally get only other low-latency kernels.  However, if you want to switch either to low-latency or away from it the apt install/remove will work fine\nsudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency\nsudo apt-get remove linux-generic\nor if you want to switch away:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-lowlatency\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\nand then \napt-get autoremove\nto remove the files and menu entry\n", "Q: please explain while loop in the PERL code? This is some code to find word,chars,lines in a file.

Using it in a while loop is the same as\nwhile (defined($_ = readline FILE)) {\n\nSo, it reads the file line by line, assigning each line's contents to the topic variable $_.\nThe ++ operator adds one to a variable.\nThe += operator adds the righthandside value to the lefthandside. length returns length of a string.\nsplit splits the string on a regular expression.

I though apt-get purge will remove all installed files with one pass.\n\n\nMy first expectation, may be droidcam is not well packaged.\n\nA: This and many other packages have problems to be removed after a problem during the installation. My solution, if a script fails, look into the folder /var/lib/dpkg/info/. There are four types of scripts\n\n\n*\n\n*package_name.preinst – pre-installation script\n\n*package_name.postinst – post-installation script\n\n*package_name.prerm – pre-removal script\n\n*package_name.postrm – post-removal script\n\n\nLook into the scripts: It is usually very easy to find the problem immediately. Often it is just a service that can not be started or stopped. Or as in your case, an unloaded module. If you want to only remove the package, remove the offending code and start deleting again.\nAt very problematic cases Sometimes the only way to delete the entire script down to the line exit 0, currently e.g. nginx :(\nAnd as @kos says, remove the line set -e.

Is my driver already installed, or do I need to reinstall Ubuntu again?\nJust for the record if it helps my graphics card is NVidia Geforce 740m\n\nA: As you haven't installed the drivers yet, let's try that.\nIf you want the latest drivers add the repository to software sources:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-cache search nvidia | grep -oE \"nvidia-[0-9]{1,3}\"\n\nI have a list like this:\nnvidia-340\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-352\nnvidia-352\nnvidia-355\nnvidia-355\n\nView full output here.\nThen you need to install one of them. I currently have nvidia-355 (the latest at time of writing) active, but I have also got 352, 346 and 340 as well.\nI'd suggest installing the latest non-dev version, which you can find by searching the nVidia site. This is 355 at the moment, so run this command:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-355\n\nThen restart the computer when this completes. When it boots up, check everything is okay and login and then check the Additional Drivers window.\nIf anything looks buggy, use Ctrl + Alt + F2 to enter tty and login. Then you can install an earlier version, with one of the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-355\n\n\nA: Remove nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get purge '^nvidia.*'\nsudo reboot\n\nInstall the latest drivers:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nYou need to find the latest driver:\nsudo apt-cache search nvidia | grep -oE \"nvidia-[0-9]{1,3}\"\n\nAnd you will see a list of drivers.

I use Apache (80), Tomcat (8080), and PlexMediaServer (32400).\nLately I've tried to install Deluge which opened Pandora's box for me.  It hung when it got to the point \"configuring apache2(versionxx)\".  I had to kill the install.  This led to me noticing that no service call to apache2 or tomcat will work.\nsudo service tomcat7 (start/stop/restart) - hangs\nsudo service apache2 (start/stop/restart) - hangs\nGetting status works, it will tell me those services are running.  I can access my pages hosted by those respective services just fine, but I can't configure the service in any way.  When I issue start/stop/restart, the system hangs on the next line until I issue CTRL + C.  Sometimes that doesn't respond and I have to use CTRL + Z.\nexample:\nx@X:~$ sudo service apache2 stop\n\n<- cursor hangs here on the next line\n\nI've tried about every iteration of apt-get you can imagine, including purge, remove, install.  \nI've tried killall on the respective processes and another fruitless series of attempts to run apt-get, even dpkg reconfigure.  They always hang on configuring Apache2(version), sometimes removing Apache2(version).\nI've tried strace with the PID of Apache2 (not child Apache listeners) to no avail, but really I don't know what I'm looking at.\nNothing I do will make these services respond.  What's more, I can only reboot my computer by issuing \"sudo reboot --force\".  Shutdown now with or without -h doesn't work, nor does sudo reboot by itself.  The computer will remain responsive and accept commands after running anything that's supposed to shut it down EXCEPT sudo reboot --force.\nThis guy was having the same issue as me, but he said a reboot allowed him to remove and reinstall apache.  That didn't work for me.\nWhat can I do next?\n\nA: After much Googling, I forced a reinstall of dpkg and ran a series of cleans, autoremoves, and the like.  I also ran an apt-get update && upgrade -y which had new linux headers and a new plexmediaserver (which I had to force install).\nAll of a sudden I can stop/start/restart both apache2 and tomcat7, and am able to reboot by simply running sudo reboot.\nI'm not 100% sure what I did if I'm honest, but I think it was largely the dpkg reinstall and the successive operations ran with the reinstalled version mentioned above.\nEDIT: I will try to remember to accept my own answer.

I expect that your HDD will be in that dropdown.\nIf it isn't, open \"Disks\" and check that the disk is there, and is mounted. \nClick it and ensure the icon is a Square (not a triangle)\n\nIf it is a triangle, click it and go back to GParted.\n\nA: you can use fdisk command manually for partition editing...\nmay be its a boot loader problem\nto find partition name,use: cat /proc/partitions OR cat /etc/fstab\ninstall GRUB again using live cd\ngrub-install /dev/sdx  (what ever ur drive is)\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sdX\nupdate-grub\n", "Q: simple tar and extract command I am new to Ubuntu (terminal especially) and I am experimenting with the tar command.\nI have created a /test folder containing one single /test.txt file at /var/www/html/test/test.txt. \nI would like to tar only the /test folder (and its contents) to /home/jo/backup.\nMy process so far is as follows:\ncd ~ \ntar cvf testBackup.tar /var/www/html/test/ \n\nThis successfully creates a testBackup.tar located at /home/jo/backup. \nHowever when I extract the tar using the following command: \ntar cvf testBackup.tar /var/www/html/test/\n\nThe folder var is visible, and I have to cd to the /test directory (/var/www/html/test) in order to see the contents.\nBasically I only want to tar the test folder, not the three before (/var/www/html)\nAm I doing something wrong or is this how the command works?\n\nA: go to the location and run the command\ncd /var/www/html\ntar cvf /home/jo/backup/testBackup.tar test\n\n\nA: As tar is designed for backups,too\nyou may specify the least distant path. In your case it is test.\nSo you can use this chain:\ncd /var/www/html;tar cvf testBackup.tar ./test;mv testBackup.tar ~/backup/\n\n\ncd /var/www/html;tar cvf testBackup.tar ./test;rsync  testBackup.tar ~/backup/;rm testBackup.tar # for cross net compability\n\nwhich will tar only your  test folder and move it to your backup directory.\nSee also:\nman tar\n\n\nA: Typically I go to the directory first, then execute the tar command.  This way, we do the dancing up front and allow easy what-you-want extract in the end:\ncd /var/www/html\ntar cvf ~/testBackup.tar test\n\nThe tar command probably has options that allow the same thing without the dancing, just read the man page (man tar).\n", "Q: What happened to the dhelp package?

I'm trying to build a system for public use where the intended use of the file browser (thunar) is to only allow access to home, network shared drives, and any plugged in usb drives.  I would like to prevent them from accessing system folders like for example going \"up\" from home.  Is there any way to configure thunar in this way?\nFrom my previous question: How to keep users out of system files?, I learned that can remove writing and deleting premissions from system files by removing users from the sudo group.  But I don't intend to allow users access to terminal.\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to do this with Thunar. However, you can do:\nsudo chmod o-x <folder>\n\nWhich will keep users that don't have user or group privileges for the folder from descending into the folder.\nDon't do this to the /home directory, because the user will not be able to get to their home directory. You could try removing read access to the /home  directory:\nsudo chmod o-r /home\n\nThis will keep users from seeing any other user's folders, but they should still see their own home folder.\n", "Q: Drm:intel_pipe_config_compare [i915]] *error* mismatch in ips_enabled After installing 15.10 on my yoga everything seemed to work fine.\nBut after some reboots i got this message.\nI found this report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1492764\nSaying \"it disappeared with 4.3.0-040300rc3-generic.\"\nBut i cannot start X any more to start the internet connection and download the new kernel.\nIs there a workaround to get an X running to fix this?\n\nA: I reinstalled Ubuntu 15.10 from the same beta image like before and I cannot re-surrect this error any more.\nWhat I did different this time was that I disabled animations with:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false\n\nThen I updated the system\napt-get update; apt-get upgrade\n\nbefore I installed these packages that are mainly usually part of kde:\napt-get install kate krusader dolphin chromium-browser\n\nSo it definitely can work wit kernel 4.2.0-11-generic\n", "Q: Could not open builtin file modules.builtin.bin I was trying to run modprobe fuse. \nBut could not get it to run.

You can use the which command to find out where restart is located: which restart.

So in my little knowledge about Linux I think I removed more than lightdm. \nI can't fix it through sudo apt-get install lightdm. Or do I have to install the whole OS? \nThe reason for the autoremove was that the login was in loop and after login the login window appeared again.\nI need some help :)\n\nA: You might try: sudo apt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter\nassuming you are using gnome, or mate. \nYou could try  sudo apt-get install lightdm-kde-greeter\nif you are using kde. \nif you are using unity, then try installing unity-greeter:\nsudo apt-get install unity-greeter\nif the appropriate version of any one of those is installed, but you still cannot login via the greeter, then shift to a terminal, (ctrl+alt+F6) and login via the terminal. Once you are logged in there, you might try giving the sudo lightdm command, and see what happens. If it works, or fails with errors. You might also try startx to see if your DE loads properly after you login via the terminal. \n", "Q: How would I get an update mirror to use its mirror folder for an update I have a trusty mirror file structure mounted from an external volume.

(I have to use xset dpms force off because my monitor will not come back on when using normal Ubuntu power/suspend settings.  Different problem...)  But xprintidle will reset to 0 ms every 30 seconds whether I am using my machine or not.  i.e., whether I am moving the mouse/clicking/scrolling or typing on the keyboard.

The \"idle\ntime\" is the number of milliseconds since input was received on any\ninput device.  If unsuccessful, the program prints a message to stderr\nand exits with a non-zero exit code.\n\nSo, I suppose that moving the mouse would reset the timeout. This make sense, since the timeout in question is leading to screen blanking/locking.  \nLooking further in the source, one sees the functions that xprintidle uses. (XScreenSaverAllocInfo(), DPMSQueryExtension(), etc). Reading the man page for these functions will give you more detail (man XScreenSaverAllocInfo).  \nHow I got the source to look at:  \n# Includes several set-up-the-environment steps\nmkdir ${HOME}/apt-src  \ncd ${HOME}/apt-src\nsudo apt-get install apt-src\napt-src install xprintidle\ncd xprintidle-0.2/\nls\nless xprintidle.c\ncd ..\napt-src remove xprintidle\n\n", "Q: How to specify path to the installed tool?

So the first step to that is to unzip the downloaded installation archive and then run ./install as superuser. When I do that, ideally the Matlab interactive installation launcher should come up on the screen and guides you through the installation. However when I do this, my terminal displays the following:\n$./install\n\nPreparing installation files ...\n\nInstalling ...\n\nFinished\n\nBut the interactive launcher never shows up, and neither is Matlab installed when I check for it. These lines appear rather quickly (1-2 seconds) on the terminal, so it seems improbable that Matlab has been installed in any form.\nI tried installing on another machine from the same installation archive I downloaded, and the installation launcher comes up immediately. So I believe the problem is on my machine, but I cannot figure out what it is.\nAnyone facing the same issue and having resolved it, please help. Many thanks!\n\nA: Thanks for the answers. The problem has been resolved - it seems that the archive I downloaded was corrupt in some way. I realised this when I downloaded the archive again from the Mathworks website a few minutes ago and tried to install it again, and low and behold, it worked! I'm sorry to have wasted everyone's time without having tried that before. Now I only wonder whether the initial problem encountered was due to a poor internet connection and thus a faulty archive downloaded, or whether the .zip archive provided by Matlab is not the best archiving / compressing format.\n", "Q: Driver problem with AMD/ATI Bonaire XT Radeon HD 7790/8770 First of all sorry if I ask a dumb question, I'm new to Ubuntu.

I am having a hard time installing the Chromium Browser. Do I have to have Ubuntu fully installed to the hard drive to be able to do this?  For the time being, I am booting from USB.\n\nA: Short answer: Yes you can install apps to the bootable usb.\nLong answer: Installing applications require enough space for the programs to run, so if you have Ubuntu on a small bootable usb then it may not have enough space to install. Also any apps that you install to the bootable drive will be deleted as soon as you shutdown or reboot the computer.

Please note that this issue is just with containers on boot; if I login, all my unprivileged containers works as expected.\n\nA: Just in case anyone else could have the same problem, my solution:\nSeems that cron doesn't use a complete shell login, with all variables set, among them the cgroup related environment. So, when cron tries to start the containers, it fails.\nThe only thing I could find to solve my problem is to ssh into the same machine, and then start the containers. Something like this:\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa\n$ ssh-copy-id localhost\n\nAfther that, I put in my crontab:\n@reboot sleep 5 && ssh -l eduar localhost lxc-autostart\n\n", "Q: What's the correct way to change the `PATH` environmental variable? When it comes to changing the PATH environment variable (say, in \"~/.bashrc\"), I've seen some different ways of doing it:\nPATH=$PATH:/new/path\nPATH=\"$PATH:/new/path\"\nexport PATH = $PATH:/new/path\nexport PATH = ${PATH}:/new/path\nsetenv PATH $PATH:/new/path\n\nWhat are the { } for? When are the \" \" needed? When to use export or setenv? Btw, my Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't have a manual entry for export, but it has one for setenv. Why?\n\nA: \nWhen it comes to changing the PATH environment variable (say, in \"~/.bashrc\"), I've seen some different ways of doing it\n\nSome of them are valid ways of setting $PATH, but some of them are not valid ways of setting $PATH; most have the same catch and some differ in their scope;\nSpeaking of the syntax (in Bash / compatible shells);\n\n\n*\n\n*PATH=$PATH:/new/path: is ok, but you'll need to escape spaces in \"/new/path\", if any;\n\n*PATH=\"$PATH:/new/path\": is ok, and you won't need to escape spaces in \"/new/path\", if any;\n\n*export PATH = $PATH:/new/path: is not ok, as you can't have spaces before / after an assignment operator (and you'd need to escape spaces in \"/new/path\");\n\n*export PATH = ${PATH}:/new/path: same as export PATH = $PATH:/new/path;\n\n*setenv PATH $PATH:/new/path: setenv is a csh built-in; it should be the same as PATH=$PATH:/new/path;\n\n\nSingle / double quotes both prevent Bash from breaking on whitespaces; single quotes prevent Bash from performing parameter expansions, command substitutions or arithmetic expansions, forcing Bash to interpret the enclosed string literally; double quotes instead don't prevent Bash to perform parameter expansions, command substitutions or arithmetic expansions, and in the second case they are needed in order to allow a parameter expansion on $PATH;\nBraces are required in case the character following a variable is a valid character for a variable name, however : is not, so in the fourth case they're not really needed;\nSpeaking of the differences between var=value, export var=value and setenv var value;\n\n\n*\n\n*var=value sets the value of $var in the current shell; forked shells / processes won't inherit the variable nor its value;\n\n*export var=value sets the value of $var in the current environment; forked shells / processes will inherit the variable and its value;\n\n*setenv PATH $PATH:/new/path: same as export var=value;\n\n\n$ foo=bar\n$ bash\n$ echo $foo\n\n$ exit\nexit\n$ export foo=bar\n$ bash\n$ echo $foo\nbar\n\n\nBy the way, my Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't have a manual entry for export, but it has one for setenv. Why?\n\nIf you type man setenv, you get the output of man 3 setenv, which is the manual entry of the setenv() function from the \"Linux Programmer's Manual\"; as said before, there's no setenv command in Ubuntu nor built-in in Bash named setenv, although there's a setenv built-in in csh;\nexport instead is a Bash built-in, and to get informations about it you'll have to run help export:\n$ help export\nexport: export [-fn] [name[=value] ...] or export -p\n    Set export attribute for shell variables.\n\n    Marks each NAME for automatic export to the environment of subsequently\n    executed commands.  If VALUE is supplied, assign VALUE before exporting.\n\n    Options:\n      -f    refer to shell functions\n      -n    remove the export property from each NAME\n      -p    display a list of all exported variables and functions\n\n    An argument of `--' disables further option processing.\n\n    Exit Status:\n    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or NAME is invalid.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 internet only works for a few minutes after boot I recently purchased a Toshiba satellite L15W-B1208D two in one laptop/tablet. The first thing I did was to wipe websites and install Ubuntu 14.04, as that was the distro I was used to. With 14.04 installed I could only use the internet for about 5-10 minutes after booting the machine. After that it would still say it was connected to Wi-Fi but I could not use the internet to do anything. Browsers would time out, curl would not work, the software center couldn't download packages, etc. I spent days reading forums and trying everything that was suggested in previous posts. Finally I found a post saying an upgrade to 15.04 could help, so I tried it. The internet seems to last a little longer but eventually it disappears and the only way to reconnect is rebooting. \nPlease do not mark this as off topic because it can't be reproduced; it happens every time I boot on any different Wi-Fi network.\nI apologize for the long post, I'm a first time poster and wanted to be detailed. Let me know if there are any commands I could run and post the output of to help diagnose. \nAdditional info: the machine has no Ethernet connection and has a Realtek RTL8723BE network driver, currently running 15.04 as the only OS.\nThanks in advance!\nEdit: Thanks for the quick reply Jeremy!\nOn 14.04 I first tried the basics like resetting the router and restarting network-manager from the command line. After that I tried live booting from a usb stick to see if the problem persisted, which it did. Then I tried changing the IPv6 settings to \"link local only\" as suggested here: WIreless connects but Internet stops working on Ubuntu 12.04 64 Bit and Broadcom 4313. Then I tried \nsudo dhclient wlan0\nas suggested here: Internet stops working after a few minutes (13.04).\nThen I tried\nsudo apt-get remove network-manager\nand reinstalling it from a flash drive.

What could be wrong with this?\nWhen the script is manually run from CLI, it works and screenshot is generated.\nI also tried putting the cron on root's crontab. No luck.\n\nA: You need to specify the X DISPLAY.  You can do this in your script.\nModify your script to read:\n#!/bin/sh\nmkdir -p --mode=0755 /home/username/.sst/rslt/$(date +%Y)/$(date +%m)/$(date +%d)/$(date +%H)\nexport DISPLAY=:0 && scrot '/home/username/.sst/rslt/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M%S.png'\n\nThe above display specification is assuming that screen \":0\" is your active X DISPLAY owned by you (owned by the user running the crontab).\nThere are a number of ways you can specify the DISPLAY.  You could use as the third line:\nenv DISPLAY=:0 scrot '/home/username/.sst/rslt/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M%S.png'\n\nOr you could call your original script with one of many variations including:\n* * * * * env DISPLAY=:0 /home/username/.sst/cmd.sh\n\nYou could replace /home/username with the variable userhome from the two lines:\nusername=`whoami`\nuserhome=`egrep \"^$username:\" /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $6}'`\n\n", "Q: upgrade to ubuntu 15.04 along with windows 7 without losing data I have installed ubuntu 14.04 version on my desktop along with windows 7.

I want to file a bug but I don't know where to start regarding a kernel bug.  Please advise.\nEdit: In case anyone has this same problem and comes looking, bug is 1507863\n\nA: The preferred method of reporting kernel bugs is done by using the terminal. To open the terminal press CTRL+ALT+T. When the terminal is open you enter ubuntu-bug linux and press the ENTER button.\nWhen you're submitting a bug it is important to give as much information as possible. They'd like you to include a few things so be prepared for and include at least the following information:\n\n\n*\n*The majority of kernel bug are hardware specific so be sure to note what hardware/device is being used.\n\n*Document any known steps to reproduce the bug.\n\n*Also note whether the bug exists in previous kernel versions of Ubuntu or if it's a regression from previous kernel versions.\n\n*Finally, it's critical to also make sure to test the latest development Ubuntu kernel version as well as the latest upstream mainline kernel.\n\nThis should cover most use cases.

Supposedly, this is the laptop's firmware not implementing Active State Power Manager correctly. You can tell the Linux kernel not to use ASPM by adding this kernel parameter: pcie_aspm=off.

You can also find this in the start menu on Windows.\nOn Ubuntu, you use Alt + F2 to open this:\n\nAnd on lubuntu it is \"Menu\" -> \"Run\".\nAnd then run the command\nxulrunner /home/clain/myapp/application.ini\n\ngraphically, without a terminal being needed.\n\nYour second option is to run in a terminal, but unlink it from the terminal with the & character, like so:\nxulrunner /home/clain/myapp/application.ini &\n\nthis will start it as a separate process. Here is an example with Gedit:\n\nAs you can see, I can run another command without affecting Gedit. It will keep running. If I was to not use the & the terminal would be attached. Closing the terminal gives this message:\n\nAnd of course if I do close it Gedit will stop.

Then if your icon name is \"MyApp.svg\" just use the line Icon = MyApp.\nIf you still want the \"TryExec\" line, which isn't needed, A.B.'s answer explains why you do.\n\nA: The entry TryExec is wrong and that's the reason for your error message:\n\nInvalid desktop entry file: '/home/clain/Desktop/myapp'\n\nThe definition for TryExec is\n\nPath to an executable file on disk used to determine if the program is\n  actually installed. If the path is not an absolute path, the file is\n  looked up in the $PATH environment variable. If the file is not\n  present or if it is not executable, the entry may be ignored (not be\n  used in menus, for example).\n\nUse\nTryExec=xulrunner\n\nbecause\nxulrunner /home/clain/myapp/application.ini\n\nisn't an executable file. It's an executable with a parameter.\n\nA: you can write a script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nxulrunner /home/clain/myapp/application.ini\n\nthen save that script some place Im calling \"myapp\" for example.\nyou can then make myapp executable, by giving the command chmod +x myapp\nor by right clicking the file, going tot hte permissions tab and checking the make executable box.\nYou can then make you script a system command, using the ln command\nyou simply put a symbolic link to myapp in somewhere in the PATH.\necho $PATH to see what your options are.\nI'll be using \"/usr/local/bin\"\nthen you give a command like this:\nsudo ln -s /absolute/path/to/myapp /usr/local/bin/myapp\nor to make a Desktop Icon:\nln -s /absolute/path/to/myapp /home/user/Desktop/myapp\nnow your app is usable from the command-line, you can type $myapp, and it will run. \nnow, you can now create panel, or dock custom launchers, which will not occupy your terminal, even though they will be calling the terminal. \nAlternatively,xulrunner /home/clain/myapp/application.ini &\nisn't bad advice, but if you make a script, and a link, and or custom launchers, you never have to type that stuff again. \nYou can right click the panel, and select \"Add To Panel\"\nthen select custom application Launcher. Then you can give the command \"myapp\" or call the script directly. \n", "Q: 'sudo tee' command gone wrong | Removing a source.list that can't be read? This has happened twice where I followed instructions on installing software and then having the software center open then close immediately as a result of running the commands from the instructions. The first incident happened when I was trying to install Mono. I followed their instructions up to sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-xamarin.list. The terminal stopped was not responding so I put the command back in and it just echoed it. So I closed it and tried it again with no luck.

This caused whatever done before i.e. export PS1 becomes useless, since the new prompt will overwrite the earlier ones.\n\n\n*Another issue is probably some typos. I couldn't find any reason for leaving the one-sided square bracket [ being opened.\nThis HOWTO noted that it should be enclosed.\n\nAs mentioned before, non-printing escape sequences have to be enclosed in \\[\\033[ and \\]. For colour escape sequences, they should also be followed by a lowercase m.\n\nThe workaround\nUse separate .bashrc file per different PS1 configuration. Then, run bash that calls another bash with --init-file option to run prompt using the separate .bashrc file.\nFollow the steps below.\n\n*\n\n*Create an empty file with different name i.e. .bashrc2 in Home directory.\n\n\n*Open the file in a text editor, copy and paste the following (revised).\n export PS1=\"\\[\\033[0;32m\\](\\$(date +%H:%M:%S)) \\W$ \\[\\033[0m\\]\"     \n\n\n\n*Save and close the file.\n\n\n*Create another empty file with different name i.e. shortcut2.desktop on Desktop.\n\n\n*Open the file in a text editor, copy and paste the following.\n [Desktop Entry]\n Version=1.0\n Name=Terminal 2\n Comment=Open Terminal with .bashrc2\n Exec=bash -c 'bash --init-file $HOME/.bashrc2'\n Icon=utilities-terminal\n Terminal=true\n Type=Application\n Categories=Application;\n\n\n\n*Save and close the file.\n\n\n*Finally, double-click the shortcut (now appears as Terminal 2 on Desktop) to run the prompt.\nRepeat the steps for other configurations, if any, by giving different names i.e. .bashrc3, shortcut3.desktop and such.\nThe unexplained\nRunning bash --init-file $HOME/.bashrc2 alone will fail to include the PS1 configuration. The resulting prompt will be discolored and will fall back to [\\u@\\h:\\w]$ format. In other words, the .bashrc2 file is entirely ignored.

could you guys please help me here...?\n\nA: I have found the solution months ago but i saw this question of mine so i said let's answer it so, people like me that couldn't find the answer until going through all that trouble, could easily find out how to solve it...\nWell first of all let me introduce you to protocol's codes in ns2.\nA protocol has been created with 2 main files(there is some protocols with only one file too but i'm talking about the most of them) in ns2 that one of them has .cc type that contains the protocol's name(like AODV.cc) for definition and the other one has the .h type for declaration and it also contains the protocols name(like AODV.h).\n\nThere could be other files including the protocol but the main is protocolname.cc.\n\nWe need to change/add some functions in the protocolname.cc so we could simulate our own protocol.\nFor example :\nWe need to use clustering for our protocol :\nAODV.h :\n\npublic:\n    AODV();\n    void CLUSTERING();\n    ...\n\nAODV.cc :\n\nvoid AODV::CLUSTERING(){\n    if(current_){\n         while(numberofNodes){\n               // Selecting clusters\n         }\n    }\n}\n\nNow we know how the mechanism of ns2 works.so let's get started with sleep nodes.\nFirst of all there is 4 functions in ns2 for turning a node to 'off', 'on', 'sleep', 'idle'.\nThe difference between these are not so big.\nAs you know the 'off' function turns a node to off but it still broadcasts something based on your protocol.\n\n$ns_ at 7.0 \"$node(2) off\"\n\nAnd you can turn it on like :\n\n$ns_ at 7.0 \"$node(2) on\"\n\nThe base is : \n$simulator at $time \"$Node_($number) off\"\n\nI don't know how to set a node to sleep in scenario.tcl but you can do that in your protocol's codes.\nNow, to set a node to sleep we could do several things...\n\n\n*\n\n*setting nodes to sleep from energy model\n\n*setting nodes to sleep from wireless physics\n\n\nFirst we'll try energymodel.cc and if it didn't work we'll use the other one.\nTo set a node to sleep from energymodel.cc we can use this code in void Mac802_11::recv function in ns-2.35/mac/mac-802_11.cc :\n\nif(index_ == myNode){\n    EnergyModel *em = netif_->node()->energy_model();\n    if (em && em->sleep()) {\n        em->set_node_sleep(1);\n        //em->set_node_state(EnergyModel::INROUTE);\n    }\n}\n\nReplace myNode with the number of the interface you want to set it to off.\nIf you are not using MultiInterface for your simulation so the number of interfaces will be equal to the number of your nodes.\nexample :\nNormal :\n            node ---- > interface ----> channel\n\nMultiInterface :\n                         ---- > interface[0] -----|\n                        |                          ---------|\n                        |                                   v\n            node -------|---- > interface[1] --------- > channel\n                        |                                   ^\n                        |                         ----------|\n                         ---- > interface[2] -----|\n\nOpen a terminal and cd to your ns2 directory, for example if you have ns-allinone-2.35, cd to /ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35/ and now type make and inter.\nAfter it finished try to simulate your scenario.tcl.\nNow if your simulation start and you see the nam file, when the nodes get the first packet, the shape of them must change from balck circle to black circle blue hexagon.\nFrom then on the nodes must not send or receive any data packet.\nIf this way didn't work now it's the time to use the other option.\nGo to /ns-2.35/mac/ and open wireless-phy.cc.\nYou'll see that at the end of the file it contains our 4 function that we need.\nwe can simply use those function on the wireless-phy.cc to set a node to sleep or off by just calling those functions.But we may need to use them in another layer like in mac.\nTo use those functions in mac-802_11.cc simply use the below code anywhere you want in mac-802_11.cc and add wireless-phy.cc to your mac headers:\n #include \"wireless-phy.h\" // at the header of mac-802_11.cc\n\n /*\n  * Use the below code in any function you want in mac\n  */\n Phy *p;\n p=netif_;\n ((WirelessPhy *)p)->node_sleep();\n\nAnd to use another one of those 4 function just change the function's name like ->node_sleep(); to ->node_wakeup();.\n\nA: A node can be \"Off\" and \"On\" by invoking WirelessPhy::command(int argc, const char*const* argv) of WirelessPhy.cc from Tcl script. To do this, say for Node_(0), once the node is defined in Tcl script, do:\nset        Netif_0        [$Node_(0) set netif_(0)]\n\nNote that the variable netif_ is an array and hence we use netif_(0) to get\nthe handle for the first Network Interface. netif_(1) and netif(2)...\ncan be similarly used for Second and Third Network Interfaces, if the node\nwas configured with multiple interfaces. \nOnce the handles are brought to local scope, we can use any command that is\ndefined in WirelessPhy and we can use $Netif_0 NodeOff to switch off the node to deactivate the Network Interface.\n", "Q: Unable To Cancel Installation In Software Center (Matlab) A Note: This question may be the exact same question as given in How to cancel an installation in the Software Center? but the solutions listed there haven't worked for me.\nQuestion: \nI am trying to terminate a software installation from Ubuntu Software Center.

I have a binary file called qkey - when I try to open it with gedit, I get an error telling me that the file is in an unknown format.\nIs this due to possible encryption? (it is a game stats file after all...)\nOr is it simply that gedit can't open binary files?\n\nA: I've tried a number of different applications to open binary files. The one that I've used and enjoyed the most is called bless and it is really easy to install. Simply open the terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+T and type sudo apt-get install bless and press ENTER. Note: You will have to enter your password, when you enter your password there will be no indicator on the screen, no asterisks, and the cursor will not move. This is normal behavior. After entering your password press ENTER again and follow any additional instructions given.\nAs a hex editor, bless has lots of features and is actually surprisingly light. This should open your game file and allow you to edit it. I can't actually help with anything beyond that as I am not a gamer. However, it's in the repo and is easy enough to install without taking up much room or being overly complex.\nYou can read more and learn more about bless by clicking here.\n\nA: You can use hexdump to open a binary file.\nhexdump -C qkey | more\n\nor use vim with the tips\n\nA: Sublime Text seems to be more reliable than gedit in both supported file types and handling large buffers more easily.\n", "Q: Close only the unresponsive split in a Byobu window?

Then you format your USB drive the way you would normally format any internal drive and select to install the bootloader onto it.\nYou will get a USB drive with a normal Ubuntu installation that you can start from many machines by holding F11, F12, etc. during boot and selecting the USB port the drive is in.\nI've used this method to create a USB drive which I could take everywhere to access my emails on a secure OS that I control. Make sure to encrypt the drive, in case you should lost it.\nDerivatives such as Lubuntu are especially useful for this, as they will work well even on USB2 and with older machines.

That simply means that your Ubuntu Phone service provider is updating your phone software instead of like with a desktop where you would manage your software upgrades. This is likely a whole operating system upgrade or collection of core software rather than applications from an app store.\nFrom Softpedia:\n\nCanoical's Łukasz Zemczak has sent in his report on the work done by\n  the Ubuntu Touch developers in preparation for the seventh OTA\n  (Over-the-Air) software update for the mobile operating system.\nAccording to Mr. Zemczak, things are calming down in the Ubuntu Touch\n  world, as the last remaining bugs to be implemented in the OTA-7\n  update have been fixed, along with various other minor changes.\n  Therefore, the developers have already started to build the re-spin\n  images, perform sanity checks, as well as delta testing.\nIf the testing results are OK, the Ubuntu Touch OTA-7 images will be\n  sent to phone manufacturers, in this case BQ and Meizu, for the final\n  check. Then, Canonical will start uploading the OTA-7 images to the\n  official mirrors and send the update to all Ubuntu phone users, which\n  will happen sometime in the first half of next week.\n\"The (hopefully) final OTA-7 re-spin is in progress with the two\n  blocking issue fixed and changes released. Big thanks to everyone\n  involved,\" said Łukasz Zemczak. \"Once the image is built QA will\n  perform sanity and delta testing on the generated images and if\n  everything is ok, the image will then go to manufacturers for a final\n  check. ETA for release: first half of next week.\"\n\nSo we see that in this case it's the 7th update of this sort.\n\nA: An over-the-air update (OTA update) is the wireless delivery of new software or data to mobile phones and tablets.\nSource: http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/OTA-update-over-the-air-update\n\nA: Trying to explain it on simple terms it may be tempting to compare an OTA (Over-the-Air) software update to a Service Pack for modern devices:\n\nIn computing, a service pack or SP (in short SP) or a feature pack (FP) comprises a collection of updates, fixes, or enhancements to a software program delivered in the form of a single installable package. Companies often release a service pack when the number of individual patches to a given program reaches a certain (arbitrary) limit, or the software release has shown to be stabilized with a limited number of remaining issues based on users' feedback and bug tracking such as bugzilla. In large software applications such as office suites, operating systems, database software, or network management, it is not uncommon to have a service pack issued within the first year or two of a product's release. Installing a service pack is easier and less error-prone than installing many individual patches, even more so when updating multiple computers over a network, where service packs are common.\n\nThe difference is that with modern devices most of these are not installer based like Windows Installer or individual apps but (filesystem) image based, which means your devices main filesystem (root) will be overwritten with the new image instead of tediously checking if a file exists and needs updating or not. To save bandwidth and writes to the flash memory mechanisms like delta updates are used, which works under the assumption that this particular filesystem is in pristine condition, not modified by someone else and on a specific version that is eligible for a (delta) update. Which is why you shouldn't use desktop package management software like APT on these devices, because it will either revert all changes made or lead to an unstable system (bricked!).\n", "Q: Question about root user and/or running certain commands in my terminal?

I have installed a low latency kernel to help Ardour's performance while recording audio. On boot-up, it appears I can select which 'version' of Ubuntu I want; the two choices are 'Ubuntu' and 'Ubuntu low-latency'. However, when I run uname -r with either one, I get 3.14.0-031400-lowlatency. \nWhy the separate boot up options if 'Ubuntu' is the same as 'Ubuntu low-latency'? Is there a way to actually boot-up with the generic kernel? Is there a reason to, or are there drawbacks from using the low latency kernel while doing my day-to-day tasks?\n\nA: Here is a nice fix with dual listing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Low-latency\n\n\n*\n\n*Download ubuntustudio-default-settings package from http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/ubuntustudio-default-settings (choose your release through links in the top right corner)\n\n*Extract it.\n\n*Copy 09_lowlatency file to /etc/grub.d/\nIf you don't want low-latency entry to be the top one, rename it to 11_lowlatency so it will be processed after 10_linux.\n\n\n*Generic and other kernel types\nEdit /etc/grub.d/10_linux as explained in this answer to exclude low-latency kernel from its listing.\n\nA: The answer by Sneetsher is valid, but, just as an alternative, I used a different solution. If you want to have separate entries in GRUB in /etc/grub.d/ for generic and lowlatency kernels, you can just make a copy of the file 09_lowlatency. If you want the new entry to be the first one, name it something like 08_generic, but you can choose the ordering as you prefer (e.g. you can have 08_lowlatency and 09_generic). Then, edit the copied file and replace all the occurrences of lowlatency with generic, and update GRUB. That should give you the two options on boot.\n", "Q: Huawei 3G Dongle Ubuntu connects to Vodacom network and works fine, but cant see utility window that shows usage or any other information\n\nA: You can try download-monitor\nsudo apt-get install download-monitor\n\nThis software Monitors your network usage to help you stay within usage caps.\nYou can also set a cap on your usage if you need to.\n", "Q: Compile a program in a \"compatibility mode\" I need to use a program called SPMRoot.

This lowers that window so its behind all other windows.  \n\nA: A shamlessly dirty solution\nTo achieve a command that does what you want turns out to be more complicated than it seems at first sight. The issue is to lower the window and maintain the window order (z-wise) at the same time, which seems nearly impossible. Both xdotool and wmctrl provide commands to raise a window, but not to lower a window.\nThe solution below is a dirty hack/workaround, but it works nicely and reliably nevertheless. It uses both wmctrl and xdotool, which are not on your system by default.\nAlthough the script is run by a keyboard shortcut, it actually does exactly the same as when you middle-click on the top of your window. What it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*It looks up the active window (using xprop -root)\n\n*Looks up if the window is a \"normal\" window (unlike e.g. your desktop, which is also listed in wmctrl -lG as a window)\n\n*If so, it calculates the position of the top of the window, moves the mouse to the calculated position, simulates middle- click and moves the mouse back to where you left it.\n\n\nThis all happens in a split second, so you won't even notice the mouse moving and moving back. The only thing you notice is the window sent to back, which is exactly what you want.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n# find the frontmost window\nactive = [l for l in subprocess.check_output([\"xprop\", \"-root\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines() \\\n          if \"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" in l][0].split(\"#\")[-1].strip()\n# convert the window-id from xprop- format to wmctrl- format\nw_id = active[:2] + str((10-len(active))*\"0\")+active[2:]\n# if the window is a \"normal\" window, find the window geometry in wmctrl -lG,\n# move the mouse to the top of the window and click the middle button\nif \"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in subprocess.check_output([\"xprop\", \"-id\", w_id]).decode(\"utf-8\"):\n    match = [l for l in subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lG\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines() if w_id in l][0].split()[2:6]\n    current_mousepos = subprocess.check_output([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    coords = ([s.replace(\"x:\", \"\") for s in current_mousepos if s.startswith(\"x:\")][0],\n              [s.replace(\"y:\", \"\") for s in current_mousepos if s.startswith(\"y:\")][0])\n    top_x = str(int(int(match[0])+(int(match[2])/2))); top_y = str(int(match[1]) -10)\n    # The time.sleep(0.3) possibly needs to be optimized (longer sleep = safer); the 0.3 works fine on my system when used from a keyboard shortcut (which turns out to make a difference...)\n    subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", \"--sync\", top_x, top_y]); time.sleep(0.3)\n    # move the mouse back to its original position\n    subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"click\", \"2\"]); time.sleep(0.05)\n    subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", coords[0], coords[1]])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Install both wmctrl and xdotool\nsudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script above into an empty file, save it as sendtoback.py\n\n*Test- run the script by opening a terminal, run the command in it:\npython3 /path/to/sendtoback.py\n\nThe window should be sent to the background, exactly like you were used to when middle-clicked.\n\n*If all works fine, Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/sendtoback.py\n\nto a key shortcut of your choice.\nNote\nIn some cases (especially on slower systems), the sleep time in the line:\nsubprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", \"--sync\", top_x, top_y]); time.sleep(0.3)\n\nneeds to be increased. On faster systems, it could be reduced.\n\nA: Gnome provides keybindings via gnome-keybinding-properties in Gnome 2, and via gnome-control-center keyboard in Gnome 3.\nIn Gnome 2, the default active keybinding that comes close to what you want is\n\nRaise window if it's covered by another window, otherwise lower it\n\nusing a shortcut of Win+space\n\nEdit: I'm using mate now, which is a fork of Gnome 2, and using the command line gives me either \"Command not found\" for gnome-keybinding-properties, or a core dump for gnome-control-center.\nBut using the UI, the key binding are accessible under System->Control Center->Hardware->Keyboard Shortcuts.

If it weren't deleted after the current Ubuntu installation that you have, you would see the option to boot either into Windows or into Ubuntu.  If you had other recognizable OS installations you would also have a grub menu item to chose those.\nSince, in your description you have said that you (inadvertently) have a Ubuntu only installation.  You can boot then run this in a terminal.\n$ sudo update-grub\n\nGrub will see all your OS installations and in your next boot you will have an option to boot into either.\nIf you don't have Windows as a boot option in the grub menu you can install Windows, then run the steps below to install Grub so that you can have the option to choose which OS to boot to.\nWhile in Ubuntu, launch gnome-disk-utility to check all your available drive partitions.  You can use this utility to mount the various partitions to look for any of your Windows data, or to identify a partition for installing Windows.\nYou can also use gparted.  You can either install it with $ sudo apt-get install gparted and run it from Ubuntu or you can boot to the Live Ubuntu install disk and run it from there.\nThen from gparted you can create the partition or size your partitions to accommodate the installations you want... similar to what you have described you've been doing... be sure to back up your important data before modifying the partitions.\nOnce you reinstall Windows, you will no longer be able to boot to Grub.  Windows will install it's own boot manager.

If this doesn't work, some of the partitions that can be booted should have a \"boot\"-flag. Check with e.g. gparted. I suggest boot from a live USB/DVD/CD and run gparted - also from the live system, mount your NTFS Windows partition - check that everything is ok. Then if everything fails, I would run the Windows install disk (knowingly, this will overwrite grub). Then you get to the point where, whenever you reboot Windows will start. And when you're here, you're almost home - THEN you run grub (from live-dvd/cd/usb) and then I'm absolutely sure that it'll find Windows and your other operating systems... I've tried this many times also. I think you'll succeed with this methodology...\n", "Q: Ubuntu detecting two external monitors as only one?

Is it possible to remove that?\nscreenshot of the empty bar\n\nA: Terminal emulators work with a grid of cells: a whole number of cells both horizontally and vertically. That's why when you resize the window by dragging its corner, it resizes in unusually large steps rather than pixels. (KDE's terminal emulator \"konsole\" is a notable exception which you can resize to any pixel size, and you'll see the same empty bar at the bottom and right as you do in gnome-terminal's fullscreen mode, even when konsole is not fullscreen.)\nIn fullscreen mode, gnome-terminal is forced to a size that's not a multiple of the size of its character cells. Utilities and applications running inside terminals have no notion of such partial cells and couldn't draw in the remaining area, it just doesn't exist for them.\nYou might want to experiment with different font sizes, you might find one where an integer number of cells just fit (or at least the gap is not that large) – but it'll probably break as you open your second tab and the tab bar appears.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Install alongside Windows Okay, I was wondering what file Ubuntu sees in windows to know to do the option of install alongside windows?

It will be something like this:\njava -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel YourAppName\nYou will have to substitute the application name for YourAppName.

Also transferring zeros is an unrealistic benchmark and you didn't say how the RAID set that you compare it to is configured.\nIf you test several individual rotational disks with actual data and workloads (dd is not an appropriate benchmarking tool just because it can display statistics) you will find that 60-80 MB/s is typical performance for some slower disks built into external drives. You may also find these more realistic numbers in the data sheets if you know the exact model name and where to look.\n\nOn second thought regular USB 3.0 enclosures (BOT) can limit transfer speeds and especially performance SSDs should be put into UASP enclosures. I have experience with a 2-bay enclosure that achieves decent performance (100-150 MB/s total) and an 8-bay enclosure with 6 disks achieving poor performance (60-80 MB/s total, but read speed can be higher), both are non-UASP and mounting the sets internally improves performance (2-disks only slightly, 6-disks significantly). One could fiddle with max_sectors in sysfs to optimize performance, but that could damage the filesystem and probably more with only negligible performance improvement. You will usually find non-UASP enclosures being a sufficient default for rotational media, if you want something else you better build your own.\n", "Q: Acer Aspire E14 ubuntu wifi problem I am very new in Ubuntu platform. I installed Ubuntu 14.04 in my acer Aspire E 14 laptop. I did not find proper solution to connect it with WiFi. If I go to \"Additional Drivers\" tab under  \"System Settings > Software & Update\" I can't see any drive for WiFi. There is a option of my laptop for toggling WiFi by pressing (Fn + F3), tested by pressing this but did not work. \nPlease give me proper solution how can I connect my acer laptop with WiFi.\n\nA: Please could you supply us with errors that your are receiving when trying to connect? Also I am sure that the following tutorial should point you in the right direction Fix wifi issues in ubuntu\n", "Q: please give me what commands i have to use from moving folders from one server to another server We are using ubuntu server, and I have to move folders from one server to another server:\n\nFolders: /var/www/html/demo5/site/app to /var/www/html/1/10/site\n(Where app is the folder name)\nHostnames: 123.123 to host 456.456\nUsernames: abc    to username : xyz\n\nI have SSH access, but I am new to these commands.\nI have already tried this link, but I didn't get it to work as I am new to commands.\n\nA: To copy files from a local machine to a remote machine, do something like this:\nrsync -avz --delete /path/to/local/dir/ remote_user@remote_host:/path/to/destination/dir\n(Notice that the command uses a trailing slash in /path/to/local/dir/, which you DO NOT need in /path/to/destination/dir)\nAfter you've verified that everything worked correctly, delete the source files if you don't need them anymore.\nIf you don't have rsync installed, install it first with:\nsudo apt-get install rsync\nRsync is the right tool for the job. It is very robust, can efficiently continue an interrupted copy job, and the command above will preserve the file attributes and permissions. To additionally preserve hard links, ACLs, and extended attributes, use rsync -aHAXvz.\n\nA: You can use secure copy (scp) :\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to your 123.123 host with ssh.\n\n*From here run :\n scp -r /var/www/html/demo5/site/app xyz@456.456:/var/www/html/1/10/site\n\n\n*(Optional) If you want a move,not a copy, delete the folder :\n rm -r /var/www/html/demo5/site/app\n\n\nRefer to rcp man page for more information.\n\nA: You probably just have to SSH to the first one beforehand - so after running ssh abc@123.123 (with actual username and IP address), you could run something like one of these (you probably shouldn't do both):\nscp -r /var/www/html/demo5/site/app xyx@456.456:/var/www/html/1/10/site\nrsync -auv -e ssh --progress /var/www/html/demo5/site/app xyx@456.456:/var/www/html/1/10/site\n\nNote that this will likely copy files. Before running any commands I would recommend backing up your current setup in case anything goes wrong.\nIf you want more information, you can read the manual pages of various commands using the man command - e.g. man scp, man rsync. I would also recommend looking at what options you are using before doing anything.\nN.B. Not sure but it may be easier to have one server redirect requests to the other if you just want both servers to show the same thing, unless of course you need multiple copies available.\n\nA: If you have ssh access you could use scp command.\nscp -r abc@123.123:/var/www/html/demo5/site/app zyz@456.456:/var/www/html/1/10/site\n\nI get this information from here: http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php\n", "Q: How to create local GTK3 settings?

I am currently using left alt-shift to switch between them. \nI would like though to define a specific key sequence for each one of the languages (in windows this is possible). For example, press Ctrl+1 for English, Ctrl+2 for Spanish, Ctrl+3 for German, etc. \nAnybody knows a way to do that?\n\nA: I do not think it is directly supported, but you can use the command line setxkbmap with the generic custom shortcut keys. \nYou have first of all to find the exact command that sets you keyboards; in my case I have \n setxkbmap es -variant standard_tlde \n\nfor the my custom Spanish keyboard and \n setxkbmap us -variant altgr-intl\n\nwhen I want the US-AltGr international one.

This works exactly as expected if you don't:\n$ printf \"2013\\n2013\\n2013\\n\" > year; printf \"03\\n03\\n03\\n\" \"03\" > month; printf \"08\\n09\\n10\\n\" > day\n$ for (( j=1; j <= 3; j++ )); do\n    yr=$(pl $j year)\n    mnth=$(pl $j month)\n    dy=$(pl $j day)\n    date_format=$yr-$mnth-$dy\n    echo $date_format\ndone\n2013-03-08\n2013-03-09\n2013-03-10\n\nAnd, if you add a trailing space:\n$ printf \"%s2013 \\n2013 \\n2013 \\n\" > year\n$ for (( j=1; j <= 3; j++ )); do\n>     yr=$(pl $j year)\n>     mnth=$(pl $j month)\n>     dy=$(pl $j day)\n>     date_format=$yr-$mnth-$dy\n>     echo $date_format\n> done\n2013 -03-08\n2013 -03-09\n2013 -03-10\n\nSo, the simplest solution is to remove the space from your input file:\nsed -i 's/ *$//' year\n\nNote, however, that you are using a very complex solution to a very simple problem:\n$ paste -d\"-\" year month day | tr -d ' '\n2013-03-08\n2013-03-09\n2013-03-10\n\n\nA: Remove everything after the year / month / day directly in the sed command;\nIn the pl() function replace\nsed -n \"$1p\" $2\n\nwith\nsed -n \"$1s/\\([0-9]*\\).*/\\1/p\" $2\n\n", "Q: Problem extracting data from file using awk I have a large data file and want to split it into smaller files based on values in column 1.\nFor example column 1 has numbers from 1 to 10 ten times to make 100 rows and I want all lines with numbers '1' or '2' or '3' etc in their own file (preferably without sorting). \nAlso I dont want to run the command 10 times so would like for it to be in a loop.\nMy files look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*text.txt\n\n\n*ID.txt\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nThe command I tried: \ncat ID.txt | while read line; do awk '$1 == ${line}' test.txt >$line.txt;done\n\nSo to summarize I want it to read the value from the ID.txt file e.g '1' and then extract all rows with '1' in the first line and put it in a file called 1.txt, then it iterates to 2 then 3 then 4 etc.\nBut somehow the '$1 == ${line}' part I think is not working \n\nA: You are looking for the -v option to awk:\n   -v var=val\n   --assign var=val\n          Assign the value val to the variable var,  before  execution  of\n          the  program  begins.  Such variable values are available to the\n          BEGIN rule of an AWK program.\n\nSomething like this:\ncat ID.txt | \n    while read line; do awk -vline=\"$line\" '$1 == l' test.txt >\"$line\".txt;done\n\nWhich would be better expressed as (avoiding the useless use of cat):\nwhile read line; do \n    awk -vline=\"$line\" '$1 == l' test.txt >\"$line\".txt;\ndone < ID.txt\n\nHowever, this is very slow and inefficient. You are running the awk command on the entire test.txt for each line of ID.txt. Why not just read ID.txt in awk itself and print the matching lines:\nawk 'NR==FNR{a[$1]++; next} ($1 in a){print >> $1\".txt\"}' ID.txt test.txt \n\nThe above saves the 1st field of ID.txt in the array a. NR and FNR are special awk variables meaning \"the current line of the input stream\" and \"the current line of the current file\". The two will only be equal to each other when the first file is being read. Therefore, NR==FNR{a[$1]++; next} will only be run on the lines of the first file. The second part will not be executed because the next tells awk to skip to the next line. \nThe second part, checks if the current line's 1st field (remember, this is only run on the second file) exists in the array a (which means it was in ID.txt) and, if it does, prints the line into a file called \"field1.txt\"\n", "Q: How to Dual Boot Windows 10 & Ubuntu 15.04 Both On Separate Drives?

There is no way that Xorg know them dynamically only from monitor DDC data. Otherwise, you have to get a common frequency for monitors you have.\nThe fallback frequencies are: (man xorg.conf)   \n\nHorizSync  horizsync-range\ngives the range(s) of horizontal sync frequencies supported by the monitor.  horizsync-range may  be  a  comma  separated  list of           either  discrete  values  or  ranges of values.

The data given here is used by the Xorg  server to determine if video modes are within the specifications of the monitor.  This information should be available in the monitor's handbook.

The action to move the window is set to alt+F7 but alt+left-click works so it must be set somewhere.\nDoes anyone here know where this setting can be changed apart from the keyboard settings menu as it does not allow mouse clicks to be registered as shortcuts?\n\nA: Here's a one-liner to do it. Open a terminal and paste this:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/resize-with-right-button true\n\nNo need to install ccsm.\n\nA: This setting should be set in ccsm.

My laptop was locked (showing lightdm unlock screen), and the battery went off overnight.\nWhen I charged it up again there is the lightdm or gnome window asking me the session-end question \"user, you have open files...\" with the buttons to lock, sleep, restart, shutdown, and a close button on the top. It looks like this, but without mouse over highlights, and with my user unlock UI on the back. Also the top message  says \nUser, you have open files you might want to save. Would you like to...\" \n\nBut I cannot click anywhere so I cannot get out of it. I tried going to the console, but the lightdm main process probably owns the window. I can't kill that one or i will lose the session.

In order to save some data before, I tried to access to my hard disc using a Live CD. I was able to copy some files to an external flash memory, but I couldn't copy many other because according to Ubuntu I'm not the owner of those files and I don't have enough permissions. How can I be able to copy those files? Thanks\n\nA: You can become owner of a file very easily. Simply do\nsudo chown (user) /directory/path/to/file\n\nNote that (user) is probably going to be Ubuntu since you are on a live CD, and that /directory/path/to/file should obviously be replaced  with the file's directory path.\nChown standing for Change-Owner, this will make the Ubuntu live CD the owner of the file. Once you have your new installation you can obviously reverse this with\nsudo chown (new_username) /directory/path/to/file\n\nSo that your new user can access the files.\n", "Q: Open file by mouse click on file path in terminal Is there a terminal, or a tool that allows to have the following feature when working in a terminal?

I never had problems with NVIDIA drivers and Ubuntu. Usually the card is detected and the OS gives you the option to use the NVIDIA driver. Maybe you did this yet, but as you don't say anything about how you tried to install the drivers, I supposed that you tried to do it manually.\n\nA: NVIDIA has fixed many issues and improved their drivers a lot since the release of drivers 346.  \nSo install the latest NVIDIA drivers supporting GTX 660 from the Proprietary GPU drivers PPA.  \nBefore you install new drivers uninstall all NVIDIA related software you have installed before.  \nOpen a terminal and execute :\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*  \nsudo reboot\n\nThen install the latest current stable NVIDIA drivers from the short-lived branch by executing :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-355 \nsudo reboot  \n\nIn case you are using a notebook with a hybrid graphics solution install Optimus support as well.  \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-prime  \n\nWhen experiencing problems add nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line before booting into Ubuntu (press \"e\" in GRUB menu entry - add the parameter - then press F10 ).\n", "Q: Require SSH passphrase with each use I regularly use Ubuntu's ssh command to connect to a server that I administrate (I even have a .desktop setup for it).

The sorts of problems that Windows partitioning tools create can often be fixed with less drastic measures. For experts, wonders can be worked with fdisk or sfdisk. For those of intermediate skill, my own FixParts (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) can fix many problems. See the FixParts documentation for information on how to use it. This Ubuntu forums thread has some basic information on using sfdisk to fix problems. That said, unless I've misread your output, I don't think FixParts will be able to recover all your partitions -- at least, not by itself. sfdisk could probably do it, but that will take more expertise.\nUnfortunately, since you presented no information on what your partition table currently looks like, I'm working blind on some critical details. I recommend you read the links I've provided (and especially my FixParts page), compare it to what you've got, and perhaps see what these tools make of your disk. If you want more help, edit your question to include the output of sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and add a comment to this answer to flag my attention.\nAs to the problem you're facing, my suspicion is that the cause is that you're trying to recover two partitions as being logical when there are no free sectors between them. The usual structure of an MBR disk requires at least one free sector in-between any two logical partitions, so what you're trying to do won't work. (Some tools, such as sfdisk, have ways around this limitation, but most will choke on it.) Given your disk layout, it may not be possible to include all your partitions in an MBR setup except by first resizing one or two partitions. Depending on the current partition state, that may be an extremely dangerous proposition.\nAnother possibility might be to convert to GPT. (Or perhaps the disk was originally -- and perhaps still is -- in GPT form, and you just told TestDisk you wanted to use MBR?) GPT doesn't have the gap-between-partitions issue of MBR, so you should be able to include all your partitions in this form. The downside is that if the disk currently uses MBR and successfully boots Windows, you'll have to jump through some hoops to get Windows booting in EFI mode. (You'll also need a computer with EFI/UEFI firmware.) Even if the disk currently uses MBR, converting to GPT might enable you to resize partitions. You could then convert back to MBR to get Windows booting again. Any such conversion -- even a temporary one -- would be likely to require you to re-install boot loaders.\nWhatever you do, do not make changes to your partition table until you fully understand what's going on. Many people in situations similar to yours have done irreparable harm to their data by rushing in with an inadequate understanding of the problem. Also, if you don't already have good backups, make them. Even a competent person could easily end up losing data trying to fix your problem.\n\nEDIT:\nGiven the new information you've presented, it appears that Windows has completely erased two partitions from your partition table. The good news is that you've got excellent data on the start and end points of the filesystems, so you should be able to recover. (The fact that TestDisk found filesystems means that your data are probably intact, just inaccessible.)\nNo matter how you do this, I strongly recommend that you begin by making a complete low-level backup of the disk. If my calculations are correct, your disk is 700GiB in size, so you should be able to do a backup onto a disk with at least that much free space with a command like this:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/lots/of/space/backup-sda.img bs=4096\n\nThis operation is likely to take a few hours to complete. Be very careful with this command, and in particular with the if= and of= options, which specify the input and output files, respectively. With that done....\nIIRC, sfdisk can create an extended partition with logical partitions that have no space between them, so you can try recovering by first creating an sfdisk text file with the following command:\nsfdisk -d /dev/sda > partitions-sda.txt\n\nThe contents of partitions-sda.txt should be similar to the first block of output on your spreadsheet. You can then load that file into a text editor and add information on your two missing partitions. The tricky parts are the start and size values, but you seem to have already computed them, so you just need to create appropriate lines for them with the right values specified. You'll also need to adjust the start point for the extended partition so that it contains your two \"new\" (recovered) partitions. When you're done, you can write the result back out to disk:\nsfdisk -f /dev/sda < partitions-sda.txt\n\nThis should work. If it doesn't, though, then you may have made a mistake, or perhaps I'm mistaken about sfdisk's capabilities, or maybe sfdisk has changed.\nOnce this is done, I recommend checking your filesystems. You may also want to shrink the end of the first Ubuntu partition so that there's a small gap between it and the next one. You can probably do this with GParted -- although it's possible that GParted will refuse to work on the disk because of this issue. In this case, you may need to back up the partition, delete it, create a new one in its place, and restore the data.\nAn alternative to this procedure is to buy a new disk and copy the partitions over one at a time. You can even use dd with the skip option to read the \"lost\" filesystems from the disk without re-creating partitions around them -- but you must be very precise when specifying the start points.\nYet another alternative is to use TestDisk to recover the first Linux partition, shrink it slightly with GParted, and then run TestDisk again to recover the second Linux partition. This should work, but there's a small chance that TestDisk or GParted with write something to the area occupied by the second filesystem while it's officially unallocated, thus damaging it.\nTelling TestDisk to recover the disk as GPT is yet another option, but that will render Windows unbootable, at least until you jump through more hoops. If your computer is BIOS-based (rather than EFI-based, as most post-2011 computers are), you won't be able to boot Windows at all from GPT. If you go with this option, you'll need to write a new boot loader to the disk.\n\nEDIT 2:\nIn response to your latest questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you'd reverse the dd command to restore the backup.\n\n*Note that the first sfdisk command I presented used a -d option and the second used a -f option.\n\n*The whole point of using sfdisk is that, IIRC, it's one of the rare programs that can create two logical partitions with no space between them. It does this by writing EBRs consecutively on the disk, before either logical partition. Although EBRs are important disk data structures, you shouldn't normally be trying to modify them by hand; just let sfdisk (or GParted or whatever) handle them.\n\n*My guess is that your Linux partitions were originally primaries and Windows deleted them; but maybe they were logicals that were created by sfdisk or something else that can create two logical partitions next to each other, and when the Windows partitioner saw that it choked and deleted them rather than try to create something it couldn't.\n\n\nA: Mission accomplished ! I have used TestDisk to successfully restore all my partitions. Having said that, I have to confess that I was a bit lucky. Yesterday, I launched TestDisk after having not used it during a few days. For an unknown reason, the application behaved differently compared to the way it used to behave: indeed, TestDisk take at least one minute to display the “Quick Search” screen whereas it was immediately displayed the previous times I used it. During this minute, the TestDisk screen displays the values of the Start and End points of each partition. However, during this minute, the End point values of the first Linux partitions were values that were never given by any other TestDisk screen or by any other command or application before. I had the feeling that those values, which were temporarily displayed, were the correct ones: the point is that those values allowed having space between the two Linux / Logical partitions.\nThen, I edited a Log TestDisk file, which is a simple ASCII file. I added two new lines to this text file: those lines were about the two missing Logical partitions. Naturally, for the first Linux partitions, I entered the End point values that had just mysteriously appeared just before the “Quick Search” screen. The next step was to load the updated log file in TestDisk. The Disk Structure was immediately accepted by the application. Then, I only had to ask to TestDisk to rewrite the partitions table by taking into consideration the values given by the Log file. After that, I just had to restart my computer, to launch Boot-Repair from an Ubuntu Live-CD session, to restart again my computer and at last, to use a working GRUB, to launch Ubuntu and to enjoy Ubuntu, which was back to life!\nFor information, the values that were finally used to successfully rewrite the partitions table with TestDisk are available here at the very end of the first sheet (\"Feuil1\"): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16bOgee0CIObZORWjyKw7l7do8czfdfB5PEGZj6OhWjc/edit?usp=sharing\n\nA: Look at the start and end sectors in your screenshots, please. In the first one you select the first Linux partition of which the structure is apparently bad. In the second screenshot you select the Linux swap file which is good. In the third screenshot you select the second Linux partition which is also OK. According to your screenshots you never select two partitions at the same time. AFAIK it is impossible to select two partitions at the same time so you can't even do that.\nSo you have to repair your first Linux partition only.

This will not\n  discard precision (at least only on nv-reset, see Velocity\n  approximation or below).\nIf your high-performance device does not repond well to acceleration,\n  you might need to reduce velocity scaling first.\nIf you like the speed but need some more control at pixel-level, you\n  should set ?AdaptiveDeceleration to 2 or more. This allows to\n  decelerate slow movements down to the given factor. You might want to\n  keep nv-resets away by setting ?VelocityReset to e.g. 500 ms, and\n  maybe tweak velocity scaling to tune results.\n\nStep 1 - Find the device id: (as in @edward-torvalds answer)\n(lf-env) craig@craig-desktop:~/work/leaflet-1$ xinput --list --short\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ MOSART Semi. 2.4G Wireless Mouse          id=11   [slave  pointer  \n\nMy mouse is id==11, this number can be used for setting properties.  Field names can also be used.  When writing commands to a startup file, field names should be used because device ids can change dynamically (c.f.  here ).\nStep 2 - Find the current device settings and the property id numbers:\n(lf-env) craig@craig-desktop:~/work/leaflet-1$ xinput -list-props 11\nDevice 'MOSART Semi. 2.4G Wireless Mouse':\n    ...\n    Device Accel Profile (262): 0\n    Device Accel Constant Deceleration (263):   1.000000\n    Device Accel Adaptive Deceleration (264):   1.000000\n    Device Accel Velocity Scaling (265):    10.000000\n    ...\n\nThe properties I finally decided to adjust are as follows:\nDevice Accel Constant Deceleration (263):   [original value 1.0]\nDevice Accel Adaptive Deceleration (264):   [original value 1.0]\nDevice Accel Velocity Scaling (265):            [original value 100.0]\n\nThe online documentation mentioned above gives descriptions of these values.  Here I add some description based on subjective \"feeling\" and that documentation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Device Accel Constant Deceleration (263):\n-- Mouse sensitivity.  Lower settings are slower.  Feels like mouse velocity is divided by this factor.\n\n*Device Accel Adaptive Deceleration (264):\n-- When mouse is moving at low speeds, the velocity is further divided by this factor.  The overall feeling is having two seperate gears, lo-gear and high-gear.  In my personal case, I got the best result by matching the settings with a physiological gearing:  for lo-gear my palm-heel is down and I am making fine mouse movements with my finger muscles.  For high gear, my palm-heel is up or sliding and I am making broad movements with arm muscles while gripping the mouse firmly.  It can be a little tricky controlling the transition - if there were another input to tell whether the palm-heel was up/sliding or down/fixed it would be perfect!\n\n*Device Accel Velocity Scaling (265): \n-- This factor divides the raw numerical data, acting like \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" but also throwing away integer resolution. ? Maybe.\nMy current settings are as follows:\n(lf-env) craig@craig-desktop:~/work/leaflet-1$ xinput -set-prop 11 263 10\n(lf-env) craig@craig-desktop:~/work/leaflet-1$ xinput -set-prop 11 264 1000\n(lf-env) craig@craig-desktop:~/work/leaflet-1$ xinput -set-prop 11 265 10\n\n(lf-env) craig@craig-desktop:~/work/leaflet-1$ xinput -list-props 11\nDevice 'MOSART Semi. 2.4G Wireless Mouse':\n...\n    Device Accel Profile (262): 0\n    Device Accel Constant Deceleration (263):   10.000000\n    Device Accel Adaptive Deceleration (264):   1000.000000\n    Device Accel Velocity Scaling (265):    10.000000\n...\n\n", "Q: How to prevent mail sent from Mutt from winding up in junk folders? I have mutt configured to send/receive mail on behalf of an email address on a domain that I own (i.e., not a gmail, yahoo or other major domain). I'm attempting to set up a notification system to send brief emails to clients. Outgoing mail goes through an SMTP server with TLS.\nHowever, in my testing so far, every single email I've sent to myself ends up in my junk email. This only happens with mutt; using my mail client on my phone, the same message correctly goes to the inbox.

I added a command @reboot and it works. \nBut this particular code doesn't seem to work at startup (whether I put it in crontab, rc.local, init.d, or as a startup application)\nBelow is my UDP server code\nimport socket\nimport serial\nimport subprocess\n\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n\nserver_address = (192.168.1.13, 10000)\nprint 'starting up on %s port %s' % server_address\nsock.bind(server_address)\n\nser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttymxc3', 115200, timeout = 0)\nprint 'Serial connected'\n\nwhile True:\n    data = sock.recv(7)\n    print 'received ', data\n    if data == \"STOP\":\n        subprocess.call([\"sudo\", \"shutdown\", \"-h\", \"now\"])\n    else:\n        ser.write(data)\n\nWhen I run this at the command line it works something like this\nstarting up on 192.168.1.13 port 10000\nSerial connected\n\nThen the program waits for a connection.\nIf I have my UDP Client send STOP\nreceived 'STOP'\n\nThe computer then shuts down.\nBut when the code is run at startup and I send 'STOP' via the UDP Client the computer doesn't shut down.

I don't know if you've all heard/read about the software from companies such as \"hacking team\", see e.g. the remote control system:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/files/0/31_200810-ISS-PRG-HACKINGTEAM.pdf\n\n*http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/hacking-team/\n\n*hackingteam.it - and many other pages\n\n\nI was a bit surprised about how easy it is for everyone to use such a tool to hack everything. What they do is to have a really really simply tool (the interface is simple, obviously the security penetration is for highly specialized hackers) that even idiots can use, to hack other people's computer - ALSO LINUX. So Linux is not safe.\nFor me, I normally don't click links in emails. I don't download pirate software. But I think if somebody should use such a tool against me, they should setup a webpage and after I've visited this webpage my pc would be injected. It's not that I have anything to hide, it's just I want to protect my pc against criminals and get the highest possibly security.\nSo I've been thinking about \"sandboxing\" my mozilla browser and chromium browser. I think that should make me >95% more safe, as this is where I imagine criminals potentially could take over my pc. Do you agree that sandboxing the browser is the best defense against criminals taking over one's pc? Exactly which tools/methods are recommended for increasing the security level against such dangerous attacks (they're invisible to virus/malware scanners and exploit 0-day vulnerabilities)?\nI also have wireshark, but I'm not clever enough and haven't learned how to analyze my own IP traffic to look for such things in my home network although I would like to learn more about how to detect such attacks. I think this is indeed a very interesting topic, I hope to hear/read good guidelines other than just \"don't click links in emails which is suspicious\"...\n\nA: I have heard that the Secret Services of several counties are moving back to a paper system. Honestly if informations systems security is your goal you should consider learning about \"The Tor Anonymity Project,\" and \"The Tails Amnesic Incognito Live System.\" You should probably also know how to implement \"GNU Privacy Guard,\" and the GPG Tools Suite that goes along with your OS distribution, and your email application. Unfortunate no current computer system should be considered 100% secure. Even systems that have been \"air gaped\" from a network can be, and have been compromised. The best we can hope for is keeping really critical information in a drawer, or in our heads. ----Best of Luck!\n", "Q: Text missing / garbled after laptop resumes from sleep mode I am on the Thinkpad T450s. I'm on Ubuntu version 15.10 and kernel version 3.19.0-15-generic.\nEverything works great except the following issue. Each time I re-open the lid of the laptop after it has been shut (i.e. after it resumes from sleep mode), Ubuntu is completely unusable. Text rarely renders, most UI elements are missing the text, and even if any text is present, it's usually garbled with strange characters. I'm not even able to type in the terminal. The only solution has been to restart which fixes everything, only for me to shut the lid again. This happens reliably, every time the lid is shut. I use two different window managers, the default Unity (Desktop Environment) and also Awesome-WM.

It started with the GNU GRUB boot loader (or something like that).\nThere are options in GRUB to boot Ubuntu or choose from advanced options, and Windows does show up. The problem: I can't select an option because my keyboard doesn't work. I have tried everything that I can find and it doesn't work. The closest I've gotten is using something called \"EFIBOOTMNG\" that can set priority or an order of the bootloaders, but when i input \nochipi@Ubuntu-Phoenix:~$ efibootmgr\n\nI get this:\nBootCurrent: 0001\nTimeout: 1 seconds\nBootOrder: 0001,0000,0006,0002,0003,0004,0005\nBoot0000* Windows Boot Manager\nBoot0001* ubuntu\nBoot0002* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell \nBoot0003* UEFI:CD/DVD Drive\nBoot0004* UEFI:Removable Device\nBoot0005* UEFI:Network Device\nBoot0006* ubuntu\n\nI put this in to change the order:\nochipi@Ubuntu-Phoenix:~$ efibootmgr -o 0000,0001,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006\n\n(I'm trying to set the priority to the Windows Boot manager)\nBut I get this error:\nefibootmgr: Could not remove entry from BootOrder: Permission denied\n\nSo... what should I do? I want to use Windows too. I cant set anything in the UEFI BIOS (or firmware, as Windows likes to call it :P)\nI have an MSI h81m e-33 that (as I know) does not have a key to enter the BIOS setup.\nI don't want to format my PC, because I have too much important things on it. Can anyone help me to set the Windows Boot Manager as the \"default\" or favorite boot manager (and not GRUB)?\n\nA: You just need to run efibootmgr with sudo, so that it has permission to update the firmware settings.

When you put relayhost in config all mail from your server will be routed to relayhost.\n\nA: It seems that smart host (mail relay) you use (mail.mycompany.com) rejects SMTP connections from your host.\nBased on reject procedure it may reject them due to tcpwrappers configuration.\n", "Q: set up two factor authentication with Google but only if a public key is not used I have key setup from host1 to host2 and host2 to host1 for SSH.

My idea is to use Linux more frequently but I am experiencing some issues. The most important thing I wish to fix is the WiFi because of the OS recognizes the device but after a few minutes it closes the connection and I have to reboot. My idea is that I have to install a different driver which is compatible with the device. \nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: When you say it closes the connection, does it actually disconnect from the network or do you just mean the internet stops working? I had an issue on an older machine (using Ubuntu 12.04) where it would remain connected, but the internet would not work.\nFor some reason Ubuntu was not playing well with my ISPs DNS servers, so I changed it to use the Google ones and that fixed the problem. (To change your DNS server click the WiFi icon at the top, click edit connections, select your network, and go to the ipv4 tab)\nIf the computer fully disconnects from the network (cant even ping the router), then you have a different problem. In which case, what WiFi card are you using, and have you tried checking for a proprietary driver?

I've intentionally left out 14.04 in hopes of getting answers unspecific to any particular version(s).\n\nIt seems I haven't described what I want simply enough, I think these two points would take care of the above:\n\n\n*\n\n*purge all auto-installed packages (@kos answered that on @Fabby's answer)\n\n*install the packages that makes up a fresh Ubuntu install\n\n\nAnd I'm guessing if the dependencies of manually installed packages do get uninstalled, apt-get -f will help me with them.\n\nA: For the future: \nIf you have a remote server in a Data centre 1000 miles away you'd better have an IPKVM switch installed so you don't have to rely solely on ssh to reach it. \nIf the server is on Mount Everest: add an Iridium phone and a modem as well...\nThen you can have a bootable 512MB FAT CloneZilla partition on that machine (I use an SLC USB stick) and use the console to boot to that and back-up an image of your system partition(s) to your data drive and then copy the previous system image on the secondary partition of your USB stick before you start adding trusty-proposed to the server. (I keep most of my system back-ups on the data drive: they're only 6GB)\nFor now: \n\n\n*\n\n*Take an apt-backup\n\n*Go through your /var/log/apt/history*\n\n*Make your own automagical script that does an apt-get purge of all the stuff you really don't want/need any more from the data in the previous step\n\n*Execute the script while praying to Linus of the Torvalds \n\n*Update your repositories like you want them to be (like removing trusty-proposed)\n\n*Reboot while praying to Richard of the Stallmans\n\n*If everything works out: implement the IPKVM switch solution above.\n\n\nA: OK, My answer assumes you can, and have backed up your user directory, and everything you want to save. which reduces your question to how do I install Ubuntu on a remote server? To which there are many solutions. \nFor this, you could use DRBL, to remotely deploy an operating system, with a variety of options for booting. You can look into it here: http://drbl.org/installation/\nThere is Clobber: \nhttp://cobbler.github.io/manuals/quickstart/\nThere is cloneZilla,  which can back up and restore over a network.\nThe link is for windows, but the same methods apply for linux. Alternatively, you could make an ubuntu boot image locally, and install it using clonezilla.\nhttp://opensourceforu.efytimes.com/2013/12/restore-partitions-network-using-clonezilla/\nAlternatively, you could try using dd_rescue, or netcat\nA useful search term might be \"Server Provisioning\". There are more options then these.  \nThere are bruteforce methods too.  \n$ ls /\nbin  boot  cdrom  dev  etc  home  initrd.img  initrd.img.old  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var  vmlinuz  vmlinuz.old\n\nand your PATH were like this:\necho $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nif your root directory were something like this, if you over wrote /etc, and /usr with \"clean\" versions, you would be overwriting, pretty much every piece of installed software, and the config files for it. That would be hackerish to say the least, if not a completely horrible idea. Running apt-get purge would be much safer,  Or perhaps you could fine tune the process a little bit. You might then also want to include a clone of your old ssh config file in /etc/ssh/ before trying to restart the services with new config files.  \nThere is also a tool that lets you dump a running kernel and upgrade without rebooting. For that you could check out Kslpice, or kGraft\nIf all you are having trouble with is repos and package management, I'm not sure why you would want to dump the kernel, mbr, boot partition etc.. \nSo any how, I hope Ive given you some ideas to look into. There are many ways to depoly a server remotely.  \n", "Q: How to install wine?

Each time I boot it I need to set radeon to 0, or use nomodeset. I don't have the fglrx drivers (the Trusty kernel and X.org does not support it), only the open ones. Each time I boot as normal, I get the screen turned off, nothing works. Tried to use everything, editing GRUB (before you ask, yes, I sudo update-grub'd it), adding a xorg.conf file (but it gets renamed each boot)...\nUseful info: graphic card is ATI Radeon HD 4670. I don't want to use the nomodeset option, just to get my graphics to work.\nIf you need some log info or so, I'll attach it.\n\nA: this Question ist older, but I found a some how working solution I could not find for this context in any other answers to this problem.\nI expirienced an similar behavior when booting up Kubuntu 16.10 on an iMac (late 2009) since a few weeks:\nThe system is running but the backlight is switched off some how at that moment when the framebuffer driver is activated.\nIt started after using the external displayport or an kubuntu-update I can not tell which. The nomodeset/...modeset=0 thing somehow works but then the radeon driver isn't loaded anymore and things that benifit a lot from hardware accelleration like googelmaps are not usable or only usable with pain.\nAt the moment I only have a solution for X: \nSSH ssh username@yourImacIP -XC (-XC means: compressed with X-forwarding) to the iMac and run:\nxrandr -d :0 --output eDP --crtc 1 --brightness 0.8\n\nThis how ever only works if I start the normal X-Displaymanager/Desktop-environment (in my case KDE) on the iMac.  So i have to assume that the correct useraccount is allready selected and I only have to type in the password blindly. Of course xrandr must be installed.\nIf I run the same command again - the screen turns black and if again the screens turns on again. So the logic of the command as I understand it (changing the brightness to a value between 0 and 1) is not working correct.\nIf anyone has a solution for the framebuffer-bootup not turning off the monitor-backlight I would appreciate it. \nUpdate:\nAfter the upgrade to kubuntu 17.10 the radeon driver didn't work at all in this setup.\nBut (current) happy end: with the latest updates (around middle of November) of the current Version of Kubuntu (17.10) the described procedures above seems not necessary anymore! \nThe Display comes up without any hassle and I can use the console again. Thank the almighty kubuntu or radeon-driver developers!\nStill not working is my external display port :( The hardware seems to be gone...\nIf you still need the procedure above - attaching the line \nxrandr -d :0 --output eDP --crtc 1 --brightness 0.7\n\nto your local (in your user directory) *.xinit, .xinitrc or .xsessionrc* (whatever works) eases your live.

What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Even dual booting, its unlikely that you have 10 partitions on sda, so /dev/sda10 is probably incorrect. (Because of primary/secondary partitions there could be as little as 7, but my point remains.) I would run\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nto try and identify for sure what partition your Windows drive is on. It should have type NTFS.\nAnother option if you have a full desktop installed, would be to browse to the drive using the file manager. This will automatically mount it under /media/$yourusername. You can then use the df command to see what partition it mounted and use that in your fstab instead of /dev/sda10\n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu My Ubuntu 10.10 is no longer supported. Some programs like Update Manager will not open. And a bunch of other Ubuntu programs. I was wondering if it would work if I:\n1: Got an 8GB USB flash drive\n2: Correctly put Ubuntu 14.04.3 on the USB flash drive\n3: Plugged the USB flash drive (with Ubuntu on it) in the computer that runs the faulty Ubuntu\n\n\n*Installed it and totally get rid of Ubuntu 10.10\n\n*Ran the new Ubuntu\nWould this work? Because I figured that it would because it is just like installing any other Ubuntu.\nToday (10-22-15) I will be going out to buy a USB flash drive! Please leave a response if you read this.\n\nA: \nthe easier way I think is like this:\n1. Launch the Software Updater\nPress the Superkey (Windows key) to launch the Dash and search for Update Manager\n2. Check for updates\nSelect the tab called \"Updates\". Then set the \"Notify me of a new Ubuntu version\" dropdown menu to \"For any new version\". Press Alt+F2 and type in \"update-manager\" (without the quotes) into the command box. The Update Manager should open up and tell you: New distribution release '15.04' is available. Click Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions.\n3.

Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so that effectively not more than one (or more, if  preload  is set)  unanswered  probe  is  present in the network. Minimal interval is 200msec for not super-user. On networks with low rtt this mode is essentially equivalent to flood mode.\n\nThis is what i had seen in ping manual page what this means exactly please explain me in simple terms.\n\nA: Typically, ping requests are sent across the network at a set interval, usually 1 second. This is configurable with the -i flag. Generally, this means a full ping request and response occurs, then the tool does nothing for the rest of that second. In extremely bad network conditions, a new ping request could go out before the last one is returned.\nAdaptive ping (-A) tries to adjust the interval to the RTT of the network link. This way, on average, a new ping request goes out as soon as the last reply is received.\nBoth of these are in contrast to flood mode, which sends out as many requests as possible with no delay or attention to the RTT.\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes when connecting to Wifi hotspot When ever I try to connect to WIFI hotspot, ubuntu freezes.\nBy hotspot I mean wifi network where you first connect to the network without password then enter it in a dedicated page of a web browser.\nBy freeze I mean that the only action I can do is alt+sys+REISUB\nI can connect to my wifi at home without any issue, or to the wifi of my smartphone when sharing connection.

You define it by executing the following line in your terminal session. note that you may chose any valid bash variable name instead of runandlog:\nrunandlog () ( IFS=' '; printf \"[%s] $ %s\\n%s\\n\" \"$USER\" \"${*:2}\" \"$(\"${@:2}\")\" | tee -a \"$1\" | tail -n +2; )\n\nThis however only persists for the current Bash session, that means after closing the terminal window, the function will be gone.\nIf you tried and liked it though, you can make it always available by editing your ~/.bashrc file and appending this line to the end of it.\nHow to use:\nAfter having defined the function, you may use it to run commands while logging both the command itself and its output to a file. You could even add more information like the user who executed it, which I already included into the function, or exact time it was ran. Feature-requests in comments are welcome! :)\nThe syntax is simple:\nrunandlog LOGFILENAME YOUR-COMMAND-WITH-ARGUMENTS\n\nExample:\nAn example session as user bytecommander, operating from the home directory could look like this:\nbytecommander: ~ $  runandlog mylogfile fortune\nA mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.\n        -- P. Erdos\n\nWhich will result in a new file mylogfile (if it already exists, the function will append the output to it!) in the current directory with the content:\n[bytecommander] $ fortune \nA mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.\n        -- P. Erdos\n\n\nA: A fairly unclever but functional trick would be:\n(echo \"apt-cache depends kde-window-manager\" && apt-cache depends kde-window-manager) > ~/Desktop/kwin-depends\n\nUgly, but it works!\n\nA: You could simply pass the command to a function which will print the command first and the command's output afterwards (the redirections are kept out of the printed command intentionally, you may easily change this by removing the quotes from the command and by printing and running $@ instead of $1 in the function):\nfunction myfunction() {\n    printf \"%s\\n\\n\" \"$1\"\n    $1\n}\n\n$ myfunction \"printf \\\"bar\\n\\\"\" > foo\n$ cat foo\nprintf \"bar\\n\"\n\nbar\n\nTo add the command afterwards you could run this command, which will insert the last command run at the top of a file:\n<<<\"$(<foo)\" cat <(history 2 | sed -n '1s/  [0-9][0-9]*  \\(.*\\)/\\1\\n/p') - >foo\n\n\n\n*\n\n*<<<\"[...]\": here string; [...] is redirected to cat's stdin;\n\n*$(<foo): command substitution; it's replaced with \"foo\"'s content;\n\n*cat [...] - >foo: concatenates stdin to [...] and outputs to \"foo\";\n\n*<([...]): process substitution: it's replaced with a file descriptor containing the output of [...];\n\n*history 2 | sed -n '1s/  [0-9][0-9]*  \\(.*\\)/\\1\\n/p': outputs the last two commands, removes two spaces followed by one or more digits followed by two spaces from the first line and prints it;\n\n\n$ printf \"bar\\n\" >foo\n$ <<<\"$(<foo)\" cat <(history 2 | sed -n '1s/  [0-9][0-9]*  \\(.*\\)/\\1\\n/p') - >foo\n$ cat foo\nprintf \"bar\" >foo\n\nbar\n\n\nA: I would just use a simple function. Add this to your ~/.bashrc file:\nfunction runcom(){\n    echo \"$@\"\n    ## Run the command\n    $@\n}\n\nNow, whenever you want to run a command and print it, you can do:\nruncom apt-cache depends kde-window-manager > out\n\nThe above produces this file:\n$ cat out\napt-cache depends kde-window-manager\nkde-window-manager\n  Depends: perl\n  Depends: kde-runtime\n  Depends: kde-style-oxygen\n  Depends: libc6\n |Depends: libegl1-mesa\n  Depends: <libegl1-x11>\n    libegl1-mesa\n  Depends: libgcc1\n |Depends: libgl1-mesa-glx\n  Depends: <libgl1>\n    libgl1-mesa-swx11\n    libgl1-mesa-glx\n |Depends: libgles2-mesa\n  Depends: <libgles2>\n    libgles2-mesa\n  Depends: libice6\n  Depends: libkactivities6\n  Depends: libkcmutils4\n  Depends: libkdeclarative5\n  Depends: libkdecorations4abi2\n  Depends: libkdecore5\n  Depends: libkdeui5\n  Depends: libkio5\n  Depends: libknewstuff3-4\n  Depends: libkwineffects1abi5\n  Depends: libkwinglesutils1\n  Depends: libkwinglutils1abi2\n  Depends: libkworkspace4abi2\n  Depends: libplasma3\n  Depends: libqt4-dbus\n  Depends: libqt4-declarative\n  Depends: libqt4-script\n  Depends: libqtcore4\n  Depends: libqtgui4\n  Depends: libsm6\n  Depends: libstdc++6\n  Depends: libwayland-client0\n |Depends: libwayland-egl1-mesa\n  Depends: <libwayland-egl1>\n    libwayland-egl1-mesa\n  Depends: libx11-6\n  Depends: libx11-xcb1\n  Depends: libxcb-composite0\n  Depends: libxcb-damage0\n  Depends: libxcb-image0\n  Depends: libxcb-keysyms1\n  Depends: libxcb-randr0\n  Depends: libxcb-render0\n  Depends: libxcb-shape0\n  Depends: libxcb-shm0\n  Depends: libxcb-sync1\n  Depends: libxcb-xfixes0\n  Depends: libxcb-xtest0\n  Depends: libxcb1\n  Depends: libxcursor1\n  Depends: libxext6\n  Depends: libxrandr2\n  Depends: libxxf86vm1\n  Breaks: kde-style-bespin\n  Breaks: kde-style-bespin:i386\n  Breaks: <kde-style-skulpture>\n  Breaks: <kde-style-skulpture:i386>\n  Breaks: kde-workspace-data\n  Breaks: <kde-workspace-data:i386>\n  Breaks: kdeartwork-theme-window\n  Breaks: kdeartwork-theme-window:i386\n  Breaks: <kdebase-workspace-data>\n  Breaks: <kdebase-workspace-data:i386>\n  Breaks: kwin-style-crystal\n  Breaks: kwin-style-crystal:i386\n  Breaks: kwin-style-dekorator\n  Breaks: kwin-style-dekorator:i386\n  Breaks: kwin-style-qtcurve\n  Breaks: kwin-style-qtcurve:i386\n  Replaces: kde-workspace-data\n  Replaces: <kde-workspace-data:i386>\n  Replaces: <kdebase-workspace-data>\n  Replaces: <kdebase-workspace-data:i386>\n  Conflicts: kde-window-manager:i386\n\n\nA: Most minimalistic - approach #4 and #3, both could be converted  into function;  #2 my favorite - awk. #1 uses script command - very versatile tool, useful for recording command line in general; applicable anywhere, for whatever you want to record.\nApproach #1:\nThere is a /usr/bin/script command ( which comes with ubuntu by default ) for recording command-line output, which captures everything , along with the prompt and command.

But the script works just on my UbuntuDesktop. On my Nexus 4 I get the error 'Permission Denied'Denied' (of course I used sudo)of\nCan anybody help me to execute the script or to install theof manually?\nLink: \nhttp://www.fh-kiel.de/fileadmin/data/Zentrale_IT/WLANeduroam/linux/2014-05-eduroam-linux-Fachhochschule_Kiel-Fachhochschule_Kiel.sh\n\nA: man update-ca-certificates:\nupdate-ca-certificates  is  a  program  that  updates   the   directory\n/etc/ssl/certs to hold SSL certificates and generates certificates.crt,\na concatenated single-file list of certificates.\nIt reads the file /etc/ca-certificates.conf. Each line gives a pathname\nof  a  CA  certificate  under /usr/share/ca-certificates that should be\ntrusted.  Lines that begin with \"#\" are comment lines and thus ignored.\nLines  that  begin with \"!\" are deselected, causing the deactivation of\nthe CA certificate in question.\nFurthermore   all   certificates   found   below   /usr/local/share/ca-\ncertificates are also included as implicitly trusted.\nFrom the above, I would infer that the preferred way to get local certificate files into the trusted store is to put them into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates, and then run update-ca-certificates. You do not need to touch /etc/ssl/certs directly.\nNaming the certificates with .crt extensions seemed to be required as well.\n\nA: Sorry for the big delay. I figured out how to get it work, here is the solution:\nOn this page, all parameters for WLAN-Setup are listed. If I just connect to the WLAN and select in den Setup-Screen on the UbuntuPhone 'WPA2 Enterprise / AES' as encryption,  then all the other parameters can be set. Even the certificate can be selected by the GUI.\n\nA: I just ran into the same issue. On my phone, I couldn't choose the certificate. It gave me the browser and the filemanager as options but, whatever I chose,  I could not successfully add the certificate.\nWhat worked for me, though, was getting the python script they make for Uni Siegen for Linux and executing it in the terminal.  \nIn my case, it was over ssh because I like autocomplete but on the phone's Terminal, it will propably work as well.\n", "Q: Can autopilot use an existing Ceph cluster? If I already have an existing Ceph cluster, can Autopilot build an OpenStack cloud that makes use of it? Or does Autopilot want to set the whole thing up itself?\n\nA: Autopilot uses a reference architecture that co-locates compute (Nova) and storage (Ceph OSD) on the same nodes. As a result, consuming an external storage cluster is not necessary.\n", "Q: The desktop of ubuntu 15.04, doesn't work I try to instaló ubuntu many times un muy pc, but when i replay the desktop doesn't work. It looks like a normal ubuntu desktop, but when i try to clik on  ANY icon it doesn't work. Please help me, i'm hopeless.\n\nA: First logout of the system and press CTRL + ALT + F1 which will open a terminal, then type the following:\napt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\napt-get install unity\napt-get purge nvidia* bumblebee*\napt-get install nvidia-prime\nshutdown -r now\n\n", "Q: Virtualbox - how to passthrough modem from ubuntu host to windows guest It is possible to pass-through an usb modem which is not recognized by the host Ubuntu 15.04 to a windows guest?, I have the windows drivers and I want to use dial-up while keeping my Ubuntu host. How can I do that?, any other Virtualization software will allow me to do the trick?\n\nA: To pass trough an USB device from host to guest in Virtual Box we need the following prerequisites (also see this question & answer):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Oracle Extension Pack for USB 2.0 support.\n\n*Become a member of the group vboxusers.\n\n*Activate USB support in the Virtual Box Manager.\n\n*Select the host-device to be captured by the guest.\n\n\nSometimes an USB device may be recognized by the host but can not be captured with steps above. For these devices we may have more luck to set up an USB device filter. There may still be devices that can not be added. These devices may then not be supported, and unfortunately can't be used.\nAn USB device filter can be added with the Virtual Box Manager on selecting + in the USB device filter section (also see link above). Any device matching an entry in these filter settings will then be captured by the virtual machine on start-up.\nTo list possible entries for a filter we may also issue:\nVBoxManage list usbhost\n\nThis command will list all available and recognized USB devices. \nAs a minimum a vendorID and the productID is recommended for an USB filter. These can also be listed and read with\nlsusb -v\n\nIn rare cases a virtual machine will not be able to boot after we had attached a device by a filter. Then we can not use this device in a virtual machine.\n", "Q: Is it possible to move the LAMP server to another drive on the same computer? I want to move the /var/www/ folder to a different partition drive and start the server from there, how can I do that?\n\nA: You will need to edit the configuration for apache. The default configuration is stored in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default.\nEdit this file with (sudo -H gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default for example) and locate the line\nDocumentRoot /var/www\nand change the path to your new path. Afterwards, you can reload the apache configuration with\nsudo service apache2 reload\n\nIf you are serving over SSL you'll need to edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl as well.\n\nA: Move the content of /var/www to the new partition and mount this partition with an entry in fstab at /var/www.\nOn Ask Ubuntu there are many answers for the correct entry in the fstab.\n", "Q: How to allow apache to access another directory ouside /html/www/ At the moment I have a apache web server and in this web server I have a \"test.html\" file. this file streams an audio file from the following directory.  \"audio/monkey.mp3\". (full path /var/www/html/work/audio/monkey.mp3) this works fine at the moment.\nideally I would like to access another audio file in another directory, which is outside the webserver directory. for exmaple /var/spool/music/.\ni tried pointing the \"test.html\" file to there but it didnt work. anything out side /var/www/html/ will not work. \n\nA: Apache is limited to serving files within its document root. You could change the document root (probably not the best idea in this case). You could also create a symbolic link to the directory:\nln -s /var/spool/music /var/www/music\n\nYou will also need to make sure that apache has +r privileges for the files in question and +x for the directory. One way to ensure that is to change the group of the files/folder in question to www-data.\n\nA: I will give this a go. Is there any security risks if I use a symbolic link? the end goal is to let users be able to stream music on a web gui.  \nshanika\n", "Q: Hotkey for switching between windows I've the three open windows: \n\nI would like to switch between them as Alt+1 - first windows, Alt+2 - second window, Alt+3 - third windows and so on.\nIs there any third-party tool or other ways to do it?\n\nA: I don't know if lubuntu keymapings are the same with ubuntu but the way to do it is hold down the Super/Windows Menu key and the keyboard shortcuts list will pop out. In ubuntu you can do it with Super+ 1-9.\n\nA: I ended up with small script  WindowsSwitcher\nNow to navigate to the necessary windows it's enough to click Windows+1, Windows+2 and so on.\nCtrl+Tab is not convenient when you have more than two windows and switch pretty often between them during the coding. \nUnfortuantely I didn't find in GUI of Lubuntu how to set it.\n\nA: If you mean change tabs , as far as i know in firefox is :\nForward-\nCTRL+TAB \n\nBackward-\nCTRL+SHIFT+TAB\n\nMore here:\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly\n", "Q: How to use internet through VPN in Ubuntu 14.04? I have DSL connection. I need to know how to setup and use openVPN.\n\nA: *\n\n*You need to install the openvpn and openvpn network manager plugin packages:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install openvpn\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn \n\n\n*Setup your openvpn session:\n2.1 - In your network connections go to VPN - set up VPN, then choose add connection type VPN - OpenVPN, click on Create or import a saved ovpn configuration.\n\n\n2.2 - In the editing of your VPN connection window you configure in general IP address or host name of your VPN provider\n \n2.3 - choose the required certificates and keys / user name and password. \n2.4 - In the special you set up VPN connection details such as port, LZO compression, TCP, UDP, TAP device - these are settings from your VPN provider. \n2.5 - Set up the security tab according to your VPN provider. Finally click on save to save the new VPN settings. \n\n*To try the new VPN go again to your network connections - VPN and click on the newly created VPN.\n\n\nPlease note that even if you get a successful connection message and do not get any traffic through, then your settings are incorrect.\nGood guide is on this site. Please note that there is also server and client setup as well. As a server you might want to run a device which runs 24/7, such as router or nas.\nYou can see this video how to setup in Ubuntu 14.04 in unity desktop.\nThe screenshoots have been taken from this site.\nFor ovpn configuration you may use the public VPN service here\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 kernel 3.19+ Intel Wireless AC-7260 I'm using the ubuntu 15.04 (kernel 3.19+) but the driver that I'm using it's not working well.\nComparing it with widowns I'm losing ~50% of signal.\nI'm comming from linux mint that also wasn't able to use the correct driver or configuration.\nI already tried change kernel version and install the drivers in this list:\nhttps://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi#Firmware\nThe last one that I tried was:\n3.19+   iwlwifi-7260-ucode-25.17.12.0.tgz\nAny suggestions of how to fix it it's very wellcome\nthanks\n\nA: There is no other driver than the one provided by Intel for this wireless card.\nHowever sometimes connection issues can be resolved by:\n\n\n*\n\n*unplugging your computer from the power line (just power off will not be sufficient) to reset the device.\n\n*unplugging the antennas cables from the card, and re-plugging in a changed order\n\n\n\n", "Q: Error editing connection Unable to find a connection with UUID ('null') When I open System Settings > Network > Wired and click options, it responds with the 'Error' How do I fix this? \n\nA: Search Ubuntu: Enter \"Network connection\" -> Add > Ethernet -> set Automantic(DHCP) at Ipv4 and tick \"require ipv4 addressing for...\" -> Save. \n\nA: It seems like MAC address of interface is not configured or changed:\nopen /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/eth0 (if your interface eth1 then open that)\nand verify MAC address is correctly added or if not added then add like :\nmac-address=DC:A9:71:59:9F:AC\n\nyour correct MAC address solve your problem. if not then you can generate UUID for interface.\nuuidgen eth0\nffc3c3a4-6c82-457b-8f58-7d99db1813c1\n\nand add manually /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/eth0\nuuid=ffc3c3a4-6c82-457b-8f58-7d99db1813c1\n\n", "Q: After 15.10 upgrade NetworkManager using 30% CPU Just upgraded a 3rd Gen Lenovo Carbon X1 from 15.04 to 15.10 and I noticed a rise in CPU usage. \n/usr/sbin/NetworkManager is using ~35% constantly and /lib/systemd/systemd-journald seems to rise when NetworkManager is started (drops when it is stopped).\nTurning of the wireless adapter does nothing. Turning off bluetooth also does nothing. No LAN is connected.\nStopping the service fixes the problem, obviously, but this is not a viable option.\n\nA: Turns out I had a custom config file\n\n/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/local\n\nwith one line\n\ncache-size=300\n\nWhen I removed this file (experimenting), network manager instantly stopped using CPU and returned to normal. The problem seems to be fixed.\n\nA: My issue was that NetworkManager.service tried to start dnsmasq on 127.0.1.1:53, but that port was already taken by dnsmasq.service. The solution for me was sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq.service\n\nA: I had the similar problem. Another symptom was if I suspended the system, then the DNS failed to work after being awaken from suspend. What helped me was to comment out dnsmasq in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. \n#dns=dnsmasq\n\n", "Q: How do I test unity 8 in 15.10?

When I try to mount under Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 in Nautilus, it gives me this error message:\nError mounting /dev/dm-1 at /media/adrian/16GB_Luks1: Command-line `mount -t \"ext4\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid\" \"/dev/dm-1\" \"/media/adrian/16GB_Luks1\"' exited with non-zero exit status 32: mount: block device /dev/mapper/luks-5572986f-9288-4c03-973d-af8c6454ea3b is write-protected, mounting read-only\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mapper/luks-5572986f-9288-4c03-973d-af8c6454ea3b,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\nI was literally just planning to backup the disk, so help would really be appreciated! :(\n\nA: Looks like the problem is the SD card is somehow locked to read-only. Maybe the \"read-only\" switch (write protect switch) is on, maybe the card reader is dirty and the \"ro\" switch is stuck, maybe the card itself is failing (I've read that sometimes cards & USB drives fail that way).\nI have a card where the little switch broke & fell off completely. It was always read-only, and I had to put a little piece of tape over where the switch used to be, then it was read-write (rw) and still works ok.\nIf it happens again, double-check the card's swtich, and definitely look in the syslog &/or dmesg | tail\nThis page (Hack: Why Is My SD Card Write Protected?) has more info on the write protect switch, how it works and how to \"hack\" it to always writeable.\n\nAnd for the future, definitely keep a copy of the LUKS header, just in case there's some problem reading the drive/card in the future. At least you'll be able to decrypt whatever is left readable if the header is ever damaged. A full backup of the data on the card is an especially good idea now too, in case it is failing.\n", "Q: Connect to server through intermedieate computer I have accounts on 2 other machines machine 1: 172.16.68.1 and machine 2: 172.16.68.3 i use ssh to  login to machine 1.\nI am unable to directly ssh to machine to but once i have logged in in machine 1, i am able to login using ssh to machine 2.\nIs there a way i can directly ssh to machine 2?\nOr at least i need a way to use the connect to server option to login to machine 2, because the login to machine 1 then login to machine 2 works via the terminal, but it won't work via the connect to server option.\nI need a gui way to browse machine 2, open files via sublime in my current machine etc.\nAny suggestions?\nEDIT :\nI tried the solution given in How do I SSH to machine A via B in one command?\nIt works for me in the terminal, but the gui connect to server fails saying\nUnhandled error message: Timed out when logging in\nEDIT 2:\n\nNotice the Connect to server in the left panel, that's what i am talking about.\n\nA: How about this one?\nssh 172.16.68.3 -l your_username_on_machine_2\n\nMake sure the ssh service is started during system start, not after login:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring\nFor a GUI way to login to a second computer enable desktop sharing on the required machine and use remmina to connect via remote desktop.\nBe sure you enable the required ports on firewall.\n", "Q: Azure Ubuntu cli sudo waagent -deprovision gives error Azure documentation says that the command \"sudo waagent -deprovision\" must be given to prepare an Azure Ubuntu vm guest server to become an Azure base vm image (via the Azure vm guest GUI capture command).

I use xubuntu with apache2 and phpmyadmin.\nAlso I want that phpmyadmin is not visible in the network but only at the localhost!\n\nA: I assume this is for home? You'll need to check your router to make sure that port forwarding is properly configured. Also, your ISP may block incoming port 80 because many of them do not allow hosting a web server unless you have a business account. If that is the case then you might need to use a different external port and forward it to port 80 of your web server. \nAnd what do you mean by \"it doesn't work\"? What do you see?

But that's not the problem about. My problem is, that I don't get any Internet connection or a connection to my router. But on Windows everything is fine. On my ifconfig is one eth0 without any a dresses except the MAC adress. The other return I got is the lo, and it returns an inet adress of localhost (127.0.0.1). I really don't know what to do now :(\n\nWhat about my /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf? One line is: \nno-auto-default=FF:AA:14:91:DC:ED\n\nIs that right or wrong? For me it seems to be wrong because of no and default :'D\nThis is my /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf now:\n[main] \nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\nCOUNTRY=DE\n#dns=dnsmaq\n\n#no-auto-default=FC:AA:14:91:DC:ED,\n\n[ifupdown] \nmanaged=false\n\n[keyfile] \nhostname=Max-PC\n\n\nA: Try editing your /etc/network/interfaces file and make sure it has auto eth0 or something similar like this:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet loopback\n\niface eth0 inet\n       managed true\n       dns-nameservers 8.8.4.4\n\nChange the nameserver accordingly if you don't want to use google-dns. 8.8.4.4 is just an example that should work fine if used.\nThen, restart network-manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nEDIT\nFirst of all, the wait time for waiting for networking resources may seem like it takes forever but is only set to 60 or 90 seconds by default. Just be patient and run the following command when the system finally does boot to prevent this in the future:\nsudo sed -e 's/sleep.../sleep 1/g' /etc/init/failsafe.conf\n\nAdditionally, you should probably post the entire contents of your /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file. You may omit the hostname line if you feel you need to for privacy reasons. or just change the line to hostname=hostname and we'll get the drift.\nAs far as the line: no-auto-default=FF:AA:14:91:DC:ED is concerned, I don't see a similar line in my file so it's probably best to comment that line out.\nHere's an example of what a functioning file looks like:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\nCOUNTRY=US\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\n[keyfile]\nhostname=$HOSTNAME\n\nReplace $HOSTNAME with your actual hostname. To print your hostname, run the following command:\necho $HOSTNAME\n\nAlso, replace COUNTRY=US with your actual country code or comment this line out. \nAdditionally, make sure ports 67 and 68 are open for DHCP and also make sure port 53 is open for DNS. Additionally without being said, you need ports 80 and 443 open for http and https.\nHowever, these ports should not be blocked by default so unless you messed around with your firewall settings, you shouldn't have to adjust these settings.

I'm experiencing the following problems with sound:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sound settings have disappeared from the system settings dialog and so has the sound status from the menu bar, I can still adjust the volume using the Fn key\n\n*Whenever the computer wakes up from suspend mode the sound plays through both the analog jack and the internal speakers\n\n*The sound cuts off periodically and I get the following error on VLC: \n\n\nAudio output failed:\n  The audio device \"sysdefault:CARD=PCH\" could not be used:\n  Device or resource busy.\n\nSo is there a way to revert to the original ubuntu sound settings without reinstalling the OS altogether?\nUPDATE\n\n\n*\n\n*Status icon fixed with: sudo apt-get install --reinstall indicator-sound-gtk2 but sound settings still missing\n\n\nA: All references to Applications in this answer refer to the applications menu item in the control panel.\n\nXfce - Audio Mixer\n(See note below)\nAs Xubuntu uses Xfce desktop environment you could install Audio Mixer, xfce4-mixer, if it has been removed (optionally with --reinstall).\n$ sudo apt-get install xfce4-mixer\n\nand use the Audio Mixer found under\n\n*\n\n*Applications -> Multimedia -> Audio Mixer\nor:\n$ xfce4-mixer\n\nthen tweak around.\nControl panel\nTo add it to your control panel go to settings manager:\n\n*\n\n*Applications -> Settings -> Settings Manager\n\n*\n\n*Select Panels\nor:\n\n*\n\n*Applications -> Settings -> Panels\nor:\n$ xfce4-panel -p\n\nThen select the Items tab and add (the [+] button) where you select Audio Mixer.\nThis is a very minimal audio controller. (Volume up/down - what else does one need?). To configure simply right-click the control-icon and select Properties, or select Run Audio Mixer if need be.\nPA - pavucontrol\nIf you run Pulse Audio (Wikipedia) you could also use the PulseAudio Volume Control. Should be under Multimedia if installed, or start it from command line by:\n$ pavucontrol\n\nIf not installed the package has the same name.\n$ sudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\nThis is the one I mainly use to adjust sound settings by GUI. (When not using JACK)\nNote: Audio Mixer\nAs per Xfce 4.12 release notes:\n\n“Due to gstreamer1.0 having dropped the mixer-interface entirely, and xfce4-mixer and xfce4-volumed relying on this interface with gstreamer0.10, our mixer application and volume daemon cannot be ported to 1.0 and are consequently not maintained anymore.”\n\nAs such I guess it would be best to rely on other controls such as pavucontrol in the future unless Xfce comes along with a new one.\nBut, it should work, and works fine here. I have both gstreamer 0.10  and 1.\nOnly to note that it could disappear in future releases.\n\nSub note:\nAfter last update the audio settings was all re-configured as well as several others - such as keyboard tuning (I have for example a much lower repeat delaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay then default etc.)\nAudio card was switched to HDMI (on monitor) instead of internal. Disabled audio such as input microphone was switched on etc.\nPassed by here as I wondered if anyone else had similar issues.\n", "Q: Can't install the boot loader I decide to install Ubuntu 15.10 (64 bit) on an old laptop running Ubuntu (32 bit).\nI download the ( 64 bit ) image to my hard disk and decide to decide to create a bootable USB. \nI run the startup disc creator and  after a while I get a message\n\"Can't install the boot loader\". Nothing else and no suggestions as to what I should do.\nI Google around and discover that I (probably?) should format my USB as FAT32\nand try again.\nI select the USB and Format -- no FAT32 option is available.\nI decide to go for EXT4 (suitable for all LINUX systems it says!!!!). The format routine fails some python routine some where can't find some oblock somewhere else.\nI borrow my wife's WINDOWS computer and format the USB. No problems!\nI put the USB back into my Linux computer and format(yet again) in EXT4. All seems well.\nOnce again I try the start up disc creator and once again I get the message\n\"Can't create the boot loader\".\n\nA: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WilyWerewolf/ReleaseNotes\nDue to changes in syslinux, it is not currently possible to use usb-creator from 14.04 and earlier releases to write USB images for 15.04 or later; we believe that it is also not possible to use usb-creator from a 15.04 or later system to write USB images for earlier releases. For now the workaround is to use a matching release of Ubuntu to write the images, but we intend to issue updates soon to work around this incompatibility.  \nAt launchpad they are known as bug 1325801, bug 1446646 and bug 1499746.\n\nA: Ok, first of all for thumb drives you want FAT32. It's the default choice in any windows formatter so don't be reluctant to format it from windows.\nSecond, if you are using an old laptop you'll want to run the 32-bit version of Ubuntu and not the 64-bit version. The 64-bit version is for multi-core processors.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Mac El Captain along with Ubuntu 14.04 Due to lots of old stuff in the archive, I am little bit confused. How do I install Ubuntu 14.04 to my IMac with MacOS El Captain. Is it necessary to use Refit? What about direct installing from an Ubuntu Live USB drive? \n\nA: rEFIt has been abandoned since 2010. I created a fork of it, called rEFInd, which I'm actively maintaining. It's not strictly necessary to use either program, but one or the other (and especially rEFInd) can be helpful.\nThe main \"gotcha\" with OS X 10.11 (\"El Capitan\"), compared to earlier OS X releases, is the new System Integrity Protection (SIP) feature, aka \"rootless.\" This is a security feature that's supposed to make it harder for inexperienced users to cause their systems to self-destruct, or for malware to take control of the computer. This has the undesirable side effect of making it harder to install and use some types of low-level software, including third-party boot managers like rEFIt and rEFInd. In brief, you must disable SIP. Doing this is described on quite a few pages, such as this one and this one. After you install rEFInd, you can re-enable SIP.\nThere are about a bazillion sites that describe how to install Ubuntu on a Mac. Try to find one that's relatively recent. Also, be aware that it's possible to install Ubuntu in either BIOS/CSM/legacy mode or in EFI mode. The latter is almost always preferable, but a lot of guides (especially older ones) describe the former -- often without properly describing the difference. See this page of mine for basic information on what the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) is and why it's problematic. (That page is geared more towards UEFI-based PCs than Macs, but it's still pretty applicable.)\nIn broad strokes, I recommend you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu installer into \"try without installing mode.\"\n\n*Open a Terminal program window.\n\n*In the Terminal, type ubiquity -b. This will run the Ubuntu installer, but -b tells it to not install a boot loader. If you follow advanced installation options, be sure to use ext4fs as your filesystem. Do not use a separate /boot partition unless you use LVM, RAID, or an encrypted root (/) partition. You may need to shrink your OS X partition to make room for Ubuntu (or you can do that before you start).\n\n*When you're done, reboot, but hold down Command+R to boot into the OS X recovery environment.\n\n*Launch a Terminal window and type csrutil disable to disable SIP.\n\n*Reboot. The system should boot OS X normally.\n\n*Install rEFInd.\n\n\nAt this point, when you reboot, rEFInd should appear and give you options to boot either OS X or Ubuntu. Chances are both will work; but if you used a separate /boot partition, you'll have to hit F2 or Insert twice rather than Enter to boot Ubuntu. In the resulting screen, you must add ro root={whatever} to tell the kernel where your root (/) filesystem is; {whatever} is a description of that location, as in /dev/sda7 or /dev/mapper/ubuntu-root. After you boot, running the mkrlconf.sh script that comes with rEFInd should obviate the need for adding the root= option.\n", "Q: Can't SSH to VirtualBox Ubuntu server from public IP I'm running Ubuntu 15.04 (latest version) on a virtual machine from my Windows machine and trying to set this up so I can access it from outside of my local network. I've been at this for a few hours and haven't had any success. \nI've got openssh installed, there are 2 adapters connected(one being NAT and the other a bridge adapter). I can connect just fine with the VM's local IP address and that's about it, whenever I try to connect to it from the public IP, it just times out. I do believe I port forwarded correctly, but I'm not 100% sure. \nAny tips or help is really appreciated.\n\nA: This is probably due to the fact that residential ISPs generally block ports such as 22, etc. You'll need to either use a different port, or ask your ISP if they can unblock the port.\n", "Q: Network scanner (Canon) stops after upgrade from 15.04 to 15.10 I have just upgraded Kubuntu 15.04 to 15.10 - all very nice. The machine is working well, and I can print to the Canon pixma mx420 with no problems as before, but both Skanlite and xsane return errors. xsane returns:\nFailed to open device 'pixma:MX420_192.168.1.5': Invalid argument.\n\nAlso: \nscanimage -L\ndevice `pixma:MX420_192.168.1.5' is a CANON Canon PIXMA MX420 multi-function peripheral\n\nSo the system is finding the scanner at the correct network address, but I don't know how to debug further. Note this all worked well before upgrade on this machine and the scanner has been tested from another laptop on the same network successfully - which is still on Kubuntu 15.04.\nThanks.\n\nA: It's a bug in a few versions of sane-backends (pkg libsane) which affects versions 0.17.10 - 0.17.18 (the last one actually present in 15.10). Since the bug has been fixed since July 2015 we just need it packaged in a debian/ubuntu repo. Until then there are several possible workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a version of libsane, libsane-common and libphoto2-pack10 from vivid and downgrade. Vivid contains 0.17.4 and thus is not affected.\n\n*Get a version of libsane, libsane-common and libjpeg62-turbo from debian experimental. I found the version 0.17.23 in it and it seems to work for me. But be carefull, its experimental :-).\n\n*Build the sane-backends libraries by youself. Not a straightway method, you better get the debian packaging patch to get it into proper paths.\n\n*Use ScanGearMP which apparently works anyway. Is suitable for simple scanning for example through GIMP.\n\n\nA: I had the similar problem with the Canon Pixma MG5450 (MG5400 series) using Ubuntu 15.10.\nProblem:\nUsing \"Simple Scan\" to scan a document failed with:\n\nFailed to scan\n  Unable to connect to scanner\n\nBut the device was properly discovered using scanimage -L\n\n$ scanimage -L\n$ device `pixma:MG5400_C5BFDC000000' is a CANON Canon PIXMA MG5400 Series multi-function peripheral\n\nSolution:\nDownload 3 packages from Debian Expirimental - Libs\n\n\n*\n\n*libjpeg62-turbo\n\n\n*\n\n*Version: 1:1.4.80-115-gfb907b2-1\n\n\n*libsane-common\n\n\n*\n\n*Version: 1.0.26~git20151121-1\n\n\n*libsane\n\n\n*\n\n*Version: 1.0.26~git20151121-1\n\n\n\n(My reputation won't allow me to add more then 2 links.

Please OK, so I originally downloaded Ubuntu from the Ubuntu.com website, just about one month ago, and how I got it, I damn sure dont know, but I got 12.0, and have had nothing but problems since. Not knowing anything about Ubuntu other than its an operating system, and I need one. I was using windows 7 unreg. copy, so I elected to just wipe it out and out only ubuntu on my hard drive, looking back now, I wish I could have figured out how to put both on the hard drive, I would have. But, anyway, heres my question.....If I wanted to and I do, start over, my goal is to just have a operating system that works and works well without to much B.S., Im not a computer nerd, and not looking at becoming one anytime soon, So what is the best And Easiest way to get rid of 12.0 and get whatever version of Ubuntu that is best for me and easiest to do, Please help, my computer is pretty much useless now, so a solution to this problem would like make my day.  Thank You\n\nA: I don't know if you want 32 or 64 bit but, as you had Windows 7 installed, I'm going to guess that you have a 64 bit CPU. If you don't then download the 32 bit version.\nAnyhow, it is my experience that the most universally working versions of the Ubuntu family is those in the LTS (Long Term Stable) builds. Those are supported for a long time and you needn't worry much about the OS - you just use it. It works out well. On the other hand, you don't have to 'just use it' but you can actually make it do what you want it to do.\nAs you're coming from the Windows family and want simplicity, I'm going to go ahead and recommend Lubuntu. The LXDE is light, familiar, and easy to work with. The WM (Window Manager - not to be mistaken for \"Windows\" the OS) is also easy enough - no real needs to configure. It just works for the most part.\nHaving said that, I'd suggest Lubuntu which you can download here. You'll want the Standard PC version and probably the 64 bit version. (64 bit means you can throw longer instruction sets at the CPU but that's immaterial at this point. Your CPU probably supports it if it's from within the last 10 years or so.)\nAnyhow, head there and download the .ISO. You can burn the ISO to disk (as an image, not a direct copy) or you can use a tool like unetbootin to 'burn' it to a Live USB (format the USB with FAT32). Either way works. Boot to the Live disk environment and then see if it works for you. If it does, follow the installation instructions - just click the icon and go through it, it's pretty simple.\nIf you need help installing then ask a new , specific, question or use the online resources. \n\nA: You do not have to be a computer nerd to understand and use the system successfully and nobody expects you to, but it would surely help you, if you would accept that an operating system change might take a little learning and not blame and curse the system for everything that does not work right away. Especially considering that you probably want help and not only tell us how much you think the system sucks.\nHaving said that, I know how much issues can be frustrating, so why don't you start by editing your question and specifying exactly what you had problems with? Is it graphics, sound, games, programs, media playback, network? So far I know nothing about your issues with the system, just that there apparently were problems.\nGenerally, Ubuntu 12.04 (I guess that is the version you're referring to, since there is no 12.0) is a rather stable release, at least I have had the least trouble with it.\nIt also depends on the hardware that is used, maybe you care to share that as well?\n", "Q: Cannot switch to Nvidia card from VGA, I get 'Error: BrokenCount > 0', can't update the libvdpau1 file Ok, this is a weird one.\nUsing a HP Pavillion Slimline using Nvidia GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 with the driver 304.128 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nResults from running \nlshw\n\nShow the following (not sure if all/any of this is relevant):\ndescription: Desktop Computer\nproduct: s5602la (BM437AA#ABM)\nvendor: Hewlett-Packard\nversion: Chassis Version\nwidth: 64 bits\ncapabilities: smbios-2.5 dmi-2.5 vsyscall32\nconfiguration: boot=normal chassis=desktop family=103C_53316J G=D     sku=BM437AA#ABM uuid=8088F359-CB59-1610-A395-8546BA7CF8F9\n  *-core\n   description: Motherboard\n   product: 2A99\n   vendor: PEGATRON CORPORATION\n   physical id: 0\n   version: 6.01\n   serial: 107396950000153\n *-firmware\n      description: BIOS\n      vendor: American Megatrends Inc.\n      physical id: 0\n      version: 6.13\n      date: 09/08/2010\n      size: 64KiB\n      capacity: 960KiB\n      capabilities: isa pci pnp apm upgrade shadowing escd cdboot bootselect socketedrom edd int13floppy1200 int13floppy720 int13floppy2880 int5printscreen int9keyboard int14serial int17printer int10video acpi usb ls120boot zipboot biosbootspecification\n\n…\n\n *-pci:0\n      description: PCI bridge\n      product: MCP61 PCI bridge\n      vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n      physical id: 100\n      bus info: pci@0000:00:04.0\n      version: a1\n      width: 32 bits\n      clock: 66MHz\n      capabilities: pci ht subtractive_decode bus_master cap_list\n *-multimedia\n      description: Audio device\n      product: MCP61 High Definition Audio\n      vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n      physical id: 5\n      bus info: pci@0000:00:05.0\n      version: a2\n      width: 32 bits\n      clock: 66MHz\n      capabilities: pm msi ht bus_master cap_list\n      configuration: driver=snd_hda_intel latency=0 maxlatency=5 mingnt=2\n      resources: irq:22 memory:fbff8000-fbffbfff\n…\n\n *-pci:1\n      description: PCI bridge\n      product: MCP61 PCI Express bridge\n      vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n      physical id: 9\n      bus info: pci@0000:00:09.0\n      version: a2\n      width: 32 bits\n      clock: 33MHz\n      capabilities: pci pm msi ht pciexpress normal_decode bus_master cap_list\n      configuration: driver=pcieport\n      resources: irq:40\n *-pci:2\n      description: PCI bridge\n      product: MCP61 PCI Express bridge\n      vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n      physical id: b\n      bus info: pci@0000:00:0b.0\n      version: a2\n      width: 32 bits\n      clock: 33MHz\n      capabilities: pci pm msi ht pciexpress normal_decode bus_master cap_list\n      configuration: driver=pcieport\n      resources: irq:41\n *-pci:3\n      description: PCI bridge\n      product: MCP61 PCI Express bridge\n      vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n      physical id: c\n      bus info: pci@0000:00:0c.0\n      version: a2\n      width: 32 bits\n      clock: 33MHz\n      capabilities: pci pm msi ht pciexpress normal_decode bus_master cap_list\n      configuration: driver=pcieport\n      resources: irq:42\n *-display\n      description: VGA compatible controller\n      product: C61 [GeForce 6150SE nForce 430]\n      vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n      physical id: d\n      bus info: pci@0000:00:0d.0\n      version: a2\n      width: 64 bits\n      clock: 66MHz\n      capabilities: pm msi vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n      configuration: driver=nvidia latency=0\n      resources: irq:21 memory:fa000000-faffffff memory:e0000000-efffffff memory:f9000000-f9ffffff memory:fbfc0000-fbfdffff\n\nI wanted to play League of Legends, so I successfully installed PlayOnLinux and LoL itself.

I also tried to encrypt using the Evolution email client, but that doesn't work either. I can still encrypt things from command line, but the password prompt looks different than it did in 15.04, so I'm guessing the problem that 15.10 uses a different version of gpg, and it isn't compatible with enigmail for some reason.\nSo could someone help me get Thunderbird or Evolution to encrypt and sign my E-mails in Ubuntu 15.10?\n\nA: I had the same problem. It had to do with \"pinentry\" not being installed, which means you were not getting prompted to enter your pgp key passphrase.\nThere are various versions. \npinentry-tty 0.9.5-4\n  pinentry-qt4 0.9.5-4\n  pinentry-gtk2 0.9.5-4\n  pinentry-curses 0.9.5-4\n  pinentry-gnome3 0.9.5-4\nI installed\nsudo apt-get install pinentry-gtk2\n\nThen RESTART your session, and it should work.\n[EDIT]\nYou might also need to install gpg2\nsudo apt-get install gnup2g\n\nThen in thunderbird -> Enigmail -> Preferences. Make sure that it detects:\nGnuPGP was found in /usr/bin/gpg2\nOtherwise override with /usr/bin/gpg2\n\nA: As someone said installing gnupg2g will get it working. \nBut after installing it, I needed to run a gpg2 -version to get it to write a config file in /home directory for it to work.\nHowever the current version of pinentry does not support pasting a password from a password manager, so you really need to know the password or your in trouble.\nOne work around I found with Keepass2, is to set it to autotype with the window labelled as pinentry, and the the parameters set to \n{PASSWORD}{ENTER}\n\nIt is a little fiddly, as the pinentry enter screen is on top of the screen and cannot be moved or minimised. \nThis seems to be a \"Feature\" of gpg2, and I cannot seem to find a better solution.\nI doubt I will remember a 64 character gpg key :-) so stuck with this until I figure something better out\n", "Q: Making a bash script to build and run a C++ program I'm trying to make a bash script to build and run a C++ program at once with one command, normally right now I have to do\ng++ file.cc -o file\n./file < input.in\n\nI want to be able to do, say\nbrun file.cc < input.in\n\nHow can I do this? Right now I have something that can be run like\nbrun file.cc '< input.in'\n\nHere's my current script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nCFILE=$1\nOBJFILE=\"${CFILE%.*}\"\n\ng++ $CFILE -o $OBJFILE\necho  \"Built file: $CFILE -> $OBJFILE\"\nchmod +x $OBJFILE\n\nARGS=\"${@##*.cc}\"\n./$OBJFILE\"\"$ARGS\n\nWhich gets stuck at the last line, it just doesn't do anything then. Can anyone help me out here?\n\nA: This should be sufficient:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nCFILE=$1\nOBJFILE=\"${CFILE%.*}\"\n\ng++ $CFILE -o $OBJFILE\necho  \"Built file: $CFILE -> $OBJFILE\"\n\n./$OBJFILE\n\nAnd you should be able to call it thus:\nbrun file.cc < input.in\n\nThis works because the input redirected to STDIN of the brun script is simply buffered, and that buffered input is then available to whichever sub-process reads it first - in this case your newly-built executable.\n\nYou might also consider using make to automate your build.  make is smart enough to do your build from default rules without the need for an explicit makefile.  So your build/run script could be as simple as:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nOBJFILE=\"${1%.*}\"\nmake \"$OBJFILE\" && ./$OBJFILE\n\nThe && here ensures that OBJFILE is only run if there were no build errors found by make.\n", "Q: Executables not Working like Regular When I type this command\nnohup CloudCompute.command &\nit produces the result\n[1] 782\nwhich is what I want.

It just prints what CloudCompute.command outputs, not the actual PID which shows when you run it. I am sure it is in the same directory.\nWhy is this happening? What can I do to get the executable to produce the same output as manually typing it?\nThanks\n\nA: \nWhy is this happening? \n\nThat output:\n[1] 782\n\nis not from the executable. That what bash writes to the terminal, when you execute someting in the backgroud. It's the job number [1] and the PID 782 of the process. Later when the process finished you will see something like:\n[1]+  Done                    command\n\nThis is also from bash noticing that the process with job number 1 has finished.\nWhen running a command in the background, the PID is stored in the variable $!:\n$ sleep 10 &\n[1] 1234\n$ echo $!\n1234\n\n\n\nWhat can I do to get the executable to produce the same output as manually typing it?\n\nTherefore, your executable is producing the same output.\n", "Q: How to setup bind9 as simple name resolver?

So I just want to setup the nameserver of every host to lets say ``192.168.178.10` and that should be everything I need.\nHow can I setup bind9 doing this?\nWhy?\nMy Fritz!Box is just not resolving most of the hostnames in my network. And I'm pretty sick of it - I tried troubleshooting it but the web interface is not very helpfull. It's not possible to telnet into it anymore because of firmware restrictions.\n\nA: Setting up bind9 is The Hard Way. Ubuntu (you are running Ubuntu, right?) comes with dnsmasq, a simple DNS server that respects /etc/hosts. Read man dnsmasq, then you can distribute 192.168.178.10 (DNS server address) manually or via DHCP .\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu 15.10 missing some files?

The same this is happening here in Unity after running a system update and then rebooting.

Only when I add the xorg-edgers ppa to my repositories and then executing a system update as notified does this problem occur. I used the same ppa in Ubuntu Gnome which generated the same problem. This time in Unity I didn't even install anything form the repository so I don't know why this happens. I could be making assumptions based on the correlation I see between adding the ppa, running updates, and then rebooting with a black screen before login.\nQUESTION: \nHow do I get access to the terminal to start trouble shooting the black screen nonsense if I can't get a login screen? Lately my beset solution is to clone the drive before this nonsense happens and image it back if it does break.\n\nA: In the Grub menu press the button in the bottom, which brings kernel launch options and add \"nomodeset\" there (dont remember what button it was). \nThen it will most probably boot you into a desktop. \nThen if your laptop is an optimus one use the following instructions in this answer:\nNvidia Driver and Heating Problem\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a text-only virtual console by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F3.\n\n*At the login: prompt type your username and press Enter.\n\n*At the Password: prompt type your user password and press Enter.\n\n*Now you are logged in to a text-only virtual console, and you can run terminal commands from the console. To reboot the system from the console run the command: sudo shutdown -r now. Press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F7 to exit from the virtual console. In Ubuntu 17.10 and later press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F2 to exit from the virtual console.\n\n*Sometimes if you just run the command: sudo reboot from the console, your computer will boot to your normal login screen when it reboots. This does not work every time or in all situations, but you may want to try it once anyway. Also this way of getting to your normal login screen is a workaround that does not fix anything, so you will still need to do something else to fix the black screen problem.  \nThere are some models of Nvidia graphics cards for which the proprietary graphics driver cannot be successfully installed except if the ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa is added to the software sources. ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa is also known to cause many boot failure problems, and I have read a lot of bad advice recommending adding ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa to the software sources in situations in which it is not appropriate. \n", "Q: Trouble installing Ubuntu 15.04 on a virtual machine i am trying to install ubuntu 15.04 on virtualbox.

This of course is expected, as we do not install on bare metal. We can safely ignore this warning.\nAfter installing Ubuntu from the .ISO file we have to remove this virtual CD-ROM from the virtual machine to be able to boot from the virtual hard drive (.VDI) we had created.

I am able to get to the consoles, tty1, tty2, and etc. I do have a video card; I think it is NVIDIA...\n\nA: Tried all the above and also tried upgrading (and downgrading) my nvidia drivers.\nIn the end what worked was to uninstall nvidia using\n\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia\n\nand remove nvidia files from /etc/modprobe.d/ - these were stopping nouveau from loading\nI also copied a backup of xorg.conf file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nthen rebooting worked.\n[edit] In fact this was not a complete solution since it only worked sometimes.  In the end I also needed to create a folder /var/lib/lightdm (see https://askubuntu.com/a/692627/451489) and also fix my .Xauthority permissions https://askubuntu.com/a/223634/451489) - now lightdm, X and unity all appear to be working reliably.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. I had to reinstall my desktop (kubuntu) which in turn reinstalled my display manager. One or both fixed the problem for me. \nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop \nJust replace kubuntu-desktop with your desktop of choice and then reboot. \n\nA: I followed a link to \"How to backup settings and list of installed packages\" thatwas very helpful. I also made a copy of /etc/passwd. I did that then found after the \"clean install\" I did not need to restore! The \"clean install\" left all my packages there (except TrueCrypt disappeared). When I reestablished my link to the home directory on the RAID array, The settings were generally restored. Working well now. Thank you.  I was expecting that the \"clean install\" would format the drive first before installing the OS, but I am pleasantly surprised to find that my expectation was incorrect!  I would rather be lucky than right.\n\nA: This answer https://askubuntu.com/a/692627/172035 solved it for me:\n\nIt is possible that the folder /var/lib/lightdm has not been created.\nYou could try: mkdir -p /var/lib/lightdm; chown -R lightdm:lightdm\n  /var/lib/lightdm ; chmod 0750 /var/lib/lightdm with root permission if\n  needed.\n\n\nA: For me, it turned out that this was caused by the upgrade process not completing properly. This command fixed the issue:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\nA: I got the same black screen after upgrade from 14.04 LTS to 15.10 . The reason I got the error was due to incomplete upgrades. \n\n\n*\n\n*To solve it, go to \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\", then go to previous installed kernel version, e.g. 3.10.58 (recovery mode).\n\n*Then choose \"normal boot\" to go to command line.

For me, I got the message sudo dpkg --configure -a incomplete\n\n*Running that command helped, and I am now using Ubuntu 15.10 happily.\n\n\nA: When I had this problem, the culprit was lightdm. \nWhen you are booting up and you get to the black screen,\n hit CTRL + ALT + F4. You should see a terminal pop up. \nThere you should type \nsudo apt-get purge lightdm\nthen\nsudo apt-get update \nnext\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\nfinally\ndpkg-reconfigure lightdm\nNow type sudo shutdown -r now to restart.\n\nA: had same problem, finaly after 2 hours of bruteforcing removing various user files restarting ..., came to solution\nwent to older kernel that helped to boot plasma\nthen opened drivers section and disabled nvidia driver (using X.Org X.server)\nrestarted to newest kernel and things now ok.\nhardware: GeForce GT 540M\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10beta, automatic update I have worked successful with Ubuntu 15.10 beta.

I am very interested in installing ZFS across all of them. I also am interested in using JuJu, MAAS, and Landscape to automate the installation of ZFS, and the management of each server. For instance I do not want to manually install ZFS on each machine. \nI have 4 questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can ZFS be used smoothly with Landscape, JuJu, and MAAS? \n\n*Is it possible to have Landscape manage the ZFS installation process?\n\n*Landscape supports two types of storage. One is iSCSI, and the other is Ceph storage. Can any of these be configured to install ZFS during the storage allocation phase?\n\n*How is raid/mirroring set up using JuJu, Landscape, and MAAS? \n\n*Can I setup ZFS mirroring from the Landscape console? .\nReferenced Programs/Utilities: (ZFS (Z File System), JuJu (Ubuntu Cloud), MAAS (Metal as a Service), and Landscape (See Page)). \n\nA: I'll do a first pass and the Community will improve this answer. Here we go:\n\n\n*\n\n*It depends on the meaning of smoothly and what you are trying to do exactly. Once the systems using ZFS are installed, Landscape and/or JuJu can manage them like any other Ubuntu system.\n\n*Landscape does not do bare metal deployment, it relies on MAAS to accomplish this task. The answer will be yes once MAAS can drive the 16.04 install process to select a ZFS option. Xenial needs to ship first, you can try the 16.04 betas to check this.\n\n*Landscape's Autopilot can build an OpenStack cloud with iSCSI or Ceph storage, but the backend details are hidden to make things simpler for the end user. You cannot select what filesystem type underlies these network storage options.\n\n*In the Landscape case, RAID is either not relevant (Ceph) or not used in the supplied configuration (iSCSI). In the MAAS case, setting up RAID underneath iSCSI should be possible but it is highly dependent on the system hardware.\n\n*No, you cannot configure ZFS mirroring from Landscape at present.

Looking to buy the BQ Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition but before I do so I need to ask a question\n(I'm not a develloper , I'm new at the game.)\nI'd like to use a VPN on my phone to chat and phonecall with no log and anonimity.\nI've a nordvpn souscription\nIs there a VPN software for the phone or an easy way to configure things?\n\nA: Update, as of OTA-10 that the BQ Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition now has, OpenVPN is natively part of the settings and the text below is obsolete\nWell, as of Ubuntu version OTA-9, that the BQ Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition now has, there is finally VPN. It should work with nordvpn as they have OpenVPN. It is not super-easy to configure though... ...here is what you will need to do:\nVPN is now supported on Ubuntu Touch via NetworkManager but there is no official GUI yet to configure it. Fortunatly Pete Woods has created a GUI we can use, download it from here: via the phone's browser app to the phone.\nInstall the GUI with this command from the phones terminal app:\npkcon install-local --allow-untrusted ~/Downloads/com.ubuntu.developer.pete-woods.vpn-editor_0.2.0_all.click\n\nThe new GUI app will now show up in the Apps Scope (refresh the app list by dragging the list down from the top)\nYou can now configure nordvpn by following the guide for Linux and NetworkManager, the GUI is not the same but resembles that of the linux desktop. Furthermore, there is no import ability of a configuration file. You may want to do the import of a configuration file on a linux desktop and then copy the settings to the phone.\nThere is one final step left. Most VPN services rely on a username and a password and at the moment there is no support to store the password for the VPN service on the phone automatically (even if the GUI app actually has a password field). \nTo my knowledge there is no other way to solve this than to edit the NetworkManager connection-configuration file for the new VPN connection manually and insert the password in plain text. It will be protected by root so it’s not as unsafe as one might think. To do this, get back to the terminal app. Go to the directory where the connection-configuration files are with the command: \ncd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections\n\nThen locate you connection, It’s probably called “VPN connection 1”. If there are many files you may need to inspect them to find your connection. Edit the file via e.g. \nsudo nano “VPN connection 1”\n\nInsert the following line last in the [vpn] section\npassword-flags=0\n\nThen, after this line, add a new section called [vpn-secrets] and a new line with the password line like this:\n[vpn-secrets]\npassword=your_vpn_password\n\nSave the file and you are ready.\nopen the VPN GUI app again and toggle the vpn connection to on and the VPN service should start.\nNote! once you inserted the credentials to the connection-configuration file you can not edit the connection in the GUI app anymore, if you do the password will be overwritten.\n", "Q: dnsmasq resolver on different port Im trying to use dnsmasq in conjunction with dnscrypt.

The problem is I get this error when I type in the terminal: ecryptfs-mount-private.\nI'm not sure this is related, but how do I set up my directory properly?\n\nA: I think you want these two eCryptFS tools (scripts really):\n\n\n*\n\n*ecryptfs-recover-private - find and mount any encrypted private directories\nUse this to mount your old encrypted home, and copy / back them up somewhere safe.\n\n*ecryptfs-migrate-home - migrate a user's home to directory to an encrypted home setup\nIt's man page contains this warning:\nWARNING: Make a complete backup copy of the  non-encrypted  data  to\nanother  system  or  external media. This script is dangerous and in\ncase of an error, could result in data lost, or lock USER out of the\nsystem!\n\nSo I'd definitely do the ecryptfs-recover-private and create backup copies first, if the data has any value.\nBUT you absolutely must have your old login passphrase in order to decrypt your old encrypted home (unless you already have a backup copy of the actual eCryptfs mount passphrase). From your statement I forgot my password you might be out of luck unless you can guess/remember your old password.\nRecovering your files from a backup copy would be much easier, if you have a backup copy (everyone really should have backup copies of important data, all drives fail eventually, and forgetting passphrases is easy to do).\nFYI, your actual encrypted files and wrapped-passphrase file should be stored in /home/.ecryptfs, along with every user's encrypted home. The actual home folder (for example /home/[username] only has links to the actual folders, and 2 help files.

The numbers are variable and \"!\" syntax is also exist several times in the text. For the first line there is always 8 spaces between \"!\" and \"lat\" but this is not the case for the second line. Is there any command available to allow me to extract next line after grep \"!        lat\" text \n\nA: You can use grep -A1 'expression'\nFrom the manual:\n-A num\n--after-context=num\n    Print num lines of trailing context after matching lines.\n\n\nIn your case:\ngrep -A1 \"!        lat\" foo | grep -v \"!        lat\"\n\nshould work to extract the second line only.\nNote:\nYou can use grep -P '^! {8}lat' instead of typing many . This is less error prone. The -P flag enables perl style regular expressions and {8} (There is a space before the '{') matches exactly 8 spaces.\n\nA: You can get the desired output in one go of grep using -z option to treat the lines of input file to be separated by NUL characters rather than newline charaters so that newline characters can be matched literally. You can do:\ngrep -Pzo '!\\s{8}lat[^\\n]*\\n\\K[^\\n]+' file.txt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-P will enable us to use PCRE, -o will get us the desired portion only \n\n*!\\s{8}lat[^\\n]*\\n will match the line with lat after ! and 8 spaces, also it will match the trailing newline character, the \\K will discard this match\n\n*[^\\n]+ will then match the next line i.e. what we want as output.\nHere i also assume that there is no space after lat, if there must be at least a space you can do:\ngrep -Pzo '!\\s{8}lat\\s+[^\\n]*\\n\\K[^\\n]+' file.txt\n\nExample:\n$ cat file.txt \n!        lat             long          elev (m)\n!      44.5199005      11.6468000       50.4276\n!      30.5199005      2445.6468000       23.89\n\n$ grep -Pzo '!\\s{8}lat[^\\n]*\\n\\K[^\\n]+' file.txt \n!      44.5199005      11.6468000       50.4276\n\n\nA: *\n\n*awk\nawk '/! {8}lat/ {a=1; next} a {a=0; print};' foo\n\n\n*sed\nsed -n '/! \\{8\\}lat/{n;p}' foo\n\n", "Q: Can't boot into Ubuntu after removing Windows partitions What has happened:\nI had installed Windows on my hdd abdicate Ubuntu 14 on the ssd.

I tried to reinstall it, but that didn't help. Any ideas?\n\nA: For the working fix, see the end of this answer.\nINITIAL ANSWER Oct 28th 2015 (outdated fix)\nTo avoid being asked if you want to use Chrome as the default browser, use the following workaround (proposed here and suggested in the comment section of this question by Yurii Kolesnykov):\nOpen the file ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Preferences with a text editor.\nFind the line\n\"check_default_browser\": true,\n\nand replace it with\n\"check_default_browser\": false,\n\nIn my case, the file was >200k characters, for which reason gedit crashed a few times. If it is the same in your case, you probably want to use a terminal-based editor like vi.\nPlease note that this is a workaround, the problem itself has to be fixed by the Chrome developers.\nUPDATE Nov 24th 2015\nAs Danilo Piazzalunga mentioned, the bug is confirmed. As NicDumZ suggested, please vote up this bug by clicking on\n\nto raise attention. Thanks!\nUPDATE Feb 20th 2016\nAs reported first by Ron Thompson and 3vi1 in the comment section; and finally confirmed by myself (using Ubuntu 15.10), this workaround doesn't seem to work anymore, at least not for everyone, after reinstalling google-chrome. Everybody who used this workaround should try to avoid reinstalling chrome.\nI again encourage you to say that you are affected by the bug on launchpad (currently 302 people).\nUPDATE April 5th 2016 (Working fix!)\nA fix has been proposed on launchpad that apparently did the job for a couple of people:\nTo apply the fix, change line #198 in the file /usr/bin/xdg-settings from\ncommand=\"`grep -E \"^Exec(\\[[^]=]*])?=\" \"$file\" | cut -d= -f 2- | sed -e 's/ .*$//'`\"\n\nto\ncommand=\"`grep -E \"^Exec(\\[[^]=]*])?=\" \"$file\" | cut -d= -f 2- | sed -e 's/ .*$//' | head -n 1`\"\n\nUPDATE July 25th 2016 (Working fix!)\nUpdate to the proposed fix for (K)Ubuntu 16.04:\nTo apply the fix, change lines #177 and #202 in the file /usr/bin/xdg-settings from\ncommand=\"`grep -E \"^Exec(\\[[^]=]*])?=\" \"$file\" | cut -d= -f 2- | first_word\"\n\nto\ncommand=\"`grep -E \"^Exec(\\[[^]=]*])?=\" \"$file\" | cut -d= -f 2- | first_word | head -n 1`\"\nThen go to Google Chrome settings and set Chrome as default browser.\nUPDATE Jun 1st 2017\nThe Bug has been closed and marked as \"Fix Released\" as of today. Quoting the user Olivier Tilloy (osomon):\n\nIf I read the report correctly, the issue was fixed in xdg-utils in xenial.

I wish to configure and use a Tata Photon Max Wifi Dongle as my internet connection. When I plug it into my brand new system, it does not get listed automatically although the lights on the device start blinking.\nCan somebody please guide me on the steps to configure my usb modem?\nPS: The usb modem works fine on my Windows 7 laptop.\nThanks\n\nA: I resolved the issue myself and got my internet connection to work. Not all the information available on the internet is organized. I will try to put forward the solution in a concise manner. I am using a Tata Photon Max Wifi dongle (EC315).\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window with root privileges and run the \"lsusb\" command.\n\n*Identify your device by the name of the manufacturer (Eg: Huawei) and note down the Vendor ID and Product ID details (Eg: 12d1:1f01).\n\n*Go to the /etc folder and check if there is a usb_modeswitch.conf file. If not, then usb_modeswitch needs to be installed first.\n\n*Go to the /usr/share/usb_modeswitch folder. Inside, there will be an archive file called configPack.tar.gz. Extract the contents of the file in a separate location and identify the config file corresponding to your device. For example, it may be named as 12d1:1f01 depending upon the output of your lsusb command.\n\n*Note the following values from that file: TargetVendor and MessageContent.\n\n*Edit the /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf file and append the following lines:\n\n\nDefaultVendor= 0x12d1\nDefaultProduct= 0x1f01\nTargetVendor= 0x12d1\nTargetProduct= 0x0031\nMessageContent=\"5553424312345678000000000000061e000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease make sure that you put the right entry. DefaultVendor and DefaultProduct can be obtained from the lsusb command; TargetVendor and MessageContent from the file I mentioned above. TargetProduct will be 0x0031. 0x0031 represents a modem.\nSave it and close the file.\n\n\n*Open a new terminal window and run the following command:\n\n\nsudo usb_modeswitch ‐c /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf\nThis will activate your internet connection and a notification message will be displayed after a couple of seconds. The connection will be marked as a wired connection.\nPlease note that the changes in the usb_modeswitch.conf file need to be performed only once. However, the \"sudo usb_modeswitch ‐c /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf\" command may need to be run every time the computer is restarted. One may bypass this requirement by updating the \".profile\" file under your home folder so that this command is executed automatically every time at logon.\nI hope this will resolve the issue and the internet connection should be good to go.\n", "Q: How to add “Refresh” option to right click menu in Ubuntu 15.04 I tried to use below steps to add refresh option in Ubuntu 15.04 but getting error \nE: Unable to locate package nautilus-refresh.\nSame steps worked fine in Ubuntu 14.04.

Please work through my wall of text, need help!! Thank you!\nBooting up my laptop this morning, I encountered the following problem:\nBoot to black screen with no responsiveness, couldn't even get to tty1 from there.\nThen got to a console by pressing F3 on the boot-up splash with the Ubuntu logo and the dots, logged in and tried stopping/starting lightdm manually with the following error messages:\nstop: Job has already been stopped: lightdm\nstart: Job failed to start\n\nSo I started digging into log files to try and figure out what is going wrong. /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log has the following lines:\nDEBUG: Process 1754 terminated with signal 6\nDEBUG: DisplayServer x-0: X server stopped\nDEBUG: Releasing VT 7\nDEBUG: DisplayServer x-0: Removing X server authority /var/run/lightdm/root/:0\nDEBUG: Seat: Display server stopped\nDEBUG: Seat: Stopping; greeter display server failed to start\n\nThat ought to be an xorg problem somehow then, right? I checked /var/log/lightdm/x-0.log\nLoading extension GLK\n(EE)\nFatal server error:\n(EE) no screens found(EE)\n(EE)\n\nand in /var/log/Xorg.0.log when it tries to (i assume) find the drivers, it is looking for intel, intel, modestting, fbdev, vesa - cannot open any and:\n(EE) No drivers available.\n(EE)\nFatal server error:\n(EE) no screens found(EE)\n(EE)\n\nI tried a lot of reinstalling / reconfiguring lightdm and trying out gdm, to no success - which makes sense given it seems to be a driver/display issue?!\nSo here is background on that: Yd, I installed bumblebee and nvidia-352 and got it working for the first time. I did not boot to black screen and could configure bumblebee, such that glxsphere64 either uses the intel driver or the nvidia driver and card with optirun.\nAt that point, I installed, after a lot of installing/finding required packages, CUDA 7.5 as well, tested it on the cuda-test deviceQuery and got the expected results. I then also installed matlab all before rebooting / shutting down. It is after this shutdown that the problems occured - so either something happened to the bumblebee config or the cuda install, yes? I cannot for the life of me figure out what is going on, I am not very proficient at these tings..\n/etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia points to the right places, I did manage to load up the nvidia card/driver with optirun so thats expected.\n/etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf only has 1 unexpected line, it says:\nVirtualDisplay=:8\n\nand I cannot figure out if that is an expected entry here, don't wanna fiddle around with it though.\nsudo X -configure tells me I have a missing output driver.\nI tried removing the Xorg.conf files, with no results. bumblebee also is not loaded up on the limited boot-up I am getting, as I have no experience I do not know if that is expected. sudo service bumblebee start starts it no problem, but that does not solve any issues as far as I can see. lsmod | grep nvidia and lsmod | grep nouveau do not give any results, I should expect that as nouveau is not installed and the nvidia drivers should only be used for optirun apps, yea? lsmod | grep i9 gives back i915 as well as video *stuff* i915 - that is the kernel driver for my onboard graphics unit, correct? With lspci | grep VGA it returns the Haswell Integrated Graphics Controller.\nSo, has anyone any clue what might be going wrong here? \nRedoing the driver/bumblebee install is of course always an option - as it was such a hassle I am trying to avoid it in fear of not reproducing it or ending up at the same spot. \nIf I have to resort to it anyway: Do you think I can just keep the CUDA install? Will matlab figure out a newly installed graphics driver?\nHere is an update: \nI could not figure out anyway to fix this, so I reinstalled, went through the same steps to set up bumblebee and the nvidia-352 drivers - up to here it works! What is different is this: I did not explicitly install virtualgl and libraries so i cannot test with glxspheres64 for example - will that be problematic? What is the best ppa to add to install all that, its does not seem to be in the standard package? I also did not install cuda, I suspect that is where it went wrong! Does installing cuda via package manager and the 1.9GB Deb file also overwrite openGL stuff?\n\nA: Hmm sounds like an nvidia-driver problem!\nCan you uninstall cuda? maybe that is the problem.\nDid you update before shutting down?\nThat may also be a problem!\nThe instructions come from here: Nvidia Driver and Heating Problem\nIn terminal:\nremove CUDA (I don't know how)\nreinstall bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia nvidia-352 nvidia-352-uvm primus nvidia-cuda-toolkit libcuda1-352\nWith the nvidia-352-uvm package you actually have CUDA.\nconfigure bumblebee like this:\nsudo nano /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n\nline 22: Driver=nvidia\n\nline 55: KernelDriver=nvidia-352\n\nline 58: LibraryPath=/usr/lib/nvidia-352:/usr/lib32/nvidia-352\n\nline 61: XorgModulePath=/usr/lib/nvidia-352/xorg,/usr/lib/xorg/modules\n\nblacklist it:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf\n\nmake sure the line\nblacklist nvidia-352\n\nis there\nFinally add the intel driver and bumblebee switch (bbswitch) to /etc/modules\nsudo nano /etc/modules\n\nadd those lines:\ni915\nbbswitch\n\nThen it should work alright.\nSamsung NP550P5C S02 intel core i5-3210m+ Intel HD 4000, Geforce GT 650M\nEDIT:\n1 last thing:\nYou may need to run these commands to get cuda and blender working:\nsudo modprobe nvidia-uvm //loads nvidia-uvm\nsudo blender             // run blender as superuser, else it doesn't recognize it the first time (you dont need optirun/primusrun for cuda)\n\nthen select \"CUDA\" in the user preferences.. then close blender.\nAfterwards for the rest of the day you can use blender cuda without sudo\nOnly do this if it doesnt work Out-Of-The-Box\n", "Q: Delete all files except specified files/folders using command line?

And/Or permanently remove Linux 4.2.0-16-generic?\n\nA: Install Synaptic and remove 4.2 kernel image and headers.\nYou removed only meta-packages.\n", "Q: Does GRUB show the boot menu after kernel updates? This is NOT a dual boot question.\nIf only one single OS is installed GRUB does not show the boot menu by default.\nIt can be adjusted to show the boot menu whenever desired.  \nReference : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 \nDoes the GRUB menu appear after any kernel updates ?\nDo kernel updates trigger GRUB to show the boot menu ?\n\nA: Technically , no. After kernel install Ubuntu does run a script to reconfigure grub, so that it's menu is updated to include new kernel as the main entry and push the older entries into Advanced Options for Ubuntu menu.\nWhat may have happened is that you have edited at some point /etc/default/grub file , but didn't not run sudo update-grub, so everything stayed the old way. New kernel arrived, ran that update-grub command, and now it shows the menu.\nI doubt the updates contain any command to change grub settings, and I'd be very surprised if they do\n", "Q: find list of installed device drivers ubuntu How can I find out list of all device drivers installed in my ubuntu. I need list of device drivers not kernel drivers.\n\nA: Device drivers in Linux (and Ubuntu) are called \"kernel modules\". In fact, they are more than \"device drivers\" as they can provide functionality beyond serving the real hardware like creating virtual devices or providing new functionality for the kernel.\nUse lsmod or cat /proc/modules commands to see the list of modules loaded into the kernel. To see all modules stored on the disk (not necessarily loaded), run:\nls -R /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/\n\nAll above concerns modules loaded from the disk. The Linux kernel also has built-in (or statically compiled) modules that aren't shown by the above commands. This is especially valid for embedded systems that are usually optimized by storage. You can list built-in modules using:\ncat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.builtin\n\nThis command assumes your distro is providing modules.builtin file.\n", "Q: How to set TOOL_CHAIN_TAG while compiling EDK2 I am trying to compile EDK2 following these instructions.

Please try again later.\" to the new interface as you can see in the photos.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: What solved this for me is setting media.mediasource.webm.enabled to true in about:config\nI also have the following keys set to true manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*media.mediasource.enabled\n\n*media.fragmented-mp4.exposed\n\n*media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled\nThese settings let you adjust the video quality as well (to me it does not work out of the box, everything is only available on 360p). Here is the full config I have, for reference:\nSettings for media.fragmented*:\n\nSettings for media.mediasource*:\n\n\nA: Works fine for me. I would suggest to set YouTube to always use HTML5. If you still have issues, then please add the info you get when you click \"Learn More\" to your question. (Turns out there is no further useful information.)\n\nInvestigation and troubleshooting\nI think I was able to reproduce this issue and up until now I didn't modify any settings in about:config as Zoltan mentions while HTML5 versions of YouTube and Vimeo have both been working fine for me. I just installed gstreamer1.0-libav which got me this far on YouTube's HTML5 page:\n\nRegarding your error message, as I said I never modified related settings in Firefox or installed any extensions or plug-ins that might change these on your behalf. You should check entries beginning with media. in your about:config and reset them back to default via double click or context menu → reset. You can or should leave the media.gmp- settings alone, then restart Firefox and HTML5 YouTube should be working as intended. The is as close to the default as possible with libav/ffmpeg providing the necessary codecs.\nThe issue seems to be triggered by an inconsistent configuration, which confuses YouTube, especially you when don't restart Firefox and Flash is also still in the mix (you should restrict usage of Flash and only enable it when necessary). Another trigger could be that H.264 and VPx content gets mixed one video would play, but the other has issues and cause the message you got. I imagine an ad loading before the actual video, the ad would not play, playback would not continue and throw the error message, while the actual video would have played just fine. N.B. I'm a NoScript user and notice that I don't see as much ad clips as I see without.\nReproducibly enable all HTML5 video features\n\nWith everything set to a default (reproducible) state you can try to enable all features on the HTML5 page. Here is how:\nInstall gstreamer1.0-libav or the latest available version of the package if you haven't already. Then set the following settings to true in about:config (the current default in Firefox 41 is false):\nmedia.mediasource.enabled;true\nmedia.mediasource.webm.enabled;true\nmedia.fragmented-mp4.exposed;true\nmedia.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled;true\n\nThe following are just to check, they should be enabled by default:\nmedia.gstreamer.enabled;true\nmedia.webm.enabled;true\n\n\nA: I've run into this problem as well. The youtube html5 gives me a blue checkmark on all options. If you play a video, then it works. However, if you disable webm, then it fails like in the top post.\nLooking into it further, you find that it fails to play every video of type \"video/mp4\", which basically means that the h264 decoder is recognised (as shown by youtube) but not working.\nThe obvious solution is to enable webm/vp9. Which works for youtube (partially), but not everything else.\nSo far, I haven't found a solution for everything.\n\nA: about:config\nswitch media.fragmented-mp4.use-blank-decoder  to true.\nOther settings:\nmedia.mediasource.mp4.enabled to true\nmedia.fragmented-mp4.* to true\n\nA: Accepted answer didn't work for me. Installing RestrictedFormats somehow helped:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nAfter that An error occurred. Please try again later message still appears but at leas the video loads a second later or after a reload.\n", "Q: Can gufw profiles be switched automatically? In gufw, you can set up different profiles (home, office, ...) with different rules.\nThis is cool, but: Is there a way to automatically select a profile, depending on the presence of a wifi access point for example ?\nI couldn't find any information on that in the docs (in fact the possibility to have different profiles is barely mentioned, except for the screenshots...)\n\nA: It's not possible with gufw. gufw is a GUI for ufw (and ufw configures iptables). ufw doesn't know anything about the gufw profiles. You have to use ufw to enable/disable rules which are defined in your gufw profiles, E.g.\nufw allow in http \nufw reject out smtp\n\nFor more examples and the usage of ufw use man ufw in your terminal.\n\nYour next question on Ask Ubuntu should be: \"How can I change my firewall settings in dependency of my network environment?\"\n\nA: No, I don't believe so, however it appears that NetworkManager supports Fedora's FirewallD, which allows configuration of a firewall zone for each network connection (such as Wifi SSIDs).  It is available in Ubuntu 15.10, but the graphical configuration utility, firewall-config, apparently is not, which means configuring it is left to the cli firewall-cmd application.\n", "Q: guake at right side monitor in dual display environment - Ubuntu 15.10(Wily Werewolf)) Ok, This might be helpful to someone. \nIn Ubuntu 15.10 guake has changed a little bit.

Putting these options in /etc/ssh/ssh_config will make the change for all users on the system which is often undesirable.  Additionally, these changes will not be portable were you to move your home directory for another server.

The existing Unity search lens does not do full-text search of document contents; rather, only the document names themselves. There was a lens called \"recoll-lens\" which leveraged Recoll to do a full text search which was packaged up through 12.04 Precise (as other answers mentioned back in 2011, here, here), but there is no official backport of recoll-lens packaged for 14.04.\nDoes anyone know of a repository which contains recoll-lens for 14.04, or if there are any other full-text search Unity lenses which work for 14.04?\n(While I realize that 14.04 is not the last stable point release, it is the last stable LTS release as of the moment that I'm asking this question (10/2015), and the Ubuntu installs that I manage are on a LTS-only policy for stability).\n\nA: OK, so after more sleuthing, I've found that the recoll-lens package was renamed to unity-scope-recoll.\nSo, by running:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:recoll-backports/recoll-1.15-on\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install recoll unity-scope-recoll\n\nAs an aside:\nI like to have my file content search results kept up to date with changes immediately(with an SSD drive this isn't a big performance issue), so I configured recoll to index immediately and to start up the indexer when I log in:\nRecoll real time indexing screenshot\n", "Q: Update of 15.10 password problems I have updated to 15.10 successfully, Password not working so remounted drive reset password and got message successful, Started ubuntu again but password still not recognised.

After the update process, system was supposed to reboot on its own. I kept waiting for the automatic reboot for quite long until I lost my patience and tried shutting down the system from the systems menu, to which nothing happened. I tried the system restart as well, and from the terminal as well but nothing happened. Finally I forced the power shut down. Now when I tried to switch it on, it won't boot. After several tries and a bit of research I found the way to boot it, but the system is now very very very slow to work on, despite the 8GB RAM. The way it reboots now is also very typical. When I switches it on, it won't boot and a purple screen persists forever. I have to force the power shut down and then switch it back again post which the advanced reboot menu appears. I've to select the (systemd) option, (upstart) and (recovery mode) won't work. Attached is the screenshot of the same. Post this an error screen appears related to ACPI and controller version, and then the OS loading screen.\n\nNow, I've three questions before I loose my patience and re-format the system.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make the system boot default in systemd mode. Evertime I want to use my system I've to switch it on, then force shut down, then start again and select the systemd option.\n\n*Secondly, why is everything behaving so slow. Is there any way I can boost the things?\n\n*Thirdly, can I downgrade back to 14.04 without loosing any data?\n\n\nA: To make the systemd boot be the default, check to see if you have installed the systemd-sysv package (apt-cache policy systemd-sysv). If not, then go ahead and install it; it will likely ask if you want to remove upstart-sysv, and this is fine. If it is already installed, then reinstall it (sudo apt-get reinstall systemd-sysv).\n", "Q: Enable WiFi not showing up on a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10 I recently switched from Elementary OS to Ubuntu 15.10 for Virtualbox,\nbut when I completed the installation and tried to connect to my local WiFi network, there was no Enable WiFi button.

My Host OS is Windows 8.1 64-bit. The VM has 2 GB of dedicated memory, from the 8GB on the host. \nI first set up the machine to use only a 8 GB VDI, since I just wanted to test it. After deciding to upgrade, I wiped my previous 30 GB Partition and needed to add it to the vdi file. I mostly followed this guide. In the end, I keep on running into a problem with grub and keep recieving a error while trying to boot.\nerror: attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0' .\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of what I have done in my most recent attempt.\nFirst, I used VBoxManage to increase the size of the VDI to 30 Gb.\nWhen I tried to run GParted from a separate VM, it froze while booting, so instead I booted the Ubuntu VM from a ISO, and ran GParted there.\nNext, I deleted the swap space partition and the extended partition.\nI resized the main partition to be 28 GB.\nI rebuilt the extended partition and then the swap partition, with 2 GB.\nThere was an enormous amount of unallocated space available, around 30 TB (I am using a 128 GB SSD), I believe this was because the VDI file is dynamically allocated, so I ignored the space, but I left it located after every other partition.\nI turned off the VM, removed the ISO from the VM, and started it up.\nI received an error while booting:\nerror: attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0' .\n\nAfter searching for a solution, I tried:\ngrub rescue> ls\ngrub rescue> ls(hd0,1)/\ngrub rescue> set root=(hd0,1)\ngrub rescue> set prefix=(hd0,1)/boot/grub\ngrub rescue> insmod normal\n\nAnd received another error\nerror: attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0' .\n\nI had no idea what to do here, so I restarted the VM, booting from the Ubuntu ISO again and ran boot repair. Here is the report.\nAfter starting the VM again I run into the same error that occurred before trying the boot repair software. I tried the same solution and received the same error after grub rescue> insmod normal\nThis is the point where I have exhausted my knowledge and the possible solutions I could find online.\nI realize that in the amount of time I have dedicated to this project I could have created a new VM and reinstalled all of my software, but I am stuck in a whitewhale situation. The solution has become more important to me than the results. \nAny ideas?\n(It seems I am only allowed to create two links, I will try to add the image links as a comment on the OP.)\n\nA: Your disk uses old format from 80's: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record\n\nThe organization of the partition table in the MBR limits the maximum\n  addressable storage space of a disk to 2 TB (2^32 × 512 bytes).\n\nYou need to switch to gpt. \n", "Q: Bluetooth problem!

I tried to add the line set fileencodings=utf-8 in the .vimrc file, but nothing changed. How can I solve this ?\n\nA: When all your chars are < 128 ASCII and UTF-8 are the same.\nASCII is a subset of UTF-8 (and also a subset of latin1 and many other encoding formats).\nProbably everything is perfect!\n\nThe configuration command:\nset fileencodings=list of encoding formats to try\nis used to define the order of encoding format that vim will try to\nuse when opening \na file. \nset fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,latin1 is a better idea: first try\nto use any Unicode with a BOM header, then it will try to interpret it as UTF-8, and if everything fails latin1.\n\nA: In your .vimrc, add\nset encoding=utf-8\n\nand restart Vim.

I'd like to ifdown ifup, enter pass, ssh, enter pass, and scope to that shell.\n\nA: Nope. you can't expect to run bash commands in an expect interpreter, just like you can't run perl commands in a python interpreter -- they're different languages.

It became ens32, which was renamed from eth0. After I changed /etc/network/interfaces network communication was enabled again.\nBut - why does this happen at all? And if it happens, shouldn't the interfaces file be updated automatically?\nNow that I deleted the virtual network card and created another one, eth0 becomes eno16777728, which is not so, uhm, nice.\nShould this behaviour (at least that of the upgrade procedure) be reported as a bug?\nFurthermore, is /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules obsolete now? And (although only partly related) what about /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules?)\nEdit - additional question (after accepted answer)\nThe dependency of /etc/network/interfaces from the actual interface name bothered me. I tried a new installation of *ubuntu in another virtual machine. To my surprise, /etc/network/interfaces contained a reference to the loopback device only. However, with my original VM this change prevented the network to come up. So what else do I need to change?\nEdit\nWell, from another test I found that a new Ubuntu Server has the network interface card in /etc/network/interfaces, while XUbuntu has not. Maybe it is using network-manager or something else.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf), starting with systemd/udev will automatically assign predictable, stable network interface names for all local Ethernet, Wlan and Wwan interfaces (source).\nThe following different naming schemes for network interfaces are now supported by udev natively:\n\n\n*\n\n*Names incorporating Firmware/BIOS provided index numbers for on-board devices (example: eno1)\n\n*Names incorporating Firmware/BIOS provided PCI Express hotplug slot index numbers (example: ens1)\n\n*Names incorporating physical/geographical location of the connector of the hardware (example: enp2s0)\n\n*Names incorporating the interfaces's MAC address (example: enx78e7d1ea46da)\n\n*Classic, unpredictable kernel-native ethX naming (example: eth0) - deprecated\n\n\nBy default, systemd will now name interfaces following policy:\n\n\n*\n\n*if that information from the firmware is applicable and available, falling back to \n\n*if that information from the firmware is applicable and available, falling back to \n\n*if applicable, falling back to \n\n*is not used by default, but is available if the user chooses so. \n\n*in all other cases.  \n\n\nHow do you disable this?\nYou basically have the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your own manual naming scheme, for example by naming your interfaces internet0, or lan0. For that create your own udev rules file and set the name property for the devices. Make sure to order it before the default policy file, for example by naming it /etc/udev/rules.d/70-my-net-names.rules\n\n*Alter the default policy file, for picking a different naming scheme, for example for naming all interface names after their MAC address by default: cp /lib/udev/rules.d/80-net-setup-link.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-setup-link.rules, then edit the file there and change the lines as necessary.\n\n*Pass the net.ifnames=0 on the kernel command line.\n\n\nA: I know this may be a little late and the adding of the 10-network.rules seems to have helped but not completely. I had to add the kernel name of the device to rename. Here's how I got the /etc/udev/rules.d/10-network.rules to work...\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", ATTR{address}==\"MAC:ADDRESS\",KERNEL==\"enp4s8\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\nand change the KERNEL==\"\" to what your kernel is naming the device when it boots.\nHTH\nK.C.\n\nA: There is an easier way told by the ArchWiki Beginnersguide.\nFirst get your devices MAC Address by\n$ ip link\n\nThe output show by like\n3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000     \n          link/ether 20:68:9d:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n\nYour devices MAC address is the\n20:68:9d:xx:xx:xx\n\nJust create the file (simply open with sudo rights in a text editor)\n$ nano /etc/udev/rules.d/10-network.rules    \n\nAdd following line\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", ATTR{address}==\"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff\", NAME=\"net1\"\n\nReplace name with your wanted name and aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff with your devices MAC address.\nNow just reboot your computer and the device name should have changed.\n\nA: If you have a fresh install\napt-get remove biosdevname\n\nThen \nupdate-initramfs -u\n\nCheck to see if you have udev net ruels file. If so, remove it.\nrm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\n\nNow edit /etc/network/interfaces, rename the interfaces to eth0, eth1, ...etc.\nReboot\n\nA: I got this working by creating file:\nroot@odroid:~# cat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth0\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\n\nA: Try this: \nEdit your /etc/default/grub.\nChange the line from\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0\"\n\nand, finally run:\n# update-grub\n\nas root, and reboot your system.\n", "Q: mounting cifs windows share from HP scanner prompts for password when it shouldn't?

(Notify me if I'm inaccurate anywhere.)\n\n*Download from the Nautilus snapshots website the version of Nautilus that you are currently using.  To find that out, run nautilus --version from the terminal.  After downloading the archive, unzip it to whatever directory you want to work from.\n\n*From within the unzipped package, open the file nautilus-icon-info.h.  Within the first several lines you will see various sizes designated for the particular scroll-setting options.  For instance, within the file for version 3.20.4 the icon sizes start on line 36.  Change each of those levels to whatever you want to use so that you can make the icons much smaller (or larger).\n\n*After editing and saving the file, it's time to configure, compile, and install.  Run the following commands from the terminal from within the base directory of the version of nautilus that you have downloaded and unzipped.  Make sure that you are within the base of the folder structure of the nautilus directories!\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThese can be run altogether with the command \n./configure && make && make install\n\nIf the ./configure command fails it's because you are missing some other dependencies.  I apologize if my list of dependencies above was incomplete.  Google (or whatever search engine you want) to find what package it is that you need.  You can use Synaptic to search for what you need if you're unsure even after Googling.\nOnce installed, I suggest a reboot just to make sure that every single thing is reloaded properly.  You can now tweak with your icon sizes as you wish.\nHave fun!\n\nA: According to this Google+ post, starting from Nautilus 3.15, it seem that the \"small\" icon size 64, is the smallest option available (so the new \"zoom\" slider will not work as intended).\nMore details in this GNOME Git commit.\nThere are more informations and some are misleading.  Also, I found somewhere on GNOME bugs a mention that it will not be fixed  as the decision was taken as temporary solution for a bug elsewhere.\nAt this moment the only solution (not tested) seem to be rebuild of nautilus using different icon size for \"small\".

If you are able to mount manually then I'll bet the mount parameters for your device are missing in these 2 files and automounting will not occur without the mount parameters are in at least 1 of these 2 files. \n  To edit these files, go to a terminal and type in \" sudo gedit /etc/fstab \" (sans quotes). Enter your password when asked and the file will open in gedit, ready to edit as needed.\n  man mount, man fstab, and man mtab can also be helpful for particulars as well, but the command that you spoke of using to manually mount appended to the files should put this problem to rest.

The process seemed to run fine except for stopping occasionally to ask me to keep or overwrite certain configuration files (about the meaning of which I had no idea).\nI went away when it started applying the upgrade, and returned to see a screen listing a bunch of apparent tasks, some appearing in red to indicate (presumably) a problem. The last item looked successful, but the screen did not change. Finally, I switched power off.  Now I cannot boot Ubuntu at all.\nHow do I get 15.10 to boot?\n\nA: I finally concluded that the system had completed the UBUNTU 15.10 install, but did not leave the system in a condition where it would boot and load xwindows and the Unity interface.  I rebooted and used the recovery mode at the grub OS Selection screen, went to the root prompt, ran startx and unity, and ended up with a low-res incorrect aspect ratio. \nThe upgrade failed to keep my /home mountpoint on the drive and partition UBUNTU 15.04 had used (not the boot drive and partition).  I had mistakenly thought the whole idea of setting up a separate /home drive & partition was to facilitate upgrades without disturbing data.  So, I set out to change the /home mount point from the boot partition to the previous /home, and then deleted the existing /home.  That was a big mistake because after that, UNITY menu and dash disappeared, and the gui crashed.\nBy this time my complaining had gotten me stifled on askubuntu, so I could not ask further help for some days.  In frustration, I simply installed UBUNTU 15.10 Gnome over the top of the existing installation.\nIncidentally, I first tried installing from the Live DVD, but the installer did not recognize that I wanted to upgrade, maybe because it detected an existing upgrade.  I wonder why the developers don't put messages on the screen explaining such decisions that will confuse users.\nI aborted that install and installed from a distribution on my YUMI Multiboot SanDisk Extreme USB flash drive.  The install went EXTREMELY quickly.\nIn the process, using the installer's partitioning manager, I set /home to the existing drive and partition the 15.04 installation had used as /home.  When I finished the install, UBUNTU had ignored the mount point and set its own /home folder in the boot drive (an SSD without much space left).  Now I must ask what went wrong and how to do it correctly next time so that the mountpoint STICKS on the existing /home at the non-boot drive and partition.\nAt least I have a perfectly functioning Gnome UBUNTU 15.10 on my dual boot system.  I only need now to change the /home mountpoint and reinstall all the old apps the new install wiped out.\n", "Q: Installing Nvidia drivers and CUDA I am a beginner on Ubuntu and want to install CUDA on Ubuntu 14.04 for running some parallel code for my projects.

I tried to reconfivute nouveau-firmware but afte a fresh upgrade presumably everything has just been reconfigured?\n\nA: Answering my own question, it seems 15.10 upgrade re-installed bumblebee perhaps other things which are no longer needed (breaks things) for my nvidia optimus setup.\nI now have\n\n\n*\n\n*no nvidia packages\n\n*xserver-xorg-video-nouveau drivers installed (cant be removed anyway)\n\n*no nvidia-prime (via aptitude purge)\n\n*no bumblebee    (via aptitude purge)\n\n*no xorg.conf at all, which is a bit strange\n\n\nThis boots and I can see each graphics card is working, test with\nDRI_PRIME=0 glxgears\nDRI_PRIME=1 glxgears\n\nYou can see that the nvidia card has rendering issues, but the Intel one works ok.\nIts pretty crashy, seems sleep breaks more regularly and the system freezes every now and again, but it turns on.\nAn I have that warm feeling you get from using open source drivers. :)\nMoral of the story is don't buy hardware with nvidia optimus.\nN.B. Don't trust the information in Ubuntu's  Software & Updates > Additional Drivers tab.  I don't know where that info comes from or how it configures the system but it breaks things with Optimus.  You loose the whole desktop if something goes wrong with graphics drivers so a GUI on configuring graphics drivers is a silly idea!  I used aptitude/dpkg and deleted a few files relaveted to nvidia and bumblebee that aptitude purge had missed.\n", "Q: Reinstalling Ubuntu 15.10: \"Removing conflicting operating system files\" has been running for almost 24 hours The process is not stuck because the terminal shows \"progress\", it keeps trying to remove files that it can't find, the messages read something like: /..../file x: Warning: Source ID XXXXXX was not found when attempting to remove it\nThe reason I am reinstalling is because my installation was messed up when I installed ubuntu-touch and the system wouldn't reboot. \nI was able to fire up a live USB through grub and start the installation process, I figured it would be possible to simply reinstall but it seems to be taking forever. Is this normal behavior? Should I stop it and simply go with a fresh install instead?\nThanks!\n\nA: The main question is: do you have a separate /home partition?\nIf so then just erase your / and leave /home untouched, just set mountpoint to it. \nIf not and there is some important files then I recommend you mount your partition and remove everything except /home, e.g.\nfdisk -l\n\nExamine the output and find appropriate device name\nmount /dev/sdaXY /mnt  # use the device name from fdisk -l here\nmkdir /mnt/2rm         # create working dir\nmv /mnt/* /mnt/2rm     # move all dirs to work dir\nmv /mnt/2rm/home /mnt  # return home back\nrm -rfv /mnt/2rm       # now we can safely delete the rest\n\nAfter the above manipulations you can easily install Ubuntu on the same partition.

Specifically my input I want to change the colours in my Terminal and a cursory Google search shows me to right click in terminal and go to properties, etc.\nSo I managed to change my background, and the text, but I was wondering if I can have what I type be one colour and the system prompts be a different colour?\n\nUbuntu 14.04. Running it as a VM on a host Windows 7.\n\nA: For changing the background (and text) colours, you simply go to profile preferences and set it there:\n\nFor the prompt itself, this is set in the prompt itself, this is more complex. This is set from the ~/.bashrc hidden file (or another similar file), probably using a line like this (it will begin with PS1):\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\n\nThe colour in the prompt is set using escape codes (if the terminal being used supports it)- so basically each bit of \\033[Nm sets the format for the following text, depending on what N (N can be multiple things separated by ; BTW). \nFor the basic colours, you can use the simple numeric codes listed here:\n\n1 Makes stuff bold, 0 resets - multiple things can be used as well - e.g:\necho -e \"\\033[1;32mExample\\033[0m\"\n\nOtherwise you can set your own colour (probably limited support):\necho -e \"\\033[38;2;240;115;0mOrange\\033[0m\"\n\nSo you can fairly easily edit the PS1 line to suit (and test it with echo -e ...). I recently did this with various colours for different machines so I could use multiple terminals without typing the right command into the wrong computer...\n", "Q: How to overcome the ALT key issue in blender?

Is there any way to solve this problem? Any help would be highly appreciated!\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Sometimes it is impossible to prevent applications from trying to adjust the microphone level. With Ubuntu, it is at least possible to prevent ALSA from responding to such requests.\nIn the configuration file /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-input-internal-mic.conf (you might have to look for the correct file for your microphone, see below), I changed to part\n[Element Capture]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = merge\noverride-map.1 = all\noverride-map.2 = all-left,all-right\n\nto\n[Element Capture]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = 40\noverride-map.1 = all\noverride-map.2 = all-left,all-right\n\nand after a sudo alsa force-reload, applications don't magically change the microphone volume anymore.\nAbove, we use volume = 40, which corresponds to the numeric value shown in alsamixer below the green level control fader as shown here: .\nIf you want to set the volume to the \"native\" volume of your microphone (0dB of the hardware, without added \"mic boost\" that can add static noise), adjust this volume number until the top left of alsamixer shows db gain: 0.00, like so:\n\nHow to determine the .conf file for your microphone\n\n*\n\n*Run pacmd list-sources.\n\n\n*In the output, search for the index: section listing the desired device, e.g.\n  * index: 6\n    name: <alsa_input.usb-Blue_Microphones_Yeti_Stereo_Microphone_REV8-00.analog-stereo>\n    ...\n    active port: <analog-input-mic>\n\n\n\n*The active port part at the end contains the file name you need to edit in /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/.\nIn the above example, it is <analog-input-mic>, so we would edit /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-input-mic.conf for this mic.\n", "Q: Getting grub message after deleting Ubuntu partition and unable to boot into Windows?

Follow the steps in the bug work around and see if that fixes it for you\n\nA: First to answer your question - file a detailed bug report on launchpad containing the steps you attempted and an explanation of all problems you experienced during the installation process !  \nYou have to know that Canonical tries to build the installer making it as convenient as possible for all users with different levels of knowledge concerning partitioning and boot procedures.  \nIn most of the cases the issues are generated by the users themselves doing something wrong.\nSo before providing your bug report on launchpad please try the following installation method.  \nStep 1 : Backup the data you want to keep to an external disk or a separate partition.  \nStep 2 : Create a proper installation media using Brasero for DVD or Disks for USB.\nStep 3 : Prepare the partitions using GParted by formatting the system partition.  \nStep 4 : Start the Ubuntu installer and choose Something else from the menu.  \nStep 5 : Select the the (clean) system partition for root you formatted before.  \nStep 6 : Select the correct disk for the GRUB boot loader to install it to.  \nWhat reads as \"I already know this\" instructions ... if you carefully prepare all things before starting to install a new Ubuntu edition, only in very rarely something will not run smoothly.\n", "Q: Remove the blank space in vi editor created by \"set nu\" option I have used vi editor several times on many different machines, but I have never seen such an behavior of set nu option.\nThis is what my vi editor looks after I set the set nu option in .vimrc file in my home directory:\n\nAs clearly seen, some amount of whitespace is being created to the left of line numbers.

When the 'n' option is\n        excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped line will not use the column of\n        line numbers (this is the default when 'compatible' isn't set).\n        The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line\n        number.\n\nAnd in turn, from :h 'numberwidth':\n'numberwidth' 'nuw'     number  (Vim default: 4  Vi default: 8)\n                        local to window\n                        {not in Vi}\n                        {only available when compiled with the +linebreak\n                        feature}\n        Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.

Since one space is always between the number and\n        the text, there is one less character for the number itself.\n        The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to\n        fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of\n        rows in the window, depending on whether 'number' or 'relativenumber'\n        is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number\n        up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.\n        The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 10.\n        NOTE: 'numberwidth' is reset to 8 when 'compatible' is set.\n\nThat is, the default width is 4, but 8 when in compatible mode. vi in default Ubuntu is vim.tiny, which doesn't support nocompatible, so the width became 8. You need to install vim to get the normal behaviour.\nThat said, if you do wish to set a different minimum width, say 2, just do:\nset nuw=2\n\n", "Q: Viber won't start in Ubuntu 15.10 due to missing shared libraries libgstreamer-0.10.so.0 How to fix this?

The files have no metadata, and the fingerprinting tool is very inefficient (<50% mean accuracy).\nHowever, the titles are like this: \"(Song Name)-(Artist).(format)\", and they are almost perfect. I can write a sed to extract these.\nI need a way to be able to write a custom script that allows me to use the Picard's lookup feature, with the parameters I extract from sed (in-script) from the filename, and do a lookup. Is that possible?\nI am looking for guidelines, but an example would be great.\nAs @terdon requested, more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Picard has two modes of identifying a song: 1) Acoustic Fingerprinting, and 2) Lookup using existing metadata \n\n*For some reason, the first method, ie Acoustic Fingerprinting is giving me very poor result on a certain set of songs\n\n*However, my songs already have the correct Artist Name, Track Title in the filename, I just need to lookup the track to get Year, Cover Image etc.\n\n*The default lookup script (internal to Picard?) is using the complete file name, which has garbage in it to do a lookup, leading to inferior results\n\n*I would like to specify which part of the file name to use for the lookup, as I mention above.\n\n\nSomething like:\ni=\"Track Name/ File Name\"\n$artist=\"sed -r 's/.../\\1/'\" $i\n$track=\"sed -r 's/...\\2/'\" $i\nlookup($i, $artist, $track)\n\nOf course the scripting language for Picard may be different.\n\nA: It's possible to use a script, but that's not necessary.

Previously, I tried to do so and followed this link. I ended up a non-functioning oracle on ubuntu and a crashed one on windows, which worked fine earlier.

For instance example.com and www.example.com, as well as any other host name would have to have a separate entry in the name server configuration.\nAn example of this (in the name server zone file):\n(db.example.com.zone:)\nexample.com.

I configures this thing via SSH\nMy SSH connection wasn't interrupted by it. Even tho I'm not using Port 22 for my SSH. Not I've unlocked that special port for 47000+ too. Now I have both ports open on as well IPv4 and IPv6\nDo I need to have both unlocked? Can I delete the Port 22? I wouldn't ask this question if my SSH connection would have collapsed but now I'm confused what Port SSH really uses\nIs the 47000+ Port only used for the handshake?\nI'm sorry for this (near-to-irrelevant) question but I fear that I might never be able to SSH to my server again when I have a wrong Firewall config\n\nA: \nDo I need to have both unlocked?\n\nNo.\n\nCan I delete the Port 22?\n\nYes.\n\nI wouldn't ask this question if my SSH connection would have collapsed but now I'm confused what Port SSH really uses\n\nTypically, your existing connection will not be effected. We would have to see your resulting iptables rule set to know for certain, but your existing/related tcp connection should bypass the closed port check. You can verify by trying to make a new ssh session (as mentioned by the comment from @Joes).\n\nIs the 47000+ Port only used for the handshake?\n\nNo. That port will be used for all the SSH traffic.\n\nA: There are a few things you need to setup at minimum to have SSH working, and this configuration then changes down the line depending on what you wanna do.\nLets assume for everything right now, that you are on your own internal network and are keeping all the values default, for now until we know this works. then we will continue with an advanced config.\nFor now, no port forwarding is needed, that is the final step. For now we only need to know the service is enabled, what IP the remote machine has, and on what port the ssh-server daemon listening, and if the remote firewall is blocking incoming requests for SSH.\nstep 1 -install and enable the openSSH-server service (on the remote machine)\nstep 2-Disable firewall (on the remote machine)\nIf you're not 100% sure if you disabled the remote firewall or not, do:\nsudo service ufw status\nthere you will see its status, when active, let's disable it for now.\nsudo service ufw disable\nIf you have just installed openssh-server and you didn't change the config, the default port is set to 22. If you have changed the SSH config to listen on another port, restarting ssh-server service is required. The spawned SSH process is still cached in memory and will only start serving on a different port the moment a new SSH-server daemon process is spawned.\nAs such, do:\nsudo service ssh restart\nnow move over to the client PC. Ping the remote machine. That is step one for basic connectivity, but ping is a bad tool for testing protocol or service issues. They exist on different OSI layers. now open your ssh client, this can be putty or something else, or just a terminal window in linux works fine too.\nAfter doing above steps, this should really work to connect, if not, repeat previous steps or ask more questions.\nIf you kept things default, and its working, now would be the time to switch over the ssh port if desired. so for example let's say you changed the port from 22, to 2200 in the ssh-server config on remote machine, the next step would be to enable the firewall on remote machine, but this time add some rules after. As soon as the rules are loaded-in and the firewall is enabled, for good measure restart ufw service and ssh service once more, then try to connect.\nIf you changed the SSH port from 22 to 2200, you would have to\nALLOW a rule for TCP rule for PORT 2200 from ANY adress\nit will add the same rule for ipv6 automatically.\nif you are comfortable turning off UFW on remote machine for now that is fine too.\nNow that SSH is working on your local network, you can start configuring remote access. This is different for each router but about the same process.\nFind in the menu of your modem/router a category for port forwarding, usually under firewall/internet or IP configuration. when you found port forwarding, what you wanna do is forward an external port (this can be any port, comes down to personal preference and security) for example a random port, 8422. This would be the remote port that we connect to whenever we are outside. We forward this port, to the internal port 2200 that we have set on the machine.\nso instead of internal IP and port, now we use the external IP adress, and the external port. this is now configured to tunnel directly to the 2200 port on internal network, and should be reachable. if this last step gives you issues, restart modem/router and remote server completely. if that still doens't work, but the internal ssh does, you can be sure the configuration is not yet correct. Permission denied error sounds like you're trying to access SSH on the wrong port. so you can reach the machine, but the port that is requested for SSH is not serving that, so the permission is denied.\nHope this helped.\n", "Q: Dual Boot on Dell Inspiron 7559 laptop I have a new Dell Inspiron 7559 laptop running Windows 10 which requires an external DVD drive. I have tried to install Ubuntu versions 12.02, 14.04, and 15.10 with no luck. When I try to boot from the disk image in UEFI mode the process comes to a halt midway through. If I try to boot using the legacy mode, then the installer does not find the Windows OS. Since I want a dual boot system, I exit from the process here. Also, the installer does not find the Wi-Fi link. Does anyone know the source of this problem? I theorize that It could be that Ubuntu is not Windows 10 savvy, or that the installer cannot use the internal hardware as this is a very new design. Comments?\n\nA: I am having the same issue with the exact same model. Dell Inspirion 15 7559 with 6th gen intel i7, nvidia geforce gtx 960m.\nWill post if successful...\n(Be sure to read everything below this line.)\nEDIT: Got it working\nSo the problem is with the new processor architecture not being fully supported by this version. (6th gen Intel requores Linux 4.3 .)

In addition to the steps I listed above, you also need to disable secure boot in the BIOS.  If you do not disable secure boot, Windows will override the bootloader and prevent ubuntu from installing.  \nI ran into an issue where I had installed Ubuntu, could see the partition, but it wouldn't boot after I had started Windows 10 once. After turning off secure boot, I ran boot-repair from a usb running ubuntu, which fixed the boot loader and WIndows hasn't overriden it again. I can also use linux without having it plugged in, which was an issue in the past installation, probably related to secure boot. (NOTE: There is an option at the top level of the UEFI menu to turn secure boot off and revert to legacy bios, do not choose this option.  There is another menu where you can configure these independently of each other.)\n\nA: If this is the laptop you are talking about, I have the same one.

The 20GB that you allocate are to create virtual hard drive. It's like you said \"Here virtual box, I am going to give you 20 GB hard drive, and install something there.\" \nThe installer always checks if you have enough space on disk to install the base system.

If I look at \"the linux kernel archives\" website these kernels are source code & thus require you to compile the kernal from its source. I understand this completely. And that Ubuntu has its own kernel versions which are created by Canonical and developers etc. i.e. not the same.\nHowever, the confusion I have is that many websites related to Linux & Ubuntu say its completely safe to install a kernel version which are tagged/labled as \"unstable\" surely this is wrong?\nI have only downloaded & installed the stable version numbered kernels for ubuntu. My experience has been a stable system & have never had any problems. I just dont understand why so many people & websites are encouraging users to install mainstream/unstable kernels surely this is asking for trouble? or have I miss understood something here technically speak?\n\nA: \nsay its completely safe to install a kernel version which are tagged/labled as \"unstable\" surely this is wrong?\n\nNo, it is correct. \nA new kernel (tested, untested, stable or unstable) is added to the currently installed kernels and each of them get a separate starting option in the GRUB menu. So if the kernel does not work you reboot and pick another one. All these kernels are kept separate from each other so they do not interfere with another kernel.\nThe only time you would run into trouble will be when you delete all the kernels except the newly installed one and then try to boot with only that kernel available. Nobody is going to do that, it would fall in the \"well you asked for this to happen\"-category.\n\nA: As far as I understand from reading LPIC-2 book sample , the \"stable\" vs \"unstable\" are canonical models since before 2.6 kernel version; unstable means that it contains experimental code for bug fixes or whatever else developers may be testing. In other words \"It works,but there's stuff that might not work\". \"stable\" means polished kernel that works in 90% of the cases.\nSo this is not really \"asking for trouble\", but rather an invitation to try out newer, more experimental kernel that may have bugs fixed , and who doesn't like when their bug is fixed ?\n", "Q: How to boot Ubuntu physical partition via VirtualBox on Windows I have a dual-boot setup: Windows 10 & Ubuntu 15.04.

NTFS is used for windows partitions. You can also install Linux alongsode Windows and use the windows boot manager if it will save any troublr. You need to delete the efi folder in your drive and reinstall once your done installing all operating systems. You shouldn't have to repartition. Also if you're having trouble with partitions, DOS command has a partitioning utility. You simply must use DOS strings and set the portion by KB integers from 0 to say 256000 in order.

If I switch back to Chrome as default browser (via default apps) it happens again.\nI noticed that both in Unity Launcher and from the default app settings, Chrome isn't called just 'Google Chome' but 'New Tab - Google Chrome'. Not sure if this is related or how to fix it.

I just installed Kubuntu 15.10 \"Wily Werewolf\" and found that it seems to be missing KNode. \nA Google search turned up the page http://packages.ubuntu.com/en/wily/knode and there is information about the package in Google's cache of this page, but the link now 404s.\nIn Kontact, there is no option for \"Usenet\", as it used to be in previous versions of Kubuntu.\nWhy has KNode been removed from Kubuntu and how can I get it back?

For that I have to enable \nmedia.fragmented-mp4.exposed=true\nmedia.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled=true\nmedia.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled=true\nmedia.mediasource.enabled=true\n\nAfter that it goes to error.\nI have also tested this w3schools video which also does not work. So it have something do with mp4, since HTML5 vp9  works just fine.\nubuntu-restricted etc. all installed (else youtube.com/html5 would give an error anyway.)\nTried googling, no result.\n\nA: This fixed it for me:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n\nA: I assumed that the Cisco H.264 codec is enabled and active after it is downloaded, yet you showed me that there are settings in Firefox that disable it by default (media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled;false). So the plug-in gets downloaded automatically and is active but probably never used. Very insightful, thank you.\nI did some research on my own in the past and used Vimeo without editing entries in about:config. To make Vimeo work I came to the conclusion that you only need to install gstreamer1.0-libav. As far as I know the Vimeo player doesn't provide technical information about content and by default seems to serve 720p H.264 with the HD option enabled.\nNow that I know that I can selectively disable WebM and H.264 in about:config and and verify settings on YouTube's HTML5 page I can do some more tests. I currently only have mobile Internet access on my laptop and I'm only getting 720p as the highest option on YouTube. I will check later when I'm back home (I remember having the 1080p option on my Ubuntu machines without using Flash and without errors).\nOkay 1080p playback on YouTube works for me on 14.04 and 15.10. I checked by disabling configuration options for the other codec and checking on the HTML5 player page that they have been disabled. As long as YouTube doesn't stumble over inconsistencies by modifying to much without restarting Firefox everything works fine.\nI posted more information in an answer to a very similar question: yt won't work after the ubuntu upgrade\n\nA: Works now with firefox 43.

I switched from PC to Ubuntu and had run iTunes in the past.\nI have a lot of music that I have the CDs for but I loaded them into the system one by one.\nThe problem is that although the files still exist they have been named something useless such as 'AVHB', 'GCDF' or whatever.  I can play the files in Rhythmbox and on my android phone and the correct name comes up but the FILE name is not an accuarte descriptor of the file.\nSo my question is: How do I create a script with python or whatever to run these files through the CODEC and properly rename the files?  The players have the conversions I just don't seem to be able to jump the gap.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can use id3ren which is a ID3Tag file renamer.

This should work as well with .m4a files.\nsudo apt-get install id3ren\n\nTo use it, go to the folder where your music is, preferably into an actual folder where you have music that you want renamed.  Then you can rename using a template that is offered by id3ren.  Template options are as follows:\n   -template=TEMPLATE\n          Use TEMPLATE as the basis for renaming files.  The default tem‐\n          plate used is '[%a]-[%s].mp3'.

What solved the problem was disabling Predictable Network Interface Names as descripbed here: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/ \nby running this command:\nln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-setup-link.rules\n\n\nA: My solution to this was to create a file /etc/udev/rules.d/10-rename-network.rules with the content:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", ATTR{address}==\"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\n\nA: This worked for me on 16.04 server as eno1 was showing when I did ifconfig -a.  I had to bring up the interface as ifconfig eno1 up then I did the following:\nvi /etc/udev/rules.d/10-network.rules\n\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", ATTR{address}==\"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and adding files to /etc/udev/rules.d/ did not help. The issue seems to be in the use of Predictable Network Interface Names as described here. To create your own manual naming scheme, i.e., to name your device \"eth0\" for MATLAB, you can create your own .link files in /etc/systemd/network/ as described here.\nSpecifically, I created a file /etc/systemd/network/10-eth.link with the contents\n[Match]\nMACAddress=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n[Link]\nName=eth0\n\nreplacing ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff with the MAC address of the device I wanted to change. After reboot the name was as desired.\n", "Q: Unity is broken I am having some issues getting unity to work.

If so, it's NOT mounted at boot time. Try placong your credentials= files on some directory that IS available at boot time.\n\nA: This seems to apply to NFS as well as Samba. A bug has been logged for  NFS shares and I'm seeing the same behaviour with either type.\n\nA: You might try the gigolo package using Synaptic or \"Software Manager\" (or just use the command sudo apt install gigolo on your Debian based distro.) It's nice if you don't want to do manual scripting (more MS windows OS like). If you have it auto connect and startup on your profile it feels more like saved network places in MS Windows OS's.

I had to do this:\nimport alsaaudio\nm = alsaaudio.Mixer(alsaaudio.mixers[0]) # alsaaudio.mixers = [\"PCM\"] for me.\nm.setvolume(90) # Or whatever\n\nIt may be due to my weird / broken .asoundrc config file. But given that there is no actual reference documentation for .asoundrc - just some random examples - I don't think you can blame me.\nAlso please don't call out to command line programs to do it.

Change the input to raw_input for Python 2.  \n\nTo increase by 10% when the script is run you can do one of two things.\nYou can use the alsaaudio module.\nFirst, install with\nsudo apt-get install python-alsaaudio\n\nand then import it:\nimport alsaaudio\n\nwe can get the volume:\n>>> m = alsaaudio.Mixer()\n>>> vol = m.getvolume()\n>>> vol\n[50L]\n\nwe can also set the volume:\n>>> m.setvolume(20)\n>>> vol = m.getvolume()\n>>> vol\n[20L]\n\nThis number is a long integer in a list. So to make it into a usable number, we can do int(vol[0]).\nSo to increase by 10% when it is run?\nimport alsaaudio\nm = alsaaudio.Mixer()\nvol = m.getvolume()\nvol = int(vol[0])\n\nnewVol = vol + 10\nm.setvolume(newVol)\n\n\nOr we can stick with the subprocess module and default Ubuntu commands:\nfrom subprocess import call\ncall([\"amixer\", \"-D\", \"pulse\", \"sset\", \"Master\", \"10%+\"])\n\nwill increase by 10%.\nMy pronouns are He / Him\n", "Q: ubuntu vs windows adobe products Considering ditching windows 10 altogether.. \nBut one of my main concerns is losing adobe acrobat. \nWhat is the best free and paid pdf editors for ubuntu?\nNeed to be able text.\nAlso is there anything that can compete with photoshop?\n\nA: The link above has a suggestion for PDF editors.\nI used photoshop for years.

This week a new attack on the Network Time Protocol Daemon (ntpd) was demonstrated, see this paper. This could potentially wreak havoc with my HTTPS website or other time sensitive services I am running.\nAccording to the article, to remain safe, clients and servers alike should run at least NTP version 4.2.8p4.\nRunning ntpd --version on my Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS machine gives me ntpd 4.2.6p5 which is still vulnerable. This is even after running apt-get update, apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade.\nApparently I can download the latest version from ntp.org myself. But I am unsure if this will conflict with my existing ntpd install done via apt-get. Also they only offer the download via HTTP and their method of ensuring authenticity is by using an MD5 hash checksum... I am looking forward to my NSA backdoored patch. I really wish people would use GPG signatures.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Ubuntu plan to release a security patch to upgrade ntpd to 4.2.8p4 any time soon? What will be needed to get the fix?\n\n*If I read the code and assumed the 4.2.8p4 version available for download on the ntp.org website was trustworthy, how can I install that without conflicts?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install checkinstall, read man checkinstall and use checkinstall to keep track of the files installed.\n\n*Download, build and install the version of ntpd that you need, overwriting Ubuntu's. Check to see that you can make uninstall (by reading Makefile), or keep track of the files installed.  \n\n*When Ubuntu updates ntpd to, or beyond, the desired version, return to the source directory and make uninstall. Then sudo apt-get install --reinstall ntpd should get you re-synchronized with the official version.  \nNote: I have not tried this, so I may be wrong. \n", "Q: dell inspiron 1300 installed now no internet I installed Ubuntu on an old dell 1300, but the wireless isn't working on it.

One of the first things I did was install gnome-shell, and switch from lightdm to gdm. However, when I restarted, after an initial purple Ubuntu load screen, I got a grey/black screen that never went away. I switched back to lightdm and everything worked fine again. Is this a problem with gdm in 15.10, or is there something I am not doing/doing wrong? Thank you! \nUpdate:\nI have been following this bug report: bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/1500673 originally linked below by @ulkeshkosh, and there is some new activity there including a suggested fix that worked for one user. I tried this fix, and it didn't work for me, nor did it work for the other commenters, but it might work for someone else visiting this post. \nHowever,  a word of warning: one commenter mentions this line in /etc/gdm/custom.conf:\n[daemon]\n # Uncomment the line below to force the login screen to use Xorg\n #WaylandEnable = false\nthe commenter does not suggest modifying this line in any way, but being an inexperienced and curious Linux user, I decided to see what happens when I uncommented it, and the results were quite a pain to recover from, so I would suggest that you not experiment in this way.\n\nA: I finally got gdm to work properly. Initially I had just installed gnome-shell, which allowed me to use the GNOME desktop environment, but didn't allow me to use gdm with it, as described above, which causes certain other problems, like being unable to lock for example, and other issues mentioned in the comments to the question. \nThe solution was to install ubuntu-gnome-desktop:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nAfter that, I changed my display manager back to gdm with: \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nand after restarting I was greeted with the appropriate login screen, and everything has worked smoothly so far. \nI am assuming this fix worked because of either some extra dependencies that were needed, or some extra tweaks that were made to configuration files when installing that package. I don't have quite enough experience with LInux yet to understand why this worked, but it did, and hopefully it will too for others that have had this problem.\nUpdate:\nI cannot confirm whether this works or not because I have not tried it, but user @detly suggests in the comments below that 17.04 users should use gdm3 instead of gdm.

So my easiest option was to take backup and entirely delete the previous OS (Win 10 in this case) and install Ubuntu 15.10. All went great until the fatal error popped up.\nBootloader install failed .. and then it askes me \"how would you like to proceed?\" Giving me three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*choose a different device to install the boot loader .. between /dev/sda ATA WDC WD7500BPVT-2 (750.2 GB) and /dev/sda1 and then not continuing when I click on OK.\n\n*continue without a boot loader .. saying that I will need to manually install a boot loader in order to start Ubuntu. Then again not proceeding when I click on OK\n\n*cancel the installation.. Saying that this may leave my computer unable to boot.\nThen again not proceeding as I click on OK.\nWhat should I do in this case?\n\nA: I faced a similar problem (see screenshot) - Installation with Internet connection solved it.\n\n\nA: I have faced the same issue. In my case the problem was that I was trying to install Ubuntu in no-UEFI mode, alongside WIN10 which is installed in EUFI mode (most recent BIOS replacing MBR).\nSo my solution was:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new bootable USB with my Ubuntu distro (15.10) using\nRufus utility, supporting EUFI partition scheme - meaning that \nit will allow you to install Windows or Linux OS in full EFI mode\n\n*entered the BIOS with following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure boot [disabled] \n\n*Fast Boot [disabled]\n\n*set CSM compatibility back as [disabled] - some posts suggest to enable but I think it is not needed when installing in full EFI mode \n\n\n*In BIOS look for override boot options (in my case under Save & Exit tab > Override boot) there I could see my USB key as \"UEFI: SanDisk...\". I selected it and this started the Ubuntu installer and everything went smoothly.\n\nA: I had the same problem - the boot install failure and dialogue that wouldn't close. I had this when installing from a live-usb session. Restarting from the boot menu's install option worked for me.\n\nA: I had exactly this same problem.  But specifically, I was installing to an internal SSD with two partitions: one for all of linux (root or \"/\") and the other for \"AllMyData\". (I do have a hdd, but use it as a backup for my network)  \nWhen I first tried to install Ubuntu I used the option to reinstall Xubuntu (over the existing 15.10 - because I'm having some Python issues), but it resulted in the same error at described in the question.  I then tried installing it beside the existing OS - but that also resulted in an error.  I then tried to replace the existing OS -- same error.\nI then found this question (that described exactly my problem), and I tried all of the suggestions mention:\n1) I did a checksum and it was not a corrupted iso.\n2) There is no reason why the sdb (SSD) should not work, as I've used it before and checked that it is working properly.\n3) The other issue re: Install with an Internet Connection -- well, I had an internet connection.\nNone of the suggestions (answers) worked for me.\nThe only option that worked for me was, when asked for the kind of installation, to select \"Other Installation\".  But be warned you need to know how to work with partitions, or take some time to read up on using Gparted and setting up Linux. (I can add links if it is needed, but a simple search on AskUbuntu should find info regarding this.)  The bootloader and all of Ubuntu loaded without any errors -- as per my setup in the \"Other Installation\" -- for me, I installed grub on sdb (not sdb1 or sdbx).  I would suggest that this is an Ubuntu bug, and found some reference to problems installing to USB, but at this point in time I'm fine with using the option that worked for me.\n\nA: I had this same problem trying a fresh install of Ubuntu Mate 17.10 on a new HDD in a desktop PC. I tried many of the answers in this thread and from here. Custom partition setup works fine but if you want to use guided partitioning, this answer from SuperUser.com solved the problem for me. Quote:\n\nI finally got rid of the error. And to be honest, it's stupid.\nThe problem actually was, that the /boot partition wasn't created,\n  even though it was shown in the UI. It's still possible to get\n  everything running with the guided partitioning, but when you're asked\n  to Write the changes to the disk?, you need to go <Back> to see a\n  detailed list of all partitions. When clicking <Next>, the\n  installation will finally recognise and partition everything correctly\n  and as expected.\n\n\nA: \n\nInstall it on /dev/sda -- Raphael\n\n@Raphael i am trying but no matter how many times i try to click on ok it doesn't react in anyway !!\n\nThere probably is nothing to click because it is a TUI interface (1, 2). Use the arrow keys, space and return/enter.\n\nA: Seems like something is corrupted.\nIf the OK button is not getting pressed at all, then it just might be that you have a broken ISO.\nTry redownloading. As a side note, I would wipe the MBR. (note that this deletes your partition tables and would render your PC unbootable until you install a new OS.)\nNote that if you proceed without installing grub(bootloader), you cannot boot into your ubuntu installation. You will have to configure grub later on.\n\nA: I found the problem, the installer is looking for a decompression command that some systems SSE does not have which prevents the boot loader archive from being found and opened when the USB boot drive is made in ISO mode.\nMy solution is to get Rufus 2.8.886 bootable usb maker (it's free) and run through the usual configure, however when you select your linux ISO file, choose in Rufus the \"DD\" mode which in layman's terms means to simulate a HDD so that the computer and installer don't get confused but partitions and file types. Don't worry if you can't see the prepared DD type USB drive in windows file explorer, you will only see a couple .EFI files. Just boot off the USB drive as usual and it will properly install the bootloader. \n\nA: I ran into this same problem when installing Lubuntu 16 on a rather old Laptop (HP Compaq CQ85): Exactly this crash after 50% progress when trying to install grub.\nI only wanted Linux to run, no Windows in parallel. My assumption is that the installer starts from USB in non-EFI mode but then tries to install an EFI bootsystem on the harddrive. Forcing both, BIOS AND installer NOT to use EFI worked for me:\n1.)\nI created the USB installer with unetbootin (doesn't matter, actually Rufus does the same), but it was NOT the EFI style of boot media.\n2.)\nI had to allow legacy boot support in my BIOS settings and turn EFI off.\n3.)\nOn the USB drive I edit the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg by adding the word 'noefi' to the existing kernel parameters, like this: (careful with copy and paste from the next tiny window! End of line invisble!)\n    ...[section 'install ubuntu']\n    linux   /casper/vmlinuz.efi  file=/cdrom/preseed/lubuntu.seed boot=casper noefi only-ubiquity quiet splash ---\n\nThis will force the installer to create the old legacy bootloader and not an EFI boot partition.\n\nA: This type of error in most cases is nothing to do with software. The installation becomes confused when the drives are not configured correctly within the BIOS. First check the BIOS to see if the SATA drives are listed in the correct order. If not, it will require the computer to be opened up and the cable connections to be inserted in the correct motherboard locations. Given the motherboard type, the correct plugins may not always be obvious so re-check the BIOS for drive order. A correct setup would be as follows: Example SSD (to be boot drive), Sata1, TB (data drive), Sata2 and DVD Sata3. When this is completed and all drives are in the correct order, you should have no problem installing your OS. \n\nA: Even I faced the same error while installing the linux for 64 bit in Oracle VM Virtual Box.\nSolution that worked for me :\n\nFirst Create the virtual Device and before starting the ubuntu system go to \nSettings of Oracle VM ->System->Processor->Make Processor(s) to 2 CPUs and click OK then start the ubuntu system.\nAlso I did't checked the LVM Partition Option \nTry it If it works for you.\n\nA: I had the same problem installing Mate 20.04 LTS on a HP Z800, after successfully installing it on NVME Boot drives (Samsung 970 EVO+ in PCIe adapter) on two HP Z440s.\nSomewhere I saw a post suggesting that the bug happens when there's more than a single drive and the first one \"seen\" by the ubuntu installer isn't the one where you want the loader.  This Z800 has a LSI 9260-8i Megaraid PCIe card supporting 5 HDDs configured as two virtual drives (usually it runs Win 10) and they come up ahead of anything plugged into the on-board SATA ports. I unplugged the drives connected to the 9261 so that the intended boot drive was the only game in town.  Install was then fine.  Plugged the drives back in, and they're fine too.  Thus I can endorse this solution.\n\nA: You also encounter this issue when attempting to install Ubuntu 20.04 / Mint 20 on a LUKS encrypted volume or LVM on LUKS if you've created this encrypted volume manually before starting the installation and not using the wizard.\nThe solution is to enabled encryption support in GRUB i.e. create a file /target/etc/default/grub.d/local.cfg with the contents GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y before the installer attempts to install the bootloader.\n", "Q: Steam won't open in Ubuntu 15.10 Been trying over and over, but nothing happens.

This will take a lonnnnnnng time!\nUPDATE:\nIf you use 16.10, the guys from Ubuntu provided a modified installer that takes care of this issues.

The problem is that the login screen is gone. It's just a black screen. Have reinstalled graphics drivers (fglrx and nvidia-355), lightdm, gvm but same situation. How can I find out if my graphics driver is happy? No clues in dmesg. I used to run gnome classic before the upgrade. Nvidia GT640.\n\nA: Well, sort of solved. Here's what I did:\n1. reinstall nvidia-355 driver and let it run to completion. Takes a while. This made it possible to do \"startx\", so the login window was now visible, but I was in a login loop, couldn't get in.\n2. Install Mate desktop. (not sure that was relevant)\n3. Unistall Plymouth. This prompted a whole new packages to be installed, but I said yes. A script asked if I wanted to use gdm, lightdm or something new called ssdm. I chose ssdm.\nFinally! a new login screen allowed me to select a number of desktop systems, such as gnome, plasma, metacity, failsafe... and mate. If I choose mate (the last installed) I can login (YES!) but for all other choices I end up in the loop. Hope this helps someone.\n", "Q: What is the difference between OpenJDK and Oracle JDK? I was building Android apps on Android Studio when it asked me to remove OpenJDK and install Oracle JDK. Now, I was using OpenJDK for building Cyanogenmod.\nIf I wipe off OpenJDK and install Oracle JDK, would CM builds break?\n\nA: Look at this answer to understand the key differences between OpenJDK and Oracle JDK.\nIf you want to use Oracle Java, you have to install it as Paranoid Panda has suggested. Then you have to set your Java environment variables by adding  the following two lines to ~/.bashrc\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nIf you want, you could also uninstall OpenJDK from your machine at all.

What  are  the  key  differences \nbetween them? What are the similarities between them ? \n\nA: NTFS\nNT file system, NTFS, is designed to quickly perform standard file operations such as read, write, search,and even advanced operations such as file-system recovery on very large hard disks.\nFormatting a volume with the NTFS file system results in the creation of several system files such as $MFT, Master File Table, $Bitmap, $LogFile and others.\nThe first information on an NTFS volume is the Partition Boot Sector ($Boot metadata file), which starts at sector 0 and can be up to 16 sectors long. \nEncryption:\nThe Encrypting File System (EFS) provides the core file encryption technology used to store encrypted files on NTFS volumes. \nDisk Quotas:\nWindows 2000 supports disk quotas for NTFS volumes. \nReparse Points:\nReparse points are new file system objects in NTFS that can be applied to NTFS files or folders. \nVolume Mount Points:\nVolume mount points based on reparse points, volume mount points allow administrators to graft access to the root of one local volume onto the folder structure of another local volume.\nSparse Files:\nSparse files allow programs to create very large files but consume disk space only as needed.\nDistributed Link Tracking:\nNTFS provides a link-tracking service that maintains the integrity of shortcuts to files as well as OLE links within compound documents.\nEXT4\nExt4 is the evolution of the most used Linux filesystem, Ext3. The result is a filesystem with an improved design, better performance, reliability and features.\nBigger filesystem/file sizes:\nExt4 adds 48-bit block addressing, so it will have 1 EB of maximum filesystem size and 16 TB of maximum file size. 1 EB = 1,048,576 TB.  Why 48-bit and not 64-bit? There are some limitations that would need to be fixed before making Ext4 fully 64-bit capable, which have not been addressed in Ext4. The Ext4 data structures have been designed keeping this in mind, so a future update to Ext4 will implement full 64-bit support at some point. \nSub directory scalability:\nExt4 breaks that limit and allows an unlimited number of sub directories.\nExtents:\nAn extent is basically a bunch of contiguous physical blocks. It basically says \"The data is in the next n blocks\". For example, a 100 MB file can be allocated into a single extent of that size, instead of needing to create the indirect mapping for 25600 blocks (4 KB per block). Huge files are split in several extents. Extents improve the performance and also help to reduce the fragmentation, since an extent encourages continuous layouts on the disk.\nMultiblock allocation\nExt4 uses a \"multiblock allocator\" (mballoc) which allocates many blocks in a single call, instead of a single block per call, avoiding a lot of overhead. This improves the performance, and it's particularly useful with delayed allocation and extents. \nDelayed allocation:\nDelayed allocation is a performance feature  and it consists in delaying the allocation of blocks as much as possible, contrary to what traditionally filesystems do: allocate the blocks as soon as possible. For example, if a process write()s, the filesystem code will allocate immediately the blocks where the data will be placed - even if the data is not being written right now to the disk and it's going to be kept in the cache for some time. \nFast fsck\nFsck is a very slow operation, especially the first step: checking all the inodes in the file system. In Ext4, at the end of each group's inode table will be stored a list of unused inodes (with a checksum, for safety), so fsck will not check those inodes. The result is that total fsck time improves from 2 to 20 times, depending on the number of used inodes.\nJournal checksumming\nThe journal is the most used part of the disk, making the blocks that form part of it more prone to hardware failure. And recovering from a corrupted journal can lead to massive corruption. Ext4 checksums the journal data to know if the journal blocks are failing or corrupted. \nOnline defragmentation\nWhile delayed allocation, extents and multiblock allocation help to reduce the fragmentation, with usage filesystems can still fragment. Ext4 will support online fragmentation, and there's a e4defrag tool which can defragment individual files or the whole filesystem.\nInode-related features:\nLarger inodes, nanosecond timestamps, fast extended attributes, inodes reservation.\n    Ext4 will default to 256 bytes. This is needed to accommodate some extra fields, and the remaining space of the inode will be used to store extend attributes that are small enough to fit it that space. \n    Inode reservation consists in reserving several inodes when a directory is created, expecting that they will be used in the future. \n    Nanoseconds timestamps means that inode fields like \"modified time\" will be able to use nanosecond resolution.\nPersistent preallocation\nThis feature, available in Ext3 in the latest kernel versions, and emulated by glibc in the filesystems that don't support it, allows applications to preallocate disk space: Applications tell the filesystem to preallocate the space, and the filesystem preallocates the necessary blocks and data structures, but there's no data on it until the application really needs to write the data in the future. \nBarriers on by default:\nThis is an option that improves the integrity of the filesystem at the cost of some performance (you can disable it with \"mount -o barrier=0\", recommended trying it if you're benchmarking). \nNTFS Source\nEXT4 Source\n", "Q: How to transfer files from windows to Linux I have a computer on which both Linux and windows are present.\nI installed Linux because the computer wasn't working on windows. \nHowever, when I installed Linux none of the files were transferred from windows to Linux although during installation it suggested otherwise. \nSo, I want to know how to transfer the files from windows to Linux. \n\nA: Your windows files will be on a separate drive or partition.\nYou should see this drive/partition under the device section of your file browser.

You say it's an old PC and using iGPU of E7400.\nI'd suggest - now that 15.10 is out - that you try with ubuntu 15.04 or 15.10.

Then vgextend to add that volume to the volume group, and finally you can use lvconvert to convert your existing logical volumes to raid0, which will stripe them between the two drives.  You probably will also want to use lvextend to increase the size of the logical volume, and resize2fs to expand the filesystem on it to use the additional space.\n", "Q: How can I run a command at the background without ampersand (&)?

Also odd: Why does it refer to port 1024 instead of 22?\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You are connecting to the Ubuntu machine, not your mac, so you need to use your Ubuntu's user name instead. The message means that you are attempting to log in as macuser (or whatever your username is) and there is no macuser on the Ubuntu machine. So, assuming you log in to Ubuntu as ubuntuuser, try:\nssh ubuntuuser@1.2.3.4\n\nAlso, there's no need to specify port 22, that's the default. You also don't need to forward port 22 to the Ubuntu machine, not unless you want to connect from outside your local network. As for the 1024 port, ignore it, that is the source port of the connecting client (your mac), not the target port of your Ubuntu machine. \n\nA: You need to specify remote user (from previous question):\nssh -p 22 -l me [ubuntu ip address]\n\nSSH uses as default the user who is currently logged in and it is obviously different on the other machine. You can also skip the port, since it is default and use it like this:\nssh me@[ubuntu ip address]\n\n\nAlso odd: why does it refer to port 1024 instead of 22?

I'm trying to make it boot to Ubuntu from a USB flash drive. \nMy main computer is a Mac, and I tried to make the USB drive bootable in Ubuntu via the Mac, but I couldn't figure it out. \nSo now I installed Virtual Box and installed Ubuntu on to the VM there. Is it possible to using the VM Ubuntu make my flashdrive bootable in Ubuntu? \nThanks so much! \n\nA: For that you will need to enable USB in Virtualbox: How to set up USB for Virtualbox?\nThen you can install Multisystem in Ubuntu in Virtualbox to your flash drive and choose the linux distribution you want to install.\nNote: The Virtualbox uses USB2 drivers where your computer might have only USB3. This must not be compatible 100%, but you can still try it.\n\nA: You are looking for unetbootin for the Mac OS. You can do this in Ubuntu via your VM but that's not really required. This is pretty easy to do, just go download the Mac OS file and run it. You can get that here - it's the one in the upper right. I won't link to the direct download because that may change in the future.\nFormat your USB to FAT32 using your standard tools. Then run unetbootin that you downloaded above. You point it to the .ISO that you previously downloaded or you can have it download automatically. When done, simply click exit (not reboot - unless you want to reboot, that is) and place the USB stick into the old laptop.\nDuring the old laptop's boot cycle, during the POST (Power On Self Test) there will be an option to change your boot device. This is often F12 but varies with laptop manufacturers. If this is not an option then simply enter your BIOS (Basic Input Output Settings - sometimes called System Settings) and change the boot order to move the USB device to the top. If you don't have the ability (some old laptops do not) to boot to USB then you'll want to burn the ISO as a DVD (as an image, not a direct copy) and then select to boot to DVD in the boot menu or via changing BIOS settings.\n", "Q: Only able to get wired internet connection when running 14.04 from disc, not when installed After re-installing 14.04 on my Dell Inspiron 1520 laptop I found that I could no longer get a wired internet connection.

I know that Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS comes with five years of security and maintenance updates, guaranteed, and that 15.10 only had nine months of support.\nWhy would you chose 15.10 if it will be unsupported soon? What are the benefits of 15.10?\n\nA: LTS is long term support - as you say it has 5 years of updates and will have reached 14.04.5 by the time it is end of life.\nHowever, because the developers are focusing on stability and reliability (especially for business users who rely on their networks working), they don't add masses of features. Early on their is a feature freeze and they make sure there are no bugs.\nThis means that Ubuntu 14.04 is less cutting edge - both because it was released in April 2014, 1.5 years ago, and because it was never intended to be chock full of features.\n\nUbuntu 15.10 on the other hand has had new features added to it, including the following:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Unity polish and fixes\n  \n*Steam controller support\n  \n*New scrollbars Linux\n  \n*Kernel 4.2 Updated apps, including LibreOffice 5\n  \n*Ubuntu Make update\n  \n*Python 3.5 Support\n  \n\nBut this will only be supported for the next 9 months. Why? In 6 months there will be another release - 16.04 (an LTS release, incidentally), which you will be able to update to.\nUpdating every 6 months is a hassle - but that's the price you pay for latest features.\n\nSo which is better depends on what you need. If you want the latest features - and don't mind 6 monthly updates then go for the latest release.\nIf you want to know that you will have a system that works and is secure for the next 5 years then go for 14.04 (what I have)\nIf you are planning to update to 16.04 when it's released, you may as well get 15.10. But from there it's your choice to update to 16.10 if you want the latest features, or stay at 16.04 for stability and support.\n\nAlso note that here on Ask Ubuntu, we only offer answers to Ubuntu version that are currently supported - another reason to stay with a version that is current. If you are worried you won't want to update that frequently, it's better to get an LTS release - then there is no danger of it not being updated.\n\nA: Generally it is recommended to use the Ubuntu Long Term Support version which is very stable.\nUbuntu 14.04.03 is well tested and as you already said supported for a time frame of five years.\nIf you are a more experienced user you can consider to install the final version of Ubuntu 15.10.\nIt is also stable and the main advantage is, that it brings along more current software packages.\n\nA: LTS releases are designed to be stable platforms that you can stick with for a long time and they are designed to be more polished, while the standard releases bring you the latest features that may not be completely finished yet. Upgrading to the latest releases will give you the latest versions of software.\nIf you want to have the latest versions of all your software, and use the latest features before they make it to the LTS version of Ubuntu you should upgrade to the latest release. \n\nA: Better is kind of subjective.  The newer version can provide support for newer hardware and will provide newer version of applications.\nHowever if you download 14.04.3 it will include the newer kernels and graphic stacks, which is where most of the hardware support comes from.\nYou may be stuck with older versions of some software but many will update to the newer version in the backport software sources.  Many others will have a ppas you can add to use newer versions of software than is included in the standard repositories.\nIf you need more info about how to add ppas or enable the backports source, there are plenty of great answers here on how to do that so there is no need for me to go into it.\nIn short, there will be very little difference between the newest version and the HWE version of 14.04.  If you have a new computer with all of the newest hardware you might find it works better but otherwise it should not matter.\nHWE stands for Hardware Ennoblement Stack.  The first version of any LTS will only keep the same kernel and graphic stack version(it will still be updated but never a new version).  This is done so that corporation and non power-users don't risk newer kernels breaking stuff(it is rare but it happens).  After the next non-LTS version is released the LTS version is updated to the newer kernels so that you can stay updated and possibly get better performance if you wish to accept the minor risk of having to fix a bug that breaks you system.\n\nA: Using the latest version has the advantage that you get newer version of all the packages installed on your system. Many desktop users choose to go with the newest version for this reason. The disadvantage is that you'll be forced to do dist upgrades every 6 months, and things can break when you do that. Things can also break when individual packages are upgraded. \nIn contrast, LTS is supported for 5 years and has an emphasis on stability. Major components such as the kernel and graphics drivers still receive updates, and all packages receive security updates. The advantage is that things are very stable and it is unlikely that things will stop working once you configure them. The disadvantage is that some of the software is old version (more than a few years old). Firefox is one of the packages that is backported by default (so that you get a new version), but most software is not backported. If you want newer version of software, you'll either have to compile it yourself or install a backport from a ppa.\nPersonally I use LTS because bumblebee-nvidia has a tendency to break with frequent upgrades. As I mentioned, firefox is backported so it's already the latest version. I used custom ppas to install backports of the latest versions of LibreOffice and KiCad. I also compiled my own version of xfwm4 so it would include the titleless maximize option. \n\nA: It's your opinion. If you have a slower computer that might not be able to keep supporting newer systems, I would go with 14.04.3, like mine. But if you have a faster computer that can hold up with more updates, going to 15.10 and keep updating might be best, as you can keep more updated. But like I said, it is your opinion.\n", "Q: Elan Touchpad not working in 15.10 I installed Ubuntu 15.04 and then upgraded to Ubuntu 15.10 on my laptop (Fujitsu U745).

Originally, on my Debian operating system, I had installed mdadm and had a spanned array of 5 drives appearing as /dev/md0 (none of these had the MBR on them, it was just a new bunch of drives used only for the array). I then mounted /mnt/raiddrvies onto /dev/md0 to access the content. Now the problem is this. Since I've put Ubuntu server onto that SSD, how do I now restore the raid array? I've installed mdadm and tried to run the following command:\nsudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=linear --raid-devices=5 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdd /dev/sde /dev/sdf\n\nWhen it goes to create the drive, it says the following message for each of the /dev/sd(a,b,d,e, or f):\nmdadm: partition table exists on /dev/sda but will be lost or meaningless after creating array\n\nAt the end it asks:\nContinue creating an array?\n\nI've put no because I want to keep the original array.

It also means that if you lose even one of those drives, all of your data is gone.\nhttps://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID_setup#Linear_mode \n\"Ok, so you have two or more partitions (emphasis mine) which are not necessarily the same size (but of course can be), which you want to append to each other.\nSpare-disks are not supported here. If a disk dies, the array dies with it. ...\"\n", "Q: Grub rescue on USB I made the mistake to install Ubuntu on my USB. After some time I wanted to use it normally again (also the OS was really slow) so I formatted it. The problem is, I burned a Windows 10 ISO to it and tried to boot from it but I get the following message: \"Unknown filesystem: grub rescue>\" , meaning Ubuntu was not completely removed with the format.How do I format the USB correctly so that this message doesn't display?\n\nA: To completely wipe the drive, I would create a new partition table.\nIf you can use Ubuntu, follow these steps to create a new partition table:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gparted. GParted is a great graphical partition management tool. You can install it from a terminal using: sudo apt-get install gparted, or by searching for it in the Ubunutu Software Center.\n\n*Open gparted by searching for it in the dash or from a terminal with the command gparted. You will be prompted for your password.\n\n*Select the correct drive. Open the dropdown (usually it reads /dev/sda), and select the drive you want to format. Verify that you are working with the correct drive by looking at its capacity. Be careful!\n\n*Generate a new partition table. Once you are sure you have selected the right drive, select Device, and then Create partition table... (this might not be exact, as for me it is written in a different language). Then you will be prompted to select the type of partition table you want to create. Generally, I would use gpt, but for USB-drives msdos is also fine. Note that msdos only supports a maximum of 4 partitions and that gpt only works on 64-bit computers.\n\n*Create a new partition. If you want to create a partition now, right-click on the empty space, and select new. Configure its size and type (FAT32 should do in your case) and press Add.\n\n\nThis procedure can also be completed in Windows.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu on UEFI system after deleting EFI partition I have a Lenovo G580(20157) laptop that didn't come with any preinstalled OS. I used win 7 until now and gradually upgraded to windows 8 and then to win 10. I also updated my bios drivers. My bios is phoenix secure.\nI then wanted to install Ubuntu to replace Windows because I am just sick of it. This is when I encountered the UEFI issue.\nI couldn't boot to livecd (either on a bootable disc or bootable USB). \nThen I switched off Secure boot. And yet it couldn't boot into live cd (Windows bootable disks work). I even tried removing the hard disk to see whether I could access the boot menu, but no such luck.\nThe crux of the matter is that I can only get to the boot menu on pressing F12 just before booting. I can't see the UEFI settings in that menu. I heard that F2 should open any such menu, but after hundreds of tries, I couldn't get it.\nNow I feel that the EFI partition is the culprit and so wish to delete it and then boot via livecd and then install ubuntu. I have backed up my data , just in case. But I am hesitant about this. \nWill deleting the EFI partition help me boot into livecd? Please help me. Please excuse my abrupt and confused problem description without any images. Will post more information if required?\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that my laptop is 64-bit and that I was trying to install a 32-bit version\n\nA: I couldn't get to the unetbootin (or whatever boot disc creator you use) splash screen in order to choose the: try ubuntu, install ubuntu now, etc. on my Lenovo B570 Laptop until I did this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format USB to fat32. \n\n*Create bootable Ubuntu USB with unetbootin, but don't reboot at this point.\n\n*Open the USB drive and delete the EFI folder.\n\n*Now reboot to do install. \n\n\nIf you selected USB drive as first boot device in your bios earlier, you shouldn't have to use F12, F2, or delete, you should get the unetbootin splash screen and select, Try Ubuntu, Install Ubuntu, etc...\n Before this process I had to use the F12 as you said but I would always get boot errors (can't remember what). The EFI folder was causing the trouble for me.   \n\nA: I finally used Rufus to solve my problem. I tried it before, but it couldn't create a GPT partition with UEFI settings (and other options failed to make my USB boot). This was because I was using a 32-bit OS. The moment I downloaded a 64-bit OS and used Rufus, the GPT option was enabled. \nNow, I am able to install Ubuntu without any hitches. \n", "Q: Fresh Install 14.04 Server Networking Not Working I just installed 14.04 server and the installer was able to connect to the internet to complete the install.

Wine is the \"translation layer\" that allows windows programs to run on linux. However the configuration of wine can be anything from easy to very difficult. This is where PlayOnLinux helps.\nPlayOnLinux is two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*a repository of \"recepies\" that can automatically download/install/configure windows programs.\n\n*A Wine-Container-Manager. This is what they call \"virtual drive\". \nThe recepies are there that the normal user does not need to deal with the gory details of wine configuration. The containers (virtual drives) are the killer-feature of this application, because: for each container you can define (and change) the wine version to use.\nBy default each application is installed into its own container. But you can create a container for each application you install, or you can install all your applications in a single container. \nInstall a Program\nAlthough it says \"Install a program\" it will only invoke the recepie for the selected program. Some commercial programs will require you to have the original windows- installation media (CD/DVD) ready. Generally it can only do \"the complete installation job\" if the program is open source. I don't know the status of \"The two thrones\".\nTo address your issue:\nI suggest you delete the container you've created. Then you can start over to install anything you want.

When i go into hibernation and resume then look at the result of running uptime , i note that the the hibernation duration is also included.\nin pm-hibernate man pages. it states that: \"During hibernate the system is fully powered off,\" . \nshouldn't uptime be resetting to zero if the 'the system is fully powered off' or pausing because the system is hibernated hibernated, or is this a bug?\n\nA: \nshouldn't uptime be resetting to zero if the 'the system is fully powered off' \n\n\n\n*\n\n*suspend/hibernate are not considered \"off\". The last \"wake up time\" is stored in /var/log/pm-suspend.log. \n\n\n\nor pausing because the system is hibernated\n\n\n\n*\n\n*now that would be odd. How would one then know what the actual uptime is?  \n\n\n\nor is this a bug?\n\nUptime is the time since last (re)boot. Basically the system stores at boot time what the time is and \"now\" -/- that time is the uptime. So in that regard: no, not a bug. \nThe command predates notebooks and hibernate/suspend so maybe if you create a feature request someone decides it is a good feature to have. It  probably is a very easy addition:just update the time stored on disk. And I can not imagine it is a lot more than adding a call to the hibernation/suspend script.
