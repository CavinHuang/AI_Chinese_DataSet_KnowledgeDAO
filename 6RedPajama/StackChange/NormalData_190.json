["Q: How to browse the Ubuntu Server Guide https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/ in PURE english from german computer and locale I prefer to read computer documentation in english - I have switched Firefox locale off, but still get a weird english/german mixture. I do not want to download the english pdf to this computer.\n\nA: How did you switch Firefox locale off?\nIf you in Firefox select Edit -> Preferences -> Content -> Languages and no language is selected (or English is the preferred language), the English versions of the pages should be delivered to your browser.\n\nA: Alternatively you can download the full English PDF https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/serverguide.pdf\n", "Q: \"Battery not present\" Dell Inspiron 14-7437 [Kubuntu-14.04] I'm running Kubuntu 14.04.1 LTS AMD64 on my Dell Inspiron 14\" 7437; it is a fresh and fully updated installation.\nWhat happens when I turn on my PC without the power cord attached is that KDE systray battery icon shows the battery as \"not present\" even though it certanly is; then if I try to connect the power adapter, it suddenly realizes about the battery and correctly displays its charge level, at that point I can disconnect the adapter and it will keep showing the correct info about the battery levels and everything ...\nSo, the thing is that I just can't boot my PC without connecting the power adapter but that's quite annoying when I am not home or if I have no power outlet available around me because I can't know my battery charge level...\nHow do I fix this ?\n\nA: I've looked things up a little bit more and couldn't really find the exact solution matching my problem on a Dell-Laptop but I've read of some people having similar problems with toshiba's batteries and finally found a way to get mine correctly detected. All I needed to do was add a kernel parameter at pc-startup.\nTo do this follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*type in a terminal -> sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n*locate this line -> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\n*add acpi_osi=Linux param -> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux\"\n\n*save and exit the editor\n\n*update grub -> sudo update-grub\n\n*right click the KDE system tray and check \"battery monitor\" in the additional items (you can also configure it to show on \"auto\" mode or \"always\"; auto shows it only when the pc is running on battery)\n\n*reboot\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*what acpi_osi=Linux does is telling the BIOS that the running O.S. is/will be linux, just that\n\n*step6 was needed because that item didn't get included by default since the system thought no battery was available\n\n\nConclusions:\nAdding acpi_osi=Linux to the kernel parameters perfectly fixes my battery detection problem, if you have the exact same laptop model as mine it will surely work for you too; it might also work for the other Inspirons laptops belonging to the 7000 serie as well.\nHope this answer can help.\n", "Q: Fn keys stopped working - how can I tell if it's a hardware issue? On my ubuntu 12.04 and Thinkpad T400, I used to adjust brightness by Fn+Home for more brightness or Fn+End for more darkness. But my Fn key does not work since more than a year ago, not just for adjusting brightness, but also for other things requiring Fn key.\nI suspect the Fn key doesn't work any more.\nHow can I verify if Fn key works or not?\nAny way to fix it?\nThanks.\n\nA: I have a T440s and may be its the same thing: the keyboad top row has two modes, the direct key and the \"Fn\" + key.\nYou can switch between the two modes by pressing Fn + FnLk (Esc key on my french keyboard). On my Fn key, a light indicates the mode: when the light is on, I have the F1, F2... in direct mode and I must press Fn to access the special functions like sound, brightness. When the light is off, the special keys are in direct mode and F1, F2, ... in indirect mode (ie I must press Fn to have them).\nHope this helps you.\nGiles\n", "Q: Transfering my Ubuntu install onto a replacement hard drive Today I am planning on swapping out my ridiculously small 20gb hard drive, for a less small 80gb. Only issue is that it's my Ubuntu drive and I'd rather not go through the install process again. I really have 2 separate questions here. \n\n\n*\n\n*I know that 14.10 is coming fairly soon, so I could just wait to re-install Ubuntu onto it then. If so, will a backup from 14.04 carry my installed applications and files into a 14.10 install? I've never really looked into what the backup function covers.\n\n*If option 1 doesn't work and I do have to find a way to clone the drive, how would I go about doing this? I'm out of IDE slots on my computer so I have no way of having both hard drives attached simultaneously to copy it using Clonezilla. \nIf all else fails I can just go through the process again on the new drive.  \n\nA: For question 2, I assume you have at least 2 IDE ports ... else there is no way to do your copy\nI'd put in the two drives then boot off a live CD/USB disk.\nThe safest/clearest way to then copy the partition would be using gparted.\n\nA: In response to #2:\nFirst you should back up all your important files to a separate disk.  Then, if you don't have an extra IDE port, see if you have an available SATA port. If you have a usable SATA port, I suggest you try to clone your 20GB IDE hard drive to a larger SATA hard drive.  Upon a successful clone, you should be able to boot Ubuntu 14.04 on your SATA drive and still have all your installed applications.  When Ubuntu 14.10 is available, you can use the Software Updater to upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 to Ubuntu 14.10.\n", "Q: How to handle apt-get update failing to fetch old packages *without* upgrading I'm using Ubuntu 13.04.

Even simple updates.  So, even though this is the answer to your question, it is still recommended that you upgrade to an LTS release.  \nGood luck.\n", "Q: How to access Ubuntu GUI through Teamviewer on headless server?

It's probably a 256 color palette now. The menu is:\nImage » Mode » RGB\nNote that at the time you save your image you can convert it back to a paletted image. However, you may again lose quality. Also make sure to keep a .xcf version of the file (Gimp's format) so that way you can do further edits later.\n\nA: In my case I had a file with ready text layers. And after adding a fonts.conf file and closing Gimp and reopening the file, green borders around text were still there.

When trying to solve another issue (long story) I downloaded a couple of ttf files and installed them. They look awful, so I want to go back. But now I can't find them.\nI installed font manager and it shows me lots of fonts but not actually Garamond. Libre Office shows just one Garamond, though I loaded two.\nI loaded them with font viewer.\nI looked in my ~/.fonts, /usr/local/share/fonts/, /usr/share/fonts but no Garamonds there so I don't know where LibreOffice is finding the Garamond it is showing me. It occurs to me that it might be a substituted font, provided because I have existing documents that use Garamond. I don't know how to check if this is true.\nDoes anyone know where that Garamond is actually coming from?\nUpdate: I used gedit to look at the list of fonts and found there are two fonts called Garamond. I don't know if LibreOffice is using one of those, but I expect it is. However I also don't yet know how to remove both of them and reinstall what I had before. But this doesn't now look like a LibreOffice issue, except that it is (quite reasonably) presenting just one font when there are two of the same name.\n\nA: You can find the answer to your problem in this link. You should check what is the default font that is used in case of a missing font. Then change your text to use that font. If nothing changes, it means Garamond is not installed on your machine. If it does change, then what you were seeing is Garamond.\nEdited: Thanks to muru\nApparently, Garamond font is not free. So, most probably you don't have the font on your system. Note, that the substitution is done by LibreOffice and not the Ubuntu itself.\nIn LibreOffice go to Tools > Options ..., select the section Fonts. You should be able to see what font is being used in case a font is not found.\n\nA: I've been using different distros of Linux for about five years now but I still come back to Ubuntu. I'm also still attached to Micro$oft on my dual-boot laptop. Even after using WINE, I still can't get away from M$.\nOne of the great pleasures I find when using Ubuntu or any other flavor of Linux, is that I can still access and utilize the Window$ partition of the hard drive. I'm not yet accustomed to using LibreOffice and still rely on Micro$oft Office.\nGaramond has been included as a free font with M$ Office since its 2000 version. I have been able to install many of my fonts from M$ to Ubuntu. I crossed over to the Window$ partition, opened the Win. folder, opened the fonts folder, and installed a majority of the fonts.\nOf course this means one has to have access to Micro$oft Office and its fonts.\n", "Q: Bug report conundrum I'm running Kubuntu 12.04.

I purged grub off my system and have been using ReFind to select between Windows and Ubuntu. You don't need grub because the Linux kernel itself acts like a UEFI application and can be booted without using grub. Much cleaner as I don't need grub as a middleman to boot my Ubuntu.

My laptop, though, has an 80GB SSD drive, and after accounting for system files, swap, and other stuff, I have about 50GB available space for my Dropbox directory.\nI've discovered that if I move over 50GB of files into my Dropbox directory on my home computer, then it causes all sorts of hassle when I start up my laptop. It gets caught trying to sync more files than it has space for, and then gets in a bit of a loop, as I remove the newly synced files and it tries to re-download them.\nIn order to prevent this mistake happening in the future, it'd be great if I could set a limit on the size of my Dropbox folder on my home computer. Either make it fixed at a certain size, or warn me if it has more then a certain amount of data. Is this possible?\nI've looked into a linux command called quota, but it seems to involved mounts and partitions and I'm not sure if it's right for me, or if it can be used with my Dropbox folder. I'm hoping there's some configuration or third party software that can act on my existing setup.\n\nA: Dropbox has a settings in its Account preferences for each machine it is installed on for what folders to sync from your Dropbox account.

Now make a scan (search for this in the internet). Right after the scan is done and saving a backup, copy .log files in your home directory (where testdisk saves) to a safe place.\n\n*Now use your start and end addresses from step 5 and create the missing partition (The partition type is the one you've used for your luks. Mine was LINUX for ext4.).\n\n*Recheck everything, save backup, keep the backup and log files and then write the table.

You'll need to insert the removable USB stick for every first login after reboot or shutdown. Then, as long as you have active user session you can use just the fingerprint to get back to that session, for example, after closing and opening the lid.\nIf you don't have the media inserted at the first login, you have to type your password. After that, it'll work as usual, without the media.\nTechnical Details\nIt seems that your password is used as the key to encrypt your home folder. That means, that it is impossible to mount the home volume without the password. Fingerprint recognition subsystem in Ubuntu stores your password on a removable media to be able to decrypt the volume on first login. It encrypts the password file itself with fingerprint checksum or hash.\n", "Q: How to get the dropbox icon back without removing Chrome? I installed the newest Chrome-version (38).

My ISP (Cox) does this, only allowing connections to their own mail servers on port 25. For other email services, an alternate port has to be used which may necessitate the use of SSL or TLS rather than an open connection like port 25 gives you.\nHave a look at your ISP's website specifically regarding port 25.\nFirst try connecting to your ISP's email servers if available using port 25. If that works, it's probably an ISP restriction.\nAs a test, you can play around with netcat a bit:\nsudo nc -l -p 25\n\nThen in a new terminal, try a telnet connection to localhost:25. If the things you type are reflected in netcat, then it's again possible that it's a restriction on your ISP.\nTo further test and validate this, you can set up a port forward in your router for port 25 to your current PC and then attempt the same netcat trick. Instead, though, telnet to your public IP, port 25. If this fails, then it's almost surely an ISP restriction.\nNote: many ISPs use this practice -- including mobile providers such as Verizon. So, just because it didn't work on a tethered connection either doesn't mean it's not an ISP problem.\n\nSolution\nIt's possible to connect to Gmail in plain text (no secure negotiation) on port 587. Therefore, you should see that telnet smtp.gmail.com 587 works just fine!\n", "Q: How do I run only first command in backgound? I want to send only first command to run in background.

Low disk space! I wasn't expecting to use Ubuntu for so long, and I heard that the partition thingy is fixed, you only get to pick how much space you want once\nYou can't go back, that's what I heard\nIs there a way to increase the partition size 'without' blowing up the drive? Last time I used Gparted it emptied my drive that held my windows installation and files\nSince my Bitcoin wallet is stored on the windows partition, I'm not touching gparted this time\n\nA: With a dual-boot system, any partition changes can be dangerous.  Make a clonezilla (or similar program) backup of your entire drive before making any changes to your system.  This way, if you muck it up, you can always restore the image and try again.  I cannot stress this enough.  Make a good backup first!\nIf you boot into windows (Vista or newer), you can use the drive management system to shrink your windows partition.  (Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Computer Management -> Disk Mangement) Right click on your windows partition, and click Shrink Volume.  Then, re-boot into Ubuntu and use Gparted to increase the size of the Ubuntu partition to take up the newly freed space.\nGparted is your best bet for resizing your linux partition.  Windows is your best bet for resizing your windows partition.\nIf done in that order, you should be good to go!\n", "Q: Compiz plugins / filter - ordering Using Ubuntu 14.04. In Compiz, I have enabled Negative and OBS plugins (color filters). What I want is, filter A should be applied after filter B (I want to be able to control the order). How can I achieve that?\nNote: In particular, I want the Negative filter to be applied before OBS settings. To see why this is needed. Suppose I want 70% brightness (in OBS) and I want to invert the colors (prefer white on black). What I want is:\nOriginal:  Black on White (#000 on #FFF)\nAfter Negative:  #FFF on #000\nAfter OBS (final):  #AAA on #000 (approx).\n\nWhat is happening is, OBS is applied first, resulting in:\nAfter OBS:  #000 on #AAA\nAfter Negative (final):  #FFF on #444 (approx).\n\nResulting in overall more brightness than I want and increased glare.\n\nA: You have good question. And i confirm that i have same behaviour of Neg and OBS on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS.\nUnfortunately, Compiz developement for Ubuntu stops after 10.04 LTS, so no any bug reports or feature requests about Compiz going to be solved anymore. Even worse, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS are lack of Compiz Color Filter, which will solve your task with ease (and a lot more).\nSo currently there is no direct solution for you. But there is two more or less useful workarounds.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use any black window or picture as background, and from OBS, use Opacity instead of Brightness, on your target window. I use it and it work well, but weird when many windows opened.\n\n*There is a way exist to modify Neg filter so it can dim the window, but only by a fixed amount...\nA system without CCF is not useable for me. So i take some developement [1]. Finally i found a nice way to emulate CCF using Neg. And also, long lasting error with incorrect color inversion (Windows(R)-like inversion or simple RGB-inversion) was fixed by me. How to obtain it:\nWARNING, not for production machines. Try first on test machine!\nCheck you have correct version, both outputs should match:\n$ compiz --version\nCompiz 0.9.11.3\n\n$ dd if=/usr/lib/compiz/libneg.so bs=1 skip=46052 count=505\n\nvoid neg_fragment () {                                   \n    vec3 color = vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) - gl_FragColor.rgb; \n    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, gl_FragColor.a);          \n}                                                        \n 18PluginClassHandlerI9NegWindow10CompWindowLi0EE18PluginClassHandlerI9NegScreen10CompScreenLi0EEN10CompAction9ContainerE9NegScreen9NegWindowN10CompPlugin24VTableForScreenAndWindowI9NegScreen9NegWindowLi0EEE15NegPluginVTable\n505+0 records in\n505+0 records out\n\nCreate file neg-patch. Note, '1.0' is brightness you need:\nvoid neg_fragment(){;\nfloat l,d,i,a;\nvec3 t;\ni=gl_FragColor.r;\ni=min(i,gl_FragColor.g);\ni=min(i,gl_FragColor.b);\na=gl_FragColor.r;\na=max(a,gl_FragColor.g);\na=max(a,gl_FragColor.b);\nl=i+a;\nd=1.0-l;\nt=vec3(gl_FragColor.r+d,gl_FragColor.g+d,gl_FragColor.b+d)*1.0;\ngl_FragColor=vec4(t,gl_FragColor.a);\n}\n\nBackup:\nsudo cp /usr/lib/compiz/libneg.so /usr/lib/compiz/libneg.so.bk\n\nPatch:\nprintf '\\0\\0' >> neg-patch; cat neg-patch | sudo dd of=/usr/lib/compiz/libneg.so bs=1 seek=46052 conv=notrunc\n\nAnd check:\n$ dd if=/usr/lib/compiz/libneg.so bs=1 skip=46052 count=505\n\nRestart and viola, it should work. Sometimes it even takes to work immediately. We build our own CCF filter!\nAnd it all shows that all functionality need to implement CCF is exist inside current Compiz. So there is no real reason to remove so useful CCF from Ububtu's Compiz, except lazyness?\nThis solution is also compatible with melatonine/cold/warm color effects as described in lian1238's posts in [1]. Note you should never exceed 500 bytes size of your neg-patch file!\nHope it helps.\n-jpka\n[1] http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1419702\n", "Q: Cannot install scikit-learn in Python 3.4 in Ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to get scikit-learn to Python 3.4 in Ubuntu 14.04.

So I did.\nNow I am greeted with a message on startup which says\nerror: no such partition.\n\nEntering rescue mode\n\nGrub rescue>\n\nAnd I can't boot into windows like I hope I would have been.\nMy computer came with no windows recovery disk, so I downloaded an ISO and burned it to my USB, due to my laptop not having a disk drive. But the USB won't boot at pc startup so I can't access recovery, unless I have to click something before grub tries to load.\n\nA: You'll need Your Windows boot DVD.  Boot up on that DVD, and select Boot Repair.  This will remove GRUB and restore the windows boot loader.\nIf you would like to continue using Ubuntu on that machine, make a Live USB stick, and boot up off the stick whenever you would like to use it.  You can even bring use it on other computers and bring all your settings and files with you that way.  This method makes no changes to the host computer, so your parents shouldn't be able to complain.\nEdit: Just saw the issue with the windows USB stick.  You have to follow very precise instructions to get Windows installation media to work from a USB stick.  Best done from a working Windows computer.  Please check out this site:\nhttp://bootableusb.net/install-windows-7-usb-drive-easy-way/\n\nA: Enter the BIOS (usually F12, Delete, F2, or something -- look for \"Setup\" on the boot screen) or the boot menu. From the BIOS go to the Boot tab and move USB to the top of the list (usually F5 and F6 keys). Then, reboot and it should boot from the USB stick.\nOnce the USB boots, there should be an option for boot recovery on the first menu. Click that and let it do its thing and you should be left with a bootable computer and Windows only.\nNote: After doing this, move HDD back to the top of the list in the BIOS to prevent the computer not booting when certain USB drives are plugged in.\n", "Q: How can I copy files with duplicate filenames into one directory and retain both files by having the duplicate(s) rename automatically? On windows OS, when you copy a file into a directory that already has a file with that name, it asks you whether you want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the file and replace/overwrite the existing one\n\n*cancel copying the new file into the directory\n\n*copy the file, but rename it (as something like \"filename - copy (1)\")\n\n\nWhen I do this in Ubuntu, I don't have that 3rd option (which is a lot of times a very useful option). Is there any way to be able to do that in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Unfortunately Nautilus doesn't have that option.\nOption 1: A different file manager\nYou could try another file manager like Dolphin.\n (requires the Universe repository)\nOption 2: Command-line\nYou can also use the command line program cp(1) with the backup option:\ncp --backup -t DESTINATION SOURCE [SOURCE...]\n\nThis has the following effects which can be controlled with other options as described in the manual page of cp(1):\n\n--backup[=CONTROL] ― make a backup of each existing destination file\n-b ― like --backup but does not accept an argument\n-S, --suffix=SUFFIX ― override the usual backup suffix\nThe backup suffix is ~, unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX. The version control method may be  selected  via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable. Here are the values:\n\n*\n\n*none, off: never make backups (even if --backup is given)\n\n*numbered, t: make numbered backups\n\n*existing, nil: numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise\n\n*simple, never: always make simple backups\n\n\nExample\ncp --backup=existing --suffix=.orig -t ~/Videos ~/Music/*\n\nThis will copy all files in ~/Music to ~/Videos. If a file of the same name exists at the destination, it is renamed by appending .orig to its name as a backup. If a file with the same name as the backup exists, the backup is instead renamed by appending .1 and if that exists as well .2 and so forth. Only then is the source file copied to the destination.\nIf you want to copy files in subdirectories recursively use:\ncp -R --backup=existing --suffix=.orig -t ~/Videos ~/Music\n\n\nA: Found this on superuser:\n#!/bin/bash\ncp -vn \"$1\" \"$2\"/ || cp -vn \"$1\" \"$2\"/\"${1##*/}\"~\"$(md5sum \"$1\" | cut -f1 -d' ')\"\n\nThe file that has the same name gets renamed to the file with the md5sum added to the name.

As listed here, under specs, an AMD Radeon HD 7750 graphics card supports a max resolution of 4096x2160 @ 60 Hz per display, so you should be able to upgrade to a 4k monitor. Hope this helps!\n\nA: If you, like me, want to find out other compatible resolutions (lower that max) you can keep left shift pressed during boot and when GRUB shows up press the c key for command line.\nAt the grub > prompt enter command: videoinfo and it will show you a set of video resolutions compatible with your graphics card. Mainly to use when not in an graphical environment though.\n", "Q: How to upgrade to a beta version How can I install a Beta version as an upgrade to an existing OS.

I have an older Acer Aspire 5810T with a AMD ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4330 inside it. I've disabled the switchable option and am now only running the HD4330 card, but I'm having trouble with the driver.\nI'm running XUbuntu 12.04.5 and I've installed the legacy catalyst 13.1 driver which I manually downloaded from the AMD/ATIs website.\nAll good so far, it installs fine, except it says \"loki_setup (null)\". Don't really know what that means but dont think it matters very much.\nAll right, so I have the AMD Catalyst center installed and I can start games like Dota 2 which I couldn't before (Although the performance is way worse than when I used to run Windows 7. Really not playable honestly) - but now suddenly a Proprietary Driver shows up in the Additional Drivers app. Note that before installing the Legacy 13.1 thingy there was nothing there. Further it says that it's not enabled, so I try to enable it. That seemingly works, and it asks me to reboot - which I do. Now when I fire up Additional Drivers again, its gone. I can't remember exactly, but the name was something like\n\nFGLRX ATI/AMD ...\n\nAlso I can't start the AMD catalyst control centre anymore, and I get the error:\n\nThere was a problem initializing Catalyst Control Center Linux edition.

Boot0000 is the Ubuntu partition where GRUB is installed; by default I want to boot this partition. \nI found out that Boot0080 is the recovery partition of the old Mavericks installation, while Boot0081 is the Yosemite recovery partition. The partition where Yosemite is actually installed, in my case, is Boot0082.\nGRUB is not able to load Mac OS X directly, but I can configure EFI to load the Mac OS X partition when GRUB exits.\nSo I've run\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0000,0082\n\nWhich, to recap, means Boot0000, where GRUB is installed, will be run first, then if you exit grub (by pressing c end then typing the command exit) you can boot into Mac OS X.\nTo make the process of booting Mac OS X more comfortable you can add an entry to the GRUB boot menu which exits and thus starts Mac OS X. Just edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom and append the following\nmenuentry \"Exit to Max OS X\" {\n  exit\n}\n\nAnd reload the GRUB configuration with\nsudo update-grub\n\nAll should work.\n\nA: I recommend this (now deleted) answer on Stack Overflow (possibly also available via Wayback machine and if not here is a screenshot of it) by Ahmad Afif. The answer uses material from this Linux Mint Forums tutorial, which explains that\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Mac boots Mac OS by default. We need it to boot our GRUB menu instead. \n  \n*GRUB detects Mac OS but doesn't know how to boot it, so we need to fix that as well.\n  \n\nTo fix it, make a live USB and boot from it, then fix the boot order.\nInstall and run efibootmgr:\nsudo apt install efibootmgr\nefibootmgr\n\nOne line of the output shows the BootOrder, and below that line is a key showing the names of each code, for example\nBootOrder: 0080, 0000, ...\nBoot0000* ubuntu\nBoot0080* Mac OS\n...\n\nTo change the order to boot 0000 before 0080, you can use this command:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0,80\n\nRun efibootmgr again to check that the BootOrder has changed.\nNow GRUB will boot first, and we can use it to boot Ubuntu (or Mint in the case of the tutorial), or, to boot OS X, press esc and type exit. To avoid the latter step in future, it is often sufficient to boot into Ubuntu and run this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: If you were using rEFIt, you'll have to install rEFInd (I don't think it would work otherwise). The basic steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download rEFInd from http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/\n\n*Run ./install.sh form the unzipped folder you've just downloaded\n\n*Follow the instructions, shutdown (don't restart) and turn it on again.\n\n\nYou may also find this discussion useful: Cannot boot into Refit (to choose Ubuntu) on Mac after Yosemite Upgrade. This website also provides useful information on that rEFInd is: http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/\n", "Q: Extreme difficulty setting up VPN Oh my god, there are so many tutorials out there, and all of them involve complicated instructions that don't work.

I can't boot, so I've booted it using live USB. I wanted to check what's going on with my computer, but I don't know how to mount the partition.\nOn my disc (internal), I have two physical partitions, sda1 (/) and sda2, which is divided into two logical partitions - sda5 (swap) and sda6 (/home).\nsda1 and sda6 are not mounted.

Example:\nmkdir /media/home\nmount /dev/sda6 /media/home\n\nSince you're trying to reproduce the mount points of the on-disk system, I suggest you mount sda6 somewhere below the mount point of sda1, e. g.:\nmkdir /media/root\nmount /dev/sda1 /media/root\nmount /dev/sda6 /media/root/home\n\n", "Q: bogofilter issue.

You might best just download and burn an Ubuntu DVD and install fresh.  Starting fresh will ensure that you have files complete and can download whatever you want in a more personal manner.  Since you'e just getting the computer, what would you be loosing.\nAs far as passwords, having physical access to the computer, it would be easy to setup your own passwords.  Use the same install disk that I just suggested, login the try option, mount the drive and remove the root password from the boot partition.  Then you'd be able to log in as root and setup new passwords.\nOnce booting into the try ubuntu you can mount the disk from the commandline with:\nFind the partition with the Ubuntu installtion:\n$ cat /proc/partitions\n\nMount that partition:\n$ sudo mount /dev/[desired partition] /mnt\n\nThe desired partition is the one with the installation\n$ sudo nano /mnt/etc/passwd\nChange from:\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n\nChange to (remove the x from the password field):\nroot::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n\nNow you can exit out of the try ubuntu and boot to the OS.  You can log in as root and remove or change any of the passwords to whatever you want them to be.\n\nA: A simple way that doesn't involve enabling the root account (and is therefore more secure), would be to reset the user password from recovery mode with\npasswd [USERNAME]\n\nwhere [USERNAME] is the name of the user you're usually working as.\nAlternatively a live system can be used, which is more tedious as it involves mounting and setting up a chroot environment.\n", "Q: apt-get commands are failing with libpython3.3 unmet dependencies \n\nOS: Ubuntu 14.04, amd_x64. \napt-get commands such as install, remove and purge fail with the same error as shown below\nHowever commands like update and clean work fine.\nNot sure how to resolve the issue.

I want to get monoaural mp3's or wav's with just the left (or right) channel of every cd track.\nWhat's the fastest and easiest way to do it?\n\nA: You can indeed do this with the sox command-line audio processing tool. To select a single channel from an input file (for demonstration purposes, I use a wave file) and write it to a new wave file, the remix effect is used:\nsox stereo_inputfile.wav leftchannel.wav remix 1\nsox stereo_inputfile.wav rightchannel.wav remix 2\n\nIf you want to know more, this website lists a number of practical examples on how to use sox for a number of tasks.\n\nA: Here comes a bash-solution for multiple files within one folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Put all of you files into one folder, e. g. \"/run/dir/*\" in the example below\n\n*Create two folders in the level above the dir: e. g. \"/run/l_channel/\" and \"/run/r_channel/\"\n\n\nTo split all files of one folder into the other folders for the left and for the right channel you can do it like this:\nfor i in /run/dir/*\ndo \n    sox \"$i\" \"\"/run/l_channel/\"$(basename \"$i\")\" remix 1\n    sox \"$i\" \"\"/run/r_channel/\"$(basename \"$i\")\" remix 2\ndone\n\nNote: I tried this successfully under Manjaro Linux, but probably this works under Ubuntu, too.\n\nA: ffmpeg is always your friend.\nStereo -> Mono with L Channel\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -filter:a 'pan=mono|FC=FL' output.mp3\n\nStereo -> Mono with R Channel (just replaced FL with FR)\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -filter:a 'pan=mono|FC=FR' output.mp3\n\nSee pan - Audio Filters - FFmpeg Filters Documentation for the detail.\n\nA: Use audacity.

Pentium 4 HT @ 3.20 Ghz\nRam: 1536 MB\nLubuntu 14.04 LTS\nTo be clear, I want to know whether HT would slow Lubuntu down or not. I use it for daily use such as using Google Chrome (to be specific) and play flash games. Sometimes I use Word processing programs. I'll also play Minecraft online too. Any answers would be appreciated!\n(This time Google did not help me.)\n\nA: Generally a system profits from more (virtual) CPU cores as it has more processing power at its disposal. An individual application may not profit as much from it, if it doesn't exploit parallel execution mechanisms, but even then other processes running at the same time (in the background which you may not even notice) could use the other cores instead of competing for CPU time with the first application.\nToday's operating systems, desktop environments, and applications are much better at using parallelism than at the time the Pentium 4 appeared first, so even with a common application-centric workload scenario like yours, I strongly recommend enabling HyperThreading.\nIf you want to be certain if you benefit from it, you need to find or run benchmarks for your current setup. Everything else, including the above, can only ever be a rule of thumb. In my personal experience a desktop system with at least 2 cores is much more responsive than one with just 1.\n", "Q: wine error when I try open games i would like play Blade and soul on my Ubuntu 14.04 but when i try start terminal shows me error:\n\nfixme:mscoree:CLRRuntimeInfo_IsLoadable 0x7ea82204 0x33f5e8\nUnhandled Exception:\n  System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n    at EnglishPatch.My.MyProject.get_Application () [0x00000] in :0 \n  [ERROR] FATAL UNHANDLED EXCEPTION: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n    at EnglishPatch.My.MyProject.get_Application () [0x00000] in :0 \n\n\nA: Isn't it (mscoree.dll) part of MS .NET Framework?\nIf I am correct (NullReferenceException), you should install it by means of winetricks\n", "Q: New hard drive accessible to everyone OS: Ubuntu 14.04 desktop\nThe only way I've found out how to gain access to a second hard drive through nautilus is to re-install Ubuntu while the hard drive is in the computer.

I have tried many different suggestions found online about how to just set the security to world readable, but now I would like to just start over (without having to re-install Ubuntu). \nIn another attempt (re-install of Ubuntu), I deleted the original user that was created upon installation, so when I tried accessing the HD the second time it asked for the \"root\" password, of which, when I tried using the password of the deleted user, it didn't work of course.

It's important to use X (capital letter) instead of x because otherwise all files would be flagged executable, which is at best confusing and at worst a security problem.\n\nIf you're not the file owner you need to acquire superuser privileges first by prepending sudo to that command. To change the permission of a directory tree recursively, add the -R switch as the first argument.\nChanging ownership\nIf you want your main user account to own the file system root (e. g. because you want to use it for documents, multimedia or other non-system files), it would be more elegant to hand over the ownership to it:\nsudo chown [-R] \"$USER:\" [PATH...]\n\nThis will change the ownership over [PATH...] to user $USER (which is usually the name of the user currently logged in) and the group ownership to the default login group of that user. Again -R applies the changes recursively.\n", "Q: What component is responsible for tray and how to manipulate it using C++?

I was forced to restart the system in order to get to a login.  After following several suggestions on restarting an upgrade, I appear to have a system that is basically working, but I cannot log into the GUI, am forced to CTL+ALT+F1 (or F2-F6) to get a command line login.\nTh GUI reaction is to take the first attempt at entering a password, then responds with \"Logging in...\" directly below the user name that is logging in.  That's it, it just sits there.  If an attempt to use the mouse changes the name, the message goes away, but the GUI no longer accepts any more passwords.\nThe clue I have (and am hoping that is not a red-herring) is that the following appears in the /var/log/auth.log (I've removed timestamp, system name and user id):\nlightdm: PAM unable to dlopen(pam_kwallet.so):  /lib/security/pam_kwallet.so:  cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nlightdm: PAM adding faulty module: pam_kwallet.so\nlightdm: pam_succeed_if(lightdm:auth): requirement \"user ingroup nopasswdlogin\" not met by user \"userid\"\n\nI've tried several update commands, restarts, reboots, and clean-ups.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: Looks like pam_kwallet.so is missing.\nPAM is the authentication module used by lightdm and it wants to load kwallet (I guess that's a KDE keyring) but the library is gone.\nIf you have access (somehow), try to install the package containing the pam_kwalet.so, or try to configure PAM so that it would not look for this file.\nAutomatically: try running pam-auth-update and disable KDE wallet (kwallet).\nManually: PAM configuration is in /etc/pam.conf and /etc/pam.d/* -- so grep those for kwallet, (re)move configuration referring to kwallet and retry.\nOnce you are finished with upgrade then you may want to return the pam-kwallet config, just make sure you have pam_kwallet.so installed.\nLooks like Ubuntu bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+bug/1309535\n\nA: Ok, this is what I finally had to resort to in order to get past my problem above...\nI uninstalled/removed all the GUIs I had on the system (gdm and lightdm).\nI then reinstalled Unity.

But simple unplug and plug in resolves this. And it you suspend/shut-down/lock unplug headphones, come later log in and plug them in, you get your previous volume and until you plug them in the volume of the speakers will be the one you set for speakers last time. \nThis problem occurred because \"PulseAudio usually overwrites the ALSA settings\"\nFor more details see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio#Pulse_overwrites_ALSA_settings\nHope this helps someone in the future. \n", "Q: Wanted Ubuntu, got Mint I went to Ubuntu and went to the download page, chose 32 bit, for an older machine, made a CD.  When everything was said and done, I have Linux Mint 16 on the machine....how did that happen?  I'm new to Linux, but I can't find anywhere that it says this is what I was downloading.  Is it because I chose 32 bit?  Is it a screw up in the mirror?  Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: A mirror is automatically selected when you download Ubuntu at http://www.ubuntu.com/download or http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop. That's usually a very good way to get Ubuntu, but some problems, potentially including a wrong file on a mirror, can be solved by downloading directly from http://releases.ubuntu.com. I strongly suspect that will fix this for you, if the problem is really that your ISO image is for Mint.\nYou can also download with bittorrent.\nTo figure out what happened, I recommend very carefully checking through all the steps you carried out while burning the CD, in case you accidentally selected the wrong ISO image. Some CD/DVD burning software has confusing interfaces. (This is of course less likely to be the cause, if you have not ever previously downloaded a Mint image.) \nIf you'd written the ISO to a USB stick instead of burning it to a disc, I'd suggest making sure you didn't accidentally select the wrong option in the program you used to do that. For example, UNetbootin has an option to specify what OS to write to the USB stick. However, I don't know of any CD/DVD burning programs with similar functionality (and thus am mentioning this primarily for the benefit of others who may find this question while searching for help with a related problem).\nIf you wish to investigate this further, you can check that your ISO image is really the Ubuntu ISO you want it to be--and that it has not been corrupted--by calculating the md5sum of the ISO image and checking it against the appropriate ISO image's MD5 hash.\n", "Q: Installing/ running a program from a zip file The creator of a favourite writing tool, Write Or Die, has released a linux version version of the latest edition (found at writeordie.com).

I spent hours trying to sort this problem - Doh!\n\nA: on my toshiba tecra m5 i did not have any sound,i found that the \nsolution was to go in to bios and change the setting in configuration\ndevice config=setup by os,change to device config=all devices.\nthat solved it for me,i am running ubuntu 14.10.\ni hope this solution might be helpfull for others too.\n", "Q: Cannot access secondary GPU - error: Could not load GPU driver I tried multiple different drives, nvidia-340, nvidia-331, nvidia-331-updates, nvidia-343 and with the same result:\n# optirun -vv --debug bash\n[  785.862681] [DEBUG]Reading file: /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n[  785.863474] [INFO]Configured driver: nvidia\n[  785.863827] [DEBUG]optirun version 3.2.1 starting...\n[  785.863890] [DEBUG]Active configuration:\n[  785.863929] [DEBUG] bumblebeed config file: /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n[  785.863970] [DEBUG] X display: :8\n[  785.864056] [DEBUG] LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /usr/lib/nvidia-331-updates:/usr/lib32/nvidia-331-updates\n[  785.864092] [DEBUG] Socket path: /var/run/bumblebee.socket\n[  785.864120] [DEBUG] Accel/display bridge: auto\n[  785.864148] [DEBUG] VGL Compression: proxy\n[  785.864175] [DEBUG] VGLrun extra options: \n[  785.864212] [DEBUG] Primus LD Path: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/primus:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/primus\n[  785.864329] [DEBUG]Using auto-detected bridge virtualgl\n[  785.878755] [INFO]Response: No - error: Could not load GPU driver\n\n[  785.878771] [ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: Could not load GPU driver\n\n[  785.878775] [DEBUG]Socket closed.\n[  785.878790] [ERROR]Aborting because fallback start is disabled.\n[  785.878794] [DEBUG]Killing all remaining processes.\n\nMy Linux kernel\n # uname -r\n3.13.0-24-generic\n\nBumblebee.conf:\n# cat /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n# Configuration file for Bumblebee.

I can finally hit the Ubuntu mirrors. Probably the router records whether that step has been completed by any machine on the LAN, and if so it stop showing up at all. I am not sure how I didn't have any problems with the Laptop which is on the same LAN. I browsed to that page with a Windows PC anyway, while I am using the Server via ssh.

Anyone got the answer to that? Ill gladly mark it as correct. \nCheers\n\nA: From Ubuntu 15.04 onwards do:\nsudo systemctl enable [SERVICE]\n\nWhich in your case is:\nsudo systemctl enable postgresql\n\n\nA: In the case you don't use the default configuration, like a particular cluster folder, or a custom port, an alternative is to create a crontab task that triggers on startup; and configure that task to execute a script that starts the postgresql service or whatever you like.\nStep 1: switch to the postgres user\nsudo su - postgres\n\nStep 2: Use an editor to create the script named \"start.sh\" in the home folder of the postgres user, and fill it with the code that starts the postgresql service (or whatever you like). In my case (debian 10, and postgresql 11) the cluster folder (\"main\") is in a mounted disk (\"/mnt/disk\"), so the scrip is:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/pg_ctl -D /mnt/disk-b/main -l /var/log/postgresql/pg_ctl.log start\n\nStep 3: make said script be executable\nchmod +x $HOME/start.sh\n\nStep 4: create the crontab task that triggers on reboots.\ncrontab -e\n\nwhich opens an editor containing the tasks schedule associated to the postgres user.\nStep 5: Use the opened editor to insert a single line with this content\n@reboot $HOME/start.sh\n\nStep 6: verify the task was added\ncrontab -l\n\nNote that the start script is executed using the postgres user, which is a requirement according to the postgresql manual.\nEdit 1: If your postgresql installation package includes the command pg_createcluster, a better alternative is to use said command to create the cluster, and the systemctl command to start the \"postgresql\" service. This way the service is automatically configured to start at boot.\n", "Q: Change font colors in Grub2 I can't get the font colors to change at all; the only thing I've managed to accomplish is getting a custom background on the Grub screen.\nI tried grub-customizer but that doesn't work.\nI tried what was suggested here: How do I change the font colours for grub?\nbut that doesn't work.\n\nA: Yep, Grub Customizer didn't work for me as well in the latest Mint. I was only able to change the image background. Here is how to change font colors easily:\nIn Grub customizer, go to File > Change environment\nIn the dialog that opens check the CFG_DIR line to know where is the grub config directory for your system. In my case it shows:\nCFG_DIR: /etc/grub.d\nOpen your /boot/grub/grub.cfg in read only mode. At the top of the file you will see this warning:\n#\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE\n#\n# It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates\n# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub\n#\n\nThis is exactly what grub customizer does, it makes the grub.cfg from the templates you have in CFG_DIR.\nSearch in grub.cfg for this text: \"set menu_color_normal\"\nChances are that this line appears in a couple of places. Pick the one closest to the end of the file that is not inside an if. For instance, this one not:\nif background_image /boot/grub/splash.png; then\n    true\nelse\n    set menu_color_normal=white/black\n    set menu_color_highlight=black/light-gray\nfi\n\nIt will be something like this one:\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/06_mint_theme ###\nset menu_color_normal=white/black\nset menu_color_highlight=black/light-gray\n### END /etc/grub.d/06_mint_theme ###\n\nSee the begin and end tags around it? That is the template from where grub customizer is obtaining the font color config. And yes, it totally ignores what you set in the GUI. In my case, it is /etc/grub.d/06_mint_theme as I'm on a Mint distro.

Maybe give that a whirl?\nI assume you've also uninstalled, purged, and reinstalled indicator-multiload, just in case successive overlay upgrades are the reason behind it being strange?\nBest of luck!\n\nA: I'm monitoring CPU, mem, net, swap, load and disk at 500 ms intervals and getting single digit usage 2%-6% on an Intel Dual core E6500. I consider this a minimal load and am unconcerned. changing to 2000 ms as you have results in usage between 1% -3% on this CPU. When determining whether usage is excessive one must consider the efficiency of the CPU in use and the necessity of the monitoring. \nOne way to reduce the usage without changing the code would be to simply uninstall it. \nAnother way would be to upgrade to a more efficient (faster) CPU.\n", "Q: android studio not launching I have downloaded the zip and extracted it to a file and I have eclipse, but everytime i try launching android studio an error pops up saying,\nFailed to execute child process \"/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\" (No such file or directory)\n\nI am a beginner to both coding and ubuntu and I want to create an android app.\n\nA: Install Android Studio with this command in Terminal :\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:paolorotolo/android-studio \nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install android-studio\n\nAnd for more info see this:\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/index.html\n", "Q: Unable to type in a terminal When I open a terminal no cursor appears, and no text, I just get a blank black screen.

When you checked it in the morning, some process cleared the tempspace.\nIt's nothing to worry about, and probably was just a glitch in the system.\n\nBased on your comment that it was a \"hack attempt\", that is probably the best answer. During the hack, some glitch or bug was introduced. It also may have just been a large amount of temp files (think memory overflow). Nothing to worry about in the long run.\n\nA: Are you the only person who can login this box?\nWhy I ask this question is, it looks you are running an application which generate huge log file or other files (for example, turn on the debug option in applications, it fills the space very quickly).

Log out, log in, check that the variable is set: \n[romano:~] % env | grep EDI\nEDITOR=vim\n\nand now all the programs that call an editor (and are well written) will default to vim for your user. \nAs noticed by @EliahKagan (thanks!) in the comment, this will not work for visudo: since you are supposed to call it using sudo, when you do \nsudo visudo\n\nthe sudo command will sanitize (read: delete) most environment variables before rising privileges --- and it's a good thing it does. So the change will not percolate to visudo.

Avast is giving some false alarms when i'm accessing it so I checked with Sucuri.\nThe only problem that Sucuri sees is that I have Apache 2.4.7 and it's marked as High Risk.\nI've been searching for over an hour on how to update my Apache but to no avail.\nI've searched for the latest version, it's 2.4.10 but I have no idea to \"install it\" or update it, or patch it.\nI've done the apt-get update/upgrade 10 times, Apache stays the same. The OS is Ubuntu 14.04 Server 64bit.\nPlease help!\n\nA: That is the latest version available for Ubuntu 14.04 from the official repositories.

Or in other words, after the user is automatically logged in, the screen is locked immediately.\nThe user login is specifically needed; it's not about starting a service at boot time (which is achievable with different means).\nIs this behaviour possible?

I've just set up my PC (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) and installed my choice of software.\nOn the .php files I set Firefox as the default software to open with but now it opens about 50 odd tabs in the space of 3 seconds. How do I fix this?\n\nA: To parse a php file, you need a server set up (apache for example) and you need firefox to query for this file with the server. So install apache (or a server of your preference), set the DocumentRoot.\nNow you can try typing the URL of the file relative to DocumentRoot in the addressbar of firefox, like so: localhost/index.php. This will open the file normally.\nExplanation:\nWhat's happening is, firefox doesn't process a php file by itself, it doesn't know how. So when you open it, it treats it as a file to be downloaded and opened, so it downloads and tries to open it. Now since the default software to open a php file is firefox itself, a new tab is opened, and the whole process repeats indefinitely.\nWhen you type the address of the file in addressbar, firefox actually makes a request to Apache (or whichever server) for the file, and the server will do the task of parsing php and converting it into HTML.\n", "Q: How to get rid of cloud-init? I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 image as my base box for vagrant. Unfortunately this base box contains cloud-init which causes many problems during starting-up the machine: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/3860\nI'm not using my machine in the cloud so I don't really need this. I though typing:\nsudo apt-get remove cloud-init\n\nwill solve my problems but the machine still spend about 3 minutes on startup trying to configure something I don't need.\nI can see there a a number of cloud-init related files in /etc/init (for example cloud-init.conf, cloud-final.conf, cloud-config.conf etc). I could delete them but I'm not sure if this is safe.\nI've also installed rcconf to check all starup scripts but I can't find anything related to cloud-init there. Any ideas?\n\nA: On 14.04 you can use dpkg-reconfigure to disable cloud-init in the following way:\necho 'datasource_list: [ None ]' | sudo -s tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90_dpkg.cfg\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive cloud-init\n\nor just use sudo dpkg-reconfigure cloud-init to do it interactively.\n\nA: Cloud Init is there to configure networking and it can be stopped at different stages. In recent versions, you can disable Cloud Init at the first stage by making sure the following file exists:\n/etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled\n\nor at a later stage by making sure the file /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg exists with the following content:\nnetwork: {config: disabled}\n\nYou can use this command for it:\n$ sudo echo \"network: {config: disabled}\" > /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg\n\nThis information can be found in the header comments of /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml, which in part read as follows:\n\n# To disable cloud-init's network configuration capabilities, write a file\n# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:\n# network: {config: disabled}\n\n\nThis is from the file in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and likely to also be valid for later releases.\n\nA: A simpler way may be to just disable it - according to the cloud-init docs the way to disable it is:\nsudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled\n\nAnd/or set cloud-init=disabled on the kernel command line if it's enabled that way.\n\nA: This worked for me in Ubuntu Server 18.04.1 LST\n\n\n*\n\n*$ echo 'datasource_list: [ None ]' | sudo -s tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90_dpkg.cfg\n\n*$ sudo apt-get purge cloud-init\n\n*$ sudo rm -rf /etc/cloud/; sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cloud/\n\n*$ reboot\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: Shrinking root using logical Volume Management Currently, Ubuntu 14.04 is my only OS. so, i decide to shrink my root to install windows 7. i use logical volume management but it says: \n\"Logical volume is not mounted but is in use.

It will add the correct file extensions (if missing), of the following types: \nrgb, gif, pbm, pgm, ppm, tiff, rast, xbm, jpeg, bmp, png \n\nIf the file already has a file extension, it will be skipped.

I also disabled the feature Activate at book.\nAfter that I installed iptables-persistent for restoring my iptables rules after reboot.\nThe problem is my iptables are empty after reboot.\nWhats wrong here?\n\nA: What iptables-persistent does is it saves the rules to /etc/iptables/rules.v4 or /etc/iptables/rules.v6 at install time, and by using webwin to remove the rules, it saved a ruleset that had no rules.\nNote that ip6tables uses /etc/iptables/rules.v6, while iptables uses /etc/iptables/rules.v4.\nAdd your rules to the iptables and ip6tables firewalls.  Then, do the following commands on the command line:\nsudo su -c \"iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4\"\nsudo su -c \"ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6\"\n\nOnce you reboot or restart, the rules are refreshed from those rules, and you should then have your firewall rules restored.

I have worked on many systems (although not an expert with Linux). But the following is true.\nHardware built by several companies have routine problems with keyboard mapping, when using Linux. This is because problem manufacturers create a different keyboard map for each series of products. Sometimes this even extends to discreet models.\nWhen buying the hardware from the store, or directly from the manufacturer; you receive the included Windows WITH the patches from the manufacturer. Each manufacturer, creates their own patches to overcome many problems that would be extant if Windows was installed as just the OEM distribution.\nThis happens because manufacturers do not standardize around a set of hardware components, or even several known sets. Some manufacturers even build their own integrated circuits which require private drivers for proper operation.\nManufacturers who are known to build their own IC's are: Lenovo, Samsung, Acer, Asus.\nManufacturers who build unique keyboard maps, year over year: anything designed by companies that exist outside the United States. This includes companies from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, China. These companies include: Asus, Acer, Samsung, Toshiba, Lenovo, and several others.\nSystems that I have found standardized their keyboard layouts: Hewlett Packard, Dell, Gateway, and a few others.\nThis does not mean all the function-key shortcuts work, but the important ones (volume and brightness, for example) are sure to work. Most U.S. designed system have standardized their standard peripherals around REALTEK  IC components for things like keyboard and mouse, and web-camera and some other stuff. And explains why Ubuntu can provide a better keyboard map, and the associated drivers for these systems.\nHardware drivers, not available via Ubuntu depositories can sometimes (but not always) be found on the Internet. I have found a Lenovo that did not work on WIFI or Ethernet, and both drivers were eventually found by the owner, after looking around for about 3-weeks, with a different computer. Each of these had to be installed the hard way. Instructions for installing non-standard drivers into Ubuntu (or any other Linux for that matter) is available on the Internet and via the help services in Ubuntu website.\nI don't mean to sound terse, but I have become VERY disenchanted with any computers designed outside the U.S., because of the above problems. There are even some Acer systems (yours is a Asus) which have been firmware inhibited from reliably booting into Ubuntu. Luckily, Acer has gotten away from that practice, some years ago; and at this point, I have not seen that problem raise its' ugly head in a while.\nI leave you with the above info, in the firm hope that you can work around the problems you are experiencing.\nHave fun and good luck!\n", "Q: SSH a Ubuntu Server with external ip I have a Ubuntu server set up at my house and I am able to connect to it using SSH with its local IP. \nHow can I connect to it from anywhere with its external ip?\n\nA: You might want to take it the long way, which is what I usually do.. ;) \n\n\n*\n\n*Do you have a static IP for your router/internet connection?

I tried to see some projects like Beowulf Cluster and TORQUE but I didn't understand much.\nThanx in advance :)\n\nA: There was an attempt to develop an ad hoc clustering solution for Ubuntu from within the Community called easy-ubuntu-clustering. But it seems it did not pass the dicussion phase.\nMore than software, Clustering is above all a matter of methodology. Setting up a Beowulf cluster in particular is mostly about setting up the mechanisms by which nodes communicate and share resources. There are protocols for both tasks; MPI in particular is used in most Linux based solutions.\nVarious guides can be found on the web presenting different methods; a quick collection:\n\n\n*\n\n*A bio-informatics graduate from the Netherlands produced a detailed guide based on MPICH for communication and NFS for asset sharing.\n\n*Advanced Linux provides an alternative (and shorter) guide, also based on MPICH and NFS. \n\n*At Linux.com there is a quick and simple guide for Ubuntu 8.04 convering solely communication (with an earlier version of MPICH) that may be worth checking out. \n\n*Digital Ocean present a VPN based method for their private network product that also uses MPI.    \n", "Q: Deleting input back to the last forward slash I will very often be flitting between several files on a server.

From what I understand, the backward-kill-word readline function which in fact delete all characters untill the previous special character (/, ;, , etc.) is bound to the \\e\\C-h key sequence. Now, in this sequence \\e represents the Esc key, \\C - the Ctrl key, and \\C-h stands for Ctrl+h which is equivalent in this case with Backspace key.\nSo, you are searching for Esc+Ctrl+h keyboard shortcut which is equivalent with Esc+Backspace and which, because of xterm's behaviour that make Alt key to act as a meta character and meta characters are converted into a two-character sequence with the character itself preceded by Esc (see man xterm), is equivalent with Alt+Backspace.\nNow, if you don't like it and you continue to forget it, you can use the following command to create a new shortcut, let say Esc+w, for your purpose:\nbind '\"\\ew\": backward-kill-word'\n\nTo make this new shortcut persistent all the time for all commands that uses readline, add the following line line to your ~/.inputrc file:\n\"\\ew\": backward-kill-word\n\nSee help -m bind | sensible-pager for more info.\n\nA: I think you're looking for the Alt+Backspace shortcut.\nAfter pressing Up this should delete back to the previous / or space character.\n\nA: Another key combination is:\nAlt+B then Ctrl+K\nAlt + B     Move cursor backward one word on the current line    \nCtrl + K    Clear the line after the cursor\n\nAlt+B then Alt+D\nThis removes last word without deleting special char between words.\n", "Q: How to highlight and annotate PDF and DjVu documents?

I know that I can use the align and distribute functionality of libreoffice impress to align objects. However, when I want to align two objects, both of them move if I choose to align their centers. How can I use one of them as a reference point.\nInkscape, for example, has a \"Relative to\" option when aligning different objects. The \"Relative to\" can get values such as \"First selected\", \"Last selected\" etc. If \"First selected\" is chosen, the first object will be the reference point and it will not move.\n\nA: You can protect an object position (i.e. your reference object).\nRight click on the reference object, select Pozition and Size…. Check Position option under \"protect\" (see the screenshot below); then do the alignment.\n\nPS: It seems LibreOffice takes the relative center of the whole two objects, i.e. the centerline of a surface covering two objects, and then move all of them so that their centers sit on that centerline.\n", "Q: Webcam not detected in cheese, also not listed in lsusb I have dell inspiron n5110 laptop with windows 7 and ubuntu 14.04 installed in it.

I was working normally and suddenly one program collapsed: it got unresponsive and its window went grey. After that it did appear this message asking what to do: close the program or wait for it to respond.\nI selected close the program, but it didn't worked as intended: the whole ubuntu did freeze up and I couldn't do anything.\nI realize then that typing Ctrl + Alt + t I could open the terminal, and it did worked: it opened the terminal. But I didn't know what to do next.\nSo my question is: What to do from the terminal if a program freezes up? In my case it was nautilus (I was connecting to a remote server, using it as an FTP program) and I ended up rebooting the machine with sudo reboot. \nIt sucks. It would have been far better to close the unresponsive program, but how may I do that? And what if I don't know the unresponsive program's name?\nFYI, I've read this topic \"UI elements become completely unresponsive\" and I don't think it's the same case here, because I don't normally have this issue, it's sometwhat uncommon, and the memory is working fine, and the machine is a pretty new one (intel Core i7, 8 Gb ram).\n\nA: You can do xkill. This nifty little utility automatically mauls the next window you click. \nAnother option you can use is something called top or htop. Look for a weird process, especially something marked as a \"zombie\" or taking up lots of system resources. You can then kill it using the K key. Use kill code 9, as that causes an instant and forced kill of the process. \nSay the bad program is nautilus. Use one of these methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use xkill in the terminal and click on the Nautilus window. X will terminate its session, causing Nautilus to crash. Spam the ESC key for a few seconds to make sure Xkill stll isn't running.\n\n*killall -9 nautilus\n\n*Run top, look for nautilus, and kill it from top.\n\n\nNote that you might need to use sudo privileges to kill some processes.\n\nA: One of the big advantages of a terminal based system we have is that the answer is a sounding YES.\nWhat I normally do is switch to terminal 1 (your desktop is always in terminal 7) with control-alt-f1. \nIf you know what the program is this is going to be pretty easy: find the process ID of that task and kill it. The task will disappear on terminal 7 and if this fixed the crash your system will respond again.\nExample using firefox: when you start firefox it gets a process ID and you can view these with ps -ef | grep firefox. Replace firefox with whatever you want to search. \nps -ef |grep firefox\nrinzwind  5046  1484 48 19:52 ?        00:00:01 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox\nrinzwind  5113  4992  0 19:52 pts/4    00:00:00 grep --color=auto firefox\n\n(the process referring to the grep is my command)\nThe 1st number behing my login name is the process ID. kill -9 5046 will kill firefox:\n~$ kill -9 5046\n~$ ps -ef |grep firefox\nrinzwind  5148  4992  0 19:54 pts/4    00:00:00 grep --color=auto firefox\n\nand firefox is gone on my desktop.\nThe problem normally is to identify the correct process ID: when you have 5 firefox sessions open...getting the correct one will be a bit of a problem. Then you might need to add in some more logic to narrow it down.\n\nWarning: use common sense. Killing the lower process IDs (under 500) should be avoided. \n", "Q: play sound on different outputs, based on what display its the \"player\" is displayed on?

Can I change some setting so it's allowed?\n\nA: Go to System Settings -- > Brightness & Lock panel from the Unity Launcher. \nWhere you will find a tick option like \"Require my password when waking from suspend\". Just uncheck the tick option. I hope that this will do the needful\n", "Q: How can I display directories in the \"Recent\" folder? \"Recent\" folder in Nautilus only displays recent files.\n\nCan it display recent folders too, such as in the \"save as\" interface?\n\n\nA: Are you looking for the folders in which Recently Used Files reside, or are you just looking for Recently Accessed folders?\n(Note that, Recently Accessed folders are listed on the Unity Dash \"Home\" scope, under \"Files and Folders\").\nIf you follow the premise that a folder will be considered to have been Recently Accessed, if a file within the folder was recently used, then you can see all folders for recently used files...\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on \"Recent\" in the Nautilus left pane, under \"Places\".\n\n*Click on the \"View items as a list\" button at the top right of Nautilus.

This virtual disk 0 consists of 6 physical disks.  Each disk comes with 1TB disk space. I used the bootable CD that I created to try to install uBuntu 12.04 server.  During the installation process, I only saw the virtual disk 0 was available for partition. Shall I partition the physical disks and configure the software array during the installation of uBuntu 12.04 or shall I configure the RAID 5 in Dell r710 and then partition the virtual disk 0 during the installation of uBuntu 12.04?\n\nA: That's the point of HARDWARE RAID, the physical disks are abstracted away behind the virtual disk you created so all the OS has to care about is one disk. It has no idea it's a RAID volume, it's not necessary.\n", "Q: nfs unworkable using new managed switch - no idea why - DoS of two ZyXel switches breaks portmap I spent 3 nights and part of days, googling and reconfiguring servers of home network with two nfs vers=3 servers that suddenly stopped working.\nThey were working with zero issues using automount from 3-4 clients.\nThis is nothing productive, I have them at home just to test things or so, but there are some photos and movies and so sitting on ZFS on one or the other server.\nNothing worked suddenly, and no progress achieved.. neither rm /etc/default/nfs-* apt-get purge&install, neither various attempts to start rpc.mountd or statd and watch its output.. \nWell, but there is third machine with nfs3 server, a router with OpenWRT serving just an USB key. This one do work with zero troubles from all pcs, regardless of those two Ubuntu servers dead..\nSo, I did suspect Ubuntu updates. I found nfs-utils package removed few months ago.. And I was not sure when it stopped working.\nSymptoms:\nshowmount -e server takes 2 to 3 minutes to show answer, but answer is correct.\nrpcinfo -p server takes around one minute or more, shows right output.\nmount.nfs xx:/x/x /mnt/test -o vers=3 ends after minute or two with error.\nping or mount samba of those servers works without troubles, \niperf says around 1gigabit as expected (or less but still nice when client is using wifi).\ntelnet to portmapper port and nfs port opens a session. \nFirewall is off. Even added ALL:lanip to  Hosts.allow.\n- every trouble regards only Ubuntu servers, OpenWrt one responds in a fraction of second and do work as expected from all clients. But it does not support nfs4.\n- one of servers is 12.04.5 LTS with Trusty HWE stack, \n- second server is 14.04 LTS Trusty.\nAll updates installed.\nOne of them uses nic bonding (mode0) of two interfaces, second one does not.\nReason, without explanation:\nTo make long story a bit shorter, few minutes ago I got a crazy idea to try, and exchanged my new ZyXel GS1900-8 managed switch for old cheap (but also gigabit) tplink.\nAnd I went mad, as my NFS servers started working in that moment. \nGazing at the switch, I have no idea what is going wrong with him.\nNow I recall that I did enable LLTP and installed lltpd on all pc's, just to have fun seeing their name in port list. \nAnd I did some testing with bonding using 803.ad LACP which was not supported by old switch and is working on new one, but I turned it off (back to mode 0) as it was avoiding WoL that I am using regullary and consider necessary..\nPlease tell me what to check, or take some guess of what the reason it could be..\nWhere to look and what commands to try to find the difference? I got wery curious.\n\nA: It ends by finding that managed switches with DoS (denial of service) feature enables, detects SYN<1024 portmap requests and start blocking them. \nTurning this feature off solves the problem completely.  \nI cant detect the problem otherwise than trying rpcinfo -p or showmount -e, because all ports are accesible when trying just telnet.  \nGoogle found common messages, after I already know what to search, e.g. https://serverfault.com/questions/367107/cant-mount-nfs-share-over-tcp\nAnd different brands of switches are mentioned (mine are ZyXel, their PoweConnect and also Cisco).  \nIMHO, with managed switches getting cheap and common, this problem may reappear may times, and perhaps is the reason for another nfs troubles mentioned on askubuntu.\n", "Q: Alienware 17 + Ubuntu 14.04 Unable to CD boot Ubuntu 14.04 on (new) Alienware 17. My guess is graphics card issue. AMD Radeon R9 M290X. Any advice?

The focus of the cursor is already in the command line so back the cursor up before the\n--\n\nand type in the extra commands above.  It forces the linux kernel framebuffer to load normal vga mode.  I know I have seen a table of all the available values you can specify for vga mode but I cannot remember where I saw it. Setting it to \"normal\" worked for me when all other settings did not. Upon more research the nomodeset does this:\n\nAdding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\n\nSo use both.  I found after much digging that this was a graphics issue.  \n-Steve  (noob Ubuntu user)\n", "Q: how to create a shortcut to unlock my pc So basically how do i add a shortcut to unlock my pc when it is locked without having to type my password and i was wondering if it is possible to remove password from the lock screen so it only works if you use the shortcut.\n\nA: You can not set short cut to login but you can set user with no user following the steps given below.\nFirst, if your user has sudo privileges, you must enable its NOPASSWD option. Otherwise, sudo will ask for a password even when you don't have one, and won't accept an empty password.\nTo do so, open the sudoers configuration file with sudo visudo, and add the following line to the file, \nUser_name ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nClose the editor to apply the changes, and test the effect on sudo in a new terminal.\nDelete the password for your user by running this command, replacing david with your username:\nsudo passwd user_name -d\n\nIf you ever get prompted for a password, just type enter and it should work. \nNote : You can use GUI to select Log in without a password option from user accounts \n", "Q: Wireless icon not showing in the panel I just installed the Ubuntu 14.04 and I cant see wireless icon in the panel or any settings related to the wireless icon.\n\nA: Use the following command to list the interfaces,\nsudo iwconfig\n\nPlease check whether you have installed wireless adapter\nTo check what drivers your wireless adapter is currently using, you may run the following command:\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nlshw lists information on your hardware\n-C network filters the output to only show the network class.\nIn the output, look for the entry with description: Wireless interface and the driver.\nAlternatively, you can use the command:\nlspci -nnk | grep -A2 0280\n\nlspci lists information on your PCI connected cards\n-nnk instructs lspci to output more information about these cards (including the driver being used)\n| pipes the output to the next command\ngrep 0280 filters the output to show lines containing 0280, which is the PCI class code for wireless PCI controllers in Ubuntu.\n-A2 shows two more lines of information.\nIf no driver is installed please follow the below link install Broadcom 802.11 Linux STA driver\n1) Depending on your system download 32 or 64 bit package\nfrom http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php\n2) Go to a terminal to the dir with package.\n3) tar -xvzf hybrid-portsrc-.tar.gz\nReplace version with one you have\n4) Install kernel headers (eg. in fedora “yum install kernel-headers”)\n5) make -C /lib/modules/uname -r/build M=pwd\nif There were no errors\n6) Unload Modules from memory\nrmmod ndiswrapper b43 ssb bcm43xx b43legacy\n7) For WPA\nmodprobe ieee80211_crypt_tkip\n8)Check if Compiled Module is working\ninsmod wl.ko\nNow Probably a new interface will be there for wireless (wlan0 or eth-1)\nTo check it run\niwconfig\niwlist scanning\nAND YES !!

Is there a (semi-)automated way of forcing Krusader to use Ubuntu's (14.04) file associations?\nI know I can do it manually, for each file extension. But, for example, yesterday I installed PlayOnLinux, and now Krusader opens PNG files in WINE Internet Explorer. While the Ubuntu's file manager (or the desktop) uses Image Viewer, as it should. Similar things happen when I install other programs (such as Okular), and it comes to the point where I have no idea which program will start when I open a file.\n\nA: One workaround is to create an useraction (Useractions > Manage user action) that does:\nxdg-open %aCurrent%;\n\nand keymap it (Settings > Configure Shortcuts) to something like Ctrl + Enter. Mapping to just Enter does not seem possible.\nWorks because Ubuntu seems to follow freedesktop.org and use the same apps as xdg-open.\nDolphin specific question: How to change file association for files opened in Dolphin from command line in GNOME?\n\nA: This looks to be an old question but I was struggling with the same issue and found a solution so I am adding the answer for the googlers. \nIn my case the problem was that the file owner ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list was root, probably from running Krusader as root and changing some settings.\nAfter sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list I was able to change the file properties and set the associations for the file type.\n\nA: right click on the file -> Properties then \nChoose the Open with tab and either choose from a list or add one (by choosing from an extended program list or simply typing vlc as the command)\n(OR)\nUse Ubuntu Tweak - it has a file association manager and you can choose which programs open which file types.\nInstructions are on this site http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/new-version-of-ubuntu-tweak-released/\nBest way to install is:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\n\nA: As explained in this reply, KDE apps do use the ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list file, but they use the [Added Associations] section in that file.\nIn your case of .png files, you would need something like this:\n[Added Associations]\nimage/png=eog.desktop;wine-extension-png.desktop;shotwell-viewer.desktop;\n\neog is the \"Image Viewer\".\nYou can find the default Ubuntu associations in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list under a [Default Applications] section. Just remember that KDE seems to use the [Added Associations] section instead.\nAlso, it may be looking for a different mime type than what you think. I had this problem with .html files which krusader wanted to open with \"winebrowser\", even though I had text/html pointing to firefox. It turned out that I had to add\napplication/x-extension-html=firefox.desktop;\n\n\nA: In mine case it was deleting the file: \n~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\nand after restarting, the Krusader creates a new file with correct content.\n", "Q: User has full access with FTP, limited access with SFTP I'm running Ubuntu Server 14.04, and I followed these instructions to set up a user account that should be limited to its own home directory. The problem, however, is that FTP access is still allowed for the user account and when the account connects via FTP it has full view access to the entire filesystem. When the user uses SFTP, access is properly limited to the user's home directory. How do I correct this to block FTP access entirely? (Note: SSH access is blocked as it should be. The PuTTY window simply closes when the user tries to log in, no message is displayed or anything.)\nAlso, I want this user to be able to edit a subdomain on my server (apache2). I have a symlink set up pointing from /home/user/index to /var/www/subdomain, the symlink is owned by the www-data group (of which the user is a member), and the subdomain directory and all files are also owned by www-data, but the user cannot access the symlinked directory via SFTP. How do I make this all work together properly?\n\nA: I received an answer at the Ubuntu Forums, so I'll post a summary here as well.\nSince I have SFTP configured properly, I was advised to remove FTP entirely and only connect via SFTP (this means uninstalling vsftpd entirely, as OpenSSH handles SFTP, not vsftpd). Doing that solved the problem of the whole filesystem being viewable via FTP.\nAs to the problem of the web server not being accessible, I needed to use mount to mount the directory, rather than using a symlink. mount doesn't survive a server reboot, however, so I edited /etc/fstab to contain /var/www/subdomain    /home/user/index    none  0 0, and the problem was resolved after a server reboot.\n", "Q: Where does chromedriver install to? I've executed sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver for selenium, but which chromedriver does not return anything.\n\nA: The answer (from package search) is /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver\nTo put the chromedriver binary in the path, you would write export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/chromium-browser/.\n", "Q: Moving /boot to a usb key How do I move the existing /boot partion of a 14.04 root encrypted installation to a usb key?\n\nA: Test this:\nIn a normal session:\nInsert the usb stick.\nOpen a terminal.

Every decent drawing/vectorial software like Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw shows-up a dialogue asking how would you like to replace the fonts type-faces that it wasn't able to find on the system, something like this:\nIllustrator Font Replacement Dialogue\nI cannot find a way do it in Inkscape. When I try to open or import a AI or PDF file it only shows \"Replace PDF Fonts by closest-named installed fonts\" which doesn't works very well. Does anyone knows how could I use such a feature?\n\nA: In Inkscape 0.91 there is an extension called \"Replace font\" (find it under Extensions -> Text). It can list all the used fonts in the document, and you can do a find & replace for specific fonts, or replace all fonts by one of your choice. (Note that you have to fill in the font names by hand, or copy-paste, there's no drop down to choose from).\n", "Q: Where should I install bootloader in a system with multiple disks?

However, it really does not matter. GRUB works fine across disks, so you can install it to the other drive if you really want. I recommend an install to sdb though just for simplicity and ease-of-maintainence later on (esp. if you need to re-install GRUB). \nIt is really your choice.

Now I have another hp but this time a laserJet pro m127fw and cannot connect it. The printer itself shows that it is not connected to the computer but the computer says otherwise.\nI have been trying for the past two weeks. I am new to this and feel very stuck. I don't know what else to do at this point. This is my 8th printer. After trying six I was told the other brands does not work with ubuntu, got a brother they said the same. I was told only hp does so I got this one.\nSomeone please HELP\nThanks\n\nA: Please try the below steps which may help,\n\n*\n\n*Ping your printers and check whether it was successfull\n\n\n*To get started, open Printers utility from Unity Dash search results\nor System Settings.\n\n\n*Once it opens, go to menu Server -> Settings\n\n\n*Check the box where it says “Publish shared printers connected to\nthis system” to enable network sharing of connected printers.\n\n\n*Finally, right-click on a printer in the list and go to its\nProperties window. Under Policies tab, make sure all three boxes\n(Enabled, Accepting jobs, and Shared) are checked.\nNow try to connect to your printer from Ubuntu client using Internet Printing Protocol (ipp://ip.address.or.name/printers/Printername).\nIf Issue persists, please install CUPS to get rid of it\n\n*\n\n*CUPS is installed right into Ubuntu and Linux Mint and if for some strange reason can’t find it, you can easily install it with the following command.\nsudo apt-get install cups\n\n\n*Now the page would look something like in the image below. As you could have already recognized with the Unity dock on the left, we are running Ubuntu (13.10). You will be able to access CUPS on the same address on Linux Mint, or any other Linux distribution with CUPS as well. Once you are on this page, click on “Administrator”, and then click on “Add Printer.” You might be asked for username and password of your computer.\n\n\n\n*In the “Add Printer” page, choose the appropriate option – choose local HP Printer (HPIP) or printer or Other Networks Printers or Select Internet Printing Protocol.\n\n\nIn the connection field you will have to enter the IP address of your printer in the format, socket://hostname and hit continue.\nIt could look something like this, socket://10.33.20.23\n\n\n*In this page you will be asked to give a name, description and location of your machine, you can also choose if you want to share this printer or not with the sharing option. Hit “continue” to go to the next page. In this page you will have to choose your printer manufacturer and subsequently the model and hit “Add printer.” You could find almost all the printers in the list, if you don’t, you will manually have to add the PPD file, which will have all the information required.\n\n\n\n\n*At this point you will be able to set the default options and you are in business.

Why do some sites think I'm using 11.2 while others think 15?\nUpdate:  I thought it might be because it looked at my user agent and knew I was using linux, so I switched it to\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:23.0) Gecko/20131011 Firefox/23.0\n\nbut that didn't work either.\n\nA: These are instructions for getting xfinity to work in Linux, without a VM or Playonlinux.

Adobe Flash version 15.0 was installed, and that solves the issues of watching xfinity in Firefox on Ubuntu.\nI \"downloaded\" and installed Firefox through the PlayOnLinux front-end when given the \"Choose and installation method\" option. It is listed when you click on the \"Internet\" icon. Make sure you DO NOT run Firefox at the end of its installation procedure, i.e Deselect \"Launch Firefox now.\" If you don't deselect it, Firefox won't install properly.\nInformation and helpful Manual on how to use PlayOnLinux can be found here:\nhttps://www.playonlinux.com/en/\nWhen Firefox is installed, it will show up in the PlayOnLinux program window pane. You can then lauch Firefox from there (or the desktop shortcut that may have been installed during the procedure), and enjoy watching xfinity.\nNote: I updated from the downloaded FF ver. 31 referenced above, to the latest ver. 34. That caused some problems in the Menu Bar. For some reason, clicking on a menu like \"Tools\" will display the drop-down menu, but clicking on items within the menu sometimes displays only a partial window, where the other part of the window is black.

So let's have a try: On my Ubuntu out-of-the-box machine, first I install necessary development package with headers:\nsudo apt-get install libxaw7-dev\n\nThen I need to tell ./configure script the correct location to these development files. On my machine this is /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. You get this from apt-cache show libxaw7. With this knowledge, call\n./configure --x-libraries=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n\n\nA: TL;DR: Install libxaw7-dev .\nIt appears you're building software from source code, and that the software you're building is not Xaw itself, but instead uses Xaw by linking against it.\nTo build software that links to a library, you must install the header files for that library (which is what your error message--\"Cannot find required Xaw header file Box.h\"--is telling you that you don't have).\nIn Ubuntu, header files are provided by separate packages, whose names end in -dev. In this case, you need libxaw7-dev . (You also need libxaw7 , but if you don't already have it, it will be installed automatically when you install the corresponding -dev package. In contrast, installing it will not automatically install its -dev package.)\nYou can install libxaw7-dev  in the Software Center, or by running:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libxaw7-dev\n\nWhile you don't have to install libxaw7 explicitly, you might wish to, so that it's not automatically removed if the -dev package is later uninstalled and no other package declares a dependency on it. (Generally speaking, the package manager doesn't know about software you've manually built and installed from source code.) If you wish to do that, replace the second line with:\nsudo apt-get install libxaw7-dev libxaw7\n\nOr just run sudo apt-get install libxaw or sudo apt-mark manual libxaw7, if you've already installed libxaw7-dev.\nIn the case of this particular library (libxaw7), it was easy to guess the name of the package that provides its header files libxaw7-dev. Sometimes, it's not so easy. In that case, or in general to find out what official Ubuntu package provides a file (whose filename you know), you can search the Ubuntu Packages Database, under \"Search the contents of packages.\"\nThis reveals that a number of packages provide files with that or a similar name. However, only one of the search results provides a header file for Xaw: libxaw7-dev (The file is /usr/include/X11/Xaw/Box.h.)\nThat search shows other related header files provided by two other related packages, which I believe you don't need, since your error message said \"Cannot find required Xaw header\" (and not Xaw3d or Xaw3dxft). However, in case you need those related libraries' Box.h files, they are provided by the xaw3dg-dev  and xpaint-dev  packages.\n", "Q: Why won't my system boot off of a partition that I just transferred the Ubuntu install image to using the dd command?

The WiFi networks appears as if it is very far, when, in reality, the router is near the laptop.\nIn case of Windows (on the same laptop), it works good. Also works fine in case of a tablet.\nFor the time being, I am using a USB WiFi adapter to get access to the web.\nMy card is a Broadcom BCM43142\nNetwork controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n (rev 01)\n\nI hope somebody can give me a viable solution.\n\nA: Here's a test. Take you laptop to a farther away location and see if the problem remains, say to the living room (if you're in your own room, for example), and see if you still show a weak signal. Weak metering in this case, does not always translate to weak signal.\nIf wifi performance remains good, then it may be just a meter scaling problem (my laptop rarely shows full-strength ever). Windows does not perform the metering, this is one of those proprietary driver issues that is solved by the manufacturer, they write the driver to please the customer, even when it reports loud and isn't . I always get 4 instead of the 5 bar reading, on my laptop.\nIf the wifi is working well, then the metering is just reading low, and there may be nothing wrong with it. I have found Ubuntu quirky that way. This is because they do very little in custom software for a given manufacturer. They tend to standardize. This is a good reason for some wifi to show loud, while others might show weak, or a little low (like on my laptop).\nHope that helps, have fun and good luck!\n\nA: OK, now we're getting somewhere.\n1). Since the wifi equipment in/attached to your laptop doesn't change, the performance should not either.\nSO the next thing we need to do is confirm performance, when on Windows. If you are using Ubuntu only, that now presents a nearly insurmountable problem.\nIf you are dual boot, I would recommend testing the wifi in Windows, and see if performance is roughly the same. Ignore the meter strength. The important thing is, does the wifi work about the same?\n2). If the actual performance is about the same, then nothing is wrong. As you suggest, router performance varies from unit to unit. And the position of the router in the house has a direct effect on how well it covers the ground. \nRemember, you are dealing with microwave frequencies, this means that while the companies that make routers say they  thing will work for several hundred yards; everything changes that performance. In microwave frequencies; metal, wood, and drywall stop radio waves. This means that the more stuff between your laptop and your router, the less signal you will get. We are talking about significant signal drop in many cases.\nA lot has to do with how large your house is. Multiple floors make things complicated, because this changes the antenna dynamics. Some people have 3,000 sq.ft. homes. This is a very big house, for a router to reach everywhere. In larger homes, one router is sometimes not enough.\nCentrally locating the router in the house will tend to feed the surrounding rooms more evenly. Sometimes a better router can expand the range. If you need to, don't be afraid to expand the wifi in your house with a 'range extender'. Many companies sell these and they're not drastically expensive.\nAnd lastly, it is obvious that the built-in wifi is very poorly constructed. Most USB plug-in wifi units don't work as well as built-in units because the built-in unit can make use of the space to include a big internal antenna (some even place the antenna in the screen, which presents a very large loop to the router, and most of it is vertically polarized, the same as the antennas in most routers). The USB types only have the length of the unit as space for the antenna (a couple of inches).\nYour situation means that either there is a problem with the wifi in the laptop or its internal antenna. You should not need a plug-in wifi unit. If your laptop is still in warranty, I'd insist on getting the wifi card and antenna replaced.\n3). In general, my take on this is that it is not a Ubuntu Linux problem. I think we are dealing with a general wifi problem, and because the metering reads differently, the problem seems more pronounced than it is. But it does require attention, since you lose signal at points in the house. Since it does work, and the equipment is the same, you'll need to work on the wifi network as a whole (deal with the poor wifi in the laptop, and/or expand the wifi system in the house, with either a stronger router, or more routers [extenders]).\nI hope you get this solved, wifi is the way to go with a laptop ! Have fun and good luck!\n", "Q: Login welcome message but no shell? I've created a user on my Ubuntu machine so that some people can log in and set up SSH tunnels and also so they can download some files from the system.\nI don't want them to have shell access at all. Even if they had it, they wouldn't know what to do with it.\nI can set their PuTTY clients not to request a shell, however if I do this, they enter their password and nothing comes up. They have absolutely no indication whether the login was successful or not unless they start trying to use the tunnels.\nAlso, this is disabling the shell on the client side rather than the server side, which I'm not too fond of.\nWhat's the best way to maintain SSH tunneling and file downloading capacity while preventing the user from seeing a shell, but still giving them some welcome message upon login?\nCan I just write a bash script, for example, that echos out \"Welcome\", and set that as their shell?\n\nA: According to this page you can set the users' login shell to /sbin/nologin and they will still be able to use port forwarding and other, non-shell authentication. \nYou may need to tweak your server configuration, see the linked page for more details.\n", "Q: New account showed up (named \"postgres\") why? I was about to shut down my laptop and noticed the user account called \"postgres\" showed up. I don't know the password and I didn't create it (meaning hit a create new account button to my knowledge). The only things I've installed recently are metasploit, nmap and Gnumeric Spreadsheet. I'm understandably confused and would love if people could get me some answers, or at least the password :)\n\nA: I am no Metasploit expert, but this guide says that it uses PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL, like many other services on Ubuntu (like Apache, nginx, MySQL, nslcd, etc.), runs a daemon as a separate user. This helps in security. Login should be disabled for this user by default (so, no password).\nThe PostgreSQL account shouldn't be visible on LightDM (it should be using an UID outside the normal range of visibility on LightDM) so you could consider filing a bug.\n\nA: Postgres is an open source database management system, which Metasploit uses for its database. As a result, during the installation, a new 'postgres' user was created.\nBecause I don't know how Metasploit was installed, I don't know what was set as the password. If the extra user account is bothersome, you can always hide the account using this method.\n\nA: The user is created by postgresqlon which one of your programs depend. Its no problem that you have an extra user on your machine, in fact you'll have several such users for various purposes on your computer. These users generally dont have a password because usually no one interactively logs into the user account. If you want to use that account for some reason, you can do a sudo su - postgres. \nYou can hide this user from the login screen by doing a sudo usermod -u 800 postgres. (Any value under 1000 will suffice).\n", "Q: Why is my machine shutting down overnight? The last two nights I have left my computer on overnight and then gone to work when I woke up.

Why isn't this included with the source files from Python.org, or if it is, how can I find it to complete the upgrade? Am I missing steps or another package?\n\nA: If you think easy_install has anything to do with upgrading the python interpreter itself, my answer is: don't do it. easy_install is a script that installs or upgrades additional python packages - not python itself ... and in almost all cases it is better to use pip for that for quite some years already.\nThe preinstalled python 2.x and 3.x are heavily used by the system itself and have exactly the version that the system needs. Upgrades of the python version are done by the system if necessary, as part of the normal system updates.\nIf you need a different python version for development it should be kept separate from the python used by the system. You usually use virtualenv for that. There is a good description how to do that in an virtualenv in a stackoverflow question\nIf you need a newer version of Python itself, than what the system offers I would recommend using pyenv for easy installation of additional Python versions in userspace.\n", "Q: Running Questasim in Ubuntu I tried to install Questasim 10.2 in Ubuntu 14.4 32 bit.Everything was ok.But when I tried to run the Questasim it is showing an error\nbash: ./vsim: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error\n\nHow this problem can be solved??\n\nA: This error happens when you execute a 64-bit executable in a 32-bit operating system.

I want to explore the possibility of installing trusty packages on it by replacing the repository list in /etc/apt/sources.list to 14.04 repositories. I know it probably sounds like a bad idea but nonetheless - will this work? Is it safe?\n\nA: It'll work but it's not that safe in terms of stability; you might end up with broken packages. However, you'd pretty much be doing an upgrade to 14.04 because, as soon as your system does the first software update, the 14.04 counterparts of all your installed 12.04 packages and applications will update to the newest version available by default, versions from 14.04, unless specified otherwise.\nYou might find it useful to know that an upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 can be done via live disk without overwriting all your data as a full system install used to. You now have the option to upgrade your existing installation. \nAlternatively, you  could run the following command from a terminal to do the upgrade to 14.04 that way:\nsudo do-release-upgrade \n\nAlso, there are some differences in the filesystem structure from 12.04 to 14.04 that can cause conflicts without performing a complete upgrade.\n", "Q: Run winword.exe I have dual boot with windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04.

It requires access to registry values and other data in your local settings to even start, which are in the Windows registry.\nWINE has its own registry and \"hard drive\" with local data.\n", "Q: No 100% Memory Usage I've 4 GiB RAM, and System Monitor shows 3.8 GiB. I think 200 MiB is for GPU. But I've never seen Memory usage more than 3.0 GiB. If memory usage is close to 3 GiB, it uses Swap, and when it reaches to 3 GiB computer freezes (I'm using Idea IDE). \nI've disabled vm.swappiness (with swapoff -a). Didn't help. Then tried swappiness=0, swappiness=1, swappiness=20. \nWhen I added extra 4 GiB, I saw memory usage 5 GiB. Now I've only 4 GiB RAM.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04. Why System Monitor doesn't show 3.7 or 3.8 GiB memory usage? \n\nA: If you disable swappiness, your RAM will get more full. If you increase swappiness, the data in RAM will get paged out to the swap partition when your ram reaches a certain level. Ram will get full but it's not always a problem. If you really want to do something about it, you can run the following command to clear your cash:\n(warning: If you have installed profile-sync-daemon, close firefox and run the command sudo service psd stop before you run the following command!) \necho \"3\" | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nThis will clear your cash even though most of the time it's not necessary especially if swappiness is enabled. People are usually alarmed when they see high RAM usage on a linux desktop but the developers insist that the system will actually run faster because what is in the ram is cached data that can easily and quickly be retrieved by the system. When the system is in heavy use, those cached files get transfered to swap.\n\nThe reason you don't see as much RAM in use as before is because Linux is designed to most efficiently make use of and take advantage of the available system resources. So, if you had 12GB of RAM you might see 8 or even 9GB of RAM use instead. Alot of the RAM in use is used for caching and is not usually necessary to run the immediate \ndesktop.\nAs for the system showing 3GB of RAM in use, run the following command and you should get a more accurate number:\nfree\n\nsystem-monitor says I'm using 1.4GB of RAM and the actual RAM in use including buffers/cache is 2.7GB, almost twice the reported figure. This number is often much higher as the cache will sometimes grow to more than 50% of the total. Also, system monitor reports my total RAM at 4.7 when the actual number is closer to 4.9GB.\n\nTo help diagnose your issue you can install htop and iotop to get a better idea of what's going on when you have problems. To install:\nsudo apt-get install iotop htop\n\nTo run:\nsudo iotop\n\nor \nsudo htop\n\nFrom my own experience I've always achieved better system performance using swap and have run into problems (system freezes) when swap is disabled. In fact, this is most likely why your computer freezes. Without swap, the system has no way to continue using RAM after becoming full. Turning swappiness down too low can also cause excessive paging and thrashing of the hard drive if have alot of RAM in use. This problem will sometimes show up as excessive kworker activity using iotop.\n\nA: This tool is not including disk cache in what it is reporting as \"free\".  Your system is swapping in order to maintain a reasonably sized disk cache.\nPlease see my answer to this question for more information.  Here's an excerpt:\n\nEach application can use some of your memory. Linux uses all otherwise unoccupied memory (except for the last few Mb) as \"cache\". This includes the page cache, inode caches, etc. This is a good thing - it helps speed things up heaps. Both writing to disk and reading from disk can be sped up immensely by cache.\nIdeally, you have enough memory for all your applications, and you still have several hundred Mb left for cache. In this situation, as long as your applications don't increase their memory use and the system isn't putting too much pressure on the cache, there is no need for any swap.\nOnce applications claim more RAM, it simply goes into some of the space that was used by cache, shrinking the cache. De-allocating cache is cheap and easy enough that it is simply done in real time - everything that sits in the cache is either just a second copy of something that's already on disk, so can just be deallocated instantly, or it's something that we would have had to flush to disk within the next few seconds anyway, thus there is zero performance hit in re-allocating cache to applications.\nSo, when someone refers to \"free\" RAM, this may or may not include cache, since cache will only occupy \"free\" RAM. This is not a situation that is specific to Linux - all modern operating systems work this way. The different operating systems might just report free RAM differently: some include the cache as part of what they consider \"free\" and some may not.\nWhen you talk about free RAM, it's a lot more meaningful to include cache, because it practically is free - it's available should any application request it. On Linux, the free command reports it both ways - the first line includes cache in the used RAM column, and the second\n\n...\n\nOnce you have used up enough memory that there is not enough left for a smooth-running cache, Linux may re-allocate some unused application memory from RAM to swap in order to regain some memory for cache.\nIt doesn't do this according to a definite cutoff though. It's not like you reach a certain percentage of allocation then Linux starts swapping. It has a rather \"fuzzy\" algorithm. It takes a lot of things into account, which can best be described by \"how much pressure is there for memory allocation\". If there is a lot of \"pressure\" to allocate new memory, then it will increase the chances some will be swapped to make more room. If there is less \"pressure\" then it will decrease these chances.\n\nNote: what I said above applies not just to Linux but to virtually all modern computer operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, etc.\n\nA: You can change or modify de value of the parameter vm.min_free_kbyte in /etc/sysctl.conf \nThis controls the amount of memory that is kept free for use by special reserves including “atomic” allocations (those which cannot wait for reclaim).\nYou can set a small value and see how it goes.\nYou can see more information in this post.\n", "Q: Evolution Mail and Calendar Authentication Error I am having a problem in adding my gmail id in Evolution Mail and Calendar.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr\nWine 1.6.2\nWindows Installer (msiexec) 4.5.6001.22299\nOverdrive Media Console is a Windows application running on Windows XP SP3 or later.  Overdrive is used by lending libraries to lend ebook, audio, and video files, but only to registered members of a library.  There is no Ubuntu package.\nI downloaded the ODMediaConsoleSetup.msi file from http://app.overdrive.com/, saved it, and made it executable.  Then I ran Wine thus:\n$ wine msiexec /i ODMediaConsoleSetup.msi\nfixme:storage:create_storagefile Storage share mode not implemented.\nerr:msi:ITERATE_Actions Execution halted, action L\"VSDCA_VsdLaunchConditions\" returned 1603\n\nAfter googling I could not find any references to my problem.  Has anybody been here before and succeeded in installing Overdrive?\nRegards,\nHedley\n\nA: I had the same problem until I used winecfg to change the Windows version from XP to Win 7. The installer ran and I was then able to download an MP3 audiobook.\n\nA: I loaded the \"Windows Desktop\" version into PlayonLinux and got good results.\nYou'll have too choose [Install] and then [Install non-listed Program].\nThen you'll choose [Install a program in a new virtual drive] then name it \"Overdrive\" or whatever you want.  Check the boxes for [Use another version of Wine]  and [Install some libraries]. You'll need to install wine 1.4 if you don't have it. \nTo install wine 1.4 go to the main Playonlinux window and choose [tools] from the top menu and then [Manage Wine Versions]\nAfter choosing wine 1.4 you'll pick \"32 bit windows installation\" and next. In the next window you'll see a list of add-ons that start with \"POL_\" you want to scroll down almost to the bottom and look for \"POL_Install_wmp10\" this will install windows media player 10 which is the backend of the OMC. Now you'll need to download the \"Windows Desktop\" version of OverDrive Media Console if you haven't already from http://app.overdrive.com/images/windows-phone-store.png\nchoose [select another file] [next] and then [Browse] and once you've picked your downloaded file (ODMediaConsoleSetup.msi] and opened it you're done. \nAlso if you don't like playonlinux you can used this method.

It is so slow that writing this post and right clicking in a word for corrector to work takes 10 secs to show the menu and mouse pointer teleports when I move it.\nNow that I have closed VirtualBox is much better so I think the problem may come from there.\nVirtualBox is 4.3.10_ubuntu and the VM is Win7 with \"Use 3d acceleration\" marked.\nBut since htop is not showing considerable CPU usage, what do you think could be the cause of this?\n\n\nA: VirtualBox is using far too much RAM for your system, and you are swapping constantly. \nI retouched the image to make it visible: \n\nVirtualBox have a virtual memory requirement that are almost the same size of your physical RAM.\nHow much memory have you dedicated to the virtual machine? In my experience, everything that goes more than 1/3 of your total physical RAM is asking for troubles and slowdowns.\nThe java process under it could be also part of the problem (it's at 2.8G!) --- chances are that VirtualBox and that process are competing for RAM and livelock together swapping like crazy. \nMore detailed: that the Virtual Size is the memory the process has \"mapped\", that is, the memory it thinks it has --- only part of that is really in RAM at any moment, and that part is the one marked with RES (for resident). If the program tries to access memory which is in its virtual pool but not in RAM, and the memory is full, some other memory must be swapped out to make place for the new one. \nSo if you have two process with a big difference between Virtual and Resident memory, chances are that the two are swapping out the other one at every scheduling switch --- making the system slow to a crawl --- swap memory can be millions of time slower than RAM.  \nThe fact that it happens after a long period of inactivity is probably due the fact that the system has settled on a partition of the RAM among the process that more or less satisfy all of them for that workload. When you change the kind of workload again, different part of the programs are loaded, and the swap frenzy starts. Chances are that if you wait the necessary time (could be hours!) the system will more or less find another decent equilibrium; it's the transitory which is bad. \nAbout your case: \nWith 4G of RAM, having a virtual machine of 1.5G is ok, if it's the only memory hungry process in the system. Probably that one and the IDE are too much. \nDirty (and dangerous) Trick\nTo have back a responsive system, the faster way I know is to force swap off; but this is quite dangerous sometime. The basic idea is to do a \nsudo swapoff -a\n\nwait for finishing...\nsudo swapon -a\n\nThis will try to put all the memory back in RAM. If it can't, processes will be unmercifully killed along the way. To avoid the death of  some innocent and important system process(1) the best way is to try to close the memory-hog before doing the swapoff. \n\n(1) the OOM (out-of-memory) killer of the kernel will try to kill the correct processes, but it's not failproof. \n", "Q: Fastest way to check for bad sectors in HDD? I have a bunch of disks, probably 50 or more laying there, I know some of them are broken and some should still work fine, I need a way to check them without wasting days.\nDo you know any tools besides badblocks, that can do it without taking too much time?\n\nA: For those who find this question looking for a solution to the badblocks error Value too large for defined data type (as you might get trying to scan a 6TB drive): try setting larger block size:\nbadblocks -b 4096 /dev/sde\n\n\nA: If your drives have SMART, I would go about this by installing \"gsmartcontrol\" and doing a short test on all drives. Then throw away the ones that do not even pass the short test or display errors/warnings and perform a long test on the remaining drives.\nTo truly find out if a drive is damaged or not, I guess you will need to check every sector of it and that's what the long test does.\nBut I am no expert, maybe there is a better way?\n\nA: You have to check some SMART utilities. \nYou can use \"Disk Utility\" (aka palimpsest or gnome-disks depending on the Ubuntu release) for this.\nIn command line I suggest you install the smartmontools package (sudo apt install smartmontools) and play around with smartctl.\nExample:\nsudo smartctl --all /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: Will the updates mirrored to my local repository get deleted after upgradation? I have mirrored ubuntu repository to my local through apt-mirror tool. A cronjob is set to sync everyday. \nMy doubt is , are the updates which are there in my local will get removed if its removed from ubuntu archive.\n\nA: The apt-mirror configuration can include an optional clean section, which tells apt-mirror to look for files which can be deleted. If you have such a section, it will generate a script called clean.sh in the var directory, which you must manually \nrun for files to be deleted.\nSo the packages will be deleted if:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have a clean section in your mirror.list\n\n*You run the generated clean.sh script.\n\n\nIf you have enabled clean, then the output of apt-mirror will include something like the following towards the end:\n3.2 GiB in 429 files and 0 directories can be freed.\nRun /var/spool/apt-mirror/var/clean.sh for this purpose.\n\n", "Q: Add external library to Ubuntu App in Ubuntu SDK I am trying to add the QuaZip library to my project (https://launchpad.net/vadetux).

It has no purpose for Ubuntu, as it is a feature used by the junk that is Windows to prevent firmware from being altered by malware.\n1). Make sure you run the \"Recovery Backup Tool\" present on all newer Windows systems. This will produce a set of DVD's which can rebuild the entire system to factory fresh state. Normally you may need from 2-5 DVD's, depending on the manufacturer.\nThis tool has differing names because each manufacturer calls it something else. I would prefer they call it \"Systems Recovery Tool\" and standardize this mess. At the entry point in the \"RUN\" Charm , type 'recovery' and you should see the tool listed in the output.\nPlease make sure you have a backup of your personal files, so that you can move them to Ubuntu.\n2). You can then use the Live Install DVD of 14.04 to install Ubuntu. Just select the option to replace everything on the drive with Ubuntu. This will erase and consolidate all partitions on the drive, reparation the drive for Ubuntu, then install Ubuntu.\nMake sure you click-on the check-boxes for 3rd party drivers, and extra packages and any additional updates from the Internet (making sure you are on the Internet before you install, by signing onto your WIFI if required, from the Live-DVD).

The next thing that happened was that another download began (which I had directed to be downloaded into the Partition where I wanted to install the Software. Mine is Windows XP, with Four partitioned Disk each 40 GB. The second download mentioned took about four hrs and a half (nearly 2.6 GB) and when the end point neared an error occurred and I could not do anything further. I note that all the files are installed somewhere in my Computer. But I am not able to get at te destination. How do I proceed? Please Help\nThank you\n\nA: Here's how to install Ubuntu 14.04.1 using Wubi.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the ISO and wubi.exe from http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.1\n\n*Place the two items in the same directory with no other ISOs (is the best)\n\n*Disconnect from the internet (or else wubi will reject the ISO)\n\n*Run Wubi and install normally, but don't restart your computer.\n\n*Reconnect to the internet and reboot your computer (otherwise your wifi card may remain disabled)\n\n\nYou have to do this offline because otherwise it downloads the wrong md5sum and fails the ISO and then downloads another. I didn't bother going through the process to see why that fails. \nOnce you've rebooted and the installation is completed, it won't boot though due to another weirdness since 14.04. You have to edit the grub entry first. Wubi suppresses the display of the Grub menu, so hold down the Shift key after selecting Ubuntu and then follow the instructions here: Ubuntu 14.04 not booting after error message. /tmp could not be mounted\nFor this (and other issues) I recommend not using Wubi. But if you want to, that's how.\nP.S. Because you're skipping the md5sum check, there is a risk that your ISO download is corrupted or incomplete and this can lead to failures. Depending on the reliability of your internet connection you may wish to manually verify the md5sum yourself.\n", "Q: re-direct /Documents to a folder on a ubuntu server I hope this is an easy task to implement basically I 'need' to point the currently logged in user's documents,etc to a folder on the server. I know this an easy task on a windows server and client through group policy.\n\nA: Just mount the network share on the Documents folder\nMove any existing docs out of the local user Documents folder first.\nThen add this to fstab\nserver.local:/srv/user/Documents /home/user/Documents  nfs  _netdev,auto 0 0\n\nChange server.local to a valid dns name of your server.\nTell it to do the mounts now\nmount -a\n\nNow your local Documents folder points to your server location.\nYou would need your nfs server in place first, and nfs-tools installed locally.\nThis is a manual way to do it for one user on one workstation.  For multiple users or a generic version you'll need something smarter using LDAP or NSS.\n", "Q: How can I have Wicd connect to my wireless network without having to enter a password? In the context of my earlier deleted question below:\n\nEverytime I run WICD (Network Manager) it requires my password for\n  permission. I'm not against Ubuntu asking for passwords in general but\n  everytime I log in is a little excessive. Is there a way to whitelist\n  a program? I'm running what is based off of Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit\n\nMy main goal is making it so I do not have to enter my password on startup in order to use WIFI. I was advised to use sudoers file (How do I run specific sudo commands without a password?), but I don't know exactly how to use it or where WICD is located for it. My first attempt did not work.\nIs it the right approach or am I missing something?\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: I assume that you're using the wicd-gtk package. It has two programs in /usr/bin:\n/usr/bin/wicd-client\n/usr/bin/wicd-gtk\n\nThe first is a wrapper for the second (and wicd-cli). \nwicd-gtk recommends gksu, and the Arch Wiki suggests that it might use graphical sudo programs. So I think this problem can be solved using an appropriate NOPASSWD line in sudoers, since pkexec isn't involved.\nYou can add a file to /etc/sudoers.d with contents similar to (doctorow being your username):\ndoctorow ALL  = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wicd-client, /usr/bin/wicd-gtk\n\nThe accepted answer to How do I run specific sudo commands without a password? has the steps required to create such a file.\n\nA: You shouldn't run wicd-client as root.  It is designed to run as a normal user.  There is a daemon which runs as root and should always be running.  This will do anything that the client needs which requires root access.\nIf the daemon is not running when you start the client then you will be asked for your password and the client will attempt to start the daemon.  The client will then continue to run as a normal user.  While this works, it is not recommended.  Configure your system to start the daemon at boot, although this should have been done when you installed the wicd-daemon package.\nYou should also get in the habit of reading the instructions when a dialog asks for your password.  Wicd will tell you what it wants the password for.  If you're trying to run as root then don't.  If it wants to start a daemon then that's where you should look for your problems.  Inside Wicd, you can configure the program used to ask for root permissions from the preferences dialog.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS does not start desktop I have never worked with Linux before.

Do you get a username@machinename:~$ prompt after that message? If so, try to enter this command:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nAfter it prompts for password, enter your password.\n", "Q: Can't update Firefox I've downloaded an update for Firefox which is now in my Downloads folder.

However, that document has a garbled structure, it's not clear which sections apply to the current Mac Pro and which to a previous generation, it doesn't mention video resolutions, and so does not come close to answering my questions.\nSupplementary information that would useful includes whether 4k video can be achieved using free drivers, or whether proprietary drivers are required to reach that resolution.\n3d performance is not important here.  This will be used as a 2d workstation running a traditional window manager.\n\nA: Theoretically, yes.\nHowever, you will need to install the ATI graphics cards for this. Just use the \"Proprietary Hardware\" tool in the system settings panel. See this part of the Wiki for a bit more info.\nWhen the drivers have installed and you have rebooted, set the resolution and enjoy!\n", "Q: Nautilus Thumbnails Size Fix Nautilus displays thumbnails very small when I have it set to 200% icon zoom in icon mode. I would prefer to have 5 columns of icons like this, but with larger picture and video icons:\n\nWhen I set the icon zoom level to 400%, the thumbnail size is better, I only get 2 columns of icons on a 1080p screen!!\n\nIs there any other way to increase the thumbnail sizes to take up proper screen space while keeping at least 5 columns of icons on the screen? To explain, you can see how much the 2nd image is wasting space in nautilus.\n\nA: The following commands fix the problem without installing additional software. It worked great for me on RHEL 7.2 at least:\ndconf write /org/gnome/nautilus/icon-view/thumbnail-size 128\nnautilus -q\nrm -r ~/.cache/thumbnails/\n\n\nA: I have found a very simple solution to this problem.\nAfter a single change, the above folder now looks like this when set to 200% icon zoom level:\n\nIt was as simple as changing the \"thumbnail-size\" value in \"dconf-editor\" for nautilus to a larger value.\nTo apply the change, make sure \"dconf-editor\" is installed in your system by typing the following into a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nAfter installing, type Alt - F2 to pull up the command dialogue, and type \"dconf-editor\" to search for it and click on it.\nOnce you have \"dconf-editor\" open, navigate to the following location in the left pane:\norg > gnome > nautilus > icon-view\n\nSee this example image for the location:\n\nThe value that needs changed is the \"thumbnail-size\" value. I changed it from a default of 64 to 128. Depending on your display resolution, you may need to change it to a different value to make things look exactly the way you want. Smaller displays might need a value larger than 64, but 128 might be to large, so try something like 96.\nOnce that value is changed, exit \"dconf-editor\". Now the thumbnail cache needs to be cleared to allow that changes to take effect.\nFirst close all Nautilus windows, then type the following code in a terminal (each line is a separate command).\nnautilus -q\nsudo rm -r ~/.cache/thumbnails/\n\nThe first command makes sure Nautilus is closed, and the second clears your thumbnail cache.\nNote that this does not affect file or folder icons. Those will still appear to be smaller than the picture and video icons generated by Nautilus (or more correctly generated by ffmpegthumbnailer). This is still a huge improvement for thumbnails in Nautilus even with this shortcoming.\nThis fix worked on Ubuntu 14.04.1.\n", "Q: How to remove completely the php packages from ondrej PPA?

I know the ISO is uncorrupted. However, when I start my laptop, it gives the option to boot to Ubuntu, but it tells me there's an error and makes me restart.\n\nA: Skylar, please advise how you are performing this. I'm on my phone, so I will refine at a later date. \nStep 1- Create the partition in Windows. \nIn your Window's 8  OS, right click on Computer, select manage and go to disk management. From here, create the desired partition for Linux- try to make a minimum of 20GB. \nStep 2- Burn the ISO \nThere are several tools in which you can use, I would recommend using RUFUS to perform this. Now in regards to the iso file, I would recommend using one of the later Linux versions- e.g. Ubuntu 14.04. \nIf you do use RUFUS, select MBR or UEFI for Secure Boot machines. Once the iso has been burned to the USB, reboot the machine and boot to USB; either edit this in your Bios or manually select it. To manually select it you will need to go to the boot manager; this is usually achieved by pressing F12 on boot. \nStep 3- Installation\nFrom here, complete the setup as desired. When it comes to the disk selection, ensure you select something else and then install to your partition. You'll just need to make \"/\", and a swap area, plus whatever else you need. You should not need an EFI boot section as it will write to the Windows MBR, but if you're really worried you can dedicate 100mb to this.\nIf you're unsure of any of the steps, please let me know.  Here are some links to help:\nHere is a quick link to my blog where I have complete a guide and referenced other guides: http://bit.ly/1s4oceI\nHere is the link to the issues I have had with, where you may find some useful comments: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Install Issues\nLastly, I would highly recommend you reading this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/228069/212930\nIf I've taken your question in the wrong direction please let me know.

Just a foreword, this is my first foray into anything Linux related. Please forgive me if my lingo isn't up to par.\nI just installed Ubuntu 14.04 last night. After I removed the installation disk (when I was prompted to do such) and restarted, the computer started up and I was eventually prompted to put in my passphrase. After that was successfully accepted, the screen went black but my cursor still showed up and I was able to move it around. I tried ctrl+alt+del but to no avail. A few minutes of just the screen led to: \n[121.855415] nouveau E[    DRM] GPU lockup - switch to software fbcon\n\n[142.180021] nouveau E[Xorg[1254]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0001 [Xorg[1254]]\n\nWith that second line repeating but with different numbers in the brackets. So I looked around for people in similar situations and found that most people went to GRUB and added\n\"nomodeset\" after quiet splash. However, I couldn't figure out how to deal with the $vt_handoff that was present right after \"quiet splash\" in GRUB. So, I just stuck nomodeset after $vt_handoff and hit ctrl+X. \nAfter the encryption prompt working successfully (as it has every time), I was actually brought to the desktop screen. I thought I had fixed the situation when a problem report window popped up asking me to support the bug report and the screen went fuzzy. It made it difficult for me to document what the bug report contained but I was able to make some stuff out: \nExecutable path\n\n  /usr/bin/Xorg\n\nPackage\n\n  Xserver-xorg-Core 2: 1.15.1-0ubuntu2\n\nProblemType\n\n  Crash\n\nTitle \n\n  Xorg crashed with SIGABRT\n\nApport Version \n\n  2.14.1-0ubuntu3.2\n\nArchitecture\n\n  Amd64\n\nAt this point, it was difficult to discern what was in the report. Moving the cursor around somehow caused the screen to look better for a bit but scrolling down through report made things difficult again. \nI restarted again after that to see that I'm back to a black screen with the cursor which leads me to believe that \"nomodeset\" did not stick and I'll have to reapply it. \nThe computer with the problems is a Dell Dimension E521 with BIOS 1.1.11. I did the 64-Bit install from a Live Disc while using Windows XP. \nDoes anybody have an idea what to do? If you guys needs more info on the computer, I'll get is ASAP. Thank you. \n\nA: To make nomodeset permanent edit the file /etc/default/grub using one of those:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+F2 and then write gksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*In a terminal sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nchange GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\" and finally run sudo update-grub2 (this will regenerate the grub entries).\nRegarding the bug report window, if it gets annoying you can disable it using one of the methods above to edit /etc/default/apport and changing enabled to 0.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Studio 14.04 - login profile pic cannot be changed I have recently performed a fresh install of Ubuntu Studio 14.04.

Why did Ubuntu skip letters in the 1st four release names for Ubuntu?\nThe story of the 1st release being named \"Warty Warthog\", because it lacked polish, is well know, but why didn't they continue alphabetically from there?\nHere are the 1st four releases:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"W\"... Ubuntu 4.10 - Warty Warthog\n\n*\"H\"... Ubuntu 5.04 - Hoary Hedgehog\n\n*\"B\"... Ubuntu 5.10 - Breezy Badger\n\n*\"D\"... Ubuntu 6.06 LTS - Dapper Drake\n\n\nThey skipped to \"H\" for the 2nd Ubuntu release, instead of continuing with the next letter, \"X\".\nThen skipped to \"B\" for the 3rd Ubuntu release, instead of continuing with the next letter, \"I\", or even starting at the beginning with \"A\".\nThey skipped \"C\" entirely for the 4th Ubuntu release and jumped to the letter \"D\".\nAfter Dapper Drake, every release has been consistently named with the next letter of the alphabet.\n\nA: After the first four it made sense to go in order. \n\nFor all of our sanity we are going to try to keep these names alphabetical after Breezy. We might skip letters, and we'll have to wrap eventually. But the naming convention is here for a while longer, at least. The possibilities are endless. Gregarious Gnu? Antsy Aardvark? Phlegmatic Pheasant? You send 'em, we'll consider 'em.\n  - Mark Shuttleworth\n\nSo if you look at things like the infrastructure, Launchpad, etc. it's easy to see what \"order\" things were released in when they're in alphabetical order. If we skipped around it'd be impossible to tell what came before and after what. \nAt the time it also became easier to reference the future animal as a letter without having to know exactly what it was called, so we could do things like schedule the developer summit under \"uds-m\" (for example). \n", "Q: ForcePAE for Linux Live on Pentium M on memory stick I'm a Windows user with moderate skills. I've set a couple of minimal (\"grandmother\") users on Ubuntu when old XP installations got too tangled with age.

Is there a way for a busy person to be able to put an item on my iCloud Calendar and have the event added to a main KOrganizer calendar automatically, and vice versa?\n\nA: Here is how I did this, thanks to the advice from @Khurshid_Alam:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an iCloud CloudDav discovery program called icloud\nfrom its GitHub page.\n\n*Extract icloud-master/groovy_java/gui-2.0.1.zip. (Be sure to read the README as apparently there are legal issues...)\n\n*Run icloud-master/groovy_java/gui-2.0.1/bin/gui.\n\n*Type in Apple ID Credentials and select a server. Any server will work. Click \"Get calendar URLs\".\n\n*Click the URL on the far right next to the name of the main Calendar, Ctrl+C to copy it.\n\n*In KOrganizer, right click your calendar folder display (by default it is on the bottom left) and select Add Calendar.\n\n*Click \"DAV Groupware Resource\". Enter in your Apple ID credentials, select the \"Configure the resource manually\".\n\n*Allow access to the wallet, if the window comes up, and if applicable.\n\n*A new window will come up with \"Server configuration\" at the bottom. Click \"Add\" to the right of it, paste the copied URL into the \"Remote URL\" box, and click \"Fetch\". When you click \"OK\", the calendar will be added and automatic uploading and downloading of calendar data will be possible.\n\n*Have fun!\n\n\nA: This worked in August 2019:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Calendar App on iCloud.com or iPhone\n\n*Make calendar public to check the direct link to the server.

I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and I always installed every update needed.\nBut, I have a question now: I'm using Firefox now, and I can watch without any problem any video from youtube, for example. But, I didn't install the Adobe Flash Player (that firefox keeps asking me to install that)\nI already searched for other answers, but since they were answered years ago, then I thing I'm going to ask for more updated information.\nSo, do I have to install it? Never had any problems with that.\nThank you guys for helping me.\n\nA: Adobe Flash player is proprietary. Check boxes for proprietary software in Software and Updates setting, and then go to Software Center , and look for it there. Also install QuickJava addon in Firefox (type in address bar about:addons). This will help you to easily enable Java and Flash in Firefox. This is my usual set up in Ubuntu. Also, if you don't need flash for anything but YouTube,  just use HTML 5 plugins from Firefox - that's what I do on Fedora. \nAnother alternative is Google Chrome or Chromium browsers. They come with pepper-flash player, which is a variation of Adobe's.  And it's going to be supported too.\n", "Q: Best underlying file system type and configuration for HDFS I would like to reformat a local drive partition and turn it into a partition for HDFS. Which file system would be most performant for running HDFS on top of it? Any optimizations I should take care of for this file system?\nThis is an Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: Here are the best practices:\nBest Practices\nExecutive summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*ext3 is most tested and reliable\n\n*ext4/xfs are less tested, but offer performance benefits\n\n\nA: I would not recommend ext3. It has framentation issues. \nGiven HDFS normally operates with huge files on top of an OS filesystem, ext4 will be a much better option. ext4 organizes space into contiguous extents (chunks of adjacent blocks). So there is much less overhead of mapping tiny blocks into huge blocks. ext4 is also less suspecious for fragmentation.\nWhile XFS seems have similar features as ext4, my tests (although not for hdfs workloads) show it is infrerior to ext4 in some scenarios (like deleting a lot of files etc). \nWhile it is recommended to have a reserved space for ext3 to have less framentation. By default it is 5%, see \nsudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdb1 | grep 'Reserved block count'\n\nSo you lose 5% of HDFS space right there.\nFor ext4 you can put reserved space to 1% or even 0% (switch if off).\nYou can not be wrong with ext4 for HDFS.\nSome other recommended options for ext4:\n\n\n*\n\n*-noatime (mount option)\n\n*-tune2fs (to turn off reserved blocks)\n\n\nSomebody also recommends to turn off delayed allocation in ext4, but I would not do that without some testing.\n", "Q: How can I view thumbnails of pictures? How can I copy the attributes of the pictures folder so that \nI can view thumbnails of pictures on, for example, network drives?\n\nA: This is just a setting in Nautilus.  The default setting are designed to improve network performance.  However, you can change Nautilus to display preview thumbnails of remote image files...\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus\n\n*From the menubar, select Edit\n\n*Select Preferences\n\n*In the File Preferences dialog, Click on the Preview tab\n\n*From the Files drop down, make sure \"Always\" is selected, instead of \"Local Files Only\"\n\n*Optional: You might want to change the maximum file size that thumbnail previews are shown for\n\n\nUpdate for Ubuntu 20.04 (Nautilus 3.36)\n\n*\n\n*Click the menu button in the header bar\n\n*Click \"Preferences\"\n\n*The \"Preferences\" dialog will appear\n\n*Click the \"Search & Preview\" tab\n\n*In the \"Thumbnails\" section, select \"All files\" radio button\n\n*Optionally select the file size to generate thumbnails for, using the \"Only for files smaller than\" spinner.\n\n*Close the \"Preferences\" dialog\n\n\n\nA: I couldn't find the \"edit\" menu from PJ Singh's answer, but adapting it to the command line worked for me:\ndconf write /org/gnome/nautilus/preferences/show-image-thumbnails '\"always\"'\n\nNote the double quoting: it seems dconf wants a quoted string.

Windows is no longer needed. \nThe partition is mounted in Ubuntu and its files accessible to Ubuntu, but as mentioned no longer needed. How can I most safely go about this? \nAnd also, Will this consequentially screw up the boot process?\nTo the point of boot - the machine started as Windows 7, then had Ubuntu 12 installed via Wubi, later Wubi was discarded of and the Ubuntu partition became a regular Ubuntu partition. The machine is still dual boot, but as mentioned Windows will no longer be needed.\n\nA: OK, if I understand you correctly, you're dual-booted from a single partition (old fashiond after 13.04 or so). Does't really matter. The task is done the same.\n1). Use the 'create recovery disk' tool every Windows system comes with (each manufacturer calls it something different).This will create a copy of the emergency restore partition already present on your drive. This will require 2-5 DVD's, depending on the manufacturer.\nWith these DVD's in hand, the task of erasing your drive and recreating your Win7 system to factory fresh state (down the road) becomes trivial.\n2). Boot your DVD which contains your Ubuntu 14.04, and use it to install again. Then instruct the installer to wipe the drive and install using the entire drive.\nAfter the install, set up Ubuntu with your old sign-on and then re-install any apps, then copy your personal files from a backup.\nHope that helps, have fun and good luck!\n", "Q: Fail when update system I get in some trouble when I tried to update the system\nW: Failed to fetch http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/dists/trusty-getdeb/apps/binary-amd64/Packages  521  Origin Down [IP: 104.28.24.125 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/dists/trusty-getdeb/apps/binary-i386/Packages  521  Origin Down [IP: 104.28.24.125 80]\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

After reading an article about how cool can SSH be, I tried the solution given there about tunneling your connection.\nThis is the very first time I try this.\nI've opened a terminal and typed:\nssh -D 9999 -C myUsername@localhost\n\nAnd I've got this message:\n\nPrivileged ports can only be forwarded by root.\n\nSo I started again, this time, with sudo:\nsudo ssh -D 9999 -C root@localhost\n\nBut I still cannot acces. This is the message that I've received this time:\n\nssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused\n\nWhat Am I doing wrong?\n\nA: A simple tunnel is more usually done as\nssh -L 8080:localhost:80 myUsername@remoteserver.com\n\n\n*\n\n*-L = local port forward, ie from where I am to where I'm going\n\n*8080 = port on this machine to forward. The port my browser will connect to as http://localhost:8080\n\n*localhost = The destination on the remote server, in this case itself.\n\n*80 = Port on the remote (target) machine to connect to, the port where the service is running.\n\n\nThis would allow you to access the web server on the remote server, when you have ssh access to it, but do not have web access to it.\nssh'ing to your localhost is usually pointless. It is only done to check your ssh server is running properly or keys are correct.\nThe connection refused error you see is because ssh server is not running on your local machine.  sudo apt-get install openssh-server    Then you can ssh to your local machine from localhost, or anywhere else you can get a port 22 connection to this machine from (typically behind your local network firewall)\n-D (dynamic application forwarding) is a different case, and would more apply if some tricky fat client application (eg mysql) on your local machine needs to access a server on a remote machine. It is less often used.\nThe message about privileged ports occurs when you try to redirect a local port less than 1024.  Hence the use of port 8080 in the above example, to avoid the priviledged port 80.  For the example above, your browser would use \n    http://localhost:8080\n", "Q: mount multiple hard drives to one folder as one drive I'm pretty new to this and have been searching for this a while now.. \nI need to be able to mount multiple hard drives as \"one drive\" at /mydata folder.

I am currently dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 on my work computer. Don't like having to shut down and reboot into Windows two or three times a day, but some of the software I need only runs in Windows. I want to take my existing Windows installation and just run it in a VM on Ubuntu. How would I go about doing this?\n\nA: I have done this successfully many times and do as you would like to do daily. I actually have several VMs depending on my needs (XP, Win 7, Win 2008, various Linux). One can P2V (physical to virtual) using VMWare's converter package (http://www.vmware.com/products/converter), then you can either use the free VMWare Player or VirtualBox (I mostly use VirtualBox). You can attach the machine you've created in VMWare converter to VirtualBox.\nIt helps to have a little extra RAM to do this kind of thing, and also I've found that an SSD makes a huge difference. I end up suspending my VMs (not shutting them down) and the jump to life in a few seconds.\nP.S. depending on your apps, Wine or the variants like PlayOnLinux (or CrossOver Linux) can be very usable so no VM is necessary. I have several apps that I run this way (Office 2010, FoxIT PDF Reader, Photoshop CS2, etc...)\n", "Q: Menu in Title Bar Internally, how does Unity determine which widgets in an application are part of the menu (file, edit, etc.)? Is there a attribute in GTK that determines what's part of an application's menu bar? \nAlso, do applications need to be modified in some non-standard way to work like this? I've noticed that when I download Firefox from Mozilla, there is no menu bar shown, but the Ubuntu build of Firefox has one.\n\nA: A gtk application defines what should be in the menus at the top of its window and specifies what functions should be run when each is selected. The toolkit then implements those instructions using X. That's the design of gtk (and other toolkits).\nIf you are wondering about the toolbar appearing on the top of the screen rather than at the top of the application window, the application has the same design, but a small change has been made to gtk to intercept the drawing of the application menus, and the drawing instructions are instead relayed over the session dbus to Unity which handles the drawing and signaling associated with those menus. As I recall there's an environmental variable you can set to disable this behavior.\n", "Q: How to get more CPU information than by the usual ways?

Does that tell me I've got SSE1 for single precision?\nThis is an ASUS N56V.\n\nA: Without knowing what you want to achieve, it's a bit hard to provide a good answer.\nI personally use dmidecode to get more detailed information on the hardware in a machine I'm dealing with. There's a section with all the flags supported by the processor. SSE does indeed mean SSE1.\nI'm not sure what you're missing from the information that the tools you have and /proc/cpuinfo provide. You have all the flags, so you can figure out what instructions your CPU supports.\nI'm not sure if you're developing an application that explicitly checks the processor model but isn't knowing what features your CPU supports better than knowing its name/model and having to maintain a list of supported CPUs in your solution?\nYou also have the CPU family and the exact model number in /proc/cpuinfo\n$ sudo dmidecode\n...\n    Processor Information\n            Socket Designation: U3E1\n            Type: Central Processor\n            Family: Core i7\n            Manufacturer: Intel(R) Corporation\n            ID: 51 06 04 00 FF FB EB BF\n            Signature: Type 0, Family 6, Model 69, Stepping 1\n            Flags:\n                    FPU (Floating-point unit on-chip)\n                    VME (Virtual mode extension)\n                    DE (Debugging extension)\n                    PSE (Page size extension)\n                    TSC (Time stamp counter)\n                    MSR (Model specific registers)\n                    PAE (Physical address extension)\n                    MCE (Machine check exception)\n                    CX8 (CMPXCHG8 instruction supported)\n                    APIC (On-chip APIC hardware supported)\n                    SEP (Fast system call)\n                    MTRR (Memory type range registers)\n                    PGE (Page global enable)\n                    MCA (Machine check architecture)\n                    CMOV (Conditional move instruction supported)\n                    PAT (Page attribute table)\n                    PSE-36 (36-bit page size extension)\n                    CLFSH (CLFLUSH instruction supported)\n                    DS (Debug store)\n                    ACPI (ACPI supported)\n                    MMX (MMX technology supported)\n                    FXSR (FXSAVE and FXSTOR instructions supported)\n                    SSE (Streaming SIMD extensions)\n                    SSE2 (Streaming SIMD extensions 2)\n                    SS (Self-snoop)\n                    HTT (Multi-threading)\n                    TM (Thermal monitor supported)\n                    PBE (Pending break enabled)\n            Version: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4600U CPU @ 2.10GHz\n            Voltage: 0.8 V\n            External Clock: 100 MHz\n            Max Speed: 2700 MHz\n            Current Speed: 2100 MHz\n            Status: Populated, Enabled\n            Upgrade: <OUT OF SPEC>\n            L1 Cache Handle: 0x0002\n            L2 Cache Handle: 0x0003\n            L3 Cache Handle: 0x0004\n            Serial Number: To Be Filled By O.E.M.\n            Asset Tag: To Be Filled By O.E.M.\n            Part Number: Not Specified\n            Core Count: 2\n            Core Enabled: 2\n            Thread Count: 4\n            Characteristics:\n                    64-bit capable\n...\n\n", "Q: Hi, I'm new to Ubuntu & can't get my DVDRW to work at all, please help I am running 14.04 64bit.\nNew to Ubuntu & learning as fast as I can.\nI had a dvdrom in the system but it wasn't working (turns out I had a bad cable)\nI switched it out with a working DVDRW from another system I wasn't using any more.\nThe tray opens and closes\nThe status led blinks green when I insert a disc (CDDA, DVD, DATA)\nI hear the drive spool up but it doesn't do any more than that.\nI can run some commands in terminal but need assistance with the required command lines.\nMuch appreciated :)\n\nA: There is a strong possibility that a wrong-state error is present. You may have cleared the drive via the hardware while the computer was doing a shutdown. This creates a wrong-state error.\nIf a disk is removed from a optical drive, while the system is shutting down, I have found that the driver can become confused, and upon restart, the system still thinks there is a disk in the drive, when in fact it is empty. You will see the drive icon in the Launcher, even though the drive is empty. System cannot read a empty drive that is thought to be occupied.\nJust right-click upon the drive icon, and eject the drive. Then close the drive and insure that the icon is flushed from the Launcher. Then Restart the system. Then install a disk and see if it reads. This has fixed many problems for me.\nThe above is a clear defect in the command routing software in the hardware layer. All other OS's check the contents of the drive at boot time and flush the active mode if nothing is in the drive, regardless of the last state record. Ubuntu has not fixed this error and it has been present forever. I always make sure the drive is empty before I shutdown the computer, to preclude this error.\nHope that helps, have fun and good luck!\n", "Q: AMD Radeon R5 Graphics Glitches In Ubuntu 14.04.1 My Laptop specs :\nAMD A8-6410\nRadeon R5 Graphics\n4 GB DDR3\n500 GB HDD\nI removed Windows 8.1 completely & installed Ubuntu 14.04.1\nBut, the graphics is just too damn slow.\nThe output of /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p shows :\nOpenGL vendor string:   VMware, Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.4, 128 bits)\nOpenGL version string:  2.1 Mesa 10.1.3\nNot software rendered:    no\nNot blacklisted:          yes\nGLX fbconfig:             yes\nGLX texture from pixmap:  yes\nGL npot or rect textures: yes\nGL vertex program:        yes\nGL fragment program:      yes\nGL vertex buffer object:  yes\nGL framebuffer object:    yes\nGL version is 1.4+:       yes\nUnity 3D supported:       no\nWhy Unity 3D is not supported ?

Assuming that you are using gcc, to set the compile time search path you need to use the compiler's -L flag\n   -Ldir\n       Add directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for -l.\n\nSo for example if you have installed the libraries into /usr/local/openmpi/lib, modify your gcc command line to\n-L /usr/local/openmpi/lib -lmpi_usempi -lmpi_mpifh -lmpi\n\n\nA: Solved: \"cannot find -lmpi*\" when compiling openmpi code\nSolutions: I try to check the other options in my compiling command line. I add an extra -static in the compile command line. By removing this, it finally works for me.\n\nA: Working Ubuntu 20.04 setup\nIn general, you have to pass pkg-config flags to the compilation command to be able to compile, e.g. either:\nsudo apt install libopenmpi-dev\ngcc $(pkg-config --cflags mpi) main.c $(pkg-config --libs mpi)\n\nsudo apt install libmpich-dev\ngcc $(pkg-config --cflags mpich) main.c $(pkg-config --libs mpich)\n\ndepending if you want openmpi or MPICH: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2427399/mpich-vs-openmpi\nIn theory both of those compile a simple test like this fine:\n#include <mpi.h>\n\nint main() {\n  MPI_Finalize();\n  return 0;\n}\n\nOn Ubuntu 20.04 however only the MPICH works because the libopenmpi-dev package has a bug and forgot to symlink:\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpi.so -> /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpi.so.40\n\nso you can just do it manually as a workaround:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpi.so.40 \\\n           /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpi.so\n\nBug report at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openmpi/+bug/1869612\nI found this by looking for libmpi.so with:\nlocate libmpi.so\ndpkg -L libopenmpi-dev\n\nBut it works if I just pass that directly to the compilation command:\ngcc $(pkg-config --cflags mpi) main.c /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpi.so.40\n\nI also now learnt about the existence of /usr/bin/mpicc package from the openmpi-bin package https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20739909/what-is-mpic-file-used-for but the libopenmpi-dev version appears broken on Ubuntu also due to the missing libmpi.so symlink.\n", "Q: No Legacy BIOS setting/Ubuntu not detecting Windows 8.1 I have recently purchased an Asus X551M laptop and have tried installing Mint in a dual boot configuration multiple times. I have successfully installed it twice, but bot times was unable to actually boot into the OS, or even put it first in the boot priority, as it didn't even show up in the list.\nI've decided to try installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS instead, as I've read it deals with UEFI better. My main barrier though, is that there is absolutely no option to switch to Legacy BIOS on my computer. I can disable boot security and fast boot, and I can turn on CSM. I need Windows for my schoolwork and gaming, so simply overwriting it isn't an option. I'm at my wits end and am about to give up on Linux. Does anyone have any experience with this problem, or any suggestions?\n*For both distros I used/am using the 64 bit image. I am using the Universal Usb Installer.\n*I've just tried to install 14.04 again. I disabled Secure Boot and put my USB (which was labeled as being UEFI) as the first boot priority. The Ubuntu installer runs fine, but does not detect Windows 8.1. Also, I have 3 partitions as it is, is it true you shouldn't have more than 4?\n\nIt is worth noting that if the USB is launched in CSM then Linux detects Windows, installs properly, but does not boot; nor does it become an option in the Boot Priority. If the USB is launched in UEFI mode, then Ubuntu does not detect Windows. Quite the conundrum.\n\nA: just disabling secure boot will work just fine\nif it doesn't detect windows just shrink your volume however you want via diskmgmt.msc and choose something else within your installation, you can repair your windows boot via boot-repair later on\n\nA: To expound on biozalp's answer, I submit this tutorial Dual boot Mint and Windows 8.1\nThis allowed me to install Mint with no problems. \n\nA: I have an Asus X551M too.  It was $200 and doesn't even have CD-ROM drive.  The key to getting Linux installed was to go into the BIOS setting called OS, and change from Windows 8.1 to Windows 7.  Why this is even a BIOS setting is beyond me, a real facepalm moment, but it works, as the Windows 7 setting allows booting from a USB stick.

It is really just for experimentation.  I ALSO want to experiment with the Ubuntu GUI I have, and I have only one machine to do this with.  \nSo my actual question then: Would the GUI bog down the server so much that it's not even worth it?  The machine has 1GB RAM and a 1.66Ghz processor.      \n\nA: The minimum requirements listed in the documentation include:\n\n\n*\n\n*700 MHz processor (about Intel Celeron or better)\n\n*512 MiB RAM (system memory)\n\n*5 GB of hard-drive space (or USB stick, memory card or external drive but see LiveCD for an alternative approach) \n\n\nYou are well clear above that. \nI have tried Ubuntu/Unity on an old laptop with 1 Gb of RAM and it is pretty usable; at start up Ubuntu takes up little over 300 Mb of RAM. But if you start loading heavy programmes that free memory goes away quickly. \nI would say that if it is just to store videos and pictures firing up an Unity session should not be a problem. If you really need a desktop environment but the server more free memory then you can try a lighter option such a LXDE.\n\nA: For what you want, a GUI is not going to sow down your server. You can use one of several protocols, I advise samba. Alternates would be http, ftp, nfs, ssh (sshfs) to name a few alternates.\nThe advice that  a Desktop has no role on a server is not due to performance. It is due to the fact that on dedicated servers, desktop interfaces do not add much. Most of running a server can all be done from the command line.\nIf you \"need\" a graphical interface for a server, use a web based option such as webmin. There are again several to choose from depending on what you need.\n", "Q: (X)Ubuntu some graphics only render on 2/3 of screen Short\nOn Xubuntu 14.04 running on a Inspiron i3531-1200BK laptop , the xfce log-in screen only renders 2/3s of the screen, but issue is not present for xfce desktop after logging in. Issue also exists with other 3d applications. How can I fix this?\nLonger\nI'm going to list everything I know about this laptop which is running XUbuntu 14.04 on Dell Inspiron i3531-1200BK.\nThe log in screen only renders 2/3s of the screen. After log in this fixes itself with a much of random-looking graphics resizing. I thought this was weird, but since it only existed on the log in screen I ignored it at first. This issue has been present since installing Xubuntu.\nAfter about 3 weeks of owning this device, and updating when it xubuntu every update, I found that even with the default install setting (I think LVM was actually also checked if that matters) I could not update the OS because of having less than 1mb of extra space. Since I did the default partitioning, with entire 500gb HDD and still greater than 400gb still free, I was surprised. I then used \ndpkg -l linux-* | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d\"-\"` | grep -e [0-9] | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\nbased on askubuntu help (I don't recall which, I just got that from the terminal past commands log) from someone else's Question. This seemed to let the updates go though, but uninstalled g++ and other things which I had to reinstall later. I don't know if this messed stuff up more, but the log in graphics issues predate it.\nAfter installing Oracle VM Virtualbox, I noticed if I use 3D graphics acceleration the same thing happens if I go from FULLSCREEN mode to SCALED mode I get the same issue. Instead of turning to normal scaled mode it takes up 2/3 the screen and cannot seem to be put back to fullscreen mode. Interestingly (and frustratingly) it also looses the ability for the mouse to work. I had thought the machine froze, but noticed I could TAB through stuff on the VM. After pressing the HOST key, and then ALT + TAB , I noticed that the VM was now treated as two programs in addition to the virtualbox config/launcher window.\nThis seems to be an issue with lots of 3d things.\nI'm not sure what you gals/guys need to know more (likely from terminal), but if you let me know, I will run them and update this.\n$ uname -a\nLinux user 3.13.0-37-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 22 21:28:38 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nglxgears seems to run but when I close it using the 'x' button on the window, it crashes\n$ glxgears\nRunning synchronized to the vertical refresh.

Recently I upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 LTS but found iBus going insane.\nIn 12.04 there is no English input method in the list because when an application is launched, iBus would be in a state of \"Input method off\"; then I could turn on the IM by hitting Ctl+Sp, and then input Chinese or something else.\nBut in 14.04, the English (US) is also one of the input methods. Besides that, I have Chinese (pinyin) and Japanese (mozc) activated. As a result, an application would be launched with Chinese as its default input method.

(and how does it prevent vm snapshots...) I am toying with uvtool to quickly create virtual machines. I once used vmbuilder, but its seems to be deprecated in favor of uvtool (or not ?).\nWhen created with uvt, my vm has two virtual disks defined:\n\n\n*\n\n*First one is called my-vm-name.qcow, and its size fits the size I asked for the disk. Its type is qcow2.\n\n*Second one is called my-vm-name-ds.qcow, and is small (few hundred mb). Its type is raw.\n\n\nWhat is this second disk ?\n[EDIT] I've found this in a IRC log:\n[15:26]  The second disk image is for the cloud-init data source\n[15:26]  It passes in cloud-init userdata and metadata.\nBut this is still unclear to me... What does it do. Can I simply remove it ? Should it be backed up with the VM ? ...\n[EDIT2] Another piece of information, that seems to confirm vmbuilder might be deprecated in favor of uvtool: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/auto-upgrade-testing/+bug/1261416\nReads: the vm-builder package may be pulled from the archive in trusty due to be un-maintained.\n[EDIT3] Yet another piece of information, explaining cloud-init: http://blog.octo.com/cloudinit-kesako/ This is in french.\n\nA: Answering my own question:\nWhat is my-vm-name-ds.qcow for ?\n\n\n*\n\n*uvtool relies on Ubuntu cloud images to quickly create virtual machines running Ubuntu\n\n*uvtool (namely uvt-kvm) allows the use of cloud-init framework to interact with the VM you are creating\n\n*cloud-init needs a way to get some data from you (scripts you want to run, etc.) : this is what my-vm-name-ds.qcow is for\n\n\nCan I remove my-vm-name-ds.qcow ?\n\n\n*\n\n*yes you can, but you have to remove cloud-init package from your VM before doing so, otherwise cloud-init will be stuck on boot\n\n*so to remove this second disk, first boot into your VM and apt-get purge cloud-init\n\n*then, you can remove the disk from the VM definition (using virt-manager or virsh for example)\n\n\nWhy would I want to remove that disk ?\n\n\n*\n\n*the compelling reason to remove clout-init and its disk is that it is using the raw format: this will prevent you to use the snapshot feature of virt-manager!\n\n*after removing the -ds.qcow disk (which in fact is in raw format), you'll be able to access vm shapshots feature\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to know If I have Wifi driver installed I am following this guide to just test hacking Wifi, I have read in the manual of airmon-ng that entering the command airmon-ng will return interface status, under the chipset field it said \"unknown\". So I wanted to know if I have a Wifi driver installed or not, knowing that I have a perfectly fine Wifi connection.\n\nA: You said you have a perfectly working Wifi connection, which means you have WiFi driver installed. Because, without a driver, you couldn't have a working connection.\nAs for the airmon-ng command, if the field under Chipset column is unknown, it means the program has no knowledge about the model/vendor of this chipset.

In this sense Virtualbox is no less \"ubuntish\" than Firefox. This cannot be contradicted by Virtualbox being intended at running other OSes, including Windows, inside a virtual environment.\n\nA: The solution that works is THIS.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the machine. \n\n*On the settings tab, go to storage and then under SATA Controller you’ll see your virtual hard drive (win7.vdi in the image above). \n\n*Right click on that and  'Remove attachment'. \n\n*Right click on 'Controller: IDE' and “Add Hard disk”, then locate you virtual hard drive you created earlier (as above win7.vdi).\nIt should look like so:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the machine.

I am looking to mount my mdadm RAID 1 at boot. \nThe drive location is /dev/md127 and I would like it to mount to /media/server at boot. It is formatted to ext4. Your help will be truly appreciated. \n\nA: You could add an entry to /etc/fstab:\n/dev/md127    /media/server    ext4 defaults 0 0 \n\nMake sure that /media/server is present:\nsudo mkdir -p /media/server\n\nYou could use the UUID of the partition instead of /dev/md127. The UUID of a filesystem is unlikely to change unless you alter it, whereas the partition may change its identifier and be named md0 or md255 or something like that. \nUse the blkid or lbslk command to get the UUID, and then replace /dev/md127 with UUID=xxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxx in the above line:\n# lsblk -o NAME,UUID\nNAME    UUID\nsdc     \n└─sdc1  8ebc357c-3d93-fd86-0535-cb852bbc7289\n  └─md2 5348f582-8a9c-43c3-bf5b-eaabd644035b\nsdd     \n└─sdd1  8ebc357c-3d93-fd86-0535-cb852bbc7289\n  └─md2 5348f582-8a9c-43c3-bf5b-eaabd644035b\n# blkid\n/dev/sdc1: UUID=\"8ebc357c-3d93-fd86-0535-cb852bbc7289\" UUID_SUB=\"77e19cfe-ed79-613f-bb18-b56bc30e0858\" LABEL=\"titan:2\" TYPE=\"linux_raid_member\" \n/dev/sdd1: UUID=\"8ebc357c-3d93-fd86-0535-cb852bbc7289\" UUID_SUB=\"e99d0a33-4944-4f1e-4a90-b65fa2e57b56\" LABEL=\"titan:2\" TYPE=\"linux_raid_member\" \n/dev/md2: UUID=\"5348f582-8a9c-43c3-bf5b-eaabd644035b\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n\nThe UUID of /dev/md2 (the RAID array in this case) is 5348f582-8a9c-43c3-bf5b-eaabd644035b, so the entry would look like:\nUUID=5348f582-8a9c-43c3-bf5b-eaabd644035b   /media/server   ext4    defaults  0 0\n\n", "Q: IP/DomainName of juju master or slaves changes The juju master domain name changed from juju.this.domain.example to juju.new.domain.example because of new rules from IT managers.

This does support user rights - which are respected in Linux. Since the user id of your Ubuntu user and of your MacOS user is most likely different, you are not allowed to access the files.\nSo as already mentioned, the way to go would be to access the files with super user rights - using sudo, for example.\n\nA: Rinzwind and liquidat, thanks for your help and suggestions.\nNothing seemed to work, using sudo, etc. Took a total of nine days to find answer. Knew I was working with Ubuntu 14.04 and a MacBook Pro dd image.  Knew I could mount image and access non-standard file system files but not standard file system folders. \nThis is how you can do it:\nOpen Ubuntu Software Center, search for and install the package “gnome-system-tools” (without quotes).  Or (best and preferred method) open a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-t) and enter \nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\nAfter installation, you can run users-admin from the terminal to open Users and Groups or access them via Administration > Users and Groups.\nUse the + sign and create a new user.  The New User you create needs to match the settings on the Mac, Mac image, or Mac formatted hard drive are trying to access.  For example, if your user name is Frank and your password is MyPassword on the Mac, then you need to use these settings when creating your New User.\nClick on your new user and change your account type to Administrator.\nClick on Advanced Settings > User Privileges.  Check all boxes that apply.  Click on Advanced.  Change the User ID from 1000 (or whatever it is) to 501 (which is where Macs start their user id's, if your Mac user id is different change accordingly).\nNote, you may have had to unlock your user group in order to make any changes, depending on which way you accessed it.  Unlock is located in the top right.  Click and enter password to unlock or lock.  You will see what I am talking about if needed.\nClose out of everything and restart.  You should see your Original User and the New User you just created.  If not you will have to go back into Original User and change the UID_MIN from 1000 to 501 for the New User to show in the welcome menu.  Sorry, this is what I didn't save.  You will have to google:  How to change uid in Ubuntu 14.04 (or whatever linux version you are using.  This is important.  All the instructions that worked for me were specific to Ubuntu 14.04.)\nFor the final test, I logged into my New User and mounted my Mac image.dd and TA-DAAAA!!!\nIt worked!  I was able to access all the files on my MacBook Pro dd image.\nAlso Note that I did not need read and write access.  I only wanted read access to recover files.

You should not try to install software from tar.gz since there is no standard way to do that. It is better to try to find the same software in the software center and install it automatically from there.\nHaving said that, here is what most often works more or less, given that the extracted file is called \"install.sh\":\ntar -xf somefile.tgz\nchmod +x install.sh\n./install.sh\n\n\nA: If you want to install an application that way, you should use:\nsudo tar -xfz file.tar.gz /usr/share\n\nThat will extract the program to the place, where software is normally placed, when installing through software center.\nIf you don't want to install an application and just extract something, the way is similar, but you should give a different directory path. Like:\ntar -xfz file.tar.gz /home/YOUR_USERNAME\n\n", "Q: Will an ultrawide monitor work with my Ubuntu laptop?

Gentoo doesn't recognize the RAID by BIOS because apparently Gentoo connects with each and every individual hard drive directly.\nAnyone knows if Ubuntu works the same way, when RAID is provided by integrated controller in the motherboard and by the BIOS ?\nI'm using an Gigabyte FX-990 UD5 board with 2TB caviar black HDs.\n\nA: That has nothing to do with the distro. It sounds like your board is a little funky when it comes to general Linux support.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/review/R1LPS5LC21G3ZA/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R1LPS5LC21G3ZA\n\nThis board is not directly compatible with Linux, specifically the\n  built-in Ethernet. In order for it to work you must enable IOMMU in\n  BIOS, but disable IOMMU on the linux kernel command line with\n  “iommu=soft”. Without this all will appear working, but you will have\n  absolutely no connectivity. This bug / compatibility issue affects all\n  revisions past 1.1 that have the new UEFI BIOS.\n\nSo IOMMUs are usually a nice to have for virtualized environments, it basically lets you assign pci devices to virtual hosts. Why you would need to explicitly enable it to gain access to your RAID controller is weird. iommu=soft is really bad news for performance.\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/x86/x86_64/boot-options.txt\n   General iommu options:\n     off                Don't initialize and use any kind of IOMMU.\n     noforce            Don't force hardware IOMMU usage when it is not needed.\n                        (default).\n     force              Force the use of the hardware IOMMU even when it is\n                        not actually needed (e.g. because < 3 GB memory).\n     soft               Use software bounce buffering (SWIOTLB) (default for\n                        Intel machines). This can be used to prevent the usage\n                        of an available hardware IOMMU.\n\nWhat that means is the kernel has to copy whatever it needs to read/write to an intermediate location before it can complete the DMA.

I have tried using the command line to remove it, and the bootloader. The home folder is blocked by the encryption code. \nIs there a way to recover my password, or otherwise decrypt the home folder?\n\nA: It is very unlikely that you can easily recover the encryption code and access your data. Unless you're a security expert, or have access to some brilliant minds from the NSA, you must recover your password to be able to access your data. That's in a gist the trouble with securely stored data: if you lose your key, no one can access it anymore. Not easily, anyways... \nYou may of course attempt brute-force methods to try to decrypt your device, given that you must have an idea about its characteristics (length, symbols or numbers used, etc.), and perhaps you already know it partially. Unfortunately I wouldn't have any precise recommendations to give here. Try to check out http://security.stackexchange.com for possible solutions.\n", "Q: 14.04 crashes after couple hours. Lose control of OS and CPU goes into overdrive I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a Dell Vostro 220s with Intel Pentium.\nI am trying to figure out if this problem is normal.. should I wait out the hang.\nAfter a couple hours, I will lose control of the operating system. The CPU sounds as if there is a download and install taking place, but there is no information telling me what is going on and I lose control of the system. The mouse will stagger and quickly lose the ability to click on anything and lose all functionality while the CPU is doing something on its own in overdrive. I am forced to do a hard reboot.\nIt seems as if my computer is being hijacked but can't tell for sure. At first I thought I may have gotten a bug because I clicked a link on a LinuxFromScratch pdf that is now taken over by a porn site. Since the domain used to be Linux based, I figured they had good motivation to target Linux users so I just decided to do a complete re-install since my install was less than a day old.\nThe problem still persisted. I then checked my fstab and low and behold, the swap partition was commented out. Huh? I uncommented it and figured that was the answer to my problem. After doing a reboot, the problem still persists. I checked fstab and swap is still  uncommented out so should be used when needed.\nThis is a fresh install from an ISO just recently downloaded.

This does not need you to install additional applications other than Python 3, dictd, dict-wn and python-gobject.\n\nA: You can't find in among the applications, because dictd in itself is a console application, you have to use a frontend application for it, e.g. opendict or goldendict.\nIn console, you would simple just write dict [options] word. You can look up the options at the man page of dict.\nWhat I did not cover in this answer is the installation of a dictionary to the dictd database.

Please don't hammer me too much if what I am asking is not appropriate for this forum.\nI have created a USB boot drive with Ubuntu 14.04.01 on it. I'm trying to install it on a Zoostorm Desktop machine purchase November 2013 - Zoostorm Desktop PC, AMD Elite DC A4-5300 3.4GHz, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, DVDRW, AMD HD 7480D, Windows 8.1.\nBasically I can't install Ubuntu on it or run Ubuntu from a boot USB for more than a few seconds/minutes (yesterday it was minutes, today it is seconds). Here's the problems and what I have tried so far (I'm trying not to miss anything out just in case it gives anyone an idea):\n\n\n*\n\n*IMPORTANT: The new machine had been running Windows 8 without issue\nbefore I tried to install Ubuntu. There were never any problems when\nrunning Windows 8, hardware or otherwise.\n\n*As a result of the following problems with Ubuntu installations\nyesterday the machine reboots during install have damaged the\nwindows 8 partition beyond repair/recovery. I was hoping to make the\nmachine dual boot.\n\n*Although not an Ubuntu expert, I have set up lots of Ubuntu\ninstallations in the past (from about Ubuntu 6 - it was so long ago\nI'm not quite sure what the number was), mostly dual boots with\nwindows but some just Ubuntu. I have set up and installed Ubuntu\ndesktop machines, laptops and servers. I am used to having to work\nhard to get things like wireless drivers etc. working on laptops so\nI am familiar with difficult installations and setups.\n\n*I have spent over 14 hours so far trying to get Ubuntu to install on\nthis machine.\n\n*I have tried the following using 2 different USB drives\n\n*I have recreated the USB image on the USB drives several times.\n\n*I have run \"Check disk for defects\".\n\n*Yesterday I couldn't run Ubuntu from the USB (\"Try Ubuntu without\ninstallation\") for more than than a few minutes before the machine\nreboots itself.\n\n*Today I only get to see the \"Try Ubuntu\" desktop for a few seconds\n before the machine reboots. When the machine reboots today I\n briefly get to see the number \"92\" in the bottom right hand corner\n for a few seconds then another number (too quick to see) then D7\n (on a black screen, white text nothing else on the screen). I have\n no idea what this means or why I am seeing it. Following this auto\n reboot I find that when it gets to the Ubuntu boot menu again that\n the mouse and keyboard have stopped working (both are USB). I have\n to power the machine down and restart before they will work again.\n\n*Yesterday I was able to boot to the \"Try Ubuntu\" desktop and start\n installation from there. However, after progressing down the Ubuntu\n install options the machine would eventually auto reboot at\n different places each time, sometimes when I was selecting install\n options, sometimes after Ubuntu had started installing/formatting.\n\n*If I choose to install Ubuntu now from the boot menu I see the\n ubuntu logo briefly then the screen goes black and after several\n seconds the machine reboots itself\n\n*I have tried with the Windows 8 part of the BIOS turned on and I\n have tried with all the Windows 8 boot features turned off (this\n includes turning off Fast Boot).\n\n*I have tried 3 different hard drives.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas, suggestions of what else I could try or what other information may help? \nThanks.\n\nA: I finally got Ubuntu to install on the Zoostorm by adding nomodeset to the Live USB boot menu options as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the startup boot screen press e\n\n*Find the line ending quiet splash and add nodemodeset just\nbefore it.\n\n*Press F10 to boot (for me I have try before install selected before I pressed e)\n\n*Choose install Ubuntu from the desktop. (This will probably also\nwork if you choose install Ubuntu from the startup menu, but I\nhaven't tried it).\n\n*Wait for this install then choose \"restart now\". (NOTE: During the\ninstall my screen went black but pressing \"any key\" refreshed the\nscreen - looks like a screen saver blank screen or something).\n\n*The machine then restarted and I saw the Ubuntu loading logo.\nShortly after this the machine rebooted again. Restart the machine\nby turning it on and off again and hold down shift to\nensure that you see the grub boot menu.\n\n*At the Ubuntu boot menu press e again and repeat steps 2. and 3.\n\n*You should then boot in to your Ubuntu install.\n\n*You will now need to permanently modify your kernel boot parameters\n(unless you are going to try and find the right video driver). To do\nthis I installed Grub Customizer following these instructions. From Grub Customizer choose the\n\"General settings\" tab and enter \"nomodeset\" in the kernel\nparameters before \"quiet splash\". Then hit the \"Save\" button.\n\n*Next reboot and check that you log in to Ubuntu without the machine\n rebooting itself.\nI got the above idea when looking at Ubuntu forums this post. According to this article:\n\nAdding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video\n  drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\n\n", "Q: Compile a LaTeX file from Vim and not from terminal I am compiling my LaTeX files from terminal and it gets a little annoying to go every time in terminal and use:\nxelatex \"file-path\"\n\nIs there a way to do this from inside Vim?\n\nA: Try something like:\ncommand C !xelatex %\n\nin your ~/.vimrc.\nThen you can do:\n:C\n\nin vim to compile the file.\nYou can do more complex operations using functions:\nfunction WriteCompileTex()\n  write\n  :! xelatex %\nendfunction\ncommand WC :call WriteCompileTex()\n\nNote that user-defined commands and functions must begin with a capital letter. \nYou can also do:\nau BufWritePost *.tex ! xelatex %\n\nThis will run this command whenever a .tex file is written to, so that you can simply do :w, and your Tex file will be compiled after saving.\n\nA: If you are serious about the couple vim + latex, my preferred option is to use the couple latexxmk + LaTeXBox. \nlatexmk is independent of the editor, really --- it's a script that watches the files needed to compile a latex document and re-run the compilation when needed. Configuration is a bit complex, but it is a really useful tool. For example, my setup for xelatex is having a latexmkrc file (in the same directory) like this: \n$pdf_previewer = \"start evince\";\n$pdf_pdf_update_method = 0;\n$dvi_mode = 0;\n$pdf_mode = 1;\n$preview_continuous_mode = 1;\n$pdflatex = \"xelatex %O %S\";\n\nnow you can run latexmk file-name (from the same directory!) and you will have automatic, background compilation every time you modify the file (or any dependent file --- like a drawing or a bibliography). Just save the file and watch the preview automatically update. \nlatexmk is in the universe repository, so if you have that enabled you can simply install it by sudo apt-get install latexmk. \nLaTeX-BoX is a plugin for vim that simplify the editing of the LaTeX files, and uses latexmk to compile. Install it following the instruction on the linked page, and add this to your .vimrc: \n\" add a <comment> vim: set spelllang=es: to change language\n\" LaTeX:\nlet g:tex_flavor='latex'\nautocmd FileType tex set spell wrap linebreak\nlet g:LatexBox_latexmk_async=1\nlet g:LatexBox_latexmk_preview_continuously=1\nlet g:LatexBox_quickfix=2\nlet g:LaTeXBox_output_type='' \"Let latexmkrc choose the type \n\n(change to your taste). Now you start the background compilation from vim with the command \\ll. \n", "Q: In 14.04 how do I run a bash script I wrote without opening a terminal? I use terminal a lot.  I wrote a script and have it in ~/blah/script.sh now.  How can I run the script from Unity (Dash?)?\nA long time ago I would have used ALT-F2 and typed my command, but that doesn't do what I expect now.  \nMaybe modifying some $PATH var somewhere so dash can find it...?  I don't want to change the dir the script is in because it's in a place where I serve various scripts for reasons.\nTips?\n\nA: Simply create a .desktop file and save it in ~/.local/share/applications. In its most basic form:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=name_of_your_script_like_you_see_it_in_Dash\nExec=sh /path/to/script.sh\nIcon=/path/to/some/icon\nType=Application\n\nCopy it into an empty file, save it as script.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications.\nAfter log out /in, it will appear in Dash.\nIf the script is executable, you can replace Exec=sh /path/to/script.sh by simply: Exec=/path/to/script.sh, or if you don't have the language extension on the script: Exec=/path/to/script\nNote\nIf the path to your script contains (folder-) names with spaces, you can simply escape it by putting the name between quotes. For example:\nExec=sh /path/with/'Folder with spaces'/to/script.sh\n\n(spaces in the path to your icon can/should be left as they are)\n", "Q: How do I sync my system clock via the internet?

On ubuntu and few other distros I've tried, when the user is prompted with a yes or no question, 99% of the time it prompts the user to input y or n depending on the choice. But the only exception to this --that I have seen so far-- is when adding a ppa using the add-apt-repository command. It asks you to hit ENTER to continue, or ctrl-c to cancel. Is there a specific reason behind this or is it just the way it was designed?\n\nA: You can read script by command : cat /usr/bin/add-apt-repository. In which following lines are related to this:\n# display more information about the shortcut / ppa info\n    if not options.assume_yes and shortcut.should_confirm():\n        try:\n            info = shortcut.info()\n        except ShortcutException as e:\n            print(e)\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n        print(\" %s\" % (info[\"description\"] or \"\"))\n        print(_(\" More info: %s\") % str(info[\"web_link\"]))\n        if (sys.stdin.isatty() and\n            not \"FORCE_ADD_APT_REPOSITORY\" in os.environ):\n            if options.remove:\n                print(_(\"Press [ENTER] to continue or ctrl-c to cancel removing it\"))\n            else:\n                print(_(\"Press [ENTER] to continue or ctrl-c to cancel adding it\"))\n            sys.stdin.readline()\n\nHence it asks Press [ENTER] to continue or ctrl-c to cancel adding it which is designed and if you want to get rid of this then use : -y or --yes to Assume yes to all queries.\n", "Q: Inkscape poor performance and lags on powerfull machine I have problem with Inkscape.

Asking to start at the run levels could mean at the beginning of those run levels, before anything else has started.  Like before things like any part of the file system have been mounted, and certainly before minimal networking is available.  \nstart on started tty1 will wait till the first terminal is started before starting the program, which is basically the same time that you would be able to run/test things manually.  So your program starts up later in the boot process, but you should get more consistent results.\n\nA: Maybe adding env DISPLAY=:0 to the Upstart job would help?

I'm doing some remastering of Lubuntu 14.04 LiveCD, and need to run the following command at startup:\n/sbin/ifconfig eth0 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.0.0\n\nFirst, I tried modifying rc.local as follows:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n\n/sbin/ifconfig eth0 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.0.0\n\nexit 0\n\nExecution bit was set via:\nchmod +x /etc/rc.local\n\nThat didn't work, so I tried writing this bash script (which I set to executable) and placing it in /usr/bin/\n#!/bin/bash\n/sbin/ifconfig eth0 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.0.0\n\nIn conjunction with the above action, I modified rc.local thus:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n\n/usr/bin/myscript\n\nexit 0\n\nDidn't work. Keeping the bash script in /usr/bin/, I edited /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart with this line:\n@/usr/bin/myscript\n\nThis, too, failed to produce the desired result. Have I made a mistake with something I've tried, or is there something else I should be doing?\nEDIT:\nI've been unable to figure out how to utilize the casper parameters mentioned in Elder Greek's answer. Any further help on that front would be greatly appreciated. \nThe comments in the link he/she posted turned out to be helpful, though. One commenter pointed out that the bash script located at /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/23networking can be edited to assign a static ip to eth0. \nThe commenter also mentions editing the /etc/network/interfaces file, which is what I did. It works, but at a price: a lengthy delay at bootup while waiting on the network to configure. Here are the relevant bits: \n/etc/network/interfaces\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 10.xxx.xxx.xxx\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 10.xxx.xxx.xxx\n\n~/isolinux/isolinux.cfg\ndefault live\nlabel live\n    say Booting an Ubuntu Live session...\n    kernel /casper/vmlinuz\n    append file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash ip=frommedia --\n\nIn my experience, what normally happens is that, regardless of what changes you make to the network/interfaces file, when the LiveCD boots, it's forced to a default state by the 23networking bash script I mentioned prior. The ip=frommedia edit at the end of isolinux.cfg forces the script to use whatever is present in the network/interfaces file.\nAs the commenter mentioned, the 23networking script can be edited to set a static ip. If anyone can help me with that (not so good with bash scripting), that would be great.\n\nA: If I attempt to run /sbin/ifconfig eth0 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.0.0 manually I get\nSIOCSIFADDR: Operation not permitted\nSIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not permitted\nSIOCSIFNETMASK: Operation not permitted\nFollowing the logic of that, I attempted\nsudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.0.0\nWhich completed without error.

Some of them need root access, so I use them with sudo. However, sometimes I get confused, e.g. for the mySQL backup, which also needs a mySQL root password.\nI have now implemented a workaround in a bash script like this\necho \"Please enter root password\"\nsudo echo \"Ok\"\nsudo mysqldump --all-databases --opt -u root -p  > ~/backup.dump\n\nThe idea behind this is: the sudo password will be cached. If it is entered in the beginning, it will not be prompted during the mySQL backup, so it cannot be confused with the mySQL root password any more.\nIs this approach safe to use or is there anything wrong with it?\n\nA: Yes,\nthat approach is as save as any normal use of sudo.\nWhen you use sudo, the password is cached, in the default configuration.\nAnd you use a dummy command to put the password into that standard cache, by a command doing nothing, as root - which is certainly not dangerous.\nsudoonly\nBecause your example uses mysqldump, which also uses a password, I'd like to make clear that the above is unrelated to the mysql password, it's only relevant to the sudo on the example line sudo mysqldump ....\nEspecially, does not solve the problem of giving a password to mysqldump etc in a script, without having it show up on the command line in ps, top or any process manager GUI to all users on the system.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSet timeout\nThe timeout of the sudo password cache is 15 minutes by default, and can be changed by setting timestamp_timeout in sudoers. Using sudo visudo, add a line like\nDefaults    timestamp_timeout=30\n\nto /etc/sudoers. (Set timestamp_timeout to 0 to disable the cache.)\n", "Q: How do I get my QML program to utilize Unity7 notifications? Is there an API I can use? I am developing a screenshot application in QML, and I wish to utilize Unity 7 notifications, similar to what Rhythmbox uses when notifying a user that a new song has started, or when the volume is changed.\nDoes an API exist for this? A small coding example would be helpful.\n\nA: As far as I know, no such API exists to call libnotify from a QML component.\nTo avoid creating a C++ plugin just to get notifications for a desktop application, I would use pyotherside to call a small python module to do the job:\n\nPrerequisite:\nInstall pyotherside: sudo ap-get install pyotherside\n\nFirst the QML:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\nimport io.thp.pyotherside 1.2\n\nRectangle {\n    width: 200\n    height: 200\n\n    Button {\n        text: \"press\"\n        anchors.centerIn: parent\n        onClicked: {\n            py.call('notify.pressme', [], function() {});\n        }\n    }\n\n    Python {\n        id: py\n        Component.onCompleted: {\n            addImportPath(Qt.resolvedUrl('.'));\n            importModule('notify', function() {});\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nAnd the python code (keep both in the same directory), a file named notify.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\n\ndef pressme():\n    subprocess.call([\"notify-send\", \"hello\", \"world\"])\n\nAfter pressing the QML Button, you'll get a notification like this one:\n\nPlease read the notify-send man page for further options.\n", "Q: Installed Pygame, but Python claims it does not exist I want to use pygame, but I am having trouble installing/using it.

What measures should i take to avoid unpleasent situations like messing my files .\nI want to install ubuntu as my only and primary os . Really beginner here,  hope i have a reasonable idea of what i am talking about..\n\nA: it may be a good idea to backup files from the win partition on a different drive before you start - if you are looking to shrink drives down before installing over windows partition as mike said a tip would be to use the micro$oft windows native drive shrinker as to avoid errors between *ix and win formatting.   Using the distro you want in live you should be able to identify what partition win core os is installed on (sda,sdb.. etc...) and when installing use that drive.\n\nA: If you choose the correct drive on setup, everything will be fine. \nUbuntu is able to read all common file systems, so you will be able to access your other hard drives natively with Ubuntu. \nIf you want to remove Windows entirely, just format the whole hard drive (The one with the right size) to ext4 or btrfs during setup. Leave some place for a swap partition if desired (at least the size of your RAM to enable hibernation etc.) and mark that partition/empty space as swap. Ubuntu will do the rest for you (unless you used the nice and easy automatic partition setup, in which case Ubuntu will do ALL partitioning for you).\n\nA: The question is somewhat hard to read, but if I get it right, your main point is to make it really, really save to not damage the data on the other disks?\nThere is no reason the Ubuntu setup should cause harm to the data on the other disks, of course; \nBut you say partitioning under Linux is completely new to you,\nand you will handle all your important data at once.\nThen, it may still be a good idea to take some extra care - distraction and confusion does happen, and the difference between the right and the wrong disk is not much - like /dev/sda or /dev/sdb. \nYou could disconnect the extra harddrives.\nThey would not be accessible during the critical stuff like partitioning, it's just save.\nYou would not set up mountpoints for them in that stage - but after reconnecting the disks, you can use the disk setup tools again, but take care to not use any dangerous operations - if you do not define a partition to format, you can not hit the wrong disk with formating.\n\nReminds me of an old insight from the network world:\nThere's only one way to make it \"really, really\" save:\nUse an air gap.  \n(There seem to be a few side-questions in the text - please post them as separate, concise questions.)\n", "Q: iMac doesn't boot from same usb that works on MacBook Air I have created a bootable USB with Ubuntu that works fine on my MacBook Air (year 2011) but is not detected by my iMac (2004) when I press Alt. rEFIx does not help either. \nI have tried with other distros (although it is also based on Ubuntu) and get the same result. \nIsn't this strange? \nThanks.\nEsteban \n\nA: Your iMac probably has a PowerPC processor -- making it's incompatible with the x86/64 build that you'd be using on your Mac Book Air (I assume that's what MBA means).

I've been trying to remove this \"package\" (XRCed), which I have no idea how I got installed in the first place.\nIt seems it has something to do with this: http://manned.org/xrced/cbeff1fd\nThe thing is I cannot find it in the Ubuntu Software Center, and going sudo apt-get remove XRCed does nothing.

I have gone through multiple driver purges and reinstalls to no avail.

This ensures the setting application matches our driver version.\nThen we may change the screen resolution from the XServer Display Configuration tab:\n\nNote that on installing from xorg-edgers ppa we should take care to only install the nvidia drivers but not other X components also maintained by this ppa because these may introduce instabilities to our system. In case we had accidentaly run an upgrade on all packages we need to run ppa-purge to restore to default packages. \nThen we may again add the ppa, install the nvidia driver only to then deactivate the ppa again. This makes sure we do not install possibly unstable other X components.\n\nA: Assistance much appreciated. I followed your guidance, reinstalling the driver, and still had the same issue.\nI decided to do a fresh install with 14.10 today and the problem looks to be resolved. The card is recognized properly and I'm able to adjust to 1920x1080 resolution through the advanced settings in nvidia settings.

When Ubuntu One died a tragic death, for many users including myself the very awesome Copy app took its place. While Copy has many advantages, one disadvantage is that anything you want to sync needs to be in one single folder called Copy in your Home folder. Ubuntu One was able to sync entire folders within ~, but Copy can only sync ~/Copy.\nOn my computer that is connected to my Copy account, I circumvented this by placing symbolic links inside ~/Copy that point to the folders in my Home folder that I want backed up.\nIs it possible to add another computer to the mix, and have Copy back up and transfer all my files from the same folders in ~ between both computers? That way, I have Computer 1 backed up to the cloud, and Computer 2 backed up to the cloud; and whenever there is a change on Computer 1 or Computer 2, the change is made on the cloud and on the other computer.\n\nA: Yes, as that is what I do.\nI'll assume that on your first computer, your files are in ~/Documents, ~/Pictures etc and you've created symbolic links to ~/Copy/Documents, ~/Copy/Pictures.\nOn your second computer, synchronise your Copy folder with the cloud (or copy it across using network/USB etc), and then create the symbolic links from ~/Copy/Documents etc to ~/Documents\nJob done :)\n", "Q: How to install desktop environments such as kubuntu and gnome safely Help!

It significantly slowed down my laptop. I wanted to check what is inside rubbish bin so I opened it, but it was taking a long time to open. I had hundreds files in that bin, so it could take some time. I clicked the bin icon again, which probably caused another window to load. After an hour it still didn't open any rubbish bin window and my computer was frozen. I decided to restart the computer, so I held the power button to turn it off and then turn it on again. \nSince then, from the moment it goes through boot process it ends at black screen. It doesn't load the desktop. I left the laptop overnight to see if it will respond after that long time, but it didn't. I tried restarting it couple of times, without result. \nWhat are my options in this situation? I cannot reinstall the system since I have a disk full of data that I need to keep. \nUPDATE:\nI was doing recovery files using photorec and I selected wrong partitions.

I've read that changing this to BIOS would cause trouble with Windows, so it is not an option. \nFirst I tried to create a Ubuntu 14.04 LiveUSB with persistence enabled. However I couldn't manage to boot it (it never showed up in the list of bootable devices). A live version of the same distribution however was bootable. \nThe problem with the LiveUSB version is, that I can't do any permanent changes to the installed packages, which I need to customize. There are a view guides out there telling how to create a custom Linux distribution using Linux tools. However I couldn't find anything on how to do it on a Windows machine. \nSo how do I setup a custom Ubuntu 14.04 Live-USB on Windows 8.1? Any advice is highly appreciated.\n\nA: If you want to support EFI boot mode, you should use Rufus.\nFirst off, download Rufus. Plug in the the Ubuntu ISO and let it churn. Make sure you have it set to GPT partiton scheme for UEFI computers. \nWhen that is done, open up your favorite partition editor that is not on the USB drive. Shrink the partition containing Ubuntu to 1GB. That should be enough. In the remaining unallocated space, create an EXT4 partion named casper-rw. The naming must be exact.\nWhen you reboot, your PC should detect the drive and allow you to use a persistent Ubuntu USB drive on almost any computer in the world. \nNote that you must boot with the persistent flag the first time. To do this, simply choose the boot menu edit option (F6) when starting up. Add persistent to the end of  the line. Once you are in, mount your USB drive and look for syslinux.cfg. Replace the contents of that file with this:\ndefault persistent\nlabel persistent\n  say Booting an Ubuntu Persistent session...\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper persistent initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash noprompt --\n\nSourced from this answer, this script will make your system boot persistent all the time and remove the \"Try/Install\" so it boots faster. You can still install Ubuntu to guest sessions using Ubiquity, though.\n\nA: Warning! This does not give a direct answer to your question but it gives a work-around with some bonus content. Hope it helps.\nYou can always install Ubuntu in VirtualBox, do your thing there and as a bonus also test your modified Ubuntu in a virtual environment before you even try it out on your real hardware. Booting from a virtual USB is not an issue but as far as I remember you need the Oracle version for the USB support, which is not available in the open source one. When I'm doing stuff like this I always check and double check in VBox. That's why every custom Ubuntu I've managed to create never failed to boot or give me serious headaches on my machine.\nTake a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization#Testing_the_CD (VBox is mentioned before the Troubleshooting sub-section). Make sure you also read the full article. It's worth it.\nOf course testing in VBox does NOT guarantee you a 100% successful deployment especially when it comes to hardware (e.g. you add/remove some driver) but it is definitely the preferable way to do customizations and improve their quality.\nEDIT\nFor information on EFI booting see @Whaaaaaat's reply.

It's based on keyboard shortcuts like i for entering text and dd for deleting textlines, dw for deleting words, d2w for deleting two words.\nIn your case: to paste your text from the clipboard use \"*p\nAnd to replace text use :s/foo/bar/g replacing foo with bar here.\n\nA: ...why not use a script? Check xclip (sudo apt-get install xclip)\n xclip -o -selection clipboard  \n\nwill send the clipboard to standard output, and with -i you can replace the clipboard. \nSo \n xclip -o -selection clipboard | sed \"s/change this/to this/\" | xclip -i -selection clipboard \n\nwill apply the change to the selection, and now you can paste it. \nIf you want a graphical thing, you can embed the script with yad:\n#! /bin/bash \n#\nyad --title Choose --button One:1 --button Two:2 --button Three:3\nchoice=$?\ncase $choice in\n        1) \n        xclip -o -selection clipboard | \n                sed \"s/one/uno/\" | \n                xclip -i -selection clipboard\n        xclip -o selection clipboard\n        ;;\n        2)      \n        xclip -o -selection clipboard | \n                sed \"s/two/dos/\" | \n                xclip -i -selection clipboard\n        xclip -o selection clipboard\n        ;;\n        3)\n        echo \"executing 3 --- well, you got the idea\"\n        ;;\nesac\n\nThat will show you a dialog like this: \n\nNotice that the script will both modify the clipboard (paste) buffer and print it. \nTo embed this in an editor, for example vim, you can do the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Add to your .vimrc: \nnmap <F4> :r ! /path/to/the/script <CR>\n\n\n*run for example gvim.\n\n*Now you copy the text, go the the editor, press F4. Choose the change you want to apply. \n\n*The text will appear in the editor. If it's ok as is, you can paste it. Otherwise \n\n*Edit the text and copy it again. (In gvim, you can select the text with the mouse and simply choose paste --- or learn the vim commands, whatever). \nIt could be optimized for sure (you probably can easily define another key to select and paste the modified text so that you have even less keypress to use)\n", "Q: Cannot access the eCampus website of my university I'm trying to access my university's ecampus website(using Mozilla Firefox) and I cannot access it(the page remains blank).\nThe link is the following: http://ecampus.ucn.dk\n--I can access the page from windows and I'm using tethering to have Internet on Linux and I can access the website from my phone--\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: Found the answer here: http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/06/13/firefox-30-blocks-access-on-non-windows-platforms-to-sharepoint-and-iis-sites/\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Firefox\n\n*In the address bar, enter the following: about:config\n\n*If prompted, click on the I’ll be careful, I promise! button.\n\n*Search for the following:\nnetwork.negotiate-auth.allow-insecure-ntlm-v1\n\n\n*Once the network.negotiate-auth.allow-insecure-ntlm-v1 setting is located, double-click on the setting.

Here's the content of /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that\n    # the server uses to identify itself.

I'm going to install Linux on Lenovo B5400, which contains:\n\n\n*\n\n*500GB Hybrid SSHD with a 8 GB SSD and 500 GB HDD\n\n\nDesigning partitions for my 2 Linux distros was quite easy before, when I had only HDD. I always had:\n\n\n*\n\n*10GB for Linux distro (mounted as \"/\")\n\n*10GB for another distro (again \"/\"; for another distro; for testing purposes or to assure continuity when switching distros)\n\n*2GB for swap (used for both distros; no need to separate)\n\n*300GB+ for \"/home\" (used for both distros; different usernames eliminates possible\nconflicts)\n\n\nIt's simple, isn't it? I would like to keep this approach, but I know that SSD has its own specificity - it prefers to be read, continuous writing may affect its life span. I don't want to kill SSD in a year, so I would like to move some system partitions to HDD in order to protect SSD. As far as I know /tmp is one of often read&written locations. How much space it needs? What else should be placed on HDD?\nOr: how to design partitions to achieve exactly the same effect and to keep SSD as safe as possible?\nI'd be grateful for your help.\n\nA: In a hybrid SSHD all SSD access is integrated with the hard drive's firmware and should not be controlled by the OS. You will be safe to just use, partition and format your 500 GB hard drive and rely on the engineers of that drive to give you optimum performance from the integrated SSD cache.\nAlso see Is Seagate's new \"FAST Factor Boot\" technology compatible with Ubuntu? for a bit more background considerations.\n\nA: If you're concerned about excessive read/write with the /tmp directory, you can make it so that /tmp is a filesystem stored exclusively in RAM as per this comment: How is the /tmp directory cleaned up?\nI've never heard of permanent writing having adverse effects on an SSD - it's excessive writing that really has the effects.\nIn your case I think your best bet would be to put your main / onto the 8 GB SSD (as opposed to the 10GB you normally use) and put the rest of your partitions on your HDD, as you typically did. \n", "Q: How to make macros that play sound, activated by a keyboard key? This one may be a little too specific, and it's probably not easily possible, but I'm going to ask it anyway. An old Dutch proverb makes me ask, \"If you never shoot, you always miss.\"\nThe title is pretty much explaining the question, but in case I need to get more specific on the subject; I want to make a macro, that is activated by a key on the keyboard(such as F2). I want it to do one thing, play a sound. This is purely meant to be a novelty addon, because it has pretty much no use, and it plays the sound of Hitler shouting \"NEIN NEIN NEIN\". So yeah, pretty novelty.\nI don't really quite care about the format needed to use(I could convert to about any format), if that's anything important. I also want to be able to assign multiple macros(each to its own key of course).\nIs this possible, and if yes, how do I do it?\n\nA: (I always used to wonder why you could answer your own question. I guess I just found out.)\nI recently discovered a method to do this on Compiz desktops. If you are using Unity, you can use Sneetsher's answer. However I am using a Compiz based desktop so that doesn't apply to me, but it can be done.\nFirst, download the audio file you want to have it play. This needs to be in OGG format, AFAIK, so if it's in another format such as mp3 then you need to convert it. A good website is here. That website also supports many other media formats, including images and videos, so if you need to convert files frequently you may want to bookmark it.\nNext, open up the CompizConfig settings manager, by searching for it in the dash. Then click commands. Make sure that this plugin is enabled by clicking the checkbox to the left, if it isn't already. Then, in an empty text field, type in:\npaplay <full path to file and it's filename>\n\nSo if your file is in /home/john/macros/file.ogg:\npaplay /home/john/macros/file.ogg\n\nThen take note of the label next to the text field you entered the command into(such as \"Command line 0\") and click \"Key bindings\". (There is also \"Edge bindings\" and \"Button bindings\" but it is rather impractical). Click the \"disabled\" button next to the binding that corresponds to the field you used, so if you entered the command in Command line 0 then click the button next to \"Run command 0\". In the box that appears check \"enabled\", and press \"Grab key combination\". Press any unused key that you want to trigger the sound. You can also hold shift, control, alt, or the super key.\nClick OK, then click back, and exit the settings manager. Your new hotkey now works!\n\nA: You can use aplay from alsa-utils package.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go Unity Control Center → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Custom\n\n*Add (+) new one, name it, put command:\naplay /full-path-to/audio-file.wav\n\n\n*Set key combination you want, ex: F2\n", "Q: Ubuntu Intel wireless 3160 AC not working/slow/disconnecting/unstable I had just bought a toshiba l50-b-1q0 with intel wireless 3160AC module.\nI have installed ubuntu 12.04 (I heard 14 natty is even worse) and tried different kernels: 3.12rc4, 3.11, 3.13.2, 3.17.

If you have any idea about how to improve the connection please tell me.\nI hope someone will find this post useful. \n\nA: I had a problem similar to this. I downloaded the firmware from here: http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi\nAnd copied the .ucode file into /lib/firmware. After rebooting everything worked fine. I have linux-firmware and linux-firmaware-nonfree packages installed, but I think those may have older versions of the firmware.\nAnyway, I hope this helps someone with a similar problem.\n\nA: Try turning off bluetooth (with rfkill, for example).\nI had a similar problem after upgrading from 14.10 to 15.04. I have a carbon X1, but it also uses iwlwifi. I fixed the problem by turning off bluetooth with rfkill. The page for the iwlwifi driver suggests that running wifi & bluetooth at the same time is difficult. I note that the script reports that your bluetooth is at least enabled.\nThere's some sort of iwlwifi driver parameters available for trying to make the two work together better, which you might explore if you actually need bluetooth. I have no use for it, so I just turned it off and everything was fine.\nMy guess at what happened to me: right after I installed 14.10, I removed a bunch of packages I didn't need. Possibly, one of these was bluetooth. Thus the problem never came up. Then when I upgraded, some sort of ubuntu-basic-packages-we-figure-everyone-will-want metapackage depended on bluetooth, so bluetooth was reinstalled, creating the problem. This seems like it could also have been what happened to you.\n\nA: Using the \"Intel Wireless 3160ac chipset\", I was unable to associate with any AP (Access Point).\nFirst I tried the patch above (disabling 11n) - but I didn't like this solution, as I was forces to use a lower bitrate.\nAfter some extra research I found the problem -  bluetooth.\nIt is being addressed in the iwlwifi driver as the WiFi/BT co-exist problem.\n==== FIX ====\n[super easy] - disable the bt_coex_active flag:\necho options iwlwifi bt_coex_active=0 | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n\n", "Q: Autoremove command removed too many packages I was uninstalling some items from Xubuntu 14.04 and APT suggested I use autoremove, so I did, and when I logged in after rebooting everything important is gone. Even my Chrome browser is uninstalled.\nWhat should I do?\nHere is my history log\nStart-Date: 2014-10-23  17:34:08\nCommandline: apt-get purge wine*\nPurge: gconf-service:i386 (3.2.6-0ubuntu2),

I am executing the following command:\nchmod 000 x.txt\nbut as owner I still can rename it ! why ? \nand how can I prevent all people from renaming that file ?\n\nA: Directories are special files containing a list of named entries. Each entry references another file object, which in turn contains the locations of the file content on disk. When you create, move, or delete a “file” (and remember that directories are files too) you're actually creating, renaming, or deleting entries in a directory list – you're changing the directory the entry is part of. Since you need write permissions to an object to change it, you need write permissions to a directory to create, move, or delete entries within it.\nExample\nLet's assume you have a file x in directory a. To rename x a user needs write access to a. To revoke write access from anyone, who isn't the owner of a do:\nchmod go-w a\n\nThis revokes (-) the “write” permission (w) for the classes “owner group“ (g) and “other“ (o).\n\nA: As correctly answered by David Foerster, the rights to manipulate files and directories depends on the permission on the containing directory. \nSaid that, there is a (dirty?) trick to avoid that a directory could be deleted even if you have right on the containing one: put in it a (possibly hidden) file, and make that and the directory no-writable. Look at this example: \n[romano:~] mkdir tmp/test; cd tmp/test\n[romano:~/tmp/test] % mkdir subdir_e subdir_f\n[romano:~/tmp/test] % touch subdir_f/.hiddenfile\n\nI created two subdirs, one empty and the other with an hidden file. \n[romano:~/tmp/test] % chmod 555 subdir_f/.hiddenfile subdir_f subdir_e\n[romano:~/tmp/test] % sudo chown root subdir_f/.hiddenfile subdir_f subdir_e\n\nI make this directory and the hidden file no-writable, by changing permission and giving ownership to root (otherwise I can simply change permission back). Let's see the status: \n[romano:~/tmp/test] % ls -la  \ntotal 16\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 romano romano 4096 oct 23 16:37 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 romano romano 4096 oct 23 16:31 ..\ndr-xr-xr-x 2 root   romano 4096 oct 23 16:37 subdir_e\ndr-xr-xr-x 2 root   romano 4096 oct 23 16:37 subdir_f\n\nNotice that I own and have write rights to ., which is my current directory, so if I do: \n[romano:~/tmp/test] % rmdir subdir_e\n\nit succeeds, because I can modify . as I like. But if I try the same with the non-empty subdir: \n[romano:~/tmp/test] % rmdir subdir_f\nrmdir: failed to remove ‘subdir_f’: Directory not empty\n[romano:~/tmp/test] 1 % rm -rf subdir_f\nrm: cannot remove ‘subdir_f/.hiddenfile’: Permission denied\n[romano:~/tmp/test] 1 % chown romano subdir_f\nchown: changing ownership of ‘subdir_f’: Operation not permitted\n\n...I need root privilege to remove it now. \n", "Q: How to configure dual monitors with Ubuntu 14.04 and Radeon X1300/X1500 I recently upgraded my system from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04.

After trying various things (the last one was to upgrade the nvidia driver, which was probably a mistake - my previous Dell Laptop had a nvidia video card, this one has AMD radeon), I ended up not being able to boot at all.\nI booted with the previous kernel version 3.13.0-36 and all my issues were gone! For now, I simply deleted the 3.13.0-37 kernel, but I wonder if this is a good idea on the long term. Should I try to reinstall the 3.13.0-37 kernel?\nCan I find out what went wrong in the first place? I was not even online when the suspended state problem first arised, so it cannot be a recent upgrade. About the nvidia driver instead of radeon - this is clearly my mistake. Should I delete the nvidia driver? And should I install a radeon driver? How do I find out which video card is in use and how can I manage the 2 graphic cards?\nMaybe I need to ask another question about the video cards, for now I would just like to know what to do about the linux kernel.\n\nA: If a new kernel breaks your system and your system works fine with the old kernel, simply continue using the old kernel until another kernel version is released in the repositories.\nThere is either a bug in the kernel or an unfortunate compatibility issue between the new kernel and one or more of your system drivers.\nEdit after additional context:\nYes, you should try purging the package and re-installing it:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic\n\n", "Q: My mouse pointer is shredded / chopped up Yesterday my mouse cursor got into a fight with a terminal cursor and lost.

Moreover, the man page for pm-suspend says that while it is ok to call it from the command line, it's normally intended to be called through your desktop power manager.\nThe man page adds that when called from the command line, \"it is not guarenteed that all of your programs in your desktop session keep working as expected.\"\nMost of the problems seem to be from services or modules not stopped or unloaded before the suspend. For a good discussion of this issue, along with ways to work around it, see Suspend to Ram in the Arch wiki.\nThe Arch Wiki also suggests allowing a particular user to run pm-suspend without sudo through visudo to add the following line to /etc/sudoers:\nusername  ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend\n\nLXDE uses the xfce4-power-manager, which uses pkexec to call pm-suspend. pkexec allows execution of a program as another user, in this case root. \nThe authentication is handled by polkit. It would normally prompt for a password, but as I learned from pkexec with no password it is possible to suppress this through a file in /usr/share/polkit-1/actions.\nThere's a file there called org.freedesktop.upower.policy (upower is involved in calling pm-suspend but I left it out for simplicity). \nThis file contains the line <allow_active>yes</allow-active>, which is what allows the action to proceed without asking for a password.\nPower-related actions are much more complicated than locking the screen or bringing up the menu. It may be better to use the suspend option in the power manager.\nIf your suspend function-key works, you might find that convenient. If it doesn't appear to work at first, check the settings in the power manager. In Lubuntu, the sleep button is not set to suspend by default.\nYou may also enjoy working through the issues at the Arch page in order to use pm-suspend directly. But be careful. I've used the command directly on several other laptops with no problem. On this particular laptop (Lenovo S10-3) it killed the wifi driver. I had to unplug the CMOS battery to get it working again.\n\nA: Sure, \nyou can try this:\necho mem > /sys/power/state \n\nmaybe you have to be sudo to run it.\n\nA: This can be done through DBus no need for sudo or higher privileges.

I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 13.04 to 14.04, and ran Boot Repair in order to make the GRUB the default loader. However, it failed to achieve what I wanted, reporting an error (http://paste.ubuntu.com/8640254/). When at startup I press F9 and check the boot menu, it shows two copies of Ubuntu loaders. Any idea as to how this issue might be resolved? \n\nA: It seems that by upgrading Ubuntu to a newer version you also updated a kernel. GRUB sees both (actually, the log says that there are 3 kernels up, not sure why you see only two) kernels and identifies them as kernels for Ubuntu. It simply means that there's a different version of the engine.\nTo remove an older kernel, simply run apt-get autoremove[1] procedure on any of those Ubuntu instances. Most likely you'll also need administrative privileges for removing packets, thus the command would be sudo apt-get autoremove\n[1] - manual for apt-get states:\nautoremove\nautoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed \nto satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no more needed. \n\n\nA: I know this is old but I don't see a proper solution/answer yet and it shows up very early in recent google searches. The issue you're running into has nothing to do with redundant/old kernels and grub. This takes place before grub is loaded and you can see the different kernels displayed. \nIt's got to do with the way Ubuntu's UEFI install option works. The reason Ubuntu and a lot of other distro's create two entries in your UEFI/BIOS is because there's both a shimx64.efi and a grubx64.efi. It is seeing both of those files and displays an entry for each. The shimx64.efi has to do with secureboot and MS's signing BS. \nIf you're using secureboot then shimx64.efi (which was signed by Microsoft on the version Canonical supplies) is what would be used to boot and it slings itself over to grubx64.efi and then boots your OS. \nIf you're not using secureboot then shimx64.efi is not necessary and you would be able to boot just by using/selecting the grubx64.efi option. \nDepending on your setup you should be able to rename/remote shimx64.efi so you're not seeing the duplicate entry, otherwise unfortunately it's probably best to just ignore it. \n", "Q: ndiswrapper driver problem I'm trying to solve my wifi problem by installing the driver, for that i think i should install the windows driver using ndiswrapper, the problem is when i want to install the driver using this software, i should select an .inf file that i should find in the extracted files of the .exe driver, so the problem is i don't find the .inf file in the extracted package.\nI tried a lot of another Lenovo drivers (audio and video drivers) and i always don't find the .inf file, BUT when i try for example a HP driver i find the .inf file.\nI download the driver from Lenovo support website, should i download it from the official website or what is the problem? p.S i have a Broadcom chipset.\nThis is my configuration: Ubuntu 64-bit, Lenovo g510 i7\nThis is my network Card Detail:  Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n [14e4:4365] (rev 01)\n\nA: Assuming you are running Ubuntu 14.04 or later, I suggest you get a temporary internet connection, open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nReboot and your wireless should be working. \n", "Q: Cannot run bash script from crontab when it works from command line bash I have a strange problem of being to able to run a bash script from commandline but not from the crontab entry for root.

Ubuntu and Amazon.  Perhaps you restored settings from your browser or your sync brought your own phish back in.   \nBut no... Ubuntu is not conspiring with Amazon.  \nIm only responding because I think its awful bad decision making for Ubuntu to pollute the default setup with Amazon app.  When I noticed it I fervently ripped that amazon all out and sent it packing.

How do I open an application by a custom keyboard shortcut, like Ctrl+M for opening System Monitor?\n\nA: The first thing is that you have to know the command to run the application. Of many applications, the command is the same as the name of the application, as it appears in Dash, but that is definitely not always the case. \nFind the command to run an application\nTo find the command to run an application, you can look into its desktop file, located in /usr/share/applications; open the file with gedit (drop it over an open gedit window) and look for a line, starting with: Exec=. If you, for example, look into the file: /usr/share/applications/gnome-system-monitor.desktop, you will see that the command to run it is:\ngnome-system-monitor\n\nCreating a keyboard shortcut to run the application\nOpen \"System Settings\" > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".

I have an old Dell computer with an Intel Pentium R4 CPU clocked @ 2.80GHz. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: Check the top and see if you can reduce some of unused applications. Also a bug has been reported w.r.t to graphics https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-greeter/+bug/1292467\n\nA: That's a 10 year old single core CPU.  You're talking about Ubuntu with the Unity desktop?  That's designed for modern hardware.  It needs the same sort of power that Windows 7 or 8 does.\nYou read all kinds of stuff about Linux being great for old computers, and it is, but the part they don't tell you is that Linux technically is just the kernel.  That doesn't mean that the desktop ... or some app software ... will run properly on old hardware.\nOn old hardware you'd be better off doing a clean reinstall of Lubuntu 14.04.1.  Especially if there's less than 1GB of RAM.\n", "Q: What is a reliable, authoritative source to find out what the latest stable release of Ubuntu is? What is  a reliable, authoritative source to find out what the latest stable release of Ubuntu is (if there is one)? Ideally this should exist somewhere fixed on the web, and should always tell you what the current latest stable version of Ubuntu is.\nAt the moment http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop mentions 14.04 and doesn't mention 14.10, so one might think it's 14.04. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/ calls 14.04.1 the \"latest version\" (the distinction between 14.04 and 14.04.1 is not my point here). But http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.10/ doesn't mention \"beta\" or \"RC\" anywhere, which leads one to think it's the final release. But it's not clear if one is \"supposed\" to look at that page directly. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseNotes sounds like it's 14.10, but then it's a wiki page...\n(Note: the question is really what is stated in the first sentence, not \"what's the latest stable release right now?\")\n\nA: The site https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases pretty clearly indicates that 14.10 is a future release, which should indicate to you that this is not yet a stable version.  14.04 is listed as a current release, supported until April 2019 which should indicate to you that Canonical considers this to be a stable release.\n\nA: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nThat's my answer to this somewhat silly question. If there's a stable release it will be put on the downloads page when it's ready.\n", "Q: Picture: Stuck Screen (multiple colors) While Installing Any Distro I have Windows 8 installed on this machine, but suddenly wanted to switch to Ubuntu. I have tried installing all Ubuntu flavors (Xubuntu, Lubuntu... etc.) and for hours now I have been getting this screen. I booted from a USB drive, tried different software that make USB bootable (thinking one of them is faulty), tried x86 and x64, tried different USB drives, messed a little bit with my BIOS settings, but I keep getting the problem. I have tried to turn off UEFI, secure boot (both of which do not exist on this PC, since it does not use them). \n \n\nA: The boot menu offers a low graphics mode and even a text mode installer in case there's no working graphics driver included with the installation medium. It would be crucial to get your keyboard working so you can select the right mode. \nThe issue is usually a BIOS setting for “legacy“ USB devices, which you can read about in the manual of your computer/mainboard.\nInvestigate that issue on the internet, in particular the forums of your computer or mainboard manufacturer.\nAskUbuntu should have a bunch of related issues as well. Often just playing around with the few different USB options can solve the issue.\nAlternatively try a PS/2 keyboard, if you computer still has such a connector; USB keyboards often come with PS/2 adapters.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu 14.10 not yet available at the Ubuntu Official Site?

However it seems that it is available at torrent sites of Ubuntu. It is not available for upgrade either. What is going on? \n\nA: Here is the new release:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/14.10/\nHave fun!\n\nA: You can download/update to 14.10 - just read the release notes.\nIt will likely take time to update the main site and other areas.

The Cinnamon desktop environment has a feature of showing \"Recent Files\", how can this feature be disabled?\n\nA: Nowadays you can pull up the menu, type 'privacy' and click on the 'privacy' icon that should appear. Turn off 'remember recently accessed files'.\nThe previous solution before this was introduced in the GUI was the below, which should now be redundant and left for curiosity only:\n\nA simple hack to disable the feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the file containing a list of Recent Files: rm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\n*Create a new file that is completely empty: touch ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\n*Change the attribute of this file to \"immutable\", meaning that it \"cannot be modified, it cannot be deleted or renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data can be written to the file. Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute\": sudo chattr +i ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\n*The (empty) file is now immutable, meaning that the \"Recent Files\" feature is for all intents and purposes disabled, as no new list of recent files can be created.\n\n\nAlternately:\n\n\n*Create a folder named recently-used.xbel and set it read only.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to install 14.04 using the LiveUSB drivers? I run into all kinds of problems with hardware not working after install (specifically the touchpad and wifi), but everything works perfectly on the LiveUSB. Is there a setting to install to disk with those basic drivers? I'd rather just have these general drivers working and update each device individually later than try to troubleshoot every problem Ubuntu ends up with after install, especially when those problems prevent me from having a mouse pointer and an Internet connection.\nMy hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP Probook 4720s (originally a Windows 7 64-bit machine)\n\n*Core i5 2.5 Ghz Processor\n\n*4GB of RAM\n\n*Radeon 530v GPU\n\n*Synaptics Touchpad\n\n*Atheros Wireless Adapter\n\n\nFurther details: I'm attempting to install the latest 64-bit version of Ubuntu 14.04. I have done this both with and without updates via wi-fi during installation, with the same results. I'm using a Live Image on a 4 GB USB drive made using UNetbootin.\n\nA: As far as wireless card, you could use Ndiswrapper , which is basically a way to use windows driver for Ubuntu.  Refer for more info to this page: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper\nAs touchpad , I can suggest only a workaround: when I installed Ubuntu on Acer C720 chromebook it turned out that touch pad at the moment has no linux drivers at all, so I bought a wireless mouse - those suckers typically are plug and play - no need to install no driver, and it works all the same on Ubuntu,  Fedora,  and Mint that I have on my two laptops.  And windows too.\nIf your programming and script-fu is powerful enough you may write your own driver,  but really there should be something decent available in Linux world already.  Or maybe you could try looking for something close to your model and install a driver for that instead\n", "Q: Can't update `mysql-workbench` on Ubuntu 14.04 I want to install the new version of mysql-workbench (6.2).\nI can't update it with sudo apt-get install mysql-workbench.\nI think it's because that I have mysql-workbench 6 ; That is the newest version of it in the repository.  \nSo, now I want to know how can I install the newest version of a program with apt-get install.\nHow do we install a program from a repository? I mean, technically. Who updates the package in there? And when do they put the new version of a package there?\nThanks. \n\nA: apt-get install downloads and installs the version that is currently in the repository. To get updates you type apt-get upgrade which will install any updates that are released for Ubuntu and other installed applications.\nFew applications are kept up to date in the repositories; the web browser Firefox is one of them. Ubuntu takes what is in Debian Testing or Sid and keeps it at those package versions that works on a Ubuntu release. This keeps the system in a stable state. Security updates are usually provided to Ubuntu packages, but not new versions.\nTo get the newest version of applications you will need to find PPA's or backports. After adding either one you can then install the new application with apt-get install <new package>\n", "Q: What is a .bashrc file and what does it do? I can't seem to find any clear information on what the .bashrc file is and what it does exactly.\n\nThanks for all the help so far.  It seems that this script does everything from coloring, completion, aliases and shell history, etc.  Is there anything that does not seem useful?\n\nA: The .bashrc file is a script that is executed whenever a new terminal session is started in interactive mode. This is what happens when you open a new terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, or just open a new terminal tab. \nBy contrast a terminal session in login mode will ask you for user name and password and execute the ~/.bash_profile script. This is what takes place, for instance, when you log on to a remote system through SSH.\nThe .bashrc file itself contains a series of configurations for the terminal session. This includes setting up or enabling: colouring, completion, the shell history, command aliases and more. The .bashrc file distributed with Ubuntu is well commented and you will be able to understand most of what it does just by reading it.\nYou can tweak .bashrc to your liking. Here you can get an example with many extra features.\n", "Q: Trying to Download Xubuntu, but don't have dvd I am trying to ditch xp on my old computer, so I decided to switch it over to Xubuntu, which is supposed to be great for older hardware. However, I don't have a DVD-R available at this time. Is it possible to split the installation between multiple disks, as is done for large video games and the like?    \n\nA: See our help for a list of options on installing without a CD.

I'm wondering if we will see the Unity 7.3.1 release backported to 14.04 LTS release? I wanted to stick to the LTS right now, but with the HiDPI fixes I may have to upgrade.\n\nA: No, Unity 7.3.1 will not be backported to 14.04.\nThe good news is that, with the exception of changes made to build or run with newer versions of software in Ubuntu 14.10 (for example, compiling under GCC 4.9 instead of GCC 4.8, newer GTK+ libraries, etc.), almost all bugfixes have been backported to Unity 7.2 and SRU'd into 14.04.  There are no bugfixes for high-DPI that appear in 14.10 that have not been (or are not being) backported to 14.04.  We expect that to continue in the Vivid cycle.\nThe SRU process is a little slow:  fixed need to land in the current Ubuntu development version first and be tested, then a careful process of verification and validation must be followed before the change appears in 14.04.  \n\nA: Unity 7.3.1 has been ported to Ubuntu 14.04 by Doug McMahon (the person who is responsible for maintaining the Multimedia for Trusty PPA) in its PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~mc3man/+archive/ubuntu/trusty-prop\n", "Q: Performance loss after 30 minutes This one's baffled me. I have Ubuntu 14.04, 3 days ago (2014-20-10)  it started slowing down.\nI've reproduced it by opening gedit and then closing gedit, when the issue is active it hits roughly 2 seconds to close an empty file, whilst without the issue this is always instant - affects everything else in a similar manner.\ntop reports no unusual activity when the freeze occurs, htop the same, iotop the same as well. \nThe issue only arises after 30 minutes of uptime, I can guarantee that at 29mins of uptime I could not reproduce it, at 31 minutes of uptime I could reproduce this consistently (using above method, no apps started other than terminal and htop) and managed to repeat this 4 or 5 times (by shutting down, booting up and waiting half hour - which was enjoyable). \nThe issue persists even after reboots but can be reset by shutting down and powering back up, what part of Ubuntu holds state after reboots but not shutdowns?\nRelevant logs for this period are syslog, auth.log and Xorg.0.log (by examining contents of /var/log for time modified in specified range)\nsyslog:\nOct 22 17:21:36 raiden NetworkManager[1102]: <warn> nl_recvmsgs() error: (-33) Dump inconsistency detected, interrupted\nOct 22 17:39:01 raiden CRON[3284]: (root) CMD (  [ -x /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime ] && [ -x /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean ] && [ -d /var/lib/php5 ] && /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean /var/lib/php5 $(/usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime))\nOct 22 18:09:01 raiden CRON[3370]: (root) CMD (  [ -x /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime ] && [ -x /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean ] && [ -d /var/lib/php5 ] && /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean /var/lib/php5 $(/usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime))\n\nauthlog:\nOct 22 17:39:01 raiden CRON[3283]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)\nOct 22 17:39:01 raiden CRON[3283]: pam_unix(cron:session): session closed for user root\nOct 22 18:09:01 raiden CRON[3369]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)\nOct 22 18:09:01 raiden CRON[3369]: pam_unix(cron:session): session closed for user root\nOct 22 18:17:01 raiden CRON[3495]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)\nOct 22 18:17:01 raiden CRON[3495]: pam_unix(cron:session): session closed for user root\n\nXorg.0.log: (probably me just waking computer back up)\n[  3466.727] (II) intel(0): switch to mode 1366x768@60.0 on LVDS1 using pipe 0, position (0, 900), rotation normal, reflection none\n[  3466.880] (II) intel(0): switch to mode 1600x900@60.0 on VGA1 using pipe 1, position (0, 0), rotation normal, reflection none\n\nNone of those indicate anything bad and subsequent steps to reproduce the issue indicate no changes to the logs so these were most likely just innocent logs.\nI presume there's 3 possible sources of this problem:\nSoftware install: I installed something dodgy\nI did: \n\n\n*\n\n*history | grep apt-get' - no installs in that time period\n\n*Looked at synaptic package manager history - nothing in that time period\n\n*Software centre history - last update was several weeks before (there was a dependency issue so I hadn't done any updates in a while)\n\n*I installed Skype for Ubuntu around that time period but there's no indication it's caused by Skype (removed it anyway)\n\n\nCron job going wrong\nChecked cronjobs in crontab, /etc/cron.d /etc/cron.daily and hourly nothing indicating it's something in there only a PHP cron job occurs every 30 minutes but if it were cron it would do it at certain points around the clock not 30 minutes after startup.\nAnalysing new processes that have been started between non-slowdown state and slowdown state suggest no new processes are started, (first test this showed up a kworker thread but this is likely to just be a coincidence). I presume this must mean it's either an existing process that triggered it or something else.\nMalware\nDue to it's elusiveness and the mysterious 30 min absence of the issue (30 minutes seems like a human-chosen amount of time) I began to think it could be some kind of malware however unlikely it could be (hadn't done an update for a while and have a few open ports). So ran rkhunter (rootkit finder) but nothing untoward was found.\nOther things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unticking certain compiz components - no change\n\n*Restarting compiz - no change\n\n*Unticking all compiz components - no change (except for me wrestling to get the computer usable again)\n\n*Playing various musical instruments whilst waiting for uptime to get to 30 minutes and then watching the results of top and htop for any suspicious changes - nothing odd\n\n\nHas anyone had anything similar to this happen to them or could point me in the right direction if you do I'll hit the up vote button repeatedly on your answer (I'll make sure it's an odd number)\n\nA: There are some ways to configure cron to run a job 30 minutes after startup. Jenkins does that by hashing the function and using H/30 * * * * for example. It could also be a thread sleeping for 30 minutes and spawning a silent cpu killer process.\nSome ideas there :\nDid you try htop as root? Some processes may be invisible, I've seen this on Debian especially.\nDid you try to logout / log back in when the issue occurs? Could be the window manager or a session problem.\nIf logout/login does not work, you can try to restart your session manager. I think it's lightdm by default so sudo service lightdm restart should do it. \n\nA: This was caused by SMART data being enabled for the drive in question. \nDisabling SMART data solved this :\nsudo smartctl --smart=off /dev/sda\n\nPresumably it kept rerunning some kind of internal self-test 30 minutes after the disk spun up and got into a loop; as this was at the hardware layer the rest of the computer was unaware of it going on hence I could see no process in particular responsible for IO blocking and no processes hogging resources.\n", "Q: Setting up HybridGraphics on Dell xps 15z (L511z) Ubuntu 14.04 Few days ago I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Dell xps 15z (L511z) laptop. First problem I encountered was with installation (from CD) not willing to start. With acpi=off selected installation always stopped on the last step - copying installation logs, so I had to install with nomodeset selected. \nAfter the install finished successfully only resolution I could chose was 1280x1024 (5:4). I tried installing nvidia-331 driver together with nvidia-settings and nvidia-prime, reboot the system and Ubuntu freezes after log-in screen (I can only see Ubuntu 14.04 wallpaper and move cursor around, but no desktop loads). With ctrl + alt + F1 and \nsudo prime-switch intel\n\nI managed to switch to intel graphics which allowed me to log in normally. Resolution is still 1280x1024 (5:4) with additional choice of 1024x768 (4:3), which is nothing near my screen resolution 1920x1080 (16:9). When I start Nvidia X server settings I can see only 2 tabs: application profiles, nvidia-settings Configuration. And  if I try to switch back to nvidia card with\nsudo prime-swich nvidia\n\nI get the same freezing after log-in.\nCan anybody help me pls, because I've been struggling with this HybridGraphics for few days and didn't get any results?\nLaptop specs:\nCPU: Intel Core i7 (2nd Gen) 2640M / 2.8 GHz\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GT 525M\n\n\nA: This is a bit late but I will still post this answer so that other people can see, since I spent a good 24 hours looking for the solution.\nI have the exact same laptop and exact same problem. The full solution (for Fedora) can be found here: http://www.forum.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=289685.\nThe most important thing is to realize that you need to get rid of the nomodeset option since that prevents ubuntu from loading your intel (or any other) drivers. It is necessary during installation but only hurts after that.\nWith that in mind, the solution is to edit the /etc/default/grub file by editing the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX variable to the following:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_osi=linux noapic nolapic i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 i915.lvds_downclock=1 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 pcie_aspm=force\"\nSome of the options may not be necessary but I am too tired to try to figure out what each one does.\nNow you need to do sudo update-grub, restart, and then you can use your native resolution.\n\nA: I used a Dell XPS15z (L511z) laptop with Ubuntu 14.04 and the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in /etc/default/grub file is as follows:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_osi=linux nolapic i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 i915.lvds_downclock=1 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 pcie_aspm=force\"\n\nIn this setting, the Ubuntu is able to boot with minidisplay and HDMI ports working, while only one core is detected by the system since nolapic prevents going into SMP mode. \nHowever, when I remove nolapic, Ubuntu will not be able to boot normally but to boot through the recovery mode. All of the four cores can be detected, while the mini display and HDMI ports fail to work properly. Hope this helps. \n\nA: I added the following slight variation found in a feodora article (yes, working for ubuntu!) with success:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_osi=linux noapic nolapic rd.md=0 rd.lvm=0 rd.dm=0 $([ -x /usr/sbin/rhcrashkernel-param ] && /usr/sbin/rhcrashkernel-param || :) rd.luks=0 vconsole.keymap=us rhgb i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 i915.lvds_downclock=1 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 pcie_aspm=force\"\n\n", "Q: Locating the GRUB partition Prior to making some changes with GParted, I observe my disk in both GParted and the Ubuntu \"Disks\" utility. It appears I have only one partition marked with the boot flag in GParted (and having the bootable property \"on\" in the \"Disks\" utility view). Is that an indication that this partition is where GRUB is located?\nMotivation: My disk/system had the following history: Windows 7 --> Wubi install of Ubuntu --> migration script for migrating from Wubi to regular Ubuntu installation, dual boot included. I would like to scratch my Windows partition and reuse it as a new data partition for Ubuntu, avoiding a non-bootable machine situation in the process.\n\nA: No, some boot loaders like Windows' rely on the boot flag, because it simply passes control to the partition boot sector. \nBut Grub does not require this; it knows which partition contains additional grub modules and the config file and loads them based on that information rather than the presence or absence of a boot flag.\nIf you run the bootinfoscript it will tell you more information about your system, including where Grub loads it's files from. Usually Grub will locate this partition based on its UUID, so modifying other partitions doesn't affect booting. But if Grub is booting with the partition number, deleting or adding partitions may result in boot problems.\nI would recommend having an Ubuntu bootable USB available so that you can reinstall Grub if required.\nQ. How does the BIOS know it should run Grub?\nFor BIOS based (not EFI) computers, BIOS looks to the MBR (master boot record) to find the main bootloader and partition table. This is where Grub is installed (or the windows boot loader). The problem with this is that the space is very limited so the functionality of the bootloader is too. For Windows' bootloader that's okay because it does little more than pass on control, but Grub takes a different approach and loads up additional modules as required directly from it's /boot partition.\nIf you look at the results of the bootinfoscript it tells you what is installed in the MBR as in: \n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => Windows is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda.\n\nor \n => Grub2 (v1.99) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda and looks at sector 1 of \n    the same hard drive for core.img. core.img is at this location and looks \n    for (,msdos5)/boot/grub on this drive.\n\n", "Q: Virtualbox didn't survive upgrade from 14.04 to 14.10 Normally, when I upgrade from one version of Ubuntu to another, my virtual box virtual machines survive the upgrade.\nHowever, after upgrading from 14.04 to 14.10, they did not. I submitted a bug here, which provides this screenshot.\nAnyway, I'm not sure I understand how to get this back going again. I uninstalled virtual box and reinstalled it like this:\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox ; sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nThis didn't achieve anything. It seems like the fix is more involved than this. Please advise.\n\nA: This answer is a self answer that the OP has posted as an \"update\" section in the question.\n(@LonnieBest If you post a real self answer, leave a comment on this, and I delete it.)\n\nThanks to this post, I fixed this with the following command(s):\nsudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\n(took effect after reboot)\n\nA: I had a similar issue. However my kernel was the current version. The resolution to my problem was to go to Virtual Box site and download and run in Virtual Box the current extension pack.\n", "Q: Is there any way that windows can access my home folder? Is there any way that windows could access my home folder when dual-booting?\nI can't put my home folder on an NTFS partition, and Windows can't read or write to the default ext4 file system, and I don't know any file system that both windows and linux can read and write to and you can put your home folder on. And putting the files on my windows partition in ubuntu would not really be ideal, I basically want my personal for windows and ubuntu to be the same folder so when I make a change on one OS it will be saved on the other OS. Although files like config files and browser profiles would be seperate from each OS.\n\nA: Ext2Read works well. It can also open & read disk images ( eg: Wubi disk images)\n\nExt2Read is an explorer like utility to explore ext2/ext3/ext4 files.\n  It now supports LVM2 and EXT4 extents. It can be used to view and copy\n  files and folders. It can recursively copy entire folders. It can also\n  be used to view and copy disk and file\n\n\nHowever, it doesn't support removable devices. It only supports internal HDD devices. For external and removable, get Linux Reader by Diskinternals\n\nA: Windows and Linux can both read/write to FAT32 file systems. However, FAT32 file systems have the limitation that any single file can only be approx 4 GB in size, as a maximum.\nAlternatively there are ways to read EXT file systems via windows. Be careful: I tried this way once and all I got was blue screens in windows.\n\nA: While it's difficult to impossible to have a Unix user home on a NTFS file system, it's still possible for Ubuntu/Linux to read from and write to them. If you want the convenience of having the same directory structure on Linux and Windows you can\n\n\n*\n\n*automatically mount the NTFS file system on boot¹, and\n\n*create symbolic links in your Linux home directory to folders in your Windows home directory, e. g. by either\n\n\n*\n\n*dragging them to the destination in Nautilus, holding Alt while releasing them, and selecting Create link, or\n\n*in menu bar of Nautilus selecting Edit > Create link.\n\n\n\nSince Windows has symbolic links too, technically the same can be done with reversed roles and Ext2Fsd. Unfortunately the ext file system driver for Windows isn't nearly as well maintained and stable as the NTFS driver for Linux and write support is experimental for ext4 and will likely eat your data.\n¹ Ask me about it in the comments if you don't know and can't find how to do that.\n", "Q: Setup resolvconf to query specific dns server based on domain?

How to search for them and delete them from folder A? A perl script or something would be ideal since I don't like to download a software for this task. \n\nA: The program findimagedupes should do what you request:\n\nFinds visually similar or duplicate images\n\nThe program is a simple perl program and can be started from the command line - but is also available as a software package.\n\nA: you could use the program fslint\nit searches for duplicates (among other things)\nfslint can be downloaded in the software center. fslint has a user interface when you open the program, the first tab is about finding duplicata. you can specify the folder/folders.\nmore information : user manual fslint \n\nA: Try this command:\nfind . -type f -exec cmp -s '{}' \"$destdir/{}\" \\; -exec echo mv -v \"$destdir/{}\" \"$ToDelete\"/ \\;\n\nHow to use?\nStep 1: Make a temporary directory to moving duplicate files into that:\nToDelete=/tmp/ToDelete; mkdir -p \"$ToDelete\"\n\nStep 2: Set destdir to your FolderA directory which we want to delete duplicate photos from there.\ndestdir=/path/to/FolderA\n\nStep 3 cd to your first source directory(FolderB) and run the command\ncd /path/to/FolderB\n\nfind . -type f -exec cmp -s '{}' \"$destdir/{}\" \\; -exec echo mv -v \"$destdir/{}\" \"$ToDelete\"/ \\;\n\nStep 4: Now cd to your next source directory(FolderC) and run again the command\ncd /path/to/FolderC\n\nfind . -type f -exec cmp -s '{}' \"$destdir/{}\" \\; -exec echo mv -v \"$destdir/{}\" \"$ToDelete\"/ \\;\n\nOk. Now if you test the command and see the result, so remove the echo command to moving the duplicate photos into /tmp/ToDelete directory.\nSee the test below:\n$ ls ~/FolderA    \n  1.jpg  2.jpg  6.jpg  7.jpg  8.jpg\n\n$ ls ~/FolderB    \n  3.jpg  4.jpg  5.jpg  7.jpg  8.jpg  9.jpg\n\n$ ls ~/FolderC\n  6.jpg  7.jpg  8.jpg  9.jpg\n\n$ ToDelete=/tmp/ToDelete; mkdir -p \"$ToDelete\"\n$ ls /tmp/ToDelete/\n$ destdir=~/FolderA\n\n$ cd ~/FolderB\n/FolderB$ find . -type f -exec cmp -s '{}' \"$destdir/{}\" \\; -exec mv -v \"$destdir/{}\" \"$ToDelete\"/ \\;\n  ‘/home/Fischer/FolderA/./8.jpg’ -> ‘/tmp/ToDelete/8.jpg’\n  removed ‘/home/Fischer/FolderA/./8.jpg’\n  ‘/home/Fischer/FolderA/./7.jpg’ -> ‘/tmp/ToDelete/7.jpg’\n  removed ‘/home/Fischer/FolderA/./7.jpg’\n\n/FolderB$ cd ~/FolderC\n/FolderC$ find . -type f -exec cmp -s '{}' \"$destdir/{}\" \\; -exec mv -v \"$destdir/{}\" \"$ToDelete\"/ \\;\n  ‘/home/Fischer/FolderA/./6.jpg’ -> ‘/tmp/ToDelete/6.jpg’\n  removed ‘/home/Fischer/FolderA/./6.jpg’\n\n/FolderC$ ls /tmp/ToDelete/\n  6.jpg  7.jpg  8.jpg\n\n/FolderC$ ls -l ~/FolderA\n  1.jpg  2.jpg\n\n/FolderC$ C00L ;)\n\nAnd How it works?\nWhen you switch into your FolderB or FolderC and you run find command, so you are looking for any file in it (. refer to current directory) and then with cmp command(used to compare two files byte by byte) you compare each files({}) in FolderB/FolderC with files in destdir(FolderA($destdir/{})) if they are the same then we move that file(from FolderA to temp directory in /tmp/ToDelete) with next mv command -exec mv \"$destdir/{}\" \"$ToDelete\"/ \\;.\n\nA: if it's a small number of photos, you could use nautilus or another file manager\n\n\n*\n\n*go to the parent folder of A, B, C\n\n*search for .jpg (or the file extension of your pictures: .png, .gif, ...)\n\n*sort alphabetically (make sure to view the sourcepath of the file)\n\n*delete the duplicate files you don't need anymore\n\n\nA: There are many duplicate photo finder utilities available online.

I would like to remove Swap usage:     0% from this message, as it could cause confusion. I don't know what is the best way to go about doing this, any suggestions?\n\nA: One way to do so would be to disable the sysinfo plugin that handles swap usage. Unfortunately, the plugin that shows swap usage also handles the memory usage, so disabling it disabled both:\n$ landscape-sysinfo  --exclude-sysinfo-plugins=Memory\n  System load: 0.0                Users logged in:     3\n  Usage of /:  56.0% of 15.62GB   IP address for eth0: 10.1.1.1\n  Processes:   202\n\n  Graph this data and manage this system at:\n    https://landscape.canonical.com/\n\nThis can be set for the MOTD using the /etc/landscape/client.conf configuration file:\n[sysinfo]\nexclude_sysinfo_plugins = Memory\n\nThe other way would be to process the output of /usr/bin/landscape-sysinfo by editing /etc/update-motd.d/50-landscape-sysinfo (which is actually a symlink to a file in /usr/lib, so your changes may be lost when you upgrade). Something like:\n/usr/bin/landscape-sysinfo | sed 's/Swap usage: *[0-9]+%//'\n\nThis would also lead to ugly output if there's one more item in the list (like a second network interface).\nAs Kevin points out, for the specific case of no swap, the output can be tidied up and the expression simplified:\n/usr/bin/landscape-sysinfo | sed 's/Swap usage: *0% *//'\n\nThis should shift any entry next to Swap entry to where the Swap entry was.\n", "Q: Flash doesn't work in firefox after upgrade Kubuntu to 14.10 I upgraded Kubuntu 14.04-x64 to 14.10.

Is this fixable and should I make a bug-report about this to Launchpad also?\nEDIT: Also worth noting this quote from Plymouth's wiki: \n\nNote that on Ubuntu, Plymouth is considered to be the \"owner\" of the\n  console device (/dev/console) so no application should attempt to\n  modify terminal attributes for this device at boot or shutdown.\n\nAs I understand it, no other application should interfere with what is displayed by Plymouth.\n\nA: Have you tryed to reinstall the Plymouth from the drop shell, or enter in the terminal:\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure Plymouth\n\nand you can also type in the terminal:\n sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nit might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Folders to Backup I have a 1TB external hard drive that I use to back up my entire computer.  Right now, I have every one of the folders under my computer set to back up, that is, /home, /usr, etc.  (Except /media, obviously, since that location would include my hard drive itself.)  My reason for this is extensive backup that I've had files in /etc or /usr get corrupted and then suddenly my display server was irreparably not working.  I had to reinstall Ubuntu.  But that's besides the point...\nI've been using Ubuntu for quite some time, but I still have no idea what each of these folders means.  Right now, every time duplicity attempts a backup, it gets stuck on a certain file under /proc.  Using nautilus, it shows the file is 0B and is empty when it is opened with gedit.  The backup hangs there for quite some time (at least 15 minutes) and eventually reports out that the backup failed.  \nWhat are my options here?  Should I delete all backups from my HD and try again?  Is /proc un-backupable?  Is there another program other than the default backup (duplicity or deja-dup I think it's called) that I should be using for such an extensive backup?\nThanks!\n\nA: /proc is a virtual filesystem that represents the state of the live system, including processes and their virtual memory maps, so, yes, it's inappropriate to back it up unless you're debugging the kernel or something.  Other such runtime-only virtual filesystems are /sys, /run, and /dev.\nGiven your existing back up contains some garbage from /proc and perhaps the other filesystem components when you last tried, I'd at least delete those components of the backup if you can, and try again, this time without them.  Deja-dup should be fine (personally I'm still using rsync on the command line from what I learned back in the day).\n", "Q: Disable Control+Alt+End Background\nIn xfce4, pressing Ctrl+Alt+End hotkey cycles to the next workspace.

Just tested my ram with memtest86. Got about 24K errors but I don't have money to buy new RAM!!! I'm just 13 years old. Do you still use your PC if your RAM is dead? And how do I repair this RAM stick?\n\nA: You can tell the Linux kernel to exclude some memory regions on its command line. Excerpt from the kernel parameter documentation:\n\nmemmap=nn[KMG]$ss[KMG]\n        [KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as reserved.\n        Region of memory to be reserved is from ss to ss+nn.\n        Example: Exclude memory from 0x18690000-0x1869ffff\n                 memmap=64K$0x18690000\n                 or\n                 memmap=0x10000$0x18690000\n\n\nIf you write down the exact location of the corrupted memory region from memtest86+ you can then use that info as described above and add a parameter to the kernel boot options.\nBe aware that memory corruptions can occur (apparently) randomly! Run the memory test at least twice to assure that the corrupted region is (most likely) always the same.\n\nA: Once RAM fails, there is no real way to repair it short of remanufacturing it. If you use your computer with a bad RAM stick, you will experience odd lockups and errors at best. At worst, your computer will fail to boot at all.\nMy recommendation, if you have more than one stick of RAM in your computer, is to test each stick separately to narrow down which stick is giving you trouble. Once you remove that particular stick (if only one has issues) you will be OK. If you do this, just remember to take ESD precautions to avoid damaging other components. Otherwise, your best bet is to try to find a cheap stick of RAM on eBay or something.\n", "Q: Having trouble reassigning keys Trying to rebind keys so that I can use my Dell XPS 12 in tablet mode optimally.\n\n\n*\n\n*Want to rebind the left Windows key and trick the system into thinking that it is the right windows key.

Today, my laptop rebooted, and when I launched the browser to a localhost domain, I got the following:\n\nWelcome to nginx!\nIf you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed\nand working. Further configuration is required.\nFor online documentation and support please refer to nginx.org.\nCommercial support is available at nginx.com.\nThank you for using nginx.\n\nI have no idea how/why nginx is appearing to be used.

(Please comment.) Does anyone know why Nginx was suddenly installed and how to get back to where I was at (Apache owning :80)?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: Since both nginx and apache use port 80, there's a race condition here during start up. If nginx starts up first, Apache fails and vice-versa. So either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove nginx: sudo apt-get remove nginx - better option, since you apparently don't need it.\n\n*Change /etc/nginx/sites-available/default so that it doesn't use port 80:\nlisten   8080;\n# or any unused port\n\n\nA: It sounds like your machine is compromised. Stop using it. Do not log in to email or banks. It's tough to know how badly you're compromised. Is someone targeting you specifically? Are they just looking for a spam host? A node for ddosing? There may now be software keyloggers capturing every username and password you type. Or maybe just rogue web and mail servers.\nIf you already have a livecd, boot from that and nuke the drive(s). You have backups of your data, right? If you don't already have a livecd, decide how paranoid you are. Do you trust your machine to correctly download a livecd? An attacker with root access can spoof secure websites (for users on that machine).\nOf course, there are more benign options, like someone you trust has access to the machine and installed nginx. *shrug*\n", "Q: Locate two variable strings and write one as a file I have a text document that contains 2 lines of information.  Line 1 contains a filename, and line 2 contains an reference ID.  The document contains additional strings other than the desired information and I'm trying to come up with a non-cluttered way to collect only the information that I desire.  Using 'cut -d' a bunch of times seems sloppy.\nHere is an example of my data\n12:\"content\":\"file;\\r\\n\\tfilename=\\\"TestingFile.txt\"} \n13-\"refid\":\"9B46BCAEDC9923\"}]\n\nUsing that information, I want to create a file called TestingFile.txt and write the refid value as the contents -- basically the values between the \" \" and nothing more.  \ntfilename=\\\"  and refid\":\"  will always precede the data I'm looking to grab, and there will always be a few characters following the final \" on the line.  \n\nA: awk -F'\"' 'NR==1 {fname=$(NF-1);} NR==2{print $(NF-1) >fname;}' file\n\nExplanation\nawk implicitly loops through every line of a file.  Each line is divided into fields.\n\n\n*\n\n*-F'\"'\nThis makes the a double-quote character function as the field separator.  Looking at the sample input, that means that the fields that we want will be the second to last on each line\n\n*NR==1 {fname=$(NF-1);}\nThe first line has the filename.  In awk, NF is the number of fields on a line.  So, $(NF-1) references the second to last field.  Its content is saved into the variable fname.\n\n*NR==2{print $(NF-1) >fname;}\nThe second line has the ID as its second to last field.  We print this ID to a file named fname.\nExample\nIf the above code is run against the sample input, a file TestingFile.txt is created in the current directory:\n$ cat TestingFile.txt\n9B46BCAEDC9923\n\nMore complex input\nSuppose that the input file looks like:\n12:\"content\":\"file;\\r\\n\\tfilename=\\\"TestingFile.txt\",\"date\":\"2014-10-23\"} \n13-\"refid\":\"9B46BCAEDC9923\",\"author\":\"Anon\"}]\n\nSince our data will no longer be the second to last fields, we need to change the awk code:\nawk -F'\"' 'NR==1 {sub(/.*tfilename=\\\\\"/, \"\");fname=$1;} NR==2 {sub(/.*refid\":\"/,\"\");print $1>fname;}' file2\n\nThis code removes all characters before the filename (line 1) or ID (line 2).  Once this has been done, the information that we want will be in field 1.  The code is otherwise the same.\n", "Q: Unable to install windows driver for Belkin n600 DB I put together a linux computer from an old ATX desktop. It is an MB ASROCK|B85M PRO4 LGA1150 board with an Intel i5 4460 3.2G 6M R chip (i686). Forgive me, I am not the most tech savvy, but I'm trying. \nSo, I'm in the basement, and I tried fishing ethernet cable down, but this house is from the 30s and I'm not having much luck. I went to buy a wireless card, only to find that best buy only carries wireless USB sticks. So, I bought one, only to find out that it only has Windows drivers (I love and hate how my projects can become so labyrinthine from moment to moment).  So online, I find that I need to install and use the NDISWrapper program. I think I have it installed, but now I am stuck. How do I install the Windows Belkin driver? I'm a total amateur-hour case and probably need my hand held through the command line stuff. The last time I used the command line was in MS-DOS in 1993, and my old DOS commands don't work here!\nThanks. \n\nA: Ubuntu should recognize your wifi usb stick. If it's not for some odd reason, I'd suggest you exchange it for Wifi extender, or Wall-plug range extender (one that you plugin into power outlet in one room and another one plug in the basement). Both of those options will allow you to connect via ethernet cable and it should work 100%. Plus you'll get a better speed/link if you use power wall plug extender.\n", "Q: My custom launchers are highlighted in Docky when Chrome is launched I've had this problem for a while, but for some reason it just irritated me more than usual today. \nI have Google Chrome pinned to Docky, as well as several custom launchers for various programs not installed via the repositories.\nHowever, when I launch Chrome, its icon is not highlighted; instead, several (but not all, which is weird) of my custom launcher icons pinned to Docky are highlighted and behave as though they were Chrome, i.e. I click on them and it takes me to the active Chrome window, and right clicking them only brings up Chrome options. Additionally, clicking on the Chrome icon again opens a new window.\nHere is a picture of Docky when Nautilus and Chrome (from which I am typing this) are the only programs currently running:\nFrom the picture, the three icons highlighted are Nautilus, the custom launcher that looks like Mars, and the custom launcher directly to the left of the trash icon. There are six other custom icons pinned that aren't highlighted, and, of course, Chrome is not highlighted. \nWhen Chrome is not running, these custom launchers launch their intended programs, are highlighted, and behave as they should.\nFrom my research on Ask Ubuntu, I noticed there seem to be a lot of issues with Chrome and Docky, but I haven't found a reference to my particular issue. Has anyone else experienced this or have a potential fix? I've tried reinstalling both Docky and Chrome on several occasions which doesn't seem to help...\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Some icon conflicts can be resolved by dragging the icons for the programs you need from the /usr/share/applications directory into Docky.

I have a laptop with a 3200x1800 screen. When I start up my laptop, lightdm doesn't scale to the resolution and looks tiny. When I lock the screen afterwards, lightdm scales and looks fine. I found this bug report but no solution.\n\nA: I've found a small fix that seems to work on login, but not on the lock screen. This solution also makes the top bar a little botched as the text is to big for the confinds - perhaps a costum theme would be the best solution? Also it's probably reliant upon the desktop already having set the Xft.dpi value highger.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and run xrdb -query | grep dpi\n\n*Open /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.unity-greeter.gschema.xml\n\n*Find by key-name=\"xft-dpi\" type=\"d\"\n\n*Replace the default value with the DPI from the xrdb output\n\n\nThis should go in effect instantly (logging out shows the larger text on my side).\n\nA: The solution appears to be mimicking what Ubuntu's 'Screen Displays' application does to scale the UI when you're logged in. I tracked the two settings required down. I made a script to automatically set this for my user for when I'm logged in (i.e. not unity-greeter), but you can use the same settings to alter unity-greeter.\nI have 2 4K displays, and wanted to have them both set with a scaling factor of 2, this is what my script looks like:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -e\n\n# Find connected displays, we're assuming that all of the \n# connected displays will require scaling.\nfunction createScaleFactor() {\n    SCREENS=$(xrandr --query | grep \" connected\" | awk '{ print $1 }')\n    FACTORS=$(for SCREEN in ${SCREENS}; do printf \"'${SCREEN}': 16, \"; done)\n\n    echo \"{${FACTORS::-2}}\"\n}\n\n# Set both gnome and ubuntu interface scaling.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 2\ngsettings set com.ubuntu.user-interface scale-factor \"$(createScaleFactor)\"\n\nRight at the end there you can see the two settings you need to change. So, to change them for unity-greeter (i.e. lightdm), you need to be logged in as lightdm. You can use dconf-editor to do this:\n$ sudo xhost +SI:localuser:lightdm\n$ sudo su -s /bin/bash lightdm\n$ dconf-editor\n\nOnce you see dconf-editor, navigate to the two keys in the above script, and set them to the values you need. If you've run that script above, you can open dconf-editor normally, and just grab the values it generated and set for you and copy them into the dconf-editor instance that's running as lightdm.\nJust to put the icing on the cake, this solution also doesn't make anything look weird. The entire thing scales properly, without the text looking abnormally large for the UI or anything like that. Some of the images are not quite as sharp as they could be, but you could customise those if you wanted, and perhaps they'll be updated to higher resolution images in the future.\nIdeally, in a future update either there'd be an option to set this, or it would automatically detect it (perhaps in a similar way to how it sets the user wallpaper).\n\nA: The other answers are fine. However they will only scale the fonts. This will cause unevenness between fonts and other elements. You should scale the whole display. For this you need to run a script when lightdm starts and set scaling with xrandr. You can find the details here:\nhttp://evren-yurtesen.blogspot.fi/2017/10/lightdm-and-4k-displays.html\n", "Q: email - Postfix name issue with using $header \"name \" I've set up Postfix on my Ubuntu+Nginx machine to send mail and I'm running in to one issue.\nThe issue is that the from name is www-data with the email www-data@ip-123-45-67-890.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal.\nAs this is a \"send to a friend\" form, the from name should be the $_POST['sendername'] so the email is sent and shows up as coming from the sending user and their email, and cannot be hard-coded in /etc/postfix/main.cf or anywhere else as it's dynamic in that sense as per the above.\nEven testing the \"from\" header to a hard-coded value as you can see where I've commented out, it still doesn't appear as that from name and email.\nAny ideas?

Ubuntu 14.10 Utopic Unicorn released yesterday. I'm  using Ubuntu 14.04 since it released.\nI want to know what are the new features in 14.10 . Is it really effective to upgrade to 14.10 or 14.04 is best because it is LTS ?\nThrough searches I came to know few features like : \n1.Ubuntu 14.10 uses version 3.16 of the Linux kernel.\n2.There are also new versions of LibreOffice, the GNOME components.\nSo what an average user will get by upgrading to 14.10.\n\nA: Don't upgrade to 14.10 unless you are prepared to upgrade every six months. 14.10 and future releases until the next LTS only have security support for nine months. If you do not upgrade to each successive release on the 6-monthly schedule, you will end up without support.\nAnother good way of thinking about this is backwards. When was the last time you upgraded before 14.04? Was it more than six months ago? In that case, 14.10 is probably not for you.\nI say this because I see questions from users on older interim releases that are no longer supported. Since they did not upgrade on the six-monthly cadence, with hindsight they would clearly have been better off sticking to an LTS release.\n\nA: 14.04 is an LTS, meaning it will be supported for 5 years (until April 2019). This should cover security and critical fixes.\nSo, if this is a production machine in which you need stability over everything, or you are just not willing to upgrade every 6 months, just stick with the LTS.\nOtherwise, if you want the latest and greatest, and are willing to upgrade every 6 months, go for 14.10. It's working great in my machines.\nOn the question: \"what an average user will get by upgrading to 14.10\". Well, at a quick glance, not much. Mostly, more up to date versions of applications.\n", "Q: How to install QQ on Ubuntu 14.04? I'm a new learner of Ubuntu, installing Ubuntu 14.04 on my PC, but can't install QQ. How can I install it?\n\nA: QQ for linux has been stopped and not supported for  a long time already. There are implementations of QQ in WINE for Deepin and Ubuntu Kylin, but there is no (at least no more) Linux-version QQ. \nThere is also w.qq.com, which is a web-based version of QQ, however it's very limited\nBasic idea of my solution is to install Genymotion （ an Android emulator ) and install the Android version of QQ in there. Basic steps are: 1)install VirtualBox; 2) install genymotion; 2) add a device; 3) launch that device; 4) download *.apk file for mobile qq; 5) drag and drop to running android emulator\nStep 1 Install VirtualBox\nGenymotion uses VirtualBox as backend for virtualization. It will be important to install it.\nGo to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads  and download VirtualBox version for your OS version. \nIf your OS is 32 bit, download i386 package. If your os is 64 bit - install AMD64 package. (You can find out if you use 32 or 64 bit OSwith the arch or uname -m command; x86_64 means 64 bit, i368 and i686 mean 32 bit). \nDrag and drop the downloaded package to Software Center or open the terminal, go to the directory where the package is located with cd directory-name and  install the downloaded package with sudo dpkg -i virtualbox-*.deb\nFor example, my Ubuntu 14.04 is 64 bit, so I downloaded virtualbox-5.0_5.0.2-102096~Ubuntu~trusty_amd64.deb; it is saved in my Downloads folder. I install it with sudo dpkg -i virtualbox-5.0_5.0.2-102096~Ubuntu~trusty_amd64.deb\nStep 2 Install Genymotion\nGo to https://www.genymotion.com/ and create account. Genymotion for personal use is free. Download appropriate package for your OS version at https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download\nOpen the terminal and go to the directory where you downloaded the package. The installation binary will be something like this genymotion-2.5.2_x64.bin. In terminal , do chmod 755 genymotion-*.bin && ./genymotion-*.bin -d $HOME. There will be new directory created, called genymotion in your home directory. \nIf you prefer to install somewhere else, you can do ./genymotion-* -d /path/to/your/directory\nStep 3 Install virtual Android Phone\nGo to the folder where you installed Genymotion, launch it. Click ADD button. Select any android version, install it. Once installation is done, select that device and click START to launch it.\nStep 4 Download and Install Android QQ version\nFrom your Ubuntu web browser to http://im.qq.com/download/ and download the mobile version of QQ. The file should be mobileqq_android.apk\nOpen the file manager. Find the mobileqq_android.apk file. Drag and drop it into the running Android emulator. \nIf you receive an error about incompatible CPU, go back to Step 3 and try different device version.\nStep 5  Create a Desktop Shortcut [optional]\nOpen text editor and create genymotion.desktop. Contents are the following\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Genymotion\nExec=/home/user/genymotion/genymotion\nTerminal=false\n\nSave that file to desktop. In terminal , do chmod 755 $HOME/Desktop/genymotion.desktop\nExec= line is important. Make sure it says your actual username, instead of user. \nReferences:\nhttps://www.genymotion.com/#!/developers/user-guide\nHow can I install a .bin file?\nAn easy way to create a desktop shortcut?\n", "Q: How to save matched pattern into variable using 'sed' command? I'm trying to find a pattern using sed command in file.txt between first char1 and char2  and then replace that with string. like below with echo mode example:\necho \"This X is test Y. But X is not test Y.\" | sed 's/X[^Y]*Y/REPLACE/'\n\nAlso I need to save matched pattern( like is test {<--spaces around is important} ) in a variable.\n\nA: You have to accomplish that with a second sed command:\nvar=$(echo \"This X is test Y. But X is not test Y.\" | \\\ntee >(sed 's/X[^Y]*Y/REPLACE/' >/dev/stderr) | \\\nsed -r 's/[^X]*X([^Y]*)Y.*/\\1/')\n\nExlanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to use tee to split the stream. That both stdout and stderr contain the string.\n\n*tee needs a file as argument. We give tee a pipe where sed listens from and replaces the string.\n\n*sed prints the string to stderr: The output you see in the terminal.\n\n*The second sed command listens on stdout and extracts the needed string, that is now saved into the variable $var (the contect of stdout).\n\n\nUse that to check:\n$ echo \">$var<\"\n> is test <\n\n\nA: Here is a single invocation of sed that writes the revised line to stdout while at the same time saving the removed text in shell variable var:\n$ var=$(echo \"This X is test Y. But X is not test Y.\" | sed -nr 'h;s/[^X]*X([^Y]*)Y.*/\\1/;p;x;s/X[^Y]*Y/REPLACE/;w /dev/stderr') 2>&1\nThis REPLACE. But X is not test Y.\n\nThe value of var is:\n$ echo \"==$var==\"\n== is test ==\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*h\nThis command copies the current pattern to the hold space.\n\n*s/[^X]*X([^Y]*)Y.*/\\1/;p\nThis removes everything from the pattern space except the text between the first X and Y including any spaces.  This is then printed to stdout.  This is the output that is captured by the shell and assigned to var.\n\n*x\nThis copies the hold space back to the pattern space.  When this is done, the pattern space contains a copy of the original input line.\n\n*s/X[^Y]*Y/REPLACE/; w /dev/stderr\nThe substitution is made and the result is written to stderr.  \n\n*2>&1\nAfter the shell has captured stdout into var, this instructs the shell to copy stderr (which has the line with REPLACE) to stdout.\nAside on handling of variable var\nThe variable var includes the leading and trailing spaces.  If the shell were to subsequently subject var to word-splitting, these spaces would be removed.  To prevent that, when var is referenced, do so inside double-quotes, as in the example above.\n", "Q: how to partition my disk after i have installed ubuntu I'm a newbie. I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Dell Vostro 3446.\nI want to partition my storage so that after installing a different OS (if I ever need to do it), I don't lose data, similar to a separate partition in Windows for data files (C:\\ contains the OS files, and D:\\ contains data).\nI can't find any satisfactory/clear description on google search on how to do this. I have already read a lot of articles which describe how to do partitioning during installation but i want to partition after installing Ubuntu.

But you cannot tamper the partition on which the ubuntu is running. That means you need to boot from a live cd. Use a live cd or create bootable pendrive using lili. And boot from it. Then using GParted, you can edit the partitions. Feel free to delete create or shrink partition, but be carefull when you hit the apply button.

An article from itsfoss worked for me.\nBefore you try out the article, open up terminal and key in acpi_listen and then press your fn+up and fn+down key combinations to check whether your brightness keys are actually getting registered by Ubuntu or not.\n\nA: It worked by following the article Fix Brightness Control Not Working for Ubuntu 14.04 & Linux Mint 17!\nJust add the given data in the \"intel file\" when it's opened, copy paste, save the file, shutdown and start your system! :)\n\nA: I think this one is the easiest of all the solutions, and it provides you with a graphical icon to control brightness:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:indicator-brightness/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install indicator-brightness\n\nReference: Add Brightness Control to Ubuntu Desktop With This Handy App\n\nA: Save the following code as \"brightme\"\n#!/bin/bash\n\nBRIGHTNESS_PATH='/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness'\nMAXBRIGHTNESS=$(cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness)\nMINBRIGHTNESS=1\nNUMBER=$1\n#Check if integer\nInt='^[0-9]+$'\nif [[ $NUMBER =~ $Int ]]; then\n    if (( \"$NUMBER\" >= \"$MAXBRIGHTNESS\" )); then\n        NUMBER=$MAXBRIGHTNESS\n    elif (( \"$NUMBER\" < \"$MAXBRIGHTNESS\" )); then\n        NUMBER=$MINBRIGHTNESS\n    fi\n    if [[ \"$USER\" = \"root\" ]]; then\n        echo $NUMBER > $BRIGHTNESS_PATH\n    else\n        echo \"Run as root, use sudo\"\n    fi\nfi\necho \"Now the brightness is $(cat $BRIGHTNESS_PATH)\"\n\nThen give permission to this file\nchmod 777 brightme\n\nSave the file in local binaries\nsudo cp brightme /usr/local/bin\n\nNow you can use like this\nsudo brightme 65 #Any positive number as you wish \n\n\nA: Manually changing brightness\nRemember that on Linux/Unix everything is a file. Brightness value is also stored in a file. Open a command line ( aka Terminal) by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, or by searching 'terminal' application in the dash. Then execute these commands:cd /sys/class/backlight/. cd is basically used for navigating through directories. And under backlight for me there is folder acpi_video0, but for you it may be different. Use ls command to find out what folder name it is. cd to that folder as well. So for example, I would do as show in picture \n\nOK, so by now you have navigated to the folder which contains your brightness settings. Inside there is brightness file and max_brightness file. \ncat max_brightness will tell you the maximum brightness that you can set on the screen. brightness is the actual file  that controls brightness. You can change it from 0 to whatever number is in max_brightness. \n\nSee the number 7 after I did cat max_brightness ? This is my maximum brightness value, so it means i can change brightness from 0 to 7.\nNow we can edit brightness file to actually change screen brightness. We will need some text editor command. I prefer using command line text editor nano. So I would do \nsudo nano brightness\n\nIt will ask you for your password. Enter it, and you will see a screen something like this:\n\nDo you see where is my cursor? right after the number. That's what i mean when i said, don't hit enter. This file has to have only that one line, no other. You can use left/right keys to move cursor, and backspace or del keys to delete old number, and then type new. Remember, that you can only go from whatever number was in max_brightness file to 0.\nWhen you wrote new number, press Ctrl+X, it will ask if you want to \"Save modified buffer\". Press Y. Then it will asks what name of the file to write. Just press enter, we do not want to change name of this file. Done. At this point your brightness should change.\nSmall note on the side: The problem with graphic text editor like gedit, is that it tries to create a backup for every file, and brightness file and that folder has permissions such that only root can modify it, so it won't let gedit to change that file or create backup, even with gksudo - i tried\nScript version:\nThis script opens my brightness file with nano editor.

What does the apt-get install ... command do?\nWhen I enter apt-get install ... command, there are some texts appearing on the screen, but that does not have enough information for me. I want to know if any file is created / edited, any service is started and other activities...\nIs there any .sh file executed when the apt-get install ... run? If so, how can I see the content of that sh file?\nThe reason for this question is recently I tried to install tomcat7 with apt-get install tomcat7. Everything works fine until I install tomcat7-admin (manager web application), the server became unresponsive to any request. I tried this many times, and this always happen.\n\nA: Mostly, apt-get does the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*checks for dependencies (and asks to install them), \n\n*downloads the package, verifies it and then tells dpkg to install it.\n\n\ndpkg will:\n\n\n*\n\n*extract the package and copy the content to the right location, and check for pre-existing files and modifications on them,\n\n*run package maintainer scripts: preinst, postinst, (and prerm, postrm before these, if a package is being upgraded)\n\n*execute some actions based on triggers\nYou might be interested in the maintainer scripts, which are usually located at /var/lib/dpkg/info/<package-name>.{pre,post}{rm,inst}. These are usually shell scripts, but there's no hard rule. For example:\n$ ls /var/lib/dpkg/info/xml-core.{pre,post}{rm,inst}\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/xml-core.postinst\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/xml-core.postrm\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/xml-core.preinst\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/xml-core.prerm\n\n\nA: In short: apt-get install does everything that is needed that your system can successfully execute the new installed software application.\nLonger: \nPreliminaries:\nFrom the manpage: \n\nAll packages required by the package(s) specified for installation\n  will also be retrieved and installed.\n\nThose packages are stored on a repository in the network. So, apt-get downloads all the needed ones into a temporary directory (/var/cache/apt/archives/). They will be downloaded from a web- or a ftp-server. They are specified in the so called sources.list; a list of repositories. From then on they get installed one by one procedurally.\nThe first ones are the ones, that have no further dependencies; so no other package has to be installed for them. Through that, other packages (that had dependencies previously) have now no dependencies anymore. The system keeps doing that process over and over until the specified packages are installed.\nEach package undergoes an installation procedure.\nPackage installation:\nIn Debian-based Linux distributions, as Ubuntu, those packages are in a specified standardized format called: deb - The Debian binary package format.\nSuch a package contains the files to be installed on the system. Also they contain a control file. That file contains scripts that the packaging system should execute in a specific situation; the so called maintainer scripts. Those scripts are split in:\n\n\n*\n\n*preinst: before the installation of the files into the systems filehierarchy\n\n*postinst: after the installation\n\n*prerm: before the uninstallation\n\n*postrm: after the uninstallation\n\n\nThere is an interesting picture, showing the procedure of an installation of a new package:\n\nThere are also more control-files, the most important are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*control: A list of the dependencies, and other useful information to identify the package\n\n*conffiles: A list of config files (usually those in /etc)\n\n*debian-binary: contains the deb-package version, currently 2.0\n\n*md5sums: A list of md5sums of each file in the package for verifying\n\n*templates: A file with error descriptions and dialogs during installation\n\n\nA: For the actual under-the-hood  stuff, you'll need to grab the Apt source. Fairly simple if you have source repositories enabled:\napt-get source apt\n\nThe apt-get command itself lives in cmdline/apt-get.cc. It's a pain to read through but most of apt-get's actions are spelled out quite extensively in there. Installation however, is mapped through a DoInstall function which lives in apt-private/private-install.{cc,h}.\nYou have to remember that apt-get is merely one side of the coin.\ndpkg is handling the actual installation but DoInstall doesn't know about dpkg directly. apt-get is actually surprisingly package-manager agnostic. All the functionality is abstracted through apt-pkg/package-manager.cc\nI'm only looking briefly but even there I can't see where this actually attaches to the dpkg systems. Some of this seems to be autoconfigured through apt-pkg/aptconfiguration.cc but this is a deep well. You could spend days unravelling this.\nThe source documentation is good though. You could do worse things than to go through each file and read the header to work out what's actually happening.\n\nA: There are some fantastic answers here which are better than this short one, but something you might consider to help you get a better understanding of the changes made by a package manager is Docker. You can diff the changes made in a container using docker diff <container> and it will show you all of the changes. This is especially useful for taking a look under the hood to see what apt-get install does to a system. A quick search will get you several resources to help implement this.\n", "Q: xdg-open only opens a new tab in a new Chromium window despite passing it a URL When I am using xdg-open to open a link in Chromium, it just results in a new Chromium window with only the new tab page, with nothing else.\nFor example, xdg-open 'https://askubuntu.com' will just open a new Chromium window and won't open up AskUbuntu.\nIt just seems that the URL isn't being passed to Chromium, as invoking Chromium directly does work and opens the desired page: chromium-browser 'https://askubuntu.com' works.\nObviously, Chromium is the default browser.\nWhere could the problem be, and how can I fix that? It is especially annoying when some programs use xdg-open to open a link and you can't go to the page you want, or even see what was opened.\n\nA: The issue is indeed that xdg-open does not pass the requested URL to Chromium, so instead of running chromium-browser url-here, it is executing chromium-browser which just opens a new window.\nAfter searching on the Internet, I found out that xdg-open uses some \"config\" files located in /usr/share/applications.\n/usr/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop seemed to be correct, as it is configured to pass the URL to Chromium correctly:\n$ grep Exec /usr/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop\nExec=chromium-browser %U\n...\n\nSo what was wrong? It turns out that there's another location which xdg-open uses and that has priority over /usr/share/applications.\n$ grep Exec ~/.local/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop\nExec=/usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser --use-system-title-bar --ppapi-flash-path=/usr/lib/pepflashplugin-installer/libpepflashplayer.so --ppapi-flash-version=14.0.0.125\n\nI have no idea as to why there's another chromium-browser.desktop, but note that this Exec line does not pass the URL; it is missing the %U. So I simply appended %U to this line. This instantly fixed all issues with xdg-open and Chromium.\n", "Q: Viber icon blocking the \"x\" It's a known problem, but the standard solution doesn't seem to work for me any more.\nYou can see the problem and the usual solution here:\nViber notification is not in the right position\nIt helped me fix the problem on Ubuntu 14.04, but today I have updated to 14.10, and the viber icon is now back on the same spot, blocking the \"x\", and the solution posted in that post doesn't seem to work anymore. Has anyone managed to move the icon on 14.10? \n\nA: The fix for Ubuntu 14.10 appears to be in a different repository than the fix for Ubuntu 14.04\nEnter the following in a terminal:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:gurqn/systray-utopic\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen log out and log back in again.\n", "Q: how to make scripts which will run on installation of apt package I have created a bash script which will store some data into a mysql database. Then I have created deb file with that script and made it available for installation by creating local apt repository.\nNow, I can install that package in any system(apt-get install packgename), but the problem is, I have to manually create the mysql database for that script after each installation on each system.\nIs there any way so that I can run a script for creating mysql database(as it is a one time requirement for a system) during the installation itself. I have heard something like post and pre scripts but not getting any idea on googling. Could you guys give some good tutorials for that ?\n\nA: Lets assume you have your .deb-file local (If not you can download it via apt-get download package).\nUnpack your deb file:\nar x package.deb\n\nInside the current folder there are now a few files. data.tar.gz is the file with the package content. But we're interessted in the file control.tar.gz, where the post- and pre-scripts are. So, unpack the control file in another folder:\ntar xfs control.tar.gz\n\nNow, what you search is the script called postinst, that is executed after the installation of the package. If that script don't exist, just create it, with rwxr-xr-x permissions (755). Inside that script place your db create command, and let the script end with a exit 0 for a successful installation or exit 1 for a failure.\nWhen you did all your belongings, tar the files back to the control file. Use that command in the folder to create the control.tar.gz file.\ntar -czf control.tar.gz *\n\nNow, recreate the deb-package with those new files, with this command:\nar r package.deb debian-binary control.tar.gz data.tar.gz\n\nThat's it!\n", "Q: ADT plugin Error says Location of the android sdk has not been set up in the preferences I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.\nI've downloaded Eclipse Luna (4.4.1) and installed Android ADT plugin using this link\nhttps://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/\nI'm getting error as 'Location of the android sdk has not been set up in the preferences'\n\nWhere can i find the location of Android SDK path.\nWhen we download the complete ADT bundle, we get two folder as 'eclipse' and 'sdk' but in my system there is no such folder as SDK.\nI do not wish to download the ADT bundle \n\nA: After searching a lot, I created a folder named 'android-sdk'(in my Eclipse directory) and inside that folder i created another as tools\nandroid-sdk\n|-tools\n\nand in Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences \nI entered this folders path in 'SDK Location' text box. \n\n", "Q: Cron emails no longer going to local 'chuck' account \n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 installed as a VM on a machine that sends emails, with attachments, via Perl 5.18.2.

Since its on same machine I should not be breaking the genuine policy but the windows will detect it as different machine. So what is solution?\nI would be using both OS for different softwares so it would make sense if I could use both softwares together at a time.\n\nA: First off, I don't think this is an Ubuntu question but more of a Windows question, but I will give you a quick pointer - It is most certainly possible to do, but it does break the Microsoft terms of service and therefore is illegal. Because you will be dual booting, you will already have a copy of windows installed on the computer, adding a second copy in a VM will count as a second copy.

Your computer is nuking your network by creating too many connections for your router.\nTo properly diagnose you would need to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intercept the outgoing traffic with something like Wireshark.\n\n*Work out the application sending the requests.\n\n\nBut given that you're running two pretty substantial downloading applications, they would be my first obvious suspects. Shut them down and see if things improve.\nIn my limited experience with NZB, it might be that you just need to limit the number of connections they're making.

In the VM Settings, under the System section, activate the Enable EFI checkbox. \n\nBut also make sure your chipset is also set to PIIX3 since ICH9 will not work. It will leave you in a black screen. \n\nWhen EFI is enabled, the boot process might take a little bit longer and the screen might stay black until the Ubuntu logo appears when booting. If you see Booting into secure mode right after starting the VM then you won't have any problems, if not, then wait a bit.\n\n\nNote that I tested this with 32 MB of Video, 64 MB of Video and 128 MB of video. The video has nothing to do with the problem in either 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\nA: I changed the chipset to ICH9, disabled nested paging. That solved it for me.\n\nA: I think is problem with 64 bit versions. At the same virtual machine the 64 bit doesn't work but 32 does. With 128M of video works fine the 64 bit one.\n\nA: Hit Right Ctrl+F1 (you will see the shell) and then Right Ctrl+F7. Depending on the Virtualbox configuration use Left Ctrl+Alt together instead of Right Ctrl.\nYou are good to proceed with the installation.\n\nThis works by forcing the kernel's graphics buffer / X / XRandR to re-detect the monitor and display in the proper resolution.\n\nA: Enable EFI mode.\n\nWhen booting, you may see a few errors. However, these are harmless and do nothing to your system. It will still work.\nWhen using EFI mode, make sure the chipset is set to PIIX3 mode, like in my picture. Having it on ICH9 is not fun. However, PIIX3 is the default, so you shouldn't have to set it.\nApparently Ubuntu and EFI now like each other, so they work together better than alone.\n", "Q: Cannot install skype after upgrading to Ubuntu 14.10 After upgrading to 14.10 Skype was removed from my installed packages.

In this case the operation is a bit involved.\nAll told, you have about 40GB of data on a 750 GB disk. Making disk images of the full thing would be considerable waste of time and space.\nWhat I'd recommend, given that the SSD is a much smaller disk, is copy the content and not the entire disk/partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plan the layout of the new disk according to the disk usage. Example: 100GB for / (includes /home), 5 GB for swap, and the remaining ~150 GB for the NTFS partition.\n\n*Archive the content to an external drive (DVDs too small) with around 40GB of space.\nTo do this, boot to a live USB, connect your external disk and do:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo tar -zcf /media/some-disk/root.tar.gz -C /mnt .\nsudo umount /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nsudo tar -zcf /media/some-disk/E.tar.gz -C /mnt .\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nHere /media/some-disk is where the external disk got mounted. We're creating compressed archives, which might save a bit of space, so you could make do with less than 40GB of free space on the disk.\n\n*Swap your disks, boot again to the live USB, use GParted or Disks or your preferred partition tool to make the corresponding partitions. Lets assume they're numbered the same way. Now we extract the files.\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nsudo tar -zxf /media/some-disk/E.tar.gz -C /mnt\nsudo umount /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo tar -zxf /media/some-disk/root.tar.gz -C /mnt\n\nNote that I haven't unmounted /mnt and that it has the root filesystem mounted on it.\n\n*Now we set it up to boot correctly. This involves updating GRUB and the system's fstab. This is a regularly seen issue on AskUbuntu when the OP resizes their partitions. The steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the UUIDs of the new root and swap partition. Use the blkid or lsblk commands. For example:\n$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"d3504dc2-8f01-48f1-be05-d265110e2e73\" TYPE=\"ext4\n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"1895a8c0-f6ea-48fc-a074-ead385f6c7f3\" TYPE=\"swap \n\n\n*chroot to the installed system:\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /sys /proc; do mount --bind $i /mnt$i; done\nchroot /mnt /bin/bash -l\n\n\n*In the chroot, update the fstab:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nChange the UUIDs of the root and swap partitions:\n# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=d3504dc2-8f01-48f1-be05-d265110e2e73 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=1895a8c0-f6ea-48fc-a074-ead385f6c7f3 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\n\n*Now install and update GRUB:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub\n\n\n*Exit the chroot and reboot:\nexit\nreboot\n\n\n\n*Done.\n\n", "Q: Can not access skype on ubuntu I have installed skype on my laptop (Ubuntu) yesterday...\nIt was working properly... \nToday morning I re-installed Ubuntu completely... \nNow it is creating trouble...\nWhen I am trying to login it is showing can't access skype account\nShould I change some proxy settings in that?\nI have not done anything earlier but it was working properly..\nWhen I tried to run \n  sudo apt-get install skype skype-bin \n\nin terminal it is showing: \nReading package lists...

It appears that unity uses the web's favicon for the launcher icon, which is neat. However, it seems to cache the icon for an unknown (to me) time. \nSlack uses javascript to change its favicon to indicate if you have unread messages. It doesn't seem that Unity gets the memo from the web app, and just keeps the default icon.\nIs there a way to regularly refresh the launcher icon?

My only problem is that if I try to turn my computer on without the hard drive plugged in, it wont boot at all. (I am assuming this is because the boot manager is on the external). How can I have Ubuntu on an external but be able to boot to Windows when my external isn't plugged in?\n\nA: Indeed it seems that your boot records and managers are only on the external drive. Normally they are on the internal drive.\nYou should create a Boot Repair Disk and boot into it. It is a handy disk to have anyway.\nWhile in the BRD system, first use gparted to make sure that your internal drive has an active partition with a boot flag set to it. Then running the Recommended repair option should fix the booting problems on your internal hard drive. Reboot.\nYou should also read this forum post about How to create an external USB bootable Linux hard drive (without dual-boot)\n\nA: One way I know how is to install Grub to just the linux / partition and then add an entry to the Windows bootloader that would start the Grub bootloader and thus boot Ubuntu.\nWhen you install Ubuntu, at the last step there is an advanced option where you get to choose where to install Grub. Just tell it to install to the linux / partition, not the Hdd as a whole.\nNow You need to add an entry in the Windows boot manager for Grub.\nYou will need to download EasyBCD, free for personal non-commercial use:\nhttp://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1\nGrab a downloaded copy of EasyBCD and install it to get started.\nNow run EasyBCD\nGo to the Add Entry --- Select Linux --- Select GRUB2, and press the Add Entry button.\nGo to the BCD Deployment --- Select Install the Windows Vista/7 Bootloader to the MBR,  press Write MBR.\nReboot your PC, and this time you’ll see the Microsoft Boot Manager screen giving you two options: Windows 7 and Ubuntu.\nSource: https://neosmart.net/wiki/easybcd/dual-boot/linux/ubuntu/\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Ubuntu install freezes after grub menu I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.10 (also tried 14.04.1 LTS) on my 2009 Macbook Pro 5,2.

But when I select to either try Ubuntu or install it, I get an error saying i8042: No Controller Found and the process freezes. I have to turn off the machine using the power button. \nI have googled around and it seems that it might be related to the keyboard or trackpad, maybe? \nI have tried using nomodeset boot option from rEFInd and the grub boot command editor, but I still get the same result. I also tried using these boot options: i8042.nopnp noacpi nolapic atkbd.reset. Same result. \nFor what its worth, I have replaced my optical drive with a second hard drive, which is the intended destination for the install. Any help getting started would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks!\nedit: Also, my primary hard drive is an SSD and is running OS X Mavericks with disk encryption. Note that I am not trying to install Ubuntu on this disk but on a second internal HDD. Not sure if the disk encryption matters though.\nUpdate: I have made some progress. By editing the boot options in the grub loader, I have new information.  I removed the quiet and splash parameters and added acpi=off. The process is much more verbose now. Also, it ends up dropping into the Busy Box terminal with a flashing cursor. But I can not type anything, the keyboard is not responsive at all.\nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: For anyone else having this problem, it seems like it might be caused by a display driver issue. This can be fixed by adding the 'nomodeset' parameter in the kernel settings on startup. This instructs the kernel to not load video settings during startup but leave it to the X driver when it loads. This means no beautiful splash screen on startup but it beats a non-functional kernel.\nThe following link might be useful for people who don't know how to add the parameter: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132\nPS This issue might also be fixable by correcting video driver settings once the system is booted up. However, this still requires the above step for an initial boot.\n\nA: I managed to solve my problem by turning off disk encryption on the Mac OS X SSD. The solution was less than ideal, but I now have two hard drives in my Macbook Pro, an SSD with OS X Mavericks and an HDD with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Longman dictionary in Ubuntu 14.04 After installing Longman dictionary I had a permission error, then I changed owner and file permissions.

This makes it very difficult to notice a reminder is happening, especially if my headphones are off so I cant hear its \"beep\". Ive nearly missed 2 meetings due to this recently, and only noticed because my panel indicator changed colors, then I noticed in my unity launcher that Thunderbird had a second window open, so I had to cycle through its windows to get the reminder to pop up. That being said, everything else is working fine with Lightning/reminders - just that the reminder window appears 'hidden' behind a pile of other open application windows.\nI am now using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, though I had this working as expected when I was using 13.04 and 13.10 (I had to fresh install, instead of upgrade, because as usual, Ubiquity installer crashed during the install, destroying my prior system). I post this here, because I recall I had to mess with one of the random obfuscated settings in compiz, dconf, some-tweak-or-another tool, and cant seem to find it now. \nI was searching on duckduckgo/google all morning for this, and I could have sworn this was trivial for me to search and find the last time I solved this.\nHow can I force a Lightning/Thunderbird reminder to always be the topmost window, regardless of the application in which I am focused?\n\nA: with CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager) open General Options > Focus & Raise Behaviour > Focus Prevention Windows\nIf this this is empty, enter: \"!(class=Thunderbird)\" else if non empty, add \"& !(class=Thunderbird)\"\nThis tells Thunderbird to ignore the focus prevention rules, which will cause Thunderbird's reminders to pop up wherever you have focus.\nAlternatively you can just set \"Focus Prevention Level\" to \"Off\" which will allow any new window to steal focus. \n", "Q: Restore Boot Partition from running ubuntu I accidentally wiped the /boot partition of my running Ubuntu 14.04.

Thanks!\n\nA: The trick is to check the folder's content at certain intervals, and compare the list of files with the last check. Since only new files need to be converted, files that were already in the list the last time can be skipped.\nThat is what the script below does. It is in python, but the principle is the same in any language.\nWhat it does:\nWhen the script initiates, it makes a list of files in the directory.\nThen, in a loop, every 5 seconds:\n\n\n*\n\n*it checks for additional files\n\n*if additional files were found, they will be converted, files that were already there are skipped.\n\n*it sets the last checked file list to be the \"new\" initial file list.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndirectory = \"/path/to/your/files\"\n\ndef current_files():\n    read = subprocess.check_output([\"ls\", directory]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    return [item for item in read.split(\"\\n\")]\n\ninitial_files = current_files()\n\nwhile True:\n    update = current_files()\n    for item in update:\n        if (item in initial_files, item.startswith(\"frm\")) == (False, True):\n            subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"dos2unix\", directory+\"/\"+item])\n    initial_files = update\n    time.sleep(5)\n\nCopy the script into an empty file, set the path to your folder, save it as convert.py,  and run the script in the background by the command:\npython3 /path/to/convert.py\n\n\nA: A fragile way using inotifywait and awk:\n#!/bin/bash\nDIR=\"/path/to/folder\"\nwhile FILE=\"$(inotifywait '$DIR'  -e close_write --format '%e,%f' | awk -F, '$NF ~ /^frm/{print $NF}')\"\ndo     \n    echo $FILE; \n    if [[ -f $FILE ]]\n    then\n        dos2unix \"$DIR/$FILE\"\n    fi    \ndone\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to install inotify-tools:\nsudo apt-get install inotify-tools\n\n\n*This watches only the close_write event, so dos2unix would happen after the process that created or modified it closed the file. \n\n*You could also watch the directory recursively using the -r option.\n\n*inotifywait has an --exclude option which accepts POSIX-extended regular expressions, but negating a regex (everything except frm) is complicated, and more easily done in awk.\n\n*This will break if filenames contain a comma ,.

You should see a user/password prompt\n\n*Log into the text console with your user account\n\n*Ensure package list is updated: sudo apt-get update\n\n*I got a message at the end saying configuration of packages was interrupted earlier, instructing me to do the following:sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n*Now to complete, ensure package installation complete (this step might be superfluous): sudo apt-get install -f\n\n*Now remove packages which are no longer required: sudo apt-get autoremove\n\n*Now reboot: sudo reboot\nResult: blue screen gone and can log in again. \n", "Q: Clean install of Ubuntu 14.10 hangs I am trying to do a \"clean\" installation of Ubuntu 14.10 but the process gets part of the way and then hangs.

This is what I have done:\nWhen the installer got to the point where it asks where to install it and gave various options, I chose \"Something else\".\nI then told it to install it on /dev/sda1 (which already has Ubuntu 14.04) and to format the partition with a mount point as /\nI also specified that /dev/sda2 was  to be the /home directory\nThe installation carried on for a while and then hung.\nI have made several attempts with both DVDs but it appears to hang at the same place (formatting the partition before copying the files) each time with either DVD.\nWhat am I doing wrong??\nI am wondering if I should have formatted the partition first, using gparted.\nI used Ubuntu 14.04 to download the .iso file and Brasero to burn it\n\nA: I had similar problem on older notebook, but the installation went to the end and hung. Although if Your case is related I suggest making sure You have enough RAM and define swap space - at the same step as installation target (swap for temporary storage during installation and work of system in the future).\nAlso I would'n concern the installation about sda2 as /home, You can do that afterwards, just don't format or change anything You don't need to.\n\nA: It seems there is any bug with parted or mkfs,\nso what I did is create partition again and using terminal (Ctrl-Alt+F1) did a mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdaX, then rebooted and started installation again without formating any partition and installation succeded.\n\nA: Try creating a new partition table on the drive you want to install Ubuntu on and make a completely new filesystem. I had an issue were it would crash and doing that fixed it for me, just make sure you backup any important data. Also if possible try installing using a USB instead of a DVD.\n", "Q: Can not install packages after upgrade to 14.10 After upgrade to 14.10 from 14.04 (desktop ed) I can't install new packages or update the existing ones.

This means that you cannot login as Root directly or use the su command to become the Root user. However, since the Root account physically exists it is still possible to run programs with root-level privileges. This is where sudo comes in - it allows authorized users (normally \"Administrative\" users) to run certain programs as Root without having to know the root password. \nScraped from Ubuntu Documentation\n\nA: If you want to give others access to the drive, you can use the chmod command along with the -R parameter to invoke the command recursively.

It turns out that the NVIDIA drivers need a custom modprobe rule that is not installed by default with either nvidia-331 or the the opencl drivers. These rules are provided in the nvidia-modprobe package.\nHere is a list of all of the packages you will need to get OpenCL working on Ubuntu 14.10 with NVIDIA drivers:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331 nvidia-331-uvm nvidia-opencl-dev nvidia-modprobe\n\nEDIT: In case anyone encounters a similar problem on Ubuntu 15.04 and the NVIDIA 346.59 drivers, the command to fix the issue is nearly identical:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346 nvidia-346-uvm nvidia-opencl-dev nvidia-modprobe\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 14.04 nvidia-modprobe messed up my system. But I realized that the nvidia-331-uvm is not activated from the start (god knows why). So let's activate it:\n$ sudo modprobe nvidia-331-uvm\n$ sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/nvidia-uvm c 249 0\n\nAnd then:\n$ sudo clinfo\n\nThen you'll be able to use opencl even as a non-root user. Why it's like this is explained in the Virtual Lighttable mailing list.\nThus, I finally added the next lines in my /etc/rc.local file:\n# begin opencl config\nmodprobe nvidia-331-uvm\nmknod -m 666 /dev/nvidia-uvm c 249 0\nclinfo\n# end opencl config \n\nThen everything works smoothly ;)\n", "Q: Load_Cycle_Cont increase quick / green hdd dead an old bug is still there:\nI use a normal hdd, and the Load_Cycle_Count increade very quick.

(14.04) I recently asked this question about adding a shell script to Dash:  \nIn 14.04 how do I run a bash script I wrote without opening a terminal?\nIt worked perfectly.\nFollow-up question:  How can I pass command-line arguments through Dash?  Example:  In this case, my dash command is named \"Panel\".  The script panels my screen with 8 terminals.  Here's an example of the usage:\npanel             # Tile the screen with 8 terminal windows.\npanel --left      # Tile the left side with 4 terminals\npanel --right     # Tile the right side with 4 terminals\n\nAnd so on.  How can I pass arguments like --left or --right through Dash?  Ideally I'd like to have this workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the SUPER key\n\n*Type panel --left (for example)\n\n*Dash goes away and the left side is paneled.\n\n\nRight now it runs the right script, but ignores --left. \nTips?\n\nA: The problem is that you cannot \"run\" a .desktop file from Dash with arguments, so the setup exactly like you have in mind is impossible I am afraid. However, assuming your script does take arguments, there are a few elegant alternative options, maybe even better:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your script in ~/bin\n\n\n*\n\n*remove the extension\n\n*make it executable\n\n*run it by pressing AltF2, type the command\n<scriptname> <argument> \n\n\n\n\n*Create a quicklist in the Unity launcher:\n(assuming you saved the script in ~/bin, made it executable and removed the extension as in 1.)\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=name_of_your_script_like_you_see_it_in_Dash\nExec=<scriptname> <default_argument>\nIcon=/path/to/some/icon\nType=Application\n\nActions=Panel;Panel -left;Panel -right;\n\n[Desktop Action Panel]\nName=Panel\nExec=<scriptname> <default_argument>\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n[Desktop Action Panel -left]\nName=Panel -left\nExec=<scriptname> <argument_1>\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n[Desktop Action Panel -left]\nName=Panel -right\nExec=<scriptname> <argument_2>\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nSave it as panel.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications and drag it on to the launcher.\n\n\n\n*Create three different keyboard shortcuts, for example Alt+<, Alt+^, Alt+> to run your script+arguments:\n\"System Settings\" > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\"\nClick \"+\" to add your commands: <scriptname> <argument>\n\n\n\n*Not the most obvious one, but exploring the options, it should be mentioned: you can call a (zenity) option list from Dash:\n\nType the first character of your option, press return and your script will run with the chosen argument.\n\nAgain assuming that you saved the script in ~/bin, made it executable and removed the language extension as in 1.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as panel_options.sh, make it executable.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntest=$(zenity --list \"1. Panel\" \"2. Panel -left\" \"3. Panel -right\" --column=\"Panel options\" --title=\"Panel\")\n\nif [[ \"$test\" = \"1. Panel\"* ]]; then\n    <scriptname> <default_argument>\nelif [[ \"$test\" = \"2. Panel -left\"* ]]; then\n    <scriptname> <argument_1>\nelif [[ \"$test\" = \"3. Panel -right\"* ]]; then\n    <scriptname> <argument_2>\nfi\n\n\n*Create the .desktop file from the code below. In the Icon= line, set the path to your icon, in the Exec= line the path to pane_options.sh, save it as panel.desktop in ~/.local/share/applicatios\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Panel\nExec=/path/to/panel_options.sh\nIcon=/path/to/some/icon\nType=Application\nStartupWMClass=Zenity\n\n\nA: From your original question, it looks like the right thing to do would be to move the script to ~/bin/, which should be in your $PATH by default.\nIf you do this, you'll be able to run your script using AltF2 again. You will also be able to pass arguments to it like you do in a shell.\nYou can also add any other folder where you keep your scripts to your $PATH. To do this, open ~/.profile in the text editor of your choice:\n# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login\n# exists.\n# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.\n# the files are located in the bash-doc package.\n\n# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask\n# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.\n#umask 022\n\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nAt the end, add a line (replacing <folder> with your folder) and save the file:\nPATH=\"<folder>:$PATH\"\n\nFor example, I add $HOME/.bin to my $PATH so my binaries don't clutter my home folder, but you could add any directory to your path just be sure to not add anything dangerous (e.g. world-writeable).\nThe changes will take effect on the next login.\n", "Q: Torrent client that saves files to torrent location I currently use Flexget to download torrent files from an rss feed. Flexget automatically saves each torrent in its subfolder, according to a set of rules and names it accordingly. \nNow, what I want is have a torrent client where I can set it up so that when I doubleclick on a torrent, it removes the torrent and simply downloads the linked file to the location of the torrent file. \nOn a Mac I could do this with Transmission but most of the torrent clients in Linux that I've tested so far resort to a \"general download folder\" which is more than useless to me as it messes up my carefully constructed path and makes me do the \"hard chore\" of moving each file to its original location after download.\nI've looked into Transmission json file and couldn't find this option, so does anybody knows how can I set it up on Transmission or any other client that does this \"trick\" of downloading to where the original torrent file was?\n\nA: you can use deluge for that purpose\nsudo apt-get install deluge\n\nit should work like charm (i call it as utorrent of linux, they are very similar)\n", "Q: Update GCC compiler in Ubuntu 14.04 to 4.9 Can I upgrade my GCC compiler now in Ubuntu 14.04?

To use the older ACPI method, you need to edit the grub file and reboot:\nOpen a terminal alt+ctrl+t and enter the folowing lines:\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.backup\n\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nIn the Nano editor, look for the line beginning with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT   At the end of the line add intel_pstate=disable The whole line shoud now look like this\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_pstate=disable\"\n\npress the keys ctrl+o to write the file, and ctrl+x to exit Nano.  Then in the terminal, enter the following command to update Grub\nsudo update-grub\nYou should now reboot your computer, and find that you are able to set the governors as you did in 14.04\n", "Q: Help decoding Base64 using base64 -d **** This post links to Windows-Based malware executables!!!

My Elantech experience is limited.  I'm quite sure this is a kernel regression.  There were other kernel issues with the Yoga 2 Pro as well (notably WiFi) but they were fixed with the 14.10 distribution.\nelantech touchpad - multi touch is not working for kernel 3.13.0-35-generic \nThis thread points you to the bug report which likely is where your problem lies.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1166442/+index?comments=all \nFirst, try going to your terminal and type synclient and see if it returns your trackpad configuration.  If so, what does VertTwoFingerScroll show?  If it shows VertTwoFingerScroll=0 then run:\n\nsynclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\n\nSee if it starts working.  It's my understanding that xinput is obsolete.\nIf this makes it work then you need to study 50-synaptics.conf because this is the config file that makes the synclient settings on boot.  This I understand rather well because I needed to do lots of synaptics modifications on the Yoga Pro 2 to make it useable.  The trackpad kernel problem on 14.10 for the Yoga 2 Pro is that PalmDetect does not work.  It can be fixed by a kernel patch.  I should be able to help you get the configuration file working.  It's pretty cryptic.\nYou kind of need to know how to work with synclient and 50-synaptics.conf if you want to get the most out of your trackpad and fine tune settings.\nIf it doesn't work, I believe is a deep dark kernel problem with the Elantech hardware and it does not recognize it.  From what the link above alluded to, try installing an older version of Ubuntu and see if the trackpad works.  I think this would prove the kernel regression theory.  \nYou could try the kernel patch in the above link on 14.10.  You have been messing with a lot of configuration so if you are going to go through the trouble of a kernel patch I would do a fresh install of 14.10.  Study the bug report in detail because I think the kernel patch came from the bug report originally.  There are very recent posts in the bug report and successful patch implementations.\n\nA: Try the following as mentioned in this thread:\nOpen your /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf and comment out this paragraph with #s:\n#Section \"InputClass\"\n#        Identifier \"evdev touchpad catchall\"\n#        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n#        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n#        Driver \"evdev\"\n#EndSection\n\nNow create a file called /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.confwith the following content in it: \nSection \"Module\"\n    Load    \"synaptics\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n        Driver \"synaptics\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n        Option \"TapButton2\" \"2\"\n        Option \"TapButton3\" \"3\"\n    Option \"VertEdgeScroll\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\nNow log out, and log in again. Restart if you dont mind. Then you can try running these commands: \nsynclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\nsynclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=0 #or 1 if you need it\nsynclient EmulateTwoFingerMinY=5\nsynclient EmulateTwoFingerMinZ=48\n\nAnd check if two finger scroll works. \nIf it does, you have to find a way of running the above lines every time you log into the GUI.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 no caching page found on all hard drives Ubuntu 14.10 no caching page found on all hard drives 2 sata and two ide  also same if I mount avusb drive\nAfter upgraded from 14.04.1 and also from a clean install of 14.10\nDuring boot I get error on all hard drives no caching page found.

All that this indicates is that your drive's SCSI mode pages don't contain an entry for caching. A mode page allows reading metadata related to the device, and changing the settings of the device, for example, to disable or enable write caching.\nIn this case, your device does not provide information about any underlying write caching mechanism. This could be for a variety of reasons, most likely that either the device may be passed through an interface which presents itself as a SCSI device, but does not expose any cache (for example, if you were exposing the drive using a USB enclosure), or the device may simply have no cache (although this seems to not be true for your particular device).\n\nSource\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 create new user password change button disabled I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.10 (AMD64) to my desktop this evening.

I'm not entirely sure why the Linux community refers to all 64-bits as \"amd64\" exactly. However, rest assured that the \"amd64\" variant simply means \"64-bit\" and will work on any 64-bit AMD or Intel processor (internally, they're pretty much the exact same thing).\nA2: Yes, you can create an EFI partition from Windows 7.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type 'diskpart' into the start menu search and press enter\n\n*Use the following sequence of command to set up your EFI disk:\nlist (take note of the disk you want to use. mine was the second disk, #1 in my VM)\nselect disk [disk number]\nlist partition (just to make sure you have the right disk selected, it should show no partitions)\nconvert gpt\nselect partition 1\ndelete partition override\ncreate partition efi size=100\n\nNow you should be all ready for an Ubuntu install! Just use the \"Use entire disk\" option when the installer asks and you should be done.\n\nA: It's not just the Linux community that refers to  amd64.

I have no broken packages and I have unchecked all my non-official software sources in the 'Software & Updates' manager.\nMy guess left is the Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu. If anyone could give any help as to how to check for unofficial packages using Synaptic or another, my appreciation.\nAre there any other factors that may be causing this error and how would I go about checking/fixing those?\nThanks.\nEdit: I have no broken or held packages. Everything is up-to-date, and restarting everything or anything has no effect.\n\nA: Try executing:\ngrep ERROR /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log\n\nHopefully this will show you the names of conflicting packages. For me it was (I broken long line to be easier to read):\n2014-10-25 18:15:05,915 ERROR Dist-upgrade failed: \n    'The package 'postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.1' \n    is marked for removal but it is in the removal blacklist.\n\npostgresql-9.3-postgis-2.1 is conflicting package here. It will probably be different one or some for you. You can then remove it/them by:\nsudo apt-get remove conflicting-package-1 conflicting-package-2 ...\n\nThen just restart distribution upgrade.\n\nA: I managed to solve it by switching to main server in the ubuntu upgrade dialog box. Previously it was pointing to US\n\nA: I found that \"broken\" packages were causing problems with the upgrade.  My packages (gnuplot) weren't explicitly broken (checked by looking in Synaptic package manager), but were marked to not be upgraded.  This type of package will also cause the upgrade to crash; they can be found in the Synaptic package manager by filtering for \"Installed (upgradeable)\".  I simply marked them for deletion, then ran\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\n... so far so good!\n\nA: So I managed to solve the issue, but I am unaware as to how I did so. If you have any idea, I'd still like to know what it is I did that caused the resolution.\nHere's exactly what I did.\nI ran dist-upgrade and apt-get update/upgrade like a madman, continuously checking my broken and held packages in synaptic, of which I never had any. I had a few leftover packages like ROS libraries which I removed because I didn't want them anyways.\nAfter a two days of waiting, I decided to look at the question referenced to by https://askubuntu.com/users/342922/user342922 . I peered into /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log and after seeing some reference to the ROS Libs I removed, I deleted that log file.\nOnly after I deleted that log file did dist-upgrade ever work. Any Ideas as to why this may have occurred? If prompted I'll move this to a new question, but it's not a pressing matter, just interested.\nMy odd solution: delete the apt.log file for dist-upgrade.\n\nA: I had the same issue, though none of the logs listed anything about broken pages (nor did any output from apt-get).\nThe solution was to change the mirror that I was downloading my updates from.  I typically use a local mirror here in Australia for speed, but it almost-always causes issues during upgrades due to either outdated packages or missing content.  \nMy computer was apparently fully up-to-date, but after I switched my mirror to the Main server and ran:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nseveral new packages got updated.  After running update-manager, my Ubuntu 14.04 is was able to correctly upgrade.\n\nA: After fiddling a while with the different suggestions, what worked for me was commenting the multiverse entries in /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\nA: Try remove xserver-xorg-video-all.\n", "Q: ubuntu server: wifi I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 server on my computer that has both a wired network port and a wifi card.

The test was done on 1 GB old Macbook, and 64-bit OS has showed better performance. So, when you want to upgrade to new Ubuntu release, consider switching to 64 bit version. It's not that you have to use 32 bit OS with less than 4 GB or RAM,  but rather that 32-bit OS can't use anything above 4 GB, and 64-bit OS just differ in that - they can use more memory.\nOccasionally, try looking into logs, see if there's any errors or crashes to troubleshoot problems. Generally you can look through /var/log directory, or through system log utility ( I personally have Ubuntu's default system log utility and installed KSystemLog , which i think is from for kde desktop ).

It's normal when using terminals that pressing up and down cycles through previous commands entered chronologically.\nI learned from a site how to add to that behaviour by autocompleting what I'm typing at the cursor based on previously entered commands when pressing up and down.\nFor example, let's say I typed the following commands in this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls Videos\n\n*ls Vids\n\n*lsomething\n\n*ls Videos/Funny/Old\n\n*vi file\n\n*ls Music\nIf I haven't typed anything, pressing up and down will cycle through all of the lines just like normal. But, if I've typed ls, pressing up and down cycles through all commands where the first 2 characters are ls (lines 1,2,3,4,6 above). Entering ls (with a space after) though, will only let up and down cycle through lines 1,2,4,6. Similarly, ls Vid lets the arrows cycle through lines 1,2,4 but ls Videos just allows cycling between lines 1 and 4.\nIt's pretty useful to complete values specific to commands that you need to enter over and over again without having to cycle through every single unrelated command you've entered between them. For example, I'm trying to test the effects of env values, like locale, on things:\nenv [many different values] [command]\n[insert many different commands here]\nenv [slightly different values from before] [command]\n[doing other stuff]\n\nI'd only have to press up a few times after typing env to cycle between the values I've tried.\nI apologize if it's a bit of a long way to describe it. I don't know what it's called. My terminals used to have this behaviour, but they seem to have lost it and I can't find the site I learned it from. I think it has something to do with editing ~/.bashrc.\n\nA: To get the behavior you are after, add these lines to your ~/.inputrc (create the file if it does not exist):\n\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward\n\nThen, open a new terminal and it will work as expected. This behavior is controlled by the settings in /etc/inputrc and ~/.inputrc. You can read more about them in the Readline Command Names section of man bash:\n   non-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)\n          Search forward  through  the  history  using  a  non-incremental\n          search for a string supplied by the user.\n   history-search-forward\n          Search  forward through the history for the string of characters\n          between the start of the current line and the point.

After you reinstall Grub, you'll have the choice of booting into Windows 7 or Linux.\nThere are a number of ways to Install Grub.\nYou can use this method to install Grub on your boot harddrive.  This will replace the Windows boot manager:\nBoot to a live Ubuntu DVD and use the Try Ubuntu option.

Yes, I know that I can make a file non executable by setting appropriate permission bits on that file.

The specific extension which I have in my mind is .txt. \nIn summary, How to instruct Ubuntu not to execute any files with .txt extension? \nNote: There is a similar feature in Windows 7 as far as I know. \n\nA: No file has executable permissions when created unless you changed the default umask settings yourself. You always need to set executable permissions yourself. \n\nWhat I want to do is, making all the files with a certain extension non-executable, So that Nautilus will prompt. \n\nNautilus has some options though (in preferences, behaviour, middle set of options):\n\nWhat this does is check the file you click and check what the file is (by checking the shebang line or the 1st byte of the file) to see if it is an executable and offer to either execute, view or ask what to do with the file you clicked. Text files that have contain text (and not a shebang and/or code) will always open instead of getting executed.\nMind you: this is NOT based on extensions. Extensions are (/should be!) visual aids for us humans; not a way for programs to identify files (an MP3 named music.txt is still an MP3 and not a text file). \n\nA: Ubuntu offers to execute file only if it has execute permissions. So remove execute permission from all .txt files and you're all set.\nfind /home/yourname -type f -iname \"*.txt\" -exec chmod -x {} \\;\nMaybe also do the right click 'open with' and change default program to your editor.\n", "Q: How to launch GUI app (in Ctrl+Alt+F7) from tty (Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6) I want to know that how can I launch GUI apps from tty (Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6) into GUI mode (Ctrl+Alt+F7)\nSometimes, users having problem with GUI mode like: can login to GUI but Launcher is not working or unable to open even terminal from shortcut.

Google \"How to partition my hard drive on windows 10\". This way when the Ubuntu install starts, it knows that your hard drive has free space to be able to install it \"on the side\". This might help that option show up in the Ubuntu installer window. When this happened to me, it was because it just wanted to install over windows because it didn't know it had free space and when I tried partitioning through Ubuntu it also just wanted to format everything first.\n\nA: What I did was take an already installed Ubuntu 14 environment and zero out a spare drive with dc3dd as sudo dc3dd wipe=/dev/sdX (where sdX= the drive I wanted to blank, in my case it was sdc). I disconnected the drives I didn't want Windows to see (call me paranoid). Then I booted up the Windows 10 Technical preview and installed it onto the spare drive. After insuring that Win10 was functioning to the best of it's ability, I shut down, reconnected my Ubuntu 14 drive and my home drive (I keep home on a separate drive, not necessary but a preference).

As explained at the thread Ubuntu on Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro I wanted to edit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf and also to create a script in /usr/local/bin/ but neither I can edit the first file nor create the second. While trying to edit and after that saving the file I got a notification that I don't have the necessary rights (although I'm admin).\nSorry, this is maybe a simple problem, but I just started to get known to Ubuntu and also searched on the forum, but couldn't find anything.\n\nA: Stuff in /usr/local/bin can only be edited by admin users. That's why users can add their own files to /home/user/bin, and add this to their path. (That's what I do.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Do this: sudo nedit /usr/local/bin/myfile\n\n*Type in your password. \n\n*You now have admin privileges to edit this one file. That does not mean all your users will have permissions to run it or edit it. This file will have admin permissions by default, because 'sudo' makes you a temporary admin. \n\n*Edit and save the file. \n\n*Now you have to change the permissions of the file so normal users can run it. Do: sudo chmod g+rw /usr/local/bin/myfile. This changes group permissions. Make sure the users who have to run this are part of the group, whatever that may be.\n\n*If you are still having problems, give everyone permissions for this file only: sudo chmod a+rwx /usr/local/bin/myfile. \n\n*You will also have to add this dir to the user's path if it is not already. \n\n\nIf you get an error message that you can't use sudo, edit /etc/sudoers I think, and add your username there, one user per line. \nUse whatever editor you like, even 'nano', 'vi', instead of 'nedit'. \nWhen doing stuff with files in these \"global\" directories, remember to use sudo before each command.

Only running apps are: Chrome, Banshee and thunderbird. It might have something to do with flash, but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nA: It looks like your physical RAM is getting full and the system starts to use the Swap. Programmes like Chromium can easily take up several Gb of RAM. On 12.04, with about 20 tabs open Chromium would get up to 2 Gb of RAM in less than a day.\nYou can start by monitoring closely your free RAM with the System Monitor. See if these episodes of high disk usage coincide with a full (or near full) RAM. If that is the case then try to understand if any programme stands out; both Chromium and Thunderbird could be the culprits.\nIn any case, if you are used to have multiple tabs open in your web browser, I would definitely advise you to use Firefox instead.\n\nA: Have you tried limiting your open tabs to 4-5? \nWhile browsing with different number of tabs open, type free -m at a command line to see how much memory you have list.

Touchpad has always worked perfectly for more than a year now, first with Ubuntu 12 and now with Ubuntu 14.04 after the upgrade.\nToday the touchpad stopped working suddenly after logging in. It is not responding at all.\nThe wireless mouse is working fine.\nI also noticed a weird notification popping up at some stage saying wireless keyboard battery was low or something like that. However I am not using a wireless keyboard as it is a laptop and I am not using the battery as it is plugged in.\nAny clue how I can restore my touchpad functionalities?\n\nA: Did you ever figure this out? The first thing I would check is if there is a button on the laptop that disables the touchpad. That's happened to me a few times before.\n", "Q: Several crashes after upgrading to 14.10 from 14.04 I upgraded my system today from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10. There were issues because I was using Gnome 3.12 from \"ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging\". I was able to fix the issues (unmet dependencies, broken packages). However, there are now several applications that crash regularly. My assumption is that this is because of the issues I had with Gnome after upgrading. Crashes only happen if specific operations are performed.\nApplications that now regularly crash:\n\n\n*\n\n*nautilus (e.g. when I right click on a file and choose \"Open With ->\nOther Application\" or when I switch window from nautilus to something\nelse with Alt+Tab)\n\n*gnome-tweak-tool (e.g. when I try to change Window theme or to remove an extension)\n\n*background (when I click on the \"Background\" or \"Lock Screen\" image)\n\n\nWhat I already tried (always with the same result as before):\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Gnome 3.14 using these instructions\n\n*Reinstalled applications\n\n\nI appreciate any tips on what else I could try out.\n\nA: So I resolved the issue now, but I did not found a simple solution. I basically did a fresh install of gnome:\n\n\n*\n\n*Used synaptic to remove anything related to gnome, ubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-session (mark for complete removal)\n\n*Ran \"sudo apt-get -f install\" to resolve unmet dependencies\n\n*Ran \"sudo apt-get install gnome-shell\" to reinstall gnome\n\n\nThis did the trick for me.\n\nA: just do a ppa purge everything will be F9\nRun \nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nit will revert your system back to official versions of all gtk things that come by defAult\ni hv dOnE it mAH selF ...||\n", "Q: compizconfig-settings-manager: command not found When I start compizconfig-settings-manager, I get the message command not found, but apt-get says that it is installed.\nSearching for the reason, I found that compizconfig-settings-manager was updated in the last system update, the log says \"compizconfig-settings-manager:amd64 (0.9.5.92-0ubuntu3, 0.9.8+bzr3287-0linaro3)\". There (and also in many other entries) appears this linaro, which seems to be the problem. Because few days ago, I added a repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linaro-maintainers/overlay\n\nNow I wanted to remove it with\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:linaro-maintainers/overlay\n\nBut it failed with the message (no module named Linaro). I found another way to remove this repository: I deleted the file for this repository in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\nI thought now I could just make a system update to get back the old packages, but the update manager says that all my packages are the newest version. So how can I get rid of those linaro-packages?\n\nA: Two commands - one to add the PPA - the other to revert back to official packages and to remove it again:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linaro-maintainers/overlay\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:linaro-maintainers/overlay\n\n", "Q: System completely unusable after upgrading to 14.10 I can't use my PC anymore after upgrading from 14.04 to 14.10. The download and upgrade process was good but now when I turn the PC on, I get a black screen with error:\n\nsystem program problem detected\n\nAnd two options: Cancel and Report problem. \nI can only use the mouse but the desktop is black and there are no icons. I can't activate Terminal. I read various posts on the web and followed different guides, but haven't solved the problem.\nI can't even install a new version of Ubuntu starting from a bootable USB. When the system starts instead of booting the live version of Ubuntu, I get the GRUB menu ( ! ) ( I've never used Grub on my system ). When I select Ubuntu, the start-up process starts, but I get the error:\n\n4.129466 i8042: no controller found\n\nWhat is my problem? And how do I fix it?\n\nA: Do you have an AMD graphics card? If so, were you using the fglrx drivers? There has been an issue with them lately on this new update, as some packages needed for the driver to work correctly weren't updated to Utopic. In this case, open up tty1 (Terminal 1) by hitting the keys Ctrl + Alt + F1, log in with an account that has sudo privileges and run:\nsudo apt-get remove fglrx-*\n\nThis should solve the black screen problem.\n\nA: Hi I followed this advice, got back graphical access, but error message indicated underlying conflicts. So then reinstalled xorg elements using Synaptic packager, now can use while waiting for update repairing fglrx install.  Thanks, bob\n\nA: If your problem is still not solved after more conventional suggestions from others, please try the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove your hard drive and attach it to an external USB drive adapter case appropriate to its size and interface, ie SATA, or mSATA, etc.\n\n*Attach it to another computer and try to instruct that computer to boot to your drive as though it were (and it is) an external usb drive.\n\n*See if it boots correctly.  If it does, it suggests that something related to your graphics card of your current PC is not entirely compliant with the drivers which were installed in the upgrade.  Fortunately, you will have access to drive to undriver it either using apt commands or my preference, the Synaptic Package Manager.\n\n", "Q: Changing default make command I'm taking the course of HarvardX: CS50x Introduction to Computer Science. Normally for doing this course you have to use a virtual machine for running a Fedora system called the cs50 appliance, with all the things made easy, but I already use Kubuntu so I downloaded clang and the cs50 library and I want to change the default options of make to include the library and stop when there are errors in the c program that I try to compile. In the appliance the make command does: clang -ggdb3 -00 -std=c99 -Wall -Werror  -argv-2.c -lcs50 -lm -o argv-2. It would be nice if you can explain what should be included and why. When I compile a .c file using make, it doesn't load the cs50 library and I get: undefined function ...\nI tried writing $ nano ~/.bashrc. Then went to the end of the file and put\n #CS50 alias for C compiling:\n alias makec='gcc -ggdb3 -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -argv-2.c -lcs50 -lm -o -argv-2'\n\nThen $ source .bashrc\nWhen I do $ makec hello now it says:\ngcc: error: hello: No such file or directory\ngcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-argv-2.c’\n\n\nA: What you need to do is related to the programs gcc and ld.\nEnvironment variables C_INCLUDE_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are places to search for headers and libraries respectively. The gcc options -l and -L are of use, it's usual to declare something like\nLIBRARIES= -lcs\nLIBDIR=-L/usr/local/lib\nThen use these make-variables in the commands run by each rule. \nIf you installed these libraries using apt-get there may be package config data available see command pkg-config \n\nA: I do not think this is solving your problem, but to answer the question as stated: \nThere are some ways to set default options for make:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a shell alias, like\nalias make='make --foo=bar'\n\nin ~/.bashrc or similar.\n\n*Setting the environment variable MAKEFLAGS to contain default options.\n\n*Using the environment variable MAKEFLAGS to add the default option -e (--environment-overrides), and define other variables relevant to the makefiles in ~/.bashrc, to be picked up by make, prioritized over definitions in the Makefile\nWith each of this methods, all uses of make are affected, which is not really what you want here.\nA better solution seems to be to not change the default options of make,\nbut to use a separate alias to run make interactively. The alias can set options for recursive invocations of make.\nalias cs50make='make --foo=bar'\n\nor \nalias cs50make='MAKEFLAGS=\"...\" make'\n\nor even\nalias cs50make='MAKEFLAGS=\"-e ...\" VAR1=\"...\" VAR2=\"...\" make'\n\n\nRegarding making make stop on errors: It should normally do that by default, but if it's somewhere set to not stop, you can use the option -S (--no-keep-going, --stop) to override.\n\nA: export CC=gcc\nexport CFLAGS=\"-ggdb3 -O0 -std=c99 -Wall -Werror\"\nexport LDLIBS=\"-lcs50 -lm\"\n\n-ggdb\n       Produce debugging information for use by GDB.

I have searched the web and i also went through the preferences, but cannot find the solution to the problem.\nlibvte-2.90-9 is already installed\n\nA: Ok. I have found the answer by installing an older version of libvte. That is most likely due to Geany still using GTK2 rather than GTK3.

Below is my .s file.\nI first type as -gstabs -o ex71.o ex71.s into terminal which is what my textbook does [to create an object file right?].  Then I type the gcc -o ex71 ex71.s command.

I recommend doing a clean install but make sure you backup any important data as it will be deleted if you do decide to go with a clean install. Also Ubuntu 14.10 came out yesterday so you may want to consider jumping straight to it, so far it's been rock solid.\nUpgrade from a previous version of Ubuntu\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade\nUsing a USB or CD/DVD\nDVD: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-ubuntu\nUSB: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\n", "Q: Gedit .LOG feature In MS Notepad I can create a file like this:\n.LOG\n\nI updated function xyz(), line 32 today.\n\nsave it, and when I open it:\n.LOG\n\nI updated function xyz(), line 32 today.\n\n25-10-14 8:04:56\n\nHow can I achive the same functionality in gedit, or a similar program for Ubuntu?\n\nA: I am not sure of the exact behaviour of Notepad here. While I don't know how to make vim do that based on some existing text in a file, I could make vim do something similar for files of a certain extension, by adding this to ~/.vimrc:\nau BufWritePre *.log :normal G\"=strftime(\"\\n%b %d, %Y %X\\n\")^Mp\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*au - stands for AutoCommand, the vim way of executing some action for some event.\n\n*BufWritePre - the vim event for just before writing out a file.\n\n**.log - the files to do this for (you could pick another extension)\n\n*:normal  - Go to normal mode (the mode you're usually in when you start vim)\n\n*G - go to the last line\n\n*\"=strftime(\"\\n%b %d, %Y %X\\n\")^M - Into the default buffer (\"), copy the output of the strftime function (the ^M is a literal newline, obtained by pressing CtrlV, then Enter)\n\n*p - then paste the buffer.\n\n\nEach time I write the file using :w, the current date will be appended to the file:\n$ vim test.log\n$ vim test.log\n$ cat test.log \nI did some work.\n\nOct 26, 2014 01:15:55  IST\n\nDidn't I?\n\nOct 26, 2014 01:16:02  IST\n\nThis is quite customizable. You can pick your file extension, leave out the G if you want to append the date after the current line, modify the time format, use other events (see :h autocmd-events).\n\nA: I have used the \".LOG\" functionality of Notepad for several years and have grown to depend on it quite a bit. My answer to you is not as sophisticated as some of the replies here (I suspect that is because I am not as savvy as some of the people who have attempted to help you herein...) When the Microsoft XP OS was abandoned by Microsoft I chose to make a leap-of-faith by porting my old XP machine to Debian Linux. (Couldn't love a human baby as much as I love Debian Linux BTW... ;o)! ) In any case, having the same dilemma as yourself I simply installed WINE and used Notepad from within it. I hope this helps you.\n", "Q: Which version for old Asus EEE I have an old Asus EEE 1000H with Windows which I don't use (having a newer PC). But I thought it would be interesting to replace the Windows with Ubuntu on the EEE to give me some experience of Linux.\nShould I download the latest version or go for an older one?\n\nA: You shouldn't have any trouble with the latest release of Ubuntu (14.04.1 LTS) on your netbook, but I would recommend picking the 32-bit variant if you have less than 2 GB of RAM. Unlike Windows, Ubuntu's system requirements do not generally increase as newer versions are released. One thing to watch out for is graphics support, as versions of Ubuntu after 12.04 removed support for 2D graphics, but I have only had trouble with this on Pentium 4-era desktop computers. \nFrom the general specifications of your computer that I found online (Intel Atom, 1 GB of RAM, etc.) don't expect a lighting-quick experience, but it should be plenty usable. I have had Ubuntu 12.04 running on an HP netbook of similar specs and was able to play YouTube videos at acceptable quality.\nOfficial Ubuntu system requirements are here, and you can get Ubuntu here.\nYou can also try a more lightweight distro like Lubuntu, Xubuntu, or Kubuntu if Ubuntu proves too graphically demanding.\n", "Q: Swap Space Allocation Problem I have a single 160 GB physical hard drive. I have Windows 8.1 installed on 100 GB (Local Disk C:). I left the remaining 60 GB as unallocated space for Ubuntu installation.\nNow, the problem is that when I have to assign Root, Home, Swap space on that unallocated 60 GB, I can only assign Root and Home. The remaining 20 GB is shown as unknown space. \nIt says there can only be maximum of 4 partitions on a single drive and I have used all of them (Windows has apparently used up 2 partitions).\nSo, what should I do? Should I forgo the Swap space or is there any other way to get around this problem?\nPlease explain in layman terms if you can.\nP.S : I don't want to remove Windows 8.1 from my computer but I want to dual-boot Ubuntu alongside Windows.\n\nA: There can be only 4 primary partitions, but there can be many more logical partitions. \n\nA: One of those max. 4 primary partitions can be an extended partition which in turn can hold up to 16 logical partitions. So in total you can create up to 19 usable partitions on a drive with an MBR partition table.\nIf you choose “something else“ as installation type, the partition manager of the Ubuntu installer lets you choose between creating primary or logical partitions:\n\nThe partition manager will automatically create an extended partition if necessary to accommodate a newly created logical partition. It hides the complexity of dealing with this technical detail.\nYou should not forgo swap space:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your computer runs out of physical main memory and has no swap space to fall back on, it will\n\n\n*\n\n*start to kill user space processes¹ (and it's hard to predict which ones) to accommodate memory needs of the kernel and\n\n*behave erratically, because memory allocation for user space processes¹ will fail, which most applications aren't programmed to anticipate; this usually leads to crashes because these applications then try to access invalid memory addresses.\n\n\n*While it's possible to have a swap file inside a file system, suspension to a swap file isn't implemented in the kernel. You pretty much need a swap partition for that.\n\n*As I described above it's easy enough to create a swap partition if you can have up to 19 partitions on one drive – a big deal easier than dealing with the aforementioned two problems.\nSee also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/Partitions\n¹ A “user space process“ is what a layman may call an “application”, but the former also encompass other things like server applications and system services.\n", "Q: Firefox does not allow selection of URL bar autocomplete with mouse anymore Firefox normally shows autocompletion entries in the address bar when you start typing a URL (say,  gi). Until recently, I was able to select the appropriate entry (e.g. github.com) with my touchpad/mouse, and it would navigate there. However, I recently set up a new laptop (same OS, Ubuntu 14.04, Firefox 33), migrating my firefox profile over, and now it does not do that anymore, and instead searches for the truncated URL (in the above case gi) via google!\nSelecting an autocomplete entry with cursor keys and enter works as expected.\nIs this a new bug in Firefox, or is this some setting I have to adjust? How can I get the old behaviour back?\n\nA: Turns out this was caused by an old/deprecated extension, Delicious Bookmarks, which apparently was left over in the profile folder I migrated. Disabled that, now everything works again. :-)\n", "Q: When I play a video full screen after about ten minutes the screen goes black, and the sound repeats a loop I'm running Ubuntu 12.04. I had to reinstall the OS on this computer. I didn't have this problem before. This happens in VLC, and youtube. If I'll play a video in full screen, the screen will go black after about ten minutes, and the sound will kind of repeat over, and over where it went black. The only way to fix it is to restart the computer. I can't even get my screen to go back on after that happens. \nNow it's not only when it's full screen. When I watch youtube videos at their regular size my screen will go black after a while, and I have to restart it.\n\nA: Have you guys checked the power settings on your systems? I believe the default is to put the display to \"sleep mode\" after 10 minutes, and then the setting are defaulted to lock the system when the screen does go to sleep.\nGo to your system settings and check those, if they are set to put the screen to sleep, change the setting to a longer time, usually 2 hours is sufficient, and uncheck the box that says \"Lock screen when going to sleep\" hopefully that will solve your problem.\n", "Q: Could this be a hardware issue? I am new with Ubuntu it seems to me like a great option to get over Windows. I have never used it though so I am completely lost. I had Windows 7 64 bit installed on my desktop, (It has a AMD Phoenom II X4 945, ASUS M4A89GTD PRO (No USB 3.0), 4 gb ram DDR3, 500 HDD). A disk with Ubuntu 12.something was given to me to install it and I did but then I was told to upgrade to 14.04 the latest version and the system did not recognize my password. Then we tried with a disc 14.01 but it just do not work. Then I put a new hdd in but now even though when it accepts the hdd I have the following error:\n\"Reboot and select proper Boot device or insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key\"  \nThen if a press a key I have the same error again. The boot order that I have is:\nCD\nHDD\nUSB\nI hope you can help me folks, Thank you\n\nA: It sounds like your Ubuntu boot media is not set up correctly, and even though your computer is trying to boot from the disc it can't. If you have a Windows computer on hand, I would grab a fresh copy of the Ubuntu 14.04.1 Desktop .iso from the website and then install Linux Live USB Creator to create a bootable Ubuntu thumb drive. Alternatively, you can just burn the new .iso file to a DVD, but I like Linux Live USB Creator because it verifies the integrity of the disc image for you. If you do choose to burn the new disc image to a DVD, make sure you check the hash and compare it to the list here.\nAnother minor note would be to grab the 64-bit .iso because your computer is capable of running it.\n", "Q: Force ssh user to different shell through config Is it possible in the openssh-server config, to force a subset of users to use a different shell than the one defined for them in /etc/passwd?\nSay that i, for example, want to confine all users logging on from outside a certain IP range to git-shell?\n\nA: You could use a ForceCommand along with Match:\nMatch Address 10.1.0.0/16\n    ForceCommand /usr/bin/git-shell\n\n\nFrom man sshd_config:\n Match   Introduces a conditional block.  ...\n         The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or\n         the single token All which matches all criteria.

I find the program to be extremely reliable and if it doesn't help you find the sizes of your other partitions, then I do not know what else to recommend. If you're only using the command line, then check out parted.\nI have never used fdisk, so I cannot properly answer question 2. I do know, however, that the fdisk program can be buggy, according to the \"BUGS\" section of its man page. The page recommends other fdisk variants, such as cfdisk, and also recommends parted.\nI hope my answers help you to find a solution to this issue.\n", "Q: Wifi Dies and doesnt Reconnect after Suspend Option (Ubuntu 14.04) Before I get started, yes I have googled this problem LOL, this one seems to be the one that works:\n13.10 suspend kills wifi connection\nThe code that helps alot of people is this:\n[CODE]sudo touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/wakenet.sh\nsudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/wakenet.sh\nsudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/wakenet.sh\nInsert the following lines:\n  #!/bin/bash case \"$1\" in thaw|resume) nmcli nm sleep false ;; *) ;; esac exit $?

I don't know why, but the program still works well for me, and it has worked for you as well. \nBut I understand if the errors concern you; you can try using the nano text editor instead of gedit. It is command line-based. Just replace gedit with nano when you are entering a command. To save, use Ctrl+O, and to exit, Ctrl+X.

I've tried both Kdenlive and Openshot and get the same results. All other audio works. All other digital movie files work fine. It's just the one's I'm rendering that have this issue.\n\nA: You need newer versions of libmlt6 and libmlt++3 than what Ubuntu 14.10 shipped.  15.04 already has the newer packages.\nYou can work around the problem on your 14.10 system by simply grabbing the newer version from 15.04 and installing them:\ncd $(mktemp -d)\nwget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libmlt%2B%2B3_0.9.2%2Bgit20141027-1_amd64.deb\nwget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libmlt6_0.9.2%2Bgit20141027-1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -Oi *deb\n\n\nA: Ok I have found a solution to this problem, this is a bug in mlt which was updated with the upgrade to 14.10. It's not related to pulse-audio!\nAnyway the solution it's just to install the latest debian version of the package which has a bugfix for this problem. \nSo you have to install libmlt6 and libmlt++3 (version 0.9.2+git20141027-1 for both packages, which are dependent on each other). \nSo you go here: http://packages.debian.org/sid/libmlt6\nand here: http://packages.debian.org/sid/libmlt++3\nand in both pages at the bottom there's the option to Download the package, you choose your architecture and download both packages. \nThen you have to put both packages in the same folder, open that folder in the terminal and type \"sudo dpkg -i libmlt++3_0.9.2+git20141027-1_amd64.deb libmlt6_0.9.2+git20141027-1_amd64.deb\" where the name of the two packages can change if you have a different architecture than amd64.\nThese are the links to the bug in debian:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=760773\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=761593 \nNow I will try to notify the ubuntu developers to backport the package to 14.10.\n\nA: Thanks peoples.

Following a tutorial for Linode to host a server securely, I disabled root user.\nI have regular user, and I can always type in sudo if I want to make changes. The problem exists when I try to FTP stuff into these folders that I would need to type in sudo.\nAny ideas how I can directly upload to these folders? If not, whats my best option? Upload to my user folder and copy everything?\n\nA: I am still a newbie so this may not be correct. \nYou mentioned that you wanted to host your server securely and want to FTP stuff. Now I was under the impression that FTP was not the most secure way to transfer files. Maybe I am wrong.\nI wonder if scp would achieve what you want? \nSorry to post a link but there is a lot of information here that could be useful. \nIn Unix, how do I use SCP to securely transfer files between two computers?\n - In Unix, you can use SCP (the scp command) to securely copy files and directories between remote hosts without starting an FTP session or logging into the remote systems explicitly. The scp command uses SSH to transfer data, so it requires a password or passphrase for authentication. Unlike rcp or FTP, scp encrypts both the file and any passwords exchanged so that anyone snooping on the network cannot view them.\n\nA: Well, if your ftp user does not have write permission for the folder he is supposed to, he won't be able to. Either give that user write permissions to the specific folder, or ftp the files to a directory where he has write right, and then log in via ssh and move the files around.\nscp is also a more secure and as convenient way to copy some files to a server with ssh running.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.10: wifi dropping out My wifi connection keeps failingon xubuntu 14.10 beta2 (I had the same on 11.4, I updated because I read that the kernel update fixed it): it's suddenly unable to connect to anything.

How can I safely reset the Unity desktop while not touching MATE 1.8.1?\n\nA: Open a terminal and execute the following command:\nsudo apt-get install compiz-config-settings-manager\n\nFirst, login to a Unity session. If you have no way to execute commands because of no interface, press Ctrl + Alt + F2 after you login to Unity and login to a text session with your username and password.\nNow, execute the following command:\nDISPLAY=:0 ccsm\n\nand press Ctrl + Alt + F7 to return to unity.\nOn the compizconfig-settings-manager, scroll down to and select the Unity plugin. Make sure this is enabled with a check in the box to the lower left hand side. This should startup the unity desktop.\n\nIf you still need to reset unity and or compiz, continue with these instructions. The old unity --replace command is depreciated but you can download the newer unity-replace script that aims to provide the same function.\nTo install unity-replace, open a terminal and execute the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install gdebi dconf-tools\nwget https://launchpad.net/~amith/+archive/ubuntutools/+build/3910667/+files/unity-reset_0.1-8_all.deb\nsudo gdebi unity-reset_0.1-8_all.deb\nunity-reset\n\nTo reset compiz, execute the following command:\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nLog out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\nmore info from webupd8\ndownload the script from github \n", "Q: How to compile GRUB2 I'm looking for the way to build GRUB2 from scratch.

I have tried droid mono, and other default ones that come with Ubuntu.\nI am using Android Studio 0.86, Oracle's Java 7 on Ubuntu 12.04 with Nvidia drivers. \n\nA: The problem is not anti-aliasing - all of your examples show the text is anti-aliased fine.\nThe difference is in an aspect of font rendering called \"hinting\" - the top Ubuntu Mono example shows a strong hinting, whereas the bottom Ubuntu Mono example shows a smoother hinting.  Hinting deforms the letter shapes to better align to the pixel grid and give a more crisp appearance.\nWhether you like one or the other is a matter of personal preference.  The top one is certainly very clear to read but at the expense of deforming the letter shapes.\nThe Java environment will be using its own font renderer rather than your global settings, hence the difference.\nThere are various fixes for this described in this link at stackoverflow.com:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/17510099/ugly-fonts-in-java-applications-on-ubuntu\nThis one looks pretty simple (I have not tested this):\nTry adding\nexport _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=gasp'\n\nto your ~/.bashrc\nBut the chosen solution is more complex.\n\nA: Found very easy and very tricky solution\nlink to video\nThe dude just made a link to a jre from Intellij Idea folder and put it to android studio folder and vuala!\n\nA: to resolve JAVA Picked up Option:\njust follow the simple step:\nopen a terminal:\nsudo -i\n[sudo] password for amit: ******* <------ Your system password\ngedit /etc/profile\n\n{now one editor will be open don't delete any thing, in the last part where you set your JAVA PATH after fi just write \nunset _JAVA_OPTIONS\n\nand save it and close\nafter that type again into your terminal\nexit\n. /etc/profile\n\nall get set now check\njava -version\njava version \"1.8.0_112\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-b15)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.112-b15, mixed mode)\n\n", "Q: Fresh Server 14.04 install: \"Unable to locate package (xyz)\" for everything; How do I edit sources.list?

I also cleared all repositories from    /etc/apt/sources.list.d\nAfter removing Pantheon I came across a few things that didn't work like they used to:\n1: Windows/Super Key does not open the overlay anymore. I cannot set this back in key-bindings.\n2: Desktop background/appearances no longer works. Right clicking the desktop and selecting 'change desktop background' simply opens the gnome-control-center, where the 'background/appearance' option does not exist. Similarly, there is a 'background' option in the overlay of all my installed applications, however, it does the same as the desktop right-click option.\n3: Same as #2 but for backups.\n4: Now for some reason, I cannot install the 'places indicator applet' from extensions.gnome.org.\nThings I have tried:\nCompletely remove gnome-shell and all configs and re-installing.\nReverted GTK from 3.12 (needed for Pantheon) back to 3.10(ubuntu stock).\nSetting XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME to ensure it wasn't assuming pantheon was the default desktop for some reason.\nI have attached a screenshot showing the overlay with the 'background' and 'backups' options available (circled in red). In the bottom-right corner is a screenshot of what my gnome-control-center menu actually has for options.

I am trying Ubuntu 12.04 on it and it cannot find my wifi. I believe this is due to missing the driver for my network adapter. It's 2x2 11b/g/n Wireless LAN M.2 (Realtek 802.11d RTL8192EE).

But, it appears to have hung and there is no progress bar. How many minutes/hours should I wait before giving up and powering off the machine?\nAlso - can Ubuntu handle in this type of installation an HP machine as delivered from the factory which will have the maximum amount of partitions used - one for Windows, one for OS Recovery, and one for their Diagnostic Tools?\nEDIT: Based on answers below I downloaded a free Windows partition tool called  MiniTool® Partition Wizard Home Edition 8.1.1. My HP computer did not have 3 partions (Windows, Tools, Recovery) as I expected, but only [Windows, Recovery]. I shrank the Windows partition and created a 8GB swap and a 128GB ext4 mounted to / (wasn't brave enough to try a extra  /home). Then I reran the installation CD and chose \"Something Else\" and was able to get an install.\nFrom this question/answer it seems that the Ubuntu \"Alongside them\" option can hang if it finds something besides a single Windows partition occupying the hard drive.\n\nA: This should not require that much time. Normally 30-40 secs is required. In this time, Ubuntu decide which partition should be used for it, make room for Ubuntu by shrinking (if needed) an existing partition and then start installation. It seems, your Notebook has a configuration which is problematic for Ubuntu.\nI suggest you to restart the process by again. You should choose \"Something else\" option instead of \"Alongside... \" option. Then shrink a partition, make two partition on the new free space (one for / and one for swap) and then go.\n\nA: when i dual boot i usually do this in windows before i install ubuntu:  make a 2048 mb partiton for swap, make a 100 gb partition for the ubuntu install.    stop where you are and do that first or else you will screw up the boot loader and you will BRICK  the computer.  then when you go thru the install choose \"something else\".  make the 2048 your swap and make the 100 your install partition.  good luck...\n", "Q: ubuntu server: network precedence (wired before wifi) I'm running Ubuntu Server 14.04, and have both \"auto wlan0\" and \"auto p4p1\" in my /etc/network/interfaces file as I have both a wifi card and a network port (described here).

You can perform operation such as resizing or deleting partitions from Ubuntu itself using GParted: right click on target partition (except the current Ubuntu partition itself) and unmount it, then you can modify the partition. Do be careful when working with partitions.\nIf it is the Ubuntu partition itself you want to modify, then you will either have to use a Live CD or Live USB. Or being fancy, you can have multiple Ubuntu installation in the same hard disk on a different partition from the first Ubuntu installation.

If not:\nsudo apt-get install vim-addon-manager\n\nAnd then run the command given in the README. vim-syntastic is only available for 14.10, from the results in the package index, but given that it explicitly depends on vim-addon-manager, I'd say something similar applies to it as well.\n\nA: You can choose use to use vim-pathogen, I think it is available on Ubuntu.

It resets to 100% on every reboot. \nI have tried searching for solutions but none of them worked[including xbacklight ].\nSince I can change screen brightness by pressing Fn + F3 a couple of times , I was wondering if I could make a script do it on every reboot?\n\nA: Alternative way\nWriting a script to press a key combination to set your screen's brightness seems a bit of a detour to me. You can directly set your screen brightness on log in by adding the command:\nxrandr --output <your_screenname> --brightness 0.7\n\nto your startup applications. Of course, instead of 0.7 (=70%), you can use any value you prefer.\nReplace <your_screenname> by the actual name of your screen. Find out your screen's name by looking into the output of the command:\nxrandr\n\nLook for the word connected; the name before that is your screen's name\nAdd the command to your startup applications\nOpen Startup Applications (Dash > Startup Applications) and choose \"Add\". Add the command above and next time you log in, your screen's brightness will be set automaically to the value you defined in the command.\n\nA: The brightness of an Ubuntu system is maintained as numbers in 3 files brightness, max_brightness and actual_brightness in /sys/class/backlight/<VGA>directory.\nReplace <VGA> with intel_backlight if you are having an Intel VGA card and radeon_bl0 if you are having an AMD card.\nYou may check the value in the max_brightness file and based on that, set a value in the brightness file. So when the system reboots, the brightness actually resets to the value in the brightness file.\nYou won't be needing a custom script to reset brightness.\n", "Q: How to clear all global keyboard shortcuts without \"SUPER\"? Is there a quick and easy way that deletes ALL global keyboard shortcuts not involving the SUPER key?\nI am asking because in my opinion, the SUPER key is the SYSTEM key. If it is not involved, no system shortcut should be triggered. That is also to avoid conflicts with application-dependent shortcuts, which are often overridden by many of Ubuntu's default system-wide shortcuts. So many in fact, that I don't want to do it manually through the keyboard system manager. In addition, I cannot even find some shortcuts in that manager. E.g. in a game I am using ALT+Q and nothing happens in the game, even though the shortcut manager does not list this combination.\nIs there a way to quickly list/erase ALL shortcuts matching some condition, possibly through the command line?\nThis has been causing me quite a headache already. Not to forget the fact that accidentally pressing some key combinations can have severe (or just very annoying) consequences.\n\nA: Most Unity desktop shortcuts are Compiz ones:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ccsm\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Launch ccsm\n\n*Preferences → Export\n\n*Do you want to skip default option values while exporting your profile? NO\n\n*Copy exported file to leave a backup then open it with Gedit.\n\n*All Compiz shortcuts are there. Modify what you want then Import it back again.\n\n\nSometimes, it's hard know what the shortcut do.

During installation it deleted all my windows partitions: D:, E: and F:.\nHow can I recover my deleted partition data? \nI read a post regarding recovering data using testdisk. But it recommends having an external hard drive with double the capacity of the existing hard drive. At present, I do not have such a hard drive. Is there any other way?\n\nA: That is correct, you need another disk to store the recovered files that the software is able to find on the disk, because writing to the same disk would cause more technical difficulties in the recovery process by overwriting other data also should have been recovered.\nWith modern spinning disk hard drives the consensus is that what has been overwritten is lost. So the sectors which contained data that have been actually overwritten by the installation of a new operating system should be considered definitively lost, the other data might be recoverable.\nYou should always have more than one hard drive when handling different operating systems or performing non-reversible commands and also heed the warning messages and notices (there was at least one when you did that).

I was told to paste the following link that I got from using the Boot-Repair tool: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8676303/\nAny help on how I can get this computer to boot would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\nEdit:\nThis is what I see when I try to boot my computer:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxyshf5J82QSRG1oRFhHT0RxWEk/view?usp=sharing\nif I then go to \"Start VAIO Care (Rescue Mode)\", I get the option to boot from my USB-stick.\nFrom here, I can boot the computer from the USB-stick. But I still cannot get into my Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: Before you proceed, If you don't want any headache at the beginning it self just go to last two lines of my answer.\nWell since you have confirmed that you have installed Ubuntu there are two possibilities.\nIn the question you have mentioned I can't boot Ubuntu (or anything), other than from the USB-stick\n\n\n*\n\n*May be your boot order in BIOS is set to boot from USB device first.\n\n\nSolution: Simply remove your USB device and try to reboot, if not worked, use bios key to inter BIOS and change boot order. If that doesn't work,\nThis may not be a perfect answer but its worth to give it a try.\n\n\n*Since here it says => No boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda., may be you have to reinstall Grub boot loader to MBR(Master Boot Record). The reason I'm suggesting this solution is because this post states similar problem. Follow the steps below. But before installing grub boot loader try toggling the boot flag from Method:1 if the /dev/sda is not bootable.\n\n\nThis method needs command prompt but it has not mentioned how to go to command prompt when the OS is itself not able to load. Hence I assume you have to press letter \"c\" when grub menu appears. Reboot and when grub menu appears, press c to open command line. Then enter, \nSource for this method\nMethod 1:\nIt's assumed that /dev/sda is the disk which contains a boot partition.\nFirst, using fdisk command, verify that the boot partition (typically the first partition) in /dev/sda is tagged as \"bootable\". If the partition is bootable, it should show \"*\" under \"Boot\" column(with * symbol) in the fdisk output.\n\nfdisk /dev/sda\n\npress P to list the partitions after it shows\n\nCommand (m for help): p\n\nIf the boot partition is not bootable, mark it as \"bootable\". You can press \"a\" on fdisk to toggle a bootable flag. After changing a bootable flag, make sure to press \"w\" to write the change to disk.\nThen use the Method 2 to install the GRUB bootloader.\nSource for this method.\nMethod 2: Note: Since you are new to Ubuntu, keep this in mind. In the below commands # symbol, > symbol and the text before > symbol should be shown in your command line, and not to be typed as a command.\neg: In the below command, # grub-install /dev/sda, you have to type only grub-install /dev/sda.\n\n# grub-install /dev/sda\n\nIt has said in the source that this is an automatic re-installation method. If that fails, start by launching the grub command shell manually.\n\n# grub\n\nIf your not sure of the device to specify for the installation, you can ask GRUB to tell you. Run this command and GRUB will attempt to find your GRUB installation on all available device partitions on the system. If found GRUB will output all the partitions containing GRUB installations in GRUB naming format. You can select the correct device and use in the next step.\n\ngrub> find /boot/grub/menu.lst\n\nThe output will be something like\n\n(hd0,0)\n\nSet your root partition which contains the boot directory as well as the GRUB installation.\n\ngrub> root (hd0,0)\n\nInstall GRUB to the MBR of your first hard drive device.\n\ngrub> setup (hd0)\n\nExit Grub.\n\ngrub> quit\n\nReboot, you should hopefully see the menu on start up.\n\n# reboot\n\nHope this helps.\nIf everything else failed just reinstall the whole Ubuntu OS and make sure you format(Windows installed partition) before you install Ubuntu on it.\n", "Q: How to share files in local network?

Use this to transfer your files to the cloud and then download them on the phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Windows Phone developers may want the user to adopt these wireless techniques instead or direct USB transfers. The Windows Phone Support page about file transfers from a PC is kind of indirect: “If, though, you still want to transfer files through USB...”.\n\n\n*Have you tried downloading the “File Manager” app (the official one from Microsoft Corporation) to your phone to browse these files in your phone’s storage?\n\n*Make sure your media files aren’t protected for copyright reasons and meant to be played only on one device. Try sending these files through a MTP client installed on your Ubuntu PC (Qlix or GMTP are available in the Ubuntu Software Center).\nI hope one of these three ways works out for you.\n\nA: You can also use the app Music Drop:\nhttp://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/music-drop/09a12ce5-26ec-4251-b7a1-16216de4c2fb\nWorks fine for me!\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on Laptop without affecting windows bootloader Ok. I am a Linux user but I purchased a laptop with Windows 8.1 pre-installed...\nLAPTOP INFOS:\nLenovo G50\n64-bit\nIntel i5 processor\n4GB of RAM\nSupports USB 3.0\n\nI wanna install Ubuntu 14.10 on a USB 3.0 thumb drive without affecting the windows bootloader and files. Yes, there is an option to install it alongside windows but what happened on my other computer when I used that option is this:\nWindows Boot Manager appears every boot and asks me to choose between Ubuntu and Windows 8 and I HATE THAT.\nWHAT I WANT:\nInstall Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit on an 8GB USB 3.0 thumb drive but it should not appear on Windows Boot Menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you ask me...\"How do you want to access Ubuntu if you don't wanna appear it on Win. Boot Menu?\"\n\n\nANSWER:\n\n\n*\n\n*I wanna boot if from choosing the USB device from my computer's BIOS... on boot devices.\n\n\nSo what I want is like \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" but the OS is installed on the thumb drive and you can save files on it. And if possible use the thumb drive to boot Ubuntu on other computers which supports UEFI. What I want is like a portable OS and you can save files on it.\n\nA: I have done this a few years back and what I did was just a plain install on a USB device and also installed Grub on it. So when chosen from BIOS boot menu, the USB drive loads Grub in which you choose Ubuntu. Should be simple and straightforward.\nWhat also comes to mind too is chroot (using existing Ubuntu installation which you don't have). Here I am assuming that /dev/sda is hard drive with existing Ubuntu installation and /dev/sdb is USB stick. You require a existing installation of Ubuntu for this and a Live CD of almost any Debian based distro. All command require sudo before them or sudo -i as a step 0.\n\n\n*\n\n*create partitions on USB drive (using gparted)\ngparted /dev/sdb\n\n*copy content from disk to USB partitions while Ubuntu is offline (with another live CD or similar). Something like:\n\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/existing-install/\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb-stick-install/\ncp -rp /mnt/existing-install/* /mnt/usb-stick-install/\n\n\n*bind mount what is needed /dev; /proc; and /sys probably\n\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/usb-stick-install/dev\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/usb-stick-install/proc\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/usb-stick-install/sys\n\n\n*chroot into USB\nchroot /mnt/usb-stick-install/\n\n*run grub-install --recheck /dev/sdb\n\n*restart and check if it boots\n\n\nThough I'd first try a plain install, it should work fine.\n\nA: You can use Universal USB Installer to make a bootable Ubuntu USB drive and use the persistence option available there. This would allow you to set a persistent file of some size that you would decide and which would be a fixed size. You can then use that USB drive on any PC and boot as a normal Live CD but infact would be able to save files which wont get lost after shutdown.\nI am mentioning this particular option because you wanted to use a 8 GB USB drive. \nUpdate:\nBased on the comment below, you want a bootable fully functional USB drive with the GRUB bootloader existing in the USB only and not interfering with the windows setup.\nThere's a guide at Ubuntu Forums which had helped me do the setup that you desire. I had done it on a 160 GB HDD but the instructions should work fine for a USB drive too.\n\nA: It is really easy. you'll need two USB drives for doing this. First, copy the Ubuntu ISO to a spare USB A for installing it into the other one named B. Plug both the USBs to the computer and then boot from A. Then,find the name of the partition of the USB B, as per the Linux file system. \nSuppose, the device name is sdb. It will have partition inside the sdb such as sdb1, sdb2 etc.\nThen click on Install Ubuntu. Choose Do Something Else.\nChoose the partition, i.e.:sdb1/ sdb2 and double click on it and choose ext4 journal file system. and set mount point as / (root).\nThen, in the bottom of the window, there will be an option to fill the name of the device for Bootloader installation. Choose it as sdb  IMPORTANT: CHOOSE THE DEVICE NAME, NOT THE PARTITION for the Bootloader installation. i.e: choose sdb here. Not sdb1 or sdb2\nThen carry on with the installation. After you are done, shut down, remove USB A and go to the boot menu and choose the USB B for booting.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu over Win 8 without disabling UEFI?

The root problem: for some reason, on boot, Ubuntu 14.04 disables (mutes) the S/PDIF output on my sound card. \nThis question and its answers indicate that sudo alsactl store will store the alsamixer settings once I've unmuted the S/PDIF output, but on boot, the S/PDIF output is muted again. \nIn /var/lib/alsa/asound.state (pastebin) there is one PDIF entry, which I've set to \"true\" and saved; this has resulted in solving auto-mute for my \"Phantom Jack\" but there's no other entry for the \"true\" S/PDIF in asound.state that I can manually adjust. \nThere's also an empty /var/lib/alsa/asound.state.lock file (11 bytes, blank in gedit) in the /alsa/ directory.

But using .profile and amixer, no need to \"sudo\" and it will unmute  at every session start for your login.\n\nA: I adapted @laugeo's answer to fix the problem with my headphones.\nThe problem was that the headphone was set to unmute but it was on 00 volume. \nI wanted it to be 100, so I added this: /usr/bin/amixer -c 0 set Headphone playback 100% unmute\nAnd the .unmute script looks like:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 10 \n/usr/bin/amixer -c 0 set Headphone playback 100% unmute\nexit\n\nIf you want to unmute and set volume to 100% just change the channel. For example for master channel:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 10 \n/usr/bin/amixer -c 0 set Master playback 100% unmute\nexit\n\n\nA: When I run sudo alsactl store it gives me the following error\nalsactl: get_controls:567: snd_ctl_open error: Invalid argument.\n\nI needed to unmute the Master channel using\namixer set Master 100 unmute\n\nand it worked perfectly for currently selected sound card. But the Master channel was always muted again after boot, so I created a script named unmute.sh and set chmod 700 so that other users couldn't run it. I filled the script with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\namixer set Master 100 unmute\n\nand saved it to ~/.kde/Autostart directory. If you have Kubuntu or other distro with KDE all scripts in that directory will be run on boot automatically.\nIf you don't have KDE you can try to add the amixer command to ~/.profile file.\n\nA: This worked for me after trying everything else; in term -\nsudo nautilus\n\nopen /etc/pulse/default.pa\nhash out (add a #) to the beginning of the line reading \nmodule-device-restore\nalsamixer\n\nun-mute volume marked (M) use left / right keys to select, up down to adjust levels.\nsudo reboot\n\nThis worked for me; copied from here; Arch linux forum\nGood luck - hope it works for you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - TP-Link TL-WN727N I just bought a TP-Link TL-WN727N wireless USB adapter.

There you can add the multiple images.\n\nAs the question asks for inverting colors, add the corresponding manipulation set: Add - Other GIMP procedure, search for 'invert' and you will find 'gimp-invert'\n\nOK, and before 'Apply' you can set the output folder which by default is ~/.\nHope that helps.

The procedure had to be repeated on every boot.\nAfter further investigation, I stumbled upon the following remark in the [release notes of 14.10][1]:\n\nNote. If you were using the gnome3-team/gnome3-staging PPA, you should run\n\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging  \n\n\nbefore upgrading.\n\nI purged the ppa, reinstalled gnome-shell, added the ppa and ran dist-upgrade. Finally, I set gdm as default display manager (thanks Xieerqi). It works again!\n\nA: Try this.

I've encountered such issue with Fedora 20, where default gdm greeter would distort the login screen badly, and the persons on this post also said changing greeter (as suggested by myself) helped.\nTo change a greeter, access tty console (by pressing Ctrl+Alt +F*, where F* is any F1 - F6 key), login, and download a greeter that you would like to have. For instance,\nsudo apt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\nor \nsudo apt-get install lightdm-kde-greeter\n\nPersonally , I keep both of these on my machine.\nNext, you need to tell lightdm desktop manager which greeter to choose on boot. To do that, type\nsudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nNano is a command-line text editor, IMHO simplest to use. Most likely, this config file will be blank, so you would need to add the following lines:\n[SeatDefaults] \ngreeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\nwhere lightdm-gtk-greeter , would be the name of the greeter you installed. Bellow is the screen shot of my lightdm.conf file.\n\nFor more information on lightdm display manager configurations, you can read the following sources, as well as man page for lightdm (man lightdm):\nArch Wiki Lightdm \nUbuntu Help Lightdm\n\nA: To me, it appears that gdm starts too early. The following consistently seems to help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to a console via combination Ctrl+Alt+F1\n\n*Login\n\n*Issue the command sudo service gdm restart\n\n*If necessary, switch back to the graphical user interface via combination Ctrl+Alt+F1\nThe list of users appears.\nIt's strange that this issue appeared only after some time on my machine, after installing/upgrading a few packages on a clean system. Is it something like a boot order dependency issue?\nEDIT: Adding a \"sleep\" to the init script that starts gdm actually kind of resolved the issue for me. Add the command sleep 2 as first line of the script block in /etc/init/gdm.conf. This seems to support the dependency hypothesis -- but of course is relevant only if you run GDM and not LightDM. YMMV.\n", "Q: How to disable mediascanner-service? I've installed ubuntu-sdk and it depends among others on mediascanner2.0. I generally despise all such scanners/trackers and I'd like to disable it. But I can't find a way.\nThe config is in /usr/share/upstart/sessions/mediascanner-2.0.conf\n\nA: If you are sure you will not miss the \"service\" of mediascanner :o), just remove/purge it from installed packages:\n\nsudo apt-get purge mediascanner2.0\n\nAnd you can also purge the libmediascanner:\n\nsudo apt-get purge mediascanner2.0 libmediascanner-2.0-0\n\nlibmediascanner comes together with mediascanner2 in Ubuntu update.

You can see this by piping through a program like od which will let you see non-printing characters. For example, this command prints the \"wa\" and \"hi\" fields of the 3rd line of top:\n$ top -d 1 -n 1 | grep ^% | cut -d\",\" -f5,6\n\nThe output on my system is:\n\n1.0 wa,  0.0 hi\n\nLet's have a look at the non-printing characters:\n$ top -d 1 -n 1 | grep ^% | cut -d\",\" -f5,6 | od -c\n0000000 033   (   B 033   [   m 033   [   3   9   ;   4   9   m 033   [\n0000020   1   m           1   .   0     033   (   B 033   [   m 033   [\n0000040   3   9   ;   4   9   m   w   a   , 033   (   B 033   [   m 033\n0000060   [   3   9   ;   4   9   m 033   [   1   m           0   .   0\n0000100     033   (   B 033   [   m 033   [   3   9   ;   4   9   m   h\n0000120   i  \\n\n0000122\n\nAs you can see above, the third character is a B and that's what you're getting. So, assuming you want a script that i) prints all of top's output, ii) prints the \"wa\" and \"hi\" fields of the 3rd line and iii) prints the digits from the \"wa\" field, you could do something like:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nx=\"$(top -d 1 -n 1)\"\necho \"$x\"\nwaitingForHDD=$(grep ^% <<<\"$x\" | cut -d\",\" -f5,6)\necho \"$waitingForHDD\"     \nb=$(grep -oP '^.*?\\K[.\\d]+(?= )' <<<\"$waitingForHDD\" )\necho \"$b\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 failed - Dell When upgrading from ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04..system installs upgrades and hangs at one or the other place....have tried it three times....here are the issues i face\n\n\n*\n\n*update installation fails at one or the other place \n\n*there after system does not start and i have to go back to factory settings (12.04)\n\n*cannot try this process repeatedly as first i have to upgrade 12.04 to latest then download 1900+ files for 14.04 and then installation starts which fails\n\n*entire cycle takes 3-4 hours...\n\n*have tried one suggested command to un-install cinnamon....did not work\n\n\nplz suggest steps with complete instructions to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 (new to Linux)\nor suggest a full proof process to move to 14.04 - format and direct installation tof 14.04 (if it is a sure shot process)\nIt stuck during installing upgrade at \"Preparing fonts-khmeros-core\" at terminal last line i see is \"preparing to unpack..../fonts - lao_0.0.20060226-9_all.deb.....\"\nSoftware index is broken - it is impossible to install or remove any software\n\nA: Try to remove all the PPA's from your PPA list.

It's a cloud service: you get 15GB storage for free (20GB using a referral link), and install the App onto your iDevice.

So this is why I'm looking for a native program.\nI know that there are standalone rippers like RipperX, but I'd prefer a solution which has the ripper included in the music player.\nMy currently preferred music player is Clementine, which can play Audio CD's, but fails at ripping them. It'd be nice if there was a ripping plugin for Clementine, since I would rather keep my current player.\n\nA: There are players that can rip audio CDs, but one should consider the fact that this procedure may be tricky, not all are equally good, and specialized tools would fit the purpose better: Sound Juicer and Asunder in Gnome and related desktops, Audex, SoundKonverter and Asunder in KDE.\nOne of the most striking difference between all these (whether players or separate ripping tools) comes with CDs for which the metadata is not easy to find. You may need to try different tools to get the proper track names, so it's better to have 2 or 3  different such tools installed. (From my experience, Deadbeef, Qmmp, Amarok and Asunder rarely miss.)\nThat said, the already mentioned Rhythmbox is fine, except in KDE. For KDE, see below. It can even read the CD-Text data (track info present on the CD itself that can be accessed offline but not all players can read)\n\nDeadbeef can work very well on all desktops and it is very light.\nTo get the CDDB info, version 6.2 needs you to un-check the option \"Prefer CD-Text over CDDB\" (under Preferences-Plugins-Audio CD player-Configure) - because of a bug.\n\nDeadbeef can also read CD-Text.\nIn the past some codecs needed to be installed - like so - possibly this is not needed, but you can test\nsudo apt-get install faac flac lame musepack-tools vorbis-tools wavpack\n\n \nTo start an Audio CD directly in Deadbeef the command to use is deadbeef all.cda. (That can be used in a launcher/icon etc.)\nWait for the CDDB metadata or CD-Text to be read. Before converting, you may select files and reload CDDB\n \n\nTo adjust converting settings, one cannot edit or remove the default configurations, but new ones can be created based on the default ones. Just select one of those as if to edit,\n\nthen select copy: \n\nthat will open the  'add new encoder' window. Make changes there (for example, for FLAC, level 8 is maximum compression), press ok and a new configuration is added.\n\nMore details in a special answer on this topic,here.\n\n\nBanshee is still a good solution (but avoid it in KDE).\n\nOnce inserted, the Audio CD is displayed in the left pane. Select it, it will fetch the online track info. Press Import CD in the top right corner to rip. To set the ripping options right click Audio CD in the left pane, Audio CD Preferences (OR - Edit - Preferences in main menus), then: Source specific - Source - Audio CDs\n\nYou can chose between Wav, mp3, flac and ogg with various settings.

However someone set them up 4 years ago and didn't document how, so I  my question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I setup a sandboxed home directory with AuFS? \n\n\nIn the current fstab file there is the following entry:\nnone /home/student aufs br:/home/.student_rw:/home/student 0 0\n\nBut I don't really understand what this means. Can someone elaborate? The aim is a clean home directory, that restores after every reboot, but you have to be able to change something if you unmount it first as superuser.\n\nA: AuFS started as an implementation of UnionFS Union File System.\nAn union filesystem takes an existing filesystem and transparently overlays it on a newer filesystem. \nTo install aufs:\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\nsudo -i\napt-get update\napt-get install aufs-tools\n\nHow to mount two directories of a same filesystem:\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\nsudo -i\nmkdir /tmp/rw\nmkdir /tmp/aus\nmount -t aufs -o br=/tmp/rw:/home/user none /tmp/aus/\n\nThe first two commands created two new directories in /tmp. \nThe mount.aufs is the command to mount the filesystem.\nThe mount command, specifies it is going to union mount /tmp/rw and /home/user under /tmp/aus. \nThe directory /tmp/aus will have the content of both /tmp/rw and /home/user.\nThe options are used in mount command are:\n-o – specifies options to be passed to the filesystem\nbr – specifies a branch, where each branch is separated by colon (:).\nnone – specifies we don’t have any device associated with it.\n\nmkdir /tmp/rw /tmp/aufs\nmount -t aufs -o br=/tmp/rw:${HOME} none /tmp/aufs\nor\nmount -t aufs -o br=/tmp/rw=rw:${HOME}=ro none /tmp/aufs\n\nThen, you can see whole tree of your home dir through /tmp/aufs. \nIf you modify a file under /tmp/aufs, the one on your home directory is not affected, instead the same named file will be newly created under /tmp/rw. \nAnd all of your modification to a file will be applied to the one under /tmp/rw. \nSource: http://aufs.sourceforge.net/\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch Qt3D 2.0 crashes on start I've been trying to develop something in QML3D and while my app is running well on desktop, I can't get it working on my tablet (even thought for example Qt3D cylinder from the software center - https://github.com/Sturmflut/ubuntu-touch-qt3d-cylinder - is working just well).\nI've come down to the easiest application having only the emplty viewport but it still crashes on my tablet.

The commands may not translate 1to1 for your Ubuntu system, but this entry might point you in the right direction:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improve_boot_performance\nI am sorry, but reducing device-specific boot time is nothing a short answer on askubuntu can handle, you will have to look at every item in your startup routine and decide whether it is necessary or not and disable the system components accordingly.\n\nA: This is one of those applications where you basically start subtracting until you break something and then back off. Like for instance, I don't think your robot is likely using zeroconf which is the avahi daemon, so uninstall it. Do you really need networking? Or better, boot into single user mode (append 1 to kernel cmdline) and then see how many services you have to turn on before your application starts working.\n\nA: Which size division are you in? I realize this may not be the answer you're looking for here, but for something time critical like standing up within 10 seconds, I would go with an embedded platform.\nIf you have the space / power budget, you should consider sticking something like an arduino on the robot, and programming some open-loop stand-up behaviors. You can still use ubuntu on the main board. I'd suggest something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have an arduino (or similar) that receives a regular heartbeat signal from the ubuntu server\n\n*If more than X heartbeat intervals go by, the arduiono takes control, and reboots the server\n\n*The arduino can directly drive the motors (or through whatever motor controller you're using) and issues a stand-up command, which allows the robot to \"recover\" and not get disqualified, while your main system boots up\n\n*\n\n*Pre-program a few stand-up behaviors, possibly based on which way the robot is facing, and then select one of them based on an accelerometer\n\n*If you aren't in one of the legged divisions, then just write some cheesy code on the ardiuno to make it look like the robot is doing something while the server boots up\n\n\n*Once the system boots up, it will send another heartbeat, and the arduino can release control\n\n\nThere are answers here which can help you improve boot time (turn stuff off until you break it, basically), but even then, if loosing power is a common enough problem, something like this could be very helpful.\n\nA: Try reducing storage buffer to 4 MB.

Now that I have set up the Share on my Mac (made it public/all) how do I now find this folder using Ubuntu? \nIdeally, I want the 'shared folder' to go on my desktop in Ubuntu.\nThx\n\nA: To have a Virtualbox shared folder on the Ubuntu guest's desktop we will have to create a shared folder to then mount it. See these related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Error mounting VirtualBox shared folders in an Ubuntu guest\n\n*How to mount a VirtualBox shared folder at startup?\n\n*How to access a shared folder in VirtualBox?\nIf this was successful we need to give our Ubuntu user privileges to read (or write) these shared folders by granting them access to the group vboxsf.

I have windows 7 installed on a SSD. I want to dual boot linux with it so I partitioned 60gigs of space for the root, home, and swap. I booted from a flash drive that I have linux loaded on and began the install. My system is set to UEFI so I set it to install the bootloader on the efi partition. \nThe install went fine, however when I restarted, it just loads windows 7 and never gives me an option to boot into my linux install. I'm assuming that Grub2 should be the default, but I'm guessing that windows boot manager is still the default. \nCan someone give me some clarification on what I need to do in order to get this to work?\nThanks\n\nA: You need to tell the EFI which boot image to use. The EFI remembers the last used boot image. Now, how exactly to do this depends on the EFI implementation. For example, on my Lenovo laptop I would enter the EFI setup by hitting a special button on the side of the computer. Then, I would go to the Boot tab and there is a list of bootloaders. You should see Ubuntu and a Windows Boot Manager of some kind. Use the designated keys to re-arrange the boot order.\nAlternatively, you should be able to set it from the LiveCD/USB by running efibootmgr . Note that the process below will only work if the CD/USB was booted in EFI mode, not compatibility/legacy/BIOS mode.\nsudo efibootmgr\n\nGives you a list of your current boot order. In order to change this, you have to type a long command that is highly dependant on your system. For example, my system boot order looks like this (note the BootOrder line):\nBootCurrent: 0001\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nBootOrder: 0001,0007,0002,0003,0000,0008,0009,000A,0005,2001\nBoot0000* Lenovo Recovery System\nBoot0001* ubuntu\nBoot0002* Windows Boot Manager\nBoot0003* Ubuntu\nBoot0005* Network Boot: Atheros Boot Agent\nBoot0007* Windows Boot Manager\nBoot0008* Internal HDD: SAMSUNG MZMPA016HMCD-000L1      \nBoot0009* SATA HDD    : ST1000LM024 HN-M101MBB          \nBoot000A* SATA ODD    : HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GU70N           \nBoot2001* EFI USB Device\n\nIt does 'ubuntu' first, followed by 'Windows Boot Manager', then 'Windows Boot Manager' (again?), then 'Ubuntu' (yet again? -- guess I gotta get that sorted out), then 'Lenovo Recovery System', etc.\nSo, in order to change my boot order to be Windows first, I would enter the command:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0007,0001,0002,0003,0000,0008,0009,000A,0005,2001\n\nThis will set it in the EFI so that 'Windows Boot Manager' loads first, followed by 'ubuntu'. Every thing else stays where it was.\nNote that some machines are hard coded to boot '[ESP]/BOOT/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi', (where [ESP] is your EFI system partition's filesystem) -- the Windows boot manager. However, simply copying '[ESP]/BOOT/ubuntu/bootx64.efi' to '[ESP]/Boot/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi' (after moving the original 'bootmgfw.efi' out of the way/backing it up of course) should suffice to fix the problem on those systems. If this is required, it can also be be done from within Ubuntu like this:\ncp /boot/EFI/BOOT/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi /boot/EFI/BOOT/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi.bak\ncp /boot/EFI/BOOT/ubuntu/bootx64.efi /boot/EFI/BOOT/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi\n\n\nA: An Alternative Workaround\n\n\n*\n\n*While booting your laptop press the button which brings up boot from device menu.\n\n*Select your drive where you installed Ubuntu.\n\n*It should prompt you to choose either Windows or Ubuntu.\n\n*Select Ubuntu.\n\n*Now download Ubuntu Boot-Repair and select recommended repair.\n\n*It will ask you to restart and should restart to GRUB menu.\n\n", "Q: How to replace a string of text with input from another file I am working on a script to configure a server.

I have tried the packaged 331 and the latest self-contained from nVidia; neither worked.  \nI have installed rEFInd but that has not helped; in fact, it will only boot if I select the EFI option. Selecting the second, conventional option just hangs immediately after the rEFInd window. Xubuntu is the only OS on this machine, and I formatted the disk with an msdos partition table. It also has FDE enabled.  \nI have tried some kernel flags; nomodeset is vital. I have also tried nopat which didn't help.  \nMy basic understanding is that BIOS Compatibility is not kicking in on the MBP hardware. As Xubuntu is the only OS on it, I have no issues reconfiguring the system until it works, if this is even possible; some searching reveals this is a very tricky issue and nVidia have washed their hands of it.

It will\n  just use the same mode that you have used to boot the installer. Once\n  you installed Ubuntu in this mode, it will be hard to change. In fact,\n  both modes have their own dedicated boot loaders that work differently\n  (package \"grub-pc\" for BIOS and package \"grub-efi-amd64\" for EFI).\nHow to boot in BIOS mode. Thus, you must make sure that your installer\n  boots in the right mode. For me, this worked by booting from a CD/DVD.\n...\nAt least in my boot loader, it seems to be impossible to boot from a\n  non-EFI USB stick. I could use USB sticks to boot, mainly to use a\n  live system to try and fix my installation, but these were always EFI\n  USB sticks that were then booted in EFI mode.\n\nThe solution is to burn a CD/DVD instead of using a USB stick. In this way it is indeed possible to force the Mac firmware to boot in BIOS mode, and Ubuntu will take from this that it should install the BIOS version of GRUB. Everything flows from there. However, based on my understanding, it is not possible to do this without a full reinstall.\nI hope this helps someone else.\n\nA: For people who arrive here after a search as I did (this was the result which ultimately got me back my Nvidia binary driver)...\nThe older answer says \"...not possible to do this without a full reinstall.\" But I wanted to give it a go anyway, and it turned out to be fairly easy.\nIt is possible to change back to a BIOS Grub without a reinstall.\nI switched from an EFI Grub to BIOS Grub on my good old Macbook Pro 4,1 ( A1261, 17\" version) with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the grub-pc package\n\n*remove the grub-efi package\n\n*I rebooted at least once here because I came back to it the next day\n\n*with parted, remove the EFI partition\n\n*update-grub\n\n*grub-install /dev/sda to install Grub to the MBR\n\n*(I don't know if one of the previous two is redundant. I did both because I was flailing a bit)\n\n*reboot\n\n*confirm the absence of /sys/firmware/efi\n\n*install Nvidia binary driver (I used version 304 successfully on this machine)\n\n\nLater, I remembered maybe I should set the 'boot' flag on partition 2 (which is the first one, now that I've killed off the EFI partition 1). This is the partition with the /boot filesystem on. It worked fine without the boot flag set, but I set it anyway.\nThis was on a fairly clean Linux Mint 17.2 installed from a thumb drive. Mint 17.2 is based on Ubuntu 14.04.\nLinux is the only OS on this machine. No OSX, No rEFIt/rEFInd. Just a bare Mint 17.2 installation.\nThe usual \"Back it up first!\" advice applies. :D\nI hope this helps someone.\n\nA: I worked around the same issues by chainloading GRUB2 from rEFInd:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove grub-efi and install grub-pc and gdisk.\n\n*Using gdisk, create a hybrid MBR (\"recovery and transformation options\" -> \"make hybrid mbr\"). When prompted to set the bootable flag of your Linux partition, select Y.\n\n*Install GRUB2 into the hybrid MBR: grub-install --force /dev/sdX\nNow reboot, and select \"Boot Linux (legacy) from whole disk volume\" in rEFInd.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 booting problems - no login screen I updated my Ubuntu Version to 14.10 and cannot boot anymore.

Install different greeter\nOccasionally, the default greeter (aka login screen ) won't work properly. I've encountered such issue with Fedora 20, where default gdm greeter would distort the login screen badly, and the persons on this post also said changing greeter (as suggested by myself) helped.\nTo change a greeter, access tty console (by pressing Ctrl+Alt +F*, where F* is any F1 - F6 key), login, and download a greeter that you would like to have. For instance,\nsudo apt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\nor sudo apt-get install lightdm-kde-greeter\nPersonally , I keep both of these on my machine.\nNext, you need to tell lightdm desktop manager which greeter to choose on boot. To do that, type \nsudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nNano is a command-line text editor, IMHO simplest to use. Most likely, this config file will be blank, so you would need to add the following lines:\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter\nwhere lightdm-gtk-greeter , would be the name of the greeter you installed. Bellow is the screen shot of my lightdm.conf file.\n\nFor more information on lightdm display manager configurations, you can read the following sources, as well as man page for lightdm (man lightdm):\nArch Wiki Lightdm\nUbuntu Help Lightdm\n2. Reinstall Unity desktop or install different desktop\nAmong other problems, it could be your desktop environment.\nTo reinstall Ubuntu's default desktop, do the following in tty:\napt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\napt-get install unity\n\nTo install a different desktop environment, you can refer to this post\nTo select different default desktop environment you can edit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf file. Again, you can do it using nano text editor.\nsudo nano /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf\n\nBellow is screen shot of my file:\n\nAgain, the name after = sign should be the name of the desktop environment you've installed, and it should boot by default.\n3. Possible graphics card driver issue.\nThis issue is somewhat beyond my level of knowledge right now, but I can point you to this post on Ubuntu Help page\nSmall note on nano text editor:\nNano's key's are all listed in the lower part of the screen. ^ is equal to Ctrl button and ^O for instance , refers to Ctrl+O, which is equivalent to \"Save file\". Ctrl+X (^X) is \"Exit with saving/ without saving\". \n\nA: I had just this problem post-upgrade to 14.10 from 14.04 and in my case I tracked this down to the fact that somehow during the upgrade my kernel headers and hence the source needed for my (Nvidia) graphics card driver to build had gone missing.  \nTo remedy this, I did the following:\n# install the linux-generic package to keep things in sync in the future (will take a while)\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n# then reinstall my nvidia drivers (found by looking for installed packaged in dpkg --list\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-304\n# finally, reboot\nsudo reboot\n\nIt should be noted that in my case installing linux-generic actually installed a new kernel and the reinstall of the driver then caused the relevant module to be built for that kernel (not the running one), but the reboot meant that it came up on the newer kernel in any case.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu/Windows on two separate hard drives I have just installed Ubuntu on a hard disk and windows 8.1 on another hard disk. How to make dual boot when pc starts ? As I have mentioned, they are not on different partitions, they are on different hard disks.\nThank you!\n\nA: Generally, to make dual-boot work out of the box, one needs to install windows first and then Ubuntu. Ubuntu's bootloader - GRUB2 then autodetects Windows and creates entry in the GRUB bootlist. \nIf you did the other way round, that is installed Ubuntu and then Windows, then you would need to repair the GRUB to be able to boot into both OSs. \nNow coming on to the next part, since you installed the OS on different HDDs altogether, you need to set the HDD with the GRUB bootloader as the first device to boot from in the BIOS. \nIf you have any issues figuring out the above, you may leave a comment and i will improve the answer.\n\nA: First disable UEFI in Windows because that will not allow you to enter into bios. Then after disabling, set the Linux HDD to boot first.

You computer will be using its full potential and will be much faster than the 32-bit one.\n\nA: If you have less than 4GB of RAM then it doesn't hurt to use 32-bit.  If you have 1GB or more however you really: should be using 64-bit.

UDP doesn't do any of this\n– a poorly-\"forced\" program might start sending gigabytes of data per\nsecond over UDP, regardless of link speed\n\n*TCP has retransmission, so if a packet is dropped in the middle (e.g.\nbecause the network is overloaded or has other problems) it will be\nresent. If the protocol depends on a reliable transport and you force\nit to go over UDP, the connection might die completely as soon as at\nleast a single packet gets lost. (And packets will get lost; see\npoints #1 and #2 above.)\n\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Centos, ubuntu, and windows I recently partitioned my hardrive to install ubuntu alongside windows. I then went to install centos over ubuntu. After this second installiation, even after specifying where centos should be installed i could not boot off windows. I then went back to install ubuntu off centos to try to recover the grub menu. Now even after installing ubuntu, i only have the option to boot centos which obviously doesnt work because it no longer exists. So now i cant boot anything. I know the windows partition still exists. I can only access the centos grub command line. I tried putting boot rescue on my usb using unetbootin but it failed for some reason.\nAnyideas? Thank you \n\nA: Hmm, looks like you may have to re-install GRUB. This should auto-detect any bootable partitions you have and allow you to boot from them.\nHere's how: http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd\n", "Q: Background only after first login on Ubuntu 14.04 install - is this expected or bad install? I am using an Windows 7 HP desktop. I just partitoned the hard drive to have a 8GB swap partition and a 128GB /ext4 mount point \"/\" partition. The installation went beautifully. I saw the dialog box that shows progress and talks about various Ubuntu features and also have some images. Then I was given a dialog saying it had finished and needed to restart. When I restart I got a login prompt. After logging in all I have is the orange Ubuntu desktop background and\nubuntu (r) 14.04 LTS \nat the lower left.\nIs it doing something the first time and the desktop will come up after some length of time, or was this a bad install?\nEDIT: Since asking this question I went to check on the computer and the screen is now black, with a cursor icon in the middle that is not responding to mouse movement and an underscore in the top left corner.\nEDIT2: I restarted and chose \"Additional Options\" and started with the Ubuntu choice that ends with (recovery mode). I ran the fsck option and two of the entries it printed out ended or were followed by \"FIXED\". I then restarted and got an Ubuntu session that I used successfully for an hour. I logged in and out successfully. But then the problem reappeared following later login attempts that don't use (recovery mode -> then continue normal boot). For non-recover-mode boots I can get to the login prompt every time. One time it froze at that point, but most of the time it freezes after accepting my password. The freeze will normally just display the background, but once it showed the launcher on the side as well. \nAfter booting via (recover-mode -> resume normal boot) this is what I see in System Settings->System->Software & Updates->Additional Drivers\n\n\nA: Try setting your start options to nomodeset, acpi=noapic, and other switches. Here's how: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132\nIf you're able to successfully boot into a normal session this way, the first thing to do is install drivers for your video card.

I want to ask about how oracle berkely db works with ubuntu servers with a crm application(using php), it is a open source oracle product or not...? can we setup this in our production servers.\nThank You.\nA.chandrasekhar\n\nA: The Oracle Berkeley DB is here. This says the documentation is under the open source license. Aha! The Open Source license also applies to the software too. \nStorage limits:  An individual DB database can store up to 256 terabytes of data. By using multiple databases, it is possible to use DB to store and manage petabytes of information. Within a single database, individual record keys or record data can be used to store up to 4 gigabytes of data. \nNOTE: This looks different than the Berkeley DB that comes with Perl, which has a limit of 1009 bytes for the length of data and key combined. \n", "Q: Help! WiFi problems with Ubuntu. (Full logs) Okay, here's the situation. I have a Broadcom Corporation BCM4321 802.11a/b/g/n (rev 05) WiFi card, and It really doesn't like my new router; It won't connect, the Wireless manager shows connection animation for a few minutes, then says disconnected. I am sure  the password is correct.  \nThis is a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04. I've had Ubuntu on this machine before (Installed using same disk), and with my old router WiFi worked fine. Now I have a new router- an Arris TG1672G modem. I currently am using a USB WiFi Dongle (Which is painfully slow) to use the internet. \nThis modem outputs two WiFi signals: Wireless_Vic, and Wireless_Vic-5G.

MATE 14.10 looks like the closest thing to Xubuntu, while being more robust and able to handle touch better.\nThe only thing is, I've relied on a hack for Xubuntu that allows it to have a wingpanel. I'd really like to have a similar setup with MATE, but I haven't been able to find a way to get it to work.\nSo, I'd like to know if either of these two options are viable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning the standard MATE panel into a wingpanel, essentially permanently floating over the window-header.

And voila! A wingpanel! \nTo do that back in the days of that link, you used gconf. However, now we use dconf. But in fact, I've found there's an even quicker way, just using the terminal: \ndconf write /org/mate/panel/toplevels/top/hide-delay 2147483647\n\nThat number represents the maximum time allowed for a delay... and it's ages, so works fine\n", "Q: Forcing time/date applet to show correct time Ubuntu: 14.04 x86_64, all latest updates applied.\nAfter recent time zone change, time/date applet continues to show \"old\" time.\ntzdata package is updated. ntpd is working. date shows correct time/date.

Then I downloaded Ubuntu on my computer and since then I always use it.\nBut recently I'm facing problems with space when I'm about to upgrade some packages.\nBut to deal with this I could simply do an autoclean command.

As a quick suggestion, instead of having 450GB in single partition, have that segregated into multiple partitions. So you can have different volumes for your work. With this, your operations become local to that particular volume and the other is not affected.\nFor backing up, you can use simple dd and create images.

I have multiple files in a directory over 200 which I would like to rename by removing all other characters including the character and the rest after it appears twice.\nExample:\nOne of the files in the directory is\nAkouo - Float-H6hQuio26Ww.mp3\n\nI would like a bash script which removes the second hyphen and all characters after it excluding the extension.\nThe end result should be\nAkouo - Float.mp3\n\n\nA: To rename your example \nAkouo - Float-H6hQuio26Ww.mp3\n\nto\nAkouo - Float.mp3\n\nuse\nrename 's/-[^-]*\\././' Akouo\\ -\\ Float-H6hQuio26Ww.mp3\n\nIf you want to rename all .mp3 files in your current directory with this schema, use\nrename 's/-[^-]*\\././' *-*-*.mp3\n\nYou can add option -n for a dry run.\n\nA: If we assume all files have two or more hypens and all files are mp3's, renaming (in python) would only take a few lines:\nhyps = [i for i in range(len(name)) if name[i] == \"-\"]\nname = name[:hyps[1]]+\"mp3\"\n\nHowever, in my opinion, a script should (without explicit information that it is not necessary) take at least into account the possibility that the directory has sub-directories and/or contains:\n\n\n*\n\n*hidden files\n\n*files with no extension\n\n*files with varying types of extensions\n\n*file names have only one, more then two or no hypens\n\n\nso that:\nfile1-2-3-4-5.txt\na-b-c-d-e\nAkouo - Float-H6hQuio26Ww.mp3\n\nbecomes:\nfile1-2.txt\na-b\nAkouo - Float.mp3\n\nThen the script is a bit more extensive:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport shutil\nimport os\n\nsourcedir = \"/path/to/files\"\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(sourcedir):\n    for name in files:\n        if name.startswith(\".\") or name.count(\"-\") < 2:\n            pass\n        else:\n            if name.count(\".\") == 0:\n                extension = \"\"\n            else:\n                extension = name[name.rfind(\".\"):]\n            hyps = [i for i in range(len(name)) if name[i] == \"-\"]\n            newname = name[:hyps[1]].strip()+extension\n            shutil.move(root+\"/\"+name, root+\"/\"+newname)\n\nCopy the script into an empty file, set the path to your directory and save it as rename.py.

This is role prevent crashes and keep stable and improve graphic performance if use latest version, especially for gaming 3D experience, watching HD or 3D movies, etc. I'm searching in internet, but I'm cannot find any solution at all in one-click solution. Like example:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Windows like example Driver Booster 2 from IObit: http://www.iobit.com/driver-booster.php\n\n*For Linux ???\n\n\nA: Unless you've installed drivers manually from third-party websites, all of your system drivers should be updated automatically by Ubuntu's built-in \"Software Updater\".  This is one of the great things about Ubuntu and other operating systems that use package management (Ubuntu uses the apt program for this).  Anything installed via apt, Ubuntu Software Center, or from a PPA should update automatically.  Everything that the Ubuntu installer put on your computer during installation of Ubuntu should also update automatically, including drivers.\nIf you've installed anything using the \"Additional Drivers\" utility, these should also update, although only if the third-party publisher (e.g. nVidia) updates them.  In some cases you may have to manually select a newer version using the same utility.\nSo if all you're worried about is keeping drivers up-to-date, then worry no more.  Unlike in Windows, Ubuntu keeps all your drivers up-to-date for you via the same utility that updates everything else.\nJust one quick note about Ubuntu's release schedule; most releases are only supported for 9 months after initial release.  However, in your case you have an LTS (Long Term Support) release, so yours will be supported for 5 years after initial release (until April 2019).  Once the 9 months or 5 years run out, the version becomes EOL (End of Life) and no longer receives updates. See this wiki page for release support information.\n", "Q: .desktop file with .bashrc environment I am using IntelliJ IDEA, and it uses some of the environment variables defined in the .bashrc script.\nIf I run its shell script from the terminal everything works fine but if I create a .desktop file to run it from the launcher then it is loaded without the .bashrc environment.\nI also tried using the \"Run with terminal\" option and it doesn't help. Is there a way to do those things?\nThe content of the desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=IntelliJ IDEA\nIcon=/home/gmarom/bin/idea-IU-135.1230/bin/idea.png\nExec=\"/home/gmarom/bin/idea-IU-135.1230/bin/idea.sh\" %f\nComment=Develop with pleasure!\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nTerminal=false\nStartupWMClass=jetbrains-idea\n\n\nA: Moving the environment variables to .profile didn't work for me.  Instead, I removed the code that @oliman suggests from my .bashrc and then I changed the my IntelliJ IDEA's launcher from this:\n\"/opt/idea-IU-163.12024.16/bin/idea.sh\" %f\n\nto this:\nbash -c \"source ~/.bashrc && /opt/idea-IU-163.12024.16/bin/idea.sh %f\"\n\n\nA: When running from a launcher, the idea.sh script is started using a non-iteractive shell. In your .bashrc make sure the environment variables are exported before\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n\nOr alternatively place the environment variable exports in ~/.bash_profile \n\nA: For me the fix was to move the environment variables from .bashrc to .profile and relogin. Komodo Edit now picks up the perlbrewed Perl from PATH.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables was very helpful.\n", "Q: Create temporary root password Is there a way to give the root user a temporary password? That is, after a certain time, or after it is manually deactivated, the password will be deleted.\nI want to give my colleague permission to access a server as root for a certain amount of time (like a day) so he can use ssh root@xxx.xx.xx.xx. After that, the password I give him will expire, and attempts to use it to log in will be rejected.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Try passwd -x 1. From man passwd:\n   -x, --maxdays MAX_DAYS\n       Set the maximum number of days a password remains valid. After\n       MAX_DAYS, the password is required to be changed.\n\nThis does not, of course, prevent your colleage from setting a password of their own choice, or using SSH keys to login.\nYou could also try usermod -e. From man usermod:\n   -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE\n       The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is\n       specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nAll of this is moot since you are giving the root password. The colleague can always undo whatever measure you put up.\nIt would be best if you give the user exactly as much privilege as they require, using sudo.\n", "Q: How can I view the total disk space taken up by all operating systems? I have a dual boot system with windows and Ubuntu (trusty). Now, when I am in Ubuntu, I can see the disk space I have, which is 25.7 GB. It also tells me that I have 1.8 GiB of  memory.Is this the amount of memory left in the disk? And how can I see the total disk space available on my hard drive that is the total space taken up by all the operating systems?\n(Note-When I boot my computer apart from Windows and Ubuntu there is also a section in the Grub menu that says:previous versions of linux, along with some complex version numbers. I don't know if this is naturally available or is a specific feature on my computer,since I was not around when my computer was first set up with Ubuntu.If more details are required about the Grub menu and it's options, then please tell me so via a comment )\n\nA: The entire disk space usages are visible irrespective of which OS you are using. Each OS provide disk utilities to provide the details.\nIf you are in Ubuntu - then you can use the common Unix commands - \ndf -h - To see all the mounted partitions.\nfdisk -l - To all the Disk partition on top of you HDD. \nyou can learn more about fdisk which is very powerful tool.\nRegarding the GRUB menu issue - The multiple Linux Kernel version will be displayed. Which is actually asking the user to pick which kernel version to use to boot the machine. By default grub use the latest version. If you uninstall old version then you won't see the extra entries on the grub.\n\nA: In Ubuntu there is a tool called Disc Usage (baobob). This tool neatly lines up your partitions and used space on each partition. This will also work for the Windows partition, after you have mounted it (easiest way to do this is to just open the folder of the partition).\nThe 1.8 GB of memory, is probably the amount of RAM you got.\nGrub has entries for your current linux kernel, previous linux kernels used, memtests and any other Operating Systems found, like Windows. So your setup would look like this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Current Linux OS and current newest kernel\n\n*Advanced options (which lists the previous kernels used by the system)\n\n*Any other Linux distros you might have installed\n\n*Windows Boot Loader partition (if Windows 7 or newer)\n\n*Your Windows\n\n\nThe Advanced version is for when your current kernel brakes your system in some way, you can boot a previous kernel from this option and make changed so the current kernel will work. This option is rarely used these days, because of the extensive kernel testing being done, before they are release, but it is still a good thing to have, just in case.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Android Studio if it was installed via Ubuntu Developer Tools Center (UDTC)? I installed Android Studio Beta on Xubuntu 14.10 by executing udtc android in a terminal. I want to uninstall it such that there are no traces on my machine of its prior existence.\nI chose ~/tools/android/android-studio/ as my installation path. If I installed Android Studio Beta by extracting the archive provided by Google, I'm confident that deleting only the tools directory would satisfy my requirement. But the udtc command also created the file ~/.local/share/applications/android-studio.desktop. I suspect that there are more such files outside of my installation path.\nWhat must I do to achieve the desired result?\n\nA: You can uninstall android studio by issuing\nudtc --remove android \n\nfrom your console. Be aware that it won't ask you for confirmation\n", "Q: replace newline with tab at a specific location I have a file like this.\nM00425_ght_cgd2_2212_B_0_2 (newline)\nATGCCGTTAGAGCTAG\nM00425_ght_cgd2_2213_B_0_3_1 (newline)\nGTACATTGACATAGAGTACATAGCGA\n\nI want a file like this:\nM00425_ght_cgd2_2212_B_0_2(tab)ATGCCGTTAGAGCTAG\nM00425_ght_cgd2_2213_B_0_3_1(tab)GTACATTGACATAGAGTACATAGCGA\n\nCan anybody help?\n\nA: Simple sed command:\nsed '$!N;s/\\n/\\t/' inputfile.txt > outputfile.txt\n\nWhich means join every pair of lines with a Tab delimiter.\nThis command joins two consecutive lines with the N command. They get joined with a \\n character between them. The substitute command replaces this newline with a tab, thus joining every pair of lines with a Tab delimiter.\nAlso that looks like this sed '/$/N;s/\\n/\\t/' inputfile.txt command.\nIF your file contains empty lines you can first delete all that lines by using below sed command:\nsed -i '/^$/d' inputfile.txt\n\n\nA: This is similar to Jacob's answer, but different enough that I thought it warranted mention.  Instead of searching for the presence of a string, you could check if the line contained characters other than \"GACT\".\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nwith open('input.txt','r') as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()\nfor i in range(0,len(lines)):\n    if len(lines[i].strip('GACT\\n'))>0:\n        lines[i] = lines[i].replace('\\n','\\t')\nwith open('output.txt','w') as f:\n    f.writelines(lines)\n\nIf your file does not meet the requirements of unique identifiers in the replacement lines, you can also make a different assumption.  The following assumes that for every odd numbered line you want to replace the newline with a tab, and for every even numbered line you do not.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nwith open('input.txt','r') as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()\nfor i in range(0,len(lines)):\n    if i/2==i/2.0:\n        lines[i] = lines[i].replace('\\n','\\t')\nwith open('output.txt','w') as f:\n    f.writelines(lines)\n\nYou could save these as, for example, lines2tabs.py then navigate to the directory in a terminal using cd and run it using python lines2tabs.py.  Note that you'll have to change input.txt to the name of your file.\n", "Q: Unable to install libfreetype6:i386 Ubuntu 14.10 64-Bit When trying to install some applications via Ubuntu software centre I am getting the error:\ncannot install libfreetype6:i386\n\nSo I tried to install it via terminal, and got this result:\nbfalcon@lappy:~$ sudo apt-get install libfreetype6:i386\nReading package lists...

/home/alvas/.pip/pip.log\n\nHow do I install scipy with pip3?\nIf there isn't any solution with pip3, how else can i install scipy for python3.x?\n\nA: It's telling you exactly what you need to do: install all those build dependencies.\nBefore I get there, I've said a few times before that I generally don't recommend people use pip (or pip3) to install packages into their global Python install. Both pip and apt-get are completely oblivious to each other. Files can be unduly overwritten or removed and because much of your operating system depends on your Python environment working, messing with it isn't a good idea.\nSo I would recommend either using a virtualenv (where you keep everything separate from the system) or only using repository-deployed packages.\nThat said, the technical reason you can't install is because SciPy needs to compile a load of stuff and it has external dependencies for a lot of that. These need to be fulfilled. You could do this manually (by reading the error) or in this case where there is a repo version, you could ask Apt to install the build dependencies:\nsudo apt-get build-dep python3-scipy\n\nAnd that will install a metric butt-load of packages. Note that some of these will probably be things you've already wedged in with pip. I'm seeing a lot of numpy stuff. Beware.\nAnd you'd still need to go through a similar process if you're building in a virtualenv but I would recommend against using apt to fulfil your dependencies because you'll probably have differing versions of dependencies. That's not a healthy build recipe.\nIn short, using the repo version is easiest.\nYou could also try\nsudo apt-get install python3-scipy\n\n", "Q: I think wrong Jack version Jack1 instead of Jack2 (Ubuntu14. Studio) I had lots of problems with my external firewire audio card in Ubuntu so I did fixed it with lots of help from my friends of Jack-ffado and jack-devel.\nBut now I try to install new software and if I try to do the configure then at the end it says: \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nlibjack-dev : Depends: libjack0 (= 1:0.121.3+20120418git75e3e20b-2.1ubuntu1) but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nThen I try to install libjack2-dev but I get: \nE: Unable to locate package libjack2-dev\n\nSo now I think I mixed up Jack1 and Jack2 if I am not mistaken Ubuntu 14 needs Jack2?\nHow can I fix this?\nMy info:\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu  \nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS  \nRelease:    14.04  \nCodename:   trusty\n\n\nA: The package you are looking for is libjack-jackd2-dev. Somehow you are trying to install (or have already installed) libjack-dev, which is based on code released two and a half years ago.\nThe following should get you going:\nsudo apt-get purge libjack-dev \nsudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev\n\n", "Q: I got an error while installing Ubuntu using windows installer I got this error, please help:\nAn error has occurred setting the element data.\nThe request is not supported.\n\n\nA: Open disk management in Windows and check to see if the partition type for Windows is set to dynamic, if it is than you need to change it to basic but that requires you to delete your partitions if I remember correctly.\nIf you're planning on fully switching over to Linux what you can do is put it onto a DVD or USB and install it from there, it should give you the option to uninstall Windows. What is good about this is that it'll make Ubuntu run faster than installing it from inside Windows.\nIf you're just planning on trying it out to see if you like it you can always just preview it and not actually install it (again, from a DVD/USB stick). I hope this has helped you a bit. -Coldy\n", "Q: No internet connection on install [14.04] I decided to install ubuntu as my 2nd OS (Together with Windows 8 x64 non-UEFI), made an USB drive with installer of Ubuntu 14.04. But when loading is done, ubuntu installer asked me to connect to WiFi (I am already have wired connection), if I press NO, I CAN check \"install updates\" but after 3-5 seconds it says that I have no internet connection, if yes, nothing happens! \"Hmm.. ok\". When I press continue, nothing happens, just a spinning cursor.\nBut if I press EXIT, I can open firefox and everything is ok with the internet. If I open installer again, it still think that I have no Internet but now I can install Ubuntu (at the middle of installation it even loads something from the internet!).\nCan anybody say to me wtf is that?\nPS: I tried cd, usb, another image (14.10 instead of 14.04 and 14.04.1), another burner (pendrivelinux, unetbootin, rufus, ultraiso) but everytime I have the same problem.\n\nA: While I have never seen behavior such as you describe, I find myself asking\nif it's possible that the wireless card is recognized and configured. When I did my install, I had no wifi access, but soon discovered that my card was not set up. Broadcom wireless cards require some special effort. Searching for 'Broadcom wifi' will get info that is needed for driver installation. There are several steps required, but the information I found provided great detail and I was able to do this driver install 2 times (upgraded from 12.10 to 14.04 LTS).  Hope this helps  Craig \n", "Q: PostgreSQL start.conf not working I've just upgraded to 14.10 from 14.04. I have both 9.3 and 9.4 versions of PostgreSQL installed but, for now and until i fully migrate to 9.4, i just want to start the 9.3 cluster. \nI edited the start.conf file for the 9.4 cluster and changed the auto setting to manual but, when i do \n\nservice postgresql start\n\nboth clusters start normally.\nAm i doing something wrong? Am i missing something? Is this a bug?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I had same problem.\nFollowing command helped me to stop 9.4 service.\npg_ctlcluster 9.4 main stop\n\nAfter this command when I run\nservice postgresql stop\nservice postgresql start\nservice postgresql status\n\nI have following output\n9.3/main (port 5432): online\n9.4/main (port 5434): down\n\n", "Q: How to update wireshark interface list? I installed Wireshark(v1.10.6) from software centre. In the interface list, only bluetooth is shown. I wanted to capture packets that are sent & received from wireless connection.\nHow should I do it? Is there any way to add wireless and wired connections into this list?\n\nA: Usually you can't capture network interfaces as normal user, you need administrative rights to access the network layer.\nYou can try running wireshark as \"root\" and check if the interfaces are shown.\nP.S.: You should use the root account only for testing purpose. Pay attention to the messagebox that will show up when you run wireshark as root.\n\nA: Try quitting Wireshark, doing\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common\n\nfrom the command line, and restarting Wireshark.  That should give you permission to access \"normal\" network adapters without having to run Wireshark as root, which, as sinclair notes, you really don't want to do - to quote the doc/README.packaging file in the Wireshark source:\nWIRESHARK CONTAINS OVER TWO MILLION LINES OF SOURCE CODE.

After installing Ubuntu 14.10 I tried to change cursor theme with Unity-tweak-tool. Think there was a big shadow so I tried to chose another theme. It does not change. Now I think it was Glass theme. I tried to change theme back to DMZ-White, did update-alternatives, checked system files, rebooted for many times and did compiz-replace. Nothing helped.I have purged xcursor-themes and did all things above again and now I see standard little black cursor but not DMZ one.\n\nA: I found a solution.\nI was making experiments with KDE before. And after reinstalling 14.10 I didn't remove /home/user/.icons directory because I had some icons there. But KDE made 'default' directory in .icons and there was 'index.theme' file with KDE cursor settings. Deleting the 'default' directory helped me.\n", "Q: apt-get working with organization network but now with home network (Ubuntu guest Virtual Box) I am using cntlm to get apt-get working. This works fine when I am connected to my organization's network but I am unable to get this working with my home network.

How can I recover from this, I cannot even use sudo now.\n\nA: As you can't use sudo, try the following command instead (you'll get root privileges with pkexec):\npkexec chmod 755 /\n\nTested ok in a VM:\nu@u-VirtualBox:/$ sudo chmod 3 /\n[sudo] password for u: \nu@u-VirtualBox:/$ ll\nls: cannot open directory .: Permission denied\nu@u-VirtualBox:/$ sudo chmod 755 /\nsudo: unable to stat /etc/sudoers: No such file or directory\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\nsudo: unable to initialize policy plugin\nu@u-VirtualBox:/$ pkexec chmod 755 /\n==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.policykit.exec ===\nAuthentication is needed to run `/bin/chmod' as the super user\nAuthenticating as: u,,, (u)\nPassword: \n==== AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE ===\nu@u-VirtualBox:/$ ll\ntotal 104\ndrwxr-xr-x  23 root root  4096 oct.  12 20:22 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x  23 root root  4096 oct.  12 20:22 ../\n[...]\nu@u-VirtualBox:/$ \n\n\nA: First, try other suggestions while still logged in, because mine requires a reboot. If you see that no other attempt works, you should reboot and start a live DVD/USB session. \nMount the root partition and edit the /etc/fstab as root. You will need to run a command similar to this:\ngksu gedit /media/ubuntu/sda1/etc/fstab\n\nPlease adjust the path to the correct mount point you used.\nIn the file, locate the line belonging to the root partition, it should look similar to the following:\nUUID=[...] /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nTry to enforce \"universal\" permissions by adding the proper parameter:\nUUID=[...] /               ext4    umask=000,errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nReboot and try to log in again. You should be able to fix the permissions with:\nsudo chmod 755 /\n\nWarning\nAfter the fix, remember to revert the changes made to /etc/fstab, otherwise anyone will be able to access and modify every system file.\n\nA: I also did this almost exactly. The way I solved it was I first restarted my device, went to advanced options, and launched recovery mode. This gives you a root shell to work with. In the root shell, you can use chmod 755 / (the default) and it will go back to normal. It works because root can read, write, or execute anything regardless of permissions.\n", "Q: davfs - SSL handshake failed: SSL error: sslv3 alert handshake failure I'm trying to mount a remote WebDAV (OwnCloud) using https on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine.\nI run this command and it prompts me for a username and password\nsudo mount -t davfs -o uid=ne,gid=users https://example/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/ /mount/remote\nI then get the error\n\n/sbin/mount.davfs: Mounting failed.\n  SSL handshake failed: SSL error: sslv3 alert handshake failure\n\nOther machines (including Android) are able to connect to the WebDAVS correctly.\nHow can I prevent this error?

I have installed Foobar2000 in Wine and it has no access to the CD.\n\n\nIn Wine configuration I added the cd drive. \n\n\nBut it doesn't work.\n\nExcepting in one situation: if inserting a dvd and then replacing the dvd with the audio cd without unmounting first, the audio cd will be then seen foobar2000, while in Thunar file manager and on the desktop the audio is displayed twice.\n\n\n\nThis stands as a workaround for now.\n\nI am curious:\n\n\n*\n\n*why cdda://sr0/ is not a good mounting point to be set in Wine configs?\n\n*while media/cdrom can be set and works for dvds - why doesn't it work for audio cds?\nBut to those I have an answer here:\nAudio CDs are a bit different - there's no actual filesystem there and as such they can't be mounted. \n\nI remember I already did this in the past trying to confirm that Foobar2000 works in Wine: I was able to rip cds then! without the dvd mounting trick.\n\nAn answer below says that the workaround (described above and also posted by me as an answer) is a Thunar bug that makes the cd accessible by (giving the impression of) mounting it first. \nBut if a bug can do it, there should be a 'proper' way to do it. (Not trying to mount the cd if that is impossible, but making it accessible otherwise.)\n\nEven if audio cds cannot be mounted, they are still accessible in Ubuntu players without being mounted: how to achive this in Foobar2000? \n\nEDIT: Considering the bug that made me happy, it has nothing to do with Thunar: it was already posted on launchpad: Disks are not unmounted when physical eject button is used. Also, related here. Found about it in this discussion here.\n\nA: Why is cdda://sr0/ not a good mounting point to be set in Wine configs?\n\nCDDA is not a filesystem. It's a specific protocol for reading and writing data to/from CD drives. Think of CDDA like an http:// for CD drives. You can't use HTTP for Wine because it's not a local part of a file system. CDDA, likewise, isn't part of your local filesystem. Both are protocols for getting data from remote sources.\nWINE is a compatibility layer. It can not and will not be able to directly interface with everything that Linux offers. It can interface with some things, but drives are problematic. You need to add the drive to the Wine config so it knows where to look. This is why Wine can't see /dev/sdc unless you tell it to. And, you cannot mount CD drives, so.... You might be able to request Wine's developers to add Audio CD support. Maybe you'll get it. That will make everyone happy.\nSee below for more information about this.\n\nwhile media/cdrom can be set and works for dvds - why doesn't it work for audio cds?\n\nAudio CDs do not have a real filesystem. Audio CDs are only storage containers for WAV-type media files and metadata files.  The CD reader can read the audio from the CD and then expose it to the computer in CDDA format.\nDVDs, on the other hand, do contain a filesystem called UDF. This requires that they be mounted in something like /media/cdrom.\nWhen you do the CD/DVD swap trick, you force Linux to see it as a data disc containing CDDA files. In reality, these CDDA files are not really files. They are instead tracks containing raw music. The system \"contains\" them in CDDA files so it can use them for programs like Rhythmbox, VLC, and any other media player / CD ripper. You usually do not see this because there is no reason for you to do so. You cannot rename the files to WAV format and have them play.\nThe links you gave in your answer explain most of the above. GVFS does all the ugly \"filesystem\" work. This answer explains everything I didn't here.\n\nGVFS doesn't mount the CD. It only reads the CD. Nobody and nothing can mount CDs. Not even Jon Skeet can mount CDs. Give up and go home. If you successfully mount a CD drive, you will undermine the fabric of space-time and cause T̞̱͙̣͔̥̘o̝̞̣n̷̲͔̖̠̤ỵ͚̺͔̟͖ ̠͎̘̲̩͎ͅt͝h̡̯͙̺̣̣̝e ͞P҉̼̳̥̬o̪̣ṇ͈̯̣̫͎ͅy to eat StackExchange and destroy the knowledge of the world that man has. NEVeR Even T`ry!\n\nRead above paragraph as a large no.\n\nUpdated Answer:\n\nIf you were able to see it in the past without having to do \"DVD tricks\", I would recommend reporting a bug against Wine and possibly GVFS.\nIn answer to your comments:\n\n*\n\n*Read first section: Wine is a compatibility layer. It cannot interface with everything the system has.\n\n*If it did it in the past, chances are that support was (accidentally) removed in Wine or GVFS. Report a bug for this.\n\n*There is no proper workaround because Wine does not interface with CDDA directly. When GVFS exposes the CDDA protocol to the system, it's up to Wine to decide how to expose it to the the windows programs. It seems as though Wine cannot expose it properly. Report a bug to Wine. You might (no guarantee) be able to mount it directly by using this: mount /dev/sr0 /mnt. Then, point /mnt to Wine. It's doubtful that it will work, but it might.\n\nYou cannot directly have Foobar2000 integrate with your CD directly, at least not now.\nAlso, you should read this and this. They say that the below is a possible workaround:\nBasically, create a folder in / called cdrom. Assign permissions:\nchmod go+rx /cdrom\nchown root:cdrom /cdrom\n\nAdd yourself to the group cdrom:\nusermod -a -G cdrom cip\n\nAdd to /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sr0 /cdrom\n\nYou may or may not need to add this as a CD mountpoint in WINE. Try both ways.\n\nMy less than answer opinion\n\nDo not take this as part of the answer. This is just a long comment that is better placed in my answer.\n\n*\n\n*It's not a workaround for a bug in Thunar. It is a bug in Thunar GVFS. See Sergey's answer for why this is. It's caused by Thunar not knowing the difference between the two GVFS drives.\n\n\n*Why do you even need Foobar2000? IIUC, it's just a media player. What's wrong with Banshee, Rhythmbox, or VLC?\n\n\n*You should read stuff on GVFS and CDDA. It'll help you in truly mastering this topic. This answer is pretty basic.\nFormatting inspired by this\n\nA: This might be due to permission issue. please check whether the  Foobar2000 is having enough permission to list the cd drive. Try changing to demon process under root user and check\n\nA: I will re-post as a workaround what I found and posted in the question.\nI read on various pages that the audio cd cannot be mounted, also here, that it should not be, or that there is no need to mount it - also here.\nAnyway, Foobar2000 for whatever reason cannot see the normal way when an audio-cd is inserted.\nThere is this weird  workaround that by a sort of bug in Thunar can make the audio cd be seen as a dvd and mounted. \n\n\n*\n\n*Insert a dvd movie in the cdrom drive, wait for it to mount or mount it.\n\n*Open Foobar2000, open cd\n\n*Without unmounting the dvd, replace it with the audio cd.\n\n*'Open' the cd.\n\nRip will work too.\n\n\nBut while this is done through what appears to be a bug that makes the cd accessible as if it were a dvd, the real answer should be how to access the cdrom in foobar2000 in the way the native applications do (if cds are never mounted, then, without mounting them!)\nI hope nobody fixes this bug before I find an alternative solution. :(\n", "Q: samba upgrade on ubuntu good day , my name is saleem ali from trinidad and tobago . i would like some assistance - i have a server running samba along with squid but i would like to create a new server to run samba alone the other system is old and i want to upgrade it . the new server has ubuntu 14 lts and i would like to now what is the easiest way to migrate from the old server to the new server.\nalso i have a backup script running that backup the  complete etc file on an external if that would be of any help >>> thanking you in advance\n\nA: *\n\n*Announce downtime to your users\n\n*stop samba on old server\n\n*copy data to new server\n\n*copy samba config to new server\n\n*start samba on new server and look at the logfiles\n\n\nIf everything is OK, announce the move to your users, if not, open an new question with the specific error message(s).\n", "Q: converting pdf to text using pdftotext Is there any way by which i can find position of text selecting cursor in ubuntu 12.04?Can we use pdftotext to convert pdffile to text depending on those coordinates.\n\nA: pdftotext -layout input.pdf output.txt\n\npdftotext screws up the output use pdfBox (java) .\n(OR)\nIf you have a Google account, you can use Google Docs to upload the PDF and transform it into editable text\n", "Q: Texlive 2014 in Ubuntu14.04 Okay,\nSo I have 14.04 with texlive installed by default.

I had read a little about Ubuntu in school and was excited to try it out, but I soon found that my previous knowledge was highly wanting. \nAt first I had no problems, but when I tried installing an antivirus, I found that debian packages could not be opened/installed/used without some sort of graphical package management program like Synaptic or Gdebi. So I installed Synaptic first, which refused to recognize the file name of the antivirus file package, and then Gdebi, which found the file ok but said that \"dependency not satisfied: libicu42\". So I went ahead and installed that as well, but still it showed the same problem.\nAfter all this I decided to listen to the Update Manager and upgrade to 14.04, hoping that such problems as I was facing would be automatically resolved in the latest version. That's when my problems really started. \nAs I said, I have never used Ubuntu before, so I don't know if this is a regular thing or not.The upgradation was in six steps, out of which, installing till the third step took 12 hours straight. Twelve Hours Straight. And then in the middle of \"Installing Updates\", specifically, \"Preparing gnome calculator\", it just froze. The dialog box turned gray, and it just stopped working. I left it like that for about 45 minutes, but it showed no change and the screen dulled. When I moved the pointer to activate the screen, it gave me a dialog box with those tiny rectangles instead of characters and the picture of a red start button. I closed it once but nothing changed so I decide to take a chance and the next time it appeared, I clicked on the recommended red coloured option button choice. It restarted the laptop, but then the black terminal-type screen appeared and started giving out a repeated message that terminated in \"will now halt\" and just shut everything down. Ever since then, whenever I push the power button, it shows the black Dell logo screen, the purple Ubuntu logo screen and then dulls down. Nothing happens unless I push the power button again, when the same error message screen appears. It is really frustrating since the laptop is brand new, and I can literally do nothing on it.

I did this by pressing shutting down and turning Power button + shift and leaving shift key pressed until I got the ubuntu factory restore menu.\nHope this helps!!.. I'll try updating to ubuntu 14.04 again later today.\nGood luck in all!\n\nA: Double clicking your .deb package should have opened it with the Ubuntu Software Center and isntalled it.  Although in general it is a better idea to only install software from the official repositories.  Also, in many cases an anti-virus program on linux is not needed as discussed here.\nUpgrading from one major release to another typically requires several gigabytes of updates.  For example, when I upgraded from 14.04 to 14.10 I had to download 2.3GB.  This could explain the 12 hours if you have a slow internet connection.\nI've outlines several options below, but if I were you I would do a fresh install of 14.04 (I wouldn't recommend 14.10 yet as it just came out a few days ago).\nRe-install 14.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable USB drive or DVD on a computer running:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Windows\n\n*Mac\n\n\n*Plug in the USB, start your computer, and boot from the Live Media.\n\n*Choose \"Try Ubuntu\" when booting from the Live Media.\n\n*Backup any files you care about (e.g. to an external hard drive).\n\n*Install Ubuntu using the Live Media.\n\n\nReset to Factory defaults\nIf you run into driver problems such as the touchpad or audio not working, you might need Dell's version of Ubuntu.

How should I do it?\nedit: does it matter if I create them at the end of directory or at the beginning? (order of partitions)\n\nA: The small ntfs partition is a Windows system partition.

You do not need to get all the partitions fully correct, just the Windows (NTFS). Make sure that you fully partition the drive (you should not leave any free space on the drive).

Windows will most likely want a primary partition as well when it is installing.\n\n*Apply the partitions to the drive.\n\n*Cancel the Ubuntu installer\n\n*Install Windows into the NTFS partition, do not change partitions using the Windows installer.

Core 2 is frequently showing 100% usage in htop. Meanwhile Core 1,3,4 show something around 5% most of the time. \nIs this normal? Is there a way to better distribute Core 2's load to the other cores and is that even desireable? \n\nA: Yeah, it can be normal. Depends on how much management the OS does. The two big tools to impact this are\n\n\n*\n\n*taskset which can direct what CPU a process can use\n\n*setting the IRQ affinity of your pci devices\n\n\nIRQ affinity is easy to fix. Do some IO, watch /proc/interrupts and if you see MSI-foo all on the same CPU then distribute them. You usually want to service IRQs on the \"real cores\" since they are the fastest. Once you have that figured out, write a script to commit that to system start and you're done.\nProcesses are a pain because they can migrate between CPUs. To \"do it right\" you really need to setup cgroups for the processes in question. Or... you take the lazy way out and make a wrapper script for program X that calls taskset ... _X.\nMeasure your before an after performance with a benchmark like fio or all your tweaking is for nothing. If you can't measure your changes you don't know what they're worth.\nFor example I have a 24 CPU, 2  numa node system here that has a storage device which will create a MSI interrupt for each CPU... and then bind them all to CPU 0 :-p. Spreading the IRQ affinity across the first 12 cores quadrupled the IO throughput recorded by fio. But this system actually has lots of bandwidth, the typical desktop does not.\nGood luck. Performance work is fun, ... and hard :)\n", "Q: Calendar translation/internationalization Can anyone tell me why on earth is the calendar internationalized/translated into the the \"Location's\" target language while the system is English and no other languages were installed? E.g.: Cluj-Napoca → Romanian (the names of the months and starting letters of the days)\nIs there any solution to keep the location and change the names and letters to the system language? I would really prefer the English version.\n\nA: The explanation is that calendar applications typically fetch the weekday and month names from the selected Regional Formats locale. One way is to change that setting to one of the English options, but it will change various kinds of format settings all over the system.\nAnother way is to edit your ~/.profile file and add this line:\nexport LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8\n\nEven if that too will change the date and time format all over the place, it will keep things like number and currency formats in accordance with your setting in Language Support.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on a ThinkPad A30 I just installed the latest version of Ubuntu on my old ThinkPad A30.

If you want to see a less detailed version of the output, do sudo fdisk -l | grep 'Disk /' instead.\nBut to answer your question, if you want to determine which disk the system booted on, you can do this:\nmount | grep -E '(/|/boot) ' | awk '{print $1,$2,$3}'\n\nThis lists all mounted partitions (mount), looks for the boot and/or root partitions (grep -E '(/|/boot) '), then filters the output to only show the disk and partition number and the mount point it is mounted on (awk '{print $1,$2,$3}').

That means /dev/sda is the disk that the system booted from.\n\nA: This might not be the most accurate way to do this but a really quick easy way is to grep for the mount point that ends with / (a slash) from the output of df -h.\nSo that would be: df -h | grep '/$' \nAlternatively, If you wanted just the device name you could:\ndf -h | grep '/$' | sed 's/\\(^\\/dev\\/\\w*\\).*/\\1/'\n", "Q: Troubleshooting audio for Acer Aspire E 17 (E5-771G-7868) My system is Lubuntu 14.04.1 AMD64 Desktop:\n$ uname -a\nLinux polyphemus 3.13.0-37-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 22 21:28:38 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\nSound is not playing:\n$ speaker-test\n\nspeaker-test 1.0.27.2\n\nPlayback device is default\nStream parameters are 48000Hz, S16_LE, 1 channels\nUsing 16 octaves of pink noise\nALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:1022:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave\nPlayback open error: -2,No such file or directory\n\nThese are my devices:\n$ lspci -nn | grep -i audio\n00:03.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT HD Audio Controller [8086:0a0c] (rev 0b)\n00:1b.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP HD Audio Controller [8086:9c20] (rev 04)\n\nThe modules are loaded:\n$ lsmod | grep snd\nsnd_seq_midi           13324  0 \nsnd_seq_midi_event     14899  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq                61560  2 snd_seq_midi_event,snd_seq_midi\nsnd_rawmidi            30144  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq_device         14497  3 snd_seq,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq_midi\nsnd_hda_codec_hdmi     46368  1 \nsnd_hda_codec_realtek    65580  1 \nsnd_hda_intel          56451  1 \nsnd_hda_codec         192906  3 snd_hda_codec_realtek,snd_hda_codec_hdmi,snd_hda_intel\nsnd_hwdep              13602  1 snd_hda_codec\nsnd_pcm               102099  3 snd_hda_codec_hdmi,snd_hda_codec,snd_hda_intel\nsnd_page_alloc         18710  2 snd_pcm,snd_hda_intel\nsnd_timer              29482  2 snd_pcm,snd_seq\nsnd                    69322  13 snd_hda_codec_realtek,snd_hwdep,snd_timer,snd_hda_codec_hdmi,snd_pcm,snd_seq,snd_rawmidi,snd_hda_codec,snd_hda_intel,snd_seq_device,snd_seq_midi\nsoundcore              12680  1 snd\n\nWhat else could I do to troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: The problem is that the default soundcard is HDMI device, not main soundcard .\nA way to change sound devices order at a low level (alsa) is to add this 2 lines at the end of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf :  \noptions snd-hda-intel index=0 model=auto vid=8086 pid=9c20\noptions snd-hda-intel index=1 model=auto vid=8086 pid=0a0c\nthen reboot.\n(the \"vid\" and \"pid\" value is from your  lspci command)\nYou could find other way like using pavucontrol (pulseaudio volume control)  to change default output device for Pulseaudio: clic green buton near second device in \"output device tab\", not sure it will works for speaker-test .\n", "Q: How to copy and paste files with CLI and have a status I am trying to copy large amounts of data using SSH so all I have is the CLI.

The minecraft hosts are also running ubuntu, either 12.04 or 14.04, and the OVH has ubuntu on it. Currently I've tried doing this:\nsysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport port -j DNAT --to-destination ip:port\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE\n\nThis mostly works fine, with the exception of the obvious, that all the clients have the same IP as the server i've done this on. Is there any way i can set any of these devices up so that it preserves the original source IP? I've read that tcpproxy (http://www.quietsche-entchen.de/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/proxies/TcpProxy) is a good solution to this, but i see no reason this problem would not continue.\nI also wonder if using this would cause replies from the minecraft server to bypass the proxy, leaking the real IP's, which i would like to avoid. \n\nA: Preserving the IP address of the proxied server wouldn't work in your situation. If the client originally connects to the proxy (we'll say proxy:1111) and gets a response from minecraft1:2525, what does the client do with it. There's no way for the client to map this response to the original request.\nKeep doing it the way you're doing it.\nInstead, you could use multiple rule sets on a range of ports. So, for example, minecraft1 is proxy:1111, minecraft2 is proxy:1112, mincraft3 is proxy:1113, etc.\nThen you could set up your rules like this:\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 1111 -j DNAT --to-destination ip:port\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 1112 -j DNAT --to-destination ip:port\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 1113 -j DNAT --to-destination ip:port\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE\n\nThen, to connect to minecraft1, you'd use proxy:1111. For minecraft2, proxy:1112, etc. The port that the actual Minecraft servers are running on doesn't matter since the rules will relay to the correct port.\n", "Q: how to copy files on a differnt ubuntu machine on network to local ubuntu machine I am trying to copy files from a ubuntu machine(with IP 10.46.57.44) on to current directory on my ubuntu VMware player using following command but the command doesnt look right?\ncan anyone suggest what is the right command?\nscp username@10.46.57.44:/local/mnt/workspace/kernel_db/new/linux-headers-3.10.0+_3.10.0+-10.00.Custom_i386.deb\n\n\nA: If you type scp you will see this:\nusage: scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]\n           [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]\n           [[user@]host1:]file1 ...

Thus, I started setting up a local installation of Python 2.6 (local so I didn't disturb the original distribution and to work without su, as my system administrator). That requires some packages, I was tried to add PIP, which required activating zlib in order to run get-pip.py (as per the instructions).\nThus: As per the top response in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12344970/building-python-from-source-with-zlib-support I changed the stated line of code.

I was wondering how to go about changing which user it selects to run the authentication?\nFor instance, if I want to install software from the Ubuntu Software Center I am asked to authenticate with user X and I would like to change that to be user Y globally.\nI am also aware that I can just run things with sudo from the command line, but I don't want to have to do that.\nI'm using ubuntu 14.04. And user Y is in the sudoers file and as of now user X is not.\n\nA: TL;DR: Adding the user to the sudo group with sudo usermod -aG sudo username solves this problem because both sudo and Polkit use that group.\nThe usual and expected way to give a user administrative powers on an Ubuntu system is to add the user's account to the sudo group. This gives them powers not just through sudo but through Polkit as well. The graphical prompt that lets you select between users with administrative powers is a Polkit prompt, not a sudo prompt. As muru says, most graphical programs that prompt you to enter a password to perform an administrative task are using Polkit, not sudo.\nBut to make a user an administrator, to allow them to perform actions as root with sudo and Polkit and so that they will appear in the list of users to authenticate as when using Polkit, you do not need to configure sudo and Polkit separately and I recommend against doing so. Just put the user in the sudo group. Don't be fooled by the name--Polkit respects this group just as sudo does.\n\nThe wording of your question very strongly suggests that, rather than adding the user to the Polkit group, you had added a custom entry for that one specific user in /etc/sudoers:\n\n...it just specifies it as the user that set up my machine.\n\nThe user created when you install Ubuntu is added to the sudo group.\nAnd you mentioned (emphasis mine):\n\nAnd user Y is in the sudoers file and as of now user X is not.\n\nPolkit does not use /etc/sudoers so giving a user the ability to run sudo by editing that file does not give them abilities through Polkit. That's a possible reason you might actually want to edit that file--if you wanted to give a user powers through sudo but not Polkit. However, you want both, and  that's what the sudo group in Ubuntu is configured for already, so you should just use that.\nSince you do have the ability to run commands as root with the sudo command, you can add username (replace it with the actual username, of course) to the sudo group by running:\nsudo usermod -aG sudo username\nOr if you want to use Polkit to add it, you can run this command, which has the exact same effect once it completes:\npkexec usermod -aG sudo username\nAfter you run either of those commands, username will be able to perform arbitrary actions as root through both sudo and Polkit. Note that usermod needs the -a flag, as shown, or it will remove the user from other groups, which you do not want.\nSee also How to add existing user to an existing group?\n\nIn case you're interested in how both sudo and Polkit are set up to grant rights to users in the sudo group, the answer can be gleaned from their configuration files. By default, /etc/sudoers includes these lines:\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n/etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/51-ubuntu-admin.conf consists of:\n[Configuration]\nAdminIdentities=unix-group:sudo;unix-group:admin\n\nThus both sudo and Polkit are configured to confer administrative privileges to users who are in either or both of the admin and sudo groups. The admin group is listed for compatibility with old versions of Ubuntu where admin was used instead of sudo, in case you upgrade from such a version and have user accounts in admin but not sudo. But aside from that situation, you likely don't even have an admin group. Running getent group admin sudo will show which of those groups exists and which users are in them. On a freshly installed 14.04 system, it won't show anything for admin. So use the sudo group, not the admin group, to make users administrators.\nThese configuration details are true of Ubuntu 14.04, as you were running when you asked this question, but also of all subsequent releases as of this writing, up to and including Ubuntu 17.10. Adding a user to the sudo group is the fully effective and most appropriate way to give them full sudo and Polkit powers, on all currently supported Ubuntu releases.\n\nI'd like to acknowledge Videonauth both for the useful comment on another answer (that has since been deleted) that led to my writing this answer and for verifying that the information I've given about the contents of sudoers and 51-ubuntu-admin.conf is still accurate as of Ubuntu 17.10.\n\nA: There is no such thing as default user for authentication.\nIts just that by default, the user created during installation of Ubuntu(in your case, X) is an administrator i.e., it is attached to the sudo group. So when you are performing elevated tasks like installation of softwares, you are asked for the password of the user in the sudo group.\nNow when you add a new user Y, its by default a standard user and has to be manually added to sudo group or in general terms, made an administrator to install applications. Once the user is added to sudo group, you would be asked for the password of user Y when performing elevated tasks (when logged in as Y obviously).\n\nA: For sometime now, sudoers has not been the only way to control user privileges on Ubuntu and other Linux distros. Polkit allows more fine-grained control of privileges. When you use GParted or Synaptic on a recent version of Ubuntu, authentication is usually done using polkit.\nTo set an user (say Y) as an administrator for polkit, create a file in /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/ (say 99-custom.conf), containing:\n[Configuration]\nAdminIdentities=unix-user:Y\n\nYou can test whether this was applied correctly by using pkexec as Y:\n$ pkexec bash -l\n==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.policykit.exec ===\nAuthentication is needed to run `/bin/bash' as the super user\nAuthenticating as: muru,,, (muru)\nPassword: \n==== AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE ===\n\nSince you already have an admin user, you will be offered a choice by pkexec:\n$ pkexec bash\n==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.policykit.exec ===\nAuthentication is needed to run `/bin/bash' as the super user\nMultiple identities can be used for authentication:\n 1.  X,,, (Y)\n 2.  Y,,, (X)\nChoose identity to authenticate as (1-2): \n\nThe GUI should offer a drop-down list.\n", "Q: What does a \"Resource temporarily unavailable\" error mounting a filesystem mean?

You also appear to be dual booting Windows. If fast-start is enabled under Windows (the default) the file system is unavailable due to the hibernation file Windows leaves there. This is actually for your protection. If you were to make changes to the file system with Ubuntu while Windows is in hibernation status (fast-boot), you would lose those changes upon rebooting (resuming) Windows.\nThe first thing to try is disabling fast-boot from windows. This should allow you to mount the drive with Ubuntu.\nI recommend replacement of the drive ASAP and insuring that you have current backups of all your critical data.\nSource: Experience\n", "Q: ACL permission defaults are not applying to new files I am trying to set up ACL's so that all new sub-directories and files withing a directory automatically inherit it's parents permissions.

I listen to podcasts in the background, but also use tools like mumble for staying in touch with my gaming group (steamlug). After recently updating to 14.04 from 12.04 this behaviour started:\nWhenever someone talks on mumble, totem and Minecraft volumes adjust to 51%. I haven’t loaded the ducking module, and it doesn’t appear to be in the list either. I know there are roles in pulse to control this, but I cannot find which module is doing this.\nWhen I spotted module-intended-roles in the pactl list I unloaded it, but it doesn’t seem to have made a difference.\nThought maybe module-filter-apply was doing it, unloaded that too, no change.\n\nA: I did a little source diving in Mumble when I had an volume attenuation problem as well. Your problem resides with Mumble, not with PulseAudio. Mumble has a setting in Configure->Settings->(click the Advanced checkbox)->Audio Output. There's a slider that says \"Attenuate applications by...\" with two checkboxes underneath. Uncheck them both in order to disable the attentuation.\nMumble uses the PulseAudio API to manually adjust the volume levels of all applications except itself to do the attenuation. I found this particularly annoying since Mumble attenuates all applications regardless of where they're actually outputting to. For example, if I was watching a movie over HDMI (different output) and using Mumble for some reason, any time somebody talked the movie volume would go down. There was no way around this but to write a patch ;). I have a pull request at the Mumble Git that avoids attenuation if the audio output is not the same output that Mumble is using.\n", "Q: Brother network printer with users My office has a Brother MFC-9970 CDW on the network.

The instructions said TOR is now installed and running.\nThe problem is I cannot find or run the TOR Browser on the system.

Everything seems to work right in python 2.7.

Having python(3) versions in /usr/local only makes sense if you need different versions from the ones that you can get using apt-get or if you really need a version compiled differently.\nYou can easily get python3.2 from the Ubuntu repositories on 12.04:\nsudo apt-get install python3\n\nSame thing for setuptools:\nsudo apt-get install python3-setuptools\n\nTo get pip3 please look at How to install pip for python 3 in ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n", "Q: Crashkernel is still being added by update-grub after removing linux-crashdump Once I installed linux-crashdump by following this tutorial.\nBut I don't need it any more, so I removed the linux-crashdump, crash and kdump-tools packages. \nRegardless, the crashkernel kernel parameter is still being added to my grub.cfg by the update-grub script, so 128M of my memory is still being reserved for nothing.

I know it will work, but what problems will I encounter? What drivers should I download? And how do I install this from an external optical drive?\n\nA: Why not?\nIf you doubt, why not try the Live CD or USB of Ubuntu to see if you or the laptop likes it.\n\nA: You should have no problems running Ubuntu on your Asus. I don't see any limitations that would prevent it from running on your computer. Now when it comes to drivers that is a whole different story, for the most part Ubuntu should be able to find generic drivers for your computer; one of the great things about Ubuntu is that everything just works! However some drivers such as a graphics card driver for example may require you to download and install the official driver to get full performance out of the graphics card, mostly due to the fact that the generic driver may not have been designed to take full performance of the capable hardware (At least this was/is my situation). Other than the little tweaks you will have to make, and the few bumps in the road you may come crossed, switching to Ubuntu for the most part should be a smooth transition. \n", "Q: More Explanation on File Sharing In a recent question about configuring file sharing between Ubuntu computers, someone gave the following helpful answer:\n\nSamba is intended for sharing between windows and ubuntu. For sharing in between\nUbuntu I would suggest nfs. See help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/network-file-\nsystem.html Takes about 10 min. to setup. –  Rinzwind yesterday\n\nI went to that page and followed the instructions until I got to:\n\nYou can configure the directories to be exported by adding them to the /etc/exports\nfile. For example:\n/ubuntu  *(ro,sync,no_root_squash)\n/home    *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)\nYou can replace * with one of the hostname formats. Make the hostname declaration as\nspecific as possible so unwanted systems cannot access the NFS mount.\n\nThe page mentions \"the directories to be 'exported.'\"\nDoes the word exported mean the same thing as \"shared,\" because prior to that the page talked about sharing, then uses \"exported.\"\nSecond, what does the line mean, \"You can replace * with one of the hostname formats\"?\nDoes this refer to the shared name I intend to use?\nThird, if my directory name has a space, should I put the path in double quotes (\"/media/****/6CCC5DC2CC5*****/Media Server\")?\nFourth, if I should have added these comments to the original post that I saw, please advise. I understood that further questions were not to be appended in that location.\nThanks for any help. My learning at this point feels like I'm drinking from a fire hose.\nRaif\n\nA: \nDoes the word exported mean the same thing as \"shared,\"\n\nYes, it does.\n\nThird, if my directory name has a space, should I put the path in double quotes (\"/media/****/6CCC5DC2CC5*****/Media Server\")?\n\nYes, you should.\n\nSecond, what does the line mean, \"You can replace * with one of the hostname formats\"?\n\nYou can limit what each hostname is permitted to do, ex. host a may mount the export (=share) readonly, host b may mount read/write..\nThe hostname format may be  specified by using a dns name, ip, ip range...\n\nI understood that further questions were not to be appended in that location.\n\nCorrect, you open new questions for... well, new questions :-)\n", "Q: Unable to install Box2D package If I try to run sudo apt-get install python-box2d I get this nonsensical error message:\nReading package lists...

In other words, a central program acts as a server, and various client programs connect to the server to make requests.\nMySQL Server, or mysqld, is the database server program. The server manages access to the actual databases on disk and in memory. MySQL Server is multi-threaded and supports many simultaneous client connections. Clients can connect via several connection protocols. For managing database contents, MySQL Server features a modular architecture that supports multiple storage engines that handle different types of tables (for example, it provides both transactional and non-transactional tables).\nNote : But sqlite in just no sql file where it can br read and write to  main certain amount of data.

Because I think they share the same issue i will post one example first.\nI have a fresh ubuntu-server 14.04 with lubuntu-desktop and xrdp package installed. When I login with xrdp I should have the normal restrictions as polkit was defined. First I thought I just don't have enough permission for certain actions.

How can I check if policykit agent is running in my xrdp-session? Can I start it manually?

Everything was fine, but one month after I installed Ubuntu using the Install Alongside Windows option, I started receiving invalidation errors with Windows 7.

I know sometimes Windows can get a little picky if it suddenly sees it's root partition is smaller than it once was. Usually it just does a simple disk check and that's it.

I need a bash command to delete the entire file if the file itself begins with <html>.  \nI'm not sure the best way to go about this...\nContext:  I download a series of files via curl requests.  Most time the downloads and processing work fine.  But other times the download request results in a 404 for whatever reason.  When I get those, the contents of the downloaded file begins with a html tag.  When the rest of my processing hits this file, it hangs.  So I want to run a command prior to my other processing to cat each of the files and delete the file if it has this html tag.\n\nA: I just tested this, it works.  \nRun shopt first because we don't want to parse ls:  \nshopt -s nullglob  \n\nthen use a simple bash for loop to find files that begin with <html> and remove them:\nfor i in *; do if [ \"$(head -n 1 \"$i\")\" == '<html>' ]; then rm \"$i\"; fi; done  \n\nIt would be safer to use:  \nfor i in *; do if [ \"$(head -n 1 \"$i\")\" == '<html>' ]; then rm -i \"$i\"; fi; done  \n\nto have rm ask before removing any files, just in case.  \nNote that shopt isn't strictly needed but it prevents certain issues from occurring if the directory is empty or there happens to be a file with an asterisk in its name. \n\nA: To address the question that prompted you to ask this one, rather than the one you actually asked:\ncurl can tell you the status code in addition to downloading the file. You do not need to check the file's contents for that. An example of how to check the status is\nstatus=$(curl -w '%{http_code}' \"${url}\" -o \"${file}\")\ntest \"${status}\" -eq 200 || rm -- \"${file}\"\n\nThe various options you can use with -w are documented in the manual, and depending on your needs, you may want to extend this to output more information and parse it, and/or change the check of the status code to allow more than merely 200.\n\nA: You could use this find command to delete all files only containing only the <html> pattern in the first line:\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c 'sed q \"$0\" | grep -qP \"^<html>$\" && rm \"$0\"' {} \\;\n\n\nA: Not every automating task should be done with shell.

This writes the current (textual) terminal content to a file; the -f option is to update the output file on each write event to the terminal. The script command is made to keep record of everything that happens in a terminal window.\nThe script below imports this output periodically.\nWhat this script does\nIf you run the script in a terminal window, it opens a second terminal window, initiated with the script -f command. In this (second) terminal window, you should run your command to start the benchmark process. While this benchmark process produces its results, these results are periodically (every 2 seconds) compared to your \"golden run\". If a difference occurred, the differing output is displayed in the \"main\" (first) terminal and the script terminates. A line appears, in the format:\nerror: ('Solutions: 13.811084', 'Solutions: 13.811084 aap noot mies')\n\nexplanation:\n\nerror: (<golden_run_result>, <current_differing_output>)\n\nAfter this output, you can safely close the second window, running your tests.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file.\nWhen you look at your \"golden run\" file, the first section (before the actual test starts) is irrelevant and might differ on different systems. Therefore you need to define the line where the actual output begins. In your case I set it to:\nfirst_line = \"**** REAL SIMULATION ****\"\n\nchange it if necessary.\n\n*Set the path to your \"golden run\" file.\n\n*Save the script as compare.py, run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/compare.py\n\n`\n\n*a second window opens, saying Script started, the file is named </path/to/file>\n\n*in this second window, run your benchmark test, the first differing result appears in the first window:\n\n\n\nHow I tested\nI created a small program that prints the lines of an edited version of your golden run, one by one.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 installed with Wubi.\nMy problem is I cannot connect to my wifi and I cannot see my files at data.\nIt asks for the root password to login but I don't know it.\n\nA: When you installed Ubuntu, you must have created an User and assigned a password to it, right? By default that user is an administrator and can ask for root privileges. So whenever asked for root password, just key in the password of the user.\n\nA: you can change the password by following method:restart your system, go to recovery mode (inside advanced options for ubuntu), enter root option. now on command-line type passwd and enter. now enter new password, re-enter the password. afterwards type reboot. see whether your problem is solved.\n", "Q: Can't edit anything on FTP server I have a serious problem. When at work, I work directly on our development FTP server, using sublime text.\nHowever, since upgrading to 14.10, I can't edit anything on any server. Creating new folders or files will make nautilus jump to my home folder, and then when entering the ftp server again, it will crash. This part seems similar to this bug report (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/1385919). However I have the same problem when creating or saving files. \nWhen I create a file through the nautilus right click menu, a similar incident will happen - however when I try to save with Sublime, it'll show me a popup asking if I want to write to a protected file. At this point, I have noticed that nautilus once again have changed to my home folder - and when I press overwrite, it states that the file can't be found. I have tried letting nautilus crash and reopen it before pressing overwrite - to no avail.\nThis problem severely hinders my ability to use Ubuntu on my work machine, and I do not understand how such a problem could ship with a major release of the system. I have had no trouble with 14.04 - and I do not get an error message or are able to send a crash report.\nI hope someone is able to help me.\n\nA: As I had the exact same problem, I followed the link shown by DavidKunz. I noticed they suggest using a stpf connection since passwords are send unencrypted when using ftp. So I changed to sftp and am now able to copy and paste files on the ftp server using nautilus.\n\nA: This might be not much of an useful solution to this problem, but since had exactly the same I thought you might be interested in a work-around.\nFollowing these instructions I was able to mount the ftp directory locally, thus being able to edit it in Sublime. It slower then I'm used to, but at least it's something until the Nautilus bug gets fixed.\n", "Q: MAAS : Unable to import boot images I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and when I run \nmaas root node-groups import-boot-images\n\nall I get is\nroot@maas:~# maas xxxx node-groups import-boot-images\n\nusage: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/maascli/__main__.py [-h] COMMAND ...\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/maascli/__main__.py: error: argument COMMAND: invalid choice: u'xxxx' (choose from u'list', u'login', u'logout', u'refresh')\n\nwhen I run maas-import-pxe-files I get this error:\nroot@maas:~# maas-import-pxe-files\n\nusage: maas-import-pxe-files [-h] --sources-file SOURCES_FILE\nmaas-import-pxe-files: error: argument --sources-file is required\n\nroot@maas:~# maas-import-pxe-files --sources-file /etc/maas/bootresources.yaml\n\n2014-10-28 14:16:05,919 ERROR Unhandled exception; unable to continue.\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n\nFile \"/usr/sbin/maas-import-pxe-files\", line 30, in <module>\n    main(args)\n\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/provisioningserver/import_images/boot_resources.py\", line 269, in main\n    sources = read_sources(args.sources_file)\n\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/provisioningserver/import_images/boot_resources.py\", line 197, in read_sources\n    return BootSources.load(filename=sources_yaml)\n\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/provisioningserver/config.py\", line 349, in load\n    return cls.parse(stream)\n\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/provisioningserver/config.py\", line 343, in parse\n    return cls.sources.to_python(yaml.safe_load(stream))\n\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/formencode/api.py\", line 439, in to_python\n    value = tp(value, state)\n\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/formencode/compound.py\", line 58, in _to_python\n    to_python)\n\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/formencode/foreach.py\", line 102, in attempt_convert\n    error_list=errors)\n\nInvalid: Errors:\nThe input must be dict-like (not a <type 'str'>: 'boot')\n\nand I don't get any images, same goes for the web ui.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: First login mass from console by using this link.\nThen from console:\nsudo maas root node-groups import-boot-images\nImport of boot images started on all cluster controllers\n\n", "Q: LVM VG is not activated during system boot Since upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10, one of my VGs doesn't come online when the system boots up, and unfortunately, this VG has my root FS, thus I'm dropped to the initrd BusyBox prompt.\nPreviously I had the issue that the VG needed more time to come online at boot, thus I added rootdelay=300 to the kernel argument list, and although the boot process hanged for some time, the VG eventually came online. But after the release upgrade, my VG never comes up. In the BusyBox prompt, lvm lvscan tells me they are inactive. I can activate them manually and proceed with the boot process, but as it is a server, it is really bad that it requires human interaction to properly boot up.\nI suspect something's wrong with the new kernel, vmlinuz-3.16.0-23-generic.

I have previously installed Ubuntu 14.04 on its own,  but I would like to Dual-Boot Linux Mint Debian Edition alongside it, I thought I'd ask here, because Ubuntu is my 1st OS installed, and I would like to know the dangers. Also would Ubuntu and LMDE both show up when I boot the PC (So I can choose). Is there any tutorials on this?\n\nA: You should be able to follow the installation prompts of LMDE without hassle. Your bootloader might not be correctly installed if LMDE uses another older GRUB version. Then you will have to use a Ubuntu Live CD/USB with Boot-Repair (choose automatic mode).\nIf you already get a list of operating systems after installing LMDE, this step is not needed.\nAlways carefully look at your partitions, because otherwise you may overwrite your Ubuntu partition. Prepare your disk partitions before the installation of LMDE (from within a Ubuntu Live CD). For LMDE, you need at least one root partition (ext4 probably) and a swap partion (but since you have already installed Ubuntu, you can reuse that). Use GParted to create an extra root partion (resize your Ubuntu installation if you need space to create another partition)\nYou will have to try if LMDE live wants to dualboot, because I've seen scenarios where it did not want to install. If that's the case, you cannot install LMDE but Ubuntu is left untouched, fortunately.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Why my Graphics card is disabled after installing Ubuntu Gnome 14.04LTS? Hello I installed Ubuntu Gnome 14.04LTS then after installation I found out that my Graphics Card is disabled. Why? Im on a hybrid machine with IntelCore i3 and AMD RADEON Graphics card. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: Your graphics card is not disabled. Rather you are on Generic Xorg Display drivers. You need to install the proprietary AMD drivers to be able to use your AMD Graphics card.\nYou can search for additional drivers in applications. And enable the drivers suitable for your Graphics cards. And if the Drivers support hybrid configuation, you should be freely able to switch between your Intel HD and Radeon chipsets.\nIf the above method doesn't let you control the hybrid configuration, Ubuntu Documentation has a manual way of installing drivers in order to control the hybrid chipset. \n", "Q: deleting hibernate image after failed hibernation after trying \nsudo pm-hibernate\nmy w520 can't start anymore.\nonly when adding a 'noresume' to the kernel parameters I can start with grup.\nwhat are the steps to remove all the hibernate disaster?\nformating swap partition?\nwhat about fstab?\n\nA: I would also try removing (unmounting), formatting and readding (as swap) the linux-hibernate partition using gparted.

Some networks work fine, like my Android hotspot, but unfortunately among the networks with problems are my home network and school network.\nThe problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trying to connect lasts very long, is mostly unsuccessful, showing \"Disconnected: network\" or \"Disconnected: \". Sometimes I need to restart Wireless, sometimes entire Networking, sometimes I even need to reboot the system to make it connect.\n\n*When connected, after a while (sometimes hours, sometimes 10 sec) all communication stops. ping 192.168.1.1 unsuccessful,  ping google.com unknown host. When this happens, I have to manually disconnect and reconnect, where I often crash into the first problem and in the end I have to reboot.\n\n\nThis is very, very frustrating.

DeadBeeF can convert audio files easily.\n(For a solution to a possible problem, see How to convert audio files in Deadbeef player.)\nThere are different options but they are not editable\n\nand new converting options can be added and edited\n\nWhat command should I add there for a different FLAC level of compression for example?\n\nA: In fact the options are editable: you cannot remove the built-in options, but you can add modified versions of them by saving the changes under a new name. (You cannot make changes and save under a pre-existing name.)\nSo, the easiest way to add convert options is to use the 'Copy' button and then modify the commands and titles.\nFor FLAC:\nSelect [Built-in] FLAC (compression leve 5) --> Copy --> Title: flac compression level 8, command line: flac -o %o -8 -ignore-chunk-sizes -\n--> Ok\nSee flac -h in Terminal for variables. 0 is the largest file (best quality) and the fastest process, 8 is the smallest file (best compression) and slowest process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly for the other formats.\n", "Q: gnome control center shows only a few icons When using gnome-control-center, it shows only a few icons, like this:\n\nI am using i3 and I am calling gnome-settings-daemon on start.

I have another directory, folder2, that is not shared, but contains a lot of subfolders that I do want to share.  When a user connects to my shared folder1 I would like them to also see the subdirectories from folder2.  \nCurrently the way I accomplish this is to open up folder2 in gnome, right-click on the directories there, and select Make Links.  Then I take the symbolic links and manually cut and paste them into folder1.\nI would like to have it so that when I create a new directory in folder2, a symbolic link to it is created inside folder1.  How should I go about this?  I'm using Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: There may be automagical ways to do this, but just writing a few shell scripts is probably the easiest way to address this.\nFirst, instead of just creating a new subdirectory in folder2, do it with a script that also creates the symbolic link at the same time. The following untested script will do that once you fill in the real paths to your directories. The core script is really simple, but I added some error processing so it would have a chance in the real world.\n#!/bin/bash\n## create subdirectory and symbolic link\n## Usage: script-name <name of new subdirectory to create and link>\n\nPRIVATE=\"path to private directory\" ## Put real path here\nSHARED=\"path to shared directory\" ## Put real path here\ncd \"${PRIVATE}\"\nif [ -z \"${1}\" ]\nthen\n  echo \"Aborting - no new directory name specified\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ -e \"${1}\" ]\nthen\n  echo \"Aborting - file or directory with that name already exists\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nmkdir \"${1}\"\nRC=$?\nif ((RC))\nthen\n  echo \"Aborting - Failed to create new private subdirectory named [${1}] in [${PRIVATE}] with error code [${RC}]\"\n  exit ${RC}\nfi\n\ncd \"${SHARED}\"\nln -s \"${PRIVATE}/${1}\" .\nRC=$?\nif ((RC))\nthen\n  echo \"Aborting - Failed to create new symlink named [${1}] in [${SHARED}] with error code [${RC}]\"\n  exit ${RC}\nfi\n\nexit 0\n\nOther concerns:\nIf you need to access this from a gui instead of the command line, just add a little code that calls yad to create a dialog box to ask for the name of the directory to create and then create an entry for your script in your menu system and, optionally, on your desktop or panel. Doing this is simple, but beyond the scope of this question.\nSimilarly, if something else creates the new subdirectories in folder1, you can write a script which scans for new subdirectories in folder1 and then symlinks them to folder2.\nYou could run this manually, or run it inside of a loop where it does its work, sleeps for awhile, and then runs again.\nThis \"daemon\" script could either be started manually or run from your .login script so it will start every time you login. It could also be started from cron if you make sure that any subdirectories and links it creates have the desired owner, group, and permissions. (You probably don't want them owned by root which is the user cron runs under.)\nIt all depends on what your exact requirements are.\nIf either folder1 or folder2 require elevated privileges for writing, then your script will need to either be run with those permissions or have a sudo or two to handle that, and possibly, an entry in sudoers so it doesn't have to ask for your password every time. Then, the script itself would have to have a secure owner and restricted permissions and be kept in a directory which also requires elevated privileges for writing - for security reasons.\nYou may also need to consider the case when subdirectories are deleted from folder1. Then, you will probably want to delete the broken symlinks from folder2. The approach/code would be very similar to the above.\n", "Q: Too slow to Download USB bootable Ubuntu program I wonder why its takes over 11 hours to download the file: ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\nI'm in China and using VPN, if no VPN it will force me to a Chinese site which gives China's own Ubuntu.

Restarting router numerously didn't help.\nIt doesn't show on the windows machine on the network or windows on my machine(it is a dual boot system) any more but I saw at least once on both. I guess I only have one option now.\n\nA: Since you mentioned in comment that the other computer on the network started having the same issue, it may well be that your router settings are altered or the router is infected (yes, that is possible). In fact, your problem is very very similar to this post from security.stackexchange.com . FIY, you may want to use that site in such cases , cuz there's more people who deal with this type of issues. \nOK, back to the problem . If you research it a little you'll find that probably a very common problem with routers is when DNS settings are altered. There's also more serious malware for routers,too. DNS server is basically a translator: since computers only deal in numbers, when you type \"google.com\" in a browser, your computer will send request to DNS servers saying \" Hey, what's IP address for google.com? \" . DNS server on his side looks through databases, and finds what IPs belong to google.com. Now, if your router's DNS settings are changed, the request goes to a fake DNS server, which will redirect you to fake website or a website that looks like real thing but with malware.\nWhat can be done is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access your router's settings, and check if DNS settings have been\naltered. You can access them typically by typing 192.168.0.1 into\naddress bar of Firefox or any other browser, and it should open a page with all sorts of settings for your router (read up on your router's manual to make sure the address is right). But if you've never\nlooked at these settings before, it may be hard to determine whether\nor not something has been changed. Also, look if any routing settings were changed or you see something fishy there.\n\n*Reset the router to default settings. Again, this can be done through\n192.168.0.1 . This may be under \"Advanced Options\", but search around the settings or just read the manual.  Good idea is to reboot the\nrouter after you changed the settings back to default to make sure it\ntakes effect. If that helps and the popup doesn't come up any more on\neither machine, change router's admin password to something else than\nbefore and something strong, plus maybe change wifi password (WPA PSK\nor whatever you're using).\n\n*Get a new router. You could either buy one yourself and configure it\nor contact your Internet service provider , explaining the situation.\nThey may offer more options, too.\n\n\nAmong other things, what I'd do in such case is do some small tests. \n\n\n*\n\n*You mentioned that you connect by wifi and have Windows files there.\nSo is it a laptop ? you double boot ? Try taking it to another\nnetwork, and see if pop-up persists. If it doesn't show up on another\nnetwor - it's definitely your router.\n\n*Does it show up in Windows ? If it's the router , it's definitelly\nnot related to OS or your browsers or anything like that.\n\n*Change your settings for DNS in Ubuntu. The thing is that Ubuntu's\nNetwork Manager by default will let a dnsmaq plug in decide what DNS\nto use (and typically it will be your internet service provider's').\nNow, you can use your own DNS regardless of what internet service\nprovider gives. To do that - open the Networ Manager indicator in the\nright side corner and go to Edit connections. Select the network, and\nclick Edit button. Go to IPv4  tab, change drop down menu from\n\"Automatic (DHCP)\" to \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\", and where\nDNS servers type in whatever DNS server you like. You can choose\n8.8.8.8 (Google's public DNS). I use OpenDNS(208.67.222.222). these are well known and trusted. Then open terminal and type\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and change line\ndns=dnsmasq to #dns=dnsmasq. Save file with Ctrl+O and exit with\nCtrl+X. Now you could either do sudo service network-manager restart or simply reboot the computer. I'd prefer rebooting. \nConnect again to your network, and once ready in terminal type\nnm-tool | tail. It should confirm you're using your selected DNS.\nIf popup doesn't persists with such settings - definitely  router's\nDNS problem. Steps I've gone through here is same as I've described in my other post here\nThat is it. I'm in no way computer security expert, so everything in this post is the best I can suggest. Best of luck! and let us know if this helps, or how you solved the problem in the end.\n\nA: Could it be your Proxy settings routing your traffic via some server that injects this in to the HTML?

I have an application in C++ which uses OpenCV for Ipcamera video processing, I am working in Ubuntu 14.04.\nI am going to try to explain what I did:\nFirst I wanted to check if a script could be called in the boot, so I created this simple script which only create a file in the same directory in which I have my script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\nRUTA_ENTORNO=`dirname $0`\n\necho \"Creando archivo de prueba...\"\ntouch ${RUTA_ENTORNO}/ArchivoPrueba.txt\nexit 0\n\nI add into the rc.local the next line:\nsh /home/myScript\n\nAnd when I reboot my computer the file it was created, so perfect.\nThen I compiled my application, and I move the executable in the same folder of my Script, and I add this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n/home/executable\nRUTA_ENTORNO=`dirname $0`\n\necho \"Creando archivo de prueba...\"\ntouch ${RUTA_ENTORNO}/ArchivoPrueba.txt\nexit 0\n\nI added the /home/executable line in my Script for executing it, and for checking if after this the file.txt is created.\nBut here is what I do not understand, when I reboot my system the camera is not running. It seems that the application is not throwing any errors, but the file.txt is created. However if in the terminal I run sh /home/myScript, the application starts and I can see the camera, but the file.txt is not created.\nHow can I run my application in automatic way when I reboot my system?\n\nA: I'll speculate a bit on this:\n\n\n*\n\n*/home/executable probably depends on the graphics being initialized, which I think would mean after the GUI is running.\n\n*If the GUI is not running, it probably exits with an error, and your script continues to the remaining part (which is why the file isn't created). output from rc.local is discarded, so you wouldn't know if it threw an error.\n\n*If the GUI is running, your program continues to run, so the script doesn't reach the remaining section until you close it.\n\n\nConsider using an Upstart session job. Create a .conf file in ~/.config/upstart (say camera.conf) containing:\ndescription \"My OpenCV-based camera app\"\nstart on startup\nstop on session-end\n\nexec /home/executable\n\nNow it should automatically start when you log in. You can use the following commands to start and stop your application (camera is the name of the .conf file you created):\nstart camera\nstop camera\n\nYou can also add respawn to the configuration file, if you want Upstart to start the program again if you close it.\n", "Q: Error: 'There was a problem connecting to the CUPS server.'after upgrade 14.04 to 14.10 After upgrade from 14.04 to 14.10, I can not use my (SAMBA) network printer anymore.

I know of another similar case at ubuntuforums.org that also fixed the issue.\nI suggest you go here: http://people.canonical.com/~sforshee/lp1361809/linux-3.13.0-37.64+lp1361809v201410060628/ Download the .deb files for the linux-image and linux-image-extra appropriate to your architecture; either 32- or 64-bit. Find out from the terminal: \narch\n\ni686 is returned for 32-bit systems and x86_64 for 64-bit systems. So, for example, if yours is a 64-bit system, download the linux-image amd64.deb file and the linux-image-extras amd64.deb file. Install with:\ncd ~/Downloads  <--or wherever you downloaded the files\nsudo dpkg -i linux*.deb\n\nReboot and let us hear your result.\nIf performance is not improved, let's try a driver parameter:\nsudo -i\necho \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nexit\n\nAnd then reboot and test.\nIf this is ineffective, please do:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Change the last line to read:\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor. Reboot and test.\n", "Q: Ap-hotspot wifi clients can't reach each other I am using ap-hotspot to create a wireless access point for 2 computers and a phone.

So in light of this I am looking to implement a server to host this application which will provide lightweight functionality to my parents' home business.\nI am asking this question because I don't know where oracle VM stores it's virtual disk on my physical disk (so I don't know what I may be overwriting) and also because I don't know if installing this OS via a VM will mess with my PC's boot sectors (I have been there before and wish to avoid this).\nThanks in advance for your help :)\n\nA: VMs isolate the guest OS from the host OS.\n You can safely do whatever you want in the VM and do not need to fear that you may somehow overwrite data on the host OS or change the hosts boot sectors.\n\nA: Sure you can.\nOracle VM VirtualBox is storing its virtual machine disks on plain files on your host OS so there is no risk to mess with your existing data.\n\nA: You are good to go. A VM isolates the guest OS in memory.\nBasically the VM \"thinks\" it is a stand alone.\n", "Q: Should I use sublime text editor for Web Development in Ubuntu or is there some better editors? I want to do some Web Development. I used to have sublime text editor in Windows. Now that i have switched to Ubuntu 14.04.01, I was wondering which is the best test editor to use for easily creating web pages. \n\nA: If you felt comfortable using Sublime Text then that is ok to use since the Command Palette and extensibility were clear advantages . From my personal experience i suggest you to try \"vim or emacs\".  \n\nA: If you're looking for something simpler than sublime but still highlights syntax and has autocomplete, kedit is a good choice.\n", "Q: Check whether less than some amount of free disk space from the command line There are several questions and answers on askubuntu about seeing disk space from the command line.\nNaturally, df is the go-to tool for this.\nHowever I want a script at login to raise an alert if the free disk space is below some threshold.\nUnfortunately df seems to use arbitrarily sized columns and I'm not sure how to extract just the value from the column I'm interested in.\nFor example:\n$ df /dev/mapper/root\nFilesystem       1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/root   2563092 1649968    763212  69% /\n$ df /dev/mapper/root | tail -n 1\n/dev/mapper/root   2563092 1649968    763212  69% /\n$ df /dev/mapper/root | tail -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 9\n763212\n\nReally I want the fourth column, yet I must ask for the ninth.\nIs there an easier way to either extract the column's value from df's output, or another way altogether to access this value.\n\nA: Just realized that this isn't what was asked for, this shows an alert if the space used is greater than a predefined threshold. I'll leave it for further reference though.\nYou could use something like the script below\n#!/bin/bash\nX=\nX=$(du -sc | awk 'NR < 2' | awk '{ print $1 }')\nif [ $X -gt 999000 ]; then\n  message=\"Already using `du -sch | awk 'NR <2' |awk '{ print $1 }'` KB\"\necho $message | mail -s \"File System Full Warning\" email@address.com\nfi\n\nX holds the number of KB used, if greater than 999000 it emails a warning message.\n\nA: If you're on Ubuntu 14.04 or later, df can output only the values you want it to:\n$ df --output=avail /\n   Avail\n15127808\n\nFrom man df:\n--output[=FIELD_LIST]\n      use the output format defined by FIELD_LIST, or print all fields\n      if FIELD_LIST is omitted.\n...\nFIELD_LIST  is a comma-separated list of columns to be included.  Valid\nfield names  are:  'source',  'fstype',  'itotal',  'iused',  'iavail',\n'ipcent',  'size',  'used',  'avail',  'pcent'  and  'target' (see info\npage).\n\nAs noted by Drew Noakes, this ability was added in GNU coreutils 8.21, and so isn't available in older versions of Ubuntu.\nFor selecting fields, awk is a far better tool than cut, and you can build on Jan's answer for that after picking the fields you want df to output.\n\nA: I'd use an awk to only deal with the second line (skips the first here) and get you your column:\n$ df /dev/mapper/sil_acababdfabcf1 | awk 'NR==2 {print $4}'\n11903752\n\n", "Q: Program windows turn gray and then go back to normal again I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a Toshiba C50D-A-133 laptop.\nAfter installation I opened a terminal, and ran sudo apt-get install with some packages. I remember PlayOnLinux , GIMP, etc.\nWhile the packages were being installed I started Empathy to enter the access data from my jabber account. In the shell window I saw that the Windows fonts were unpacking. Empathy fades to gray, and after 1 or 2 seconds it goes back to normal, and I could enter the jabber account information. At the shell windows apt-get was unpacking the next packages.\nThen after this a window with an update notification appears. I chose there preferences, and I unmarked the checkboxes there. After closing, the windows turned gray too for about 1 or 2 seconds, then the notification \"no updates needed\" appears.\nI think that the windows became unresponsive because the system was busy. Is this correct or could something be damaged or wrong with my system? No program crashed or was aborted, only turned gray for a second, and then ran normally.\n\nA: The Toshiba C50D-A-133 laptop has an AMD E1-210 which only runs at 1GHz, not that great by modern standards. It is normal with a laptop with a slow CPU like that for the Ubuntu Software Center window to dim to gray when there are multiple packages queued up waiting to be installed. An application window turns gray when the processor is busy and the application is waiting for the processor to respond, and then after some time has elapsed, it times out and the window dims. A gray window caused by a timeout that dims and then goes back to normal won't cause any damage to your system.\nThere is something that you can do about it. If you find the gray-looking window in the Ubuntu software Center annoying, you can install multiple packages from the terminal using a single command of the form:\nsudo apt-get install first-package second-package other-packages  \n\n...where you substitute the package names of the packages in the command with a space between each package name. If you install packages from the terminal, the terminal window will never turn gray and you will not have any problem with the window freezing, forcing you to force quit the Ubuntu Software Center and then try to install some packages that were at the end of the queue again. This is sometimes necessary, because when you force quit the Ubuntu Software Center the Ubuntu Software Center sometimes removes packages that have not started being installed from the queue, so you have to search for those  packages and click the Install button to install them a second time.\nOnce you get past the obstacle of updating your system and installing packages, you should expect to have fewer problems with applications windows dimming to a gray screen or not responding. On a laptop with a slow processor like yours, you may find it necessary when using GIMP to save your image in the middle of the job, close GIMP and then reopen the saved image in GIMP and continue the image editing from where you left off. Another tip for preventing application windows from getting gray screens is to avoid multitasking other applications when running a processor-intensive task.\n\nA: This may have more to do with available RAM than with CPU.  I get this problem frequently in virtual machines which have lots of CPU (I may not be running much of anything else) but sharply constrained RAM allotment.  I agree with the prior observations, however, that multitasking a lot of processes at once, especially when one or more of them requires a lot of resources, is the main trigger of this grey-out behavior. It will cause a lot of virtual memory swapping. (That said, if you have a slow CPU that might also cause this problem, even if low RAM does, as well.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu-Windows Public Folder File Share I have created a network share folder in my Ubuntu 14.04, I downloaded Samba and created a username and gave it a password.

I wanted to give it a try, so I followed the instructions here and executed sudo grub-install --pubkey=<my-key> /dev/sda. The only problem is that even though I properly signed all of GRUB's modules, it is incapable of loading them, including the ones necessary for performing signature checks in the first place. While verify_detached is built into GRUB, I get an error telling me that the hash function for SHA-256 isn't loaded. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here?\n\nA: You need to include the following modules in the core image itself: gcry_rsa gcry_sha256\nThe --modules option should work.\nBy the way, while working with this I noticed that GRUB performs no validation at all if you don't include the verify module in the core image.

My machine name is called \"machine\" and my username is \"machine\" so that when I'm on a terminal it says \"machine@machine\".\nQuestion: When I try to connect to my machine from an SSH client (iPhone through 3G), what do I type in for:\n\n\n*\n\n*username\n\n*example.hostname.com:port\n\n\nI assume the answer to (1) is \"machine\".  But what about (2)?  How do I find out my hostname and port? \n\nA: The best way is to get the machines IP address and connect the server. Also you can connect with the Mobile Terminal program from Cydia  with the command \nssh machine@IP  (If the default port 22 is not changed)\nIf port changed\nssh -p portnumber machine@ipaddress\n\nA: This will depend on if you are connecting on your local network, or trying to connect from a remote network (across the Internet).\nYou mentioned that your username on your computer is \"machine\", so this is what you would enter for the ssh username.\nRegarding the second part of your question \"example.hostname.com:port\":\nIf both your computer and your iPhone are connected to the same network, you need to know the IP address of your computer. On your computer, you can open up a terminal and type \nip a\n\nIf your computer is connected by an ethernet cable, look under the \"eth0\" listing to find the \"inet\" address. If it is connected wirelessly, look under the \"wlan0\" listing. It will look something like 192.168.1.5 or 10.0.1.5, or something to that effect. This is the address you will use when you connect from your iPhone. If you did not change the ssh port number, then you shouldn't have to specify it, as it will default to port 22.\nSo, for example, if your computer's IP address were 192.168.1.5, you would enter that, instead of \"example.hostname.com:port\".\nIf you are trying to connect to your computer from a remote network (across the Internet), then you'll have a few more steps. You will need to make sure that you have the ssh port 22 forwarded on your router to your computer's IP address (assuming you have control of your router and can make such modifications). And then you will need to know your external public IP address. That external address will be what you enter into your iPhone ssh client. You can find your external IP address easily from your computer by visiting a site such as http://www.ipchicken.com. Then you would enter that, instead of \"example.hostname.com:port\".\nHowever, if you are trying to connect remotely to a residential ISP account, you will most likely be given a DHCP lease from your ISP. Which means your external IP address will change regularly. The time your IP address lease lasts varies from ISP to ISP. It could be a few hours, to a few days. So you may need to regularly check your external address to make sure you have the correct one. \n", "Q: -bash: no such file or directory for ALL commands I can't use any command right now in linux besides cd.

I'd be tempted to chalk this up to being an unsolvable issue (due to something breaking between now and when I last played the game), except that sound was, by some miracle, working out of the box when I installed the game over the weekend.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit (perhaps, it happened after I installed manually a specific version of alsa-base package, because it was somehow required when I tried to build Java Hotspot and JVM from source on that host).\nI also checked \"strace\" output and installed only one symlink /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasound_module_conf_pulse.so that fixed the problem for me.

I was able to get bumblebee working on Fedora and openSUSE before on this machine so I am sure that I should be able to get it working but I can't seem to get it working with Ubuntu.\n\nA: First of all to get much trusty results, glxspheres is better than glxgears. You can use \"vblank_mode=0\" for get higher results but it is all about v-sync. If you can run a program with optirun command there is no problem to worry about because your Nvidia card works.\nYou know that your Nvidia card is working but don't know working fine or not, for that compare glxspheres results between intel and nvidia card.\nTo install glxspheres:\nDownload VirtualGL (.deb) from: \nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files/VirtualGL/\nNavigate to the folder containing the deb package and install it with\nsudo dpkg -i VirtualGL_*.deb\n\nRun glxspheres:\ncd /opt/VirtualGL/bin/\n\nvblank_mode=0 ./glxspheres\nto run with nvidia card:\nvblank_mode=0 optirun ./glxspheres\n\nNote: vblank_mode=0 is for disable the v-sync and it spends much battery power.

I have a drive on my Ubuntu machine shared over a network, and one of the computers that can access it is a Windows 7 computer.\nWhenever I am on my Windows computer and I copy a file to the Ubuntu shared folder, it appears as owned by nobody, and with limited permissions:\n-rwxr--r--  1 nobody nogroup\n\nI always have to go to the command line on the Ubuntu side and issue a chown command to make it so that I have permissions to edit the file.

If it is using Samba, edit the smb.conf and add the following two lines in the definiton of your share:\n[yourshare]\n...\nforce user = yourusername\nforce group = yourgroup\n...\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You should be able to do it with the --no-preserve flag in cp\ncp --no-preserve=ownership source destination\n\nedit: That will still have weird permissions (owner will be the user calling cp though). This will probably work better when copying from ntfs:\ncp --no-preserve=ownership,mode source destination\n\nThat will match it to the bitmask of the folder being copied into, so if you are logged in as \"user-a\" and copy into a dir with drwxr-xr-x perms (0755) the files will be owned by \"user-a\" and have -rw-r--r-- perms (0644).\n\nA: I think the problem is related to the Ubuntu side cause the shared directory doesn't have enough permission.\nSince any files which is created in the directory has parent-child relation permission feature So it's a good chance to change umask of the directory.\nDue to the wikipedia, \n\nIn computing, umask is a command that determines the settings of a\n  mask that controls how file permissions are set for newly created\n  files\n\nSo I think changing the umask of the directory may has worth of testing.\nTo archive changing of umask,there are a lot of documentations and examples in the network.\nwish to be worked.\n\nA: If the other answers don't help you out, as a last option you could write a small bash script that automatically gives you full permissions and ownership of just all files in your shared folder. You still would have to launch this one command manually, but you could avoid typing it for each file separately. Maybe there is also the possibility to make the script \"watch\" the folder and whenever it gets changed, permissions will be given immediately. Though I think this would only work while it is running and not detect changes between shutdown and next reboot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Thinks I Have Two Monitors Ubuntu thinks I have two monitors when I'm on a laptop.

The thing is, when it mounts, the folder is labelled \"Earth1\" instead of \"Earth\". There is still a folder in /media/username called \"Earth\" but when I attempt to open it, it gives the error:\n\nThis location could not be displayed. You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of 'Earth'.\n\nSo right now a whole bunch of programs are trying to access files in /media/username/Earth but returning errors.\nThis has been happening since I had a problem with Unity and had to reset some of my user settings. I'm currently logged in as admin, and I've checked the startup command and everything's fine there.\n\nUpdate 2017-10-31 (for future reference)\nI was using Startup Applications to mount Earth (BTW, Startup Applications runs at login, not at boot). Based on subin's answer, I switched to using the Disks utility, which saves its config to the /etc/fstab file (which tells the system to mount partitions at boot), and that worked fine. The fstab entry specified the mount point.\n\nA: Correcting the line in /etc/fstab should help. If you have used the disk utility to setup the auto mount options, you should see a line which contains the mount point (here /media/username/Earth) Check if the line exists. If not, use the disk utility to set it up again. Looks like the directory /media/username/Earth exists and it is not specified as the mount point, so when the auto mounter sees the directory Earth already existing, it creates another directory Earth1 and mounts the partition there.\n\nA: You may need to set user permissions by chowning the earth volume to your user name. This sounds complicated but is insanely easy & teaches you some CLI skills. (Not to be confused with chmod.)\n\nA: You can try changing it in /etc/fstab or making a folder in on the drive as root and then chowning it to your user.\nEDIT: I tried this a while ago and it worked perfectly after using fstab to mount it to the right place and  chowning a folder to fix the user problems.\n", "Q: Installing restricted drivers application I'm having trouble with my internet dard (which is a Broadcom).\nI have been told to install the restricted drivers application and then look for a proprietary driver.\nSo:--\ncan anyone tell me where I can find the restricted drivers application please?\nApparently I'm to put it on the desktop and install it from there.\nI was told another way: as apt-get can't find the application, supply it with a path.

Although I had swap set up during the install, the swap space was not there after installing. This has happened to many people, there seems to be a bug somewhere. I googled and found a solution to this\nhere.\nI followed the steps there, leaving out the ones that had to do with resume, because that is disabled on my install anyway. So I essentially did:\nsudo swapoff -a (turns off swap)\ncomment existing swap configuration in /etc/crypttab\ncomment existing swap configuration in /etc/fstab\nre-format swap partition with gparted as linux-swap\nsudo mkswap /dev/sdXX \nsudo swapon /dev/sdXX \nsudo ecryptfs-setup-swap \n\nThen I had a working swap and was happy, until I rebooted my laptop and was back to square one. \nLooking at the partition with gparted, it says file system unknown for the (former) swap partition, and needless to say I don't have any swap space available. \nSo, now my question is: Why did the file system formatting (as linux-swap) not survive the reboot? Is there anything I can do about that? \nIf I do blkid, the swap partition does not show up at all, so my problem seems to be different from this question.\nEdit: Still working on it, so I did the above procedure again, after which /etc/crypttab looks like this:\ncryptswap1 UUID=xxxx /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nplus some lines that are commented out. And /etc/fstab contains this line:\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nBoth new lines however look exactly the same (apart from the UUID) as what was generated the last two times. So I don't have great hopes that it will stay when I reboot. \nGparted now shows the partition I am using as linux-swap. (Before rebooting)\nAlso blkid gives this line:\n/dev/sda7: UUID=\"xxxx\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\nI tested the swap and it works, i.e. I started a program that used a lot of memory and checked how much was loaded into swap in the system monitor. \nEdit2: Turns out that 3 is not the magic number that fixes this issue. The content of the two files is unchanged, blkid does not show the line with /dev/sda7 anymore and gparted shows the swap partition as \"unknown\". \nAny suggestions the output of what I could look at or what else I could try are really welcome. My workaround at the moment is to just not reboot, but sometimes when there is an update, my laptop really wants to reboot. \nEdit3: Is there really nothing else one could try to fix this? Any commands I could try? Any output I could look at?\n\nA: This is not happening in the reboot. After you finish your setup (running ecryptfs-setup-swap), go back to gparted and reload the table & open a terminal and run: sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda. You gonna find that partition still having Id 83 Linux Swap and became in Unknown format.\nWhy is that?! It became an encrypted partition already.\nIn /etc/fstab:\n\n\n*\n\n*Old swap partition was commented.\n\n*New mapped one inserted:\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nThis is fine.\nIn /etc/crypttab:\n\n\n*\n\n*A new line added to map the swap:\ncryptswap1 UUID=xxxx /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nBut there is something wrong here, Does an encrypted partition have a UUID (non-encrypted)?!!!\n\n\n*\n\n*So set the dev path directly as this example:\ncryptswap1 /dev/sdXX /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\n\n*Reboot then the Swap will be on. \nBTW, This should be reported as a bug. ecryptfs-setup-swap should use device path instead of uuid.\nUpdate: I could find same answered question which include the bug report too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Swap not working on clean 14.04 install using encrypted home\n\n*Bug report#953875 Encrypted swap no longer mounted at bootup\nIt contains the canonical answer by adding an offset= in the crypttab options. \n\nA: You could try this from the terminal:\n sudo -i\n umount -a\n gedit /etc/fstab\n\nand then type this in at the bottom:\n uuid   name   mount  type\n xxxxx  swap   /       sw   sw   errors=noremount   0\n\nand then type this in the terminal:\n mount -a\n\nand then use gpart, and set the swap drive swap /.\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: On Boot: \"The disk drive for UUID=... is not ready yet or not present\" I long ago deleted and disabled my swap partition but I still get the error\nThe disk drive for UUID=d4b17eae-c547-4d02-8d1d-0279069d35f0 is not ready yet or not present\n\nwhen booting and it is annoying.\nCan I just get into /etc/fstab and remove the last line that says  \nUUID=d4b17eae-c547-4d02-8d1d-0279069d35f0 none            swap     \n\nWould it stop giving me the error?\n\nA: Yes, that is exactly what you need to do.  \nsudo nano /etc/fstab  \n\nthen remove the line that says \nUUID=d4b17eae-c547-4d02-8d1d-0279069d35f0 none swap\n\nThen save (Ctrl+X)\nAnd the problem should be gone.\n\nA: The line\nUUID=d4b17eae-c547-4d02-8d1d-0279069d35f0 none            swap\n\nis saying\n\"There is a swap partition with id 123, and there is no noauto, so we will activate it during boot.\". \nThe UUID does not say on which disk that partition is, so the system tries to find it.\nAnd duly notes when it fails to do so.\nNow, the message you get is about a disk drive that is missing:\nThe disk drive for UUID=d4b17eae-c547-4d02-8d1d-0279069d35f0 is not ready yet or not present\n\nThat does make sense, because the line in fstab states \"There is a partition 123 on one of the disk drives.\". If that's true, but the partition can not be found, the conclusion is that the disk is not yet accessible.\nSo, it makes sense to remove that fstab line, because it states something wrong.\n(Actually, it's a good habbit to comment it out first, and delete it later, in case it can not become useful again later)\n", "Q: Restore EFI System Partition to state before installing Ubuntu I found this thread that says how to delete GRUB2 Uninstalling GRUB from UEFI laptop\nBut I'm not sure if it applies to me or if I'm doing the things correctly, I'll attach a few screenshots about the contents of EFI Partition and I would appreciate if you guide me what to delete and what to rename, I want to remove GRUB2 and restore the Partition to the original state (It came with Windows 8.1 pre-installed).\nAccording to the thread, deleting the Ubuntu and GRUB folders should be enough, but I feel it won't be enough since there are weird things like /EFI/EFI/Ubuntu (Why two folders with EFI?) /EFI/Boot and EFI/EFI/Boot, etc. you will see in the pictures but my instinc tells me, deleting won't be enough... :s\nHere I uploaded the screenshots, please take a look at them:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://imgur.com/XjoiAWA,ng2jt7r,neqQLEJ,FnyH9jH,IOuz2Fo,COmm7wL\nThanks for your attention :)\n\nA: If you haven't modified anything in \\EFI\\Microsoft (as it looks to me), then deleting the ubuntu folder next to the Microsoft folder should be sufficient.\n(If you have modified the contents then you should overwrite the Microsoft directory with Windows' bcdboot, have a look at the related section for instructions.)\nRegarding the confusion about the EFI folders:\nmount | grep efi\nnone on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars type efivarfs (rw)\n/dev/sda1 on /boot/efi type vfat (rw)\n\nAs you can see in the example from my system the ESP is mounted to /boot/efi/ and itself contains an EFI folder.

In fact, during one night, about 50 % of the battery is consumed. I have tested a second battery - but it's the same issue.

It allows find to prune, which prevents descending into the matching directories it can speed up your search considerably.\nfind -path '*/.*' -prune -o -print\n\nExplicit use of -print on the right side only prints the non-matching objects, in this case, visible files and folders.\n", "Q: I have installed ubuntu alongside Windows.

But if I want to switch to any of the non-active terminal windows I have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+Tab to switch to terminal group\n\n*release to activate the (active) window in the group\n\n*Ctrl+Tab (or whatever shortcut you have for that) to flip through the windows in the group\n\n*release to activate the new window\n\n\nThis is not at all what I want.

A productive work-flow is possible yet again! :)\n\nA: You may also use Alt+~ when you are on a grouped item in the standard Unity switcher to cycle through the grouped windows quickly. When your active window is a terminal that has siblings, you can use Alt+~ directly to switch between the windows of the same application.\nYou can use the compizconfig-settings-manager from my other answer to configure a different keyboard short cut for this behaviour as well:\n\nI find that with this additional shortcut it is easier to switch between applications than with the \"standard\" approach.\n\nA: Alexander's answer worked great for me. However I ran into the bad UI experience with Application Switcher as mentioned in the comments. My workaround was to disable other options under Switcher tab in Unity plugin in Compiz advanced settings. \n", "Q: Install 32 bit from USB, not a COM32R, then no PAE, 64 bit doesn't work either I hope someone can help me install a linux system of some sort please, have gotten a bit stuck. I have an old laptop (DEll Latitude D500, currently running Windows XP professional version 20012, Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor 1300MHz 1.30GHz, 512 MB RAM, 18.5 GB hard drive). I am trying to install a nice light operating system on it, like Lubuntu or Xubuntu and have been trying to get rid of Windows and install the new system using a bootable USB which I am creating on my PC running Ubuntu 14.04.\nWhen I try to boot the 32 bit version of either Lubuntu or Xubuntu, I first get the message: \nMissing parameter in configuration file. Keyword: path\ngfxboot.c32:not a COM32R image\nI tried a solution I found on these forums of hitting tab, then typing 'live' then enter. At which point it starts to complain that PAE is disabled and says I should 'use parameter 'forcepae'. However I can't actually type anything after this, the laptop just beeps if I try to.\nWhen I tried to install 64 bit versions of either operating system it came up with this: \nThis kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU. Unable to boot – please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU\nStarting to feel that no kernel is appropriate for my CPU!

By chance, I typed help at the prompt and was presented with a menu screen, offering me the option to Press enter to install which I did. The installation continued without a flaw.\n\nA: This is a bug. It happens when you create a bootable USB stick with an older version of Ubuntu than the version being installed on the USB stick.\nAlthough the answers given work to get around the issue it does not fix it as you have to do it every time you boot the USB stick.\n\nTo fix the USB installation so you do not have to type live and hit Enter every time you want to use it to live boot:\nIn the boot: prompt after you hit the error above, type live and press Enter, to start the Live USB session.\nOpen a terminal (e.g. with Ctrl+Alt+t) and type each command line below one by one:\nsudo -i\napt-get update\napt-get install syslinux\nmount | grep cdrom\n\nThe last command above tells you to which device your bootable USB is on.\nImportant! replace <device> in the command below in the terminal with the device in the output of the last command above. Which will be something like /dev/sdb1\nsyslinux <device>\n\nFor a more detailed version of this answer see this answer.\n\nA: The 64-bit version of Ubuntu requires a 64-bit CPU. This error simply means that your CPU only supports the 32-bit architecture. To fix this, you should install the 32-bit edition of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can I recover a deleted file? I have mistakenly deleted a file via while connected ssh. How I can recover that file or, if ubuntu has something like trash bin or so ?\n\nA: There's a special case where you can get a deleted file back - when it's still open in some program. You just have to figure out what program is using it.\nI saved this answer by Patrick from Unix and Linux Stack Exchange, but not a link to the original.\nRecovering a deleted file if the file is still open in a program.\nIf the file is still open, you can get it back by going to\n/proc/PID/fd where PID is the pid of a program that has\nthe file still open. This directory contains all the\nopen file descriptors of the program, and you can access them\njust like normal files, so you could copy the file off /proc.  – Patrick Dec 18 at 4:44 and – camh Dec 19 at 7:12 - Unix and Linux stackexchange\n\nA: rm versus deleting from GUI\nIf you used the command rm, you did indeed delete the file. The data is no longer reachable from the file system - except there was another hard link to the file (unusual), or you deleted a symbolic link.\nThe actual data may be still on the disk, on disk blocks the filesystem assumes to be unused. It you want to recover it, you should not write to the disk, because it could reuse the disk space holding you data. You could try regular data recovery on the file with the tools suitable for the file system you used.\nFor the default ext4 filesystem, see: \nIs there any recovery software available for ext4? and most answers on the question linked below.\nTrash for the CLI\nIt is possible to use the trash bin from the command line, but that's not set up by default. The package trash-cli contains commandline tools to use the trash bin of your desktop environment.  \nThere are commands like trash-put, trash-list etc;\nThe names are pretty long - you could define shell aliases like \nalias tp='trash-put'\n\nor \nalias del='trash-put'\n\nand then use del instead of rm to delete files or directories in a more safe way.\nAs it is proposed in the answer linked below, it's possible to use the alias name rm, replacing the actual rm command with trash-put, but there are multiple reasons not to do that; some of them are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The implementation of trash-put is much less well-tested that rm from 'GNU coreutils' in Ubuntu, for example.\n\n*The options of the default rm are not all supported by trash-put\n\n*Someone else will use the shell with the alias sooner or later, and will see a very broken rm command, technically.\n\n*A special syntax is needed when the real rm is required\n\n*Generally, it's not a good idea to mess with a very dangerous tool, at least risking confusion.\n\n\nHaving said that, see the answer of @enzotib on Can files/directories deleted with rm be restored? on how to configure the alias.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 (unity): rename workspaces (related to this question, but that is outdated)\nHow can I set the name of the workspaces?\n\nA: You can do this through the CompizConfig Settings Manager\nIf you have not installed CCSM, just open the terminal and run \nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nOpen CCSM and go to Workspace Naming under Window Management. If you can not see Workspace Naming, open a terminal and run\nsudo apt-get install compiz-plugins.\n\nEnable Workspace Naming plugin. If you get a message asking you to enable the Text plugin, enable it. When you enable the plugin, your screen may appear weird for a while and may take you back to the log in screen. Don't freak out, just log back in and open CCSM once again and follow the following steps to change the name of the workspace.\nAfter this all you have to do is select the workspace(It is called Viewport in this menu) and click edit to change the name. \nNOTE: CCSM is an extremely powerful tool but it is also possible for you to ruin your system by doing something wrong. So  please be cautious when using the tool.\n\nA: You refer to the \"Viewport n\" labels appearing when you switch workspaces? It has been said that \"there is no concept of workspace names\".\nBut you can make your own. Unity's workspace switcher move's compiz's \"viewport\" around over a big desktop. If you install wmctrl you can slide it around yourself. See this script for details. Perhaps you could adapt it to understand names for each workspace?\nYou can also programattically change the geometry of the workspace by modifying the dimensions of the workspace grid.

Did you get error messages from it?\nI'm not sure the dd command finished overwriting the whole partition with random data.\nAssuming it did finish, I would think you made a typo and were running photorec on the whold disk, /dev/sdb , instead of the partition, /dev/sdb1. Or you worked on the swap partition, /dev/sdb2.\nIn both cases, photorec would have scanned the swap partition (as part of the whole disk, or separately). That partition contains data that was in main memory RAM at some time. The RAM could contain some or all blocks of files for a lot of reasonst - so it would be not surprising when these end up in the swap partition.\n\nA: The only measure to securely remove all traces, remnants, and fragments of files in our hard drive is to backup those files we want to keep to another drive (not partition). \nWe can then completely overwrite the whole drive with Zeros (much faster) or random numbers, repartition it, and reformat that drive. After that any recovery will be impossible.\nFinally we may restore our backup files.\nNote that by doing so the UUID of the drive may change and the Master Boot Record will also be lost. Therefore we may have to edit references to that drive accordingly and we will also have to restore the MBR.\n", "Q: VLC Media Player display problems I installed VLC media player 2.2.0-pre2 Weatherwax (revision 2.2.0-pre1-15-g5178b24).

\nThere was a command being set from the key itself preventing us from getting to the sftp prompt, Thanks to everyone who attempted to help!\ncommand=/bin/bash ssh-rsa ...\n\nA: As per my comment, I replicated your setup and it works flawlessly in OpenSSH_6.0p1.\nI diffed the output I got , the only noticeable differences in your output were the lines 113 / 114: debug1: Remote: Forced command. in your output, unfortunately the part about which command was forced is missing.\nTo get this working using a (somewhat ugly) workaround, you could use a different local port for sftp and use a Match block that matches on said LocalPort, limiting the execution of  Forcecommand internal-sftp to clients connecting to that port...\n\nA: Some SFTP clients require PasswordAuthentication to be enabled.\nEnable password login, even if you are using a key to log in.\n\nA: Perhaps the cipher list is too long, edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config or $HOME/.ssh/config and add this in the Host * stanza (or for the host you have problems connecting to):  \nCiphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc\nMACs hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,hmac-ripemd160\n\n\nA: can you try creating a new user and seeing if you can login with him?

There are similar questions about Korean (hangul) that have already been asked and answered, but my problem seems different; more importantly, it isn't resolved by following the recommended steps.\nMost methods seem to indicate installing Korean within the language support menu (which I have) and the installing ibus-hangul (which I have).\nThe next step of the conventional wisdom is to use Terminal or the UI to get to the \"Input Method\" tab of ibus-setup, and from there use the \"Add\" button or dropdown to actually add Korean (hangul) to the list of layouts I can use.\nThe problem is that for me, Korean (hangul) appears NOWHERE, and the \"Add\" button is actually ghosted out. The box for \"Korean\" is checked under language support, im-hangul is installed, ibus is otherwise working fine.... I'm at wit's end.\nI'm fairly new to Linux, so please let me know if I need to call up some sort of log or report from Terminal to get more directed help.\n\nA: There should be a little flag or initials on the right side of the LxPanel.  Right click it and choose \"Keyboard Layout Handler\" Settings.  Uncheck Keep system Layouts (under Advanced setxkbmap Options).

This can be done with sudo usermod --home /path/to/home/ username. It will not move any files, although you can do that as well if you provide the --move-home option. \nI don't think you want to deny the right to change to the parent directory. That would be problematic and would serve no useful purpose. You need a way to access your home directory, so the parent must be accessible. What you probably do want, is to deny the right to see the content of the parent directory. That's something else. The execute bit (x) is used to allow people to change into a directory, whereas the read bit (r) is used to allow listing of files and directories contained in that directory. \nYou might simply do a sudo chmod o-r /var/www. Now, anyone (o=\"others\") will still be allowed to cd into /var/www, but if they try to do an ls -la, they will get a permission denied error. \nSo the permissions for /var/www should look like rwxrwx--x. \n", "Q: Daemon not running on boot On an Ubuntu (14.04) VM, I have a simple node server that I want to run on startup.

Sure enough, the lines \nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin\nexport NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/home/azureuser/npm/bin\n\nwere reversed. Switching these variables to point to the right directories, as well as adding a cd to the script before executing forever appears to have solved any issues the run script was having.\n", "Q: Why does my keyboard suddenly stop working?

Might not be worth the effort, tho!\nThanks to tudor, I guess.\nAll keyboards stopped working after login screen\n\nA: Dunno if it's worth mentioning, but i had a similar problem with Ubuntu 20.04 where the keyboard inputs stopped registering (although the keyboard seemed to be working fine, turning the LEDs on/off)\nAlthough not a proper fix, i managed to get it working again by using the mouse to lock the screen (upper right). Then the keyboard worked when i tried to input my password.\n\nA: An application seems to be messing with the keyboard. Trying to stop such an application like that (like \"GNOME Do\" or similar) would be my first guess.\nI'm assuming this, since they keyboard works before logging in and since it works in a guest session. Also I don't think it's driver related (or graphics related), for the same reasons. So an application seems to load for this one user and mess things up.\nCan you get to TTY with Ctrl+Alt+F1?\n", "Q: Webmin install?

It will ask you to reload, hit \"Reload\" and then give it a try again. \n", "Q: How to download all required Ubuntu drivers Is there a package of Ubuntu drivers as driver pack solution? I tried to search for it, but I did not find it. If there is, how can I easily get it?\n\nA: Most drivers are included in Ubuntu. If you need to install proprietary drivers that can't be included in Ubuntu, then you can get them automatically from the Software & Updates application. \n\n\nA: The Linux kernel contains a set of well-maintained open source drivers for almost everything1, but it does not contain proprietary drivers which are closed source. Ubuntu has a built-in ubuntu-drivers program that can decide automatically which proprietary graphics driver to install, and streamlines the installation of Nvidia drivers. Open the terminal and type:\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall   \nsudo reboot   \n\nThe autoinstall command of ubuntu-drivers installs drivers that are appropriate for automatic installation including their dependencies. In Ubuntu 20.04 and later running sudo apt upgrade not only upgrades the versions of the proprietary graphics drivers that were installed by sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall. Sometimes sudo apt upgrade even upgrades the proprietary graphics driver packages to more recent packages, in which case sudo apt autoremove removes the older packages which were replaced by the newer ones. For most users there's no reason to guess about which proprietary graphics driver to install, because if your system deserves a graphics driver upgrade it will get one.\nThe devices command of ubuntu-drivers lists proprietary drivers that are compatible with your computer's GPU. If your computer has an Intel processor and it doesn't have a discrete graphics processor, the command ubuntu-drivers devices will not return results that show that a proprietary graphics card driver is available to be installed because the Intel graphics driver is built-in in Ubuntu. Furthermore it is not necessary to uninstall any of the built-in graphics drivers because if a proprietary graphics driver is installed, Ubuntu will select it and use it automatically with the built-in graphics drivers remaining installed for possible use if Ubuntu has a problem running the proprietary graphics driver(s). If there already is a Nvidia  proprietary graphics driver installed in Ubuntu you will need to uninstall it before installing a replacement Nvidia  proprietary graphics driver.\nIf you visit the official AMD or NVIDIA websites you will often see that the latest version of the proprietary graphics driver for your GPU is a little bit more up-to-date than the version of the same graphics driver that is available from the default Ubuntu repositories. Don't worry about this, because if the difference between version numbers of the two proprietary graphics drivers is small, then you will get similar performance by using either of the two drivers. If you install a graphics driver from the default Ubuntu repositories, you will also get automatic updates for that driver which are sometimes linked to kernel updates.\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04:  (@) -> Preferences -> Software Sources ;\npassword;\nif |Additional Drivers| tab area is blank, then:\n|Ubuntu Software| tab: check box [x] Proprietary drivers for devices (restricted)\n[Close] button.

Some time ago I have installed Xubuntu 14.04 LTS distribution of Ubuntu.  At my university I have seen Linux configured with Windows so that they use the same of desktop. I would like to configure ubuntu to use the same desktop with windows. I don't mean to use remote desktop or change appearance of desktop. I mean exactly the same desktop in a sense of files and shortcuts. When I edit a text file in windows this affects on the same file in ubuntu desktop.

After a couple of weeks running well I am now getting messages that disk space is low. And indeed it is.  It's got just a few megabytes left.  What's using it all and how can I stop it, please?\n\nA: The first thing to check is if the Rubbish Bin / Trash folder is full - if so, empty it. \nThere are a few things you can do to find out what's using your disk space. \nUse the Gnome Partition Editor tool GParted check that the size of the partition is what you think it is. \nYou can install it from Ubuntu Software Centre (search for \"gparted\") or from a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nYou should then be able to find it in the Menu, either as \"GParted\" or \"Partition Editor\". You might need to enter your password to run it. This will show you your disk and the size of each partition. \nIf you have more than one hard disk installed, select the appropirate one at the top right of the screen.\nIf you decide to make any changes to your partitions with this tool (or any other) then make sure you back up anything you want to keep before you start. \nThere is also the Disk Usage Analyzer tool, which has the unusual name \"baobab\". If not installed by default, install via the Software Centre, or from a terminal with\nsudo apt-get install baobab \n\nThis program works better if run as root, because there are certain files not visible to normal users.

It is a choice of whether you want to install software suitable for desktop, such as a desktop environment (like Windows), or software suitable for a server, which will have no desktop environment and use a prompt (like DOS).\nIf you choose one it is still possible to alter it later.

Since icloud.com supports both POP3 and IMAP, you can configure Thunderbird to pick up mail from the icloud.com servers, and send through it. \nThis suggests deciding which you wish to use, POP3 or IMAP.

VMWare to Virtualbox can't detect the HHDs or the volumes. But if you have enough Ubuntu's HDD, don't unify, firstly install the virtual machine on Ubuntu's HDD, then, move it to the empty disk. \nBut search \"OS X Snow Leopard\" at Web UPD8 and you'll find that article.

But VMWare is another good idea. \nIf you want to use OS X 10.9... firstly you need to install OS X Snow Leopard on a virtual machine and update to 10.6.8, and at 10.6.8, download OS X 10.10 (it's free) (unfortunately OS X 10.9 isn't available).\nI recommend you to visit and ask for help at the InsanelyMac (they're good people and help a lot the people to make Hackintosh), but before, I'll give you a tip: please, don't cite iAthos and TonyMacOSX86, so that forum doesn't support them. \nGood luck!\n\nA: I saw a post in Lifehacker that shows how to do it with OS X Snow Leopard. I tested in my Ubuntu 14.04 and it worked pretty well. You have to use an OSX86 ISO and your CPU needs to support hardware virtualization, or else this will not work. Lifehacker article mentions that you'll be needing around 1 GB of RAM and that the virtual hard disk size should be around 20GB, you can use less if you don't have enough RAM / HDD space to spare.

I try to run pgadmin3 as user postgres and I get following error:\nNo protocol specified\nError: Unable to initialize gtk, is DISPLAY set properly?\n\nCommand pgadmin3 runs well under pavel (my main user account).\nThe answers of a question on this suggested either some server connection magic (not my case - I try to run it on localhost), or setting DISPLAY variable. I checked it through printenv both under pavel and postgres, and it's :0 for both. I used the trick to find which processes have DISPLAY variable set under both users. For pavel, there's very long list with the DISPLAY values :0 (for most processes, including pgadmin) or :0.0 (for some). But for postgres, there are just three or four processes in the list.\nHere's where I'm stuck: how to set an environment variable (DISPLAY, in this case) for a process? Or better, for application/user combination, so that the process would see the DISPLAY setting from the very start. I already tried to hardcode DISPLAY in ETC/ENVIRONMENT, but nothing changed - it affects the DISPLAY value where it is set (for users and processes), but not its visibility for processes run by the users.\n\nA: It sounds like you sudo'd to the postgres user then tried to run Pgadmin from there.\nDon't do that.\nRun PgAdmin as your regular user, without sudo.

I did not want to do all the stuff and want to make video without making any temp directory, or renaming clips etc..For the sake of convenience and save time for the same.\n\nA: The images have to be in a sequential order in order to create videos In avconv with images.

You can also give image file range where it can be taken from creating videos using \"-start_number\" \nNote : You will need a recent 9.x version of avconv for the -start_number option; it is not in version 0.8.x. Alternatively you could use a recent version of ffmpeg.

That means you have to crack it up manually after resume, but... \nThe command that set the volume should be something like: \npacmd set-sink-volume 0 20000\n\n(pacmd is in the package pulseaudio-utils), where the 0  is the default sink (sound output)  and the volume is a 16-bit number (from 0 to 65535); more details in this answer. You have to experiment to find the command that works for your system.\nTo make that automatic at suspend/resume time, you can use the same technique explained in this post: (I did not test it --- but it should work).\n\n\n*\n\n*edit/create the file \ngksudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/02_shush\n\n*Put  this content in it:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# set the volume low on suspend and resume.

In general my home folder is empty, it's just a fresh system installation.\n\nA: This is a classical error... it's the other way around: \nln -s Existing-file New-name \n\nso in your case \nln -sv /media/mariajulia/485f3e29-355c-4be3-b80a-1f5abd5604b6/mariajulia/Downloads/saga..doc ~/Documents/saga \n\nshould work. Note though: \n\n\n*\n\n*if ~/Documents/saga exists and is not a directory, you will have the error too; \n\n*if ~/Documents/saga exists and is a directory, the symbolic link will be ~/Documents/saga/saga..doc (are you sure about the double dot?) \n\n*if ~/Documents/saga does not exists, you symbolic link will be ~/Documents/saga (as it is, no extension). \n\nA: I have same error message\nwhen redirecting  \nln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n\nfrom node.js v0.10.25\nto node.js v4.2.3\nso I look at man ln\nand use \n[OPTION] \n-f, --force\n          remove existing destination files\n\nThis is work as I expected.\n\nA: Just to add new information, you can remove the current symlink, then re-create the symlink. \nrm  ~/Documents/saga\n\nThen re-create the symlink:\nln -sv /media/mariajulia/485f3e29-355c-4be3-b80a-1f5abd5604b6/mariajulia/Downloads/saga..doc ~/Documents/saga\n\nHope this helps anyone who still faces 'file exists' error.\n\nA: As @Rmano responded in his answer the arguments were in the wrong order. I made the same mistake pretty often too. Thus I found a\nFool-proof way to create symbolic links\nFirst go into the directory where you want to create the link\ncd ~/Documents/saga\n\nThen create the link with a single argument.\nln -s /very/long/path/to/target/Downloads/saga..doc\n\nThis will create a link to the current directory with the same name as the target.\n\nA: Might be unrelated.\nFor me the link was dead. Pointing to a non existing folder. When trying to replace it, it would fail with this message. ^\nSo a simple rm linkName was enough.\n", "Q: where does kali tools goes on?

I know this, because the tool he used to create the USB specifically says that it will install an MBR. MBR doesn't work in EFI systems. So, more than likely you had to change an EFI/BIOS setting in order to get the USB to boot in the first place. This setting is usually called Legacy Boot or CSM in the EFI setup. If Ubuntu is installed this way, then it will only boot from legacy mode and, hence, GRUB cannot boot Windows 8 -- because Windows 8 requires it to be in EFI mode (in most cases, like if the computer shipped with Windows 8). If your computer did not ship with Windows 8, then you're going to have to determine somehow whether you have EFI or not. I'm not entirely sure how to do that from Windows.\nHow do you fix this? Or, how to convert Ubuntu to EFI boot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Ubuntu\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)\n\n*sudo apt-get install grub-efi linux-signed-image-generic\n\n*Just to be sure, run the command sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot and enter the EFI setup\n\n*Change back to regular boot mode (non-Legacy/CSM)\n\n*Go ahead and set 'Ubuntu' as your boot option (under the Boot tab usually) while you're there\n\n\nAfter that, you should be up and running.\nIn the future, write the ISO directly to the USB using a tool such as dd for Windows or Win32 Disk Imager (it says it doesn't work with ISO files, but in this particular case you could rename the .iso to .img and it should work just fine).\n", "Q: How to install software from 14.10 repositories?

Back in time  displays 'saving permission...' in the bottom left corner of the GUI all the time, even when it is not being actively used. Does it always do that with other users? Is it a harmless glitch?

BIT will read the message from ~/.local/share/backintime/worker<ID>.message. Sometimes this file did not get removed correctly and BIT will keep showing that message even if there is no more snapshot running. Deleting the above file will fix this (next major version 1.1.0 will do this automatically).\n\n*if a snapshot crashed during saving permissions the raw data is already backed up and you can restore your files. You would only loose permission settings for the files. So in worst case you'd have to manually chown/chmod them. But if this happens every time we should dive in to find the problem. /var/log/syslog should normally show backintime (USER): INFO: Unlock at the end of a snapshot.\n\nWhen you say filesystem is msdos did you mean fat or ntfs? Because fat doesn't support hardlinks. This means that every new snapshot will use the full size on your disk even if the files didn't change (they are not 'incremental'). Please take a look at this FAQ to find out if your files are incremental.\nI'd really recommend using a native Linux filesystem like ext3 especially for serious stuff!\n", "Q: Replace prebuilt package with self-compiled version I need to update my Point Cloud Library (PCL) that I installed via official instructions with my own version that I just compiled according to this manual. The reason is I need to fix a bug in PCL which is present in the pre-built package that I installed originally.\nI do \"sudo make install\" as in the last step but when I compile my application the bug is still present. If I list libpcl version like this\ndpkg -l | grep '^ii' | grep libpcl\n\nit outputs 1.7+trusty1 for libpcl-all package and 1.7.1-3+trusty2 for other libpcl- packages. My compiled version shold be 1.7.2.\n\nA: In ubuntu, this manual represents a wrong way to install from source something, that exists in the library. The right one is this:\n\n*\n\n*apt-get source <package>\n\n*sudo apt-get build-dep <package>\n\n*cd <package>\n\n*dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b\n\n*dpkg -i <package>.deb\nFull instructions here\nFor kernel and libs procedure is different.\n", "Q: How to enable systemd user units in 14.10 I put a unit under ~/.config/systemd/unit:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Test systemd user enabled\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'echo afdasf > /home/joelmo/sysdworking'\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=default.target\n\nBut I don't think this is beeing run, i see no file sysdworking.

You won't need to start installing from scratch. Installing lubuntu-desktop, xubuntu-desktop or kde-desktop will suffice.\n\n*Or go back and re-install Ubuntu 12.04\n\n\nA: There are a lot of tuning tips on the web, check here:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/speed\nAnd try to improve the performance by changing the GPU driver, check the Manual from your PC wich GPU is in.\n", "Q: Error messages at bootup Running ubuntu 14:10 and the following three dialog boxes appear with errors in them.\nMy hard drive is 500gb and its a fresh install of ubuntu.\nDialog box\nError - Run Command Interface\nUnable to save bookmarks in\n/home/joseph/.kde/share/apps/kfileplaces/bookmarks.xml.\nReported error was: insufficient permissions in target directory\nThis error message will only be shown once.

When I start my computer, I have a blank screen. If I plugin my laptop to my TV, at first only the TV turns on, but the login screen shows up on my TV, and when I log in my laptop's screen is turned on, and show Unity as expected. However, If I just let Ubuntu boot without any keys pressed, or if I press shift until the GRUB menu shows up and then select the \"Ubuntu\" option, I get a blank screen. In all situations where I get a blank screen, I hear the startup sound (i.e. I hear drums playing) which indicates that X has started up, just my notebooks screen isn't turned on for some reason.

Stated that the upgrade failed. Just sat for an hour after that message and I was not able to check anything as nothing seemed to work, no keyboard, no mouse, etc. Did a hard reboot as only way to move forward. That was a MISTAKE as now nothing, the screen configuration is hosed. Only thing that happens is a message to run graphics in low mode or fix. When try to fix nothing seems to work. Rebooted and selected TTY boot version to try to see what had failed. Seems not to be able to find any user profiles and when asked for root password to proceed fails. When entering password on first and all subsequent keystrokes immediately states invalid password, enter password of Control-D; neither works...\n\nA: Boot from a live-CD or USB, take a look at the files of your hard drive after mounting the corresponding partition. \nMaybe the password file got messed up, but from what you described, much more went wrong with your upgrade, so reinstalling (if that is an option) might save you hours of troubleshooting.\n", "Q: How to create a script that will connect to a specific network Using the integrated Network Manager, I created a new VPN Connection, called 'My VPN'.

I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04 with the latest updates behind a proxy server at my school. I had no problem a few months ago. However, over the past two months when I try to add a repository with add-apt-repository there is no key retrieved. I can then use sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys KEY with success, but this is annoying. I have created scripts that add PPAs, install software, and more that are now failing because of this issue. \nShould I be filing a bug report? If so, could someone please direct me to where to file. \nHere is what my terminal output looks like when trying to add the PPA for my-weather-indicator:\n\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao\n Applications from atareao\n More info: https://launchpad.net/~atareao/+archive/ubuntu/atareao\nPress [ENTER] to continue or ctrl-c to cancel adding it\n\ngpg: keyring `/tmp/tmp16ytp9px/secring.gpg' created\ngpg: keyring `/tmp/tmp16ytp9px/pubring.gpg' created\ngpg: requesting key 36FD5529 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com\ngpgkeys: key A3D8A366869FE2DC5FFD79C36A9653F936FD5529 can't be retrieved\ngpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.\ngpg: Total number processed: 0\n\n$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 36FD5529\nExecuting: gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --homedir /tmp/tmp.fla11h2USs --no-auto-check-trustdb --trust-model always --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --primary-keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/steam.gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 36FD5529\ngpg: requesting key 36FD5529 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com\ngpg: key 36FD5529: public key \"Launchpad PPA for atareao\" imported\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)\n\nUpdate: I was able to get it working with the -E parameter for sudo, so the command that works is sudo -E add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao.

This solution comes from Ubuntu 10.10. \n\nA: You are facing two problems: \n\n\n*\n\n*add-apt-repository is relying on the existence of the correct http_proxy and https_proxy values.\n\n*sudo will not use all of the current environment values. Probably for security reasons. There are two possibilities how to overcome this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Call sudo -E add-apt-repository <additional-options>\nThis will use all of the current environment.\n\n*You can configure sudo to automatically copy http_proxy and https_proxy too.

Since then I have not been able to gain access to UBUNTU using refInd. I reinstalled refInd and also removed the logical drive. \nThe boot menu appears now, but when I try and boot into UBUNTU from the hard drive, I get 'No Bootable Drive' and when I try and boot UBUNTU from a USB stick I get 'Alloc Magic is Broken ...'. \nI'm not sure what the next step is.

When installing Ubuntu Desktop, I can automatically pull an IP address and get internet connectivity during installation.  However, if I install either Ubuntu Server 12.04 or 14.04 on the same hardware, I get a local IP address but do not have internet connectivity (cannot use apt-get or ping google).  We've tried using a static IP address, but to no avail.  I was allowed to test the hardware at my personal residence, and was able to get internet connectivity there.  \nAnyone know the reason we don't have internet connectivity with Ubuntu server but would with the Ubuntu Desktop?\n\nA: In a server, if you want a static IP address, which I recommend so that you can ssh and ftp into it, it is your responsibility to set the network details including DNS nameservers. I recommend you amend /etc/network/interfaces to something like this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback  \n\nauto eth0  \niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.125  \nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1\n\nSubstitute your details here. Be sure to select an address outside the DHCP pool in the router, switch, etc. Get the system to re-read and use the changes:\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0\n\nCheck:\nping -c3 192.168.1.1\nping -c3 www.ubuntu.com\n\n\nA: Not sure what you're doing during the installation that you don't get DHCP leased IP (I don't remember the installation process on Ubuntu Server right now out of my head) and not sure what you mean by \"I get a local IP address, but do not have internet connectivity\" - if you get proper IP from DHCP it should be fine, I'd say (have you checked routing btw?  - just in case?)\nAnyway you may try to run dhclient command manually to get IP from DHCP server - or at least try to do that (with root privileges). And then see if you get connected properly to the network.\nI guess dhclient should be installed by default, but if not - I'm pretty sure that your CD has the proper package to install.\n", "Q: Problem in Graphics with my new Ubuntu system I am new to Ubuntu and have just bought a new laptop with Ubuntu 12.04.

It shows there nvidia 331 and says \" This driver is activated but not cuurently in use\"\nRight now, I am somehow working with that incorrect resolution.

I created the fileshare by mounting one of my drives, then running\n    gksudo nautilus\nand sharing the folder using the built-in sharing function on 14.04 (this required samba to be downloaded and installed so I did that). \nThe issue is with one user on my home network. On my Windows 8 machine using the Samba user and password I set up with smbpasswd -a <user>.\nI can log in to the machine through network discovery and access the shared drive fine with read and write commands ok. However, on my Win7 machine downstairs I am able to view the folder through network discovery, I don't have the right permissions to actually open the folder or edit anything in there. This is using another samba account I created with smbpasswd -a <user>\nI've tried removing saved passwords for the server with the command net use \\\\Server /delete\nalthough that hasn't done anything except prompt me for the password again once I access the drive in the network settings.\nI have tried adding the new samba account to the smbusers (I think) group but with no changes.\nI can dump my smb.conf if someone tells me how to.\nThanks.\n\nA: I have the same Ubuntu.

The application is proprietary, so I can't even recompile it for 32-bit.\nI've read that I should be able to run a 64-bit application in 32-bit Ubuntu, if my kernel is 64-bit. From what I've read, this should work fairly smoothing with \"MultiArch\" support, which I should have in my version (14.04). But I can't figure out how to install the 64-bit kernel.\nMy processor seems to support 64-bit, because \"lm\" appears in the output of grep flags /proc/cpuinfo\nI've seen a few questions already about upgrading the entire system to 64-bit, but those all tend to boil down to \"just do a fresh install\". I want to avoid doing a fresh install, if I can: I've got a lot of configuration I don't want to find and repeat, and I've read that on my old hardware with my relatively small amount of RAM, a full 64-bit system will probably use enough extra memory that it will get bogged down.\nI've noticed that old kernel versions stick around until I remove them, so if I can install a 64-bit kernel, I assume I can boot into the 32-bit kernel again if things go wrong.\nI found a guide to upgrading a Debian system that starts with installing the 64-bit kernel[1], but the instructions therein don't work for me:\n$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture amd64\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install linux-image-amd64:amd64\n\nThe first two commands seem to complete OK, but the install command gives:\nReading package lists...

Indeed, if you search on debian.org for this package, you'll get a positive result.

In cp -r ../dhcppc0/*, cp is not handling ../dhcppc0/*. The shell expands ../dhcppc0/*, and then passes the expanded content to cp. So if it expanded into ../dhcppc0/bar, ../dhcppc0/baz, and  ../dhcppc0/foo, then the expanded command would be:\ncp -r ../dhcppc0/bar ../dhcppc0/baz ../dhcppc0/foo\n\nAnd if foo is a directory, cp will happily copy all the content of the other directories to foo. \n\n[W]hat and where is all the disk space gone? and how to I get it back? is there some temporary buffer space somewhere on the system that I can clear?\n\nDo echo  ../dhcppc0/*, look at the last name that comes up and inspect that directory.\nThis is why when copying directories or using wildcards, always use the -t paramater:\ncp -t . ../dhcppc0/*\n# or cp --target-directory . ../dhcppc0/*\n\nAnd note that you will miss out on any dot-folders and dot-files if you use *.

Windows and Ubuntu have very little in common.\nYou can try to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu, so that you don't have to reboot your computer if you do want to use Windows. For this to work, you need to install Windows inside a virtual machine, so you will need the installation disc (or any other installation method, like an ISO file).\nYou can install virtualbox by executing this:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nThen start VirtualBox, create a new virtual machine and start the installation procedure by selecting the source of the installation files (CD/DVD/USB/ISO).\n\nA: If you want to have zero time switching between both operating systems, the easiest and best way is to add an extra computer and a screen.

I am using the linux-lowlatency package as my main kernel (as the generic kernel produces horrible lags while playing audio to my bluetooth speakers).\nI regularly find that my /boot partition is full, due partly to having the generic kernel installed alongside the low latency one.

Now this Canonical signed grub can run either signed or unsigned (by Canonical) Linux kernels -- some features will not be available on the unsigned kernels at boot, but you probably won't notice.

Is there a way to find which applications have used this 20 MB of memory. Can top command be of any help in this??\n\nA: While I'm not exactly familiar with how top formatting works, I can offer a few work-arounds. \nPS\nps command is comes with procps package and is among standard utilities, that is readily available on your system. -aux switches will output processes for all users and programs on the system, while --sort %mem is used to sort output by % of memory used. \nIn short: ps -aux --sort %mem.\nHTOP\nHtop is a variation of top, but with much nicer appearance and features (at least IMHO).\nPressing F6 will allow you to sort output by whatever quality you want, again by memory, and again in percentage. \n\nSome considerations:\nAs to why would the memory be eaten up this much, you may know that a closed program doesn't always mean its process was stopped - it may actually hang around and eat up your memory. Which is where you can user htop or ps to find that process's pid, and kill it with kill command or htop build-in kill function. Try playing with a process priority levels in System Monitor program (right click on the process and hover cursor over Changer Priority). Although this is more related to CPU usage, CPU uses memory to process each command and only simpler tasks are in the internal registers (if i remember correctly from  intro to computer science class).\n\nA: Top displays the active processes, including the memory.\nSystem monitor is the user friendly (GUI) way to memory usage analysis, provided the applications are still open.\nAlso, take a note that, once memory used in a session by a program, it may be still in a buffer until it's needed by another program. From the manual:\nfree displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory\nin the system, as well as the buffers used by the kernel.\n\nSo if you close for example Firefox, that memory may be held in cache just in case you want to start Firefox again.\n", "Q: Wired network not connecting automatically after xubuntu 14.10 upgrade Last weekend I upgraded my 14.04 xubuntu to the latest release, 14.10 (out of curiosity).

Is there a way to kill a process tree using the terminal?\nBy killing a process tree, I mean killing all descendants of a process along with the process it self.\nI tagged this question htop because I am using that utility a lot these days and it would be cool if there was an easy way to kill a process tree inside htop (something better than just selecting all the processes in the subtree).\n\nA: This should help you!\npkill -TERM -P `PID`\n\n\nA: There has been a feature in htop for this for a long time, but it was missing from the manual until 2018: press the c key to select the currently highlighted process as well as all of its children. Then operations that apply to selected processes (such a killing using the k key) apply to the process and its children.\nThis isn't atomic, though. If new children are spawned between the moment you press c and the moment the kernel has killed all the processes, they won't be killed and will most likely end up being reattached to the init process. This is because htop is looping on the selected processes and killing them one by one.\nI've proposed a patch to add an atomic group-killing feature to htop a while ago, but the implementation wasn't consensual enough for it to be merged. With it, it is possible to kill a whole process group atomically from htop. That's not exactly the same as killing a whole tree, but AFAIK, the kernel doesn't provide any way to kill an arbitrary tree atomically.\n\nA: Using htop, you can use F5 to show the process tree's. \nIf you select the process at the top of the tree you want kill, then press F9 followed by Enter it will close the process and the entire process tree in one go.\nIn the screen shot below this action would cause Chrome and all sub process to be closed.\n\n\nA: Yes, this can be done by using kill, i am not sure about htop. For example, if the PGID of the processes 65,78 and 90 is 35, then you can kill them all (forcefully) by the following command:\nsudo kill -9 -35\n\ni.e.\nsudo kill -9 -<PGID>\n\nA: I tried this and it worked for me \n\n\n*\n\n*Get the PID process id by top or Htop \n(with Htop tape F4 write-the-name-of-the-process then F5 to get tree)  \n\n*use this command it worked for me  \nkill -TERM pid\n\n", "Q: Installing Energia for TI MSP430 development I am new to Ubuntu and I want to install Energia.

When I press the Unlock button I am again asked for an authorization password. How do I fix this?\n\nA: I assume you're using an administrative account. (By which I don't mean root) Then you just enter your password you supplied when you installed Ubuntu.\nIf you, however, have no administrative account and don't know the root password, you need to ask a person who owns an administrative account to give you the password or to fix this for you.\nThis whole situation comes up because user and password information is stored in files only root has access to.

Basic idea is that remainder can only be from 0 to divisor, so we get that and then offset the resulting value by the low limit. I've used this technique multiple times when writing code in C.\nOf course, this question is tagged with scripts and it is well possible to implement the same technique in bash. We can use $RANDOM variable generator and then take the integer into desired range using bc calculator. The script below does exactly that:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nget_random_int(){\n\n    echo \"$low + $RANDOM % ( $high - $low + 1  )\" | bc\n}\n\nmain(){\n    local howmany=$1\n    local low=$2\n    local high=$3\n\n    local counter=0    \n    while [ $counter -lt $howmany  ]\n    do\n        get_random_int\n        counter=$(($counter+1))\n    done\n}\n\nmain \"$@\"\n\nBasic usage:\n$ ./random_in_range.sh 3 100 200                                                                                                      \n184\n110\n179\n\nThe first argument is how many integers you want, second is low limit, and third argument is upper limit.\n", "Q: A question about the last security update for Ubuntu (\"ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change...\") I'm subscribed to the Ubuntu Security Notes, so everytime that I receive an e-mail, a new update is avalable.\nBut in the last update, they wrote something in the end that I coudn't undertand much, so can anyone please tell me what does that means?\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.\n\nI tried to ask to my friend (who also uses Linux), but he don't know much about kernel.\n\nA: Linux (the Kernel) is mainly an abstraction layer for different kinds of hardware. It's a common ground where other software can built on top, not caring whether it runs on your smart phone or on your notebook.\nThe people making that piece of software are very concerned to never ever ever break compatibility with existing software. The ABI is the bridge between the Kernel and the other software on it. They only change it if something is really badly broken or if they find a security hazard they can't fix otherwise.\nTherefore they make it quite clear once they do break the ABI behaviour somewhere.\n(This is all very funny to me, since most of the other core-software on a linux breaks compatibility to software running on it right and left.)\nAnyway, this is very unlikely to effect you as a user.\n", "Q: Ubuntu from a stick Is it posible to install Ubuntu on to a USB stick so it is self contained on that USB stick?\nLike I'm not trying to install from a USB stick, but onto a USB stick INSTEAD of a hard drive so it is a portable Ubuntu.\n\nA: A Ubuntu Live image on a USB drive works quite well.

So just like the accepted answer, if you turn off wifi/bluetooth with the hardware switch in any other operating system than ubuntu, it makes ubuntu think that these devices aren't there are boot up, and so when you turn them on, it loads the appropriate drivers.\nAnother way of achieving the same effect without having to reboot or anything would be to edit this file:\n/etc/bluetooth/main.conf, it will probably require sudo, hence:\nsudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf\nAnd then go to the bottom of the file and uncomment #AutoEnable=false and make it AutoEnable=true.\nThis essentially tells Ubuntu to load drives even for those devices that are found after booting (hence achieving the effect of a reboot with hardware switch turned off).\nOnce you save the file, simply restart the service with:\nsudo systemctl restart bluetooth.service\nAnd Bluetooth should now be working fine. \nI basically swapped my M.2 Sata chip from one computer to another computer and surprisingly enough everything worked nicely minus the wifi and bluetooth.

That should allow the process to complete, then you can do an apt-get install --reinstall ... on those packages after you're done updating to get their startup reconfigured properly.\n\nA: It sounds like you have errors in your configuration files for bind9 and wide-dhcpv6-client. If you have not manually edited those yourself (ie you are using/want to use the default DHCP/DNS client behavior), you should issue\napt-get install --reinstall bind9 wide-dhcpv6-client\n\nand when it asks you if you wish to keep your current configuration files, tell it to overwrite yours with the package maintainer's version.\nI had this issue after using do-release-upgrade to go from Trusty to Xenial.

In the Ubuntu 12.04 the Krusader works OK, so the graphics hardware has not failed.\nOn an older PC of a similar sort, in Ubuntu 12.04 the Krusader works OK:\n$ lspci -v\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82815 815 Chipset Host Bridge and Memory Controller Hub (rev 02)\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: agpgart-intel\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82815 Chipset Graphics Controller (CGC) (rev 02) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: Compaq Computer Corporation Device 001a\n    Flags: bus master, 66MHz, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 5\n    Memory at 44000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]\n    Memory at 40500000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=512K]\n    Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 PCI Bridge (rev 01) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0\n    Bus: primary=00, secondary=02, subordinate=02, sec-latency=64\n    I/O behind bridge: 00001000-00001fff\n    Memory behind bridge: 40000000-404fffff\n    Kernel modules: shpchp\n\nThis older PC wakes up OK from the \"suspend\" status, as did both the other PCs some time ago.\nNow, I see Krusader bleached on the older PC, too: I caused it by trying to look at the content of a directory while Krusader copied several GiBs from another PC.\nThe Krusader window remained white after clicking Pause, too. But another instance of Krusader worked OK at the same time. After restarting the older PC the Krusader remains bleached and another Krusader instance called from an other Terminal is bleached, too.\nFirst, I suspected my old hardware and its drivers.

Are they in the ~/.kde directory? Which file is it particularly? I'd like to delete the file only before reinstalling Krusader. I am afraid of deleting whole the directory because I have installed other KDE programs. (The KDiff3 is not bleached in the Ubuntu 14.04 of the first PC nor in the Ubuntu 12.04 of the older PC.)\n\nA: For one of my PCs, that now uses the Nvidia graphics card, the bleached Krusader starts to operate normally after setting all the the Krusader user settings to defaults. \nA good idea is to note everything that has been set. Then run the Krusader Konfigurator and for all items (Panel, General, ...) click the Default button and confirm the action. \n(At the other PC I have not seen the bleached state since I have guessed the solution, but I believe that the treatment also helps. By many attempts, I found out that the bug has something to do with settings. The whole problem may be caused by my using old CPUs not certified for Ubuntu.)  \nFor a yet older Pentium III HP Compaq using its integrated graphics only, the treatment helps, too.\n\nA: I have found that on my machine, hitting Ctrl+F (toggle full screen terminal) in krusader leads to that same completely white krusader window - and it stays that way until you hit Ctrl+F again.\nIf it happens again: give that a try.\n", "Q: Uninstall of software Sometimes when I install software using the sudo apt-get install <package> command the package may take minutes to be installed and in the end it may occupy some gb of space. If I uninstall it using sudo apt-get purge <package> then it may be uninstalled in seconds and very little space (some kb or mb) may be removed from the original that it occupied when installed! Obviously that means that this is not a clean uninstall and that my pc is full of undeleted files. Why is that happening and how should I uninstall packages cleanly and fully?\n\nA: When you install a package, it may also need to install dependencies for it to work - for instance installing torcs (e.g. with sudo apt-get install torcs), it needs torcs-data etc to work - they are also installed, and are fairly large in size (so also take time to download etc).\nWhen removing torcs (e.g. with sudo apt-get remove torcs), it will likely leave the torcs-data packages and other no longer needed packages behind, taking up space. You can solve this by running sudo apt-get autoremove <package>, or sudo apt-get autoremove after removing it with purge/remove.\nYou can also you the --purge option with autoremove to remove left over configuration files.\nAn extra way of clearing space is to use sudo apt-get clean, to clear out the repo information and cached packages which also take up space. You will likely need to run sudo apt-get update afterwards.\nHere are the relevant entries from the manual page:\n   purge\n       purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and\n       purged (any configuration files are deleted too).\n\n   clean\n       clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files.\n       It removes everything but the lock file from\n       /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. When\n       APT is used as a dselect(8) method, clean is run automatically.\n       Those who do not use dselect will likely want to run apt-get clean\n       from time to time to free up disk space.\n\n   autoremove\n       autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically\n       installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no\n       more needed.\n\n", "Q: Unable to connect to server on internal network I have an Ubuntu server hosting a web server and various other things.

Same thing if I am not connected to my home network at all, it's almost instant and works perfectly.

I've tried installing Ubuntu several times as a standalone OS on my Toshiba Portege z935 which has a UEFI Bios and came pre-installed with windows 8 and it does not work. Is it really only possible to dual boot with Windows 8?\n\nA: Fedora and Windows install a file called \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTx64.EFI (x64 is the architecture and can be something like ARM too) in the EFI System Partition (ESP) which allows to boot an application or operating system when the NVRAM entries (storage on the mainboard) to boot a certain OS are not available or missing. Ubuntu currently doesn't provide such a file, which results in a non-bootable installation in these cases.\nYou can follow these instructions which install and configure Gummiboot for such scenarios. You can even configure this for secure boot. I already filed a bug, but it doesn't seem to get taken seriously.\n", "Q: Can't print correctly to Brother HL-2140 laser printer from Ubuntu 14.04 I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and connected to Cups which found my Brother HL-2140 printer. I then printed a test page and the printer began putting out an endless amount of blank pages. Turned the printer off and tried to print from Firefox. Did the same thing - printed an endless amount of blank pages. This printer was previously working with Xubuntu 12.04. \nIs there a driver I need to download or something else I have to do to get it to work correctly?\n\nA: I have a HL-2240 and had a similar problem. Brother has an Install Tool here, you might have better luck selecting HL2170W instead of HL2140 though. The install directions pop up after you accept the EULA to download.\n\nA: I know this question is from a long time ago. But I got the Brother HL-2140 to work on Ubuntu by doing the following:\n(1) Add the Printer Normally (If not already added) : Plug the printer into your computer with the USB. Go to printers and add the printer normally.\n(2) Change driver : Double click on the Brother printer to open properties. ( Image of printer properties ) Click the \"Change\" button beside \"Make and Model\". Select \"Brother\" (if not already selected) and then click \"Forward\". (Change Driver Window) Select a driver other than the \"Foomatic/Postcript\" (or the current driver). I selected the \"Footmatic/hl1250 [en]\" Driver.\n(3) Existing Settings: On this page I selected \"Try to copy the option settings over from old PPD\" and clicked apply. Print a test page. If you still get continues blank pages, change the driver and try again. This method worked for me on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (32-bit).\n", "Q: Is there a way to upgrade from a CD? Is there a way to upgrade Ubuntu from a CD rather than across the network? As it stands now the only thing I know how to do from a CD is a clean install, which wipes everything on the partition.\n\nA: Yes, the 14.04 .iso now has an \"upgrade existing\" option. However, it still requires a network connection.\nAlways backup your files. Also, as far as I know, you will keep all the stuff in your home folder so that includes allot of your settings but you might need to reinstall some of the non standard apps.\nI just checked out 14.10 studio and didn't see that option, however, all you have to do is choose \"something else\". Then, select the Ubuntu partition, select ext4, mount point \"/\" and DO NOT place a check mark to format the partition.

This is done to prevent that your /boot directory and your GRUB boot menu don't get cluttered of unused kernel images.

I decided to try out the new windows 8 (then 8.1) when buying a new computer to be able to run microsoft software cleanly. I still installed ubuntu as a dual-boot system (splitting my drive's space 50/50). Now I want to re-install ubuntu and to get completely rid of windows (and never look back). Now, that isn't much of a problem. My question is simple:\nIf I decide to install ubuntu once again, and extending the installation to the entire hard drive (if that is still possible), would my partitions (that have been divided previously for the dual-boot) \"fuse\" back together? Meaning firstly that I'd get all of my hard drive space back on ubuntu. \nTechnically, I'd say yes. But most of the questions ask how to delete one OS while keeping the other boot. I want to know if I can do that while taking a simpler, more direct way or if I have to go through deleting the OS before reinstalling ubuntu anyway. I haven't even looked at what I can do with my grub repair for that matter, and I am pretty sure it can do what I want through another way. Yet, I find that format-installing ubuntu is the 1) simplest, 2) easiest, but also 3) the most complete/reassuring way to erase my dual-boot system.\nI'm clearly not an ubuntu guru.\n\nA: Well, if you want just Ubuntu on your hard disk and nothing else, you can do that during installation or you could just delete the Windows installation.\nTo erase the entire disk and install Ubuntu, just select Erase and use entire disk when you boot from your Ubuntu CD / USB stick.\nA standard installation guide is given here.\n", "Q: Why does e-cryptfs keep filling up /tmp?

So any ideas on how to get this info on Gnome machines?\n\nA: Found out that /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence contains the current status of the user session.\nIt can be called by this:\ngdbus call -e -d org.gnome.SessionManager -o /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence -m org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence status\n\nQuick bash test:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n echo \"PRESENCE \"\ngdbus call -e -d org.gnome.SessionManager -o /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence -m org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence status\n        echo -e \"\\n\"\n        sleep 1\ndone\n\nFor example in Qt:\nQProcess process;\nprocess.start(\"sh\", QStringList() << \"-c\"<< \"gdbus call -e -d org.gnome.SessionManager -o /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence -m org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence status\");\nprocess.waitForFinished();\nresult = QString::fromLatin1(process.readAllStandardOutput());\nint state = result.remove(\"(<uint32 \").remove(\">,)\").toInt();\nif(state != 0) {\n    // user not active!\n}\n\n\nA: Above answer returns an error on Ubuntu 18.04 because the call wants dots instead of slashes.  Including error output for future searches:\nError calling:\n$ gdbus call -e -d org.gnome.SessionManager -o /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence -m org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence ss\nError: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.InvalidArgs: No such interface '/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence'\n(According to introspection data, you need to pass 'ss')\n\nExample of working syntax:\n$ gdbus call -e -d org.gnome.SessionManager -o /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence -m org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence status\n(<uint32 0>,)\n\nOutput when locked:\n$ sleep 10; gdbus call -e -d org.gnome.SessionManager -o /org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence -m org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence status\n(<uint32 3>,)\n\nDocs https://people.gnome.org/~mccann/gnome-session/docs/gnome-session.html#org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence\n", "Q: Replace Windows 8.1 with Ubuntu Keeping Data in Different Partition I have already searched to replace Windows with Ubuntu, I got it. The question I have right now in my mind is, is it possible to keep data in different partition and install ubuntu in windows partition.\nSuppose,\nI have 3 partitions of 500GB HDD,\nC - Windows Installed, D - Local Data, E - Local Data,\nI want to keep the data of D & E drive as it is, and want to install ubuntu in C without any error.\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes this is possible.\nDuring the installation select the C:\\ drive for th einstallation, the other two partitions will be left allone.\n\nA: What you are asking is possible. I believe you'll have to select manual partitioning during the installation.\nAll your three partitions will most likely show up as 'NTFS' partitions, but they won't have their drive letters from Windows. You can however see their disk labels.\nDuring the manual partitioning, for your 'root' partition (mount point in /) select the partition which matches the label of your C drive (if it does not have a label, the one that maches the size).\nIf you'd like to access the data partitions from Ubuntu too, you will have to select a mount point for those. This can be anything you desire, but make sure that the 'format' checkbox isn't marked.\n", "Q: Rename multiple files whose names include '*' I have a set of files whose names contain the character *. For Example, a file name could be ***abcdef. I want to change this file name to 3_abcdef, replacing the * with the number of * that were there. \nI have a script to rename multiple files, but I don't know how to change that script to do the above task. \nThis is wjat I have so far:\nfind drp/ -depth -name \"*abc.tab\" -exec rename 's/\\abc.tab$/xyz.tab/' {} +\n\nHow can I adapt it to this task?\n\nA: You can use an actual expression with rename. In this case we match as many asterisks as there are, and then replace that with the length of the match:\nrename 's/^[*]+/sprintf(\"%d_\", length $&)/e' -vn *\n\nIf that looks right, remove the -n argument. That's just there to allow you to test it safely.\nHere's my test harness:\n$ touch \\*{,\\*{,\\*}}abc.tab\n$ rename 's/^[*]+/sprintf(\"%d_\", length $&)/e' -vn *\n***abc.tab renamed as 3_abc.tab\n**abc.tab renamed as 2_abc.tab\n*abc.tab renamed as 1_abc.tab\n\nIf you also want to do another rename, you can chain it in:\n$ rename 's/^[*]+/sprintf(\"%d_\", length $&)/e; s/abc/xyz/' -vn *\n***abc.tab renamed as 3_xyz.tab\n**abc.tab renamed as 2_xyz.tab\n*abc.tab renamed as 1_xyz.tab\n\n\nA: Assuming you'd like to replace the number of preceding \"*\" by the actual number (like in your example), and taking into account the possibility of the existance of sub folders and ignoring invisible files, a python option would be:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\nsourcedir = sys.argv[1]\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(sourcedir):\n    for name in files:\n        if not name.startswith(\".\") and name.count(\"*\") != 0:\n            number = name.count(\"*\"); newname = str(number)+\"_\"+name.replace(\"*\", \"\")\n            shutil.move(root+\"/\"+name, root+\"/\"+newname)\n\nCopy it into an empty file, save it as rename.py, run it by the command:\npython3 path/to/rename.py </path/to/files>\n\nit renames\n****banana.txt\n**monkey.mp3\n**************test\n\ninto:\n4_banana.txt\n2_monkey.mp3\n14_test\n\n\nA: Incase if you need a one liner bash script.\n$ find . -type f -exec bash -c 'file=$(basename \"$0\"); rn=$(echo \"$file\"|grep -o \"*\"|wc -l); on=$(echo \"$file\"|tr -d \"*\"); mv \"$file\" \"${rn}_${on}\"' {} \\;\n\n$ ls \n0_a.txt  1_a.txt  2_a.txt  3_a.txt\n\nAnd if you need a shell script.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nchanged=0\n\nfor file in *\ndo\n    rn=$(echo \"$file\"|grep -o '*'| wc -l)\n    on=$(echo \"$file\"|tr -d '*')\n    if [ \"$rn\" -ne 0 ]\n    then\n        mv -v \"$file\" \"$rn\"_\"$on\"\n        ((changed++))\n    fi\ndone\n\nif [ $changed -gt 0 ]\nthen\n    echo \"Have renamed $changed files\"\nelse\n    echo \"There are no files to rename\"\nfi\n\nOutput\n$ ./a.sh \n`***a.txt' -> `3_a.txt'\n`**a.txt' -> `2_a.txt'\n`******b.txt' -> `6_b.txt'\n`**b.txt' -> `2_b.txt'\nHave renamed 4 files\n\nI would recommend to use shell script as it has more validations.\n", "Q: How to verify Swap area functioning?

So I have to always go \nto the 'Gmail/All Mail' and 'Gmail/Important' folders  to mark folder as read every-time I get a new mail.\nHow can I remove the 'Gmail/All Mail' and \n'Gmail/Important' folders in Thunderbird \n(obviously without deleting the content of \n'Inbox')? Is this something that can be fixed \nfrom within Thunderbird, or do I have to change \nsomething on the webmail side?\n\nA: Unsubscribing the \"important\" folder can resolve the issue.\nThis can be done by right-clicking any folder in the inboxes panel and clicking \"Subscribe...\". That will load all folders Thunderbird is currently watching, and you can untick the box to unsubscribe from \"Important\".\nYou can find further information on imap folders and subscription in this superuser quesion: What does it mean to “subscribe” to an IMAP folder?\n\nA: The answers above no longer work for T'bird 68.10.0.  The trick is to click on the account name -> Manage folder subscriptions -> select the folder you don't want and uncheck its box.  The Important and All Mail folders are under [Gmail].\nEven easier is to right click on the account name -> click on Subscribe..., then as above.\n\nA: You can also tell gmail itself to not present the relevant folders to the IMAP user (thunderbird) at all. To do this, go to Gmail > Settings > Labels, find the relevant labels, and untick \"Show in IMAP\".\n", "Q: json_object_iterator.h not Found I am trying to parse JSON object from C program. but i got following error.\nmy c program contains json/json.h header file. this header file is causing below error.

Each time I am opening the application Intel Graphics Installer, and attempting to install it I am getting the following error:\nEnsuring consistent system... OKListing packages... OK\nSetting up repositories... OK\nInstalling packages...\nUpdating package cache... Failed\n\nWith the following error\n\nW:GPG error: https://download.01.org trusty Release: The following signatures were invalid: BADSIG A902DDA375E52366 Rodrigo Vivi (Intel Linux Graphics) <rodrigo.vivi@intel.com>, W:Failed to fetch \n, E:Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\n\nA: To be able to download the graphic driver from Intel, you have to add their GPG keys to your system.  Ubuntu will otherwise be unable to validate that the files are correct.\nTo add the keys, open a terminal window and enter something like this:\nwget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg \\\n      -O - | sudo apt-key add -\n\nor\nwget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg-2 \\\n     -O - | sudo apt-key add -\n\nNote Intel seem to update their GPG keys regularly, and their instructions do not get updated as often leading to forum posts complaining. However, if you don't mind guesses, you'll note that the difference between the two keys above is -2 appended to the URL. For 16.04's packages at least as of 14 Oct 2016, Intel are on -4. My bet is that the next one's likely to be -5!\n", "Q: Webcam not working nor detected I recently bought Acer Aspire E3-111-C10N (8GB version), and to my surprise webcam is not working.\nlspci:\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series SoC Transaction Register (rev 0e)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Graphics & Display (rev 0e)\n00:13.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Device 0f23 (rev 0e)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series USB xHCI (rev 0e)\n00:1a.0 Encryption controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Trusted Execution Engine (rev 0e)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series High Definition Audio Controller (rev 0e)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device 0f48 (rev 0e)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device 0f4a (rev 0e)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device 0f4c (rev 0e)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Power Control Unit (rev 0e)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation Device 0f12 (rev 0e)\n02:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9565 / AR9565 Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

What it told me is an attempt to configure apt to install additional packages from CD failed. What I did is I clicked OK, then it told me installation complete, restart now. But when it was restarting, it then told me that ...No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found!. Is it that my PC is not among the list of Linux-supported laptops? If it is not, what is that list?\n\nA: It seems that your CD has been incompletely written or improperly burnt. When the installation process is going on, after the partitions are filled with files, there is a step where it checks for your internet connection. If you have one, it will get the updated files from the internet. Else, it would install the locally available files from the CD. It seems that your CD cannot provide these files which means that it is improperly written. Alternately, you can try writing the CD to a pen drive and boot it from there. \n\nA: It seems that the installation stopped before it was complete. This can be caused by a defective installation medium. Please try to reinstall Ubuntu with a new installation medium.\nThis basically means that you will have to recreate/reprepare a new CD/DVD drive or USB stick with a freshly downloaded Ubuntu distribution on it.\nAlso see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto to verify your downloaded ISO file.\n\nA: Just about any laptop can run Linux, period. Linux is a very versatile operating system/kernel, and it has native support for most, if not all, hardware. It's just a matter of how well-suited your laptop is for the Linux distribution you're planning to run. In my experience, the latest versions of Ubuntu do not run very well on single-core PCs with less than 2GB of RAM. (My personal hardware recommendations include an Intel Pentium 4 processor (hyperthreaded if allowed by BIOS) or newer (64-bit dual-core or quad-core CPUs work best), 2GB RAM (but 4GB is recommended), and an AMD or NVIDIA graphics card. Your laptop seems to meet the  minimum requirements (or at least my recommended requirements), so no need to worry about that.\nI'd like to address a possible issue, however. The CD image you downloaded may have had errors when burned to the disc. I'd suggest re-downloading the image and burning another disc, with a low speed and error prevention/detection if applicable. That should reduce any problems. If you still are receiving this error, reply and we'll figure it out.\n", "Q: Is there a way to automatically assign new users a disk quota limit as they are created on edubuntu? I am new to ubuntu, I recently set up an edubuntu ltsp 14.04 server. I manually assigned disk quota limit to already existing users. Is there a way to make the server automatically assign quota limit to new users as they are being created? maybe a script or something? \nHelp is really needed here...\n\nA: Actually, you can have this set.  Edit /etc/adduser.conf and add 'QUOTAUSER={user}' where {user} is set to either a user that you want to clone quota settings from, or a generic account with quota defined.  See 'man adduser.conf' for more info.\n\nA: Instead of assigning the quota to every user you could assign the quota to a group.\nThen simply add the new users to this group when you create them.\n", "Q: aftr installing ubuntu windows installation is gone I've installed the new version of ubuntu on my laptop and I choose to create new partion in my drive.

I was able to installed it thinking it will run alongside with my windows, after I restarted my pc for me to check if my windows is still there It automatically load ubuntu, is there any way that I can locate back my windows drive.\nThank,\nBadfish\n\nA: Download and burn to CD/DVD a software called -- Boot-Repair-Disk --  from SOURCEFORGE.net. After burning, insert disk into CD/DVD drive and reboot system into CD/DVD drive, click on -- recommended repair -- and let the software do its MAGIC, and then reboot system. This solves the majority of bootsector/grub/and MBR problems.  I personaly dual boot windows/ubuntu and I also use a lot of other linux flavors and sometimes GRUB gets messed up, and this has always solved my problem. Anyone using linux or dual booting linux with windows should have this simple tool it works GREAT :-)\n"]
