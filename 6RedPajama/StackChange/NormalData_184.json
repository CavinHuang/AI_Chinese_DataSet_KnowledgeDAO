["Q: What are the software updated when I updated through the default software updater gui? Automatically the ubuntu asks for its users to update the latest updates, but all the time I am unaware what gets updated.  How am I supposed to know what are the updates installed? how can I manage the updates and install knowing my necessity?\n\nA: You can check what apt did in the log file:\n/var/log/apt/history.log\n\nThe software updater tells you what it is about to update when it asks for your permission to do so. You can check there what you want to update and what not.\n\nA: The software updater dialog has a \"Details of updates\" section.  If you click on this, you can see a list of the software that will be updated as part of this.  You can also check/uncheck software.\nYou can also see this list via the commandline using\nsudo apt-get upgrade --dry-run\n\n\n", "Q: What BigTIFF capable image viewers are there for Ubuntu?

I don't think the older entry should still be there. I need to remove the old one. How am I supposed to do so?\n\nA: It appears that the grub configuration file was not correctly generated.\nYou shouldn't need to re-install grub, but the command to do so is:\nsudo apt-get grub-install /dev/sda\n\nYou definitely need to update the grub configuration:\nsudo apt-get update-grub\n\nThis should remove the old entry. \nIf it does not, you may have old kernels still in /boot.

I had windows 7 on my hard drive, then I installed Ubuntu 14.04 to dual boot (I have several partitions and ubuntu is working fine). But I don't know how to switch between the two in boot time. I read a menu for me to choose should appear at boot time, but it justs boots up to ubuntu without asking me...\nI know I didn't wipe my hard drive by accident because I can see my windows files from ubuntu.\nSo how do I switch between the two? Is there a button I should press or a setting I should turn on?\n\nA: You could try this to see if it helps.\nIt could be that the GRUB timeout is 0 seconds so you don't see it at all. \nOpen up a terminal or type in the dash:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nYou will be prompted to type your password and after that a text file will open inside the terminal.\nTry changing:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\nto\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=X (however many seconds you want)\nthen save the file and exit.

I have attempted the steps in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pycurl/+bug/926548 but this is not working; the dpkg-source command fails because pycurl_7.19.0-ubuntu3.dsc does not exist. \nI have tried removing and reinstalling a number of packages, including git, curl, libcurl3-gnutls, and libcurl4-openssl-dev with no change - git clone still fails with this same error. \nAt this point, I mostly care about restoring the use of git clone (and whatever other functions will ultimately fail because of the underlying issue). \n\nA: I had the same problem and had to recompile git against libcurl-openssl-v4 instead of gnutls. It might have something to do with the route to the git server and gnutls not liking something about it.\nThere's a PREVIOUS step by step solution on how to do just this posted on this site but I do have a couple of things I did differently and some issues I ran into.\nFirstly I don't suggest using dpkg -i as the method to install the package, use gdebi from the gdebi-core package because it allows you to install a package and its dependencies.\nMost importantly one thing that is not mentioned in that solution is that MULTIPLE *.deb packages will be produced, hence the reason to use gdebi-core.\nSecondly and lastly make sure to install the git-man package first and THEN install the main package and its dependencies, for some reason the main package listed on that solution won't install with either dpkg or gdebi without installing the manual first.\n", "Q: pptpd connects but no data I have setup pptp on my vps using this tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PPTPServer\nNo issues there.

If multiple jobs have the same \"start on\" condition,\n  Upstart will start those jobs ''in parallel''.\n\nUpstart init start/stop service based on event, this is why:\n\nAs a general rule, you cannot rely upon the the order in which events\n  will be emitted. Your system is dynamic and Upstart responds to\n  changes as-and-when they occur (for example hot-plug events).\n\n", "Q: Shell script exits without evaluating if condition I have the following commands in my shell script\n#This line basically builds a source library\n$BUILD_CMD $CONFIGFILES/$1.prj $BUILDFILESPATH \n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ];then\n   echo \"Build success\\n\"\n   #do something here\nelse\n   echo \"Build Failure\\n\"\n   #do something else here\nfi\n\nThe build fails, however, the if condition is not evaluated and it does not echo a \"Build Failure.\" The script just exits after the build command line.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: It's possible the building option fails but the python script do not return an error code. \nSo you need to use the  sys.exit() method in the python script.

Can you \"fix\" chrome's close, minimize, maximize buttons so they are on the left, and use ubuntu's theme?\nI might actually use chrome then.\n\nA: The problem with @Jbuch14 answer is that it adds an extra bar on top of everything, so it's not a real solution. I dont want any extra bars, I just want Chrome's own buttons to be at right side. How to do it?\nedit: Ok I figured it out! Instead of enabling \"use system title bar...\", you DISABLE it, and then run command\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout --type string \":minimize,,maximize,close\"\n\nand voila! No double top bar, and buttons are Windows-style at right.\n\nA: I believe there is an option to use \"System title bars\" under the settings on the \"Hamburger Menu\" on the upper-right hand corner in Chrome. Navigate to settings, the same screen where you would select for chrome to use the GTK+ theme, and the setting is in there.\nAs shown in this picture: \n\n\nA: Chrome and Ubuntu (Unity) uses different setting for positioning the window controls. Though Chrome popups always uses the system bars.\n\nFor Chrome controls: using gconf-editor create/edit the key button_layout under /apps/metacity/general with value close,minimize,maximize:\n\nFor system controls: using dconf-editor create/edit the key button-layout under org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences with value close,minimize,maximize:\nNote: works from 12.04 until 13.10, since 14.04 you can't change window controls side as stated in this answer.\n\nTo use Ubuntu theme use the options under Appearance in Chrome settings as pointed by @Jbuch14. When using system bars you are subjected to the note above.\n", "Q: Incremental history searching I found this very useful tip in UsingTheTerminal to use the arrow keys to search through the command history:\n\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward\n\"\\e[C\": forward-char\n\"\\e[D\": backward-char\n\nHow can I change it in order to use Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N instead of the arrow keys? \n\nA: Repeating what I said in comment section to not leave question hanging without answer, in order to bind one of Bash readline commands you can use bind command. For example, Crtl+N shortcut can be used with:\n$ bind '\"\\C-n\": history-search-backward'\n\nThis will be limited to current session and needs to be placed inside .bashrc to have it established in every one.\nExpanding my answer, you can also modify ~/.inputrc file, as mentioned in link provided in question. There are two ways to do this. First syntax for same shortcut as above is:\n\"\\C-n\": history-search-backward\n\nAnd the second one is:\nControl-n: history-search-backward\n\nThis second type of syntax can be used with bind as well:\n$ bind 'Control-n: history-search-backward'\n\n", "Q: pgAdmin show object browser text white on white with dark theme When using a dark theme, the object browser uses white background.

You may also try apt-get update && apt-get upgrade\n\nA: This is me trying to make a somewhat more clear answer based on @EhudBottaro's answer, and I am in no way saying this is my fix, I am just clarifying.\nIt seems that you have removed the package of network-manager from Ubuntu, which honestly, I have done before. At first it can be scary and then stressful trying to figure out how to get it back but it is easy and simple to fix (AS LONG AS YOU ARE CURRENTLY CONNECTED TO A NETWORK.) If you are, do\nsudo apt-get purge network-manager && sudo apt-get clean\n\nThat will 100% purge all files and packages related to network-manager, and you may  want to do a \nsudo proccess reload network-manager\n\n(If that ^^ Is not the right command feel free to edit, as I do not remember it exactly) Once that it done do:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install network-manager ubuntu-desktop\n\nSo that you can try to fix all missing packages.

Any ideas as to why there is a discrepancy and how I can figure out just how much work I'm putting the old machine through?\n\nA: The snapshots that these tools give you are useful when you are monitoring them, but really you need something that tracks over a little more time.  They are only taking time slices and will report spikes in applications (such as THEMSELVES) which are red herrings.\nI notice you have a web server running, is the machine serving many users?  Is it possible to start the machine without running any graphical programs and then just monitor 'top' via a tty (i.e. cntrl-alt-F10)?  That might take the UI pieces out of the equation at least.\nAlternatively you could try shutting down apache and seeing if the machine load is a little more stable.\nI'd stick to 1 process monitoring tool (certainly at a time) so that you don't see them all reporting on each other.\n\nA: I think that at least top and System Monitor are being consistent. Look at the load averages: they are consistently above 2, and given that you have a dual-core system, that means both of your CPU cores are being fully utilized over the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes respectively. This is also shown by the System Monitor CPU usage graph. As for the rest, the actual utilization of a CPU by a given set of processes is very, very volatile - they can differ from one instant to another unless there's something guiding the scheduler, like a hungry process with a high nice value.\n", "Q: How to run a cron job as a specific user?

I have a server that has been compromised, where the logs have been blown out and I have neither the ability nor the time to discover what actual pieces of the system were modified. The server was taken offline, and about 400 gigs of research data from multiple users was pulled onto another offline backup. I've scanned the directories with Clam, but am concerned that there may be remnants of malicious code dropped somewhere in the thousands of files.\nThe files represent years of data logging, but I have no backups against which I could compare them (This penetration was the first I was told about these servers \"under my control\", and some serious changes are coming), nor knowledge of what should/shouldn't be contained within. Is there some more thorough method for assuring that the data does not contain dormant pieces of malicious code? I can attempt to prevent scripts from executing from within my backup directories, but I'm assuming at some point one of the users will wonder why some code they wrote 2 years ago isn't working and will wind up undoing any security I add.\nTL;DR: I've been owned. How do I make sure that the data I am copying over to the fresh server installation will not contain potentially malicious code?\n\nA: Newbie answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount with the noexec option so executables and libraries can't run at all (scripts can't run either, but they can still be invoked with bash malicious.sh).\n\n\nOr\n\n\n*\n\n*setup some kind of safe chroot environment so you don't mind blowing the entire \"system\" when a virus tries to nuke you, à la honeypot.\n\n\nOption 1 has the obvious drawback you can't run any legit code, option 2 has the obvious drawback one single misbehaving executable can nuke all your legit data.\nIn addition, a good permission design (users, groups, sticky bit, setuid bit, etc.) and a restrictive umask should guarantee that a user is only able to blown up its own files (or in his responsibility), which is better than a complete destruction in case of attack.\nYou can also use a filesystem with snapshot support (I won't advertise ZFS too much, it has good things and bad things, you can give it a try). This won't prevent an escalation privilege attack gaining root and deleting your snapshots, but if it's just destruction of data, you can revert back to a previous state).\n", "Q: Laptop hangs on exit of suspend mode when using Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS? I have an Asus S56CA Laptop that is using Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS as a sole Operating System. Previous to this I was using Ubuntu 14.04 and had lots of unwanted documents, images, videos etc and also had picked up a few viruses. I decided the easiest way to go about resolving this issue was to do a complete clean install of Ubuntu. I downloaded the Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS ISO (64 bit) from here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop and created a bootable USB using the 'Startup Disk Creator' tool that comes pre-installed with Ubuntu on a brand-new 8 gigabyte USB. I then booted from this, installed the OS and installed the latest updates  with no issues. However, the only issue I have noticed is that my laptop will not wake from suspend. (Please Note that this was an issue present on the laptop before the clean install but I thought it was down to one of said viruses.) I know that this is a known issue but I though that this would have been fixed folllowing the latest updates. Does anyone know any way around these issues? \nEDIT: \nI should have mentioned that:\n- Upon opening the lid/clicking the power button once to resume from suspend:\nAll is can see is a blank, black screen with my cursor which cannot be moved. No key provides a response apart from the power key to preform a hard reset.\n-Using the Terminal to suspend and resume:\nIf I were to use the command sudo pm-suspend the laptop will suspend and resume before showing me the screen which I had entered the command on (shows the terminal and any other windows that were currently visible when command was executed) but I cannot interact with this in any way. Again, the only button that responds is the power key in order to preform a hard reset.\nPREVIOUS FIXES ATTEMPTS\nI have tried using a script that made the graphics card do a reboot (Using chvt1 and chvt7 I believe) but this just made the laptop unable to suspend at all. I have also tried using the fix mentioned here: Unable to resume after suspend but reached the area where it stated 'FAIL'. I tried using the code provided but it returns: \nbash: /var/log/pm-suspend.log: Permission denied\n\n\nA: I have this issue also. I wake my computer up, unlock it, and it hangs. I don't know how to fix it, I just reboot the computer. I know that if you don't require a password after sleep, it wakes just fine.\n", "Q: Need advice on size of Root Partition for latest Ubuntu or Ubuntu clone distro? I have two Hard Drives a Samsung 750Gigs and a Western Digital Green 2 TB.\nMy current partition scheme consists of only 3 NTFS partitions:\n750:\n   C: 75 Gigs  Windows 7 Home Premium\n   D: 675 Gigs for Games and other stuff\n2000:\n   E: 2 TB for remaining storage\nand 4Gigs of RAM\nI plan to dual boot Linux Ubuntu or a similar flavor of it (I assume they mostly have the space requirements)\nMy Question is mainly about the size of the Root partition and maybe also the SWAP partition.\nI plan to install a  root  swap and home partition on the 2 TB hard drive and leave the other HDD for windows 7 and windows games. But, I am slowly transitioning to Linux, hopefully completely and want to know how large should be the root partition if I plan to install a lot of software and Linux games from the repositories and maybe sourceforge and other sources so I would not need to resize the root in the foreseeable future ? \nthank you in advance.\n\nA: I would give 40-50GB for / and mabey 100GB for /home with the rest as an NTFS volume for movies/music/whatever so you can get to it from either OS.

So I used chrome.\nIn chrome I was able to allow flash to access my webcam but still doesn't work.\nPS The cam works on cheese booth without an problem, and am using Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: Flash is now phased out of chrome.  To fix a USB camera permissions problem (the camera wasn't working in Chrome), I ended up doing this:\nsudo chmod g+rw /dev/video0\nMore detail here:\nhttps://dmaiorino.com/?p=12\n\nA: It's probably a permissions problem.  Try adding your account to the video and audio groups under manage groups.\nAlso, check if you are running Chrome as an un-privileged account (rather than your own account). If you are, you'll need to add that user to video and audio groups, also. \n", "Q: Problem With Unetbootin (Or, Perhaps, Me) As I mentioned before, I'm having a lot of stability issues on Lubuntu 13, so I'm trying to upgrade to the alternate install of Lubuntu 14.04, as my computer has about 500MB RAM. \nI went to UNetbootin as I usually do, but this time around in creating the USB, I got a strange screen that said \"UNetbootin\", and within the box was a statement saying \"Hit tab to edit options\" or something like that. \nThe weird part is that on the bottom there was a timer ticking down when it'll automatically reboot, but every time it reaches zero it simply starts over again, indefinitely. If I do hit tab, it puts me in a \"boot:\" prompt, I think, and whatever I enter, it simply says it can't kind the kernel image. \nI've never had this kind of trouble with UNetbootin, so I don't know what to make of it. So far I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reformatting the USB and making sure it's FAT\n\n*Upgrading to the latest version of UNetbootin\n\n*Doing an md5sum on the .iso to verify that it's not broken (it isn't) \n\n*Fooling with the memory value on the UNetbootin command box, to see if having a value originally set at zero was the problem \n\n\nI've spent quite some hours deleting files, rebooting over and over again, and so on, so right now I'm at a loss as to how to progress further. \nAny input would be much appreciated.\nEDIT: I also must mention that due to connection problems, I had to get a friend put the alternate .iso on a flashdrive for me, so I'm pretty much stuck with installing it or of getting an ultra-small system like Puppy Linux. It's just not feasible for me to download another .iso. Plus, I'd like to stick with the alternate install, for while my computer might be able to handle the standard edition, due to all the screwups, CPU freezes, and whatnot I'd just like to try a hardware friendlier version. \nEDIT2: I'm exploring, doing trial and error, and whathave you, and I'd also like to mention that I did do an md5sum (if I wrote that correctly) to verify that the file is complete and not corrupted.\n\nA: I've given up on unetbootin. I download the .iso to my home directory and use dd.\nIn a terminal window, you'd type sudo dd if=inputfile.iso of=/dev/sd* bs=1M where inputfile.iso is your lubuntu iso, /dev/sdc is the usb thumb drive and /dev/sdc is the device your usb thumb drive is. Get the if and of right, because dd will overwrite stuff in a flash.\n\nA: The issue is that you're trying to use the alternate install ISO - UNetbootin only supports creating bootable USBs of the standard (-desktop) ISO at this time. 500MB is enough RAM to boot and install from the standard Lubuntu ISO.\n\nA: This is a known bug.\nThe fix is to update from ppa:gezakovacs/ppa.\nIt appears that this might not always work for Ubuntu 18.04.\nIn that case the fix is to run it like this: \nsudo QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 unetbootin\n\n\nA: If you already have the ISO on your computer, making a bootable flash drive with Unetbootin is relatively easy.\nOpen Unetbootin.  Select Disk Image and then the location on your computer.  After that select OK and sit back and wait the 20 minutes or so to create your bootable flash drive.\nWith 500 MBs of RAM you should not have any problem with the standard Lubuntu install in lieu of the alternate install\n\nA: I had similar issues with Unetbootin, today in fact.  If you look around Linux sites you'll see many references to issues with this tool.  Today I used the Universal USB Installer from this site:\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nand I got a clean Live CD run on Ubuntu whereas earlier today I had the exact issue you describe (when I used Unetbootin).\n(edit: This is a Windows tool.  They make a Linux one here\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/\nbut I did not try it since I created my USB on a Windows machine.)\n\nA: Well I have been using Xubuntu 14.04 LTS with latest kernel upadets etc. Recently I tried to make different Live USB distros by Unetbootin and each time failed after tried to boot from USB in the BIOS.\nWhen I do exactly same procedure with Windows based Rufus software I had no issue at all.

The reason is that graphics card manufacturers don't make adequate drivers for Linux (because it is not profitable). You better leave your system dual-boot. Play games in Windows and do other things in Xubuntu. Although 2D games should work well in Xubuntu.\n", "Q: Wireless drivers & lack of packages?

Then i cloned the Ubuntu VM as another VM. Then, I modified Network of both VMs by adding adapter# 2 with Host-only option and also enabled the DHCP Server option under Host-only networks in the VirtualBox manager Preferences.\nThen, I started both Ubuntu VM and updated below things on both VMs.\nFor First VM, \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /erc/network/interfaces\nAdded the below lines and saved,\nauto eth1\n\niface eth1 inet static\n\naddress 192.168.56.101 <--- Used 192.168.56.102 for 2nd VM\n\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/hosts\nAdded the below lines after the line 127.0.0.1 localhost and \ndeleted the line 127.0.1.1 my-laptop,\n192.168.56.101    Node1\n\n192.168.56.102    Node2\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/hostnale -- Updated the correct host name.\n\n\nAfter these changes, I rebooted both VMs, internet is not working on both and not able to do SSH also. Please advise on this issue. I want to setup two Ubuntu VMs with static ip address and internet connectivity and need to do SSH between them.\n\nA: First of all you need to understand the type of interfaces and their usage:\n1) Host Only: Host only allows you to communicate with host computer only. So you can't use internet or communicate with other VMs.\n2) NAT: NAT allows you to communicate with other VMs as well as you can use internet. But you can't access e.g. server running on this VM from other PC on the network.\n3) Bridge: Apart from functionality provided by NAT, using Bridge you can access e.g. server running on this VM from other PC on the network.\nHope this helps. Try to test using different interfaces & it'll become more clear. \n\nA: This is incomplete hint scenario that may need some experimentation to make it working but in theory it shall work.\nIn Virtual Box you shall have a NAT-LAN network adapter. Put on both virtual machines this network driver. Then devise a IP plan for new \"internal\" network of 'cluster' servers.\nSay your PC has an IP from the range 192.168.56.x\nyour virtual boxes could have 10.0.0.x addresses (see private IPv4 ranges)\nIn this setup your virtual boxes are separated from your internal network (as they become a subnet to your LAN).\nYou shall be able to get out to the internet (downloading, accessing sites via the NAT system), you shall also be able to see one VM from another VM (ftp/ssh/ports) but you will be unable to access these machines from your internal network (other pc's that are in your lan, even you shall be unable to access via the net these machines by using SSH from your hosting pc OS). Reason being - they are on two different networks.\nThis issue should be overcomed by setting a software router that would sit on 192.168.56.x and 10.0.0.x networks (can't give you exact recipe here) but I believe a third virtual machine with two virtual network cards (configured for these two networks) and IPfw or similar software router in function shall resolve the problem. Note that setting of software router is demanding work on its own.\nIt could also be possible that one of your virtual machines runs also a software router with more than one virtual network card (some being on nat, some being sitting in each network). \nCaveat: You may need plenty of RAM and faster PC for this system to run smoothly (as you could be running 4 hosts parallely.

However, I have one problem with viewing the output file.\nThe tutorial says to use the \\lv command. However, when I try that, it tries to open foo.dvi with evince, which happens to fail spectacularly:\n\nThis is strange, though, since the docs say that xdvi should be the default DVI viewer in the first place. Anyway, I tried setting it as the default:\n:let g:Tex_ViewRule_dvi = 'xdvi'\n\nThis had absolutely no effect.

I have two fullHD monitors, one of which is a 15\" Laptop screen. How can I change the DPI of only that particular screen, to read text more comfortably?\n\nA: Ubuntu does not handle this very well yet - you can not have two monitors with drastically varying DPI and drag windows between them and have it work as it should. It is a limitation of Xorg and the widget toolkits. The problem is that they use a single DPI value, and then a window is sized in pixels, so if you have a 400 pixel wide window on your external monitor and drag it onto a hiDPI display, it will still be 400 pixels wide, but due to the increased pixel density will look far too small.\nIn Unity you can change the scaling of the Unity interface with \"Scale for menu and title bars\" in Display Settings, but this scaling does not affect applications.\nWhat you might be able to do to mitigate this issue for applications is to lower the resolution of your hiDPI display using xrandr or Display Settings. The downside of this approach is that LCD displays look best at their native resolution, and using an alternative resolution can appear blurry. If this is a problem, you might be able to choose a resolution that is an integer scale of your original resolution (e.g. QHD => HD, 1920x1080 => 960x540 for FHD, 2560x1600 => 1280x800, 2880x1800 => 1440x900 etc.), but in practice you might not be able to do this because there is no exact integer scale resolution available.\nRelevant bug reports: \n\n\n*\n\n*Freedesktop bug #23705 - xserver forces 96 DPI on randr-1.2-capable drivers\n\n*Gnome bug #546711 - units and resolution independence\n", "Q: Could not launch managed proxy executable I have problem with tor and obfsproxy for using bridges on ubuntu 14.04.

If you thought you were installing alongside, as your comments suggest, then I'm afraid you erred. If you have critical personal files on the disk, then stop using it immediately and begin recovery operations using PhotoRec or a similar Windows-specific utility. Every second you continue to use the disk, you run the risk of Linux writing over an important Windows file. (This is true even if you don't actively do things; Linux writes log files and whatnot in the background.)\nYou have no \"missing 70GB.\" You're probably confusing gigabytes (GB) and gibibytes (GiB). gdisk uses the latter units, but disk manufacturers almost always use the former.\nFinally, your disk uses the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme. The gdisk tool you used to show your partitions is written for the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT). Although gdisk will show your partitions because it automatically converts from MBR to GPT, better (and safer) choices are fdisk, parted, and GParted. Please ignore bain's suggestion to use FixParts on the disk, unless you see other signs of trouble. The \"invalid GPT\" referred to by gdisk, in this context, means no GPT.

So, I could assign a ip address using Debian installer.\nBut, In fast installer, there are few references about the way to modify fast installer preseed files.\nI found the Adam Stoke's blog, it is very helpful but It didn't make me clear.\nUsing preseed files, I'd like to assign the ip address and download a script files through the specific URLs (late-command, wget) automatically.\nSo, If there are some materials explaining how to make curtin preseed files, please let me know.\n\nA: The fast installer does not use preseed at all.  It deploys a pre-installed image.  That is why it is faster.  I do not believe there is any way to do the customization you are looking for with the fast installer.\nAs for how to modify preseed files when using the default installer, you should be able to find what you need here: https://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/development/preseeds.html\nMark\n", "Q: Can't install packages in Lubuntu I installed Lubuntu yesterday and updated it.\nWhenever I run sudo apt-get update and afterwards sudo apt-get install spotify (for example), I get E: Impossible to get package \"spotify-client\" (roughly translated from my native language). \nI have used ubuntu before amongst other distros but this is the first time it happened to me.

Many people claim that it is impossible to install Ubuntu onto RAID 1 with the Desktop CD. Is this really true? If not, how can it be done?\n\nA: Edit: This guide does not take UEFI boot into account. Additional or different steps may be required if UEFI boot is desired. This guide assumes legacy boot!\nIt is true, that the ubiquity installer does not know about mdadm software raid devices. Also it is true, that the live-cd is missing the mdadm raid administration tool. However, doing some work by hand, it is very much possible to install Ubuntu on RAID1.\nIn the following I will assume two identical hard disks (/dev/sd[ab]) which will be used completely for our new install. To simplify the recovery if one drive fails, there will be only one mdadm-volume /dev/md0 which will then be partitioned for /, swap and data storage, e.g. /home.\nAfter booting up the live-cd and (if necessary) configuring network access, open up a terminal and assume root access sudo -s\napt-get install mdadm\n\nNow we create a single primary partition each of /dev/sda and /dev/sdb from sector 2048 to the end of the disk, for example using sudo fdisk. I also like to already set the partition type to fd for linux raid autodetection. The keystroke-sequence in fdisk (if the disk is emptyin the beginning, meaning no partitions) is n <return> p <return> 1 <return> 2048 <return> <return> t <return> fd <return> w <return>.\nNow we create the mdadm volume:\nmdadm --create /dev/md0 --bitmap=internal --level=1 -n 2 /dev/sd[ab]1\n\nI noticed, that the ubiquity installer also does not quite manage to create partitions inside this /dev/md0, so I also did this by hand - again using fdisk. So on /dev/md0 create the following partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/md0p1 for your root filesystem, the size of course depending upon how much software you are going to install.\n\n*/dev/md0p2 for swap, the size of course also depending on what you use the machine for and how much ram it's got\n\n*/dev/md0p3 for /home, all the space that's left\n\n\nAfter that we can begin the Installation. Make sure to start the installer from the terminal with the -b option, because installing the bootloader will fail anyway:\nubiquity -b\n\nMake sure to go for manual partitioning and \"use\" the 3 partitions you just created and tick the format checkbox for / and /home so a filesystem will be created.\nAfter the installation the system is not yet bootable, so do not restart the box right away. We need to chroot into the installed system and fixup some stuff:\nsudo -s\nmount /dev/md0p1 /mnt\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount -o bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nmount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc\ncat /etc/resolv.conf >> /mnt/etc/resolv.conf\nchroot /mnt\napt-get install mdadm\nnano /etc/grub.d/10_linux  # change quick_boot to 0\ngrub-install /dev/sda\ngrub-install /dev/sdb\nupdate-grub\nexit\n\nNow the newly installed system is ready to boot.

That should still be an option if you like, but it's a slog.\nYou could manually update (or find a PPA for) lvm2.

This is covered in the Wine wiki, but basically if you install the WinXP programs normally in Wine, then run this:\nWINEPREFIX=\"$HOME/.wine98\" winecfg\n\nand set up a second setup of Wine version for Windows 98, and then install it in that version:\nWINEPREFIX=\"$HOME/.wine98\" wine /path/to/program-that-needs-win98.exe\n\nBoth sets of applications should run happily, and if the Win98 one in ~/.wine98 mucks up, the WinXP in ~/.wine should be fine.\n", "Q: There's no battery indicator in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

Please help.\nHere is image links to be clear \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lf5bxkyr5g0g1eb/IMG_20140801_204930.jpg\nAnd here is the current status.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/28y6itwu37265p7/IMG_20140801_204802.jpg\n\nA: For a proper diagnosis, more information is needed: Boot an emergency Linux disc (like the installer in its \"try before installing\" mode) and run the Boot Info Script. This will produce a file called RESULTS.txt with lots of output. Post it to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here.\nWithout a proper diagnosis, there are two shot-in-the-dark approaches that might get you up and running again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a medium from the image. Disable Secure Boot (if it's active) and boot the medium. It should give you options to boot both Windows and Ubuntu. If both options work, boot to Ubuntu and install the Debian-package version of rEFInd. It should then take over your boot manager duties.\n\n*Boot to Linux (using either an emergency disk in EFI mode or rEFInd to boot the Linux on your hard disk) and run the Boot Repair tool. This program will re-install GRUB on your hard disk, which should begin working again.\n\n\nNote that the Boot Repair approach involves more of a leap of faith than the rEFInd approach. With rEFInd, the USB drive or CD-R boot serves as a proof of concept; if you can boot from the USB drive, you can be certain that rEFInd will work if the install to the hard disk is successful. With Boot Repair, though, there's no way to test its installation before it's done. In your case, it is at least unlikely to do any further damage.\nIf both methods fail, post the URL that Boot Repair produces. This is essentially the same output that Boot Info Script produces.\n\nA: It was asked and answered so it's recommended to be aware of Dual Boot approaches and follow these threads generally:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported)\n\n*How can I install Windows after I've installed Ubuntu?\n\n*Installing Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 8.1 \n\n*How can I install Ubuntu without removing Windows?\n\n*Why don't I have the option ''Install Ubuntu alongside with them''\n\n*Ubuntu install and dual Boot with Windows 8 UEFI\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10 installer/live fails to boot from DVD/USB on UEFI\n\n*Install Ubuntu next to Windows 8 (UEFI dual boot)\n\n*Windows 8 removes Grub as default boot manager\n\n*Windows 8 deletes GRUB when booting\n", "Q: IS it possible to upgrade from 12.10 to 14.04 LTS version is it possible to upgrade from ubuntu 12.10 version to 14.04 LTS version,\nPlease tell me the steps \nThanks in Advance!!!!\n\nA: No, unless yo upgrade to 13.04, then to 13.10 and finally to 14.04. But it's likely going to cause some trouble. A reinstall is probably way faster.\nYou can only upgrade from one version to the next one or from LTS to LTS.\n\nA: You may want to look here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes.\nAll steps necessary to upgrade from 12.10 to 14.04 LTS are provided.

I want to ssh or bash into a running docker container. Please, see example:\n$ sudo docker run -d webserver\nwebserver is clean image from ubuntu:14.04\n$ sudo docker ps\nCONTAINER ID  IMAGE            COMMAND    CREATED STATUS  PORTS          NAMES\n665b4a1e17b6  webserver:latest /bin/bash  ...     ...     22/tcp, 80/tcp loving_heisenberg \n\nNow I want to get something like this (go into the running container):\n$ sudo docker run -t -i webserver (or maybe 665b4a1e17b6 instead)\n$ root@665b4a1e17b6:/#\nHowever when I run the line above I get new CONTAINER ID:\n$ root@42f1e37bd0e5:/#\n\nI used Vagrant and I'd like to get a  similar behaviour as vagrant ssh.\n\nA: I've created a containerized SSH server that provides SSH capabilities to any running container. You don't need to change your container. The only requirement is that the container has bash.\nIf you have a container with name 'web-server1'. The following docker run command would start a second container that would provide SSH for the first container.\ndocker run -ti --name sshd-web-server1 -e CONTAINER=web-server1 -p 2222:22 \\\n-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(which docker):/usr/bin/docker \\\njeroenpeeters/docker-ssh\n\nFor more pointers, checkout https://github.com/jeroenpeeters/docker-ssh\n\nA: From Docker 1.3 onwards:\ndocker exec -it <containerIdOrName> bash\n\nBasically, if the Docker container was started using the /bin/bash command you can access it using attach. If not, then you need to execute the command to create a Bash instance inside the container using exec.\nAlso to exit Bash without leaving Bash running in a rogue process:\nexit\n\nYep, it is that simple.\n\nA: @jpetazzo has an awesome post about this subject. The short answer would be to use nsenter:\nPID=$(docker inspect --format {{.State.Pid}} <container_name_or_ID>)\nnsenter --target $PID --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid\n\nP.S.: Don't forget to check the discussion in the comments of the post...\nCheers\n\nA: You can also give the Docker container a routeable IP address with Pipework, and after that SSH into the machine with that new IP address.\nThis will be more \"traditional\" (ssh), instead of using an application-specific command like docker attach, and will eventually make it more 'portable' across systems and versions.\n\nA: Sometimes it will be handy to be able to ssh into a Docker container, especially during development. The following Docker image allows to ssh into a container using a private key:\nUbuntuWithSSH-Docker\nThe gist of the Dockerfile is https://gist.github.com/devbkhadka/98792f7bca57f9778793b2db758b3d07.\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo docker run -i -t webserver /bin/bash\n\nSource: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/\n\nA: Based on @Timur's answer I've created the following handy script\nSetup\nPut docker-ssh file in your $PATH with the following contents\n#!/bin/bash -xe\n\n# docker container id or name might be given as a parameter\nCONTAINER=$1\n\nif [[ \"$CONTAINER\" == \"\" ]]; then\n  # if no id given simply just connect to the first running container\n  CONTAINER=$(docker ps | grep -Eo \"^[0-9a-z]{8,}\\b\")\nfi\n\n# start an interactive bash inside the container\n# note some containers don't have bash, then try: ash (alpine), or simply sh\n# the -l at the end stands for login shell that reads profile files (read man)\ndocker exec -i -t $CONTAINER bash -l\n\nNote: Some container do not contain bash, but ash, sh etc. In these cases bash shall be replaced in the above script.\nUsage\nIf you have only one running instance, simply run\n$> docker-ssh \n\nOtherwise, provide it with a docker id parameter that you get from docker ps (first col)\n$> docker-ssh 50m3r4nd0m1d\n\n\nA: docker run -it openjdk:8\n\nThis works :-)\n\nA: GOINSIDE\ninstall goinside command line tool with:\nsudo npm install -g goinside\n\nand go inside a docker container with a proper terminal size with:\ngoinside docker_container_name\n\n\nfor more details check this out.\n\nA: If your container doesn't have bash installed you could try sh:\ndocker exec -it CONTAINER /bin/sh\n\nOr look for shells in /bin first:\ndocker export CONTAINER|tar -t|egrep ^bin/\n\n\nA: The answer is Docker's attach command. So for my example above, the solution will be:\n$ sudo docker attach 665b4a1e17b6 #by ID\nor\n$ sudo docker attach loving_heisenberg #by Name\n$ root@665b4a1e17b6:/#\n\nFor Docker version 1.3 or later: Thanks to user WiR3D who suggested another way to get a container's shell. If we use attach we can use only one instance of the shell. So if we want open a new terminal with a new instance of a container's shell, we just need to run the following:\n$ sudo docker exec -i -t 665b4a1e17b6 /bin/bash #by ID\n\nor\n$ sudo docker exec -i -t loving_heisenberg /bin/bash #by Name\n$ root@665b4a1e17b6:/#\n\n\nA: Although the author of the question specifically said they are interested in a running container, it's also worth noting that if the container is not running, but you'd like to run it to poke around you can run:\ndocker run -i -t --entrypoint /bin/bash <imageID>\n\nA: To bash into a running container, type this:\ndocker exec -t -i container_name /bin/bash\n\n\nA: Just for information. If you need to login in a simple container that is not a daemon, you need to use the following commands:\ndocker start {id}\ndocker attach {id}\n\n\nA: if the container is stopped like for example a data-only container then a good solution is to run a throwaway container every time you want to attach to the data container. In this case the data container itself could be entirely empty, as the temporary container would have the OS tools.\n$ docker run --rm --volumes-from mydata -it ubuntu bash\nroot@645045d3cc87:/# ls /mydata\nroot@645045d3cc87:/# touch /mydata/foo\nroot@645045d3cc87:/# exit\nexit\n\n", "Q: Get ubuntu on another computer without internet I want to get Ubuntu on my other computer that can't get internet, and since it can't get internet, can I download it on my current (this one) and load it on a USB to install it on the other computer? \n\nA: Yes.

They can be listed easily if you wanted, e.g. ls -lA.\nAs for hiding partitions, you can use gparted to set a \"hidden\" flag on partitions. This will hide the partition from operating systems. Note that this can be easily reverted, so don't use this for hiding sensitive data.\nIf you want to operate on the same disk you're booting from, you might need a live CD/DVD or (preferably) a live USB stick.\nIf you are looking for security, search this site (or Google) for encrypted folders and partitions.\n", "Q: How may I install the right Java Virtual Machine?

Aren't there other ways which makes it invisible even after pressing CTRL + H. Total Hiding \n\nA: Not sure what your end goal is.\nIf its security your after you need to look in to Unix file permissions or maybe even file encryption.\nHiding a file provides no measure of security.\n\nA: Well you could make the containing directory owned by somebody else (eg root) and disable others' read permissions on it:\n$ sudo mkdir --mode 700 lockbox\n$ ls lockbox/\nls: cannot open directory lockbox/: Permission denied\n\nBut you'll have to be root to enter it. With that in mind, you would do as well to just use /root. Anybody with sudo access can view the directory but it's probably better than nothing.\n\nA: Well, what you are trying to do sounds a lot like steganography, which is a rather advanced version of the technique of labelling a tape of secret files with something inconspicuous such as \"Gov promo 1989\".\nIn other words, the trick is to masquerade the information as noise in a different file, which won't easily get noticed unless you know it's hidden in there.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography\nThere are various tools for that, and you might want to have a look at this: https://superuser.com/questions/95877/steganography-software\nThen there is this trick, mainly interesting because it relies on the often forgotten fact that headers are not to be assumed to always tell the truth: http://www.unixmen.com/steganography-in-ubuntu-hide-your-files-inside-an-image/\nThat said, I'm not sure if it's a great idea if your objective is a degree of actual security.\nI would discourage even considering it unless you know very very well what you are doing.\nStoring the information on a removable drive and physically locking it into a safe might be a step up − or a giant step down if, for example, your host machines somehow caches and indexes files on removable drivers.\nAll in all the best advice I feel like giving you, if you are aiming for security (as opposed to fun/experimentation) is: forget it.\n\nA: No, there is no such thing as Completely Hidden files.

My desktop environment intentionally does not have all the Gnome / Freedesktop daemons running — I don't want them.\nWhen I execute gedit from a terminal like this:\ngedit file\n\nIt outputs messages like this all over my terminal whenever I hit enter or save or on various other occasions:\n(gedit:5700): Gtk-WARNING **: Calling Inhibit failed: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files\n\nI understand the meaning of this warning and I have decided that it doesn't matter to me.\nHow can I turn off this kind of warning? By \"turn off\", I don't mean any of these or similar workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*piping the output of gedit into /dev/null\n\n*writing a wrapper script that pipes the output of gedit into /dev/null\n\n*creating an alias that pipes the output of gedit into /dev/null\nThese workarounds are not acceptable as they have to be applied individually to each Gnome application — gedit is not the only one that likes to mess up the terminal.\n\nA: Its also a workaround, but you don't have to apply this for every application.\nWrite this to your .bashrc and you can use this wrapper with F12 (or chose another key) to suppress the warnings:\n# output filter\nof() { \n    if [ -n \"$*\" ]; then   \n        # write the real command to history without the prefix \"of\" \n        history -s \"$*\"\n\n        # catch the command output\n        errorMsg=$( $* 2>&1 )\n\n        # check if the command output contains not a GTK-Warning\n        if ! $(echo $errorMsg | grep -q 'Gtk-WARNING'); then\n            echo $errorMsg \n        fi\n    fi\n}\n\n# write the function \"of\" before every command if the user presses F12\nbind '\"\\e[24~\": \"\\e[1~ of \\e[4~\\n\"'\n\n\nA: I actually wrote the hide-warnings tool in C which I find much easier to use than the script shown above. Also, it will write all the output written to stdout by default (because the Gtk and other warnings are sent to stderr so it parses stderr not stdout by default).\nOne big problem with the script above is that it won't write anything to your console, even if it does not match the regex, until done. This is because it saves all the data in a variable and then grep that variable once done. It also means that it will save the output in that variable possibly using a lot of memory (at least you should save that in a temporary file.) Finally, from what I can see, the grep will prevent any display if any one line matches. Maybe not exactly what you want.\nThe tool can be used in a simple alias like this:\nalias gvim=\"hide-warnings gvim\"\n\n(I use gvim... I'm sure it would work with gedit too.)\nThe file is self contained, no dependencies other than the C library, so you can get a copy and easily compile and install it:\ngcc hide-warnings.c -o hide-warnings\nsudo cp hide-warnings /usr/bin/.\n\nThere is some further documentation in the file and you can use --help once compiled for quick docs.\nThe newer version, which at some point will make use of the advgetopt library, is in C++.\n\nA: First, I also find it annoying that these warnings show up on an out-of-the-box Ubuntu, with no \"proper\" method to disable them which I could find (it seems that the most common \"solution\" is either to install gir1.2-gtksource-3.0 which doesn't seem to work since it's already installed, or to ignore them - but I want to suppress them completely since they just make my terminal noisy).\nI came up with the following code which so far seems to behave exactly how I'd expect it to, and is based on the answer by TuKsn, but enhances it a bit to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Work by default (gedit ...) without needing to use F12 or some other shortcut (to invoke unfiltered use /usr/bin/gedit ...).\n\n*Displays the entered command name when it terminates as a background task.\n\n\nCan still be generalized a bit, but for now, if you need the same treatment for other commands, duplicate the gedit() function for each other command name which needs the same filter.\n# solution adapted from: http://askubuntu.com/questions/505594\n# TODO: use a list of warnings instead of cramming all of them to a single grep.\n# TODO: generalize gedit() to allow the same treatment for several commands\n#       without duplicating the function with only a different name\n# output filter. takes: name_for_history some_command [arguments]\n# the first argument is required both for history, but also when invoking to bg\n# such that it shows Done <name> ... instead of e.g. Done /usr/bin/gedit ...\nsuppress-gnome-warnings() {\n    # $1 is the name which should appear on history but is otherwise unused.\n    historyName=$1\n    shift\n\n    if [ -n \"$*\" ]; then\n        # write the real command to history without the prefix\n        # syntax adapted from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4827690\n        history -s \"$historyName ${@:2}\"\n\n        # catch the command output\n        errorMsg=$( $* 2>&1 )\n\n        # check if the command output contains not a (one of two) GTK-Warnings\n        if ! $(echo $errorMsg | grep -q 'Gtk-WARNING\\|connect to accessibility bus'); then\n            echo $errorMsg\n        fi\n    fi\n}\ngedit() {\n  suppress-gnome-warnings $FUNCNAME $(which $FUNCNAME) $@\n}\n\nAnd a better version (way smaller, fully generic, no need to rewrite history since invoked as is, and better for filtering per line rather than the whole output):\n# generates a function named $1 which:\n# - executes $(which $1) [with args]\n# - suppresses output lines which match $2\n# e.g. adding: _supress echo \"hello\\|world\"\n# will generate this function:\n# echo() { $(which echo) \"$@\" 2>&1 | tr -d '\\r' | grep -v \"hello\\|world\"; }\n# and from now on, using echo will work normally except that lines with\n# hello or world will not show at the output\n# to see the generated functions, replace eval with echo below\n# the 'tr' filter makes sure no spurious empty lines pass from some commands\n_supress() {\n  eval \"$1() { \\$(which $1) \\\"\\$@\\\" 2>&1 | tr -d '\\r' | grep -v \\\"$2\\\"; }\"\n}\n\n_supress gedit          \"Gtk-WARNING\\|connect to accessibility bus\"\n_supress gnome-terminal \"accessibility bus\\|stop working with a future version\"\n_supress firefox        \"g_slice_set_config\"\n\n\nA: I was looking to find a utility to solve this sort of problem, myself.\nMy issues with the provided answers are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's important that stdout and stderr don't get aggregated into one stream\n\n*I cannot invoke a command, filter all the output until it terminates, and print it at the end (i.e. the solution must stream the output properly)\n\n*I would like to preserve the order of stdout and stderr messages as much as possible\n\n\nI appreciate the attempts I've seen to do this with Bash, however, I failed to identify a solution that achieved all 3 of the conditions outlined above.\nMy ultimate solution is written in NodeJS, which I understand will not be installed on many linux boxes.  Before choosing to write the JS version, I attempted to code it in python, and found the async IO library is pretty ugly and broken until VERY recent versions of python (~3.5 which is available out-of-box on SOME newer distros).\nMinimizing dependencies was the ONLY reason to choose python, so I abandoned it for NodeJS, which has a remarkable set of libraries for somewhat low-level, async-oriented IO.\nHere it is:\n#!/usr/bin/env nodejs\n\nconst spawn = require('child_process').spawn\n\nfunction usage() {\n    console.warn('Usage: filter-err <error regex> <cmd> [<cmd arg> ...]')\n    process.exit(1)\n}\n\nfunction main(err_regex, cmd_arr) {\n    let filter = new RegExp(err_regex)\n\n    let proc = spawn(cmd_arr[0], cmd_arr.slice(1), {\n        shell: true,\n        stdio: ['inherit', 'inherit', 'pipe']\n    })\n\n    proc.stderr.on('data', (err) => {\n        err = err.toString('utf8')\n\n        if (! err.match(filter))\n            process.stderr.write(err)\n    })\n\n    proc.on('close', (code) => process.exit(code))\n}\n\nconst argv = process.argv\n\nif (argv.length < 4)\n    usage()\nelse\n    main(argv[2], argv.slice(3))\n\nTo use this script, you might add these lines to your .bashrc:\nalias gimp='filter-err \"GLib-[^ ]*-WARNING\" gimp'\n\nThe subprocess you choose to run will inherit stdin, so you are free to use BASH pipes or redirection.\n\nA: One solution is to create a function to suppress the Gtk error messages.\nSometimes, it's not obvious where the error is coming from.\nFor example, if you have the following in your .gitconfig, which tells git to use meld to as it's git difftool:\n[diff]\n    tool = meld\n[difftool]\n    prompt = false\n[difftool \"meld\"]\n    cmd = meld \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\n\nAnd then you attempt to diff a your .bashrc file:\n$ git difftool .bashrc\n\nYou might get a lot of annoying Gtk error messages:\n2021-04-12 18:01:59,905 CRITICAL Gtk: gtk_widget_get_scale_factor: assertion 'GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed\n2021-04-12 18:01:59,905 CRITICAL Gtk: gtk_widget_get_scale_factor: assertion 'GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed\n2021-04-12 18:01:59,905 CRITICAL Gtk: gtk_widget_get_scale_factor: assertion 'GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed\n2021-04-12 18:01:59,905 CRITICAL Gtk: gtk_widget_get_scale_factor: assertion 'GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed\n2021-04-12 18:01:59,905 CRITICAL Gtk: gtk_widget_get_scale_factor: assertion 'GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed\n. . .\n\nCreate a function that will redirect your output and stderr to /dev/null\n$ function git-difftool(){ git difftool ${@} & &>/dev/null; }\n\nNow, when you run git-difftool .bashrc, you'll see no more Gtk error messages.\nA side benefit is that by adding the ampersand control operator in the definition of the git-difftool function, you can run this command in the background, which will free up your terminal, s.t., you can run other commands along with your meld difftool window.\n", "Q: I have Xubuntu 14.04. Can't delete a \"phantom\" file from my home folder I tried to create a file in my home folder by right-clicking in the folder and selecting \"Create Document\", then \"Empty File\".\nWhen the window came up to name the new file, which already had \"New Empty File\" in the window, I replaced that with a different name, .gtkrc-2.0, and clicked on \"Create.\"\nThen nothing happened; no new file appeared in the home folder.  I figured I had done it wrong, so I tried it differently; that is, by just letting the name \"New Empty File\" be and then click on \"Create.\"  A new file with that name does appear in the folder, but when I try to rename it .gtkrc-2.0, I get the message that the file can't be renamed because .gtkrc-2.0 already exists.\nSo somehow the system has been fooled into thinking that the file already exists even though it doesn't it appear in the folder, nor can it be located with \"find file.\"  It's a phantom file. \nCan anyone help me get rid if it?\n\nA: Yeah, if it starts with . it is a hidden file.

I used xbacklight to change the brightness.  I used pactl to change the volume and toggle the mute.  I was going to try to bind this to the keys but I couldn't located the keys using xmodmap, so I simply used the XFCE keyboard shortcuts tool which was easier anyway.\nWhiskey Menu -> Settings -> Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts\n\nYou click Add, then enter the command you want to execute, click OK, and press the key that will execute the command. \nTo increase the brightness:\nxbacklight -inc 10\n\nTo decrease the brightness:\nxbacklight -dec 10\n\nTo decrease the volume:\npactl set-sink-volume alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo -- -10%\n\nTo increase the volume:\npactl set-sink-volume alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo -- +10%\n\nTo toggle mute:\npactl set-sink-mute alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo toggle\n\nIt is possible that your audio device is not the same as mine, alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.

I've enabled host-only networking in the VM's settings. When I do ifconfig | grep addr I get an inet addr: 192.168.56.101. I went through the steps in this post: How can I access Apache (on VirtualBox guest) from host? but it's simply not working. When I ping the server, all I get are packet timeouts. I'm trying to make my host and guest talk to each other so that I can test some networking code. Any ideas?\n\nA: 192.168.56.101 is an address given by virtualbox's internal DHCP server if you select host-only networking, but it doesn't mean that it will magically be able to communicate with your host system, this needs some extra configuration to ensure that routes are properly set up. The easiest way to get host and guest to talk to each other is to select bridged networking, in this case the guest (VM) will appear to be connected to the same network as the host. This depends on having a DHCP server on your home or work network to assign an address to the VM which will appear like just another computer on the network. Either that, or configure an IP address for it manually.\n", "Q: Lost permission to download into anything but /home Not sure what caused it but one day I couldn't download any files into my download directory where the error was \"Insufficient permissions\".

So, /tmp/ was fine, and you really should not create /msp/ either as it violates the Filesystem Hierarchy guidelines.\nMy guess is that psmouse is considered a crucial module which should be available when Ubuntu boots, and therefore ends up in the initial ramdisk. As your new module replaced an existing module (psmouse), you can try to run the sudo update-initramfs -u to get your new module in the initrd. You only need to do this once as further kernel updates will trigger this automatically.\n", "Q: new skype will not install in lucid due to dependency on libqt4-network 4:4.8.0 today I was not able to log into skype in lucid as the newest version of skype is now required.

I just booted into my school's computer using a Ubuntu install disk.  It might not seem that hard but it's a technical school and they have them pretty locked down, maybe not for you but for me it is locked down.  I am graduating in a few weeks so I am going to take advantage of this as much as I can. \nI thought if anyone asks I will just tell them its  a VM for some class and that got me thinking. Is a live CD technically a VM? I mean it is not technically installed on this computer. So it's virtual, right?\nSecond question... what should I do?\n\nA: A live CD system is installed... on the live CD itself.\nMost of the time, we boot our computers from an internal hard drive. The computer's BIOS (or EFI/UEFI, which may informally be called a \"BIOS\") accesses the drive, loads the operating system's boot loader, and executes it.\nIt works the same way for booting from drives other than an internal hard drive. Which drives your computer can boot from (without leveraging another layer of software) depends on your computer's BIOS. Essentially all PCs manufactured anytime in the last couple decades can boot from:\n\n*\n\n*an internal hard drive\n\n*an optical drive, if the computer has one built in\n\n*an external, USB-attached hard disk or similar device (like a pendrive / flash drive)\n\nMany computers can boot over a network (PXE booting), which is as nifty as it sounds but is complicated enough to set up that it's usually not worth it for booting from a single computer. Some computers can also boot from other devices, such as Firewire (IEEE 1394) drives.\nBooting from an internal hard drive runs the system installed on it. In your case, that's whatever operating system was installed by your school's IT people.\nBooting from a removable disk, like a CD/DVD or USB flash drive, runs the system installed on the removable disk. When you write an Ubuntu desktop ISO image to a USB flash drive, or burn it to CD or DVD (or other optical medium, such as a Blu-Ray), this causes an Ubuntu live environment to be installed on the CD/DVD/USB.\nBut there are different kinds of installation.\nThere are differences between an Ubuntu system installed in the usual way on your computer (i.e., what you would get if you selected Install Ubuntu... which you should probably not do on your school's computers), and a live environment.\nA live system is designed to run on a very wide range of different hardware. Therefore, installing it (i.e., making the live medium from an ISO image file) does not require specialized steps to identify hardware, enable drivers for it, and perform other customizations. This is why it can simply be \"stamped out\" from a disk image.\nIn contrast, while there is such a thing as a disk image for a hard drive (and they're used by backup solutions like CloneZilla and Ghost), writing a generic disk image to a hard disk would not be an effective way to create a normal operating system installation. This is because:\n\n*\n\n*Where on the disk partitions must be created, and of what size, varies. Some installations, especially (but not only) on servers, have partitions on multiple disks or use RAID or LVM.\n\n*What initial software is installed and how it is configured varies somewhat, mainly with respect to device drivers.\n\n*An initial user account must be created and some files--at least the user's home folder--are named with their username. The user account's home folder is often located on the same partition as the rest of the system.\n\nA virtual machine is different.\nUnlike booting your computer from a traditionally installed system on an internal drive, or a live system on a CD/DVD or USB flash drive, a virtual machine does not involve booting your computer at all. That's why it's virtual: it is a computer simulation of a (different) computer.\nAs Ruslan Gerasimov says, a virtual machine can run a traditionally installed system or a live system. Whether or not a machine is virtual and whether or not it's running a live environment are independent.\nThere is one important similarity, practically speaking, between a live system and a virtual machine (live or not):\n\n*\n\n*You can take a live CD/DVD or live USB from one computer to another, and it should work, because it is not specialized to any particular hardware configuration or user customization.\n\n*You can do the same thing with a virtual machine--because even if the OS installation is machine-customized, it's customized to the guest (virtual) machine, which can be emulated/virtualized on multiple host (physical) machines.\n\n\nA: No, it's not a virtual machine(VM). You just have another source of booting an operating system(OS). So in your case you boot your machine from a Live CD and that is a real machine, not a virtual, because it works straight on your CPU without being hosted by any other OS.\nBy the way, the fact you didn't install it means nothing here in terms of visualization. Moreover it is often needed to install an OS to a VM. However I think it is also possible to run a Live CD under a virtual machine, I guess, so in this case that would be a virtual machine!\n", "Q: HDD 46G used per GParted and df - but only 10G per ncdu, du, baobab etc Ubuntu 12.04LTS Good day.

Here are some additions I might make to his solution.\nOnly querying lock state\nIf you simply need a one-liner to query the lock state, this should evaluate to true if locked and false if unlocked.\nisLocked=$(gdbus call -e -d com.canonical.Unity -o /com/canonical/Unity/Session -m com.canonical.Unity.Session.IsLocked | grep -ioP \"(true)|(false)\")\n\n\nQuerying lock state and track time since last change in state\nNow if you need to keep track of how long the screen has been locked you might want to take a different approach.\n#!/bin/bash\n# To implement this, you can put this at the top of a bash script or you can run\n# it the subshell in a separate process and pull the functions into other scripts.\n\n# We need a file to keep track of variable inside subshell the file will contain\n# two elements, the state and timestamp of time changed, separated by a tab.\n# A timestamp of 0 indicates that the state has not changed since we started\n# polling for changes and therefore, the time lapsed in the current state is\n# unknown.\nvars=\"/tmp/lock-state\"\n\n# start watching the screen lock state\n(\n    # set the initial value for lock state\n    [ \"$(gdbus call -e -d com.canonical.Unity -o /com/canonical/Unity/Session -m com.canonical.Unity.Session.IsLocked | grep -ioP \"(true)|(false)\")\" == \"true\" ] && state=\"locked\" || state=\"unlocked\"\n    printf \"%s\\t%d\" $state 0 > \"$vars\"\n    \n    # start watching changes in state\n    gdbus monitor -e -d com.canonical.Unity -o /com/canonical/Unity/Session | while read line\n    do \n        state=$(grep -ioP \"((un)?locked)\" <<< \"$line\")\n        # If the line read denotes a change in state, save it to a file with timestamp for access outside this subshell\n        [ \"$state\" != \"\" ] && printf \"%s\\t%d\" ${state,,} $(date +%s)> \"$vars\"\n    done\n) & # don't wait for this subshell to finish\n\n# Get the current state from the vars exported in the subshell\nfunction getState {\n    echo $(cut -f1 \"$vars\")\n}\n\n# Get the time in seconds that has passed since the state last changed\nfunction getSecondsElapsed {\n    if [ $(cut -f2 \"$vars\") -ne 0 ]; then\n        echo $(($(date +%s)-$(cut -f2 \"$vars\")))\n    else\n        echo \"unknown\"\n    fi\n}\n\nEssentially, this script watches for changes in the lock state of the screen. When changes take place, the time and state is dumped to a file. You can read this file manually if you like or use the functions I wrote.\nIf you want a timestamp rather than the number of seconds, try:\ndate -ud @$(getSecondsElapsed) | grep -oP \"(\\d{2}:){2}\\d{2}\"\n\nDon't forget the -u switch which forces the date program to ignore your timezone.\n\nA: the screen is actually locked by Unity, and, we need to use gdbus\ngdbus monitor -e -d com.canonical.Unity -o /com/canonical/Unity/Session\n\nthis will show when it got locked like:\n/com/canonical/Unity/Session: com.canonical.Unity.Session.LockRequested ()\n/com/canonical/Unity/Session: com.canonical.Unity.Session.Locked ()\n/com/canonical/Unity/Session: com.canonical.Unity.Session.UnlockRequested ()\n/com/canonical/Unity/Session: com.canonical.Unity.Session.Unlocked ()\n\n\nA: I had a similar question here\nand the help I got was similar to what Aquarius Power said before, except that it was included in a bash scrip daemon, that can run in the background..

To flow into the problems I had been dealing with, my copy of Lubuntu 13 became so unstable that I decided to do a fresh install of the alternative install of Lubuntu 14. Had quite a bit of trouble with that, but eventually, after some hours, got it through using a terminal command to make a bootable USB.\nHowever, a particular problem that affected my prior system seems to have followed me here, and in researching/contemplating it, I think it was the problem that made my prior system so unstable. \nEverytime I boot, I get this message that \"cryptswap1\" is not mounted, along with a prompt to manually fix it and whatnot. I don't think much of it, but in reading on it, I see it's connected to RAM-saps, and my constantly having to reboot prior was definitely due to constant computer freeze-ups. Thus, I suspect my not getting this cryptswap1 business in order is why my computer was so malfunctional.\nI did search these forums and WAS following along in this guide:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/342002/217795\nBut I got stuck on the Gparted portion. I managed to install and run GParted, but when I request that its turn /dev/sda5 into linux-swap, it cannot do so, and the source of the error is confusing. Otherwise the file system is listed as \"unknown\" for the partition. \nI tried double-checking my terminal commands -- a funny thing about writing here is that it prompts all sorts of thoughts for what to research or solutions to try -- and I may have goofed up there. \nIn step two, it says to \"save the file\", but how does one do that within the terminal? I cannot find any save command, and there's no respond to ctrl + s. \nAlso, I'm having a tough time comprehending the way the terminal commands function, as, in being such a newb, I can presently only think in concrete-bound matters, and just copy the steps concretely, unable to apply originally. Thus, when asked to input sudo nano -w /etc/crypttab , I can follow through, but when it tells me to open /etc/fstab I get confused when sudo -w /etc/fstab doesn't give me the same results.\nSo I either goofed in doing the proper modifcations in terminal, or else I've got to get myself unstuck in Gparted somehow.\nSo what should this foolish man do to get his RAM back?\n\nOops. I forgot to include the error-info from GParted. It doesn't seem to have any useful information, but in case anyone asks for it:\nGParted 0.18.0 --enable-libparted-dmraid --enable-online-resize\nLibparted 2.3\nFormat /dev/sda5 as linux-swap  00:00:01    ( ERROR )\ncalibrate /dev/sda5  00:00:00    ( SUCCESS )\npath: /dev/sda5\nstart: 501760\nend: 156301311\nsize: 155799552 (74.29 GiB)\nclear old file system signatures in /dev/sda5  00:00:00    ( SUCCESS )\nwrite 68.00 KiB of zeros at byte offset 0  00:00:00    ( SUCCESS )\nwrite 4.00 KiB of zeros at byte offset 67108864  00:00:00    ( SUCCESS )\nwrite 4.00 KiB of zeros at byte offset 79769366528  00:00:00    ( SUCCESS )\nflush operating system cache of /dev/sda  00:00:00    ( SUCCESS )\nset partition type on /dev/sda5  00:00:01    ( SUCCESS )\nnew partition type: linux-swap(v1)\ncreate new linux-swap file system  00:00:00    ( ERROR )\nmkswap -L \"\" /dev/sda5\n/dev/sda5: Device or resource busy\n\nUpdate: Problem Resolved\nI'm sorry that I forgot to give a definitive finish to this problem. Anyhow, I fresh installed the latest Lubuntu, and aside from getting rid of cryptswap1, I think Google Chrome was the major problem. My old laptop is really underpowered, and apparently they gave a major update to Chrome that made it \"crash-proof.\" Unfortunately, that crash-proof status made it a MAJOR resource hog, so I rely on Firefox now and everything runs well.\n\nA: First of all, you are using Lubuntu instead of Ubuntu, so you do not have nano installed in your machine. You should use leafpad. The best way to open a text file as root is to type: \ngksudo leafpad the_file_adress.\nSecond, Lubuntu 14.04 should not be using a swap partition. It must have got one, but its priority should be set as -1 and a zram \"device\" ought to be used instead, most of times. You can check if this is happening by writing this in a shell:\ncat /proc/swaps\nZram is a software which creates a tmpfs (temporary file system which is a file system in RAM) where it stored the data compressed to avoid using a swap partition.\nAbout the problem, I do not know if you need an encrypted swap partition since it ought not to be used. Can I ask you how much RAM your computer has? Did you chose to encrypt your home folder when you were installing Lubuntu? If you did it, the encrypted swap partition may be compulsory. I do not know the matter.\nPerhaps, the best choice is to follow that user's instructions. I think you can use the disk utility of Lubuntu instead of GParted, but be careful. And you ought to change the seventh step so as to set the priority of that swap partition as -1. You can run sudo swapon -p -1 /dev/..., where ... is the same as previously in their instructions, instead of sudo swapon /dev/.... /dev/... must be the swap device.\nHowever, I have not been able to found out if writing the minus sign in this way is allowed. Perhaps, some user with more knoledge of linux might confirm it. Otherwise, you can try typing it.\nIf you did not chose to encrypt anything when you were installing, you'd better not run sudo ecryptfs-setup-swap.\nI should tell you that more experienced users of Lubuntu usually follow its mailing list:\nhttps://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/lubuntu-users. Writing an email there is the best support option.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Nautilus Actions Only Show if File in Folder I would like to create a couple of nautilus actions that will only show up if a certain file is in the folder. These are location actions, a simple example of one I would like is a \"Make\" option that runs make in the folder, but only shows up if that folder contains a makefile. Is something like this possible?\nI have tried playing with basenames but they seem to only work for selected items. I have also looked into the \"Execution Environment\" option on the \"Environment\" panel. I could probably do this by using the \"Appears if the command outputs 'true'\" option, but I can't figure out how to pass the folder path to that command.\n\nA: I was able to solve this with a lot of playing around.\nFirst I found that the standard variables can in fact be passed to the 'Appears if the command outputs \"true\"' setting on the Environment tab by using zenity to view what this was doing. The one we are interested in here is %f. Also worth noting is that the command must output \"true\" with no newline to its stdout, rather than simply using a zero return code to mean true.\nI then tried inputing the following command: \nls '%f' | grep -q 'Makefile' && echo -n 'true'\n\nWhich should work fine but it seems that there must be a SINGLE command in that field, the piping and && won't work. \nI ended up creating the following script which I marked as executable and placed in my bin directory\n#!/bin/bash\n# testexists\n\nls $1 | grep -q $2 && echo -n 'true'\n\nThen I put the following into the 'Appears if command outputs \"true\"' field\ntestexists '%f' 'Makefile'\n\nAnd everything started working (e.g. my make command only shows up if the folder contains a Makefile). \n", "Q: Backlight issues with Asus X551MAV-EB01-B I've got a fresh install of trusty (xubuntu if that matters, I don't think it should) on a Asus X551MAV-EB01-B.

Graphic Card problem? I am on a Dell Latitude D430, Intel® Core™2 CPU U7600 @ 1.20GHz × 2, 2GB Ram, Graphics Intel® 945GM x86/MMX/SSE2 and running Ubuntu 14.02 32bit.\nWhenever I play movies that are 1080p, VLC starts stuttering like crazy, the whole system basically jams, CPU consumption goes through the roof and even firefox is so slow. I stopped getting 1080p movies altogether to avoid these frozen states.\nWith 720p movies the situation is a bit better. Mostly they work fine, but every once a while VLC starts stuttering and pixelating. If I press pause and wait for a minute, the CPU seems to \"cool down\" and I can resume playing without problems. \nSometimes even on youtube, which is automatically set at low res, 360p, the play stutters and this is certainly not the internet which is 500mbps and also streaming is fully pre-loaded. \nI at first thought that this could depend on the slow CPU. I have run terminal -top to check CPU consumption and it looks high, when I play movies it goes up to 120 or 130% consumption, but I think this is still ok, since it's a dual core, so maximum should be 200%, right?\nI worry the problem is maybe with the integrated intel graphic card. I have found many users complaining about this running ubuntu, with my same exact model. \nThe drivers are correctly installed and everything seems kosher, if it wasn't that performance is very bad. \nSo my question is: is this problem with Ubuntu? if I install iOS Luna or another distro or even (yuck) putting on a Win7 would I be able to play movies normally? I think the laptop specs should be enough for at least a 720p movie and I use mainly my laptop for movies as it is connected to my tv.\nif the problem lies with the specs insufficient to play HD movies, should I buy a graphic card or is it the CPU that it is too slow and I need to just resign myself to get a new laptop?\nthank you\n\nA: sudo apt-get install x264 i965-va-driver libva-intel-vaapi-driver vainfo\n\nthen activate GPU hardware acceleration in VLC Tools -> Preferences -> Input&Codecs -> Hardware-accelerated decoding = VAAPI\nhttps://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_GPU_Decoding/\nHow do I enable hardware accelerated video in VLC with Intel HD 4000 GPU?\n\nAlso, I've found this link helpfull with sandybridge but not so much on pentium-4 but it won't hurt to at least give it a shot http://www.webupd8.org/2013/09/adobe-flash-player-hardware.html\nFinally, there are all sorts of openGL packages available that are not installed by default, just dont install the ones for nvidia and or ati etc.\n\nA: \n[...] the chip is able to accelerate the decoding of MPEG2 videos and supports Motion Compensation (2 HD Streams simultaneously). Modern HD videos in MPEG 4 or VC-1 can not be decoded with the graphics card. \nSource: Notebookcheck\n\nNow, speaking from experience with a similar GPU (GMA 3150, which is supposed to be a little faster), you can play 720p HD video with VLC, but no 1080p and flash-html5 video decoding is awful (youtube, for example). \nThis occurs both on Windows 7, 8.1 and Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04. \nSorry for that, the 945GM really isn't made for 2014. But 720p videos, without streaming, using VLC, that should work. \nI personnaly noticed some small improvements using Windows over Ubuntu, regarding Video Decoding.\n\nYou won't be able to change an integrated chipset on a laptop, or if you're lucky enough to find a video-card that could fit somewhere in there, nothing tells you that the laptop will accept it, as the mainboard are usually pretty closed on additional stuffs.\n\nFinally, the issue here is the GPU chipset, not the CPU, which is good enough for most things.\n\nA: Go to the Power Plan (The battery or Charge icon in the task bar). Change it from Power saver to Balanced or High Performance.

If not, press CTRL + ALT + F2 and then sign in with your username and password.\nOnce you are signed in, type the following command:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nor\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nIf you are using gnome you may need to use gdm instead of lightdm like this:\nsudo service gdm start\n\nAlternatively, you can start the xsession without a display manager. You can use this command to start the xsession and default desktop:\nstartx\n\nPlease post any errors to receive further assistance.\nI really don't see how sudo su would cause the problem you are experiencing unless it has to do with one of the commands you entered after becoming root.\n", "Q: VM VirtualBox Resolution Proplem I am running Ubuntu on Oracle VM VirtualBox and it installed fine, but once it restarted it boxed me into the top left corner of my screen, I can not change the resolution or can find anything about it on VM settings.\n\nA: You need to install guest additions but first do:\nsudo apt-get install dkms \n\nThen:\nClick on file cabinet then vboxadditions and click on run software.\nReboot guest. \n", "Q: Cant get every icons in System settings in Ubuntu14.04 I don't know what's wrong, I can't see any icons in system settings, i'am using Ubuntu 14.04, how can i get it back.

Assuming you're using the desktop, have you tried right-clicking on the little speaker icon in the system tray and selecting 'Sound Settings'? You can do a lot of basic troubleshooting in this area. Looks like you have pulseaudio installed, which should simplify things. From this window, under the 'output' tab, you should see a list of your soundcards. You can click the 'test' button on each to generate some audio.\nMake sure, of course, that you have your speakers plugged into the right card! You have multiple cards in your machine, and if pulseaudio is choosing one you don't use by default, that could be the whole problem right there. You may want to research your make and model of pc to see which sound card corresponds to which audio output jack.\nAnother way to troubleshoot is to get some audio playing in an application, then open your unity dash and type pavucontrol. Launch the PulseAudio Volume Control application. Under the 'playback' tab, you should see a list of software audio sources. Find the one playing your audio, and the output meter should be moving. It will display the sound card being used, and you can click on this button select from your different sound cards. Make sure, again, that any sound card you're choosing actually has the speakers plugged into it. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to set directory permission in linux which prevents users (except owner) to delete file but allow them to modify content?

This depends on what you actually want to achieve.\nSElinux may help too, but it seems that combination of SElinux and Samba would rise more questions than solve them. Rock-bottom: applying more rules create more quirks one could easily overlook.\nMy experience with this kind of problems shows that if you need more fine-grained access than OS/File System allows you to do it is often wiser to think of a custom security model and write an application that has access system you need. Perhaps use databases.\nI am also curious if someone else resolved this problem in some acceptable way and if s/he did what would be conceptual boundaries.\nhere is a question that would bother me: if someone else can edit my file (effectively being able to delete whole content) - what would be difference between this and actually deleting a file?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 wired connection not detecting dual booted Windows with Ubuntu a few weeks back.

Or if you're lazy:\nwget http://ffmpeg.gusari.org/static/32bit/ffmpeg.static.32bit.latest.tar.gz\ntar xzvf ffmpeg.static.32bit.latest.tar.gz\n\nThen execute the binary: ./ffmpeg -i input ...\nCompile ffmpeg\nAnother option is to compile. It takes more time, but allows you to fully customize your build. See Compile FFmpeg on Ubuntu, Debian, or Mint.\nmc3man's PPA\nSee Ubuntu Multimedia for Trusty.\n\nExample command for MP3 encoding\nffmpeg -i input -codec:a libmp3lame -q:a 4 output.mp3\n\nExample command for stream copy\nIf your flv input already contains MP3 audio (ffmpeg will tell you), then you can simply re-mux instead of re-encode:\nffmpeg -i input -codec:a copy -map 0:a output.mp3\n\nAlso see\n\n\n*\n\n*Who can tell me the difference and relation between ffmpeg, libav, and avconv?\n\n*FFmpeg Wiki: MP3 Encoding Guide\n", "Q: Not able to authenticate during sofware installation When I try to install a package through Software Centre, an authentication window pops up.\nThe authentication window is like this:\n\nBut the window disappears immediately and I am not able to authenticate.\n\nA: I installed policykit-1-gnome .

This is not working well, because after wake up from suspend, ext4 will frequently try to write to the root file system before USB is ready.\nHere is what I see in the kernel log when this happens, notice how I get a bunch of I/O errors on sda1, and then one second later the USB storage drive is finally detected by the kernel.\n[ 2826.517419] wlan0: associated\n[ 2826.517452] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): wlan0: link becomes ready\n[ 2827.575371] EXT4-fs warning (device sda1): ext4_end_bio:317: I/O error -5 writing to inode 1733735 (offset 0 size 0 starting block 12629950)\n[ 2827.575380] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 12629694\n[ 2827.575400] EXT4-fs warning (device sda1): ext4_end_bio:317: I/O error -5 writing to inode 3148603 (offset 0 size 8192 starting block 12844470)\n[ 2827.575404] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 12844212\n[ 2827.575411] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 12844213\n[ 2827.575448] EXT4-fs warning (device sda1): ext4_end_bio:317: I/O error -5 writing to inode 3015015 (offset 0 size 90112 starting block 6588832)\n[ 2827.575453] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 6588576\n[ 2827.575461] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 6588577\n[ 2827.575465] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 6588578\n[ 2827.575469] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 6588579\n[ 2827.575473] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 6588580\n[ 2827.575477] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 6588581\n[ 2827.575481] Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 6588582\n[ 2828.857284] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] No Caching mode page found\n[ 2828.857293] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through\n\nAt first there is no visible indication outside of the kernel log, that the problem has triggered, but if I let Ubuntu stay running beyond this point, then the file system will get errors and eventually switch to read only mode. At that point I have to reboot into recovery mode and run fsck.ext4 manually from a root shell in order to repair the file system.\nIs there some setting I can change such that access to the root device after waking from suspend can be delayed until the USB drive is ready?\n\nA: The reason this problem is only seen with USB devices and not with other devices is a combination of two factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB storage unlike other storage media relies on kernel threads for operation.\n\n*When resuming from suspend, the kernel wakes up all threads simultaneously.\n\n\nThe outcome is that during resume there will be a race between the USB system on one hand trying to detect media and syslog on the other hand trying to write log messages from suspend and resume to disk.\nIf syslog happens to attempt a write before the USB device has been detected ext4 gets an error, which for some reason isn't handled cleanly and eventually the file system will need fsck to be run manually.\nThe solution I found was to give kernel threads a 12 second head start before other threads are woken up. These are the changes I had to make to the kernel in order for that to work:\n--- linux-3.13.0/kernel/power/suspend.c.orig    2014-01-20 03:40:07.000000000 +0100\n+++ linux-3.13.0/kernel/power/suspend.c 2014-08-04 00:57:43.847038640 +0200\n@@ -299,6 +299,8 @@\n        goto Resume_devices;\n }\n\n+unsigned int resume_delay = 0;\n+\n /**\n  * suspend_finish - Clean up before finishing the suspend sequence.\n  *\n@@ -307,6 +309,15 @@\n  */\n static void suspend_finish(void)\n {\n+       if (resume_delay) {\n+               /* Give kernel threads a head start, such that usb-storage\n+                * can detect devices before syslog attempts to write log\n+                * messages from the suspend code.\n+                */\n+               thaw_kernel_threads();\n+               pr_debug(\"PM: Sleeping for %d milliseconds.\\n\", resume_delay);\n+               msleep(resume_delay);\n+       }\n        suspend_thaw_processes();\n        pm_notifier_call_chain(PM_POST_SUSPEND);\n        pm_restore_console();\n--- linux-3.13.0/kernel/sysctl.c.orig   2014-08-04 08:11:26.000000000 +0200\n+++ linux-3.13.0/kernel/sysctl.c        2014-08-03 23:27:23.796278219 +0200\n@@ -277,8 +277,17 @@\n static int max_extfrag_threshold = 1000;\n #endif\n\n+extern unsigned int resume_delay;\n+\n static struct ctl_table kern_table[] = {\n        {\n+               .procname       = \"resume_delay\",\n+               .data           = &resume_delay,\n+               .maxlen         = sizeof(unsigned int),\n+               .mode           = 0644,\n+               .proc_handler   = proc_dointvec,\n+       },\n+       {\n                .procname       = \"sched_child_runs_first\",\n                .data           = &sysctl_sched_child_runs_first,\n                .maxlen         = sizeof(unsigned int),\n\n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu within Windows 8.1, BIOS based When I try to install Ubuntu via bootable USB drive, it displays at the boot time, no operating system detected.\nAnd after that I tried to extract ISO image file of Ubuntu but that too didn't work saying \"cannot download metalink and therefore the iso\" even if I place ISO and Wubi in same folder.\n\nA: You can create USB Boot disk in either Startup Disk Creator or Unetbootin:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup Disk Creator\nNote: Startup Disk Creator is included to Ubuntu, so you need either run Ubuntu (on other computer) or boot any machine from USB or CD/DVD Live.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Unetbootin\nUnetbootin exists for Linux, Windows, Mac\n\n", "Q: Problem Allowing Memory With Adobe Flash Player in Firefox Whenever I try to play a game, like Pillage the Village using Firefox, a flash window pops up asking me to allocate some memory.

This is Ubuntu version independent - it will affect you if you have 12.04 or 14.04.\nTaken from this article on OMG Ubuntu\n\nOlder versions of Skype will stop working; they won't be able to sign into ...the service.\nWhy? Microsoft says they “…want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer – from enhanced quality to better reliability to improved security – and the newest version of Skype is the way to do that.”\n\nIt is quite hard to keep support for older systems for a long time - it limits development.\nHere is the latest (4.3) release. It says it is for 12.04, but it works fine on 14.04\nMy pronouns are He / Him\n", "Q: ways of calculating required disk space prior to package download The following is no duplicate of How to determine the size of a package while using apt prior to downloading?, it is more an additional question.\nConsider the following two implementations to get the required disk space:\n#!/bin/bash\necho n | sudo apt-get install $LIST | grep \"disk space\" | awk '{ print $4, $5 }'\n\nand\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPACKAGE_LIST=$(dpkg --get-selections | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep -v -e \"-dbg\" | cut -f1 -d\":\")\n\ngetsize () {\n   size=$(apt-cache --no-all-versions show $1 | grep Installed-Size | awk '{ print $2 }')\n   ((NEEDED+=$size))\n}\n\nfor package in $LIST; do\n   getsize $package\n   DEPENDENCIES=$(apt-cache depends $package | grep Depends | awk '{ print $2 }')\n   for dependency in $DEPENDENCIES; do\n       if [[ ! $PACKAGE_LIST =~ [^.[:alnum:]-]\"$dependency\"[^.[:alnum:]-] ]]; then\n          getsize $dependency\n       fi\n   done\ndone\n\necho \"$NEEDED kb\"\n\nIn theory they should return similar results, but for big packages in $LIST they return very different results, the second implementation returns much bigger results (for example 13.5 GB vs 16.2 GB). \nI know the second implementation is slower, because it tries to do the job of apt-get in bash, which is a lot slower, but my intention of writing the second version was to get the result in kb, because I was not able to find out how to get the result in kb from the first implementation, mainly because apt-get scales the unit, from bytes up to gigabytes and I do not know, whats the biggest unit it considers. \nCould someone help me find out why there is such a big difference?\n\nA: Thanks for all the input, I ended up with the following:\nNEEDED_SPACE_KB=$(echo n | apt-get install $INSTALLABLE_DEBUG_PACKAGES | grep \"disk space\" | awk '{ print $4, $5 }' | sed 's#GB# * 1000 MB#; s#MB# * 1000 #; s#kB##; s#B# /1000#;' | bc)\n\n\nA: The first seems to be accurate.\nThe second one looks like it might be considering the size of all the dependencies instead of the needed dependencies.\napt-cache depends\n\nbrings up all dependencies.\nExample:\nIf I were to install \"potrace\" I would only need \"potrace\" and \"libpotrace0\" but the list of dependencies from apt-cache depends also brings up \"libc6\" and \"zlib1g\" which are both already installed on my system.\n\nA: I assume little packets are not asked for input Yes or No and are not shown with the size after first running of the script. That's why your script probably may take long time sometimes and show confusing calculation.\nAnyway I wrote this script in order to get always total size in kB.\n#!/bin/bash\nLIST=\"openarena chromium-bsu\"\necho n | sudo apt-get install $LIST | grep \"disk space\" | while IFS=, read a b; do echo $b ; done  | \nsed 's/,//g' |\nwhile IFS=\\  read a b c; do \nif [ \"$b\" == \"kB\" ]; then echo $a $b;\nelse\n if [ \"$b\" == \"MB\" ]; then echo -n $(($a*1024)); echo \" kB\" \n fi\nfi\n done\n\nproduces:\n454656 kB\nEDIT: Explanation for the first sentence about size:\nI mean that for little packages(I can't remember a threshold of size) apt-get doesn't ask fro Yes or No, so for them echo N is pointless for the next times the script is running because apt-get will install them and it will show the package size only first time of running the script, other times you run the script such little packages are already installed and you are missing their size in calculation. That is partially answers why it takes long time sometimes. \n", "Q: Cannot add a new user I am trying to add a new user to my ubuntu 14.04 os.

Now, I am using Ubuntu 14.04 with gnome-shell 3.12.1.\nI was trying to find shortcut for toggling language but it couldn't work and my grave accent key (`) is also disabled.\nNow, whenever I am pressing this key on my keyboard, it works as Esc key. Can some-one tell me how can I configure it?\nCan some-one tell me how can I define a key-board shortcut key for input languages-toggling.\nWhen I am pressing command \"xev -event keyboard\" then it opens a small window and in that if I press grave key (`)  then the output is as:\nKeyPress event, serial 28, synthetic NO, window 0x4000001,\n    root 0x2bb, subw 0x0, time 2422193, (366,566), root:(368,710),\n    state 0x0, keycode 49 (keysym 0xff1b, Escape), same_screen YES,\n    XKeysymToKeycode returns keycode: 9\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (1b) \"\"\n    XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (1b) \"\"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 28, synthetic NO, window 0x4000001,\n    root 0x2bb, subw 0x0, time 2422339, (366,566), root:(368,710),\n    state 0x0, keycode 49 (keysym 0xff1b, Escape), same_screen YES,\n    XKeysymToKeycode returns keycode: 9\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (1b) \"\"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\n\nA: You need to remap the key to Grave. \nThis is taken from this answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*xev will output some information about the pressed key. The third line is important. It should look similar to:\nstate 0x10, keycode 49 (keysym 0xff55, Escape), same_screen YES,\n\nin this example Escape is the name of the behaviour the key is assigned to at the moment, the number keycode is the internal id to recognize the key.\n\n*now when you want to change the keys use xmodmap.\n xmodmap -e \"keycode 49 = grave\"\n\nThis changes the key with keycode 49 on your keyboard to the key grave. It's pretty simple. Unfortunately, this loses the ~ char.\nTo allow the ~ key, you have to assign it to a modifier. The modifiers are, in order:\n(no modifier key used is implied as first)\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock        Caps_Lock (0x42)\ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3      \nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\n\nSo we want it to be ` when there is no modifier (item 1) and ~ when there is a modifier. The command is:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 49 = grave asciitilde\"\n\nasciitilde is the ~ key.\nYou can also set it to change with caps etc, so if I wanted | when caps is on, you use:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 49 = grave asciitilde bar\"\n\nbar is the `| key.\nNote: These change are for the active X session only and will be lost after reboot.\nWhen you want to save the changes permanently you have to run the following commands after the ones above:\nxmodmap -pke >~/.Xmodmap\n\n(it creates a file named .Xmodmap in your home directory (~))\nThen you have to create a file named .xinitrc in your home directory where you put command xmodmap .Xmodmap in.\nsource: Ubuntu Foruns\n\nA: I find I can do the correct accents quite simply using the compose key. \n\nThe grave à is achieved by pressing (in my case) the Right Windows key RtWinthena then the `¬|  key in succesion (top left of keyboard next to the 1!  key) and not necessarily together, just one after the other.\nThe other accents are just as logical. The least obvious is ç which is RtWin key then c then comma ,.\nI hope that helps and that I have understood your requirement properly.\n", "Q: Microphone - external sound card noise suppression I have the same problem as described here, so I tried to solve it with procedure in reply. When everything was installed I changed files according to reply and restarted computer. When computer rebooted I opened up pavucontrol and looked to input devices. I found out that mentioned fix for background noise works only for internal sound card, not for external.\n\nIs there a possibility to enable noise/echo cancellation for external sound card - in image is listed as Audio Adapter Analog Mono?\n\nA: In my case the headphone appears in the port list for \"Built-in Analogue Stereo\" itself and I can choose it in pavucontrol to let echo-cancel use it.\nFor your case I think you may need to explicitly point echo-cancel to the external source. You can specify the \"source_master\" argument to the module as per the documentation here.\nSo find out the name of the external source pactl list sources | less, then search for required external device e.g. \"Audio Adapter Analog Mono\" as above (there might be entries for monitor devices for that as the description will show so skip those; the real device will have \"alsa_input.\" prefix in name). Get the name of the required external device and add to the line in /etc/pulse/default.pa:\nload-module module-echo-cancel source_name=echosource aec_method=webrtc source_master=alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\n\n(change the name in source_master as found before). I couldn't find a way to change this to internal mic or back to external mic dynamically other than unloading+loading module again using pactl/pacmd.\nBTW, in my case the noise cancellation takes a few seconds to take affect and first few seconds in Skype have noise which smoothens out quickly.\n", "Q: My GNOME 3 looks different? I am a Ubuntu newbie. I followed this tutorial to install Gnome 3 on my Ubuntu Precise Pangolin.  \nI was expecting a desktop like this:\n\nand I ended up with a desktop like this:\n\nPlease tell me what I can do to get the desired desktop.   \nNB: I have dual-booted using Wubi.\n\nA: That looks like GNOME Classic. You should choose GNOME when selecting the session at login: (screenshot from the tutorial)\n\nIf you still get GNOME Classic, you can force GNOME Shell by running these commands in a terminal:\ngnome-shell --replace &\ndisown\n\nThis will replace the current WM, send GNOME Shell to the background and detach it from the terminal so that you can close it without killing gnome-shell.\n\nA: Maybe the GNOME Shell you installed isn't compatible with your current Ubuntu version, so it fallbacks to the classic mode. GNOME Shell 3.4 is officially supported by Ubuntu Precise. Although it's a bit old, it's guaranteed to be stable and usable. \nFirst of all, remove the PPA from Software Sources. \nThen, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-shell\nThat should give you GNOME Shell 3.4. If you need 3.10 or above I think you should update your Ubuntu to 14.04. \n\nA: I think the first screenshot is what you get if you press the Super key, not the desktop. But it's been a while since I used Ubuntu Gnome.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi not working with my router but works with other access points I recently bought a D-Link router and configured it.\nFrom my Android, the access point is providing full internet access.\nMy Ubuntu laptop gets internet access from other access points.\nThe problem is I cannot get internet access with just my router (I also had tried connecting to a router some time back and had this same problem, but I switched to ethernet then).\nI can connect to the network, but if I try pinging the router I get a Destination Host Unreachable error.\nI cannot discover my router with nmap either. nmap just gives my own computer (not even the Android device).\nEthernet connection to my router works perfectly fine.\nHere are the configurations:\nprakhar@aS4v4g3wOrld:~$ sudo iwconfig wlan0\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:\"aRM4g3ddOn-2.4GHz\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point: C4:A8:1D:8C:99:AC   \n          Bit Rate=52 Mb/s   Tx-Power=200 dBm   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Encryption key:off\n          Power Management:off\n          Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-25 dBm  \n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0\n\nprakhar@aS4v4g3wOrld:~$ cat /etc/network/interfaces\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet loopback\n\nprakhar@aS4v4g3wOrld:~$ sudo lshw -C network\n  *-network               \n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter\n       vendor: Broadcom Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:0a:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 01\n       serial: <removed>\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=wl0 driverversion=6.30.223.141 (r415941) ip=192.168.0.100 latency=0 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11abg\n       resources: irq:19 memory:d4500000-d4503fff\n  *-network\n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:0b:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 07\n       serial: <removed>\n       size: 1Gbit/s\n       capacity: 1Gbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=full firmware=rtl8168e-3_0.0.4 03/27/12 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=MII speed=1Gbit/s\n       resources: irq:43 ioport:2000(size=256) memory:d4404000-d4404fff memory:d4400000-d4403fff\n\nprakhar@aS4v4g3wOrld:~$ sudo ifconfig -a\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr a0:b3:cc:46:93:05  \n          inet addr:192.168.0.102  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::a2b3:ccff:fe46:9305/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:3207 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:4052 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:1858395 (1.8 MB)  TX bytes:662320 (662.3 KB)\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:6960 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:6960 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:594878 (594.8 KB)  TX bytes:594878 (594.8 KB)\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 84:4b:f5:aa:01:bf  \n          inet addr:192.168.0.4  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::864b:f5ff:feaa:1bf/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:68 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:9105\n          TX packets:325 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:10677 (10.6 KB)  TX bytes:38468 (38.4 KB)\n          Interrupt:19 \n\nDetailed info is here.\nI have run out of ideas.

Recheck if you checked with the correct MD5 or redone load from official mirror links. \nIf you downloaded the ISO file from some unofficial sites and the Md5 matches the MD5 provided by the unofficial site BUT doesn't matches the official MD;, it might be modified or infected, or corrupted. \nHope that I helped. \n\nA: The MD5 check verifies that the content of the file you downloaded is exactly the same as it is on the Ubuntu Server.\nIf the MD5 checksum doesn't match the checksum indicated by the download site your downloaded copy got corrupted.\nIf you download it on an infected system the virus can infect it after the successful download and corrupt it. But being realistical a windows virus certainly will not work in a linux environment.\nAnyway a successful md5 check shows you always that the file is correct and not corrupted.\n", "Q: Unable to update from 12.04 to 14.04 using update manager When I type hwe-support-status --verbose I get \"Forcefully disabled hwe-support-status via file /var/lib/update-notifier/disable-hwe-eol-messages. \nWhen I try to update via Update Manager I get a message fetch failed to upgrade.

Do not proceed if you don't want that.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Something else screen (image below), highlight each of your partitions and click on the - minus sign. This will delete the partitions.\n\nYou should be left with a big \"free space\". We'll now proceed to create 4 partitions. Here's what they are:\n\n\n*\n\n*root partition: partition containing important Ubuntu files. This is like the \"C\" drive of Windows.\n\n*home partition: partition containing your user data. This is like the \"C:\\Users\" folder of Windows. Yes, that \"folder\" is going to be on a partition of its own.\n\n*games partition: partition containing your games.\n\n*swap partition: an important partition for Linux that helps with memory/RAM.\n\n\n*Highlight the free space and click the + sign:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick 102400 for size (that's 100 GB)\n\n*Primary\n\n*Use as ext4\n\n*Mount point /\nThat's the root partition.\n\n*Highlight the free space and click the + sign:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick 204800 for size (that's 200 GB)\n\n*Primary\n\n*Use as ext4\n\n*Mount point /home\nThat's the home partition.\n\n*Highlight the free space and click the + sign:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick 200704 for size (that's 196 GB)\n\n*Primary\n\n*Use as ext4\n\n*Mount point /media/games\nThat's the games partition.\n\n*Highlight the free space and click the + sign:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't pick anything for size. It'll use the remaining space. This should be 4 GB\n\n*Primary\n\n*Use as swap area\nThat's the swap partition.\nThere's no \"standard size\" for a swap partition, but generally, people make the swap partition the same as RAM, that's why I've set it to 4 GB.\nYou can play around with the sizes before doing anything. I changed the root partition to 100 GB instead of the 200 GB you had for the C drive in Windows. That way, you have more space for Games, but you can switch the root back to 200 GB if you want, and leave 96 for Games if you don't have much. I just think that 200 for root is too much. The root partition contains the important files of Ubuntu and programs you install. Just remember that it will be touch (or a long process) if you choose your partitions now and then want to resize them later =/, so design wisely.\n\nA: The Ubuntu installation uses the whole disk space available. So the first step for you would be to save your personal data from your HDD somewhere else.\nComing from windows you need to learn some new concepts for partitioning on linux.\n\n\n*\n\n*the whole system is organized in one folder. the root folder \"/\"\n\n*different partitions would be integrated into the system with subfolders. \nlike \"/home\" for all user data or \"/games\" for a special partition to contain games.\n\n\nThe next step is that you should learn to distinguish physical drives and virtual partitions with lvm .\nThe lvm manager can create you different virtual partitions within your physical hard drive. It has the advantage that the partitions can be changed later on.\nthese partitions will be conected to the folders with the \"mount\" command.\nyou can lookup the organization of your partitions and where they are connected to your system in the file system in the \"/etc/fstab\" file and with the \"df -m\" command.\nI hope that helped you somewhat.\n", "Q: Installing Samsung m2020 printer I have found relevant PPD files but it gives me this when I try to print\nPrinter 'Samsung-M2020-Series' requires the '/usr/lib/cups/filter/rastertospl' program but it is not currently installed.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Samsung M2070, tried all the commands to make it work with ppd file, but the printer did not work and I had the same message.\nThe solution was, that I deleted the printer via localhost:631 and downloaded the samsung drivers again.

It integrates, but again, if I type in my password when asked for, the same issue persists. Here is a screen shot:\n(asking for password:)\n\n\n(after right password is given:)\n\nI tried following this answer partly(I deleted goa-1.0 but not evolution since it would delete my evolution configuration which I want!) But deleting goa-1.0 didn't let me integrate my google account at all and so it doesn't work!(I recreated goa-1.0 and now I can reintegrate my account but the password issue persists).\nSo now my question is: How do I integrate my google account with my Ubuntu GNOME without any such issues as explained above?\nPS:- Should I be doing something with seahorse here? I dunno how it works and all and so if I have to use it, tell me what to do elaborately.\n\nA: It's a known bug: #1353951.\nIt will be fixed with the last version of evolution-data-server (still in 'proposed').\n\nA: From Google's help:\n\nGoogle may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do\n  not use modern security standards. Since these apps and devices are\n  easier to break into, blocking them helps keep your account safe.\nSome examples of apps that do not support the latest security\n  standards include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The Mail app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 6 or below\n  \n*The Mail app on your Windows phone preceding the 8.1 release\n  \n*Some Desktop mail clients like Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird\n  \n\nYou have two options:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Option 1: Upgrade to a more secure app that uses the most up to date security measures. All Google products, like Gmail, use the latest\n  security measures.\n  \n*Option 2: Change your settings to allow less secure apps to access your account. We don't recommend this option because it might make it\n  easier for someone to break into your account. If you want to allow\n  access anyway, follow these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to the \"Less secure apps\" section in My Account.\n  \n*Next to \"Access for less secure apps,\" select Turn on. (Note to Google Apps users: This setting is hidden if your administrator has\n  locked less secure app account access.)\n  \n  \n\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem. I tried to integrate my google calendar into Gnome calendar, but setting up google online accounts caused the problem described here.\n- I had to remove google online account from Gnome\n- Set up Evolution to use my google account including google calendar\nProblem solved.\nG\n\nA: This seems to be a known issue with GNOME accounts integration feature. To solve this issue, for the time being, one might use evolution instead of integrating one's account with GNOME. \n\nA: I had the same issue in Ubuntu 14.04. I thought that I had corrected it by deleting the failing account and reinstalling the account information. However, the problem came back.\nSo I looked harder and found that somehow an account setting had changed (damn gremlins!).\nHere's a check. \nIf your system starts prompting for a password and won't accept the one you enter, edit the settings for the account that is failing (edit->preferences->edit).  \nUnder Receiving Email, check the Authentication pull-down. If it says Password, that's the problem because Password is not a valid selection. \nClick Check for Supported Types and select the one that does not have a line through it.\nRestart Evolution and check it out. \n\nA: Try allowing less secure app from below link:\nhttps://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps\nFound this answer from reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/7qeq6y/how_to_fix_issue_with_google_login/dsosg2s?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n", "Q: How long for a stable installation for Ubuntu 14.04? I know that when a new release is published it means that is  tested for a long time, but during the first weeks it happened to discover some bugs, and going on the bugs are decreasing.\nI installed 14.04 on my notebook just yesterday and I will make some tests on and I know I will solve any problems with internet help.\nI would like to install Ubuntu on old relatives pcs, but I would like to give them pcs where they can have fun with no problem (or very few ones)...\nWith a lot of amazement I discover that a lot of user suggest to install Ubuntu 12.04 that seems more stable than the lastest version. I think it is not a stupid idea, but I do not need to pass to Ubuntu quickly, so I prefer to wait for the new version (14.04).\nThe question is: when it will be the right moment for Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: The right moment for 14.04 is now - it has been updated to point release recently. I would suggest to use only LTS releases of Ubuntu, and install them right after point update release.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 was released in April of this year, should be stable, and currently receives the most up-to-date software. If there are bugs they will be fixed. Ubuntu 14.04 is supported until April 2019.\nUbuntu 12.04 was first released in April 2012, and has since been receiving updates. It could be thought of as more stable as it has been around for longer and most bugs should be fixed, though it might not get as up-to-date software. It is supported until April 2017.\nYou can find the currently supported releases here, it also had releases notes for each release and point releases (e.g. 12.04.4, 14.04.1). If you are concerned about minimum hardware requirements, 14.04 and 12.04 should have mostly similar requirements - this question covers this in more detail.\n\nA: As your friends suggested 12.04 is pretty much bug free as of now. The same cannot be said for 14.04. There are bugs that go back as far as April. So we can only wait and see how long it takes. (Scroll through some of the unanswered questions and try to tell me alot of them are not bugs for 14.04)\nAs far as hardware support is concerned, 14.04 is the better choice.\n\nThe problems and bugs that need to be worked out don't seem to be issues you will find yourself dealing with months or even weeks from now. From what I've experienced, if there are bugs that effect your specific hardware, you will know very soon after installation. Most of the 14.04 problems I've dealt with were encountered during setup, installation, and initial configuration of the OS along with applying the first fresh set of software updates. \n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 is officially released on 17 April 2014.

From the usability point of view, I do not understand why on each release upgrade you have to manually patch all the URLs of apt in order to make them point to the newer distribution.\nWhy is not possible for apt to auto-detect the current and use it, so when you upgrade there is no need to upgrade the urls anymore?\n\nA: \nI do not understand why on each release upgrade you have to manually\n  patch all the URLs of apt in order to make them point to the newer\n  distribution.\n\nYou do not have to do this. (Not typically, anyway.) Actually, in Ubuntu, manually changing release names in sources.list is not a supported way to upgrade, and may often not work.\nWhen the package manager checks to see what package versions are available to be installed or upgraded to, /etc/apt/sources.list and any configuration files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d are consulted to discover which software sources are configured. This includes but is not limited to information about what release is installed, and occasionally (though not usually!) it even makes sense to have software sources configured for releases other than the one you are running.\nWhen you upgrade to a newer Ubuntu release using a supported method (such as the Software Updater / Update Manager or the do-release-upgrade command), the release names in sources.list are changed automatically. Some software sources, such as PPAs, may instead be disabled.\nOne of the reasons Ubuntu's package manager doesn't just check which release is installed and use that information dynamically to determine what software sources to use, is that there is no one thing that is the release you are running. Normally, which Ubuntu release you're using (e.g., 14.04) is well defined. But during a release upgrade, and under some other circumstances (some pathological and others proper), you may have a mixture of different releases.\nIn order for Ubuntu to get the point in a release upgrade where you are really, truly, and definitively running the next release (i.e., the release upgrade target), or even to the point where commonly used indicators like the contents of /etc/lsb-release would indicate the target release, it must first change what software sources are configured (to those of the target release) and upgrade, install, and remove packages to reflect what is provided by those software sources.\n\nA: Not every repository you add needs to be an official Ubuntu one. Take for example Oracle Virtualbox: at each Ubuntu release, the repository is updated with some days (or weeks) of delay. But in the meantime, the \"old\" repository works just fine. Being able to state which release you want to query in this case is essential.\n\nWhy is not possible for apt to auto-detect the current and use it, so when you upgrade there is no need to upgrade the urls anymore?\n\nThis is done automatically both from the GUI (sudo update-manager) and from the command line (sudo do-release-upgrade) for what concerns official repositories. You can do it manually, but you don't need to.\n", "Q: message disk drive for /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present even after trying various options I have tried the advice here:\nPuny geek including the last amendments.\nand here\nAskubuntu including the advice further down for 14.04\nI am running Xubuntu 14.04 on an older system.

Most of the examples provided to fix this problem has been for cases where the swap was encrypted. In order to get it to work I followed the steps provided here Askubuntu except I did not encrypt the swap. ie the following changes:\ncomment out all references to /dev/mapper/cryptswap... or whatever the swap drive in named in the /etc/fstab.\nand do not do the last step of encrypting the swap:\nsudo ecryptfs-setup-swap\n\nUpon reboot I get no drive not present errors. Be careful between boots as the partition names /dev/sdXX 's often change between boot sessions and don't assume swap is still named the same. This cost me the formatting of a backdrive to linux-swap as the drive name changed to what used to be the swap partition. Always check with something like sudo fdisk -l to see what the swap partition is called.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me.\nI followed the instructions in your original link as well: \nWhat to do about \"the disk drive for /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present\"?\nThen I randomly found a comment somewhere else that the UUID of the swap partition can change between reboots.  So, opening  /etc/crypttab, I replaced the long UUID string with the partition name, which has always been consistent for me:\ncryptswap1 /dev/sda3 /dev/urandom noauto,swap,offset=8,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nThen I ran this little number again:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nAfter a reboot, it finally worked!  Maybe it will randomly stop working eventually, but considering that I haven't found another solution that works for me, I'm fine with that.\n", "Q: issues with the marlin-devs repository I'm trying to install marlin file manager on ubuntu 14.04.\nI add the repository \nadd-apt-repository ppa:marlin-devs/marlin-daily\n\nthen when I 'apt-get update' i get this little gem:\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/marlin-devs/marlin-daily/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages 404 Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/marlin-devs/marlin-daily/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages 404 Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I did it and it worked fine.  Now that I've upgraded my Ubuntu to 14.04, Firefox 31.0 is dragging like crazy...very slow and unresponsive.  So I'm getting ready to try this with 14.04.  I don't see why it wouldn't work for 14.04.\nHere's the link\nhttps://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/how-to-install-previous-versions-of-firefox-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/\nOne precaution, though.  Almost immediately after the older version starts up, it will likely automatically update to the newest version!  As soon as you start up the older version, you have to go to Edit > Preferences > Advanced button > Update tab...\nand uncheck the \"automatically download newest version\" box.  If you don't get to it fast enough, I couldn't figure out how to interupt the download and installation. I tried again and just moved faster on it and got the box unchecked before it could start the upgrade and it worked.\nIt's all terminal commands so I assume if it's not going to work on 14.04, a bad command error will let me/you know.\n", "Q: Audacity Stop Record Freeze As the title reads, after recording audio, and pressing the stop button, audacity freezes.

Here it is :\nI installed Sublime text 2 following this tutorial : http://www.technoreply.com/how-to-install-sublime-text-2-on-ubuntu-12-04-unity/ \nI replicated all the steps except step 4 that I changed by using this command instead : ~/.local/share/applications/sublime.desktop\nEverything works fine apart from the fact that when I click on the shorcut icon or when I start sublime text with a command line, it does not open a new file but my sublime.desktop file.\nCan somebody help me understand why it does that ?\nThanks in advance\nPierre-Victor\n\nA: You haven't made the .desktop file executable.\nRun the command:\nchmod +x /usr/share/applications/sublime.desktop\n\n", "Q: Qt 5 configuration I have a problem setting Qt5 apps correctly on my computer.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 with KDE4, I have configured the look in the KDE system settings and that look is used in every qt4 apps and gtk apps, but not in qt5 apps. \nThe most annoying think is that I use double click to activate item, but in qt5 apps this is ignored and items are activated with single click.\nDoes anybody know how can I change the default Qt5 setting?\nI have tried deleting my .kde folder, moving it to .kde4, tried different configurations in KDE system settings, tried to find qtconfig for Qt5 (which seems not to exist anymore) and even installed daily build of KF5 and used the KDE5 system setting where I set theme, coloring and mouse behaviour and even that was ignored in Qt5 apps.\nI know that Qt5 will tried to use the system settings automatically - that is the reason why there is no qtconfig, but it just not working at all. \nSo here I'm asking for anybody help on this topic or at least some info how to configure Qt properly or to say it better: how to configure qt5 at least somehow.\nAlso I'm using the ubuntu's QT5.2.1 but I also installed QT5.3 from Qt website but the behaviour is the same in both version\n\nA: Unfortunately Qt5 designers removed the package equivalent of qt4-qtconfig in Qt4.\nThey leaved as well quite a big bug behind as Qt5 ignores the font-config of the system.\nThere is then no way around to \"correct\" the font used by Qt5.\nTo get some applications behave like the others on my desktop I had to recompile them with Qt4 whenever possible.\nThus bug is now reported as closed in Qt5 version 5.4 on Aug. 20, 2014 ...\nHowever, at this moment there is no Debian nor Ubuntu packages available from Qt5 version 5.4, even in the “Canonical Qt5 Edgers” team PPA.\nAlthough I found a Qt5 Configuration Tool on http://qt-apps.org website, still this app requires Qt5 version 5.4.0.\nI hope Ubuntu will backport this version to Trusty 14.04 LTS one day ...\n\nA: Qt5 style\nYou could edit the Qt application look by using the Style sheets.\nhttp://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication\nAll Qt programs automatically support the following command line options:\n-style= style, sets the application GUI style. Possible values depend on your system configuration. If you compiled Qt with additional styles or have additional styles as plugins these will be available to the -style command line option. You can also set the style for all Qt applications by setting the QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE environment variable.\n-style style, is the same as listed above.\n-stylesheet= stylesheet, sets the application styleSheet. The value must be a path to a file that contains the Style Sheet.\n\nNote: Relative URLs in the Style Sheet file are relative to the Style Sheet file's path.\n-stylesheet stylesheet, is the same as listed above.\n-widgetcount, prints debug message at the end about number of widgets left undestroyed and maximum number of widgets existed at the same time\n-reverse, sets the application's layout direction to Qt::RightToLeft\n-qmljsdebugger=, activates the QML/JS debugger with a specified port. The value must be of format port:1234[,block], where block is optional and will make the application wait until a debugger connects to it.\n\nMore of the Style sheets: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/stylesheet.html\n\n*http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/stylesheet-examples.html\nQtCurve\nThe latest QtCurve /1, 2/ has widget style for applications based on the Qt 5.x.\nThe QMPlay2 (Qt5) /3/ with the native Qt5 and the QtCurve widget styles:\n\nLinks\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/QtCurve/qtcurve\n\n*https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/base/qtcurve\n\n*http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/QMPlay2?content=153339\n", "Q: tar commands returns stdin error tar -xvfz files.tgz\ngzip: stdin: not in gzip format\ntar: Child returned status 1\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n\nThis the error i got.\n(This file is created by tar -cvzf file.tgz file )\nMoreover i can able to extract this same in another ubuntu server.

This is Transmission BitTorrent Client:\n\nWhat does the \"Seeding to 3 of 4 connected peers 7kB/s ▲\"?\nWhat is seeding and what are peers? And why does this only appear after it has downloaded? Before it says \"Downloading from 60 of 60 peers - 785 kB/s ▼\"\n\nA: Some torrent terminology:\n\n\n*\n\n*Peer: A user who is participating in the torrent.\n\n*Seeder: A peer who keeps the torrent available for uploading. They can be the people who initially uploaded the torrent or those who have finished downloading it and kept it alive.\n\n*Seeding: To keep a torrent alive for uploading once you have finished downloading (either the bits you want or the complete torrent).\n\n\nUsually, peer just means a peer who isn't a seeder. \nIn this case, you are seeding. You have a target Upload/Download ratio of 2.0 on both torrents. Once you have uploaded twice as much as you downloaded for the torrent, the application will cease seeding that torrent.\n\nA: Seeders are the peers who have completed downloading the file 100% \nA seed is a peer that has a complete copy of the torrent’s contents and keeps uploading it.  That can be done by leaving the task running after completing the download.  The more seeders there are, the better the chances of getting a higher download speed.\nPeers are people who are downloading the file off the seeders, they also upload a parts of the file too. \nRunning torrent clients that transfers data to and from other clients, is called a peer. A peer does not have the complete file; only parts of it. \nSometimes peers are also called leeches, which mean downloaders.  \nsome information courtesy of ABIT.CDA11\n", "Q: Can't use the internet over wifi My Macbook 3,1 can connect to my router, but cannot use the connection.

Now, wait for a while(actually just 8-10 seconds). \nNow go to the panel and click on the network icon there. Select Enable Mobile Broadband there and after that all you need to do is select your mobile partner and other things. If your mobile partners name or APN(ACCESS POINT NAME) isn't available there, you'll need to search for your network service provider's access point name.\nAfter you are done with all these steps you should be able to see your network's name in the network indicator of the Ubuntu panel. And you should be able to use your laptop as a hotspot as well.\nThis trick won't work for receiving messages from your network provider. It's just an alternative for the time being. You'll need to install Dongle's Software and for that you should follow the instructions provided in the software package from the vendor (there should be a READ ME file somewhere).\n", "Q: Two Ubuntu Machines cannot access each other's shares anymore I have two Ubuntu laptops, both running 14.04 \"Trusty Tahr\".

However, something happened when I was trying to add a third Ubuntu 14.04 machine into the mix, and now none of the computers can see each other on Nautilis -> Browse Network (or Dolphin, for that matter).\nI have Samba installed and updated on both machines. They're all on the same WAN, and they're all configured to the \"PAWSHARE\" workgroup. (Resetting to \"WORKGROUP\" does not fix it.) When I updated Samba today, I went ahead and overwrote the old configuration files, just in case something borked, and reconfigured the workgroup.\nYet, I still see nothing. I've browsed Google for hours over the past few weeks, trying to solve this, and yet nothing works. At last check, I can ping one laptop from another successfully.\nI'm at the end of my rope, now.

I'd like to do something like that with Ubuntu. Specifically, I plan to download music torrents but, just in case, I'd like to set things so that nothing can execute from the download folder. Is there some way I could do that? Alternately, maybe I could run the torrent program and the download folder under a completely different user and section it off from the system?\n\nA: EDIT: Most would say my answer is overkill, which it is, but if you are unfamiliar with Ubuntu permissions, I'd rather you use overkill than turn you computer into a worthless brick.\nYour alternative is probably a good idea, if you are worried about the content you are downloading. Open your terminal (CTRL + ALT + T), and do:\n\nsudo adduser NEWUSERNAME\nsu NEWUSERNAME\nmkdir -p ~/Downloads\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo chown -R NEWUSERNAME:NEWUSERNAME ~/Downloads\nsudo chmod -R ~/Downloads 600 \n\nWhat that will do is create a new user, add a Downloads folder under that new users home. We make sure the owner and group is only the new user, and that there are only READ & WRITE permissions by the new user in that folder. \nUbuntu, and all Linux systems are much safer when it comes to the traditional Windows threats, clicking links, and running programs. Windows uses exe files, which can be downloaded and launched as soon as you click a link. \nYou should definitely set your browser preferences to \"ask every time\", where to download files. That way you will see the type of file being downloaded when Ubuntu asks you where to download the file. exe files, any scripts -> (*.sh), or other odd or suspicious files... \"JUST SAY NO!\" ...Just hit cancel.\nAlso, if you have a file with no file extension, or any file, you can check it out by doing: \n\ncat filename\n\n...and look for any suspicious scripts within its content.\nLastly, after downloading a file, it may have different permissions from where it was downloaded, so you can run this again, just to be safe:\n\nsudo chmod -R ~/Downloads 600\n\nYou can check the Owner, Group, and permissions for Owner, Group, and Others within a directory or for a file using: \n\nls -al\nls -al FILENAME\nls -al DIRECTORYNAME\n\nThis explains permissions with both letters and numbers: http://www.draac.com/chmodchart.html\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: On upgrade from 13 to 14, wifi no longer works I had Ubuntu 13 and wifi worked great.

Use the same Live USB/DVD you had used before to boot your computer. Choose the \"Try Ubuntu\" option. Do not choose Install Ubuntu!\nSecond\" Start Gparted\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Dash, the gray Ubuntu icon on the top of the Launcher\non the left margin of the desktop.\n\n*Type gparted\n\n*Click on the Gparted icon that shows up\n\n\nThird: Make sure the main window is showing your hard drive you want to adjust.\nGparted should show the two partitions you created and the free space.\nFourth: Move and resize\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the Swap partition to the very end at right side by dragging\nit, if needed.\n\n*Drag the right edge of the / partition as close to the Swap\npartition as it would go. There may be a small gap of 1MB or so in\nbetween. This is normal.\n\n\nFifth: Apply\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify again that you are editing the correct partition and not the\nLive USB or some other hard drive.\n\n*Click the Apply button in Gparted to actually do the work.\n\n\nWait till everything completes this is very important. If you stop the process in between your computer will not boot and you will have to install Ubuntu again.\nFinally: Reboot\nWhen prompted remove the LiveUSB/DVD and boot Ubuntu normally from the hard drive.\nIf you want a separate /home partition\nFollow the first three steps as before. That is:\nFirst: Reboot your computer using the Live USB/DVD/CD\nSecond\" Start Gparted\nThird: Make sure the main window is showing your hard drive you want to adjust.\nFourth: Move swap to the end\n**Create a new partition in the unallocated space of the format ext4. Verify and write down the device name of this partition. It should be something like sda3. The actual name may be different. \nFifth: Apply\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify again that you are editing the correct partition and not the\nLive USB or some other hard drive.\n\n*Click the Apply button in Gparted to actually do the work.\n\n\nWait till everything completes this is very important. If you stop the process in between your computer will not boot and you will have to install Ubuntu again.\nSixth: Reboot\nWhen prompted remove the LiveUSB/DVD and boot Ubuntu normally from the hard drive.\nSeventh: Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T\nGet the UUID of the new partition by entering \nsudo blkid\n\nin the terminal.\nNow you just need to take note (copy & paste into a text-file) the uuid of the partition that you have set-up ready to be the new /home partition. \nEighth: Setup fstab\nYour fstab is a file used to tell Ubuntu what partitions to mount at boot. The following commands will duplicate your current fstab, append the year-month-day to the end of the file name, compare the two files and open the original for editing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Duplicate your fstab file:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n*Compare the two files to confirm the backup matches the original:\ncmp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n*Open the original fstab in a text editor:\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\nand add these lines into it\n# (identifier)  (location, eg sda5)   (format, eg ext3 or ext4)      (some settings) \nUUID=????????   /media/home    ext4          defaults       0       2 \n\nand replace the \"????????\" with the UUID number of the intended /home partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save and Close the fstab file\n\n\nthen type the following command:\nsudo mkdir /media/home\n\nThis command will create a new directory, later used for temporarily mounting the new partition. At the end of the procedure this directory can be removed.\nNow you can restart your machine or instead of rebooting you might prefer to just re-load the updated fstab \nsudo mount -a\n\nEither should have mounted the new partition as /media/home. We will edit the fstab again later so this arrangement of the partition is only temporary.\nNineth: Copy your original home to the new home\nNext we will copy all files, directories and sub-directories from your current /home directory into the new partition:\nsudo rsync -aXS --exclude='/*/.gvfs' /home/. /media/home/.\n\nThe --exclude='/*/.gvfs' prevents rsync from complaining about not being able to copy .gvfs, but I believe it is optional.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my machine since long. I installed \"Skype 4.2 for Linux\". It was working fine till yesterday night. But today when I tried to log-in to skype I'm not able to do it. An error message \"Skype can't connect.\" is displaying when I press Sign in button after filling the Skype Name and Password. I'm damn sure about the Skype Name and Password I'm entering are correct. I tried with the same credentials on a machine running on Windows 7. I was able to log-in over there. \nTo resolve this issue I tried almost everything, from removing Skype completely to install Skype again and again from 'Ubuntu Software Center', 'By downloading latest Skype .deb file and running it on my machine', 'Disabled the firewall', etc. but every time the result is same.\nFor your information I'm also attaching the screen shot of the error message to this question.\n\nSo can some one help me in this regard please? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: According to OMG Ubuntu \n\nOlder versions of Skype will stop working; they won’t be able to sign\n  into ...the service.\nWhy? Microsoft says they “…want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer – from enhanced quality to better reliability to\n  improved security – and the newest version of Skype is the way to do\n  that.”\n\nThat's the reason you're facing such problem. Don't worry the latest Skype 4.3 is now available in the Ubuntu Partner repository, so just install the update and you'll be fine.\n", "Q: Can't connect to the wifi I have ubuntu 14.04 and when  I want to connect to the wifi my network manager found nothing and when I use this command   \n\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan\n\nIt can find my essid wifi and when I use this command to connect  \nsudo iwconfig wlan0 essid \"sample\"\n\nNothing happen and I can't connect neither my ifconfig command show this   \neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b8:88:e3:0e:03:49  \n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n          Interrupt:16 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:1576 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:1576 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:131573 (131.5 KB)  TX bytes:131573 (131.5 KB)\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:ed:b9:fa:1f:3b  \n          inet6 addr: fe80::aed:b9ff:fefa:1f3b/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:29\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n          Interrupt:17 \n\nMy wifi device is broadcome :\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM43228 802.11a/b/g/n  \n\nThis is the text file of that script for my wifi information  \nText File Contain My Wireless info\nWhat should I do to connect to the wifi??\n\nA: I found the solution for my problem just edit one file:  \nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nand just change the value of false to true\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\ndns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=true\n\nAnd solved \n\nA: First change the wpa/wpa2 encryption to just wpa2 (CCMP)(AES) not (TKIP) if you have that option it will work best.\nSecond set your wireless channel in the router to 1 or 11 then save the router configuration and reboot it.\nThird go into network manager at top right corner of the screen and click on edit connections>wireless tab and set IPV6 to ignore.\nFourth shutdown your computer and unplug your usb wireless device so your internal wireless can work then reboot, if it does not connect then post a new file without usb wireless plugged in.\n\nA: Using the kernel driver, you won't be able to connect unless your 20ft within range of the router.\nIf you want your usb wireless device to work (rtl8192cu) properly, you may want to install the proprietary driver with the following commands: \nsudo apt-get install git build-essential linux-headers-generic dkms\n\ngit clone https://github.com/dz0ny/rt8192cu.git --depth 1 \n\ncd rt8192cu\n\nsudo make dkms\n\nAnd use the following to load the driver\nsudo modprobe 8192cu\n\nNotice this module uses \"8192cu\" instead of \"rtl8192cu\" to load.\nFinally,update your /etc/modules folder accordingly with this command:\necho '8192cu' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nWith this driver you get full 300Mb/s instead of 150 and there is full encryption suport as well.

I just used Powerbroker to join it to my domain, but it doesn't create a new profile when I log in as my domain user, which also happens to be \"dan\", because the folder dan already exists. I removed the part where the login assumes the default domain sudo /opt/pbis/bin/config AssumeDefaultDomain true, so I'm forced to log in as domain\\dan -- thinking it would create a folder in my home directory as domain.dan or domain\\dan -- similar to how Windoze does it, but it still logs into my local/original user \"dan\" even if I log in as domain\\dan.\nI renamed my existing /home/dan to dan-old, and I can now log in as my domain user, so I am wondering how to make it so Powerbroker creates a special kind of \"domain\" folder in my home directory. I believe when I set it up, I used the following command sudo /opt/pbis/bin/config HomeDirTemplate %H/%U to create the home folders. Can I add another variable so it appends something to the home folder so I can differentiate between a local user and domain user?

I tried some of them, but they didn't work. The last try I gave was this post here. After doing that, I rebooted the laptop.\nWhen my OS loaded I could not see the card in my network manager (same as after the \"Bill Gates curse\"), but now my internal card had disappeared as well... I tried to reinstall its drivers but nothing happened... This is the point where I am at now. I don' t really know what to do. Any help will be greately appreciated :).\n(English is not my native language, so please excuse any mistakes)\n\nThese are the results from the wireless_script after fixing the issue with the internal card:\n########## wireless info START ##########\n\n##### release #####\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS\nRelease:    12.04\nCodename:   precise\n\n##### kernel #####\n\nLinux matrix 3.2.0-58-generic #88-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 3 17:37:58 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n##### lspci #####\n\n08:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I've been doing jmeter tests and have had a few OutOfMemoryExceptions, so I've bumped up the heap memory in JMeter. But now it seems I can't run anymore tests as it says I'm using 94.9% of 14Gb.\nWhen I use df -h it says dev/sda1 is full\nI was wondering if anyone can help me? I think it has to do with the JVM from the jmeter\n\nA: Start by tracking down where the excess usage is being stored.  If you have no idea, start from the mountpoint for /dev/sda1:\nmount | grep sda1\n\nUse the du command.  If /dev/sda1 is mounted on /  (\"root\"):\ndu --max-depth=1 --human-readable / | sort --human-numeric-sort\n\nThis will list the first level of directories contained in the specified path, in order from smallest to largest. You can increase the depth past 1 to get details of the subdirectories, or change the path to specify a single directory.  You can also use the short flags.\nFor instance, if your username is ubuntu and you want to inspect your home directory:\ndu -d1 -h /home/ubuntu | sort -h\n\n\nA: In some cases, it could be coming from Jenkins or Docker. To solve that, you should clean Jenkings logs  and set it's size. \n\nA: In my case, running the command\nsudo apt autoremove\n\nsolved the problem.\n", "Q: I want to install Gnome on kubuntu 14.04 is it safe? I'm new to linux and exploring diffrent things. Anyway. If I installed Gnome on my kubuntu 14.04 will Gnome remove or replace the packages I installed?\n\nA: As a new Ubuntu user, it's probably better to make a new partition where you can install Ubuntu Gnome, assuming you have the space. Otherwise, you are likely to face a system that, while not technically broken, still frustrates you in several ways.\nYou may also want to make an additional partition where you can test out the combination. You can always delete it and reclaim the space later if you work out any resulting problems from combining the two desktops.\nMost noticeable will the fact that the alternatives system will change the default boot splash screens and login greeter to the Gnome versions. These can easily be changed back, however. You can find several answers about this point on the site.\nYou will also end up with additional programs installed to handle common functions, such as video playback or media burning. This is not a problem beyond disk space or cluttered menus, but I've seen a lot of questions where people complain about this.\nMore problematic, however, will be the possibility of subtle conflicts among various desktop and UI elements that affect behavior or the look and feel. Some of these, such as the look of gtk programs under kde are often easily fixed by installing certain packages and changing some settings. Others, however, are harder to pin down and remain the subject of various unanswered questions.\nI don't want to veer off into opinion, but it seems safe to say that as the different desktop environments advance, the incompatibilities are growing.\nInstalling Gnome should not literally remove anything that you already have installed. This would only happen if there were packages to be installed that are in conflict with existing packages. I'm not aware of any conflicts at this level. Plus, if that were to happen, the package manager would warn you and give you the chance to abort the installation.\n", "Q: Ubuntu grub menu after installing CentOS? I am currently dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04, and would like to get some familiarity with linux server admin. I plan to install CentOS and maybe host a small website or something. What will happen to grub after installing CentOS?\n\nA: You'll need to reinstall/update grub. I had the same issue after installing CentOS 6.4 on top of my Ubuntu 14.04. Following this post fix my problem:\nhttp://muthusaravananmca.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/ubuntu-grub-recover-after-installing-centos-or-windows/\n(Just to clarify that in Step 4: use \"--root-directory ...\")\nHope it helps.\n\nA: If everything is using EFI, it won't have much effect.\n\n\n*\n\n*CentOS will make itself first in the boot order. You can change that back to Ubuntu by using your EFI system menu.\n\n*Once you have set Ubuntu back to first in the boot order, run sudo update-grub to add CentOS to your grub menu.\n\n*If you have any trouble getting into the EFI system menu, you can also boot into Ubuntu from the CentOS grub menu, reinstall grub with sudo grub-install /dev/sda, and follow that with sudo update-grub. Re-installing grub will set Ubuntu first in the boot order and updating will add the new OS to the boot menu.\n\n\nIf everything is in legacy mode using MBR, things will work out much the same; but it's just a little more cumbersome to keep things set the way you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you install CentOS or any new OS, if there is an option to not install a bootloader, use it. (CentOS using the new Anaconda installer should have that option, although it may be a little tricky to find.) \n\n*If you can't avoid installing a bootloader, try to install it to the same partition where you are installing the new OS. This will prevent it from overwriting the MBR.\n\n*In either case, after installing boot into Ubuntu and run sudo update-grub to add the new OS to the boot menu.\n\n*If you cannot use either of the above options or simply forget and overwrite the MBR, use the new OS's boot menu to boot into Ubuntu then reinstall grub with sudo grub-install /dev/sda, and follow that with sudo update-grub. \n\n\nA: I had a corrupted boot configuration for Centos 7 and installed Ubuntu 18 in an effort to get grub up & running.  Windows 10 was found but not Centos by either update-grub or the boot repair package/utility under Ubuntu.\nOn the other hand, when I used the Centos 7 rescue utility to get their version of grub running & Centos back up (https://www.tecmint.com/recover-or-rescue-corrupted-grub-boot-loader-in-centos-7/), \nthe following command found Ubuntu w/ no problem (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/152222/equivalent-of-update-grub-for-rhel-fedora-centos-systems) :\ngrub2-mkconfig -o \"$(readlink /etc/grub2.conf)\"\n\nAnd so I now have a tri-boot system : Windows 10, Centos 7 & Ubuntu 18 :)\nConclusion : when in doubt, user Centos' grub2-mkconfig to pick up your bootable systems.\n", "Q: change link on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OSXApplicationsEquivalents there is a link on this page that is broken:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/OSXApplicationsEquivalents\nthe link for Gnome Do under the Quicksilver category links redirects to porn/flash games. I made an account and logged in to change it, but it says the page is immutable. I do not know how to contact someone to change the site. Please tell me what to do, or fix it yourself.\nThe correct link is: http://do.cooperteam.net/\n\nA: Most likely the page was immutable because it was being edited by someone else. But apparently not to fix this problem; the spam link you noticed was still there.\nAlternatively, I think sometimes users log in, but are redirected to a page where they are still not logged in and cannot edit. Clicking to log in again usually fixes that (immediately, and without requiring reauthentication).\nI've verified that this was really a spam link as you say, and that the correct link you've provided is indeed correct.

However, in this case, it appears your intention may have been to report a problem. Problems with documentation that you're unable to fix yourself can be reported as bugs, as dobey says.\nI believe ubuntu-website is the correct package for reporting bugs/problems in the Ubuntu help wiki, http://help.ubuntu.com/community/, since the other obvious possibility, ubuntu-community-website is specifically for http://community.ubuntu.com.\nProject descriptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-website: \"The main ubuntu website, the wiki and associated sites.\"\n\n*ubuntu-community-website: \"Theme, bugs, and other resources for community.ubuntu.com\"\n\n\nOther relevant resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to report a bug in content (not interface) on Ubuntu.com?\n(In which Jorge Castro explains, \"Website (including content) issues should be reported against ubuntu-website.\")\n\n*ReportingBugs (on the wiki) and How do I report a bug?, though they're focused toward reporting bugs in Ubuntu software rather than other Ubuntu-related projects.\n", "Q: Google maps brings down performance, even after close I'm using Ubuntu 12.\nGoogle maps are very slow on my laptop, but even when I close browser (Chrome or Chromium), the performance goes down significantly.

It listens on a network interface (without using 'promiscuous' mode) and catches all conversations of MAC address to IP request. It then compares the mac addresses it detected with a pre-configured list of authorized MAC addresses. If the MAC is not in list, arpalert launches a pre-defined user script with the MAC address and IP address as parameters. This software can run in deamon mode; it's very fast (low CPU and memory consumption). It responds at signal SIGHUP (configuration reload) and at signals SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGABRT (arpalert stops itself).\n\nsudo apt install arpalert\ncp /etc/arpalert/arpalert.conf ~/.config/  # read it for more info\n\narpwatch (apropos arpwatch/dpkg -L arpwatch | grep bin for its commands) could also help with those arp spoofing attacks.\n\nWith nmap:\nnmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24\n\nWith ip (modern alternative to arp):\nip neigh show\n\nWhere 10.0.0.0/24 is your LAN mask, check ip addr. -sn: Ping Scan - disable port scan (check nmap man page).\n", "Q: 14.04.1 md5sums The official checksum page only goes until 14.04.

I believe gnome shell sets the cursor position in the \"hot corner\" of the screen,\n-at login-, to open the activities gui, after login.\nI do not want this.\nI'd like to have my cursor positioned \"center screen\" at login.\nI'm thinking I'd need to modify a file...?\nIt's cursor position... not theme.\nThanks in advance.\nstanz\n\nA: Intro\nWhat you might want to do to solve your issue is split into three steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool.\n\n*Create a shell script which uses xdotool to position the cursor center-screen when run\n\n*Run this script on gnome startup\nI can assist with part 1 and part 2. Part 3 I will drop some advice on, but I cannot test that advice personally as I do not use the gnome de.\nPart 1\nTo install xdotool, you need to enable Ubuntu's universe repository in the apt package manager.\nIf you have Ubuntu 14.04, this should have been enabled by default when you installed your system.\nIf you feel this may not be the case, or if you have manually disabled the repo yourself, please enter the following commands into a terminal window (accessed by pressing ctrl + alt + t) to enable it:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo apt-get update\nFollowing this, to install xdotool, simple enter the following command into a terminal window\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\nPart 2\nYou can create this script wherever you like, but I will be using the Documents directory of your home folder for this example.\nAdditionally, you will have to source your own screen coordinates for the script. I will be using 960x540 because this is the center of my 1920x1080 resolution screen.\nTo get the center of your screen, find the resolution e.g. 1280x800, and half the width and height.\ne.g.:\n1280/2 = 640\n800/2 = 400\nSo for a 1280x800 screen you would use 640x800.\nTo create a script that will position your cursor in the center of the screen when run, do the following:\nEnter the command nano ~/Documents/cursorcenter.sh\nCopy/paste the following into the terminal window (which has prepared to create the file cursorcenter.sh in your Documents folder upon saving):\n#!/bin/bash\nxdotool mousemove --sync 960 540\nPress ctrl + x then press y then press enter to save the script.\nFinally, to make the script 'executable', enter the following into a terminal window:\nsudo chmod +x ~/Documents/cursorcenter.sh\nYou can test that your script works by running sh ~/Documents/cursorcenter.sh in a terminal window. If all goes according to plan, your cursor should jump to the center of the screen!\nPart 3\nTo run your script on startup, you simply have to stick the command sh ~/Documents/cursorcenter.sh into whatever script gnome runs as it starts up.\nIf you are using Gnome3, you should be able to make this script run on start up by sticking it in the ~/.config/autostart/ folder.\nTo do this, run mkdir ~/.config/autostart && mv ~/Documents/cursorcenter.sh ~/.config/autostart/cursorcenter.sh in a terminal window.\nEDIT\nIf you want to delay the running of xdotool, so that it waits until after whatever time gnome moves the mouse by, put a sleep [time in seconds] line in the script to be run.\nFor example, the entire script might look like:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 10\nxdotool mousemove --sync 960 540\nThis would wait 10 seconds before positioning your cursor center-screen.\n", "Q: Ubuntu deleted windows 7 I have downloaded ubuntu 14.04 and trying to install it on my laptop, but after installation completed, I seen that ubuntu deleted my windows 7. i never permitted to do so. then why it happens.

I guess it's a missing option, but which?\nBoth platforms are Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: I believe it has something to do with the fact that apt-get autoremove is being run in a non-interactive shell. See Is it possibe to answer dialog questions when installing under docker?\nThe solution appears to be to prefix the command with DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive:\nssh <remote_srv> \"DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get autoremove\"\n\n\nA: Alex's solution does suppress errors, and he almost got the cause right, but it does not allow you to answer any questions (which is fine when you have preseeded the answers and are running from a script, but real annoying when you are trying new packages). The core issue is an interaction between the assumptions made by ssh and debconf's various frontends.\nLet's start with ssh.  ssh assumes that when you do not specify a remote command you want a pty on the remote end and that you specify a remote you don't (which works remarkably well 90% of the time, just not this one). This can be overridden by the -t option which forces a pty or the -T option which forces no pty (or the corresponding config file options). Further when using a pty the TERM environment variable is copied (exceptions may apply check documentation for completed details and official sweepstakes entry form). Also of note the -x option disables X11 forwarding and -X enables it.\nDebconf itself has no interactivity requirements (by design), but the various frontends do, and each one has different requirements.\nI believe the best looking frontend is gnome (there is also a ked front end that I did not get working). The gnome frontend (and the kde one as well) requires some non-default libraries and a X11 server, therefore the command line to force the gnome frontend (once the appropriate libraries are installed) would be\nssh -X <remote_srv> \"DEBIAN_FRONTEND=gnome apt-get autoremove\"\n\nor if you prefer kde\nssh -X <remote_srv> \"DEBIAN_FRONTEND=kde apt-get autoremove\"\n\nThe dialog frontend (the default) requires a pty and a terminal with a minimum level of functionality specified in the TERM variable (in practice this is anything with a complete terminfo description except dumb).\nssh -t <remote_srv> \"TERM=$TERM DEBIAN_FRONTEND=dialog apt-get autoremove\"\n\nor\nssh -t <remote_srv> \"apt-get autoremove\"\n\nthe readline frontend has less stringent requirements and will work with dumb terminals, but will need a pty.\nssh -t <remote_srv> \"DEBIAN_FRONTEND=readline apt-get autoremove\"\n\nThe editor frontend depends on an editor which would have specific requirements depending on the editor.\nssh -t <remote_srv> \"DEBIAN_FRONTEND=editor EDITOR=vi apt-get autoremove\"\nssh -X <remote_srv> \"DEBIAN_FRONTEND=editor EDITOR=gvim\\ -f apt-get autoremove\"\n\nThe noninteractive frontend has no requirements but it does not ask any questions (which may or may not be what you want).\nssh <remote_srv> \"DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get autoremove\"\n\n", "Q: no wired connection and wirewireless disabled I am new to Linux kubuntu 14, i tried installing kubuntu 14.04 without internet connection which went smoothly, when i finish installing i was surprise to get a network or connection icon with a red sign showing wireless disable.\nSince i have been battling with all kind of solution to fix this problem i can't just find any, i went to internet point and also try to connect ethernet wire it didn't work also can someone help me. when i run \nlspci -nn \n\nI get \n02.06.1 Firewire (IEEE 1394) [0c00]: Texas instruments PCIxx12 OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 Host Controller [104c:803a]\n02.0e.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Broadcom corporation BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX [14e4:170c](rev 02)\n10.00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN [14e4:4311] (rev 01)\n\n\nA: Do:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source \n\nThen:\nsudo modprobe -v ssb\nsudo modprobe -v b44\n\nyour ehternet should come on, give it a minute then do:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nReboot\n", "Q: Cant boot up from an external source anymore , please help.....(Totally a different sceenario from the usual cases ) Am a Ubuntu user and quiet good with it, have been using it for like a year.

But you should still be able to boot from it, through your \"BIOS\" boot menu. Most computers' firmware has a boot menu that can be accessed by pressing or holding a particular key while starting up your computer. Another key will enter the firmware setup utility itself; the default boot order can be changed there.\nOften F12 is the key to access the \"BIOS\" boot menu and F2 enters the \"BIOS\" setup. This is the case for most Dell computers, and some others with similar firmware. I don't know what current Packard Bell machines use. You can likely find this by searching, or just try all the common keys. The common ones are Escape, Delete, and the twelve function keys.\nIf you are able to select the USB flash drive to boot from but it still will not boot, then further troubleshooting will be required:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you write an Ubuntu desktop ISO to a USB flash drive and boot from that?\n(If so, the problem relates to the Windows ISO, flash drive, or the way it was written.)\n\n*How did you write the Windows ISO to the USB flash drive? Note that, unlike an Ubuntu ISO image, a Windows ISO image is not designed to work \"out of the box\" when written to a USB flash drive; additional data, to make the USB flash drive bootable, must be written.\nSee How can I create a Windows bootable USB stick using Ubuntu?\nSince you have no working operating system, if it turns out you also have no working bootable media, you may need to use a different computer to create such media.\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS will no longer download updates The machine is a newish one using the 64 version.

The list of dependencies should include each library that your software directly depends on. The reason for this is that your binary requires that library, and exactly that library, to link correctly when run. Suppose that you try to optimise this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Your program depends on libX and libY\n\n*libY depends on libX\n\n*So you try to minimise this by specifying a dependency to only libY\n\n\nNow what happens if the author or package maintainer of libY changes their code to no longer depend on libX? Your package will break. It breaks because you made a false assumption - that libY will always depend on libX. That assumption is not valid - the dependencies of packages can and do change over time. So if your program needs libX, you need to specify that.\nThe good news is that the list of shared libraries can be generated automatically using dpkg-shlibdeps:\nhttps://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html#s-dpkg-shlibdeps\n\n8.6.1 Generating dependencies on shared libraries\nWhen a package that contains any shared libraries or compiled binaries\n  is built, it must run dpkg-shlibdeps on each shared library and\n  compiled binary to determine the libraries used and hence the\n  dependencies needed by the package.[66] To do this, put a call to\n  dpkg-shlibdeps into your debian/rules file in the source package. List\n  all of the compiled binaries, libraries, or loadable modules in your\n  package.[67] dpkg-shlibdeps will use the symbols or shlibs files\n  installed by the shared libraries to generate dependency information.\n  The package must then provide a substitution variable into which the\n  discovered dependency information can be placed.\nIf you are creating a udeb for use in the Debian Installer, you will\n  need to specify that dpkg-shlibdeps should use the dependency line of\n  type udeb by adding the -tudeb option[68]. If there is no dependency\n  line of type udeb in the shlibs file, dpkg-shlibdeps will fall back to\n  the regular dependency line.\ndpkg-shlibdeps puts the dependency information into the\n  debian/substvars file by default, which is then used by\n  dpkg-gencontrol. You will need to place a ${shlibs:Depends} variable\n  in the Depends field in the control file of every binary package built\n  by this source package that contains compiled binaries, libraries, or\n  loadable modules. If you have multiple binary packages, you will need\n  to call dpkg-shlibdeps on each one which contains compiled libraries\n  or binaries. For example, you could use the -T option to the dpkg\n  utilities to specify a different substvars file for each binary\n  package.[69]\nFor more details on dpkg-shlibdeps, see dpkg-shlibdeps(1).\nWe say that a binary foo directly uses a library libbar if it is\n  explicitly linked with that library (that is, the library is listed in\n  the ELF NEEDED attribute, caused by adding -lbar to the link line when\n  the binary is created). Other libraries that are needed by libbar are\n  linked indirectly to foo, and the dynamic linker will load them\n  automatically when it loads libbar. A package should depend on the\n  libraries it directly uses, but not the libraries it only uses\n  indirectly. The dependencies for the libraries used directly will\n  automatically pull in the indirectly-used libraries. dpkg-shlibdeps\n  will handle this logic automatically, but package maintainers need to\n  be aware of this distinction between directly and indirectly using a\n  library if they have to override its results for some reason.

The card worked fine in my Panasonic DMD-GX1 camera, and mounted fine in Windows 7 with no errors. I ran CHKDSK in Win7, no problems reported. I then used a sector editor to see if the FAT32 \"dirty bit\" was set. It was not. I then did a Windows 7 \"quick format\", ejected the card, and then inserted it in the built-in card reader of my Ubuntu 14.04 box (HP Pavillion p6720f) that had previously refused to mount it. It mounted fine. I ejected the card, placed it in the camera, took several pictures, and returned it to the Ubuntu 14.04 card reader. It mounted fine and all the pictures were accessible. I then un-mounted the card, returned it to the camera, and formatted it in the camera. Being careful to turn the camera off, I removed the card and tried to mount it in Ubuntu. Once again, it would not mount. Took it to the Windows 7 box, quick formatted it, and returned to Ubuntu where mounted fine. I repeated taking some pictures, it mounted fine and the picture files were all there. Formatting the card in the camera once again made the card unmountable, even though the card and picture files were readable in Windows 7. \nIt seems that some cameras formatting routines are not compatible with Ubuntu 14.04, although I don't see any problems at the point were a \"dirty bit\" is expected in FAT32. As much as I hate to even turn my Windows 7 box on, it seems to resurrect these \"unmountable\" cards. I have confirmed that formatting with Canon cameras seems to be no problem, but formatting on my Panasonic DMC-GX1 always causes a fail with Ubuntu 14.04.\nFor what it's worth, maybe this will provide a clue to other people that are formatting SD cards with other types of devices and experiencing mounting problems with Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: You can boot with Live CD to narrow the problem down. If the SD card works in there then this means it's something wrong with your software (operating system, drivers, configurations). If it's now working under Live CD then this means it's a hardware failure in your card reader, does it read other cards well?\n", "Q: Encrypted drive (full disk encryption) gone after upgrade to 14.04 I'm in a bit of a pickle.

Even in event systems like Upstart where you can wait for starting-x, you're still outside the X environment and you lack things like the DISPLAY variable. That's obviously a huge issue for things like xrandr where you need an X server.\nThankfully X (or I should say the script that loads X) will look for an ~/.xsession file when it starts. This is a perfect place to lodge commands like this. It has to be executable and contain a proper launch stanza. We can do all of this in one command:\ninstall -b -m 755 /dev/stdin ~/.xsession << EOF\n#!/bin/sh\nxrandr --output VGA-1 --gamma 3:3:3 --brightness\nEOF\n\nJust paste that in and it should create the file.

There are some shells (and even modifiers existing shells like zsh)  that aim to pull in some of the PowerShell features but even if they're syntactially identical, the underlying data you're using just won't be the same.\nIn short: if you need to use Windows, use Windows. And you do.\nThat said, that doesn't mean you have to reinstall Windows properly. It could temporarily languish in a virtual machine (see VirtualBox). Easy to install, easier to remove, can't touch your existing setup. It'll be a bit slower than a native install but given you're just playing around with a command line, that doesn't seem like an issue at all.\n\nA: PowerShell is available on Linux. \nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell\nThere's even a beginners guide:\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/learning-powershell/powershell-beginners-guide.md\n\nA: for those who still needs it - MS made a move: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powershell-is-open-sourced-and-is-available-on-linux/\nPowerShell on Linux, SSH to Windows box, the Dream...\n", "Q: Okular opens large pdfs with blank pages I can't open large files (above 10MB) with Okular.

I renamed the file and reopened it and it displayed the pages normally again, but unfortunately without the highlighting... i don't think that Okular can handle such large files, mine was 90MBs\n", "Q: How to adjust top menu bar size? I accidentally clicked something that enlarged the top menu bar. I have no idea how I did this but just want to change it back. Picture included below:\n\nA: For new user and Tweaking purpose, unity-tweak-tool is very helpful to change such settings.\nCan be installed by following command:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nGoto Appearance>Font :\n\nIn you can customize following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Default font : Ubuntu 11\n\n*Text scaling factor : 1.00\n\n*Or Restore Defaults to set default settings\n\n\nA: I was unable to change the font size of the top bar text using the suggestion from @Pandya, but I did find an alternative. For Ubuntu 18.04, go to Settings > Universal Access and then enable Large Text. This changes the top bar text (as well as window title bars) \n\nA: Download ubuntu tweak. Here are the instructions for ubuntu 14.04.\nNow launch it. Under the Tweaks tab select the text button. Now, the first option will be Text Scaling factor. Restore it to default.\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04, activity bar size and fonts become smaller occasionally, I could not find how. In the tweak screen suggested by @Pandya, all are seems normal but when I have changed text scaling factor from 1.0 to 1.1, it has become bigger than the default, and reduced 1.1 to 1.0 back then bar and content turned the default and visible.\n", "Q: is it possible that i deleted my files while trying to delete a symbolic link? I made a symbolic link that points to a 500gb ntfs drive, when i executed the second command it halted for 3 seconds so i terminated it, i have a lot of files on the drive im not sure if it deleted anything \n\nroot@myhost:/home/myuser/Desktop# rm /media/d/ rm: cannot remove\n  ‘/media/d/’: Is a directory root@myhost:/home/myuser/Desktop# rm\n  /media/d/ -r ^C\n\n\nA: I am indeed afraid you have deleted the contents of the drive.\nrm -r /media/d/ will recursively delete anything inside /media/d/, even if /media/d itself is a link. What you should have used is rm -f /media/d, which will only delete the link. THe -f flag is needed because it is a folder, not a file.\nIt probably has deleted quite a lot in those 3 seconds. It will, however, not delete directories itself. If this command would've finished it would have left you with an empty directory structure!  \n", "Q: my computer lags when playing 3d games (Nvidia GeForce 4 MX420) Hello when i try to play 3d games on my computer like tux racer and other games it lags really bad. When i look in additional drivers it doesn't detect new drivers for my machine.\nI'm running lubuntu 14.04 and my graphics card is Nividia Mx 420 my proccessor is a AMD Athlon xp + 2000 1.66 ghz. SO why is my computer lagging?. Thank you for reading this  \n\nA: Firstly: wow, that's 12 year old hardware.\nThen again, Tux Racer is non-demanding and pre-dates your hardware, so it should in theory work fine.\nSupport for your GPU is not baked in to current-generation nVidia proprietary drivers.\nFor your graphics card you'll need to obtain a legacy driver from the 96.43.xx series.\nThis driver was available in some versions of Ubuntu's restricted archive, but doesn't seem to be included anymore (unless it's been renamed?).  You'll probably need to go the route of installing it yourself from nVidia's website:\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html\nInstallation mainly consists of executing the downloaded file to build the driver, then running nvidia-xconfig to set up X to use the driver.  You may find you need dependencies in order to install the driver, but it should let you know about them.\n", "Q: Is viewing system files like \"/sbin/init\" safe? Do I risk breaking my installation of Ubuntu if I view /sbin/init without editing it, say, in gedit? (I'm taking an online Linux course and they mention this and I wanted to see what it looks like.)\n\nA: Yes. It's safe to view any system file(s), especially if you don't use sudo or root.\nprakhar@aS4v4g3wOrld:~$ ll /sbin/init\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 265848 Jul 18 15:16 /sbin/init*\n\nThe owner of /sbin/init is root. The only way you can modify this file is either via logging as root ($ sudo -s) or by giving an editor superuser permissions using sudo.\nBesides, /sbin/init is a binary file, not meant for reading. If you still want to view this, use a hex editor like\n$ sudo apt-get install ghex\n$ ghex /sbin/init\n\n\nA: Sure, you can read it without doing any harm.\nIt's a binary file - if you are interested in the text in it, like program symbols, messages, or version numbers, use strings:\nstrings /sbin/init | less\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\nI*|YB\nGU1q\nnx#$\nBDCE\n#9ym\nlibnih.so.1\n_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable\n__gmon_start__\n_Jv_RegisterClasses\n_ITM_registerTMCloneTable\nnih_watch_new\nnih_alloc_real_set_destructor\nnih_timer_add_timeout\n[ ... many more lines ... ]\n\nTo see the full binary content of the file in a somewhat readable form, use hexdump:\nhexdump -C /sbin/init | less\n00000000  7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.ELF............|\n00000010  03 00 3e 00 01 00 00 00  e9 96 00 00 00 00 00 00  |..>.............|\n00000020  40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  78 07 04 00 00 00 00 00  |@.......x.......|\n00000030  00 00 00 00 40 00 38 00  09 00 40 00 1c 00 1b 00  |....@.8...@.....|\n00000040  06 00 00 00 05 00 00 00  40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |........@.......|\n00000050  40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |@.......@.......|\n00000060  f8 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  f8 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000070  08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  03 00 00 00 04 00 00 00  |................|\n00000080  38 02 00 00 00 00 00 00  38 02 00 00 00 00 00 00  |8.......8.......|\n00000090  38 02 00 00 00 00 00 00  1c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |8...............|\n000000a0  1c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000b0  01 00 00 00 05 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000c0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n000000d0  1c d7 03 00 00 00 00 00  1c d7 03 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n[ ... many more lines ... ]\n\n\nA: Yep, it is fine to just view. Make sure when you click close, you don't save any changes you accidentally made.\nTo be super safe, run the following command:\nsudo cp /sbin/init /tmp/init.copy\n\nthen run:\nsudo gedit /tmp/init.copy\n\nSo you're not viewing the original.\n\nA: You can view but you can't make changes. Do not save on exit init. copy the file first with\ncp /sbin/init /sbin/init.me\n\nthen run \nsudo nano /sbin/init.me\n\nHere you first make a copy of the original file (init.me) then you take a look at init.me and find out what you are searching for. \n", "Q: lubuntu 14.04 - cairo-dock missfunctions I have a fresh installation of lubuntu 14.04 on my acer AspireOne netbook and I wanted to add a dock to it.

I had installed Windows XP on C:\\ drive then install Ubuntu on D:\\ drive. After that I had formatted the C:\\ drive and reinstalled Window XP on C:. However, now I cannot find my Ubuntu and also its disk space.\nI need my D:\\ drive space, how can I find it?  \n\nA: Every partition has its own file system. Windows can use NTFS of FAT, but Linux uses its own ext2, ext3 or ext4. Because Windows can't read ext file system you can't easily access your files on Ubuntu partition when running Windows. On other hand Ubuntu does 'understand' NTFS and FAT so you can mount and access Windows partition when in Ubuntu. \nWhen booting your BIOS searches for boot sector on device you are booting from (hard drive). Every operating system sets up its own boot sector when installed. Newer operating systems check when another boot sector is already in place and then make dual boot. That is simple menu to choose OS from.\nSo if you can't even boot up Ubuntu, Windows has probably written over your Ubuntu boot sector.

If so, you may have hit the infamous Samsung BIOS bug documented in bug #1040557.\nYou might need to reflash the BIOS, comment from that bug report:\n\nThis topic is probably not Ubuntu related, but any UEFI linux distro.\n  What I found out so far: Notebook: Samsung series 3 NP300E5C-A05DE\n  (German), BIOS-ID: RAC, current version: P05RAC\nInstalled Linux Mint 13, MBR mode. Later converted to GPT/UEFI - all\n  seemed ok. Device booted ok, but then I recognized, that I was unable\n  to enter the BIOS Setup with F2 anymore.\nWhat still works: F3 to boot from CD, FAT32-Stick with EFI-Shell v1.0\n  saved as \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTx64.efi (2.0 does not work even if BIOS version\n  is UEFI 2.31)\nMy fix: CD with WinPE, then flash BIOS (if using Samsung Flasher need\n  to remove version check is BIOS is current, or directly use WinFlash)\nWhat's causing this?\nAfter I fixed my BIOS I tried to re-enable UEFI booting my linux using\n  \"efibootmgr\", which instantly messed up my BIOS again (but I need\n  stuff like that twice...)\nSo I messed around with HexEdit and efishell and found 10 - in words\n  TEN - efi boot entries within the Samsung BIOS, that are not even\n  shown in \"efibootmgr\" - the first Entry is \"Setup\", second is\n  \"Recovery\", third is \"CD-ROM\" and so on, so it seems like Samsung is\n  misusing those hidden bootentries for their own stuff, putting the\n  Setup into the first boot entry, which will be overwritten by\n  efibootmgr - explains why it was still booting, but unable to enter\n  Setup.\nSince I found the key assignments to these entries within Samsung\n  related BIOS modules, they are responsible for this non-standard\n  stuff. Thank you, Samsung.\nMy stuff still does not explain complete bricks like others have\n  encountered. But maybe the hint with the version 1.0 efishell might\n  help, or even pressing F3 still helps, if the BIOS is not bricked\n  completely.\nFor all the Linux EFI programmers: Those bootentries are there, but\n  only shown by efishell. Why does the nvram-module in linux not show\n  them? Maybe there is an unusual way to get them from the nvram - if\n  you could check them you should be able to avoid these bricks..\n\n\nA: I don't know if this is enough, but usually there are some service hotkeys to reset the bios to its default values. I have an AMI-bios in my desktop and it resets by holding PageUp when switching the power on. You might google if such a hotkey exists in your bios or look it up in your motherboaard's manual. But I think this only resets the CMOS holding the configuration, it does not change anything in the EEPROM, where the bios program is located (changed only by flashing). If you can open it, removing the small battery on the mainboard for a few seconds-minutes or setting a jumper (see motherboard manual - do NOT just try!!!) should do the same trick.\n\nA: If you have a have Samsung np300-e5c (all versions) and maybe other Samsung laptops, this solution is easy.\nFirst of all, the laptop must boot with F3 key. If you F3 key, you boot from a CD or DVD.\nIf it can start from the CD/DVD, follow these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows install CD for setup.\n\n*Laptop Startup Press F3 then Windows boot on CD.\n\n*Install Windows on the computer.\n\n*Windows want to restart. Take the boot CD (windows install CD) out of the drive, then put the install CD for some Linux distribution (I used Linux Mint) in.\n\n*Press F3 again and the Linux distribution will start.\n\n*And you select (start on HDD).\n\n\nSo Windows continues the setup and finish it. Then you can set up the BIOS update. \nYou can do these steps on a Samsung laptop. It works perfectly.\n", "Q: Is it better to use the UK or USA server?

Please read\n  the official blog entry to learn more about how screen locking\n  works.\nThe result of this functionality is that the user session becomes\n  inactive while the screen is locked. Therefore, the power manager is\n  not authorized to perform certain actions anymore.\nPossible solution are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*enable late locking (it delays the VT switch, enable it via Light Locker Settings > Automatically lock the session when the screensaver\n  is deactivated)\n  \n*disable automatic locking completely\n  \n*change the according upower policy (comment #14)\n  \n\nDisabling light-locker in the Light Locker Settings enables sleep mode, but if your BIOS lock screen is too ugly, open /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.upower.policy/org.freedesktop.upower.policy as root and set <allow_inactive>yes</allow_inactive> to allow suspend and hibernate while the session is locked.\n", "Q: Touchpad not working on Ubuntu 14.04 I am using Dell Inspiron 15R 5521 laptop.\nIt had Ubuntu 12.04 installed at time of purchase.\nEverything was working fine.Then i installed windows in it and now i have removed windows and installed Ubuntu 14.04 .\nThe problem i am facing is that my touchpad is not detected in it.\nI searched on google , askUbuntu but could not get solution to my problem.\nAlso i went through this link (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticsTouchpad) but it did not help.\nCan you please help me here.\nLet me know what other information is required here.\nThanks.\n\nA: My research indicate that your laptop has a SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\nExecute the following command \nxinput list\n\nYou should see a output like the following \n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer            id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech Unifying Device.

Just below the What's New section there is a Recommended For You section.\nCurrently I don't have it enabled, but other than the list of software, what data does it take about what you have installed?\n\n\n*\n\n*Does that list of software include software installed via Synaptic or apt-get?\n\n*Does it take data about the time (or order) of installation?\n\n*What does it use that data for? (Other than recommendations, if any)\n\n*How does it work out what software you might like from that? (For example, does it take just the category, or more in depth categorisation)?\n\n*If I have A installed and it recommends C, and I then installed B, could that mean it might stop recommending C (maybe because B and C are very similar)?\n\n\nA: APT, or Advanced Packaging Tool, basically resolves dependency problems and retrieves the requested packages. It works with dpkg, another tool, which handles the actual installation and removal of packages (applications). APT is very powerful, and is primarily used on the command line (console/terminal). There are, however, many GUI/Graphical tools to let you use APT without having to touch the command line. \nSynaptic is one of the GUI/Graphical tools to use APT. This is what Synaptic Package Manager's website has to say about the same -\n\nSynaptic is a graphical package management program for apt. It\n  provides the same features as the apt-get command line utility with a\n  GUI front-end based on Gtk+.\n\nSo basically both Synaptic and the Terminal do the same thing, ie use APT, with a different interface (GUI and CLI respectively).\nThis is what the Ubuntu Wiki page on Software Center recommendations states - \n\nData we can use\nThe current data we have about people we have is:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*what all other people have installed (new recommender service / popcorn)\n  \n*what all other people are using (zeitgeist/new recommender service/popcon)\n  \n*what specific apps other people like or dislike (rnr)\nThe data we have about the users system is:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*what apps the user has installed\n  \n*what apps the user is using (popcon/zeitgeist)\n  \n*what mimetypes the user is working with (zeitgeist)\n  \n*maybe the SSO ID of the user\n  \n*maybe what apps the user likes (based on his/her reviews)\n  \n*the user's contacts\n\nNow what is funny about this is the use of the word maybe which makes things a bit sketchy.\nBasically what the recommendation server does is that it stores a list of packages installed on the system. Whether it was installed by the software center, synaptic or the terminal is immaterial here since it most probably uses dpkg or APT for the same. I can say this because I haven't used the software center but still get recommendations based on the packages I have installed via the terminal.\n\nStorage\nThe server stores the list of each participant's installed packages, and a cache of the recommendations generated for them.\nServing\nWhen sent a request containing the UUID, the server returns a Json list of packages representing the recommendations for that UUID.\nThere will be a REST API call that involves the UUID and that will return the recommendations in some format that s-c can understand.\n\nUltimately, the Software Center is also a GUI/Graphical tool for APT.\nHowever, a few of the points you have raised come under the category of Unresolved Issues and no information is given as to how the recommendations exactly work, ie the algorithm.\n\nUnresolved issues\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*How do we cater for people whose computer is used by multiple people? Should we add local username to the UUID to ensure it's unique (when\n  some or all of the users don't have an SSO account?\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*It's an interesting question what people would expect here. If I have a dedicated game machine and productivity machine then we should have two different recommendations. If OTOH I have a laptop and a desktop that I use for the same things the recommendations should be the same. Hopefully the system can work it out from the context.\n  \n  \n*Does the algorithm take software ratings into account as well as whether it is installed? Is it less effective if someone has never rated software\n  themselves (i.e. Users without an SSO account)?\n  \n*What if someone reinstalls Ubuntu?\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*So we should probably do periodic \"ping\" (even if the system does not install/remove software a ping to tell the server that its still in use) with the UUID to be able to remove no longer valid UUIDs over time.\n  \n  \n*One interesting point though is bootstrapping the dataset, that is, what recommendations to serve until we have a reasonable amount of data on the server. In the case of recommendations based on reviews we already have a decent amount of reviews up there to start review—based recommendations. For recommendations based on installed packages otoh, we'd need to start receiving data for a while before we can start\n  making useful recommendations.\n\nIt is best to contact the developer(s) or the team at Canonical who have designed the software center recommendations for the most accurate answer.\nThat said, I feel that the recommendation system is not that intelligent as it recommends popular packages, which many other users have installed, rather than lesser known but similar packages, which may actually be of more relevance to the user.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run Ubuntu installer from hard drive partition? I would like to prepare something like recovery partition on the PC hard drive. Such recovery partition should contain only Ubuntu installer, nothing more. It also should be bootable in any way, even without any other bootable operating system - I mean situation when boot loader like GRUB is not available.\nIt is quite easy to prepare such partition with MS Windows installer: it is just to create NTFS partition, give it a bootable flag, and copy Windows DVD content into it - no voodoo with bootloader required. Is it possible to achieve such setup for Ubuntu as well?\nIf not, I would also be glad to have such partition bootable from GRUB. I also know that it is easy to boot Ubuntu installer from USB stick, but recovery partition has one big advantage: it cannot be lost.\n\nA: You always need some boot loader to boot.\nBIOS boots from MBR, UEFI boots from efi partition.\nBut you can create backup bootable flash drives with just grub to boot any system anywhere on system or flash drive.\nThis will boot an ISO from a hard drive or any second drive\nISO Booting with Grub 2 from Hard drive - drs305\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot\nExamples - you may copy & edit for your path & ISO version\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot/Examples\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1549847\nI do above for my hard drive and all my flash drives (which my system sees as another hard drive).

I recently updated the Ubuntu help page about this.\nNote that you should always keep a recovery DVD/USB handy, hard drive or grub corruption/failure will take your \"recovery partition\" with it.\nYou can also boot directly from an iso, which seems clever, but is easily broken if the file is moved/deleted, and also won't let you modify the partition it resides on.

After installing two 512 MB RAM chips (essentially increasing the RAM form .25 GB to 1.25), the system randomly shuts down or reboots. \nIs this due to a temperature problem? I tried installing lm-sensors, but the program couldn't detect any devices to monitor. How do I diagnose/fix this problem?\n\nA: Are you sure that the RAM modules are compatible with the motherboard of your computer? Have you stuck to the process for adding RAM modules described in the manual of your computer model?\nApart from what is told in the manual, you must unplug any AGP graphic card you have in the computer before adding the new modules. The reason is the connection between the graphic card and the RAM, it has some RAM MB \"reserved\". \nIf you have done all of the thing said, run memtest from Grub or download memtest86+ and run it from a CD at boot if you cannot find the Grub option.\n\nI have edited the answer to note these paragraphs of the manual I had found by searching Dell Dimension 8200 (Please, ensure it is the right one and read it carefully):\n\nNOTICE: If you remove your original memory modules from the computer\n  during a memory upgrade, keep them separate from any new modules that\n  you may have, even if the new modules were purchased from Dell. Your\n  original memory modules must be installed as a pair in either\n  connectors RIMM1 and RIMM 2 or RIMM 3 and RIMM4. Do not pair one\n  original memory module with one new memory module in connectors RIMM1\n  and RIMM2 or RIMM3 and RIMM4. Otherwise, your computer may not start\n  properly.\n[...]\nThe only two valid memory configurations are:\n  * A pair of matched memory modules installed in connectors RIMM1 and RIMM2 with continuity modules installed in connectors RIMM3 and RIMM4\n  or\n  * A pair of matched memory modules installed in connectors RIMM1 and RIMM2 and another matched pair installed in connectors RIMM3 and RIMM4\n\nI am not an expert, but the motherboard does not seem to allow to add RAM memory unless you ensure that you get matched RAM modules. They must be a pair RAM modules made to work together and originally sold together too.\nAnd if you are using only two RAM memory modules, you should plug the connectors modules into the right connectors before plugging the memory modules in:\n\nNOTICE: Be sure to install memory modules in the first two memory\n  connectors (RIMM1 and RIMM2) nearest the processor before installing\n  memory modules in the outer two memory connectors (RIMM3 and RIMM4).\n\nAnother option is to buy two pairs of matched RAM memory modules of the same capacity:\n\nNOTICE: If you upgrade the memory, the memory modules must be upgraded\n  in matched pairs of identical MB capacity in both memory connectors\n  RIMM1 and RIMM2 or memory connectors RIMM3 and RIMM4.\n\nAdding RAM modules to other motherboards with four connectors seems lees requiring. I think you can sometimes plug two RAM modules of the same capacity but bought separately into RIMM1 and RIMM3 or RIMM2 and RIMM4 and the computer works.\nPS: I am sorry for my rough English.\n", "Q: How do I fix a vboxdrv setup failure in VirtualBox? So, I tried creating an OS with VirtualBox, and I got this error:\nKernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)\n\nThe VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not loaded or there is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv. Please reinstall the kernel module by executing\n\n'/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup'\n\nas root. If it is available in your distribution, you should install the DKMS package first.

I am following this tutorial to correctly execute Aptana Studio on my Ubuntu 14.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command menu in aptana studio 3 is not working in ubuntu 14.04\nSo I have installed the Oracle JRE and finnally I have create this run.sh file that have to execute Aptana:\n!/bin/bash\n\nexport UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 /home/andrea/Programmi/Aptana_Studio_3/AptanaStudio3\n\nThe problem is that when I try to execute this script with my shell I obtain the following error message:\nandrea@andrea-virtual-machine:~/Programmi/Aptana_Studio_3$ sudo sh run.sh\nrun.sh: 1: run.sh: !/bin/bash: not found\nrun.sh: 3: export: /home/andrea/Programmi/Aptana_Studio_3/AptanaStudio3: bad variable name\n\nWhy? What am I missing? How can I fix this issue?\n\nA: Should be #!/bin/bash. I also think that you should have a newline at the end of export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 \n/home/andrea/Programmi/Aptana_Studio_3/AptanaStudio3\n\n\nA: There are two errors. In short, this is the particular fix I would suggest (details follow):\n#!/bin/sh\nUBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 /home/andrea/Programmi/Aptana_Studio_3/AptanaStudio3\n\nBad Hashbang Line\nAs Shutupsquare says, your hashbang line (technical details) should start with a #! rather than just !.\nThat is causing the first of your two error messages, and will prevent your script from being run as ./run.sh, but is not the reason your script is failing to run AptanaStudio3 (because the hashbang line is not required for sh run.sh calling syntax).\nBy the way, when you run sh run.sh, it runs your script with sh as the interpreter. But with the hashbang line #!/bin/bash, running ./run.sh would run your script with bash as  the interpreter. This script does not in any way depend on the advanced features of bash, and while bash's additional memory usage is almost certainly insignificant for this application, you may still wish to write the hashbang line so ./run.sh runs the script with sh:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nIncorrect Use of export\nThe main problem, which is causing your second error message and is the reason AptanaStudio3 fails to run, is that you're using export incorrectly. The export command does not run commands. So your command is being interpreted as an environment variable itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*export can set and export an environment variable:\nexport NAME=value\n\n\n*export can also export an environment variable (with whatever its current value is):\nexport NAME\n\nexport does not accept NAME=value command or NAME command syntax, however.\nAssuming your goal is to run the command /home/andrea/Programmi/Aptana_Studio_3/AptanaStudio3 with the UBUNTU_MENUPROXY variable defined and set to 0, you should just drop the word export altogether:\nUBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 /home/andrea/Programmi/Aptana_Studio_3/AptanaStudio3\n\nThat is the standard way to run a command with a modified environment, from a shell.\nThe purpose of export is to export variables into the environments of all subsequently launched child processes (i.e., every command run from your script). So running export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 on its own line followed by the AptanaStudio3 command, as Shutupsquare suggests, will work, and have the same effect, and is a perfectly good and acceptable way to do it.\nI prefer the way I've suggested above (without export) because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Semantically, your goal is not to export anything, but rather to run a single command with a modified environment. Using export may cause confusion to others reading your script (or to yourself later), and as a secondary consideration is arguably less elegant.\n\n*With export, you need two commands; using the way without it, you need only one.\n\n\nOptional reading: the env command works (sort of) the way you were trying to use export\nFinally, there is a command that accepts NAME=value command syntax. This command is env. There's no reason to use it in this shell script--its function, in that basic usage, is to provide (part of) the power of a shell in running a command with a modified environment, and you already have that power.\nHowever, under some circumstances, outside of shell scripting, you may find you need to set an environment variable for a command and run that command (and do those things in a single command). In contexts where just using the line VARIABLE=value command is not supported, you can use:\nenv VARIABLE=value command\n\nYou don't need that here though. All Bourne-style shells (e.g., sh, dash, bash, ksh, zsh) support VARIABLE=value command.\n", "Q: Is my GPU working correctly? Nvidia GeForce 525M.

The thumb drive is FAT32. I often transfer files from the thumb drive to an internal HDD (Ext4).\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes, the files are transferred at about 15MB/s.\n\n*Sometimes, the files are transferred at about 150MB/s.\n\n*Sometimes, I don't know what the transfer rate is but a 3GB file will take less than 10 sends to be transferred.\n\n\nIt seems to me that this speed difference is related to whether USB2 or USB3 protocol is being used at the time, although I don't know what the transfer rates are supposed to be for these protocols.\nIn any case, why would it vary? Is there any way that I can always achieve the higher rate?\n\nA: Some things that could be the reason:\nThe transfer rate depends a lot on the file count/file size - more so on a filesystem like FAT32.\nAre you sure the files were actually written completely when you measured the end time? I would guess the 3GB file was not yet finished writing, for example.\nPossibly some files where in the buffer cache in the fast case.\nDid you drop the cache before testing?\nYou can do it by echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n", "Q: how to expand partition in gparted I have 2 unallocated partitions in my dual boot laptop. I want to add these two unallocated partitions to \"/dev/sda5\" partition. I to do in GParted. \n\nA: To expand in GParted, the partition needs to be unmounted. So you cannot resize root (/) from GParted. You can try the resize2fs program from the command line (after using fdisk to recreate the partition to the larger size with the same starting cylinder). That only works if the free space comes after the partition. So, in your case, the only option is to reboot to a live USB, resize the partition using GParted like @ryekayo said. This will cause your filesystem's UUID to change, so you will have to change the UUID in your fstab, update GRUB, etc. (see this answer). It would be simpler to backup your home and reinstall.\n\nA: My suggestion is that:\nCreate a new partition.\nMove your /home to her. \nYou create the partition with ext4 from gparted. (/dev/sda?)\nYou open a terminal and run:\nsudo su \nmkdir /media/hometemp\nmount /dev/sda? /media/hometemp\ncd /home\ncp -ax . /media/hometemp\ncd /\nmv /home /home.old\nmkdir /home\numount /dev/sda?\nmount /dev/sda? /home\nblkid /dev/sda?  &&(The output will say: xxxxxxxxxxxxx)\nnano /etc/fstab\n&&Add these lines:\n---------------------\n#/dev/sda? was /home \nUUID=xxxxxx /home ext4    defaults        0       2\n---------------------\n&&Save file (Control+O)\n&&Close nano (Contro+X)\nrm /home.old\nreboot\n\n\nA: Here's what you need to do. \n\nNOTE: we're going to be moving /dev/sda5 around. This process will take a long time because your partition is pretty big. It can take like 3 hours or something. Be prepared. Also, backup everything! I'm not responsible if something goes wrong.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a LiveUSB/CD. This is done by creating a bootable USB/CD of Ubuntu, as if you're going to install Ubuntu, but you'll choose Try Ubuntu instead of installing it.\n\n\n*\n\n*This runs Ubuntu off the USB/CD, think of it as \"running Ubuntu in RAM\". This will allow us to partition your hard disk. You have to do this because you're going to resize the main partition of your installed Ubuntu (called the \"root partition\", denoted by /).\n\n\n*Open Gparted. If it's not installed, install it using sudo apt-get install gparted.\n\n*Right click on /dev/sda5 and click Resize/Move. Drag the left arrow to the left to take over that empty space (grey area). If that doesn't work, then you'll have to first drag the box to the left, then drag the right arrow to the far right. If that doesn't work, then I think you'll have to do it in two steps. 1) Drag box to right. Click OK. 2) Drag arrow to right.\nTake a look at the GParted window now. You'll see that /dev/sda5 has been resized.  We're not going to do anything with the other unallocated space of size 1MB because moving it around will make the process longer, and it's useless for 1 megabytes =/.\nOnce you're satisfied, click Apply to apply the changes we did and start the resizing. This is the part that will probably take a long time. Make sure your laptop is plugged in to a power source.\n\n*Run Boot Repair. This will fix boot issues because we moved /dev/sda5. You can install Boot Repair using the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\nClick on \"Recommended Repair\" when it opens.\nReboot your machine. Remove the USB/CD. You should now have a resized /dev/sda5.\n", "Q: How to create Maildir on user creation? How do I make the adduser script create the appropriate Maildir directory of the new user?\n\nI have an Ubuntu server running postfix. When I first installed it was deliverying emails to /var/mail/<user>/.\nI've changed to use /home/<user>/Maildir by putting home_mailbox = Maildir/ on /etc/postfix/main.cf.\nAt first I didn't worked because there wasn't a Maildir directory for my user (email was delivered back on my provider with the error).\nThen I created the Maildir directory, with the subdirectories new, cur and tmp as Maildir uses. Worked fine after that.\nBut this way I would have to manually create those directories everytime I add an user. Is there anyway to make the adduser script (that is what I use) to create those for me?\n\nA: According to this manpage on adduser, it will copy anything present in /etc/skel (or another skeleton directory, if specified) to the newly created home directory. The Ubuntu manpage only mentions files, but I think the functionality might hold for directories as well. So I suggest that you create a Maildir directory in /etc/skel, along with cur, new and tmp subdirectories. According to the answer to When I create a new user, how do I automatically create a .virtualenvs directory in their home directory?, it works for directories as well.\n", "Q: Abnormally High Fan Speed on Cool Laptop, Dell Inspiron 15R 5520, Ubuntu 14.04, I am using a Dell Inspiron 15R 5520 running Ubuntu 14.04 alongside Windows 8.1. My issue is with the Dell's fan, which is running at full speed during most of the time the computer is booted into Ubuntu. Any small task I do, from searching for an app, to loading webpages and switching tabs in a browser, causes the fan speed to reach its max speed. Oddly, the fan only does this when the computer is booted into Ubuntu, but not Windows 8.1. I tried flashing my BIOS and updating my chip set, to no avail. \nSystem manager shows 4 cpu cores each running at above 10% when the fan goes to its highest speed. And it will remain at this speed for several minutes thereafter. I noticed that the utilization percentages for each core does not match the cpu load average. For example, it said that the average was 0.43 at some point, but when I checked the core percentages while the fan was running high they are all lower, as if the Monitor is adding the percentages together and using this to determine fan speed (just my hypothesis). But there is still some correlation between fan speed and cpu usage.\nThe Dell is not hot when the fan is running high; the air it blows is either cool or slightly warm. I recently cleaned the computer's exhaust, too. \nLastly, I am a beginner at Linux, so please, if you can, don't be too technical with responses. And just to mention, I learned about Jupiter, which I found out is discontinued, and I tried using i8kutils while following a thread from a forum when researching a solution and my fan was barely on after that (had to re-install Ubuntu).\nCan anyone offer a solution to this issue? \nThanks in advance, \nJordan\n\nA: I recently figured out how to fix the fan issues in Ubuntu 14.04 on my Dell laptop. I found out about a program called TLP, which is a power management tool that automatically adjusts my cpu frequency and the power usage of other hardware. The site for TLP is here but you can search for and find it in the Software Center. Anyway, once it installed, it immediately fixed the fan issue. Now my fans run quietly, only speeding up when necessary. I restarted my computer several times to verify if it worked, and indeed, my fans were working like normal. \nTo everyone who posted, I thank you for your replies and efforts to help me out.\nUPDATE\nTLP did not remedy the matter; it helped slightly, but the fans still overspeed. I found a working solution and posted it as an answer to another thread of mine, here: Persistent High-Fan Speed Ubuntu 14.04. Thanks again for your assistance in this matter.\n-Jordan\n", "Q: Trash bin empty automatic My trash bin empties automatic and I lost some valuable files and I don't remember I ever changed something in the settings, how can I fix this?\n\nA: \nnautilus->edit->preferences.\nUnchek the last option \"include a delete command that bypasses the trash\"\n", "Q: When I reach the installation it says : \"This computer currently has no detected operating systems.\".

What I can do is follow instructions, however something always went wrong at some point and I can't improvise. The answers I have read said stuff about backing up things, and partitions and stuff, and I couldn't understand even half of the instructions in the answers.\nIt would mean a lot to me if someone took the time to explain to me what I need to do in a very detailed manner with lots of images so I know what I'm looking for, because I am lost here (sorry for the long text, but I tried to \"trace my steps\" for you because maybe I did something wrong but I didn't know that I shouldn't have done it).\n\nA: I see that you have somehow managed to enable \"Legacy Boot\" in UEFI, since you probably got here:  \nSo, what I'd like you to do, is disable it and go back to the previous state. If you UEFI boot with a 64-bit Ubuntu image (DVD), you ought to see a GRUB menu like in this question (the OEM option won't be present, but Try Ubuntu and Install Ubuntu will be.):  \nTo get a 64-bit image, download the AMD64 (or AMD64 + Mac) ISO from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/release/.

This is for a very specific use, i.e. the delivery of DCP to digital cinema servers.\nI'd like to be able to do that in Ubuntu.\nThe challenge is that I am a total Ubuntu newbie (usually a Mac OSX user) so I'm looking for a simple solution, involving as little coding as possible (at the moment, I wouldn't even know where to enter a command line...)\nSo far, I have downloaded Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.1, burned it to DVD, and successfully booted my Mac Pro in Ubuntu...

The default inode size is 256 bytes.\nThe command to create filesystems, mke2fs, has an option to specify the inode size.\nUse something like this to create a filesystem:  \nmke2fs -t ext3 -I 128 /dev/sdXX\nFrom man mke2fs:\n    -I inode-size\n           Specify  the size of each inode in bytes.

So I tried a third time, again using \"something else\" but I noticed something wierd, It appeared that i had been installing the boot loader on the wrong partition.

Could it read and write its contents? I am thinking of switching to Ubuntu, but I am concerned about some things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Ubuntu supports the usage (read/write) of previous data (from Windows formatted NTFS drives) or do I have to completely format my HDD  to ext3 file system to fully use Ubuntu?\n\n*Can Ubuntu read and write the file format of Windows based programs, e.g Office documents with doc, ppt, xls format?\n\n*Can Ubuntu install Windows based programs, like Photoshop and FL Studio?\n\n*What gaming options does Ubuntu provide?\n\n\nA: Ubuntu is capable of reading and writing files stored on Windows formatted partitions. These partitions are normally formatted with NTFS, but are sometimes formatted with FAT32. You will also see FAT16 on other devices.\nGeneral Considerations\nUbuntu will show files and folders in NTFS/FAT32 filesystems which are hidden in Windows. Consequently, important hidden system files in the Windows C:\\ partition will show up if this is mounted. Since it is all-too-easy to accidentally modify or delete files which are essential for Windows, it is advisable to mount your Windows C:\\ partition as seldom as possible, preferably not at all, or read-only by configuring /etc/fstab (see below). If you have data which you want to access regularly from both Windows and Ubuntu, it is better to create a separate data partition for this, formatted NTFS.\nWhether you write to your Windows C:\\ partition or a shared NTFS data partition, be aware that if you are using Windows 7, and Windows 7 is in a hibernated state when you write to the NTFS partition from Ubuntu, you will lose all your changes. This is because when Windows 7 is hibernated it writes the system state to a file stored on disk and restores from that file when the system is re-awakened, thus restoring the whole fileystem to a state before any changes made from Ubuntu. In Windows 7 you must avoid using hibernation. With Windows 8, the situation is more complex in that, by default, it uses a hybrid hibernation/shutdown when you shut the system down. Any changes made by Ubuntu will be lost when you reboot into Ubuntu.\nWith both Windows 7 and Windows 8 (when installed to a legacy mbr partition table) there is usually a 100-200MB boot partition labelled \"SYSTEM\". Do not mount it - you do not need to. Similarly it is highly advisable to leave any recovery partitions unmounted. \n\nA: Ubuntu can read/write ntfs drives\nFrom my experience Libre Office (Ubuntu's clone of Microsoft office) doesn't deal very well with layouts from MS Word, but for the basic xls or doc focuments it should be fine. But there must be plenty of other MS Office like software you could try.\nFor windows programs it is basically not possible, but there is a software called WINE which can install those windows programs for you and make them run on Ubuntu, even videogames but not all of them are compatible, check the database to see if your applications would be compatible \nConclusion: You don't need to sacrifice Windows to move to Ubuntu. Both can live quite well together on the same computer. So there is nothing to lose trying Ubuntu.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu supports read & write to NTFS without any problem. \nYou can read all the Microsoft Office docs in Ubuntu using Libreoffice or Openoffice etc. You can have some issues with text format because of default fonts etc.(which you can fix easily) but you will have all the data.\nAlso you can't use photoshop in ubuntu but their is a good alternative viz. GIMP. \nIf you really need to use photoshop you can use wine (however it doesn't runs very smoothly) or you can have windows installed as a Virtual Machine (using Virtual Box or Vmware) and use it (this is how I use). Same goes for ft studio.\nTo play Games you can use wine. I used to play dota, Age of Empire, Counterstrike etc. without any issue.\nI had similar questions in mind so I kept Ubuntu & Windows both for long time. But I am using Ubuntu only from past 4 years & I loved it, I never missed windows :). Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu goes black after kali tools installation reboot Whenever I try to install Kali Tools on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line? \n\nA: A visual representation.\nTerminal\nSomething you can sit down at, and work like a boss. \n\nConsole\nSome hardware that does a bunch of stuff.\n\nAnother example of a console, would be a video game console such as a Super Nintendo [where you can play Actraiser]\nShell\nBasically an application for running commands.\n\nCommand Line [Interface]\nBasically anything you input commands into.\n\n\nA: I think that back in the early days of time-sharing computers, every user had a terminal (when they could get one!), but only the system operators had a console. The console could be used for tasks like rebooting the machine or getting system diagnostics that weren't possible from user terminals. The console was in the machine room, an intrinsic part of the computer, whereas the terminals could be remote. The console would also include hardware lights and switches, not just text input and output.\nI would say that the command line is an area where a user can type a command, whereas the shell is the program that interprets/obeys that command. The term \"shell\" is very particular to Unix derivatives; \"command-line\" is more in the Windows/DOS tradition. The equivalent on mainframes is usually called a \"job control language\".\nClearly, these original distinctions have become blurred over time as technology changes.\n\nA: This is a vague topic, because the terms are very ambiguous. I strongly recommend reading the links I've provided throughout this answer, which are also my sources for this answer.\nA shell is the layer above the kernel: \n\n\n*\n\n*It interprets the commands entered by the user, and processes them. The shell has access to the kernel, unlike users. Users can only access the kernel through entering commands using a shell, and by using processes (i.e. running programs). Programs use system calls to access kernel functionality. All system calls together form the system API.\n\n*Examples of shells are given in the second terminal definition.\n\n\nA terminal has many meanings:\n\n\n*\n\n*(1) A text terminal. This is the combination of a display monitor and a keyboard. A cable connected the terminal to the computer (often indirectly). It was called a terminal since it was located at the terminal end of this cable. These terminals were usually physically separated from the computer, because back in the days many terminals were connected to a single mainframe/computer, so multiple users could have access to the computer at the same time. \n\n*(2) A terminal window a.k.a. terminal emulator. In Linux, a terminal window is the emulation of a console, contained in a GUI window. It is the CLI you type your text in, and this input is read by the shell you're using. There are many types of shells (e.g. bash, dash, ksh88) and terminals (e.g. konsole, gnome). \n\n*(3) For an explanation on pseudo terminals, view this. It's a pair of two 'device files' used for communication between a process and a terminal emulator.\n\n\nA console has many meanings: \n\n\n*\n\n*(1) an instrument panel containing the controls for a computer.\n\n*(2) A System console a.k.a. computer console. This is the combination of the display monitor and a keyboard connected to a computer. This is synonymous with what we call a 'text terminal'. Sometimes also other user-input peripherals such as a mouse is part of a console. \n\n*(3) A command-line interface that covers the full screen. This is in contrast with a terminal window, which is a GUI with an X at the right top corner to close it. These are the two display modes for CLI (command-line interfaces) in Unix-like systems. Similarly to a terminal window, the console can run many shells as well.\n\n\nOften, operating systems allow you to run multiple consoles on a physical console (console definition 2). These are called virtual consoles a.k.a. virtual terminals, and can be accessed through ctrl + alt + Fx combinations. For example, if you want to open the 3rd virtual console, you use the combination ctrl + alt + F3.\nConsoles (definition 3) might appear to you as an anachronism, but experts should be comfortable using them, since there are many OSes that do not support GUI's. Also, if a GUI stops responding, the console may still work.\n\nA: Trying user-centric short answer:\ncommand line - the line where you enter commands. Usually it used to tell that you need to run something in text mode window (command line interface) provided by your operating system.\nshell - the actual program run by operating system to process stuff you enter into command line. Hence the name - user-friendly shell for non-friendly OS core. It provides command prompt, such as $ or >, runs its own commands and apps. You always work through the shell program and never operate with console or terminal directly.\nconsole - is a window where your text mode programs are running. This window processes key presses, knows it is width and height. Can be fullscreen.\nterminal - is some device with display for humans that accepts input stream of characters and shows them. There is no feedback to user about height or width (only hacks) or keyboard keypresses - only chars are travelling to it. Terminal processes special sequences in this stream to make things colored, clean up the screen and do other nasty things. Terminals are flaky, because it is easy to mess things if the file you are piping to output contains that special sequences. They are popular in networking and device debug interfaces, because you just need a single stream for sending output and control the output device and you can just tap into conversation without the need to initialize or create a window.\nserial console - is a console that processes input stream like a terminal.\n\nA: From the Linux Information Project:\n\nTerminal : Technically , A terminal window, also referred to as a terminal emulator, is a text-only window in a graphical user interface (GUI) that emulates a console.\n\nIn Our words A GUI Application , from where we can access an user's console.\n\nConsole: an instrument panel containing the controls for a computer\nShell :A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems\nCommand-Line : A command line is the space to the right of the command prompt on an all-text display mode on a computer monitor (usually a CRT or LCD panel) in which a user enters commands and data\n\n\nA: Short answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*terminal = text input/output environment\n\n*console = physical terminal\n\n*shell = command line interpreter\n\n\n\nLong answer:\nConsole and terminal are closely related. Originally, they meant a piece of equipment through which you could interact with a computer: in the early days of unix, that meant a teleprinter-style device resembling a typewriter, sometimes called a teletypewriter, or “tty” in shorthand. The name “terminal” came from the electronic point of view, and the name “console” from the furniture point of view. Very early in unix history, electronic keyboards and displays became the norm for terminals.\nTerminal\nIn unix terminology, a terminal is a particular kind of device file which implements a number of additional commands (ioctls) beyond read and write. Some terminals are provided by the kernel on behalf of a hardware device, for example with the input coming from the keyboard and the output going to a text mode screen, or with the input and output transmitted over a serial line. Other terminals, sometimes called pseudo-terminals or pseudo-ttys, are provided (through a thin kernel layer) by programs called terminal emulators. Some types of terminal emulators include:\n\n\n*\n\n*GUI applications running in the X Window System: Xterm, Gnome Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, etc.\n\n*Screen and tmux, which provides a layer of isolation between a program and another terminal\n\n*Ssh, which connects a terminal on one machine with programs on another machine\n\n*Expect, for scripting terminal interactions\n\n\nThe word terminal can also have a more traditional meaning of a device through which one interacts with a computer, typically with a keyboard and display. For example an X terminal is a kind of thin client, a special-purpose computer whose only purpose is to drive a keyboard, display, mouse and occasionally other human interaction peripherals, with the actual applications running on another, more powerful computer.\nConsole\nA console is generally a terminal in the physical sense that is by some definition the primary terminal directly connected to a machine. The console appears to the operating system as a (kernel-implemented) terminals. On some systems, such as Linux and FreeBSD, the console appears as several terminals (ttys) (special key combinations switch between these terminals); just to confuse matters, the name given to each particular terminal can be “console”, ”virtual console”, ”virtual terminal”, and other variations.\nSee also Why is a Virtual Terminal “virtual”, and what/why/where is the “real” Terminal?.\nCommand line [interface]\nA command line is an interface where the user types a command (which is expressed as a sequence of characters — typically a command name followed by some parameters) and presses the Return key to execute that command.\nShell\nA shell is the primary interface that users see when they log in, whose primary purpose is to start other programs. (I don't know whether the original metaphor is that the shell is the home environment for the user, or that the shell is what other programs are running in.)\nIn unix circles, shell has specialized to mean a command-line shell, centered around entering the name of the application one wants to start, followed by the names of files or other objects that the application should act on, and pressing the Enter key. Other types of environments (with the notable recent exception of Gnome Shell) usually don't use the word “shell”; for example, window systems involve “window managers” and “desktop environments”, not a “shell”.\nThere are many different unix shells. Ubuntu's default shell is Bash (like most other Linux distributions). Popular alternatives include zsh (which emphasizes power and customizability) and fish (which emphasizes simplicity).\nCommand-line shells include flow control constructs to combine commands. In addition to typing commands at an interactive prompt, users can write scripts. The most common shells have a common syntax based on the Bourne_shell. When discussing “shell programming”, the shell is almost always implied to be a Bourne-style shell. Some shells that are often used for scripting but lack advanced interactive features include the Korn shell (ksh) and many ash variants. Pretty much any Unix-like system has a Bourne-style shell installed as /bin/sh, usually ash, ksh or bash. On Ubuntu, /bin/sh is Dash, an ash variant (chosen because it is faster and uses less memory than bash).\nIn unix system administration, a user's shell is the program that is invoked when they log in. Normal user accounts have a command-line shell, but users with restricted access may have a restricted shell or some other specific command (e.g. for file-transfer-only accounts).\n\nThe division of labor between the terminal and the shell is not completely obvious. Here are their main tasks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Input: the terminal converts keys into control sequences (e.g. Left → \\e[D). The shell converts control sequences into commands (e.g. \\e[D → backward-char).\n\n*Line edition, input history and completion are provided by the shell.\n\n\n*\n\n*The terminal may provide its own line edition, history and completion instead, and only send a line to the shell when it's ready to be executed. The only common terminal that operates in this way is M-x shell in Emacs.\n\n\n*Output: the shell emits instructions such as “display foo”, “switch the foreground color to green”, “move the cursor to the next line”, etc. The terminal acts on these instructions.\n\n*The prompt is purely a shell concept.\n\n*The shell never sees the output of the commands it runs (unless redirected). Output history (scrollback) is purely a terminal concept.\n\n*Inter-application copy-paste is provided by the terminal (usually with the mouse or key sequences such as Ctrl+Shift+V or Shift+Insert). The shell may have its own internal copy-paste mechanism as well (e.g. Meta+W and Ctrl+Y).\n\n*Job control (launching programs in the background and managing them) is mostly performed by the shell. However, it's the terminal that handles key combinations like Ctrl+C to kill the foreground job and Ctrl+Z to suspend it.\n\n\n\n Recycled from Unix & Linux \n\nA: The Shell is a program which processes commands and returns output, like Bash in Linux.\nA Terminal is a program that runs a Shell. In the past it was a physical device (before terminals were monitors with keyboards, they were teletypes) and then its concept was transferred into software, like GNOME Terminal.\nSo when I open GNOME Terminal, a black window that runs a Shell appears so I can run my commands.\nA Console is a special sort of terminal. It was also a physical device. For example in Linux we have virtual consoles, which we can access by a combination of Ctrl+Alt+F1 to F7.\nConsole sometimes means the keyboard and monitor physically attached to this computer.\n\nA: The answers here seem very good. However they are too dry and technical for my taste so I'll give a take.\nTerminal is the end of something - where it terminates. For example if you take the subway in some city, the station where you get down is your terminal. Or in an airport the place where people come out when they reach their destination country is considered the terminal. The reason the terminal in the airport is nowadays both the place you get people onboard and the place you get them off the plane is for obvious economic reasons.\nA computer's purpose is to get data, do something with it, and spit out the result. Thus the terminal is any device from where you can get the result of the computation (a screen for example). It just happened that in the first computers you usually had the input (keyboard) and output (screen) as a single device. Because of that, nowadays terminals are considered any input/output devices. A mouse, keyboard, screen, camera, they are all terminals.\nShell is an OS thing. On a computer you have the kernel which on Ubuntu for example is the Linux part. Now since the kernel is really low-level a shell is provided - a program that let's the user interact with the kernel in an easy way. That's what BASH is for example.\nConsole is (from a dictionary) \n\na flat surface that contains the controls for a machine, for a piece\n  of electrical equipment, etc.\n\nThat's why in music industry the board with all the knobs, or in a space shuttle the command table, they are all considered consoles. Super Nintendo and PS2 are also called consoles historically since the first such entertainment devices looked like boxes with a bunch of buttons on them.\nCommand line is just an interface - the opposite of GUI. Namely there are two types of interfaces on a computer; CLI (command line interface) and GUI (graphical user interface). The main difference is that the first one gets input from the keyboard while the second gets input from the mouse.\n\nA: Most terminals nowadays are strictly speaking terminal emulators.\nIt is a type of role in the workings of a UNIX-like system and at the same time the basic interface offered by the systems. In fact everything, including the GUI builds on top of it.\nColloquially \"terminal\" may also refer to end-points in a computer network with a star-topography.\nConsole refers to the (hardware) interfaces for the terminals. I.e. there are serial consoles and nowadays mostly virtual ones.\nThe window colloquially referred to as \"console\"-window is a shell, connected to a terminal of the system, via a virtual console.\nBack in the day when computers were expensive a facility might have had one actual computer and several terminals connecting to it, via serial cables (\"serial console\"). The OS, operations, etc. were carried out on the physical Computer, input and output happened on the console(s).\nYou can switch between virtual terminals by pressing CTRL+ALT+F1(through to F6): a leftover of those times.\nToday the concept of \"thin clients\" goes back in this direction of centralizing massive amounts of resources and providing just enough hardware to provide a state of the art interface at the actual workplace.  \nshell is the \"engine\" that you see in the terminal. It provides interop with the system itself and adds nice features like auto-complete, variables etc..\nIt translates back and forth between the actual OS / kernel which uses system calls and you. System calls w/o shell are a bit like coding assembler and a shell at least gives you C.\ncommand line refers to the method of exchanging input and output via a text-window. Strictly speaking the line in which you type is the (current) command line. The method in general is more correctly referred to as command line interface or CLI.  \n\n\n*\n\n*kernel\n\n*offers terminal\n\n*terminal is connected via a console\n\n*console runs shell\n\n*commands and output are exchanged via command line (interface)\n\n\nA: These terms often go together, so people use one of the terms to refer to the collection. (i.e. it's usually obvious from context that they mean a terminal window providing an interface to a command line shell).\nTo keep this from getting to long-winded, I'm just going to say xterm as a stand-in for XTerm / Gnome Terminal / Konsole / mrxvt / etc / etc.  Same for bash.\nConsole has multiple other specific meanings, so leave that out for now.\nTerminal: Something that provides human interaction with programs through a bidirectional stream of ASCII / UTF8 / other characters, usually with VT100 or similar escape code processing.  (E.g. backspace, delete, arrow keys, etc. generate escape codes.  Programs can print escape codes to move the cursor around the terminal screen, switch to bold text, and/or color, clear or scroll the screen, etc.)  In the old days, this was often a dedicated appliance with a screen and keyboard and a serial port.  Now, it's usually a program like xterm.\nThere are device files for programs to read/write from/to terminals, and virtual terminals also have the other side accessible as a device file.  This is where xterm writes your input so bash can read it.\nEvery terminal, including virtual ones, provides basic line editing when it's in cooked (as opposed to raw) mode.  This is handled by kernel code.  It's bash that provides the line editing that you can do with the arrow keys.  (Try running cat and typing if you want to see what the basic kernel-provided line editing is like.  Backspace works, and a couple other things as per your stty settings.)\nEven though there is a lot of kernel code behind the terminal devices, it would be refered to as terminal-handling code, not as a terminal itself.\nEdit: Gilles has convinced me that referring to a tty as a terminal is proper usage.  Terminal Emulators, and interactive programs that run connected to a terminal, are all dependent on the terminal semantics implemented by the kernel.  (Most of this behaviour is standardised by POSIX, and is the same across Linux/*BSD/other Unix.)  A full-screen text editor depends on the behaviour of Unix tty stuff as well as the cursor-movement escape-code handling, and many other features, of the terminal emulator.\nHowever, a physical VT100 with a screen, keyboard, and serial port is an instance of a terminal.  It doesn't require a Unix kernel on the other end of its serial port to be complete.  Something completely different could be sending it escape codes and ASCII text, and receiving the same from it.  It would just be a VT100, though, not a Unix terminal.  A terminal emulator plus the Unix tty semantics make up the full package of a Unix terminal that a program like bash normally runs on.\nCommand line is a style of user interface, where you type something, then press return to make something happen.  It's also used as a shorthand for a command-line shell, like bash or MS-DOS, but you can also say “it's a command line tool” about something like fdisk.  Considering only programs that use a terminal for their UI, the two main families are command line and full-screen text (e.g. an editor like vi or emacs -nw).\nCommand line programs that normally run on terminals almost always still work with their input and output redirected to files, but terminal-based full-screen programs like editors or email clients are interactive-only, and wouldn't work.\nA shell is a program for starting other programs.  In a Unix context, it's common to mean command-line shell (i.e. Bourne shell or C shell equivalent).  Unix shells can also read their input from files, i.e. shell scripts.  They are full programming languages, with variables, loops, and conditionals, and many programs are written in bash (or with only the /bin/sh POSIX shell features, for more portability).  It's also easily possible to write a quick  for i in *.something; do some_program \"$i\";done  in an interactive shell.\nPutting it all together, a shell like bash (or whatever program you started by running a shell command) will receive characters from the /dev/pts/N terminal device after xterm writes your input into its side of the pseudo-terminal.  If you run cat, then hit ^c, the kernel tty code will act on the ^c and send a SIGINT to the foreground process on that terminal.  (Note the usage of terminal in this context to mean the Unix tty, not a terminal emulator or something hooked up to a serial port.)  This happens because the shell puts the terminal into \"cooked\" mode before starting any program, which means the kernel acts on some control-sequences.  (The tty code still has nothing to do with handling VT100 escape codes, just a few low-ASCII control codes.)  If instead of an xterm, you are using the Linux console text terminal, then the kernel IS doing the VT100 emulation, and handling all that stuff.  Linux can be compiled without virtual console text terminal support, but not without tty support.\nConsole is sometimes used as a synonym for terminal (KDE even has a terminal emulator called Konsole).\nAs 0xSheepdog points out, it also has another meaning: locally attached human-interaction hardware.\nIn a kernel context, console has another specific meaning: it's the terminal where boot messages are written.  This can be a serial port.  Normally, of course, it's the text console implemented by the kernel on top of the drivers for graphics hardware and USB/ps2/AT keyboards.  If you boot Linux with console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 on the command line, you'll get kernel messages on your screen AND on the serial port.\nLinux implements virtual consoles (/dev/tty1 to N).  You can swap which one your physical screen/keyboard are controlling with Ctrl+Alt+FN.  Typical Linux distros create 6, and start getty on all of them, so even if you can't or don't want to start X11, you can log in 6 times and flip between a command, a man page, and whatever else, without running a program like screen.  Linux (the kernel) includes a VT100-style terminal emulator to provide a terminal interface through your screen and keyboard on the virtual consoles.\nThe standard 6 virtual terminals with login prompts is why Ctrl+Alt+F7 gets you back to your X11 session: the X server grabs the next available virtual console.  (The X server opens /dev/input/... directly, rather than getting your keypresses from /dev/tty7, though.)\nSo \"swap to a text console\" means to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and use that terminal.  Back when computers were slow and didn't have much RAM, some people spent much of their time on the text consoles, since they were fast, you could set a nice font, and even change the terminal size to have smaller characters, but have more on screen at once.  Alt+Left and Alt+Right swap to prev/next console.  (X11 disables this for its console, of course, leaving only the Ctrl+Alt+FN combo.)\nSo console is the only one of these terms that doesn't have a single well-defined technical meaning.  It has a couple different ones.  (Depending on how you feel about terminal proper vs. terminal plus tty handling, you could say that terminal also has multiple meanings.)\n", "Q: problem in accessing NTFS drive: \"The disk contains an unclean file system\" When i try to access the drive , following problem occurs-\nError mounting /dev/sda2 at /media/ankur/D0484A98484A7CEA: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda2\" \"/media/ankur/D0484A98484A7CEA\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda2': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

Forever.\n\n*Usually Linux users prefer software-based disk encryption and software-based RAID, because non-standardized or proprietary technology proved to be unreliable in terms of data security and data recovery. If you intend to use free software solutions like Linux for data security or redundancy, also plan in the required computing resources. \n\n*There have been reports of successful attacks like Warm Replug Attacks on some devices or setups.\n\n\nEdit: Michael Larabel posted articles on Phoronix where he speculates that SED/OPAL support may be coming to Linux soon, just in case anyone stumbles over this post from the past looking for more up to date information.\n\nA: There are different kinds of hardware encryption on SSDs, see SSDs with usable built-in hardware-based full disk encryption for an in-depth explanation. \nYou asked about the Samsung 840 EVO in particular. It is always encrypting your data and is unlocked by the ATA HDD password set in the BIOS, which defaults to blank. Later you can move the SSD to a new machine and enter the the ATA HDD password via the BIOS there to unlock it. Nothing involved in unlocking is stored outside of the drive itself.\nAs a Linux user, I prefer this solution over software-based drive encryption.

These hard drives have partitions with old OS's which have a lot of key data that I use often.\nThe problem is, I have 2 partitions with the same name, \"Main Drive\" and \"Main Drive\". Ubuntu, to differentiate between them, renames one drive to \"Main Drive1\", while keeping the other just \"Main Drive\".\nThe problem is, every time I restart Ubuntu, it chooses randomly which partition to rename. As a result, any bookmarks or directories that I have in those partitions, do not work, and have to be reconfigured every time I reboot.\nAre there any solutions to this problem?\n\nA: LittleByBlue is correct that that is the easiest method. I myself would rename both to \"Main Drive 1\" and \"Main Drive 2\".\n\nThe problem is, every time I restart Ubuntu, it chooses randomly which partition to rename. \n\nThat is normal for USB mounting. We use UUIDs to fix this problem. See the wiki UsingUUID about this (these UUIDs are edited into  /etc/fstab and you can get UUIDs per partition with sudo blkid)\n\nYou can also mount one of them in another location. Those disks probably all mount in /media and we also have /mnt as mountpoint (see Why have both /mnt and /media? for the difference). Mounting is done in /etc/fstab.\n\nA: If you can live without one of them being displayed in \"Devices\" section, just mount it somewhere in /etc/fstab\nThe name that you see is written inside file system and can't be altered by udev rules. But you can make one of the disks mount totally unreadable on boot, and make it readable after the GUI booted. Mount options or udev rules can help in this.\nYou can although use udev to run a renaming script every time disk is mounted and unmounted, but I'd recommend against it - it just feels bug-prone.\nAnyway, study udev rules.\n", "Q: Nvidia Optimus dual screen setup on TP W520 Hi I'm trying to setup Nvidia Optimus with Driver 331 from xorg-edgers with an external Monitor on Displayport. \nTP Display resolution: 1920x1080\nExt.

Thanks!\n\nA: The installer is warning you that you have not created or configured a swap partition. On low memory systems, having a swap partition can increase performance by making more physical memory available, because the system can write out allocated but unused memory pages to disk.\nIf you have a large amount of physical memory (>8GB) then you probably do not need a swap space for a desktop system. If you have low memory (<2GB) then you might want to enable swap.\nIf you do decide to enable swap, you will need to create an extra partition of the appropriate size, and in the \"Use as\" drop down select \"Swap\".\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Swap FAQ\n\n*Why is swap being used even though I have plenty of free RAM?\n\n*I have 16GB RAM.

At my first attempt I tried to deploy services to my hosts using --to key for juju deploy. \nI realized something is going wrong when Juju failed to create relation between Keystone and MySQL deployed on the same host.\nTo deploy services I used the following syntax:\njuju deploy keystone --to 1   \njuju deploy mysql --to 1\n\n Some googling gave me this question on askubuntu and this guide.\n So, as I understand, the correct way to deploy services in manual environment is using lxc containers for services being deployed to the same host (if these services can work in containers, of course).\nAlthough I see such advantages of lxc like service independency and isolation, I still don't understand why services deployed by Juju MUST be isolated in containers. Is it a Juju design flaw or temporary solution? \nIs there any way to deploy a couple of services to the same host without lxc?\nI think it can be done by specifying config file for each service being deployed, but this would eliminate nearly all Juju \"magic\" and simplicity...\n\nA: Juju itself doesn't care. It is up to the charms that you deploy to handle the situation, or not. So this isn't really treated as a problem at all; it's merely a difference between what Juju supports, what charms typically support, and accepted best practice.\nI don't think this answer is specific to the manual provider. It applies to all providers.\nMost charms assume that they \"own\" the machine (or container) that they are deployed to, and in the past this was the only way to deploy them.\nThis isolation makes charms easier to develop and test. It eliminates the need for charm developers to worry about sharing resources with other charms. A modular deployment makes it easier to manage complexity. By limiting interactions between charms to Juju relations, they can remain clean and well understood. Charm authors do not have to worry about making \"system\"-level changes that might adversely impact other charms; it is up to the containerization to handle this correctly. This eliminates a whole class of charm bugs where one charm adversely affects another.\nSo, in practice, charms should be deployed to their own containers at a minimum, unless they are specifically designed to work together. Conflicts that arise when two charms are deployed to the same machine without putting them in containers will generally not be treated as bugs.\nThis shouldn't affect much. LXC is lightweight.\nNone of this stops you writing your own charms, or modifying existing charms, to permit them to be deployed to the same machine or container. Juju will permit it, but it is then up to the charms to ensure that they don't conflict.\n\nIs it a Juju design flaw or temporary solution?\n\nNo - it's not really a Juju thing at all; it's the chosen best practice amongst charm authors, and relates to decisions made about what deployment configurations charms should and should not support.\nThere are some edge cases where it is useful, and not difficult to support (eg. the Juju GUI running on the bootstrap node), so Juju permits it. I believe that there are no plans for Juju's support to change.\n", "Q: How to install Windows 7 on the same partition as Ubuntu 12.04 ie. dual boot? I have a Dell Vostro 3000 Series with Ubuntu 12.04 pre-installed.\nI want to keep the Ubuntu and install Windows 7 Ultimate along with it.\nThe partition on which Ubuntu is installed is the only one with unused space and every time I try to Install Windows 7, it says \"Windows cannot be installed on this Drive.\" and leaves me with the only option of deleting the partition, but I want to keep Ubuntu as well.\n\nA: You should shrink the partition from within Ubuntu (use GParted, or something similar). You then can use the unformatted space to create a NTFS partition using Windows. \nNote that Windows annoyingly overwrites the boot-sector and insists on using the Windows bootloader, so you need to reinstall GRUB afterwards; see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\n\nA: To install Window$ on drive with data you need: \nFor EFI boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPT partition table.\n\n*EFI partition formatted as FAT16, preferably in the beginning of the drive. \n\n*Empty space for window$ itself. \n\n\nFor non-EFI boot: \n\n\n*\n\n*MBR partition table\n\n*Empty space for window$ bootloader in the beginning of the drive. - 150Mb suffice.\n\n*Empty space for Window$ itself.\n\n\nIn both cases \"empty space: means not the empty partition, and not the empty space of logical partition, but only a totally empty space. \n", "Q: Update 12.04 LTS to 14.04 on dual boot laptop with win7 already installed Have 12.04 LTS on laptop with win7 as a dual boot install.\nWant to upgrade it to latest LTS version 14.04.\nSo what is the best process, upgrade or do a clean install?\nUpgrade will be long path but should not affect current app;ications, thunderbird libre office\nclean install will require thunderbird to be configured for all mail boxes.\nif clean instal how does one handle the partitions?\nwill 1404 install recognise existing 12.04/win7 partitions or will I have to re-image win7 onto laptop as well?\n\nA: You can upgrade it just fine. If you open a terminal, you can upgrade with one command: sudo do-release-upgrade and the Update Manager GUI will also give you the option to upgrade from LTS to LTS. You can even go into your sources.list file and change all referenes of one release to another release, eg: \"precise\" to \"trusty\", then do an apt-get update and then apt-get dist-upgrade, but this is not a recommended method to upgrade with.\nIn future (or if you plan to do it now), consider making a minimum of two partitions for your Linux install - one for the root filesystem \"/\" of 20GB or more and a dedicated one for the home filesystem \"/home\" of the remainder of your drive. You can skimp on having a swap partition if you have 4GB or more of RAM if you're an average user.\nThe reason you split it like this will allow you to do a complete fresh install of Ubuntu without stomping all over your home data because the installer can be told to mount Partition XYZ as \"/home\" but then you uncheck the box to format that partition. The installer will set it up and when you boot into it, it will happily re-use your existing /home data with the worst of your housekeeping being perhaps changing UID's and GID's if your new user account doesn't have the same UID/GID as the old account (a big recursive chown command will fix that).\nAnd best of all is that through the entire process, your Windows 7 installation will be preserved. During the Ubuntu install, just delete the old Ubuntu partition(s) to recreate your new layout, but do not touch the Windows one(s). The installer will set Windows up in the GRUB menu whichever way you go.\n", "Q: No sound notification in KDE Plasma Desktop I installed the KDE plasma desktop yesterday on my Ubuntu 14.04 system.

I think this is where the problem is, so, could you please help me?\nAlso, I do not use the original Ubuntu, I use Lubuntu.\n\nA: For all others who stumble upon this post looking for a solution to this problem and aren't very Linux/Tech savy just like me, this was my solution and I'll try to explain it as simple as possible.\nI run Lubuntu 12.04, and I had the same problem. As the others mentioned above, Skype 4.3 no longer supports the ALSA sound driver (Too bad! I really hope they bring support back for ALSA! I personally like ALSA quite a bit better than PulseAudio.) and now solely relies upon PulseAudio as it's audio driver. As far as I'm aware Lubuntu (at least Lubuntu 12.04) doesn't come with PulseAudio, so you'll need to install that yourself. I used this code to do so: \nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio\n\nCopy that into the LXTerminal (located in the \"start\" menu - Accessories) and press Enter. Once the process finishes, PulseAudio should be installed and you can check to see if your Skype audio is working now.\n\nA: Skype 4.3 needs PulseAudio, so I recommend you to install Pulse Audio Volume Control (pavucontrol) from the Lubuntu Software Center.\nor try:\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio \n\nThen it will be opened if you make a right click on the volume icon and choose volume control settings. It has a tab called recording where Skype will be shown if \"Show Applications\" is chosen while you are making a call, for instance a test call. It ought to show your microphone is working.\nMore instructions are described in this support webpage of Skype for Linux.\n\nA: install this and it works :) \nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gxine libdvdread4 totem-mozilla icedax tagtool easytag id3tool lame nautilus-script-audio-convert libmad0 mpg321 gstreamer1.0-libav\n\n\nA: Skype dropped support for ALSA in version 4.3, which left it unable to discover or use the audio devices that worked in 4.2, unless PulseAudio is installed. If you are among the many users/admins for whom Pulse is not viable, you currently have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Skype 4.2 and edit the binary to spoof the version number.\n\n*Find an alternative to Skype.\nIt's worth noting that WebRTC is integrated into recent web browsers, and free video chat services that use it are starting to appear.

It works for me almost as good as google hangouts.\nHere are some other good links to checkout:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SkypeTroubleshooting\nHow do I install Skype?\nI've fought with Skype sound not working properly on xUbuntu and Mate over many installations. When mic and audio are working with all my other desktop apps, i'm hesitant to make global adjustments just for a Microsoft product. Mainly because of concerns with breaking other things that are working. \nI frequently have to remind myself that being on Linux only makes scene if you have both the configuration freedom and productivity. Chasing down why a Microsoft package doesn't work is just not worth the time for me when I can get what I need from that tool with Skype for web and google chrome.\n", "Q: How to do a full clone of a VM?

(If you're having specific problems with that, I recommend editing your question with more details.)\nAfter cloning the VM, if you want both virtual machines to access the same network at the same time, you'll probably want to change the MAC address on the virtual network adapter of one of the VMs.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any \"traps\" in cloning a VirtualBox VM for concurrent use on the same Host/LAN?\n\n*How do I fix broken networking in cloned virtual machines?\n\nA: Click on the sheep icon to clone your VM (including snapshots).

For example, for a 2 GB flash memory, total space that we can use, is 1.86 GB. \nAs far as I know, the difference is for metadata and filesystems. Is that right?\nMy question :\nIs there any command or program in linux, to see or use whole the 2GB space?\ncan I see those metadata and filesystems?\nAppreciate your time and consideration. \n\nA: Computers calculate numbers in base 2 (binary). The closest a computer can get to 1000 is 1024.\nManufacturers quote sizes in base 10, so from the manufacturer's point of view a 500GB drive is 500 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 = 500000000000 bytes. Nice round figures.\nFrom the computer's perspective, the same figure is 500 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 536870912000 bytes. A quick glance at that result might suggest it's a 536GB capacity drive, but we know that's not the case because it physically can only hold 500GB.\nSo a 500GB drive will show up on a computer as only having 465.66GB of space.\nNo-one has lied - the drive really is 500GB in size (a kilo of anything is 1000, not 1024), it's just that the computer cannot represent that exactly in base 2, so we get the next nearest figure.\n", "Q: apt-get update says \"Reading package lists ...

You need to do apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade the actual packages. People often combine the two as sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nA: apt-get update updates the available package index lists and is used to determine what needs to be updated on your system. It is also used to tell your system what other software is available for installing.\napt-get upgrade updates non-critical packages on your system based on the index. These updates typically do not require a reboot.\napt-get dist-upgrade updates non-critical and critical packages on your system based on the index (typically includes kernel updates). These updates typically require you to reboot afterwards for the updates to take effect (but you only need to reboot to start using those certain updates - it's not like something will break if you don't reboot right away).\n", "Q: Copy data held by www-data over ssh I have an apache server (machine #1) holding a database which I want to rsync distantly (the server is actually owncloud, for those who know). My data is maintained by the server and its rights are rwx------ www-data:www-data or so.\nNow I have another distant machine (machine #2) which I would like to use in order to backup the first machine's database. Machine #2 will run rsync over ssh and via a cron job. I am not sure which account to use in order to log to machine #1 via ssh.\n\n\n*\n\n*I understand the only 2 accounts which can read/copy the database on machine #1 are www-data and root. As I cannot login as www-data (this is a system account and I do not know the password), does that mean I need to login as root via ssh?\n\n*Is that possible? Is that safe?\n\n*Another way would be to create another account, add it to the www-data group and give the www-data group read rights.\n\n*Unfortunately this is not possible as it is the server (owncloud) and not me which gives the access rights to the database, and the rights given do not allow the www-data group to read the files (at least not on all files): see rwx------\n\n\nI am not sure how to get the accounts and rights organized so as to be able to rsync distantly. Any idea?\nThanks,\nAntoine.\n\nA: I would run mysqldump periodically on machine #1; this gives you one large file. This file can then be transferred to machine #2 using rsync (with compression, as it will contain only ASCII text, SQL statements really) without bothering about database permissions. On machine #2, the dump file is unreadable for anyone but the owner. And as your database on #1 can be reached from a local machine, you can even do the mysqldump locally, which is useful for testing the procedure.\nIf anything goes wrong on machine #1, you need to reload the database from the last good dump file. Basically, that is a one-line command that erases the whole database and loads it from the dump file. Backup and restore procedures are well documented and described e.g. here and more tips and tricks can be found by googling mysqldump.\nUsing this standard tool will be much more safe and straightforward than trying to transfer the data files yourself.\n", "Q: start screen UBUNTU 14.04 /mnt/sdc1 i had problems with start screen on UBUNTU 14.04, the message is below ubuntu log before start gnome. > (the disk unity to /mnt/sdc1 is not yeat ready or non mounted or present) and below is writed : Press )S) to scape or (M) to recovery manually!!!!\nHow can i solve it? \nThanaks a lot and sorry about the bad english :)\n\nA: It means that Ubuntu cannot find /mnt/sdc1 to mount it. If you have specifically specified \"/mnt/sdc1\" in your /etc/fstab file, change it to use UUID's instead as the drive has probably changed designations to something else.\nFor now, press \"S\" to skip mounting and allow the system to boot, then get into a terminal and type in blkid to get the UUID's of each drive on your system.\nIdentify the drive you originally setup as /mnt/sdc1 and copy down the UUID which will look something like this in the output:\n/dev/sdb1: LABEL=\"My_C_Drive\" **UUID=\"7378084A69DC3DF8\"** TYPE=\"ntfs\" (A Windows formatted drive)\n/dev/sdd1: **UUID=\"5fc6e3a5-a060-42f6-9368-9fded7e0d048\"** TYPE=\"ext4\" (A Linux formatted drive)\n\nThen in /etc/fstab, place that UUID down instead of the device name so the line looks something like:\n**UUID=5fc6e3a5-a060-42f6-9368-9fded7e0d048** /home           ext4    noatime        0       2\n\nIn the above example, we've setup device /dev/sdd1 which is EXT4 formatted to be mounted as \"/home\".\nSave, reboot and test.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 hangs / freezes frequently When I'm doing something on the desktop like using firefox and i want to minimize it and also using terminal and i want to minimize it, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS will just randomly freeze.

I ask this out of sheer curiosity.\nFor pasting - why wasn't Ctrl+v made as a shortcut - which is standard - instead of Ctrl+Shift+v - which is not standard?\nSame goes with so many other shortcuts (which are in common with other platforms). For scrolling up - Shift+PgUp instead of PgUp, as another example.\nSince this is deliberate, of course, then I am sure there is a logical explanation for it?\n\nA: Keyboard shortcuts used by Terminal are not available for programs running in the Terminal. That's why Terminal tries not to use shortcuts that are standard among command line programs.\nCtrl+V is a standard for \"Insert verbatim\", i.e. you can use for example Ctrl+VReturn to insert a carriage return character (ASCII #13). It is used for example by Bash and some editors.\nPgUp is used to scroll in text editors, pages and such, and people would likely get angry if that didn't work.\n", "Q: Headphone Input Missing 14.04 So I run an dual-boot Alienware M14x with Windows 8.1 as my main OS and Ubutnu 14.04 as my secondary.

I`ve been using Linux for four month.\nMint Qiana,Peppermint 3, Lubuntu14.04.1.\nWhen I set up my printer, I downloaded the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*cupswrapperHL2270DW-2.0.4-2.i386.deb  --Archive \n\n*Brother-HL-2170W-hpijs-pcl5e.ppd  --Text  \n\n*hl2270dwlpr-2.1.0-1.i386.deb  --Archive\n\n\nMy printer may be using these files when printing or have already use them in some manner. These files are designated Type: Archive.\nDo these files have to be permanently in the Downloads folder?\nAre they being used by the OS where they currently reside or are they remnants from the installation and can be removed/deleted because they have already been incorporated within my printer setup?\nIf these .deb files are being used, where should they normally be placed other than the Downloads folder or is the Downloads folder the only place to keep these files so they can be used to print?\nIf these files must be kept, how would I safely relocated them from the Downloads folder and place them in the normal file system so that they remain functional for printing?  \nRegarding the Brother ppd.Text file : \nThis file was also sent to the Printer software interface and is being used. \nCan this file be safety removed?\n I'm not 100% sure I can remove it without rendering my printer setup relegated to become useless?\nHere again, the same above questions apply, only in this case regarding this particular Text file.  \nTo answer my own questions, I'm guessing the answer to be:\nThe ppdText/.deb files: OK to delete them, OS software has stored-saved them in some form and has completed using them. These are remnants and will not effect your printer/other interface/operation if you delete/permanently remove them.  \n\nA: You have downloaded a .deb file; the next step would be to do sudo dpkg -i nameofdebfile.deb. If you have done that, the contents are moved elsewhere and it's OK to delete the .deb file. If you haven't, the OS is not using it.\nAs for the .ppd file: this was copied to a system location (under /etc or /usr) when you installed the printer. If the printer works fine, you can delete it.\nSuppose you were not the only user of your computer. Somebody else might like to use that printer as well. So it wouldn't be logical to leave these configuration files in the private folders of a common user. As an administrator, with your sudo hat on, you placed them in a location that is \"system-wide\" and can be used by any user.\n", "Q: Unable to open Ubuntu after installation on Sony Vaio I had Windows 8 64 bit preinstalled on Sony Vaio Model:SVF15213SNB.\nI then booted from the Ubuntu 14.04 USB drive and I created root,home,swap out of a 20 GB partition.\nOn restart it then showed GRUB where I chose the Windows 8 to boot into, I then restarted but this time GRUB didn't load and Windows 8 automatically started.\nI then tried to reinstall Ubuntu and during the setup it showed that I already had Ubuntu 14.04 installed on the system.\nI chose the option \"Replace Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\" hence removing the old Ubuntu installation and replace it with a new installation.\nAfter the installation GRUB didnt load and it automatically booted Ubuntu 14.04.

I have 12.04LTS installed in wubi and want to know if and how I can upgrade to 14.04LTS.\nI do not want a new installation, as that would totally disrupt my current activities and programming.\n\nA: Simply running sudo do-release-upgrade -d from the terminal prompt will take care of it for you. Try to run it from the console on the computer you're upgrading, since if you do it via a terminal session from another system (via ssh or something similar) if the upgrade has issues, or your connection drops, recovering could be problematic.\nIt worked for me, but not before without issues, as my ssh session timed out multiple times duing the upgrade.  I discovered the best way to handle it was to run screen, then run the do-release-upgrade -d from within screen, that way, if you do loose your connection, a simple screen -d will give you back your previous screens, all nice and orderly as they should be.\nI did the 12.04 LTS upgrade to 14.04 LTS, but then (accidentally) wound upgrading again to the latest unicorn release too, as I wound typing do-release-upgrade -d again, with my scrollback buffer, so now I'm running a full-blown test release, and having issues, but that's not the fault of the initial do-release-upgrade run.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: how to get rid of ChromiumOS I tried to install ChromiumOS in Ubuntu, didnt work out, and now when I do\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI got this:\nReading package lists...

Way slower than second one After a reboot, the first search using Unity Dash will be slower (15 sec) than the second search (seems instant), on my system at least. I guess this is because file index is cleared after a reboot and recreated as soon as first Unity Dash search is done.\nIf this is the case, auto-recreating index at system start-up should work.

On my side I am now pretty happy with Ubuntu Gnome and a customized Cairo-dock!\n\nA: Like the asker, I too mainly used the Dash for opening applications. There are things (e.g. those mentioned above by others) that can speed up the Dash. However, I found start startup speed remained an issue - presumably due to re-indexing. The best solution for me was to use \"Gnome Do\" instead. It's very neat and very fast.

I am new to ubuntu.\nThanks!\n\nA: Lets break apart the file name: 14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\n14.04.1 is the most current stable version of Ubuntu available for download.\nSo you would be encouraged to download and install that version.\ndesktop is best for most users that want to run Ubuntu on their laptop and want to use a graphical user interface.\nFor a beginner, this is recommended.\ni386 is a 32-bit image and should be used if you computer does not support 64-bit software.\namd64 is a 64-bit image and can be used if your hardware supports it. This version may provide better performance.\nTo find out if your hardware supports 64-bit, you can check within the BIOS. Or any site that details the computer's features. This capability is a property of the CPU so in the case that you don't have stock hardware, the CPU is the hardware to research.\nBottom line:\n14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso is a good choice.\nHowever if your computer can support a 64-bit OS, 14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso may provide better performance.\n", "Q: Getting error downloading java programmer E: Failed to fetch ftp://ftp.iitb.ac.in/os/ubuntu/archives/pool/main/o/openjdk-7/icedtea-7-jre-jamvm_7u55-2.4.7-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb  Unable to fetch file, server said 'Failed to open file.

Navigate to India -> mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in select the protocol as http\n\nClose Software Centre and then open a terminal and try the below command.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\nA: Try changing the mirror Manish. \nTo do this , go to System Settings -> Softwares & Updates -> Ubuntu Software and select 'Main Server' or 'Other...' to select other mirrors.\nIf you select Other... option you can select any other mirror other than the Indian mirrors\n\n", "Q: nm-applet does not work Ubuntu 14.04 The network manager nm-applet has disappeared from the unity panel of my Ubuntu 14.04. When I try to run it from the commas line, I receive an error:\n$ nm-applet\nnm-applet-Message: using fallback from indicator to GtkStatusIcon\n\n(nm-applet:6409): nm-applet-WARNING **: Could not find ShellVersion property on org.gnome.Shell after 5 tries\n\nI do not know if it is directly related but ever since this, running System Settings-> Network does not display 'Mobile Broadband' even though the datacard is connected to the system. The datacard does not work any more.\nEDIT:\nThe following command as suggested by user 'mkayaalp' also gives an error:\n$ nm-applet --shell-debug\nnm-applet-Message: using fallback from indicator to GtkStatusIcon\n\n(nm-applet:6848): nm-applet-WARNING **: Could not find ShellVersion property on org.gnome.Shell after 5 tries\nnm-applet-Message: PID 0 (we are 6848) sent signal 2, shutting down...\n\n(nm-applet:6848): GLib-CRITICAL **: Source ID 107 was not found when attempting to remove it\n\nEDIT2:\nThe problem of the icon for nm-applet not appearing on the unity panel is not unique to it. This problem also persists for 'Psensors' even though in options it is set to show on the unity panel.\nP.S.: Searching on google and on askubuntu.com mainly brings up results regarding Lubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: I'm afraid both messages look unrelated to your problem with Mobile Broadband connection. \nnm-applet-Message: using fallback from indicator to GtkStatusIcon\n\nsimply means that a Gnome Panel was not found and it is using the status icon instead.\nnm-applet-WARNING **: Could not find ShellVersion property on org.gnome.Shell after 5 tries\n\nThis message means that it tried to get the version of the Gnome Shell from DBus but failed for 5 attempts. On my system, there is no org.gnome.Shell service. But you apparently have and there is something wrong with it.\nOne thing you might want to try is running it as:\nnm-applet --shell-debug\n\nThis should remove that second message, but I doubt it will resolve the broadband issue. \nEDIT: I should mention that both these messages are not errors. \nThe following means that SIGINT was delivered and applet is exiting, which is what happens when you hit Ctrl+C in the terminal.\nnm-applet-Message: PID 0 (we are 6848) sent signal 2, shutting down...\n\nFor next message, see this bug. It is GLib warning and not an error. nm-applet gives the same messages on my system (except for the dbus related message) and it works.\n(nm-applet:6848): GLib-CRITICAL **: Source ID 107 was not found when attempting to remove it\n\nSince you say the same thing goes for psensors, I am convinced that your problem is not nm-applet. It looks like your systray is missing. Try to run the following minimal python script for creating a status icon and see if anything shows up:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport pygtk\nimport gtk\n\ni = gtk.StatusIcon()\ni.set_from_stock(gtk.STOCK_INFO)\ni.set_visible(True)\ngtk.main()\n\nPut this in a file and name it test.py. Execute chmod +x test.py and ./test.py. You might need to install python-gtk package, if not installed. \n\nA: nm-applet disappeared from the Unity menu bar on a recent install of Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS.  This may have happened after an apt-get upgrade and a reboot.\nThe solution that worked for me was mentioned in the comments of another post.\n\nSome people resolved similar issues by installing/reinstalling libappindicator. I guess Unity moved from status icons to indicators. –  mkayaalp Aug 16 '14 at 18:35\nWow, the solution was the one buried in the comments by @mkayaalp. What I did was to run: 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall libappindicator3-1' and 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall libappindicator1'. Then restart. –  noisygecko Jan 8 at 16:25\n\nSince it worked for me, I thought I would make a separate answer for it.  I ran the below:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libappindicator3-1 libappindicator1\n\nThen I rebooted. It may be that only the first package re-installation is necessary.\n\nA: What fixed the issue here (Mint 17, compatible with Ubuntu 14.04) was:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager-gnome\nsudo service dbus restart\nfollowed by a logout and then a login. In fact, many other notification area indicators were missing (not only nm-applet), and this fixed them all. \n\nA: Tried many possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting nm-applet in terminal: message about using gtk fallback\n\n*Reinstall nm-applet\n\n*Reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\n*Reinstall network-manager and network-manager-gnome\n\n*Reinstall indicator-applet-complete\n\n*Edit ~/.config/autostart/nm-applet.desktop to use Exec=/usr/bin/dbus-launch nm-applet\n\n*Stop NetworkManager, sudo rm /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state, Start NetworkManager\n\n\netc..\nWhen searching for nm-applet on google, I found https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Nm-applet.\nAfter adding my user to netdev group I'm able to start nm-applet in terminal and the icon appears.\nTried to reset the default nm-applet.desktop autostart and restarted, but nothing.\nFinally added a custom startup application to execute /usr/bin/nm-applet.\nHope this helps somebody.\n\nA: Change 'deny' to 'allow' in :\n/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.conf\n\nThe network-manager or the nm-applet is the one which is found in the systray. I used this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager#Installation\nand did the following :\nsudo stop network-manager\nsudo apt-get install network-manager\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome\nsudo start network-manager\n\nlogged out, then logged back in and the icon in the systray shows and wifi and networks report.\nTo confirm network is connected, run :\n/sbin/ifconfig -a\n\n\nA: I had this problem and I fixed it by reinstalling ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nAlso, I got rid of the gnome staging and gnome next ppa(s).\n\nA: For Ubuntu 14.04 I reinstall network-manager, and everything now works fine.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager-gnome\n\nA: Add the notification area to your panel. You do so by right-clicking on the panel, \"Add to Panel...\" and choosing Notification Area:\n\nThis gives you the network manager applet (nm-applet), the sound / volume chooser and the battery indicator.\n\nA: Try reinstalling nm-applet:\nsudo apt-get remove nm-applet\n\nsudo apt-get install nm-applet\n\n", "Q: ASUS Laptop touchpad not working I am using Asus X450LA and Ubuntu 14.04.

We support PCs running any version of Windows as well as Macs and Linux\"\n\nBut they don't provide a guide on how to do it. Generally, if they support Macs and Android, this means that the VPN technology they are using should be configurable on Linux, you just need a little bit of knowledge on how to configure it.\nYou'll need to use software on Ubuntu called OpenVPN or vpnc for example.

I am setting it in Permitted, Effective, and Inherited sets (setcap 'cap_net_bind_service+eip' EXEC).\nI can su to the non-privileged user, and run it directly, and it works perfectly. It correctly binds the port, and /proc/PID/status shows the proper capabilities masks with 0x400 bit set.\nBut when I start the service via upstart it does not run with the capabilities specified for the binary, and the bind() fails (EPERM). /proc/PID/status shows capabilities masks are all 0.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I'm now thinking this is a bug, and related to the way upstart starts services with \"expect daemon\" (i.e. services that fork twice upon startup). I notice that if I use strace on a process that is using capabilities(7) the capabilities are also ignored. I suspect that upstart, in order to determine the PID to wait on, traces a service specified with \"expect daemon\" long enough to obtain the PID, and that's causing the kernel capabilities mechanism to fail. So the bug is in the way that capabilities interact with process tracing, and the fact that upstart uses process tracing when starting a service with \"expect daemon\" (this is supposition).\nAs a simple test:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a small C PROGRAM to bind to port 443 (you cannot use an interpreted language such as python with capabilities(7)).\n\n*Run it as non-root, and see that it fails to bind due to lack of privilege.\n\n*Set the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability for your PROGRAM (as root run setcap 'cap_net_bind_service+epi' PROGRAM)\n\n*Run it as non-root, and see that it now succeeds.\n\n*Now run it with strace, and see that it now fails.\n\n\n(note that in step 3 strictly speaking the Inherited capability set (i flag) does not need to be modified for this test, but it does for a process that forks() such as my daemon).\nThis behavior is necessary to avoid privilege exploits but makes Upstart behavior incompatible with Capabilities.\n", "Q: Can't locate package (gimp) in terminal, and in the software center says 'not found' I desperately need to install Gimp on my computer.

I recently installed Ubuntu in my system and I am already in love with it.\nMy question is, as my system came with a dedicated Nvidia graphics card installed in it, so do I really need to install the driver for it? because my system is doing good so far and in the details section it only shows the Intel graphics, which is the integrated one I guess.\nAs far as I know there aren't much high-end games for Ubuntu that requires a dedicated graphics card, so will it be worth installing a graphics driver for it?\nThanks.\n\nA: I'm inferring a laptop's \"Optimus\" setup from your question.\nIf you don't need it, using the Intel card alone is probably more power efficient but that relies on the discrete graphics card dropping into lower power levels, controlling fans accurately, etc. I would suspect that for it to work as designed, you'll still need the proprietary driver installed.\nThat will also give you the option  of running things through optirun (or whatever system you use) in the future for 3D-heavy games if you want to.

I'm currently fiddling around with using ansible to setup my machine with my chosen configuration/apps etc... I've hit a stumbling block with steam and it's licence agreement. I've been trying to use debconf to pre-accept it.\nHere's one of the relevant files in the steam source:\nhttp://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/utopic/steam/utopic/view/head:/debian/preinst\nI've tried echo steam steam/question select \"I AGREE\" | sudo debconf-set-selections and a whole bunch of other very similar command also involving trying to set the licence as seen.\nHere's the output of sudo debconf-show steam:\n\n  steam/purge:\n* steam/license:\n* steam/question: I AGREE\n\nEverything I've tried has led to apt-get thinking I've pre-disagreed to the licence agreement and I have to remove those entries before I'm able to install steam. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: Using your research and the link provided in the comments of your post, I figured this out. As of 15.04 (on 2015-09-24), the steam package in the Ubuntu repositories is still 1.0.0.48, but you need 1.0.0.50 to properly read the debconf settings.\nI found that the steam.deb you can download from the Steam downloads page is 1.0.0.50, so if you install from this file, with the debconf settings, it should work.\nI use saltstack, and here is my working state for steam:\nsteam:\n  debconf.set:\n    - data:\n        steam/question: {'type': 'select', 'value': 'I AGREE'}\n        steam/license: {'type': 'note', 'value': ''}\n  pkg.installed:\n    - sources:\n      - steam-launcher: https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steam.deb\n    - require:\n      - debconf: steam\n\n\nA: 5 years late, but I have the following ansible tasks that seems to work with Debian 9 and 10, tested with molecule and docker.\nProvided you have already setup a device with x11 and mesa/preferred graphics drivers, something like this could work:\n- name: Add i386 arch\n  command: dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n- name: accept steam license\n  debconf:\n    name: \"steam\"\n    question: \"steam/question\"\n    value: \"I AGREE\"\n    vtype: \"select\"\n\n- name: Install steam\n  apt:\n   name: steam\n   update_cache: yes\n   state: present\n\n\nA: As stated in the original question you can simply use the command line to set the required values before you attempt to install Steam.\necho steam steam/question select \"I AGREE\" | sudo debconf-set-selections\necho steam steam/license note '' | sudo debconf-set-selections\n\nIt is likely there was a bug in the package (packaging is notoriously hard if it isn't your primary responsibility) and later versions should now work and read the pre-accepted license from the debconf database. This means you shouldn't get prompted.\nsudo apt-get install steam\n\nThe typical format is below:\necho package package/key {boolean,string} {true, some string} | sudo debconf-set-selections\nsudo apt-get install package\n\nThe helpful Q&A for this was https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/106553\n", "Q: Creating a large size file in less time I want to create a large file ~10G filled with zeros and random values. I have tried using:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=10Gfile bs=5G count=10\n\nIt creates a file of about 2Gb and exits with a exit status '0'. I fail to understand why?\nI also tried creating file using:\nhead -c 10G </dev/urandom >myfile\n\nIt takes about 28-30 mins to create it. But I want it created faster. Anyone has a solution?\nAlso i wish to create multiple files with same (pseudo) random pattern for comparison. Does anyone know a way to do that? \n\nA: Using dd, this should create a 10 GB file filled with random data:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=test1 bs=1M count=10240\n\ncount is in megabytes.\nSource: stackoverflow - How to create a file with a given size in Linux?\n\nA: How about using fallocate, this tool allows us to preallocate space for a file (if the filesystem supports this feature).  For example, allocating 5GB of data to a file called 'example', one can do:\nfallocate -l 5G example\n\nThis is much faster than dd, and will allocate the space very rapidly.\n\nA: This question was opened 5 years ago. I just stumbled across this and wanted to add my findings.\nIf you simply use\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=random.img count=1024 bs=10M\n\nit will work significantly faster as explained by xiaodongjie. But, you can make it even faster by using eatmydata like\neatmydata dd if=/dev/urandom of=random.img count=1024 bs=10M\n\nWhat eatmydata does is it disables fsync making the disc write faster.\nYou can read more about it at https://flamingspork.com/projects/libeatmydata/.\n\nA: You can use dd to create a file consisting solely of zeros. Example: \ndd if=/dev/zero of=zeros.img count=1 bs=1 seek=$((10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 - 1))\n\nThis is very fast because only one byte is really written to the physical disc. However, some file systems do not support this.\nIf you want to create a file containing pseudo-random contents, run:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=random.img count=1024 bs=10M\n\nI suggest that you use 10M as buffer size (bs). This is because 10M is not too large, but it still gives you a good buffer size. It should be pretty fast, but it always depends on your disk speed and processing power.\n\nA: Answering the first part of your question:\nTrying to write a buffer of 5GB at a time is not a good idea as your kernel probably doesn't support that. It won't give you any performance benefit in any case. Writing 1M at a time is a good maximum.\n", "Q: can't ping to a friend's computer I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed and I recently installed the same version from the same CD on my friend's computer. When I try to ping him I don't get any response, when I press Ctrl C to terminate ping it says it sent some number of packets, but none of them were received, 100% packet loss. I thought he might have a firewall installed, but that's unlikely because I just installed his Ubuntu. I read iptables comes with Ubuntu, but if so, why can he ping me and I can't ping him?\nThe two computers are not connected to a shared network, I'd like to ping him just like I can ping www.google.com.\n\nA: A very good way of troubleshooting why pings don't work can be done using traceroute:\ntraceroute -n <IPaddress>\n\nIf it is not installed, you can install it using sudo apt-get install traceroute.\nFrom your comments on the question, you ran traceroute and it stopped at a certain IP address and displayed * * * asterisks afterwards, something like this:\ntraceroute to <IPaddress>, 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n 1  1.1.1.1  75.415 ms  75.348 ms  75.298 ms\n 2  2.2.2.2  28.026 ms  28.025 ms  30.207 ms\n 3  3.3.3.3  40.006 ms  39.999 ms  45.287 ms\n 4  4.4.4.4  118.244 ms  90.393 ms  90.350 ms\n 5  * * *\n 6  * * *\n 7  * * *\n 8  * * *\n\nThis means that the traceroute got blocked and did not reach the destination. The network device 4.4.4.4 (or the device after it) is the device that is blocking the connection. Since you're going over the internet, I assume that these devices are not controlled by you. This means that you will not be able to ping your friend's IP because something on the internet is blocking it. He can ping you because there's nothing blocking pings originating from his network (that can also include the 4.4.4.4 device that is blocking your pings).\nYou can double check this by trying to ping his IP address from a different device, a device that is in a different LAN network than you, to verify that probably no one can ping his IP address (and that his ISP is probably blocking it).\n", "Q: How to get back unity and compiz after uninstalling, no launcher or dash on startup I've gone through a ton of threads regarding this issue with nothing working for me.

One day I was at home, connected to my usual wireless connection, watching a show, and suddenly it stopped loading the episode and I lost my connection. From that moment on I am able to connect to other wireless connections, but not my own, my network doesn't even appears in the list. Everything is fine with my wireless connection, because it continued to work fine in other computers. I didn't change my internet provider or any equipment. This happened several days ago, since then I restarted my computer several times, I unplugged and replugged the router cable, I even installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my computer, which I am using now, and nothing worked.\nPS - I'm fairly new at Linux. \nIf anyone can help me, thank you.\nMiguel Pinto\n\nA: No idea why this happens but whenever I've used certain 'brand' routers with OS X or Ubuntu, they'll silently drop connection for no reason. Or let the machine connect but refuse to give you any internet access. Try unplgging the router for about 5 minutes and then plugging it back in. Should fix it.\n", "Q: Move unallocated space so it can be assigned to an existing partition I have an issue that I cannot seem to solve, please see the following screenshot:\n\nThe circles represent the key symbols which aren't removed even during live session from a bootable USB of Xubuntu.\nWhat I'm trying to achieve is to move the unallocated space all the way to the bottom so I can merge it with sda7.\nI already tried all sorts of techniques of resizing and what not, it simply doesn't allow me to move that partition, it won't get past sda4.\n\nA: An extended partition is locked whenever any logical partition within it is mounted. In a live session, swap gets automatically enabled, so the swap partition (in this case sda6) will be mounted. Hence sda6 and consequently sda4 become locked. To unlock an extended partition, you have to unmount the logical partitions within it by right clicking them and choosing Unmount (or Swapoff in the case of swap partitions).\n", "Q: what could be blocking port 5060 on my ubuntu 14.04?

But the connection got terminated by the destination host as soon as it was created, that's why it directly goes to Connection closed by foreign host. This is probably because the program that is listening on that port is expecting some data as soon as a connection was created, or maybe the program needs to be configured in a different way.\nIf a port is being blocked (or is not open), you will never see Conneted to <IPaddress>, but you'd see something like this:\nTrying <IPaddress>...\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\n\nYou did the right thing by checking iptables, but since there are no rules blocking the traffic, you can further verify that the server in fact has port 5060 open by executing the following command:\nnetstat -ntlup | grep 5060\n\nYou should see an output like this:\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5060             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN\n\n", "Q: Is there a better command to use than Sudo?

I'll keep trying to figure out what's wrong, till then, but any help is appreciated. \n\nA: External drives often get enormous memory cache for filesystem. In this case, if you copy files to/from hard drive, the copy process would immediately report success, then go on with actual copying in background. The telltale sign of this is a long unmounting. You may use these files as normal ones right after copying, even edit them, just don't plug off your external HDD without unmounting, which will make sure all background processes finished.\nIn Terminal, there is sync command, which will not return until backgound processes on all drives are finished. \n", "Q: How can I install 3.16 kernel on Ubuntu 14.04 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade do not show the newest kernel.  \nHow can I install 3.16 kernel on 14.04?\n\nA: To install the latest kernel you can always visit kernel.ubuntu.com to see what's going on.\nTo install the latest 3.16 kernel all you need to do is:\ncd /tmp\n\nfor 32bit:\nwget \\\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.16-utopic/linux-headers-3.16.0-031600-generic_3.16.0-031600.201408031935_i386.deb \\\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.16-utopic/linux-headers-3.16.0-031600_3.16.0-031600.201408031935_all.deb \\\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.16-utopic/linux-image-3.16.0-031600-generic_3.16.0-031600.201408031935_i386.deb\n\nfor 64bit:\nwget \\\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.16-utopic/linux-headers-3.16.0-031600-generic_3.16.0-031600.201408031935_amd64.deb \\\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.16-utopic/linux-headers-3.16.0-031600_3.16.0-031600.201408031935_all.deb \\\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.16-utopic/linux-image-3.16.0-031600-lowlatency_3.16.0-031600.201408031935_amd64.deb\n\nthen, making sure you have no other .debs in  /tmp\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nthen\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: I do recommend using the linux-image-generic-lts-utopic or whatever newer made available for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nTry avoid mixing release repositories, it may break things.\nIf linux-image-generic-lts-$(lsb_release -sc) is NOT new enough for you, try the Ubuntu Kernel mainline archive (manually download and install) http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n\nNOTE: the drawback of using mainline kernel is that you may not be able to compile drivers or things like VirtualBox won't work with the cutting edge kernel.

It would always do that. I just left it alone. I REALLY need to use GIMP right now because it is my best choice for what I have to edit, and it still does not work. \nEarlier today, it gave me that blue splat a couple times and relaunch obviously does not work. My cursor just loads for 10-20 seconds and nothing happens. Now, I am not even getting an error. The cursor just loads for 10-20 seconds and stops. I uninstalled GIMP and reinstalled it twice today, and no more error message. It just loads and stops. \nI have no idea what to do. I need GIMP and I do not even know what the problem is.

I search everywhere and almost everyone was suggesting to open the ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases, then put the alias command there, I created a function name palias as permanent alias function and put it in ~/.bashrc: \nfunction palias(){ echo \"alias $1='$2'\" >> /home/User/.bashrc;}\n\nSo now if I want to permanently alias some command I just :\npalias update \"sudo apt-get update\"\n\nI wonder if there is a built in command like this function, or anything like this to install from repositories?\n\nA: I suggest (of course you don't have to) putting an eval \"$_\" after the echo command, so the alias is added right away, and a grep -Pq \"alias $1\" && return at the start, to make sure that (1) you don't have duplicate alias names, (2) aliases get defined right away instead of waiting for them to be re-sourced.\nIf you want to get even more creative (this is how I do it), also allow it to take a number from your history, and define it as an alias, or a group of numbers assigned in sequence to one alias, or more, etc.\nI've put quite a lot of work into my own .bashrc over the years -- I do share it under a project called gxbase, but since it is \"my preferences\" it most likely is not what \"other people\" want. Configuration settings are a very personal thing. Most people expect things to look like /etc/skel/.bashrc, and stuff like bash completion stops working if you set too many custom options :) Just for fun though, my link is http://gitorious.org/gxbase. The file is in extras/my.bashrc/* (see PS at bottom if interested).\nAs for your question, there are many people out there who post their so-called 'ultimate .bashrc settings' but alas they are only ultimate for them, my answer is: you will be happiest if you create this file yourself, and believe me, for the love of all that's holy; make [offline] backups!!! :) A 'hard (printed) copy' is a good way to plan it further if you want to get even more creative!\n\nPS: The contents of .bashrc-git are a fork from the gitsh project, so most of the credit for that one goes to that guy, and the perlconsole & aptsh integration also are not mine (entirely). You'll have to install the modded perlconsole & aptsh files to get that fully integrated into virtual directories.\n\nA: There is no bash builtin to add permanent aliases. Such aliases are created by adding them to a configuration file that is sourced by interactive shells, as you've done with .bashrc.\nBut you might consider modifying your palias() implementation by making it put the aliases in a separate file. I think this may be considered an improvement, for six reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file that is mostly edited automatically can be separate from the file that is mostly edited manually. If you need to see what has happened--out of curiosity, or to investigate a problem--this separation may be helpful. (Or if the function is accidentally called many times, creating a large number of unnecessary lines, the damage will be somewhat more contained.)\n\n*By putting the individual, automatically generated alias definitions elsewhere than .bashrc, you create a system that \"works behind the scenes,\" which is often what people want when they look for a dedicated builtin to perform a task.\n\n*.bashrc is already usually quite complicated. It will be easier to read and modify for unrelated purposes if it's not filled with many user-defined automatically appended aliases.\n\n*Simple implementations of palias() -- including what you've written and what I'm about to recommend -- will create bad lines if the file they're appending to is not already newline-terminated (or blank). Normally text editors do this for you but it's possible to accidentally end a text file without a newline, in which case palias() will create a munged-together line that may or may not be correct, and which either way would be very difficult to read. By putting aliases in a separate file that you rarely, or at least less frequently, edit manually, you decrease the risk of this.\n\n*If you ever expand your palias() implementation to read the existing contents of its target file, for example, to give useful warnings, it may be much easier to do so if can be assumed to consist entirely of alias definitions. (Or, for more sophisticated parsing: entirely of alias definitions and lines assumed to be wrong.)\n\n*It is already widely suggested (though admittedly not as any sort of strong admonition) to put new aliases in a separate file: .bash_aliases\nSee How do I create a permanent Bash alias? for more information about places to put aliases.\nDefault .bashrc files in Ubuntu contain the code:\n# Alias definitions.\n# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like\n# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.\n# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.\n\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n    . ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\nThus if you create .bash_aliases, it will be used. The command to define the palias() function can then be:\npalias() { echo \"alias $1='$2'\" >> ~/.bash_aliases; }\n\nThat command should still go in .bashrc, but the aliases it creates will be placed in .bash_aliases.\nMore sophisticated implementations are possible. You could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the definition as well as adding it, so it's immediately usable. This is suggested in osirisgothra's answer. I'd use:\npalias() { echo \"alias $1='$2'\" >> ~/.bash_aliases; alias \"$1=$2\"; }\n\n\n*Check to ensure .bash_aliases is nonexistent, empty, or newline-terminated, and if it is nonempty but not newline-terminated, append a newline prior to the alias definition.\npalias() {\n    local target=~/.bash_aliases\n    [[ -f \"$target\" && -n $(tail -c1 \"$target\") ]] && echo >> \"$target\"\n    echo \"alias $1='$2'\" >> \"$target\"\n}\n\nSee Gilles's answer to Add missing newlines in multiple files for details on detecting missing newlines with tail.\n\n*Check and warn about defining an alias that has already been defined in .bash_aliases.\nPloutox suggested that idea. But I do not recommend using grep $1 ~/.bash_aliases or similar, because it will produce frequent false positives, anytime $1 matches any part of another alias's definition, and occasional false negatives. The matter is further complicated by how some valid bash aliases, taken as regular expressions, match more than themselves--+ and . actually get used in command and alias names--and a few don't match even themselves.\ngrep \"alias $1=\" is better but mitigates the problem only partially. A leading ^ in the pattern would pretty well match only the leading alias name of a definition, but not address the problem of regexp metacharacters in $1, while using grep -F would strip all metacharacters of their special meaning but in doing so prevent ^ from being used.\ngreping .bashrc in this way is even worse than .bash_aliases, as there's an essentially unlimited variety of text that may be part of that file, mostly outside any alias definitions. \nIf you want to check for aliases that are defined in the current shell, whether or not they're written in .bash_aliases (or anywhere), you can use alias \"$1\" (or run alias with no arguments and match, carefully, against its output). Credit goes to muru for this idea. It does have the disadvantage that if you define an alias with alias to test it out and then make it permanent with palias, you'll get a warning even though it was not yet permanent and everything is fine.\nTo check new permanent aliases against the contents of .bash_aliases, you could do something like this:\npalias() {\n    local target=~/.bash_aliases\n\n    if grep -Pqs '^[ \\t]*alias[ \\t]+\\Q'\"$1\"'\\E\\=' \"$target\"; then\n        printf \"%s: %s: warning: defining \\`%s' again in %s\\n\" \\\n                    \"$0\" \"$FUNCNAME\" \"$1\" \"$target\" >&2\n    fi\n\n    echo \"alias $1='$2'\" >> \"$target\"\n}\n\nThat seems to work well, though I suspect there are more elegant ways. (Arguably [ \\t]* should be removed, if you take leading whitespace before alias as a suggestion that it is part of a multiline alias definition.) It will malfunction if \\E appears in $1, but shell metacharacters and quoting characters like \\ aren't valid in alias names, so you won't need to give that as input.\nIdeally, on any wrong input, any user-facing function you call would perform no operation except printing a useful error message. But by the nature of palias(), at least unless you're prepared to make its definition far more sophisticated (see below), the burden of reasonable input already falls mostly on the user. You can write non-aliases and alias definition syntax errors to .bash_aliases with this function, and while that's probably acceptable given the way you'll be using palias(), choking on \\E is minor in comparison.\nMore seriously, alias name1='def1' name2='def2' ... is perfectly good syntax for the alias command, but I haven't tried to parse out alias definitions given as subsequent arguments to alias in .bash_aliases, as I believe correctly determining where the first non-quoted blank occurs would be non-trivial.\nTherefore, if you use the above palias() implementation and also sometimes manually define aliases in .bash_aliases (or whatever file you use as $target), you should define just one alias per alias ... line if you want to have reliable warning behavior.\nIt will also fail to recognize alias definitions to the right of a ; or other connectives, for example to chain separate alias commands on the same line, but it seems unlikely you'd want to do that in .bash_aliases.\n\n*Parse $1 to ensure it is a valid name for an alias.\n\n*Parse $2 to attempt to figure out if it is a plausible body for an alias, and if it is not, then warn, fail, or (where applicable) quote it properly. For example, what happens if a ' character appears in $2?\n\n*Do a simpler version of that instead, just checking for and addressing ' in $2.\nBut you likely don't want to bother with any of that. You know how your function works, its limitations, and how to use it properly. I see four options for you that are at the same time reasonably good and pretty simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just keep using what you have now.\n\n*Use an implementation as above, putting the aliases in .bash_aliases instead of .bashrc.\n\n*Make a third file for automatically added aliases, and source that file separately (either in .bashrc or .bash_alises.\n\n*Don't use a palias() function at all, and just manually add aliases by editing .bash_aliases or .bashrc.\n\n", "Q: update manager unable to detect internet My Ubuntu 12.04 update manager is unable to connect to the internet. \nI was able to download updates a month back with my older internet connection.\nNow with my new internet connection , I am able to browse internet/download using Firefox, but I'm unable to download Ubuntu updates.\nsudo apt-get update gives:\nErr http://extras.ubuntu.com precise Release.gpg\n  Connection failed\nW: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise-updates/universe/i18n/Translation-en  Connection failed\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I want to add a new Hotkey: When I press F1 it will do the same as Shift+F1 does. I have added a new Custom Shortcut (System -> Keyboard) but I don't know the command to run like we press F1. I appreciate your help.\n\nA: If you want to add a new Hotkey, for example when you press Shift+F1 call F1 commands, you will need an extra softwae as xbindkeys: xdotool or xte. I follow by using xte.\n1. Install xbindkeys:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\n2. Then install xte:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\nThe syntax for xte is like this: xte 'command key/mousebutton/xyCoordinates'\nfor examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*To call a single key press:  xte 'key keyName'\n\n*To call a key combination:  xte 'keydown keyName' 'keydown secondKeyName' 'keyup keyName' 'keyup secondKeyName\n\n*And more!

Find the name of a key: xbindkeys allows us to use the -k handle to find the name of a key or key combination.\nRun xbindkeys -k  and press a key or key combination.\nIf you pressing Shif+F1 your output will look something similar to this:\n\"(Scheme function)\"\n    m:0x11 + c:67\n    Shift+Mod2 + F1\n\nThe basic syntax of xbindkeysrc commands is like this:\n\"Command to run (in quotes)\"\nkey to associate with command (no quotes)  \n\nso as you can see at above.\n4. Create a file named .xbindkeysrc in your home directory:\ntouch $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n\n5. Now open .xbindkeysrc file.\ngedit .xbindkeysrc\n\n6. Bind key/key combination to another key/key combination:\nSo according to first example of xte syntax in step 2, we have this:\nxte 'key keyName'\n\nOk, now combine this command with output of pressing Shif+F1 in step 3 and put in or type into .xbindkeysrc file that we opened in step 5. like this:\n\"xte 'key F1'\"\nShift+Mod2 + F1\n\n7. Save it and exit. Now you might notice your command doesn't work yet, that's because xbindkeys isn't running. To start it just run xbindkeys from a terminal.

When the terminal is open (Ctrl+Alt+T) it shows username@name: ~$. Is there any problem with my permissions? It was /$ before, but I don't know why it changed. \n\nA: ~ (a home folder) has always been the default one.

If the terminal started up in /, that means you had non-standard configuration (at least for Ubuntu) - the $HOME directory was missing, the terminal or shell was configured to use / as the startup directory, or PS1 contained something other than the standard.

Everything works great without needing to live boot... except one problem I can't figure out. Every time I boot into Windows, it rearranges the boot order to what appears to be default settings. Let me clarify, if I boot into Ubuntu and restart, then I go to the Grub menu. But if I boot into Windows and restart, then I go straight back into Windows. When this happens I immediately check the BIOS and find that all settings are the same as I left them except the boot order has been rearranged as previously mentioned. \nCan anyone explain why this happens or how to stop it? I tried changing the \"default operating system\" through windows control panel but, of course, only Windows is recognized and listed as an option.

I only know the bits and pieces I've introduced myself to as need be.\nThank you all for your time and assistance in this matter.\n\nA: The cause of your issue could be that you are booting the EFI default bootloader of the harddrive instead of the Windows bootloader (NVRAM entry named Windows Boot Manager), which usually \"corrects\" the boot order. Just use the Windows bootloader in that case, alternatively you could replace the default bootloader with another one.\n\nA: Have you turned off secure boot in boot menu?.That might be the problem.Also turn off the fast start up from control panel.\n\nA: Tim - Are you asking how to change secure boot and fast start up? For fast start up: Go to your control panel and open the \"Power Options\" folder. You should have a selection on the left that says \"choose what the power button does\". Click this option. On the next screen you should see an option near the bottom that says \"Turn on fast startup (recommended)\". If you want to turn it off, obviously just uncheck the box. If you cannot uncheck it then look for an option on that page that says \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\". Clicking this option should make the fast startup option changeable.\nAs for the secure boot: Hold down \"shift\" while restarting the computer. A menu screen will open. Click \"Troubleshoot\" > \"Advanced Options\" > \"UEFI Firmware Settings\". It should restart into your BIOS menu. The arrangement of your BIOS options will depend on your system but it should be pretty easy to find \"Secure Boot\" and disable it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 crashes on resuming from suspend Scenario.\nI recently uninstalled Nvidia propitiatory drivers, and installed nouveau ones.\nBefore that, sleep and resume worked fine.

I would recommend either installing using the NVM too, which won't require you to use sudo to install packages through npm, or install from a PPA.\nBoth of these options will include NPM, so you'll be ready for the next step.\nGenerating an app with Express\nGet the generator\nIf you want to use Express from the command line to generate an app, you'll need to run npm install -g express-generator.  Note that the tool is called express-generator, not express. And if you installed Node from the PPA, you'll need to add a sudo before the npm install command.\nMake a directory\nCreate a directory for you project:\nmkdir ~/MyWebApp\n\nAnd change into that directory\ncd ~/MyWebApp\n\nGenerate\nOnce inside that directory, you can run the express generator from the command line:\nexpress\n\nYou can also create the directory and generate the app in one step:\nexpress MyWebApp\n\nRunning the above will automatically create a MyWebApp folder inside of whatever directory you are currently in, and it will generate the express app there.\n", "Q: Can I use a Bash variable in a sed command?

Use double-quotes\n... | sed \"$ip\" ...\n\nThis has certain implications. It doesn't apply here but you might have to escape things you wouldn't need to in single-quote-marks.\nBut I'd also consider rewriting that so you're not running the same commands n times to print the first n lines (which is what this does). Here are some alternatives...\nUsing head:\nmaas maas nodes list | grep hostname | cut -d\\\" -f4 | head -5\n\nStoring the command output:\noutput=$(maas maas nodes list | grep hostname | cut -d\\\" -f4)\nfor i in 1 2 3 4 5; do\n    sed -n \"$ip\"\ndone\n\nCreating a better sed string:\nmaas maas nodes list | grep hostname | cut -d\\\" -f4 | sed -n $(printf \"%dp;\" {1..5})\n\nRoll all your search/trim code into one awk:\nmaas maas nodes list | awk -F'\"' '/hostname/ && i<5 {i++; print $4}'\n\nI'm an awk fetishist so I'd probably go for the last.\n", "Q: \"invoke-rc.d: initscript freeradius, action \"force-reload\" failed.\" while configure freeradious-mysql I am installing freeradius-mysql.\nIt Just give me an error.\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n   freeradius-mysql\n\nI tried so many articles but they couldn't help me.

If I remove my network cable and restart the system it is coming but again when I connect the LAN cable and use su or sudo\nterminal is getting hanged and nothing is coming what might be the cause of this problem.\nSo I decided to recover it using the recovery mode(like system restore in windows) I have not created or mounted anything.\nwill it solve my problem or what the recovery mode do in ubuntu I mean what is the use of recovery mode in Ubuntu.  \n\nA: \nIf your system fails to boot for whatever reason, it may be useful to boot it into recovery mode. This mode just loads some basic services and drops you into command line mode. You are then logged in as root (the superuser) and can repair your system using command line tools. \n\nFor more information as to what you can and can't do from recovery mode, consult the following document:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode\n", "Q: NodeJS install issues Whenever I need to use NodeJS I'm always tired of a bunch of problems.\nAt the moment I need to use closurecompiler nodejs module and try to install it and nodejs.

In one step you can only enlarge a partition when unallocated space goes right after a partition. Bout you can do in multiple steps: moving partitions boundaries from right to left one by one.

So I copied some wallpapers to /usr/share/backgrounds. But the wallpaper changer (All settings --> Appearance --> Look) does not show the new images that I copied. What am I missing?\n\nA: You need to edit /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/trusty-wallpapers.xml,  which is a real pain, especially with lots of long file names. \nIt's easier to leave the pictures in the Pictures folder and direct Appearance to that with the drop down menu (set on Wallpapers by default). \nI don't know if you can create a sub folder in Pictures that Appearance can access.\n\nA: I think. A cause It's due to Permissions. Strangely, sometimes the Wallpapers are saved without permissions to group and others on User profile folder or Partition Data.\nSupposedly, the wallpapers need \"Read permissions\" to they, it being /usr/share/backgrounds/ a Root folder.\nFrom Terminal inside --> /usr/share/backgrounds/<My-personal-wallpapers-using>, become as root I use the command:\nsudo chmod 0644 * « or » sudo chmod go+r *\nOr maybe, fix the permissions from Origin folder before to copying.\nThen, so those NEW wallpapers pasted to destiny, now they are displayed from the GUI Changer Wallpapers.\nFor all wallpaper images the permissions must be displayed as: -rw-r--r--\n", "Q: There is a file in ~/.cache/deja-dup/.. with 899G size I am running my mail server on ubuntu which has 1.2 TB in total space. \nToday I realized there was an issue on my mail server, it was refusing sending/receiving mails due to storage which triggers port issues too.\nFirst I removed my latest backup which I shouldn't have done.., then started to investigate real problem;\n********@***:~/.cache/deja-dup/8f323f............/duplicity-full-signatures.20140724T223328Z.sigtar.part\n\n-rw------ 1 ******* ******** 899G Aug 5 10:02 duplicity-full-signatures.20140724T223328Z.sigtar.part\n\nWhat is that file used for? \nIs it safe to remove it because the size is really really really huge.. 899G..\n\n\nA: This is a known bug/feature.

installed Adobe flashplugin-installer 11.2.202.378ubuntu0.12.04.1 from the Ubuntu Software Centre in my computer bt still I cannot watch videos online.What could be the issue. Can somebody propose a remedy ?Thanks folks.\n\nA: Be more precise when asking questions. I have to assume you use Firefox and \"can't watch videos\" means you still get \"No flash installed\" error. Close yor browser. Then open Terminal and do \nsudo apt-get purge flashplugin-installer\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\nRead carefully the output - it has to download files from Internet during installation, and if it fails, it installs no flash but reports everything is OK. \n", "Q: How do you get C++ to compile from Code::BLocks? (Beginner to Linux) So I just recently installed Linux after using Windows for my whole life. I also just installed the C++ IDE named code::blocks using the following command in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install codeblocks\n\nNow whenever I try to run some source code I get this error\nsh:1 /home/daniel/Desktop/Hey: Permission Denied\n\nAny help/solution? \n\nA: The normal behaviour of CodeBlocks when working on a single file (as opposed to a project) is to use the name of the file without any extension as the name of the compiled executable. So hello.cpp will produce a binary named hello. CodeBlocks checks the timestamps of the files to see whether compilation is needed. This breaks when the file doesn't have an extension: a source file named hello would have a binary file named hello from CodeBlocks' point-of-view. So timestamp checking fails, since it is comparing the file to itself. Hence CodeBlocks doesn't compile the code, and instead tries to run it directly, where it fails because the source file is not an executable. (This won't be a problem for executable source code like shell scripts.)\nSo always save C/C++ source code with an appropriate extension when using CodeBlocks (and in general, as well).\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu Be faster In Gnome I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on My old Pc Having\n2GB Ram\nPentium 4 Processor 3.04Ghz\n6GB Swap\nBut still it works very slow like Hell.\nIf I install Gnome Classic Then It will Be fast Or Not?\n\nA: I assume you want to compare with the Unity desktop? Changing to Gnome Classic will improve it a little. If you want to have a lightweight desktop environment, I suggest trying Xfce (http://www.xfce.org/). This is the default desktop environment for the Xubuntu releases.\nYou can install it on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nfor Ubuntu branding or \nthe original Xfce desktop:\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\n(Source: How can I install XFCE along side unity?)\n\nA: Probably yes. But CPU and RAM has nothing to do with it. Unity is expecting 3D to work very good, and I suppose you have some video card without supported 3D. Anyway, instead of Gnome you should better step forward and try Xfce. You will have more features for less resources, without compositing window manager. Consider this. \n\nA: sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\nthen you will probably find something interesting in compiz, like Static Application Switcher, if needed:\nsudo apt-get install ccsm\nsudo apt-get install  compiz-plugins-extra\nccsm\n", "Q: Hibernation error - Could not write byte: broken pipe Suddenly, right after \"turning on\" my ubuntu 12.04 from hibernation, there was an error\n\nCould not write bytes:broken pipes\n\nwhich led to a black screen so I had to reboot.

Can I assign a keyboard shortcut with a similar property in Lubuntu (i.e. in LXDE)?\nMore precisely, can I set up a shortcut such that if the application is already opened then focus will switch to it and the workspace will change accordingly (like in Unity)? So far I have only managed to assign a shortcut that launches (a new instance of) the application.\n\nA: Openbox (LXDE's window manager) doesn't have an inbuilt functionality for this, but with a little help from xdotool we can write a script that can replicate and even enhance Unity's behaviour.\nFirst, make sure you have xdotool installed:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nSave the following script as focus_or_launch and make it executable:\n #!/bin/bash\n\n# NAME:         focus_or_launch\n# VERSION:      0.4\n# AUTHOR:       (c) 2014 Glutanimate <https://github.com/Glutanimate/>\n#\n# DESCRIPTION:  Focus existing app window or launch application if no\n#               window found\n#\n#               Simplified version of a script by Henning Bekel\n#               (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=625009#p625009)\n#\n# DEPENDENCIES: xdotool\n#\n# LICENSE:      GNU GPLv3 (http://www.gnu.de/documents/gpl-3.0.en.html)\n#\n# NOTICE:       THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. \n#               EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES \n#               PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR \n#               IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY \n#               AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If no instance is found the script will launch a new one.\nTo integrate this script with your desktop session edit your openbox configuration file (e.g. ~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml, ../lubuntu-rc.xml or ../rc.xml) and add a section similar to the following for each application you want to control:\n<keybind key=\"W-g\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>focus_or_launch gedit</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n\nMake sure to replace focus_or_launch with the path to the script on your system or,  alternatively, copy the script to your $PATH.\nIf you don't want the script to launch a new app instance, simply remove the following section:\n\"$Executable\" > /dev/null 2>&1 &\ndisown\n\nP.S.: This script should work on all xdotool-compatible desktop environments (e.g. Unity, GNOME, XFCE...)\n", "Q: Nvidia (Bumblebee) failed to load after install latest Intel driver Everything was just fine. I have updated Intel driver using this installer. After installing the driver it was asked to restart and I did. Now optirun is not working. Intel driver looks good I think. I run dpkg-reconfigure for bumblebee, bbswitch-dkms and nvidia-340 but nothings helps. Also restart the system couple of times.

After upgrading from Ubuntu 13.04 to 14.04 the system printing dialog shows printers I never installed:\n\n\"Farblaser\" and \"Laser\" are printers I installed, the other two show up out of nowhere. Neither the CUPS web interface nor system-config-printer shows them, even with View/Discovered Printers enabled. Browsing Off is already in the CUPS config file. Printing dialogs other than the system one, e.g. Libreoffice (sic), don't show them either.\nAs it turns out, these are two network printers in our LAN. I can send print jobs to them, even though printing a PDF from evince results in the the PDF binary being printed -- ouch.\nFollowing this answer, it's clear where the printer names come from; avahi-browse -a | grep Printer finds our network printers and assigns them IDs of the form [BDxxxx] which match the printer names (which I partly blurred out).\nDisabling a whole service with multiple uses seems like overkill. How can I disable this behaviour of the printing dialog?\n\nA: As stopping the avahi-daemonor inserting enable-dbus=nointo the avahi-daemon.conf did not help (16.04), we disabled the daemon on the interface which points to the network where the printers reside by adding deny-interfaces=<interface>to the [server] section of the config-file.\nWe could only do it because we do not need any avahi functionality there. \n", "Q: MATLAB R2014a on Ubuntu 12.04 Installation issue (BadMatch.

Not so in my case.\nThe problem I am experiencing is this. When testing the Suspend, everything works as expected. Computer enters sleep and I can resume from USB. But testing is usually for a short duration. When I leave the Computer in sleep for any length of time (shortest I've noticed but may be less is 1 hour) it will not wake up or power up. I do notice the LED on my case fan flash once, but other than that there is nothing. So, of course, there are no error logs.\nIn addition to this, the reset button does not work neither does holding the power button. I have to physically cut the power, after which I can do a normal reboot.\nI'm on a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04, with a Radeon HD6790 graphics card. Thinking it may be related to the graphics card I've tried both the Catalyst v.12 and the beta v.14.\nAll I can think is that it must be some setting used to enter Suspend which is causing the problem.\nCan anybody suggest a way to remedy the problem or something else I can try?\n\nA: This is a bug and should be reported it on Launchpad. You will then be asked to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update all of your packages (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade)\n\n*Upgrade your BIOS if an upgrade is available.\n\n*Try the very latest mainline kernel to verify the bug has not already been fixed.\n\n*Follow the instructions at DebuggingKernelSuspend and Kernel Documentation: Debugging hibernation and suspend\nEven if the bug is fixed in later mainline Linux kernels, it is still important to report the issue on Launchpad to ensure that the bug gets fixed in the Ubuntu kernel.\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu Linux 14.04 to recognize my Kindle Fire HD? I already tried gmtp. It doesn't see the device.\nI also tried the longer route at itsfoss.com. That method didn't work, either, possibly because 14.04 didn't recognize a couple of the commands.

Which one is the faster and will I get all the features of Ubuntu on them? I've done a little homework too on it, I think xfce will be the better option. My pc specs aren't good enough to handle Unity, as it hangs very often. \n\nA: With my experiences, Xfce (or Xubuntu), as an older DE, is more polished, provides more  \"built-in\" features, has nicer artwork, and a larger community.\nLXDE (or Lubuntu) on the other hand is a newer DE, not that polished as Xfce, it takes several apps from Ubuntu and Xubuntu instead of having it's own equivalent (for example notifications, power manager, disk manager, and window manager (Openbox)). But Lubuntu is much faster than Xubuntu, mainly because it uses lighter applications and hasn't got all the eye-candy (effects, shadows, compositoning).\nThey both are full-featured. If you are installing Linux on someone elses hardware (friend, parents), who are new to Linux, go with Xubuntu. It's more user friendly, and has a nice settings center. However, if you are installing it on your own hardware, try Lubuntu. Not as nice (although you can fix that), needs a little tinkering, but the speed will fascinate you.\nI am was on Lubuntu (actually GNOME on Arch now, hehe), mainly because of the speed, but I just installed Xubuntu into my cousin's computer yesterday, who hasn't seen a Linux yet, because it's easier to operate.\nPlease note that I was talking about Lubuntu 14.04.1 and Xubuntu 14.04.1.\nHowever, with 15.04 (maybe 14.10 but that's unlikely) They still haven't swapped it but it looks like the plans are after 16.04, Lubuntu will swap the now abandoned LXDE with LXQt, on which 2 teams (LXDE and RazorQt teams) will be working on, and will get much more polish and be more like Xfce, and Xfce will be ported to Gtk3, which is not exactly lightweight, so the difference will be much larger between Lubuntu and Xubuntu.\n\nA: Which one is faster?\nObviously LXDE. It is even lighter than XFCE. LXDE uses about 110 mb of ram when idle while XFCE is a little more bloated, taking about 200 mb (based on my experience)\nWhich is easier to use?\nXFCE. It have more GUIs while LXDE requires you to modify configuration files in your own in some cases. \nMore configurable?\nBoth are configurable, but it depends on how much you want to play with it. It is less configurable than KDE or GNOME, though.\nCan I install them?\nVia the software center everything is easier. But I recommend you use lubuntu-desktop for LXDE or xubntu-desktop for XFCE.

I've not been able to get it working either. \nAnyway, I managed to share my ethernet network connection via WiFi to other devices using this method: \n\n\n*\n\n*Click on network-manager and then on 'Edit Connections'\n\n*Create a new WiFi connection and give it an SSID, e.g. WiFi Hotspot. \n\n*Switch to the 'Wi-Fi Security' tab, choose WPA & WPA2 Personal, and give your hotspot a password. \n\n*Switch to the IPv4 tab and change the method to 'Shared to other computers' option. \n\n*Save and close the connection settings window, and try connecting to your hotspot on your other device(s).

Its screen resolution is still really low.\nDespite that, I cannot watch any kind of video as computer becomes overloaded is not able to play the video normally.\nI am currently using UBUNTU 14.04.\nCan anyone help me to solve the problems or does anybody know which version of Ubuntu works fine with this computer?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I've just finished loading Ubuntu onto a Dell fx160 thin client that has the SiS 771/617 video adapter as standard. I originally loaded 16.04 and it acted like a dog, you could see the interlacing and the whole system was slooow.\nLooking through Xorg.0.log I noticed that the Sis driver native in Xorg wasn't rated for the 771/617, and the only driver I could find for the 771/671 was noted here: https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/sis\nOne developed by Antonio J. de Oliveira, most of whose work is now missing from the internet. Pity, coz he's the only guy who seemed to do much with the SiS cards. And maybe due to the age of his driver, it was compiled against the kernel used in Ubuntu 12.04.1. (note the ver 1.  I loaded 12.04.4 which I had handy, and it didn't work. I had to go back in Ubuntu archives and get v1).\nBunged sis671_drv.so into /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers edited xorg.conf so that Section Device had sis671 as driver and fired it up.\nNo problems! and plenty of resolutions to choose from in display settings.\nFor some reason settings can't detect the monitor and insists on calling it a laptop, and I cannot get dual monitors to work. They did work as desktop in one test iteration, so it can be done, but the two monitors were different resolutions and I couldn't find the way to alter them independently. The larger monitor, on dvi, wasn't lined up properly and it's resolution was awry. I tried a virtual monitor definition in xorg.conf, but that just made it lock up and I'd have to go back to root cli to rename xorg.conf so that it would start on defaults not conf.\nThe fx160 has a vga and a dvi on the one SiS card. In the end, I had to put the main monitor on the vga output. I don't know if sis671_drv has the functionality for dvi or dual monitors. I know it makes the xorg log ten times normal length, so there's a lot going on in there. After all the driver is over 500kb.\nIf anyone gets dual head on a Ubuntu FX160 I'd be interested to hear.\n\nA: There is no currently supported version of Ubuntu which supports SiS 671/771 cards (this is bug #301958). Your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use an obsolete unsupported version of Ubuntu and never update. Not really recommended since you will not get security updates, but if you want to try it then 12.04.2 has been reported to work.\n\n*Try Linux Mint 13. There have been reports that it contains some older modified SiS driver that works.\n\n*Give up and buy a laptop with supported graphics. An old Thinkpad with ATI graphics can be bought for $50 on Ebay and it will run Xubuntu/Lubuntu well.\n\n*If you are a developer, you can fix the source. The issue has been brought up on the Xorg mailing list, and an Xorg developer responded (1 2)\n\nIf those still don't work, get your hands dirty... if any particular\n  strings appear in error messages, find those strings in the source and\n  figure out what function is failing. Then compare the execution of the\n  broken copy to the last working copy you remembered. If the API of\n  some dependency changed, use git bisect to repeatedly compile the\n  kernel or the Xserver until you find the exact line of code in the\n  dependency that made the difference. Hacking the driver might sound\n  hard, but it's not so hard that you have to pay someone to do it.\nThe problem here is not that some gigantic reverse engineering effort\n  is needed. The problem is that a few tiny janatorial fixes were\n  required. And it's easy to miss one when the developer implementing\n  the fixes doesn't have a SiS card on which to test.\n\nBasically nobody knows what the actual problem is, so someone with the affected hardware needs to git-bisect the Xorg driver source and figure out how it got broken.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to enable 3D acceleration with Sis Vga 771/671 on Ubuntu 12.04\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 screen resolution too low (SiS 671 graphics card)\n\n*How to install SiS 671/771 Video Drivers in ubuntu?\n\n*How to install SiS 771/671 video drivers on 13.10?\n\nA: I recently refurbished a Fujitsu-Siemens Esprimo Mobile v5535 laptop (specs here: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Fujitsu-Siemens-Esprimo-Mobile-V5535.9149.0.html) which sports a SiS Mirage 3+ 672MX graphics chip.\nThe goal was to install a newish 18.04 or 18.10 32-bit variant of Ubuntu (Lubuntu to be exact).

Similarly group names are mapped to GIDs from /etc/group. The IDs are decided as and when they are required. 0 is always root but almost everything else is decided when the user and groups are created.\nThese *IDs are near-arbitrary integers that the system interprets as defined users and groups. The IDs are decided as and when they are required. 0 is always root but almost everything else is decided when the user and groups are created.\nWhen a file is written to disk, it is these UID and GID values that are stored on disk, not the string representation. And that's what is happening here. Your user→UID and group→GID mappings in  on your secondary install don't line up with the UIDs from your first install. It's mapping file ownership to the wrong users.\nIf your old install is never going to be a factor in this, I would simply just remap the ownership to the mysql user:\nsudo chown --recursive mysql: /var/lib/mysql\n\nI've checked a real-world MySQL install and all the files in my /var/lib/mysql were owned by mysql:mysql so I think this should be accurate.\n\nIf the old install will be used again (eg a dual-boot-style arrangement) you'll need to be more creative.

Microsoft is making it impossible for older skype versions to function.\n\nA: I upgraded to version 4.3.0.37 because version 4.2.0.13 was not allowing me to login anymore with the error “Can’t connect”.\nUnfortunately for me after hours of trying I could not get pulseaudio to work on my system and as ALSA support is dropped in 4.3.0.37 I downgraded back to 4.2.0.13\nTo solve the login error I spoofed the version number 4.2.0.13 to the latest 4.3.0.37 version and login was working again, problem solved.\nSo to solve any problems simply install 4.2.0.13 and spoof to 4.3.0.37 version, exit Skype and run this command:\nsudo sed -i ‘s/\\x34\\x2E\\x32\\x2E\\x30\\x2E\\x31\\x33/\\x34\\x2E\\x33\\x2E\\x30\\x2E\\x33\\x37/g’ /usr/bin/skype\n\nA: rm -r ~/.Skype worked for me with ubuntu 13/ skype 4.3\n\nA: I also did everything as it was said above. I removed a previous version 4.2.0.11 of Skype in the terminal by typing:\nsudo apt-get remove skype\napt-get autoremove\nThen I installed the downloaded package skype-ubuntu-lucid_4.3.0.37-1_i386.deb from the site http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-linux/ for my Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx using \"Gdebi Package Installer\".

And so I did.\nDuring the upgrade I saw there was some problems with the openafs-client. After restarting the puter openafs-client didn't work. After rebooting on the previous version openafs-client works, but what should I do to get it working on the latest kernel 3.13.0-32?\nSome facts:\nuname -a :\nLinux RD0022805 3.13.0-32-generic #57~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 03:50:54 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\nMessage when I do service openafs-client start:\n*AFS module /lib/modules/3.13.0-32-generic/fs/openafs.ko does not exist.\nNot starting AFS.  Please consider building kernel modules using\ninstructions in /usr/share/doc/openafs-client/README.modules*\n\nMaybe I only have to get the missing lib module to get it working?\nIf so, how do I do that?\n\nA: I solved this problem by installing the openafs PPA from https://launchpad.net/~openafs/+archive/ubuntu/stable and starting openafs:\nsudo /etc/init.d/openafs-client start\n", "Q: iTunes on PlayOnLinux doesn't appear in search I can't find the iTunes on PlayOnLinux search, it just doesn't appear.\nIs there other way I could install it?\n\nA: ITunes is one of those pieces of software which does not run in Linux.  You could try to use PoL (although you have already discovered it does not work) or you could try Wine, although it is also not supported there.\nThe only workable solution that I found was to run Windows in a virtual machine, and run ITunes there.  My experience with VirtualBox was that ITunes will run in WinXP and Win7, but not fully in Win8.  VMWare Player is able to support ITunes in Win8, mostly, but I have some problems with older Ipods in Win8/VMWare, and generally stick to Win7/VMWare at this time.\nIt you decide to use VirtualBox, you will need to capture the USB connection of the IPad/Pod/Phone device using the USB filter capability of VirtualBox.  It takes a little playing around, but can be done.\n", "Q: Can I trust repositories How can I trust any Repositories  like \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:upubuntu-com/tor\nor\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:wagungs/Kali-linux\n\nA: You can trust them as much as you trust the people who put them up. Anyone can put up a PPA; a repository owned by some random user is obviously less trustworthy than the official LibreOffice PPA, for example.\n\nA: Good question. The short answer is: you can't trust them.\n", "Q: Cannot remove file from trash that was put there as root I know about the dangers of using root access so please forego the lectures. I try to be careful and will be doubly so from now on.\nI was using the file browser with root access in order to change some file permissions. During the process I deleted some files (I should say that I out them in the trash). Little did I know that the files would go to the trash as root and now I can't remove them because I don't have the permission to read them but I don't know how to access them to change the permissions because I don't know how to get into the trash as root. All I get is a message saying that:\n\nThis location could not be displayed.\nSorry, could not display all the contents of trash:///: Operation not supported\n\nI have searched around to try to find posts about it but I've only found outdated information about a hidden file in the root directory. That doesn't seem to apply any more so I'm stuck with a file in my trash that I can't remove and can't gain access to.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 64bit on an ASUS x401a laptop.\n\nA: run this in your cmd\nsudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*\n\n\nA: You will need root access to the trash to be able to delete these files - the easiest way to do this in a temporary sense, is to open a terminal window alt+ctrl+t, and enter the command\ngksudo nautilus /home/your_username/.local/share/Trash\nThis will execute the file manager with super-user permissions and you should be able to empty the trash from here. Delete the root-owned file.\nWhen you are done, remember to close the program!\n\nA: If you would like to delete all of the contents of the trash you could use sudo and remove the entire directory.  Remember to remake the directory so it doesn't cause any problems.  The code is:\nsudo rm -rf /home/User_Name/.local/share/Trash && mkdir /home/User_Name/.local/share/Trash\n\nThat will do it all with one entry into the terminal.\n\nA: I personally use trash-cli a lot. I use it as an alternative to rm to be safe (e.g. trash -r my-folder).\nsudo apt install trash-cli\n\nOnce installed you can do\nsudo trash-empty\n\n\nA: Use the terminal!1eleven (drag and drop)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+t.\n\n*To take ownership of the files again and continue in your filemanager, type the command sudo chown -R $USER:$USER and make sure there is a space at the end.\n\n*Now drag the the affected file or folder from your filemanager to the terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*The result should look like this:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER '/home/$USER/.local/share/Trash/files/some_file.txt'\n\nor this:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER '/media/$USER/path to external drive/.Trash-1000/files/sömё fïle thät may have fancy encodings, ſpaces & stuf.txt'\n\nwhere $USER stands for your user name in the path name.\n\n\n*Run the command by pressing Enter and probably refresh the view with F5 in the filemanager.\n\n*As noted by David Foerster, you can replace the apostrophes with quotation marks, to have shell variable expansion.\n\n\nUsing the terminal with files isn't that difficult when drag and drop works, is it? ^^ It is a very handy feature when you know how to use it.\nAlternatively you can delete single files with rm. Deleting folders can be done with rmdir for empty folders or rm -r for deleting files and folders recursively. While the drag and drop method should work in almost all cases and properly escape everything you should still be careful when using deletion commands. Owning the files and deleting them in your filemanager is the safer solution.\nRelated\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I empty the trash using terminal?\n\nA: TL;DR: install trash-cli and execute:\nsudo HOME=/home/<your-home-dir> trash-empty\n\nWhy are the other solutions wrong? They fall into two categories:\n\n*\n\n*Delete everything in the trash folder\n\n*Run a command that actually does something different than the OP asked\n\nSolutions of type 1 are wrong because the trash folder has structure that should not be modified directly. Whatever manages it keeps a small database there. If you delete that database, you risk breaking the trash functionality altogether. This may not be the case at this time, but may become the case at any point in the future.\nThe type 2 solution is sudo trash-empty, which empties root's trash instead of \"your\" trash. Without sudo, it would run into the original issue.\n", "Q: 403 Error on Virtual Host on LAMP stack I've installed lamp stack and trying to set it up using the instructions on \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP\nI want to be able to work in a directory other than \"var/www/\" so i thought i could set up a virtual host for this as suggested in the link but i can't seem to get it to work. I'm using apache 2.4.7.\nThe thing is, i can't find the step 4. the link i gave under Virtual Hosts. So i've edited /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and added a directory tag as;\n<Directory /home/kemallin/Dropbox/www/>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nI've disabled the default site and enabled my newly created site conf with;\n sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf && sudo a2ensite editor.conf\n\nbut when try htpp://localhost/ it gives me this error :\nForbidden\n\nYou don't have permission to access / on this server.\n\nApache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) Server at localhost Port 80\n\ni also tried to change \n<Directory />\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require all denied\n</Directory>\n\nto require all granted restarted the apache service and still its giving me the same 403 forbidden error.\nAny pointers on this one? \nThanks.\n\nA: Firstly, remove the following from apache.conf and put it in editor.conf (it's just  good practice). When compiled, the location won't make a difference to the Virtual Host editor.\n<Directory /home/kemallin/Dropbox/www/>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>  \n\nNow execute the following:\n$ sudo -i\n# chmod +x /home\n# chmod +x /home/kemallin\n# chmod +x /home/kemallin/Dropbox/\n# chmod -R 755 /home/kemallin/Dropbox/www/\n# a2ensite editor.conf\n# service apache2 reload\n\nYou are basically giving apache permission to list all files in the tree /home/kemallin/Dropbox/ and then permissions to read files from the folder you want to serve files from.\n", "Q: How to install Hydra 8 on Ubuntu?

The toggle in the bluetooth settings won't turn on at all. \n\nA: First, check out if you have the Bluetooth LKM (Linux Kernel Module) enabled.\nsudo lsmod | grep bluetooth\n\nIf you don't, try this.\nsudo insmod bluetooth\n\nIf this fails,  you'll have to recompile your kernel to add Bluetooth support (unlikely, since Ubuntu has a rather good hardware detection). If th bluetooth LKM successfully loads, try troubleshooting the issue with bluetoothctl\nsudo apt-get install bluez\n\nThen\n[bluetooth]# list\n[Controllers list]\n[bluetooth]# select [controller]\n[bluetooth]# devices\n\nThat should give you a base for troubleshooting.

I burned the latest Ubuntu 14.04 image to a DVD from my Macbook Pro.  I booted off the DVD and pushed a key when the keyboard/person image came up to show the boot menu, and then selected Install Ubuntu from the menu.  From there the screen just goes black and never shows anything else.  For reference, here's my hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*ASUS Z97-Deluxe \n\n*Intel Core i7 4.0 GHZ \n\n*32GB GSkill DDR3 2400 \n\n*ASUS GTX 770\n\n\nI'm actually running 2x GTX 770 in SLI, but I took one out to troubleshoot.  Things that I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Waiting\n\n*Removing one of the video cards\n\n*Plugging the monitor into different outputs\n\n*Disabling Secure Boot\nThanks in advance for any help that you're able to offer, I would love to get this thing up and running ASAP!\n\nA: After hours of troubleshooting, I figured out the issue.  It turns out that the video issues were a bit of a red herring, but I'll start by explaining how they were obfuscating the problem and how to get around that.  It turns out that Ubuntu was hanging during startup, and I couldn't see why.  To get around that I pushed enter during boot (while the keyboard + person was on screen) to bring up the boot menu, pressed F6 to edit boot options, then manually replaced \"quiet splash\" with \"nomodeset\", and then launched Ubuntu from disk.  That allowed me to read the startup output and see what was going on.\nIt turns out that the ASUS z97-Deluxe has 10 SATA ports on two connectors that are controlled by two separate controllers.  The top 4 ports on the A set of connectors and the two ports closest to the board on the B set of connectors are controlled by the Intel controller, and the remaining ports are controlled by the ASMedia controller.  The ASMedia controlled ports can apparently be used for disk drives only and I had an ATAPI DVD drive hooked up to one of them, which was causing Ubuntu to hang.  It's a really confusing configuration and one that I'm sure will cause others trouble as well, so hopefully they manage to find this post (or get amazing help on IRC at #Ubuntu like I did, can't thank those folks enough!).\n\nA: Please read this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132\n... at How to enable kernel options on the livecd (before install)\nYou need to TRY adding  nouveau.blacklist=1 to the END OF the linux /boot ...  line.  \nNOTE: I am NOT sure this will help, I have not tried it. \nBut generally having a Nvidia GPU means that the nouveau display driver tries to step in - which creates the black display.\n(The nouveau driver is included in the kernel as far as I know) \n\nA: Adding nomodeset solved my problem. I have GTX 980 and ASUS x99. The screen flashes ACPI PCC probe failed and goes dead.\nThe following fixed my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot with UEFI\n\n*when seeing the Try Ubuntu... press \"e\"\n\n*add nomodeset after splash (before the \"--\")\n\n\nI tried \"acpi=off\" and \"acpi=ht\" but none of them worked for me.\nAfter installation. The installed system crashes also so it needs pressing \"e\" and adding nomodeset as well. The way to fix is to add nomodeset to /etc/default/grub according to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132, and sudo update-grub afterwards.\n", "Q: Can percona-cluster be used with LXC Can percona-cluster charm be safely placed in anto LXC containers?

Before starting, please be familar with the charm README as you will need to follow it closely, and as it is changing very frequently, I don't feel it would be best to type it all out here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://manage.jujucharms.com/~openstack-charmers/precise/percona-cluster\nYou can target each unit to an LXC in turn with the --to parameter, as follows:\n# Instead of deploying to a machine, use --to lxc:0\njuju deploy --config percona.yaml percona-cluster --to lxc:0\n\n# wait till new unit is 'started', then:\njuju add-unit percona-cluster --to lxc:0\n\n# wait till new unit is 'started', then:\njuju add-unit percona-cluster --to lxc:0\n\nKeep in mind that as of this writing, LXCs are not externally network addressable outside their host machine except on the MAAS provider, so you will need to have them all on the same piece of hardware (and whatever is using them on the same hardware as well).

BACKGROUND:\nOnce upon a time, when I installed Ubuntu 10.x on an older machine, and kept upgrading it until 13.04 or 13.10, there was an easy-to-find option in Settings that allowed to install NVidia's proprietary drivers and keep them up to date (or not, because sometimes they released a new version with a bunch of awful regressions).\nNow, when I installed 13.10 on my new laptop, which I then upgraded to 14.04, I haven't ever been able to find that option anywhere.\nAn attempt to install nvidia drivers with apt-get dont-remember-what resulted in a screwed up system that wouldn't properly start Unity (or even xorg, not sure), roughly equivalent to an unbootable system. But I managed to revert that.\nI seem to understand that there are some sort of opensource drivers called \"nouveau\" that come by default in Ubuntu which kind of provide an alternative to NVidia's proprietary drivers. Is that so? \nTHE PRACTICAL QUESTIONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it ok to not install NVidia's drivers, or am I underutilizing the potential of the GPU (i.e. not using all the available hardware acceleration)? Or in other words:\nis there a test I can run to check whether hardware acceleration of my GPU is being properly used with my current setup (nouveau or whatever it is)?\n\n*What's the proper recommended way to install NVidia proprietary drivers now on Ubuntu 14.04, without bricking the system?\n\nA: You simply need to open the setting menu for ubuntu, Click \"Software & Updates\".\nSelect the far right tab \"Additional Drivers\" and wait a few seconds for Ubuntu to build a list of drivers you can use. \nIt should looks something like this: \nNote: you may see different drivers than me.\nMake sure to pick the one that has the message (proprietary, Tested) next to it.\nOnce Selected click \"Apply Changes\" let it do its thing and reboot.\nThis is the safest way I have found to do this without my system losing X11 after an update or upgrade. Some Desktop environments perform better under the opensource driver while others you can see little difference. I have noticed with unity on ubuntu that the minimize animation can sometimes show some artifacts while using the Nvidia Driver, but other than that it performs much better in all other respects. \n", "Q: How to install for the person that can't make sense of the how to page So I am trying to figure out how to use Ubuntu for the first time.

I have looked at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nThe ubuntu file is an ISO so those instructions defie my sense of logic. To be clear I did burn it to a disc to see if I could find the \"start up disc creator\". The answer is no that isn't on the ISO. \nMind you that I do not want to overlay Ubuntu onto windows. I don't want it side load or sharing the same disc as windows. I want to install it to its own disc to be the native OS for that disc. The ISO seems to be an installer for windows. \nI will be using windows of course to make the usb install drive. That is as much relationship as I want the two to have though. \nThanks for the help in advance. \n\nA: You have tried to make a bootable DVD/CD? On Windows you just download the .iso file and click 'burn'. You should check the 'verify disk' option if it asks for it. I have installed Ubuntu on 7 different computers, and in my experience I have found disks to me infinitely  more reliable then USB sticks/drives.\n\nA: you need to use this Windows based Tool for creating your USB bootable drive:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nmake sure you backup all data on the usb drive because this will erase any data on it.\nOnce the USB drive is created and you reboot you system and the installer starts you will be asked if you want to replace windows or install along side windows so make sure to pick install alongside. the Installer will then continue on to let you re partition your drive example: if you have a 500GB Hard disk you can give 250GB to windows and the other 250GB to Ubuntu. \n", "Q: Updated Intel display driver causing errors when booting I upgraded to to Graphics Installer 1.0.6 on my Ubuntu 14.04 and installed the drivers using the Intel Graphics Installer.

If this is the case you can back up your data from there, then wipe the drive in it entirety.\nSecond, the partitions are possibly not mounting because you were in the middle of writing something, Windows is retarded the same way when a CD is removed, all user interaction is prompted to put the CD in or else.  So simply putting the harddrive back in would work, but only if you still had the machine running.  Some cases, however, can revert last made changes.  \nThird, your partition table file, for the name I cannot recall, is most likely destroyed and corrupted.\nFourth, you should never, ever ever ever ever, remove a drive while its in use, ever.\nIf the first three cannot fix your issue, then back what data you can and call in a pro to recover the \"Lost\" data you cannot.  Sadly HDD problems are mostly irreversible and permanent, with no work around possible without ruining the drive or its contents further.

Excellent.\n\n\nUPDATE\nIt turns out the above is not good enough. Although it installs ipython, it doesn't install it in the virtualenv--there's no ipython directory created in /opt/jenv/bin at all. When installed in this way, in my environment, anyway, starting IPython uses Python 2.7, not 3.4. (that's what it says when it starts up).\nThe solution is to activate the virtualenv and then install with the virtualenv's pip:\nsudo /opt/jenv/bin/pip install ipython\n\n(A reminder that without sudo, this doesn't work--see the question.) IPython is now correctly installed in the bin directory, and when started, says that it's using Python 3.4 (as long as the virtualenv was created with -p /usr/bin/python3.4).\nIt seems these instructions need to be changed.\n", "Q: 12.04 or 14.04 for an old computer?

Try \"translating\" the yum commands using these guidelines and test-run them on an Ubuntu system. If they run successfully, then you should be alright.\n\nA: You're asking if there are parts of the code other than yum calls that should be modified.\nIt's sometimes hard to know this for sure, since the software your script automatically downloads and uses (cpanm) could have bugs or other issues that make it work differently on different distributions. I suspect that is not the case, but I cannot know for sure.\nThere can be other problems too. For example, your script downloads cpanm to /usr/bin, which is fine, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the script had downloaded it to a directory that is typically listed in PATH in RHEL/Fedora systems but not Ubuntu, that could cause the script to fail. That's not the case here.\n\n*cpanm is provided in Ubuntu's official software sources. You can install it with sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get install cpanminus. If it is installed, then you should not run this script (as written) because it would probably overwrite the existing cpanm, causing a different file to be installed than the local package database believes is installed. Therefore I recommend checking to make sure the cpanminus package is not installed before using this script.\n\n*If the cpanminus package is installed, you can remove it, or you can modify the script to not download cpanm itself. (Whether or not that will work depends on how specific your needs are to the specific version of cpanm it downloads, but most likely it will work.) Or you could modify the script to download the cpanm package to another directory, like /usr/local/bin or /opt/bin. To make sure the script-downloaded cpanm is the one that is run, make sure the directory it's downloaded to appears in your PATH before /usr/bin.\n\n*There may be other such subtle differences.\n\n\nWith that said, we can see if there are any other obvious changes (besides changing yum install -y ... to apt-get update followed by apt-get install -y ..., and changing the package names as kraxor explains) that are needed, by enumerating all the commands you are using--except yum--and seeing if any of them are missing or work in a substantially different way on Ubuntu from the way they work on RHEL/Fedora.\nYou have (in order of first appearance):\n\n\n*\n\n*set: This is a shell builtin and works the same in most Bourne-style shells; it does not have to be changed.\n\n*cd: This is a shell builtin and works the same in basically every Unix shell ever.\n\n*curl: While wget is more commonly used on Ubuntu systems and curl is not installed by default, if it's not installed you can simply install it with sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl. I don't recommend adding that to your script; just run it yourself before using the script for the first time. It's a bit odd that your script uses both wget and curl--most scripters pick one--but there's nothing wrong with using both, so long as both are installed.\n\n*chmod: This is a standard command that works almost exactly the same on all Unix-like systems.\n\n*cpanm: This is the command the script downloads and installs before using. Unless it has idiosyncracies that make it work differently on Ubuntu, it should work just the same. See above about the possibility of using the version of cpanm officially provided in Ubuntu, instead.\n\n*tar: This is a standard command and while some flags are GNU/Linux specific, it works essentially the same on all recent GNU/Linux systems including any version of Ubuntu, RHEL, or Fedora in the past decade or so. Furthermore, the flags used (x, z, and f) are supported by essentially every tar implementation ever.\n\n*rm: Like chmod, this is a standard command that works almost exactly the same on all Unix-like systems.\n\n*ln: Like chmod and rm, this is a standard command that works almost exactly the same on all Unix-like systems.\n\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu 14.04 on my Mac Pro 1,1 with a raw hard drive by a bootable USB stick I have a Mac Pro 1,1 and I replaced the original hard drive with a new 3TB hard drive (just got, never initialized).\nI try to install ubuntu by a bootable USB stick which I crated on my Mac \nWhen I fellow the instruction on [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacPro][2]\nHowever I find out it does not work.\nAnd in this instruction, it mentioned Mac pro 1,1 is EFI incompatibilities, That is also the reason I can not install rEFind. This instruction has a link [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/11.04/release/][3] seems can help my situation, but that page is not available.\nNow the bootable USB stick never show up when I restart my Mac pro with pressing the option button.\nI appreciate any answer can help me out.\n\nA: Look for the ISO's with \"amd64+mac\" in the name. There are both Desktop and Server versions. \nGo to this page: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/ to see the full list of available ISO's for download. Again, look for the \"amd64+mac.\" It's faster to download them as torrents if you can.\nMy aim is to convert three of these Mac Pros into Ubuntu servers along with an XServe 1,1 as their master for a private cloud at work. All of them have 32GB RAM installed, and these machines are still in great condition. I'd hate to have to discard them just because Apple will no longer update Mac OS X Lion when Yosemite is released.\n\nA: The Mac Pro 1,1 is special in that it has a 32-bit EFI. Later models have a 64-bit EFI which does not have as many issues installing linux.\nThe easiest way to run Ubuntu (or any linux, really) on a Mac Pro 1,1 (2006) is installing VirtualBox on your MacOsX, and running linux in a virtual machine. \nThe alternative is described here: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnIntelMacPro\nBut, again, save yourself a lot of hassle and just run linux in a virtual machine.\n\nA: What I had to do is install the amd64 version of Ubuntu 12.04, and then go through the upgrade to 14.04, and then 16.04.  Pain in the posterior extremus, but it worked, and much more satisfactory than what I had to do before, which was run 32-bit Ubuntu (on a Mac Pro with dual quad-core 64-bit processors.)  \n", "Q: Was developing WUBI a difficult endeavour? Why or Why Not? The only thing which I know about WUBI, is that it allowed you to install Ubuntu on NTFS. One might think that this was an easy application to develop, as all it was on the surface, was installing Ubuntu on another file system, just as you may install Ubuntu on FAT, ext2, reiserfs, etc.\nSo with this in mind; was creating a piece of software that installed ubuntu on a Windows machine an easy endeavour?\n\nA: Wubi uses a virtual disk (c:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk), so it's not actually installed on NTFS in the original sense.\nThe Wikipedia article on Wubi explains pretty well how it works. To answer your question, let me quote a few lines from the History section:\n\nA number of Linux distributions, including Red Hat Linux and\n  Slackware's ZipSlack, provided a similar tool in the mid 1990s, using\n  syslinux and the UMSDOS filesystem driver. Later, SuSE provided\n  something similar using syslinux and loop-mounted disk images on FAT\n  filesystems. During the late '90s BeOS used a similar system to\n  install the OS in a folder in Windows.\n\nSo, Wubi was not an original idea, it was just an implementation of an installer that uses a loopmounted device.\n", "Q: Switching to Terminal-only fails I attempt to switch to terminal-only using\nsudo service stop lightdm\n\nand this turns off the GUI, but I can't type in any commands, although there is a cursor that shows up.

I'm hoping to give a security scanner a user that can read everything but not change or execute anything.

Then forgot it. So I went in via a live CD and changed it as root. Also, when I changed my password originally, I used sudo (not that this should matter) as the normal user.\nThe (possible) saving grace is that I have a rough idea of what the password was - just can't seem to re-create it for the login passphrase for ecryptfs.\nWhen I created my encrypted directory a couple of years ago, I recall writing the password I used at the time - it's a plain text English mixed password  - for example it was written down on my piece of paper as (this isn't it BTW!):\n\nHDD password: pa$$w0rd\n\nI'd never really bothered with it since because I had this data written down. I am meticulous in recording digits, upper case etc., and even now recall the program I was watching that inspired me for the password. However, after having read several articles, it appears that the passphrase is actually a 32 byte string.\nI have to admit I am confused, and require some pointers in trying to clear this up.\nPoint-by-point:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I've lost my HDD password and login passphrase, I've read you can't get your data back. Is this even true in light of future developments in computing? What was difficult to crack 10 years ago is much easier now. This would apply to this situation, right?\n\n*Is there any way of recovering this, via security company or hacking (read:editing) the sources to (for example) get John the Ripper to go through all possible permutations to run in the sources of ecryptfs inside the ecryptfs process to try it that way?\n\n*is the HDD password I wrote down relevant? I've only ever encrypted a file system once, and can't recall how it was done - might my text password, pa$$w0rd, have been used in generating the text for the HDD password? Because whenever it prompts for the passphrase in ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase, inputting pa$$w0rd does not work.\n\n*Should ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase work with pa$$w0rd? It does not work and I know I wrote down pa$$w0rd for a specific reason... \n\n*Not sure why, but the files in /home/.ecryptfs/user/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase and /home/user/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase are the same. I thought they'd have been different (since the new user directory is based on a different password) - anyone shed any light on this?\n\n*Also, I can mount my home directory - and have a copy of the files (and their sizes) from a backup disk (shame I didn't do it recently!) - because of that, could I figure out from timestamps and file sizes the missing files, and possibly try to decrypt them individually?\n\n\nI was so adamant in recording this phrase, pa$$w0rd, and can recall doing it, that I can't believe it's not working. Perhaps it was just my user password in the end...\nFeel free to ask any pointed (or blunt!) questions, if you require more information. Petty sure I've lost the lot...\n\nA: If the password you wrote down was the unwrapped passphrase, then you should be able to mount the data by using mount and specifying ecryptfs as the filesystem type, like so:\nmount -t ecryptfs my_encrypted_data my_encrypted_data   # yes, you can use the same directory as a mountpoint.\n\nAnswer the questions accordingly (probably leave everything as default).\nUse password managers and make backups.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 super slow after install I have a Compaq with Intel Atom CPU D410 @ 1.66 Ghz x2, RAM is 2 Gb and Intel IGDx86/MMX/SSE2. \nWhen I boot Ubuntu from the live CD it worked like a charm even in my old computer, so I decided to install it as a dual boot with Windows 7.

Is there any way i can select all the optional/extra packages from this list, and remove them, without causing me loss of access to my VPS via SSH?  I have removed all packages marked as required and important from the list, as noone cares.\n            db-util                                 extra\n            diff

a service temporarily. You can uninstall the packable permananly buy using sudo apt-get remove <packagename>\n\nA: An installed packages does not consume any RAM - only a running program does. Most of the packages in the list do not install anything which runs as a service consuming RAM - for example diff and bzip2 are console commands which don't run unless you invoke them from the console. Removing them would save you a few kilobytes on disk and exactly zero bytes of RAM.\nWhile I definitely can see packages which are not strictly required on a VPS (ttf-dejavu? libsane?), there are also python, sudo and openssh listed as \"optional\". I would not recommend you removing these.\nInstead, look at the list of running services and deactivate the ones you don't need - like, uninstall Apache and sendmail if you're not going to use them. \n\nA: Bash Script and some python string magic\nHere is the python I used to generate the script:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7966133/\nHere is the script you can run:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7966136/\nJust make sure you run it in the command line.

But I cannot find the font any where. I have allowed bitmap fonts in fontconfig.\n\nA: You have to put the .ttf file in your home, particularly in the .fonts folder (and create the folder if it's not there). \nAsuming you have your font (myfont.ttf) in your Downloads folder (~/Downloads or /home/**yourname**/Downloads -which is the same thing written in a different way-), the commands you should run are:\nmkdir -p ~/.fonts  \ncp ~/Downloads/myfont.ttf ~/.fonts/  \n\nDone!\nModern versions of Ubuntu (from 12.04 and on) doesn't need you to run a font-cache update.

I'd like to regularly copy all new files to HDD2, without rewriting everything (because it takes a really long time). All files = config files, data etc.\nHow can i do it? I tried\nrsync -avxHAX --numeric-ids --progress / /media/ken/asdasdx --exclude={/dev/*,/mnt/*,/media/*} > ~/rsync.out\n\nBut that seems to rewrite all the files as well.\n\nA: I just stumbled across the answer...\nman rsync\n--ignore-existing       skip updating files that exist on receiver\n\n", "Q: Grub boot menu not available after installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on MSI GE 60 I installed Windows 8.1 on an MSI GE60 laptop; then proceeded to partition it using GParted (resized the NTFS partitions) and installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS in the free space I created /dev/sda8. \nWhen I run bootinfoscript after logging into Ubuntu, the output looks as follows (see below, excuse the rather long cut-paste). The problem I am having is that I do not have a grub boot menu that allows me to choose which OS to boot into (I used to be able to do this with 8.04 Hardy Heron and 10.04 without much trouble on an older laptop). It boots into Ubuntu by default. The only way I am able to boot into Windows is by hitting the delete key when the MSI logo appears, entering BIOS, and changing the value of the option for Boot Mode Select option from Legacy to UEFI. \nAppreciate if anyone has any ideas or suggestions to help me get the grub boot menu option which gives me both OS choices to boot into, so that I don't have to go into the BIOS everytime I want to work in Windows. \nThanks in advance for your time & ideas.\nMy settings in /etc/default/grub looks as follows:\n# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update\n#

The two modes are not compatible and you can only dual boot from UEFI/BIOS menu and may have to turn on or off UEFI or BIOS boot settings. Grub can only dual boot other installs in same boot mode as you booted grub. You can use Boot-Repair to convert a BIOS install of Ubuntu to UEFI if drive is gpt partitioned which Windows requires if it is in UEFI mode\nBut this didn't work likely because boot repair isn't up-to-date for 14.04.1 LTS (got some error in the end). So I ended up doing the following: \nFormatted the partition containing my 14.04.1 LTS and re-installed after rebooting from BIOS this time keeping UEFI mode active and fast boot disabled. This worked without any issues and presented the dual boot option from the get-go.\n", "Q: Fresh install of Kubuntu 14.04 on desktop system will not shutdown. Why?

Then drag it whereever you like. Like so:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to ‘System Settings > Appearance’\n\n*Select the ‘Behavior’ tab\n\n*Find the section headed: ‘Show the Menus for a Window’\n\n*Check (click) the circle next to ‘In the window’s title bar’\n\n\nA: I assume you are using the main edition of Ubuntu 14.04 x64. Unfortunately the desktop environment of main edition called Unity lacks any ability of customization - you can't move anything.\nYou can try installing other desktop environments such as Xfce. You can read how to install Xfce in your Ubuntu 14.04 in this site. In Xfce you can move \"panels\" (taskbars) to either top or bottom of the screen and you can also customize the contents (applets) of the taskbar.\n\nA: I know this question is for 14.04, but as this is one of the first results for \"moving taksbar to bottom\", I think it will be helpful to others like me who want to do this on Ubuntu 16.04:\nJust execute the following command:  \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher launcher-position Bottom\n\nOr, if you prefer something more detailed, and more options, install unity tweak tool, as explained in the accepted answer.\n\nA: In Pop OS, I needed to:\n\n*\n\n*press win key, type 'settings'\n\n*go to 'System Settings > Desktop > Dock'\n\n\nA: if you click on panel preferences (right click), you can move the panel whilst in this mode (on my computer it is highlighted with a red dashed border). The icons don't line up but its better then before. You also delete the panel, by using the plus or minus on the panel preferences pane.\n", "Q: How to burn an ISO file larger 4.7 GB onto a DVD I downloaded centos everything ISO which about 6.4GB in size however I could not write that ISO file onto a DVD using k3b tool as it is showing Blank dvd doesn't have enough space. I want to dual boot my computer one with Ubuntu and another one with Centos, For installing CENTOS i need to write that everything ISO on to the DVD which is of 4.7 GB in capacity and then go for installation.\nHow should i ?\n\nA: It's just a matter of media.\nIf the DVD ISO you have to write onto the media is bigger than 4.7 GB, you can use double-layer DVD if your writer is able to support this kind of DVD. \nThen you can put almost the double of 4.7 GB on a single double-layer DVD.\nOf course, if the ISO size exceeds the size limit of a double-layer DVD, you cannot do anything more with a DVD.\n\nA: There are two links to download CentOS 7 (the latest version) from the download site at centos.org. If you choose the first link by clicking the button that says DVD ISO you be asked to select a mirror and then download a 3.9GB CentOS ISO file that will fit nicely on a DVD. Clicking the other download button will download a bigger ISO that has a lot of additional packages that you don't need.\nAlternatively CentOS can also be written to an 8GB USB flash drive (or larger than 8GB) using UNetbootin from the default Ubuntu repositories. For general instructions about how to create a bootable USB stick using UNetbootin see this answer.\n\nUNetbootin has been dropped from the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories.\nWhen I tested the built-in Startup Disk Creator application as a UNetbootin replacement app with 3 non-*buntu live .iso images it worked  in Ubuntu 18.04.\n", "Q: Developing NodeJS for Ubuntu Touch: I'm new here and interested in developing apps for Ubuntu Touch. Already got the developer version running on a tablet model P3110.\nWhat I'd like to know is if it's compatible with NodeJS or if it's possible to create apps using that technology given that I read it accepts Javascript.\nOr is it better to use HTML5/QML? If so, why?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: WebApps\nAs far as I know, HTML5 Web Applications which run on Ubuntu [Touch] are simply a Chromeless browser running your application \"like\" a native application in Ubuntu, with some low-level API to access a few features of Ubuntu (currently, only Desktop). So it doesn't matter what server-side language you use, Node.js or whatever.\nPhoneGap\nWe can't forget this one, ever. Phonegap supports Ubuntu, too. This initially means Ubuntu Desktop, but lemme quote this:\n\nCross compiling applications for Ubuntu Touch on ARM is natively supported by the cordova-ubuntu platform support module, as of version 3.4 or superior.\n\nSo you can make Ubuntu applications which run on ARM-based CPUs, too.\nThis is a list of APIs supported by PhoneGap\nNative\nOf course, native has always been the best choice, and probably will stay as the best for a while. If you want blazingly fast apps with access to every API, native is the way to go.\n\nA: With QML applications there is a deep integration javascript ! And you can compile your application on Linux, Mac, windows, ubuntu touch, blackberry, android, ios, windows phone\n", "Q: Why does Nautilus show a file and its hard link as bigger than just the file? When I create a hard link to a 2 KB file (called fun), Nautilus shows this hard link (called fun-hard) as a file with the same size. These two files are pointing to same inode so their combined properties should display only 2 KB as well. But Nautilus instead says their total size is 4 KB. Why?\n\nA: Of course, if you create a hard link to a file, then both the original file and the hard link point to the same inode. In fact, both are equivalent - for the system there is no such thing as \"the original\" and \"the link\". They are simply two access points to the same inode. Consequently, they take up no more space together than if you had only one access point (except for the tiniest bit of information in the filesystem, where two pointers to some inode are stored instead of only one).\nYou can easily confirm this when you use a low-level filesystem utility such as, for instance, du. For example, here I have a directory with a single song (FOSS Yeaaaah!, an awesome song about Ubuntu by Ben Kerensa) of about 2.1 MB:\n$ ls -li \ntotal 2124\n6424897 -rw-rw-r-- 1 malte malte 2162937 Aug  7 12:53 FOSS Yeaaaah!.mp3\n$ du -ch * # display size of all files, and total size\n2.1M    FOSS Yeaaaah!.mp3\n2.1M    total\n$ du -h . # display size of current directory\n2.1M    .\n\nWhen I create a hard link, say Link.mp3, to the file, du actually recognizes that both filenames point to the same file and only displays one of both:\n$ ln FOSS\\ Yeaaaah\\!.mp3 Link.mp3\n$ ls -li\ntotal 4248\n6424897 -rw-rw-r-- 2 malte malte 2162937 Aug  7 12:53 FOSS Yeaaaah!.mp3\n6424897 -rw-rw-r-- 2 malte malte 2162937 Aug  7 12:53 Link.mp3\n$ du -ch *\n2.1M    FOSS Yeaaaah!.mp3\n2.1M    total\n$ du -h .\n2.1M    .\n\n(It's displaying only the one that comes first in alphabetical order - had I named the hardlink A.mp3, then du would have displayed that one).\nThe behavior you're experiencing is most probably a bug or inaccuracy in whatever software you are using to display file sizes. If it's Nautilus (the standard file browser in a typical Ubuntu installation), then I can confirm that behavior. See this bug report:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/644403\nIt may just be \"a feature, not a bug\" - as Nautilus is trying to keep things simple for the average user, it simply ignores hard links. Which may not always be the best idea. Quoting from the bug report:\n\nNautilus tries to keep things simple. That's why it does not offer a way to make hardlinks. But if things are already complicated - if hardlinks are already present - just ignoring them can lead to problems of its own.\n\nIn summary, if you're working with hard links, better rely on a terminal instead of some file browsing application.\n", "Q: PIL install in Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS Followed the steps How do I install python imaging library (PIL)? for pre-setup libraries to install PIL on Ubuntu 14.04.

The fix is in kernel 3.19.0-26. The next kernel update will fix the issue for Ubuntu 15.04 and 14.04.3.\nAfter that the package and the PPA can be removed by\nsudo apt-get purge ideapad-laptop-dkms\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:hanipouspilot/ideapad-laptop\n\nUpdate For those who uses kernel 3.19 this ppa can be removed since 3.19.0-26 kernel includes this patch.\nNow the issue is fixed in all Ubuntu kernels.\n\nA: try removing the ideapad_laptop module\nfor one time test:  \n\nsudo rmmod ideapad_laptop\n\nfor working after reboot:\n\necho \"blacklist ideapad_laptop\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ideapad.conf\n\nSource: praseodym (german)\nubuntu-forum.de\nProove :\nwe have 2 of those laptops here and i had the same issue, it was fixed by this.\nI tested the 14.10 Development version and 14.04.\nSome do say the never kernel version (3.15 onwards) should solve this, it did not for me.\nOther comments here on AU tell that you can enable wireless by doing:\n\nBoot windows install the wifi drivers and the energy management solution from lenovo and enable WIFI there.\n\nAs i wiped the WIN8 installation i cannot tell if that works, too.\n", "Q: If linux can support NTFS file system then why cannot it be installed on same? After learning basics of installation and types of file system, I found that Linux(Ubuntu) can open,create and delete file on an NTFS file system, where as windows can't even see ext series! so my question if Linux can scan and modify the file operations on NTFS why can't it be installed on an NTFS partition (irrespective of Primary or Logical).\n\nA: That is mainly because Linux has a strict permissions policy for its OS, from the user's directory on to the kernel. These permissions are not supported by the NTFS file system.\nSee this link for an interesting comparison on file systems.\n\nA: Aside from permission issues and POSIX compatibility, the NTFS filesystem check utilities are not capable of fixing all the issues that Windows' chkdsk.exe can. \nThis is not an issue when dual-booted with Windows (unless you don't have a separate /boot partition, in which case everything would be unbootable).

So I uninstalled OpenSSL 1.0.1 and install new 1.0.1h version by refering this link. I have applied patch for 1.0.1h version and this installed OpenSSL successfully.\nNow on the second day, I am seeing OpenSSL reverted back to 1.0.1 (default version which comes with Ubuntu 12.04.4).\nIs there any setting or configuration that automatically replaces OpenSSL to its default version? How will I stop this automatic rollback of OpenSSL to default version?\n\nA: If you want to stop a package from beeing automatically updated each time you run the apt-get upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade command, you have to put then on hold to the package management system.\nThis can be done by the following command :\necho \"openssl hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nWhen you do dpkg --get-selections | grep openssl, you will see the following :\nopenssl                hold\n\nAnd then, when you run sudo apt-get upgrade, you will see an output like this one :\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information... Done\nCalculating upgrade... Done\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n   openssl\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.\n\nAttention :\nOf course, you will then become the only one responsible to update the version of OpenSSL, you will have to watch the security bulletins, the patches published and so on\nImportant note :\nThe Linux distribution (Ubuntu and others) use their own way of versioning and patching cycles, this means that the version N of package XXXX present in the repositories, can already incorporate a security patch that was applied mainstream on the version N+1 but that was ported to version N by the distribution maintainers.\n\nA: Those instructions are not Ubuntu-specific and are not the recommended way to patch the Heartbleed bug on Ubuntu. In fact, they are intended for people who have compiled OpenSSL themself rather than using a version of it that was supplied with their Linux distribution (eg Ubuntu) - or they want to apply a patch manually before the OS patches their version - neither of which is the case.  Ubuntu's version of OpenSSL in Precise has been patched since April (with version 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12).\nIn order to patch Heartbleed on Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a version of Ubuntu which is still getting security support (12.04.* is fine)\n\n*Install all automatic updates\nThat's it.  Though, if you had SSL certificates that were in use prior to the heartbleed bug being discovered and fixed, you should re-issue those certificates.\n", "Q: How to install kingsoft office in ubuntu 14.04 64 bit?

It is customary NOT to start a graphic subsytem for root --- and the upstart scripts are run by root. \nTo automatically start a graphic application at the start of the system, my approach would be: \n\n\n*\n\n*create a user for this purpose. Set it up so that its session will autostart.\n\n\n*set up a startup application for this user with the program you want; choose \"startup application\" in the dash:\n\n\n*for restarting the application when it exits/crashes, you can simply embed it in a script: \n     #!/bin/bash\n     #\n     while true; do \n          /full/path/to/start_myapp.sh    # NO background (&)!\n          # if we land here it exited\n          sleep 5\n     done\n\nIf you use this script, it is really important that the command start_myapp.sh should not launch the application in background. Otherwise, more complex strategies are required to auto-restart...\nNotice that you can use your normal user in parallel too; just choose \"switch user\" from the panel (adapt to your flavor of Ubuntu) and you will have another graphical login screen; you can switch back-an-forth using CTRL-ALT-F7 and CTRL-ALT-F8...\n", "Q: program for Compressing and Downloading updates in ubuntu like delta rpm in fedora I would like to know if there are any programs in ubuntu that compress the size of the updates to be downloaded from the repositories to save the bandwidth while updating the system with mobile data network.

It is intended to appear as a mounted file system, but stored in volatile memory instead of a persistent storage device.\nSee Wikipedia article on tmpfs.\n/run/lock\nOnce again a virtual and temporary filesystem used to store locks files created by running process (files telling that the process is running). It resides also in memory, so if the system is rebooted, it comes back empty, even if the process was badly stopped, not letting him the time to delete his lock file(s).\nPreviously, a real filesystem directory was used (/var/lock).\n/run/shm\nThis virtual filesystem is convenient way to use a portion of the memory as any other filesystem. Any process can read and write into /run/shm, which physically resides into the shard memory of the system. \n/run/user\nThis another virtual filesystem is needed by some processes related to user and profile management (related to PAM and systemd - see Wikipedia for systemd).\n/boot/efi\nThis is the partition on your disk when your EFI system files are located.

Hi i have developed two charms server charm and application charm.I need to add relation between them and and want to get server IP address for application charm.I have added relation-joined and relation-changed hook files for both server charm and application charm.Then i can build relationships between them.Now i have problem my relation-joined and relation-changed hook files are not running.Only running config-changed,install and start hooks files.This is the way i followed.(How do I add a relationship between two charms to pass information between them? anyone tell me why these relation hooks are not running.and how the flow working for relation hooks.\nThanks\nSajith\n\nA: The thing to keep in mind about juju relations is that we dont bind to any official spec. We're not forcing you to implement an RFC to exchange information between the services. \nWith that said, lets dissect your particular question here.\nIn terms of Server and Application, lets use gitlab-ci and gitlab-ci-runner as our server/application model. With gitlab-ci being the server, and gitlab-ci-runner as the application. our deployment model is a one to many, with 1 server, and many applications. (we can have many servers, but i want to keep the example concise) \nGitlab-CI metadata\nWe first define the relationship in the gitlab-ci metadata. \nprovides:\n  ci-job:\n    interface: ci-worker\n\nThis single statement tells juju that we have a ci-job relation, using the ci-worker interface. With this relationship definition, we have 4 possible states that we can consume to make changes.\nci-job-joined, ci-job-changed, ci-job-broken, ci-job-departed\nThe convention for this, is relation-name-event - so moving forward, we have those 4 possible event hooks attached to a relation name. They execute in the following sequence:\n\n\n*\n\n*relation-joined\n\n*relation-changed\n\n*relation-broken\n\n*relation-departed\n\n\nJoined is for \"pre-work\" and is a place for you to do any work necessary to prep the service to receive the relationship (backing up an existing local SQLite database, for example).\nChanged is executed any time a change is detected in the relationship. This sometimes gets triggered when the remote charm has a config update, and may not necessarily reflect a required change on your service - so be 100% sure its idempotent.\nBroken is executed when you first break the relationship. This is when you would want to do any data-backups, and reconfiguration to remove the remote configuration.\nDeparted is any final wrap-up work for removing the relationship.

You can check this with the mount command without options. In the following example I could run ~/executable.bin but not /run/shm/file.sh\ntmpfs on /run/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=1593900k)\n/dev/sda5 on /home type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,nodiratime,relatime,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered,discard)\n\n\n*Other more advanced scenarios such as\n3.1 SELinux restrictions\nAgain, this is not the case, the ls -l output would show a dot in the permissions column (-rwxr-xr-x.)\n3.2 ulimit constraints\nNot your problem, and probably the message error would be different (feel free to edit the post and remove this entry if you think it only adds noise to the answer).\nPS: If you provide the output of mount too, we will check option #2.\n\nA: You dont need to implement difficult compilation procedures to install FFMPEG in ubuntu.

If you use sudo su - or sudo -s you will have full root privileges.\nIs this root user an official user or is it from Canonical?\n~$ sudo su -\n[sudo] password for username: \nroot@lp:~# id\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\nroot@lp:~# pwd\n/root\nroot@lp:~# \n\n\nA: Yes the root user is an official one.\nThat user comes from a long line of historical influences. It's the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions. Most Unix-linke operating systems have a root user. It's not always called \"root\". You may know the Administrator of Windows operating systems.\nThe sudo program allows one to perform some action as root, such as run a command, run a shell, or log in (in a terminal only). Using sudo allows one to access root privilege only as needed, conforming to the principle of least privilege. The sudo program also provides control over the execution environment for the commands run with it, i.e. whether root's user configurations or your own are used when commands are run.\nIn Ubuntu, logging in as the root user directly is disabled by default, to make it less likely that one will cause damage to the system or create security problems by making some mistake as root.\nThe root user can do things that a normal user cannot for example:\n\n*\n\n*Change the owner and permissions of files/directories, regardless of the current owner or permissions\n\n*Bind network ports below 1024\n\nThe root user always has the UID 0 and can be identified by this UID. It is possible to create another user called root, but not for there to be two users with the same UID, hence, there is only one root. It is compulsory to have such a user.\nShort digression about sudo:\nThe sudo program works because it has the \"suid-bit\" (set user id bit). This allows any user to run the program as the owner of the program. Obviously, this is an enormous security risk, and so sudo performs strict checks to see whether the user attempting to run it has the right to use sudo at all, and which commands they are allowed to run with it. This configuration is stored in the file /etc/sudoers, which should only be edited with the visudo command (you need sudo to run visudo). During installation, one sets up a first user account in Ubuntu. This first user will automatically have the right to run any command with sudo.\nIf the sudo executable or /etc/sudoers have wrong permissions, sudo will refuse to run.\n\nA: It is root. \nIn Ubuntu root defaults to having no password set so you have to sudo su - or sudo -s to login as root. Or if you really wanted, set a password for root and bypass the need for sudo (not adviseable)\nsudo su -\nOpen the root users default environment, So you get the root users shell etc..\nsudo -s\nWill open the shell defined in the variable$SHELL or /etc/passwd for the invoking user not the root user. This method you get to keep some extra enviromental  variables so you know who done the sudo etc...   \n", "Q: Ricoh MPC3300 printing sheet per sheet on Ubuntu 14.04 I have installed the Ricoh MPC3300 printer on my laptop.\nI used the choose from Database option and chose for the MPC 3300.\nThe drivers works but is very slow.

The VM are very slow and mostly not usable (on a VM with Windows 7 the simple login can take 5 minutes when it takes 1 second with 3.8 kernel).\nWith the 12.04.5 I can use the VM normally with a little CPU usage and a very low disk I/O profile.\nSo the problem is clearly the kernel 3.13 and I don't want to use it.\nI found very annoying that for an LTS version the HWE is not maintained any more and that I'm forced to do an upgrade to an unusable 14.04 to be able to have the updates (I've found many other things that don't work well on 14.04, for example the gdm that has syntax errors in the service scripts).\nSo it's simple, I want keep the 12.04.5 until the next stable release but I don't want use the 14.04 because has not reached the same quality level of the 12.04 and I don't want to reinstall the system just to try if the VM works.\nSo how to remove the annoying HWE update messages and continue to use the 3.8 kernel with my 12.04.5 LTS? (keeping the security updates of course)\n\nA: No, you can not both use an old unsupported kernel and have security updates for that kernel. No kernel updates means no kernel security updates. From https://wiki.ubuntu.com/1204_HWE_EOL:\n\nStarting Aug 8, 2014 systems running 12.04.2 HWE, 12.04.3 HWE, or\n  12.04.4 HWE will no longer receive software updates for the kernel and, if you're running it, the graphics stack.\n\nAccording to the kernel release schedule, 3.8 is already unsupported, so if you want an older kernel with security updates you will need to downgrade to Ubuntu 12.04.1 and the 3.2 kernel:\n\n", "Q: Any way to get Nvidia Optimus card working on 14.04.1?

For example, my very first wallpaper was of Elsa from Frozen, and then something else from an anime Bleach.

It's Ubuntu 13.10 (don't give me that support has ended thing, it's merely a technical problem that can be solved). I also tried putting that picture in the Wallpapers directory (Home/Pictures/Wallpapers).\nWhy This is Not a Duplicate\nHow do I add customized wallpapers so they appear in the dynamic unity greeter? is about adding an image to the default directory so that they can be changed via Right Click>Change Desktop.\nHow to change login wallpaper? is about having a separate image for background and another for the login screen.\nGradients backgrounds gives default wallpaper on login screen. is about another default wallpaper and it not showing, instead having the default wallpaper.\nDesktop Background doesn't show up on logon screen [duplicate] is a duplicate that leads to the first question I mentioned here.\nAnd they're all I could find in the search.\n\nA: I found a solution that might fit for you in the following question:\nChanging login screen wallpaper\nThey recommend using the following commands:\nsudo -i\nxhost +SI:localuser:lightdm\nsu lightdm -s /bin/bash\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-user-backgrounds 'true'\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background 'imagepath'\nexit\n\nreplace imagepath with your actual image path and then it should work fine. Make sure that your path is correct, because otherwise it may result in a black background.\n\nA: For me this is was a file permissions problem. I fixed this by setting image permissions in nautilus to:\n\nOwner - Read and Write \nGroup - Read and Write \nOthers - Read only\n\n\nA: The only way I could make this work in 16.04 was to have my custom wallpaper image masquerade as a default system wallpaper, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*As su, copy the image to /usr/share/backgrounds\n\n*As su, edit /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/$(lsb_release -cs)-wallpapers.xml\n\n*Copy and modify one of the \"<wallpaper>\" elements to register the new wallpaper.\n\n*Save the file.\n\n", "Q: How to boot Ubuntu automatically? I am using Ubuntu GNOME 13.10. I have made one backup image with Clonezilla. The backup includes 2 partitions — one is /dev/sda1, where is the EFI (only the EFI folder from /boot/efi/EFI), and the other is /dev/sda2/, where is my root directory with all other files (/). I have installed the OS through EFI.\nEverything was fine — I could restore my backup without any problems. But I bought new hard disk drive, because of failure of the old one.\nI installed the new hard disk and everything was fine again, except one thing. I am restoring the backup without any problems, but after the POST screen the OS is not booting — it opens the GRUB command-line interface every time!\nI boot the OS with the following commands:\nlinux (hd0,gpt2)/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2\ninitrd (hd0,gpt2)/initrd.img\nboot\n\nThe OS boots, but on the screen I see this error: The disk drive /boot/efi is not ready yet or not present. Okay, I have found the solution for this — the OS boots in BIOS mode, not in EFI and I removed the EFI line in /etc/fstab. The error does not show on the screen anymore.\nBut the GRUB command-line interface starts before the OS every time. And I need to load the kernel manually on every startup. How to make the OS start automatically?\nAnd how to make the OS to boot in EFI again (it is not mandatory, but I am searching for a solution)?\nThank you!\n\nA: It seems like your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file is broken. Maybe GRUB tries to boot your system partition by UUID, but your new partition have different UUID? You can check your partition UUID by running this in terminal:\nsudo blkid\n\nThat UUID should also be in your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file, so if it isn't there, it might be the problem. You can correct it manually or just update GRUB files:\nsudo update-grub\n\nIf it doesn't help, you can try reinstalling GRUB:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\nsudo update-grub\n\n(where /dev/sdX is your system drive).\nIf you can't boot your system, you can use Live CD, of course, but you need to bind your /dev, /proc and /sys directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu GNOME 13.10 ISO file.\n\n*Burn it on CD or pendrive (with UNetbootin).\n\n*Boot from that Live CD.\n\n*In terminal:\nMount your system root drive, where /dev/sdXY is partition with your system, you can check it in GParted to be sure.\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nBind some directories GRUB needs access to.\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nChange your root directory.\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nInstall GRUB (/dev/sdX is where GRUB will be installed, e.g. MBR sector of your system drive).\ngrub-install /dev/sdX\nupdate-grub\n\nReturn to your normal root directory and unmount all.\nexit\n\nsudo umount /mnt/dev\nsudo umount /mnt/proc\nsudo umount /mnt/sys\nsudo umount /mnt\n\n\n*Now reboot and your GRUB should work.\n", "Q: CUPS, shared printer, Windows drivers, point and print I know this is a commonly asked question but I'm read up everything I can find, and I think I'm very nearly there!\nThe setup is:\nHeadless Ubuntu Trusty machine with CUPS and SAMBA installed, ready to act as a print server for a network printer.

If so, what?\n\nA: It is now EXT4.\nEXT4 is a sucsessor to EXT3 and 2.\nWith the first Linux versions, EXT was used:\n\nThe extended file system, or ext, was implemented in April 1992 as the first file system created specifically for the Linux kernel.\n\nInspired by the Unix File System (UFS) it was:\n\ndesigned by Rémy Card to overcome certain limitations of the MINIX file system.\n\nAs both EXT and Linux developed and became more advanced, Linux was designed around EXT, and it became the best filesystem for it to run on, and so EXT developed around Linux.\nEach new version of EXT4 became better for linux, with support for things that linux needed.\nSo why not NTFS?\n\nNTFS doesn't support Linux file permissions so you can't install a Linux system on it.\n\nHowever,\n\nLinux kernel versions 2.2.0 and later include the ability to read NTFS partitions\n\nAdvantages of EXT:\n\nLarge file system: Can support volumes with sizes up to 1 EiB and files up to 16 TiB.\nExtents: Extents improve large file performance and reduce fragmentation.\nBackward compatible with ext3 and ext2\nPersistent pre-allocation\nDelayed allocation: It delays block allocation until it writes data to disk, improving performance and reducing fragmentation.\nIncreasing the 32,000 subdirectory limit to be unlimited.\nJournal checksumming: Using checksums in the journal to improves reliability, since the journal is one of the most used files of the disk.\nFaster file system checking\nImproved timestamps: It provides timestamps measured in nanoseconds, needed for critical data on some servers. Also, 2 bits of the timestamp field are added to the significant bits of the seconds field to defer the year 2038 problem for 204 years.\n\nSo essentially, it is used because it is better!\nSources:\nWikipedia EXT article\nAsk Ubuntu on NTFS\n\nA: I think the most important reason that ext4 is used as default is that it provides the best mix of stability, speed, and reliability for a the greatest range of workloads. Benchmarks routinely show it near the top in  performance in all workloads. Other filesystems may beat it on a single benchmark, but often perform much worse on others. Btrfs has it's strengths but has poor db  performance including sqlite (which a lot of desktop applications use). Reiserfs has better small file performance but was unstable. \nReally the only other major filesystem that comes close is xfs. Which also has a long  development history like ext4.

I have already had Windows installed on another partition. I installed Ubuntu and the installation has been finished successfully.\nAfter rebooting the system, the OS selection screen didn't come up, and it started to boot Windows immediately with an error.

I can boot Ubuntu from the USB now, and the Ubuntu data are saved on the HDD.

I found similar threads, except, I am able to ping my own Host name and IP address and my windows can ping my linux host name, but Ubuntu can not ping the windows hostname.\nProblem:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have 4 windows computers and I have 1 Ubuntu Computer\n\n*My windows Computer can ping Ubuntu Computer by Hostname and by IP address. Also, Net \nView (cmd prompt) displays the host name of Ubuntu Computer.\n\n*Ubuntu Computer can only Ping by IP address only Not by hostname. I installed Samba as well. \n\n*Ubuntu Computer can ping itself by IP address and by Hostname\n\n*I can use arp command and will display all the computers IP on the network, but only by IP address.\n\n\nHow is it that I can only ping by IP address and not by hostname to the windows computers? But Ubuntu can ping itself by IP address and Hostname and windows computers can ping Ubuntu by hostname as well?\n\nA: The problem described here may not be related to DNS at all.\nYou have to know that Windows can resolve the Windows hostname to its IP via other mechanisms than standard DNS : NetBIOS lookup, WINS, ...\nAs you said you have Samba installed on your Ubuntu, this is probably what's happening. On all of your Windows machine, it is possible, out-of-the-box, to have the Windows name resolved to its IP address. As Samba is installed on Ubunut, for your Windows PC, they see the Ubuntu PC as a Windows PC and the same resolution is possible.\nYou tell that you run net view on Windows and you see your Ubuntu PC, so the NetBIOS name is well published on your network, so it works from Windows.\nTo achieve the same behaviour on Ubuntu as on Windows, you have to install and configure additional pieces of software. What you need is to add a lookup library that will allows Ubuntu to convert NetBIOS names to IP. This library is contained into the libnss-winbind package.\nAs any other Ubuntu packages, you install it by doing sudo apt-get install libnss-winbind. May be the library is already installed, you can check it presence by doing dpkg -l|grep libnss-winbind.\nOnce the library is installed, you have to enable it in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file. This file is the configuration file for the NSS (Name Service Switch), which defines from which sources Linux is able to resolve hostname, usernames, groupnames and so on.\nIn this file, you already have a line starting by hosts:, probably looking like this\nhosts:          files dns\n\nThis tells your system to first look into the /etc/hosts file and then into the configured DNS to resolve hostnames.\nYou have to modify this way :\nhosts:          files dns wins\n\nNote that the order of the words files, dns and wins are important. First, the system will check the local file for resolution, then will ask the DNS server and finally, if not yet found, will perform NetBIOS lookup.\nOnce this is updated, to function correctly, you also need to have the winbind service running. The package containing it is a dependency of libnss-winbind, so it has been installed along it.\nDo service winbind start to activate it.\n\nA: Hostnames to IP conversion can occur if:\n-You declare them in the /etc/hosts file (not recommended)\n-You get it from a DNS server.\nI would say your problem can be your network interface configuration has no DNS server or uses not the one Windows boxes use. If they use DHCP interface configuration, DNS configuration is most often included, and if you have a Windows Domain server on your network, they most probably use it as primary DNS.\nTry: 'nslookup some_machine_name' in command line to see what happens. It will tell you which server you're using if any.\nHTH\n", "Q: Do I have to download both the 14.04 and the 14.04.1 versions of ubuntu? In the release page of Ubuntu, I see that both the 14.04.1 and the 14.04 versions are offered for download. Do I need them both? That is, is 14.04 a prerequisite for installing 14.04.1? Or can I just download the last version ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso?\n\nA: The \".1\" is simply 14.04 with all updates up until the start of August 2014 already rolled into it.\nYou can download and install 14.04 and bring it up to date with updates and it will then start showing itself as \"14.04.1\", so the 14.04.1 ISO simply saves you about 300MB worth of updates being downloaded after initial installation.\nAs time goes on, the \".2\" version will be released and so forth. So far most LTS releases have had four point releases in their lifetimes.\nYou can find out if you're on 14.04.1 already by issuing the lsb_release -a command in a terminal. You'll see something like this:\n$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\nThe description shows that we are running the .1 release of 14.04.\n\nA: No, just download 14.04.1 It has lots of good bug fixes, like bug 1309458, it fixes the ubiquity installer crashing when clicking release notes, and bug 1315866 with the usb creator, it's a workaround for Python Qt4 being sucky.\nYou can see the full list of changes here.\nIt is different to the Windows 8 + 8.1 system, in that this was planned to be \"public\". Normally, windows just give their releases \"secretly\", without revealing they are upgrading to what is called a \"point release\".\n14.04.1 hasn't really got any new features, it just comes with all the updates you have to do if you download 14.04 included. \nSo for clarification, you can either download 14.04 + lots of updates, or just 14.04.1. It has them all included already. 14.04 won't have the bugs, but 14.04 is more work to get patched. Kudos @CharlesGreen\nWhen 14.04 is fully updated it identifies as 14.04.1 - they are identical. So I installed 14.04, and when I run \nlsb_release -a\nI get some irrelevant details (for this example) and then:\n...\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\nSo you can see that the Descriptor is 14.04.1 LTS, even though I installed 14.04 (when it was first released).\nMy pronouns are He / Him\n", "Q: How to launch windows on default and Linux by choice?

While you could do that from the config file as root, I would recommend using GRUB Customizer, since it is a graphical interface for editing the boot order and a few other things, like the appearance of GRUB when you're selecting an OS to boot into.\nTry the following in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nIf GRUB Customizer doesn't show up in Ubuntu's applications, then you will be able to launch it with\ngrub-customizer\n\nvia a terminal or the Alt+F2 run command shortcut.\n", "Q: How do I install SRILM on ubuntu 14.04?

Do I need to put yo in my $PATH?  I'm not really sure how to do that..  Additionally, how do I configure npm so I don't have to use sudo npm?\n\nA: It's worth noting that Ubuntu 13.10 is no longer officially supported, but that shouldn't make much of a difference for these instructions.\nnpm without sudo\nFirst things first, let's get permissions sorted out. Most of the Node.js installation guides for Ubuntu instruct you to install Node.js from either the official repositories or from the chris-lea PPA. Either way, you'll end up installing Node.js and NPM using sudo, which leads to a permissions mess on development machines.\nThere's a question on StackOverflow about how to \"fix\" these permissions, although in most cases, you'll have to make your user the owner of /usr/local/lib/node_modules, which is super sketchy.\nInstead, I think the best answer by far is to install Node.js using NVM. In addition to letting you run multiple versions of Node.js on the same computer, this option also keeps everything in your home folder, so your user owns NPM, and you don't have to mess around with sudo npm.\nUsing Yo\nOnce your permissions are sorted out, all of the steps you took to install and run Yeoman (npm install -g yo) should work just fine.\nYou will have to run nvm use v0.10 each time you start a new terminal session, however. You can get around this by adding a script to your .bashrc that will automatically run this for you at the beginning of each session,\n\nA: You should check this post \nit solves this problem\n", "Q: Change default groups assigned to new users When a new user is created, they are assigned to a set of default groups. How do I change which default groups are assigned?\n\nA: That can change according to the way you are creating the new user.\nIf you are using useradd you can either specify the -G option or use that dirty (very dirty) workaround : rewriting a useradd script.\nThere is maybe a possibility to specify multiple default groups in /etc/default/useradd but I could not find anything in the man or online in the couple of minutes of research I did. So if you really need to do it you can :\nmv /usr/bin/useradd /usr/bin/useradd.default\n\nand now recreate /usr/bin/useradd with the following content\n#!/bin/bash \n\nuseradd.default -G somegroup,otheradditionnalgroup \"$@\"\n\nNow make this executable\n    chmod +x /usr/bin/useradd\nAnd you should be ready to go.\nIt may happen that the useradd command is not located in /usr/bin . You can find it using whereis useradd\nOnce again, this is a dirty hack that will be overwritten by an update. Be careful when doing something like this.\n\nA: Assuming you are using the adduser command to add new users:\nOpen /etc/adduser.conf in your text editor of choice and scroll down until you see #EXTRA_GROUPS.\nUncomment this and the #ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS line beneath it.\nSet the value of EXTRA_GROUPS to whatever you would like the groups to be for new users aside from their own named group.\nSave and start creating new users.\n", "Q: W: GPG error: message in my terminal I get this msg in my terminal\nW: GPG error: https://download.01.org trusty InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A902DDA375E52366\nHow do i get rid of it?

Finally I want to ditch windows completely but after googling I found that to remove win7 from dual boot I've to use live cd/usb, But I don't want to download 700MB+ again. Is there is any other way?\n\nA: Yes, you don't need to download a live CD. You can do it from Ubuntu with Gparted software which can be found in software center. Just go to gparted after you've downloaded it and installed it. Delete the windows partitions which are usually ntfs file systems and go to the command line and run: sudo update-grub or sudo update-burg whichever one you use. It should only show you your linux partitions.\n\nA: This is not a direct solution but to avoid such a big download you can use something like GpartedLive which is very easy to use and wheights 191MB as of today.\nYou can find it there : http://gparted.org/download.php\nAnother way around is to download a very lightweight distribution (50MB) and partition using the utilitaries available in this one (if any I am not sure)\n\nA: Try this link - How to remove Windows from Within Ubuntu.

I am working with apache2+php and other web server apps.\nI have monitor as session connecting to a web server. RAM memory is full.\nBut when disconnecting a session, it does not free the RAM memory.\nI have monitor via free -m, and it show unreleased memory even with no session now connected.\nIs there a solution?\n\nA: You can free up unused memory using this command:\nsudo sync && sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3\n\nThis command synchronize cached data and then writes an OS parameter at runtime, located at /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches. This parameter is read by kernel once, then free up the unused memory. \nBasically, the kernel reserves three sections in cache, that could increase memory usage: \n\n\n*\n\n*pagecache\n\n*dentries \n\n*inodes\n\n\nWriting to this parameter will cause the kernel to drop clean pagecaches, dentries and inodes from RAM, causing that memory to become free. There are three values that can be assigned:\n\n\n*\n\n*vm.drop_caches=1  free pagecaches.\n\n*vm.drop_caches=2  free dentries and inodes.\n\n*vm.drop_caches=3  free pagecaches, dentries and inodes.\n\n\nImportant:\nAfter execution this will return to normal state which means start caching pagecaches, dentries and inodes again. Use it depending on your server configuration and application. \n", "Q: 12.04.5 installed without my knowledge I went right from 12.04.4 to 12.04.5 today, which is alright, but unexpected.

I know usually it's just typing program name, but as you can see in this case it does not work.\n\nA: I dont't know about \"Vmware player\" in particular, but if it is listed under Applications in form of a Symlink > /usr/share/applications/ you could open a preferences-dialog window on that Symlink, using Ctrl+i and use the Command: name in terminal.\nFor instance for Bluetooth Device Setup the command is bluetooth-wizard.\n \n\nA: you can always use the ps command in a bash shell to list all your running programs, if the window-app you need is opened laterly it'll be easy to find at the bottom of the list.\nthere you have it's process number and command running which maybe ellipsised by ps, so look in the /proc file system.\n", "Q: How to add Linuxmint repositories to Ubuntu?

Do I have to make any particular changes to my broadband modem router?\n\nA: AFAICS, your modem is already doing the routing/gateway job between your LAN and the WAN.\nIf you want to set up a gateway on your Linux box, you need to configure and start some software to link the WAN to the LAN (iptables is fine). You probably need to change the configuration of your modem from router to bridge and use pppoe to connect your ISP directly from the Linux server (if your using a DSL connection). Then, the eth0 configuration will be fine and will probably work, BUT, this configuration should be set in ppp configuration, not directly in the interface (ppp will do this for you). For now, configuring eth0 like this makes absolutely no sense if the modem acts like a gateway.\nIt's very difficult to reply more accurately, because we know very little of your LAN and your Internet connection. More of it, this is not one hour job and it can raise many security issues, so nobody can cover the topic in a single forum thread. There are some good networking Howto around. I would strongly suggest you to read them first.\nHTH\n", "Q: Upgrade with ISO - User Name, password, computer name Try a update from 12.04.4 to 14.04.1 by using the ISO (USB) as I had a live session with 14.04.1 to test if it runs on my computer\nUpgrade process detected 12.04 version but later in the install ask me for Name, Username, password and computer name.\nAs I was doing an upgrade I didn't know what to do here. \nWhat is the suggest approach? \n\n\n*\n\n*Type the exact same info as used back in the 12.04 install? \n\n*Just user name and password must match?\n\n\nbtw, I did cancel the wizard as I wanted to start the upgrade from my 12.04 install but the cancel left my 12.04 in a \"half upgrade\" state mess, which require me to do a fresh install. \nUpdate:\nI'm good with this system for now, but for next upgrade (have other system) what is the right approach here.\n\nA: If you have done a fresh install after a mess up, it won't make much difference, your data is probably lost.\nIf it isn't lost and you want it, then I advise that you enter everything the same (although it may not allow the same system name). If it is lost, you need to look into recovering it first. Use the live CD to browse the hard drive and copy it off to an external hard drive or network computer. If not, do a search for data recovery tools.\nIf you don't care about the data that was there, go wild! Enter whatever you want there.

Simply add that keyword to your configuration file and it will no longer hog the port needlessly.\nI would recommend adding nobind to all client configs, since it also avoids potential problems with multihomed / multipathed servers.\n\nA: It says Here that the sample server configuration file is an ideal starting point for an OpenVPN server configuration. It will create a VPN using a virtual TUN network interface (for routing), will listen for client connections on UDP port 1194 (OpenVPN's official port number), and distribute virtual addresses to connecting clients from the 10.8.0.0/24 subnet.\n\nA: It looks like you have the vpn set up through network-manager and that may be the problem.\nI connect through the command line and do not have this issue.\nAlso, check the .ovpn file. You can open it with gedit, nano, or any other text editor and read the configuration and see everything there the way it is set up.\nConnect to openvpn through the commandline and see if the issue still exists, here's how. Just run the following command in an open terminal to connect to the vpn substituting the actual .ovpn file.\nsudo openvpn --config openvpnfile.ovpn\n\nYou can drag and drop or provide the path to the actual .ovpn openvpnfile in the command.\nLeave the terminal open when using the vpn; close the terminal to disconnect.\n", "Q: Terminator terminal fail to launch For some reason my terminator terminal stopped working yesterday.

The fix I have used will hopefully be applicable analogously to your problem, though. Here’s what I did:\nI ran xrandr -q to find out what the current preferred screen resolution is and what other screen resolutions (or rather “mode lines”) are available. In the output, the mode line marked with a + is the current prefferred one. It also matched the currently used one (marked with a *). Here’s the output for me (abbreviated):\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1280 x 1024, maximum 8192 x 8192\nDVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDIN disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-1 connected primary 1280x1024+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 352mm x 264mm\n   1280x1024      85.0*+   75.0     60.0  \n   1920x1440      60.0  \n   …  \n   1600x1200      85.0     75.0     70.0     65.0     60.0  \n   …\n\nTo override the preferred screen resolution, I have created the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the following content:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier \"DVI-1\"\n    Option \"PreferredMode\" \"1600x1200\"\nEndSection\n\nAs you can see, I took both the monitor identifier DVI-1 and the new preferred mode line name 1600x1200 from the xrandr -q output. You should replace these values according to your own setup.\nAfter a logout (or reboot), the new preferred mode line was automatically used for both my display manager and for GNOME Shell. The new (abbreviated) output of xrandr -q was the following:\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1600 x 1200, maximum 8192 x 8192\nDVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDIN disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-1 connected primary 1600x1200+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 352mm x 264mm\n   1600x1200      85.0*+   75.0     70.0     65.0     60.0  \n   1280x1024      85.0 +   75.0     60.0  \n   1920x1440      60.0  \n   …\n\n\nA: This is an alternative for anyone with the same issue.\nThere is a file named \"monitors.xml\" inside the \"~/.config\" folder. The file was write protected on my system so you may need to sudo.\nMake a backup copy of this file.\nModify the resolution specified in The file to the one you desire. Save.\nAfter that just restart the Shell with alt+f2  r. The screen will change resolution to the one specified in the file.\nIn my case it works even after a reboot and now I don't need to use a script to fix the resolution after login in. \n", "Q: Samba not allowing me into the workgroup?

The installation sort of went ok but initially the trackpad didn't work so I ran a script that mostly fixed that. My current issues are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting: it still goes to the chrome \"unknown os\" white screen - I have to press ctrl L - then escape then 1 then wait for 30 secs\nwhile it seems to be searching for something. Then Ubuntu loads up\nfine. Any idea how to fix this?\nSuspend: if I close the lid of the laptop then it doesn't seem to suspend properly. At least when I open the lid the screen appears to\nbe on but the screen is blank with a cursor. Nothing responds on the\nkeyboard and I have to hold the power down to restart it. The suspend\nfrom the top menu has the same issue.\nMoving windows: I don't have a mouse click button so how do I move windows around the screen?\nLauncher bar: I've set mine to auto hide (which it does) but what exactly do you have to do to get it back? I just repeatedly jab the\nmouse at the side of the screen and eventually it pops up.\nI don't mind starting all over again but obviously a quick fix is preferred ;)\nMike\nUbuntu 14.04.1 LTS\nKernel 3.13.0-32-generic\nPS Sorry for so many questions.\n\nA: I've bought C720 as a present and was also messing with Ubuntu for a month, but eventually went back to Chrome OS (I decided to give choice of the OS to the person for whom this Chromebook was intended). So what I found out in the process is this, but haven't actually got to implement it.\nBooting: According to Arch Linux Wiki , there is a way to make SeaBIOS default (which is what actually loads Ubuntu). In other words, making SeaBIOS default should make it go directly into booting ubuntu. That requires removing write-protect screw inside the Chromebook itself (which is pretty easy to open actually). More information here and here\nMouse: There's a shortcut for moving windows in ubuntu : hold alt+left click and drag; speaking of mouses, you probably have heard there is script for rebuilding the kernel, right? Alternative to that is wireless mouse (I've found pretty cheap one , 15$, at Walmart) - that was my solution because I was to lazy to mess with those scripts. \nSuspend: found this forum post just now; according to Pascal148 you have to open  /etc/default/grub, replace the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nwith\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash add_efi_memmap boot=local noresume noswap i915.modeset=1 tpm_tis.force=1 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 nmi_watchdog=panic,lapic\"\n\nand then make sudo update-grub.\nHope this helps. Chromebooks are pretty awesome tech considering the cheapness. I hope to save up and buy one for myself next time, and get ubuntu onto it, but up to this point my learning stops here, so  good luck to you, friend!\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes the Chrome \"OS Verification is off\" screen is NOT removable and is part of the permanent chips inside the laptop. You must press Ctrl+L to boot into Ubuntu or any other OS you installed if you want to stop the Ctrl+L process and skip Directly to the BIOS screen (where you select the boot device, i.e. your hard drive you installed on). Read this question. \n\n*This has been a debated issue for the chromebook for a LONG time there really is no cure for that issue or at least I haven't found one that works. You can try this solution that works for some people, but not me.\n\n*If the mouse you are using is the touchpad built onto the Chromebook (below the keyboard) then you can easily just move the mouse onto the window and use the physical click (pushing down on the touchpad to hear a (CLICK)) and moving the windows around\nif the issue you are having is with a mouse without a click at all I don't have a solution I can give one I'm sorry...\n\n*The launcher bar when set to auto hide will not popup when you just move your mouse to it. You must move your mouse to the middle of the screen and move the mouse onto the launcher then repeat the process which should open the launcher oh plus you can change the launcher hide sensitivity in the same place you enabled auto hide the lower the sensitivity it gets the harder it will be to open the launcher.\nAgain, my apologies for the things I couldn't solve and any typos.\n", "Q: Connecting to the internet and installing MATE via terminal So, I installed Ubuntu 14.04 today, and everytime I log in in the GUI (Unity), my PC crashes. This also happened when I tried Ubuntu 13.10 last year, so I figured, it must be my graphics card. I have a GeForce 6150 SE nForce 430. Strangely this never happened with Ubuntu 11.04 WUBI. I am almost sure my GPU is the problem, so I want to try the MATE desktop.\nNow, I know how to boot into the command line interface, so that isn't a problem. However, I can't seem to connect to the internet. I enter the iwconfig wlan0 essid \"My router\"  key\"My wep password\". This seems to go okay. And when I insert dhclient wlan0 The screen goes to the next line, but I can't enter any commands, it just stays blank forever.\nYou know how it always says \"pcname\"@ubuntu:~# but when I entered the dhclient, that goes away.

LAN is also fine) and then install MATE desktop? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Since you just installed it today why not just install MATE Ubuntu from scratch? Ubuntu MATE Remix\nOther non-Unity options: LXDE, XFCE, Gnome, or Cinnamon\n\nA: I have the EXACT same video card as you. I use a custom (built by myself) LXDE version based on Ubuntu 14.04. It works perfectly on this video card using the default nouveau driver. I've went one step further and I've installed the proprietary nvidia driver version 304.117 (proprietary, tested). Everything works fine. The catch is that LXDE doesn't use any fancy 3D stuff while Unity does and it seems (from your problem description) that Unity + nouveau on GeForce 6150 SE nForce 430 not = love.\nHow the above could help you? You could try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Test run Lubuntu 14.04 LiveCD (Official LXDE Ubuntu) on your machine;\n\n*If 1. is ok then install Lubuntu 14.04;\n\n*Once Lubuntu 14.04 is installed and works ok, install proprietary nvidia driver - I recommend to use Additional Drivers and install the same 304.117 (proprietary, tested);\n\n*Reboot and see if Lubuntu 14.04 + nvidia 304.117 (proprietary, tested) is ok;\n\n*If 4. is ok, finally install the ubuntu-desktop metapackage to get the official Unity Ubuntu installed;\n\n*Logout and re-login - don't forget to select Ubuntu session on login manager screen;\n\n*See if Unity works now - it will be Unity + nvidia driver (not Unity + nouveau driver as you have it now). In case it doesn't works, you still have Lubuntu working that will allow you to try and change stuff via a graphical environment.\nI hope this helps.

Is there a simple way to go about this?\n\nA: After a little bit of research, apparently you can't do that.\nThe sub-interface cannot request another IP address because it is using the same MAC address as the physical interface, and since DHCP requests are by MAC address, you can't get two IPs for the same interface.\nAn answer from SuperUser suggests the following two methods:\n\nMethod 1\nCreate a script that will do something like this (with a subinterface\n  defined on the primary):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Primary interface issues DHCP and gets IP address,\n  \n*macchanger changes MAC address of interface,\n  \n*Sub interface issues DHCP and gets IP address,\n  \n*Revert mac address with macchanger.\n  \n*Kill the DHCP client so that it doesn't automatically run later.\n  \n  \n  Work out the lease time of the IP address you are given, and schedule\n  this script to run again before the lease expires.\nMethod 2\nFor this you will need iproute2 installed.

I have 2 x 3TB hard drives attached to it, but they are configured as RAID 1 at the moment. So the data is being synced on the 2 drives. I would like to configure it as RAID 0 so the 2 drives are separated. Do you have any tips for me?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Well first of all, if you change to RAID 0, you would need to create the array again, which means you would lose all your data. I think it's important to be aware of the risks involved with RAID 0 though. There is an increased risk of array, or drive failure resulting in complete and total data loss on the RAID 0 array.\nIf you are determined to use RAID 0, creating the array depends on what kind of RAID controller you are using, along with the type of server you are using. Assuming the RAID controller is built into the motherboard, it should be possible to enter a RAID configuration menu in the initial stages of the computer booting. Which key you need to press depends on the controller type.\nWhat type of RAID controller does your system use?\nTo see if you have a Hardware RAID, run:\nlspci | grep -i raid\n\nSoftware RAID:\ncat /proc/mdstat\n\nAlso, who is the vendor for your server?\n\nA: Pragmatically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up all your data to an external harddrive.\n\n*Destroy your raid array.\n\n*When you recreate your raid array, use the XFS file system, ESPECIALLY if you are using this for large files. If not XFS, use EXT4. BTRFS is not a performance filesystem, and raid support is still in its infancy. Also, the developers of BTRFS outright say that XFS is the best performer on RAID arrays.\n\n\nSo there is your secret tip; >XFS<\n", "Q: Ubuntu home folder I am using Ubuntu 14.04 & suddenly I am seeing extra files in home directory starting from .filename.

If you are not running the latest chances are the newest version will improve on your current situation, but that does not mean its fully supported.\nHere is latest version as of 09/18/2014 3.3.5 also 2 recomended patches for the release, r6216, and r6237.\n", "Q: Adobe Reader for Linux discontinued I can't find the download for adobe reader any more.

To get this package installed on your machine, you can use apt-get, like this:\nsudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt\n\nIn addition, PHP extensions have to be registered with the correct Server API (SAPI); there is a command-line tool called php5enmod provided by the packager to simplify this process; e.g.\nsudo php5enmod mcrypt\n\nwill add the correct extension=mcrypt.so line to all the relevant php.ini files.\n\nA: Enable the PHP mcrypt module before installing Laravel.\nUsing the command: sudo php5enmod mcrypt\n", "Q: Deleting Lamp and guest account without affecting default or main Root account I'm new to adding accounts and I notice that the programs installed in the regular default/main root account are also installed in the newuser (guest) account I created with root privileges as well.

Any insight will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: You seem like you may be confused about how Ubuntu installs software.\nSoftware installed by Ubuntu (eg, by any of its package managers) will be installed system-wide, for all users.  Ubuntu doesn't have an official concept of installing software for just one user.\nMost software that needs to store user preferences (particularly desktop GUI software) will store its configuration separately for each user, in that user's home directory.  Non-privileged users cannot modify/break software for other users.\nIf you do want to provide separate environments for different users, with different sets of system software installed, you can achieve this using chroot, or even using a more complete virtualisation solution.  But in all likelihood this isn't what you actually need, you just need to provide certain users with the ability to modify the web server files.\nIn which case, you do this with file permissions.  Add the users who you need to be able to modify the web server files to a group with adduser user group, then modify the permissions on the web server files (such as /var/www) to allow group editing and to specify the group.  How to achieve this is probably the scope of another question.\n", "Q: Error installing the noobslab Dark Theme in Ubuntu 14.04 I wanna install the noobslab Dark Theme in Ubuntu 14.04.

I am using Okular for annotating pdf files (e.g. adding comments, drawing lines, circling text, adding images, ...). \nWhat applications do you recommend to read and annotate books in html? For example, this book http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/cl-cookbook-cvsroot.tar.bz2, from http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/\nMy OS is Ubuntu 12.04.\nThanks.\n\nA: Okay I have a funny way of doing this, but since you asked~\nThe answer?\nGoogle Spreadsheets | Check this out:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IEfYx8zclii0ux1nn1flK7aAnPrL0fuVvBqdhOzFPLY/edit#gid=0\nWhy is this good for annotation? Because I can rightclick any box, and add a comment or a note, or I can just make a cell beside it, and comment there. Finding my comments or notes on this is incredibly easy because of the search feature, and because this is google docs, I can access it anywhere, and collaboratively edit.\nNow the question is; How do you get the books onto here?\nSo I actually have two books here; one I ripped from a PDF, and one I took from an HTML. You will need to install Geany to do this efficiently:\nsudo apt-get install geany\n\nThe HTML version is usually pretty easy to work with, as newlines aren't given in the middle of sentences, and you don't have to worry about picking up page numbers. So to get started, I'll use a pdf for an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up your book with a PDF viewer; Any viewer which can select or interpret text. \n\n*Select All:  ctrl + a\n\n*Paste into Geany.\n\n\nNow this is where you need to decide how you want to format your book. As you can see from my example, I dedicate 1 line to every sentence, I prefix a space to every sentence in a paragraph that is not the first sentence, I split the paragraphs by an empty cell, and I append a ↩ to every chapter or section.\nHow do you do this?\na) Manually (The stupid way) \nor \nb) Regular Expressions\n\nI'll give you a short example. \nOnce the text is dumped into geany:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Replace: ctrl + h\n\n*Select checkbox, \"Use Regular Expressions\" and \"Case Sensitive\"\n\n*Search:\n([a-z]+[.\\?!])( [A-Z][a-z ])\nWhat that searches for broadly is the beginning of a new sentence within a paragraph. \nMore Specifically:\n([a-z]+[.\\?!]) - The last word being all lowercase, and ending with a period, exclamation point, or question mark. \n( [A-Z][a-z ]) - The next word is on the same line, starting with a capital, and having a lowercase or space as the next character. \nThe Curved Brackets are used to Capture Text (See tutorial link below)\n\n\n*Replace:\n\\1\\n\\2\n\\1 uses the first capture (), and places a newline \\n between the second capture \\2. The end result is that nearly all my sentences within a paragraph are separated by a newline, with a space prefixed to them. The reason why the newline is important, is that this will make it easy to paste into a spreadsheet.\nNow, there is more work to do than that, and this is just a sample of what you may need to do. \nDon't know regex? Don't worry; it takes about an hour to learn:\nhttp://regexone.com/\nCheers!\n", "Q: Mounting cifs network shares when logging into user account? I have a couple of network shares mounted with cifs in fstab and it works fine when the network is up. However, this is a laptop and often my wi-fi connection isn't up when mounting is triggered by fstab so it fails. Is there a way to have the network shares mounted when I log into my user account instead? \n\nA: You can perform mounts at login by using pam_mount.\nFirst install the required packages with:\nsudo apt-get install cifs-utils libpam-mount\n\nThen edit the \"/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml\" configuration file to declare your mounts.\nSee my post for an example configuration and \"man pam_mount.conf\" for the general syntax.\nIt will mount all shares every time a user logs in (except those already mounted) and unmount them when all users have logged out. This will even enable you to mount password-protected shares, provided your Ubuntu login credentials are the same as the ones on the CIFS server(s).\nHowever, as mentioned in my post, be aware that it will introduce a delay in the login process in case the shares are not accessible.\n", "Q: Strange icon in Unity top menu bar after installing KDE After installing Kubuntu (I am using Ubuntu 14.04), it seems that a lot of fonts disappeared and a strange icon appeared in the top menu bar in Unity.

I have a server with Ubuntu server on it... I installed phpMyAdmin but I made a mistake during installation and I need to start over. I need help uninstalling every single file that came with phpMyAdmin.\nThanks for the answers, your very appreciated. \n\nA: If you installed it from the Ubuntu repositories, it's\nsudo apt-get purge phpmyadmin\n\nThe \"purge\" instead of \"remove\" instructs it to remove its configuration files too, including the configuration it added to Apache's configuration directories.\nYou may be prompted for whether you want to remove its database as well.  This will remove the phpMyAdmin-specific database from your MySQL server.  It won't harm the MySQL server.  In your case, select Yes.  If you are not prompted to do this you will need to remove its database manually.\nIf you installed it manually by extracting files into a web server directory, just delete all those files, and remove its database from your MySQL server assuming you got that far in the installation.\n", "Q: Can't convert flac files to ogg using Sound Converter I have one really annoying problem, when I try to convert a flac file to ogg it returns an error message which says that a \"General stream error was found\" in every file.

So when I look at a simple list, 0, 1, 2, 3,... 8, 9 the characters are sorted in the same order as a numeric sort.\nThe problem somes with multi-digit numbers.  Consider the list: 1, 10, 11, 2, 20\nThis is in fact sorted correctly as characters, but incorrectly as numbers.  In the above list, the first character of the number \"11\" is a \"1\" which comes before a \"2\", just like \"as\" comes before \"b\".\nMany of us would like files and columns of items to be sorted in a numeric sense rather than an ASCII sense - the easiest solution that I have, which is cumbersome, is to know in advance how many files I expect to have, and prepend the numbers with \"0\" to pad out the filenames to a correct length - thus my files would be named 001, 002, 003... 010, 011\nYou may insist that this is a contrived method of ordering the files by name, and I will agree!  However you must also remember that ASCII stands for \"American Standard Code for Information Interchange\" and is nothing more than assigning a digital code to a character.  In asking for a list to be sorted in an ASCII fashion, you are asking for a character sort.\n", "Q: Any player in ubuntu 14.04 unable to play hd videos A HD movie of 1.5 GB size unable to play in any player of ubuntu 14.04.

Now I want to create a .deb package with updated source code and I want to enable user to upgrade the package if it is already installed (and is of previous version, of course), as I won't be changing conf related files, etc. One way I can think of is to write a script which will first check for installed version, and will take actions accordingly (i.e. if installed, just update the source-code, database-migrations, etc. and if not, install the package using dpkg -i <package-name>). I was wondering if there was a way to achieve using dpkg only (something like dpkg upgrade <package-name>) which will handle installation or up-gradation as required.\n\nA: The command you are looking for is indeed dpkg -i. This will install if not installed and upgrade if already installed. dpkg doesn't change user-modified configuration files.  It will ask you what to do about such cases (keep the modifications, discard the modifications, etc.) and it will always keep a backup of whatever you discard (the new config file provided by the package, or the old user-modified file ). Any file installed by the package in /etc/ is considered by dpkg as a configuration file.\n", "Q: When booting, grub errors and goes directly into CLI When I boot up, grub loads, but fires off an error about 6 or 7 times:\nerror: failure reading sector 0xfc from 'hd1'.\nAnd repeat with other sectors.

Perhaps something went wrong during the upgrade, or the upgrade was halted before it was finished (possibly due to a power loss, or running out of disk space?)\nSegmentation fault is a serious error that should not occur in normal situations.\nThis other answer suggested the use of:\naptdcon --fix-install\n\nAnd this may then lead you to have to reinstall some other packages - see that other answer for more details.\n\nAfter seeing your updated information it looks as if this is the samba issue mentioned here and here where upgrading/reinstalling samba might break logins (including sudo).\nIt is described in this bug report.\nSo, you can try to purge all samba related packages then re-install samba (if needed, or just remove it completely).  In particular, you'll need to purge libpam-smbpass.\nBecause you can't use sudo, you'll need to do this via single user mode which Ubuntu makes available through \"recovery mode\" at the boot screen.\nQuoting from that bug report:\n- Reboot and choose the \"recovery mode\" from the boot selection menu\n- Choose \"drop into root shell\" from the recovery menu\n- Execute the command: dpkg --purge libpam-smbpass\n\n", "Q: Getting OpenSSL aes output in hex format I am trying to use openssl's aes implementation.

Installation was of no trouble.\nIt runs very stable (which is to be expected), however I've found that not everything works, most importantly the USB 2.0 ports. They almost always have erratic behaviour, in the sense that if I connect my mouse it is not usable (very jerky movement), and if I connect my Nexus 5 I can't transfer anything over MTP. USB 3.0 works, though.\nI think the above issue already makes it a deal breaker, but among other things, sometimes turning the Touchpad off makes it unusable unless you reboot and you cannot take advantage of the RGB backlit keyboard features without some tinkering. Bluetooth doesn't seem to work properly either.\nWell, this about sums it up for my experiences. Take all this with a grain of salt, perhaps the USB issue is my fault.

Because .bashrc runs when your interactive shell starts, the error message always appears.\nYou may be able to identify the error yourself by looking through your modifications to .bashrc.\n(Otherwise, to identify the specific problem it will be necessary to see the contents of your .bashrc file. You can copy its entire contents to the clipboard and paste it into your question, select it in your question, and format it as code with Ctrl+K. If you've made this file, much, much longer than it usually is, it might be too long to put into your question in its entirety. In that case, you can post it at http://paste.ubuntu.com and edit your question to include a link to the posting.)\nOne possibility is that you may have introduced a space in a path starting with /bin. For example, near the beginning of the default .bashrc file is the code:\n# make less more friendly for non-text input files, see lesspipe(1)\n[ -x /usr/bin/lesspipe ] && eval \"$(SHELL=/bin/sh lesspipe)\"\n\nIf you accidentally put a space after /bin (in SHELL=/bin/sh), this might produce such an error.\nThat is just one example, and not necessarily the most likely one.\n", "Q: Broadcom BCM4313 802.11bgn can connect to WIFI but not to internet I was running Windows 8.1 and very recently switched to UBUNTU.

I just have no idea how to fix it. \nAny help will be much appreciated. \nsudo lshw -C network\n  *-network               \n   description: Wireless interface\n   product: BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter\n   vendor: Broadcom Corporation\n   physical id: 0\n   bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n   logical name: eth1\n   version: 01\n   serial: 2c:d0:5a:fc:d0:08\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n   configuration: broadcast=yes driver=wl0 driverversion=6.30.223.141 (r415941) ip=192.168.2.103 latency=0 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11abg\n   resources: irq:17 memory:e4100000-e4103fff\n\niwconfig\nwwan0     no wireless extensions.\n\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\neth1      IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:\"Our-Wifi-Name\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.452 GHz  Access Point: 44:94:FC:A1:C4:B1   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n\nusb0      no wireless extensions.\n\n\nA: Try this :\nIn your terminal (CTRL + ALT + T) \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source bcmwl-modaliases\n\n\nA: I believe that bcmwl-kernel-source, which you already have installed, is incorrect for your device.

Laptop is too hot I have HP ProBook 4540s with CPU Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3110M and GPU AMD Radeon HD 7650M and Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000. (Intel® Ivybridge Mobile also.)\nOK, the problem is that the laptop is getting very hot when using Ubuntu compared to when using Windows. Also, the battery drains faster compared to Windows.\nSo, how do I get rid of this problem? \nBTW: Recently I managed to fix the brightness control problem on this laptop, but turning down the brightness of the screen doesn't help much. I used the method involving:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf\n\n(It took me months to find this method.)\nRunning Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x64.\nMy Windows is Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64, working fine.\nAlso, a while back I had Windows 8.1 Enterprise x64 installed there also.

You notebook has 2 video cards, with the idea that slow but cool HD400 works by default, switching to hot and powerful one when needed. (which one do you have by the way? They vary in this model). In Linux, this does not work out of the box, and you always have both video cards on, resulting in maximum heat. If you are OK to go without big GPU, you can just disable bigger video card altogether. Intel HD4000 is a rather tough guy itself - it can handle HD video and all 2010 games quite well. Otherwise, search for instruction on how to tweak NVIDIA Optimus if you have NVIDIA, or PowerXPress if you have Radeon.

Also my user, juan, is the owner of both the folder and btsync. \nThis only seems to happen with btsync and not with other programs. I've tried re-downloading btsync. Last bit of, maybe, relevant info: a while back another user attempted (but messed up) to install btsync using apt-get which resulted not on btsync being installed, but this package which is not written by the same people and builds on btsync. I attempted to remove it as best as I could using \njuan@server:~/.btsync$ sudo apt-get purge btsync*\njuan@server:~/.btsync$ sudo apt-get --purge autoremove\n\nbut maybe something remains lingering somewhere.

But what about the underlying files and folders?\nVerify that they are right or just remove the .btsync folder so that btsync can create a new one when you start it\nAnother possibility is be that your home partition is a different mount point \nfrom your / drive and mounted with the noexec flag. Which denies executing files on it.\nYou can verify this with the mount command that will list your mount points and the mount flags.  \n\nA: where ever you are running this from hit ctl + h and show your hidden files. Find the folder called \".sync\" remove this folder. If you have run btsync as root you may need to use the terminal and delete this folder with root permissions \nsudo rm .sync/ -r\n\nnow move the btsync file you downloaded to your home folder. you shouldn't need to have this under the root folder. Run this again with the terminal in a normal user session in your home folder.\nuser@system:~$ ./btsync\nthis will recreate the \".sync\" folder this time in your home directory and you will have to go back and remake all your shared keys.\nnow make sure you have access to all the directories you are trying to sync. Using the root account can screw up permissions with the other devices trying to sync files. \nNote: btsync does not sync the folder it is running in. Once you run this file nothing will happen on it own you need to open a web browser and go to the local web site this application is hosting on your PC\nEnter this in your broswer's URL bar:\n127.0.0.1:8888/gui/\nfrom here you can create the sync keys for each folder and select the folders you want to have synced. If this is a laptop and you take this PC to a public network I highly advise you password protect the local web site this can be done during the initial setup and make sure to turn the firewall on.\nA graphical firewall manager is gufw search for it in the ubuntu software center and click the switch to enable it. If someone were to access the web panel for btsync they could steal your data\nI can also recommend not syncing your entire home folder with another Ubuntu PC as this can cause issues with your system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 stuck on shutdown When I try to shut down my computer, it hangs at the shutdown screen and these are the only lines I can see:\nwait-for-state stop/waiting\nStoping GNUstep distributed object mapper: gdomap.\n* Stopping rsync daemon rsync [ OK ]\n* Stopping Speech Dispatcher speech-dispatcher [ OK ]\n\nAnd thats all. \nI'm using gnome 3.10 (had 3.12 but downgraded because of some problems) if it has something to do with that. \nRebooting the computer works; it doesn't hang.\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't shutdown properly or hangs at shutdown ?\nIssue faced While installing Ubunutu 14.04 in Dell XPS 15Z Laptop\nOpen the file /etc/default/grub with text editor of your choice, and with admin privillege.

I had to use sudo shutdown -h 0 (so with -h) to make it work.\nIf I forget -h, the system hangs with me potentially far away, so I made an alias for it (normally not a good idea to alias builtin commands but I feel this is important).\nalias sudo='sudo '  # note the space, that's what makes sudo recognize aliasses\nalias shutdown='shutdown -h'\n\n\nA: I had the same issue with the shutdown on Ubuntu (15.10 and 16.10). With debug enabled in GRUB I could see that the laptop crashed right after 'Reached target Shutdown'\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"debug\"\n\nI also tried various GRUB options and even to create a service that powers off the USB.\nIf you have USB 3.0 you could try to disable them from BIOS (I could not do that on my ASUS X540SA due to few settings in BIOS)\nFor me, the solution was to upgrade the kernel.\nI used 4.5.3 on Ubuntu 15.10 (anything greater than this will crash the OS after login)\nAnd 4.7 RC3 works on Ubuntu 16.04.\nPreviously I had Linux Mint 17 installed and it didn't have issues on rebooting/shutdown.\n\nA: I had the same thing happen to me on my ASUS laptop and tried every method to counter it under the sun. The one that got the furthest was updating the kernel to 4.2.3, so if you want to give that a try then click here and follow the instructions.\nFailing that, you can always fall back on SysRq, which is what I did. If you intend to use SysRq then really you should follow the REISUB steps, but really, if you need to do it often like I did, then all but B (or O in our case) don't really matter.\nHold down the Alt+Prt Sc/SysRq+Shift keys and type in REISUO, making sure to wait about 5-10 seconds between each one and your computer will shut down.\nExplanation:\n R - Forces capturing of the keyboard\n E - Terminates all processes\n I - Kills all processes\n S - Syncs all mounted drives\n U - Remounts all drives in read-only mode\n\nThen either:\n B - Reboots the system\n O - Shuts down the system\n\nIt's because of the long wait needed between each entry that I cut down on the unnecessary ones; plus, most are only needed if you lose control over the system. So if you try to shut down manually and it freezes, as it is want to do, follow REISUO ... otherwise just use O.\n(Remember that it won't happen right away, so don't keep pressing it to make it work faster; just be patient).\nAs an additional note: some computers may use different key combinations, such as Alt+Fn+Prt Sc/SysRq. There are more details here on the Wikipedia page with alternate patterns you can try if the original doesn't work.\nHope this all helps.\n\nA: I had this very same problem and nothing suggested was working. I finally figured out that the system was set to boot in using LEGACY and not UEFI Secure. Once I changed it to UEFI it worked perfectly!\n\nA: I had the very same problem and it took me 3 days to solve it.\nI am using a Lenovo B50-10. The installation  of Ubuntu 14.04 did not cause any problems until I wanted to restart the computer to finish the installation progress. The display turned black and the computer wouldn't do anything. Soon I figured out that it would't shut down either. The hard drive turned off but the display froze showing the ubuntu logo with the dots.\nSo I tried modifying the boot options by editing the\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nline and applying the solutions that are mentioned in the answers above.\nThen I figured out that I installed Ubuntu in the legacy mode and this may be a reason. So I changed the BIOS mode to UEFI and installed it in the UEFI mode. Surprisingly I now could stop Ubuntu from hanging on shutdown/resart by editing\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi=noirq quiet splash\"\n\nUnfortunately this modification caused that I had no wifi connection anymore. So it wasn't a solution really and I considered updating the BIOS and the kernel. But without a Windows product key and bloody linux beginner as I am I didn't know how.\nBut finally I solved the problem by applying this solution:\nGo to bios and change \"OS Optimized Defaults\" and set it to \"Enabled\".\nThen hit \"Load default settings\".\nThis was the solution that worked for me. So I didn't need to update the firmware or the kernel.\n\nA: I still have the same problem, despite following the advices, \nHere is the output of     \n\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi=force apm=power_off\"\n#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=bios\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nAnd output of \n\nsudo gedit /etc/modules\n\nlp\nrtc\napm power_off=1\n\nThanks, \n", "Q: recovery ntfs file from previuse partitions Yesterday I installed Ubuntu 14.04, unfortunately I used the whole HDD and Ubuntu removed everything even Windows 7 from my HDD.\nCan I retrieve my files?\n\nA: Possibly, but very unlikely.

If yes, there is a lot of disk recovery software for Windows (just don't install Windows on that disk again)\nThe only exception is if you had a separate disk letter in Windows for your data and C disk was larger that the amount of files Ubuntu did write.

From the man page:\n\nNAME\n   restorepalette - set the color palette for textmode.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n   restorepalette [filename]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n   restorepalette  without  arguments  sets the standard VGA palette. This\n   can be useful if it is somehow messed up.\n\n   With a filename argument a custom palette can be loaded (feature  added\n   by Charles Blake <chuckb@alice.wonderland.caltech.edu>).\n\n   This  allow  a  user  to  set up a file that looks like this one (These\n   color map definitions are the same as the default VGA ones.   Alter  to\n   suite  personal  tastes).  The  first column contains the number of the\n   color to set, then follow three integers in range 0  -  63  (lowest  to\n   highest intensity) for red, green, blue.\n\n           0  0  0  0   # black\n           1  0  0 42   # blue\n           2  0 42  0   # green\n           3  0 42 42   # cyan\n           4 42  0  0   # red\n           5 42  0 42   # magenta\n           6 42 21  0   # brown\n           7 42 42 42   # white\n           8 21 21 21   # bright black\n           9 21 21 63   # bright blue\n          10 21 63 21   # bright green\n          11 21 63 63   # bright cyan\n          12 63 21 21   # bright red\n          13 63 21 63   # bright magenta\n          14 63 63 21   # bright brown\n          15 63 63 63   # bright white\n\n   The  inline  comments  are  the only kind of allowed, as I use a little\n   fscanf(3) trick to get them. Blank lines are ok, but not  pure  comment\n   lines. See the comments in my code, also.\n\n   This allows people to set up custom palettes for use in virtual console\n   text modes. I use it all the time. When combined  with  a  color-syntax\n   editor  like jed-0.97+ or color-ls, etc., being able to choose your own\n   text-mode palette is quite a bonus.

Having a script in these directory doesn't mean that they are going to start.\nFor the script in /etc/init.d, there should be a link in one of the /etc/rc*.d directories to start or stop them (symbolic link) managed by the update-rc.d tool.\nServices in these directories are usually started / stopped / restarted by the sudo service <service name> <action> command.\nFor the scripts in /etc/init, these are part of the new boot mechanism offered by upstart. The file in the /etc/init directory contains information about when and how to start and stop the service they offer.\nServices in this directory are usually started / stopped / restarted by sudo <action> <service name>.\n\n*Of course, less services to start means less time to wait during boot. But take care of not disabling services needed by your system to function properly (like udev, dbus, ...)\n\n*For services started from /etc/init.d, the startup script should implement in it various check to report that the service is well started or not. Usually this translate by a line saying \" started\" or \" not started\" or some other error message. This appears at the console and should also be logged into /var/log/boot.log.\nFor services started by upstart (using /etc/init directory), the upstart process itself provides a way to automatically restart services that may fail, manage the dependencies between them (start service1 prior to service2 if service2 needs service1 to start / function).\n\nA: sudo apt-get install bum\n\nBum is a boot up manager,it allows u to detect and manipulate the daemons and processes which start at boot up.\n", "Q: Which port and ip addresses are used while installing new ubuntu system As we know that when, we install the new Ubuntu system and if we are connected to the internet then it can fetches packages from Ubuntu repository.\nSo I have question which port and ip address is used while fetching those packages.\n\nA: You may view which servers will be queried by taking a look at /etc/apt/sources.list.  Your computer will query a DNS server (port 53) for each of these domain names.  After the DNS has been resolved, your computer will access via whatever protocol is mentioned in the sources.list file.  Typically, this is HTTP (port 80).\nBy default, your computer will query the servers, and then you will be redirected to another mirror (based on round-robin or possibly geo-location) and your computer will download the latest information.\nWhen you download information from the servers, or you download packages from the servers, all the data downloaded is verified using GPG/PGP verification.

I have recently encountered a problem printing .pdf files containing transparent elements. I first noticed it when printing a document created with LaTeX that included embedded .png images with alpha channels and embedded .pdf figures with transparent elements. The document would look fine on the screen but when printed the pages containing embedded graphics would appear to be bitmapped at a low resolution.\nI later found this would also occur when printing some of the .pdf figures individually so the problem is not specifically to do with LaTeX. I also found that the documents will generally print OK with Adobe Reader in Linux, but they take a very long time to print. The documents also appear to print OK with Adobe Reader in Windows. This suggests the problem lies with the Evince (the default .pdf viewer) or something in the printing sub-system between document and printer. I speculate that Adobe Reader in Linux is unaffected by the problem because it rasterizes the page images itself at an acceptable resolution or otherwise communicates with the printer differently. Unfortunately I don't know enough about Ubuntu's print sub-system to locate the source of the problem but it definitely seems like a bug.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04, Evince Document Viewer 3.4.0 using poppler/cairo (0.18.4) and CUPS 1.5.3\nThere are a number of related questions but the following two are the most relevant:\nFlattening PDF Transparency - The best answer here is to use Acrobat Professional in Windows to flatten the transparency, but I don't have easy access to this software.\nWhy do some vector graphics included into a document force rasterization of the whole page and subsequently ruin the look of the text in cups? - The best answer here is to use ghostscript to convert the .pdf to a version that doesn't support transparency effects, but this simply rasterizes the file rather than flattening the transparency.\nNone of the answers to these questions really get to the root of the problem, i.e. how come the files print OK in Adobe Reader in Windows (and in Linux, albeit slowly) but not with the default .pdf viewer Evince?\nMy own workaround is simply to ensure there are no transparent elements in the .pdf figures in the first place. Where transparent effects are essential I save the figures as .png at a sufficiently high resolution for printing. If necessary any .png alpha channels can be removed using Gimp. I have found no way to flatten a .pdf in Linux without rasterizing it.\nCan anyone suggest a resolution or at least a better workaround?\n\nA: Try to use Okular.\nSay if it helped.\nYou can use apt install okular\n\nA: Another work-around I found is to convert these PDFs to a 600 DPI .djvu file:\npdf2djvu -d 600 file.pdf > printable.djvu\n\nOf course, it's not a PDF anymore, but these files can still be opened by Evince or Okular and Adobe Acrobat isn't required.\nMore details can be found at https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/printing-hard-to-print-pdfs-on-linux/.\n\nA: A solution to print such PDFs – those that contain (partial) transparency – I found easy and useful is, to print using PDFium, which afaiu does its own rastering before printing and which is the PDF viewer built in to Chrome and many other Chromium based browsers such as Opera, Vivaldi, …\n", "Q: Dual boot extend partition I am really new to ubuntu, and I wanted to extend my dual boot Ubuntu partition, but there is no option to which I can extend it.\nI have run gparted, then I swapoff the linux-swap.

You can start TBB from this directory and use the new version. There is no other update mechanism.\nSometimes it also works to extract the new archive over the old directory, but it is not guaranteed that this will work.\nIf you extract the archive into a new directory you'll loose bookmarks and other information. So you might want to export your bookmarks from the old TBB and import it to the new one. Furthermore you should copy the file Data/Tor/state. It contains information about your Tor guard nodes. There was Q&A at Tor.SE why this should be done. The question How do I keep my Tor Browser Bundle current? provides also some insights.\nA nice way to use always the latest version is the torbrowser-launcher. When you start the software it checks for new versions of TBB and updates it in a secure way. IF there is no update, it justs starts the currently installed TBB.\n\nA: It's easy just:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y --only-upgrade <BROWSERNAME>\n\n", "Q: How can I get hunspell to use Australian English?

If it detects a lower wattage then it will cap your processor at around half the power.\nIf you frequently use a smaller power adaptor (smaller = less wattage = lighter to carry (180w weighs over 1kg)) - then you can simply go into your bios settings > Performance > Intel Speed-Step > Disable.\nPlease note - while the smaller power adapter will power your machine it will probably struggle to charge your battery while the machine is on !\n", "Q: Should I format my hard drive when upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04?

First of all, let us make an xmodmap script at ~/.Xmodmap. I understand you want the right alt to function as a super key. I suggest this:\nclear mod1\nclear mod4\n\n!Make right alt to look like Super_R\n!I'm assuming your right alt has keycode 108, you can check using xev\nkeycode 108 = Super_R NoSymbol Super_R\n\n!Add the Super_L and Super_R keys to the modifier mod4\nadd mod4 = Super_L Super_R\n\nYour other alt key and super keys may now be messed up, but you can assign them to anything you want analogously. (If you don't want to change them at all, use xev to see what they did originally and assign them to that.) Just put all clears together first, then the assignings of keycodes to key names, then finally the assignings of key names to modifiers, and I think it should work.\nNormally, ~/.Xmodmap should be executed automatically on login, but if not, you can try adding a line\nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\nor\nsleep 4 && xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap &\n\nto ~/.bash_profile.\n", "Q: DHCP leases flash of Docker I've docker container, it uses internal DHCP to assign the IP to its Network Interface.\nEach time I stop and run the container again, the new IP is assigned, ex: 172.17.0.2, 172.17.0.3, 172.17.0.4 etc\nOnce I restart computer, the DHCP starts to assign IP from the beginning - 172.17.0.2\nIs there any way to flash the current DHCP cache (leases) to always have 172.17.0.2 IP assigned when I run a container again without restarting PC?\n\nA: I just found the easiest way to release the docker's DHCP cache by just restarting docker ex:\nsudo service docker restart\n\nIt is not the same as only DHCP release, but it does what I need.\n", "Q: The pernicious USB-stick stall problem. Is it fixed in 14.04? There's a known bug in Ubuntu that causes the system to freeze when copying files to a external hard drive (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/107703/56755 and \nhttp://lwn.net/Articles/572911/). I can testify that this bug is still a problem in 13.10.\nIs this issue fixed in version 14.04, or 14.04.1?\n\nA: There is a bug report, which was closed as INVALID.\nThe patch to fix this (at least, that's what I think it does from a quick scan of the mailing list discussion) was originally submitted in November. However, it has only entered the linux-next tree today. And from what I understand of the linux-next tree, code merged in to it are aimed at the next release. So, no, the bug hasn't been fixed yet, but will be (hopefully soon).\n", "Q: exFAT vs NTFS. Is exFAT stable enough in 14.04? Is exFAT stable enough in Ubuntu 14.04?\nI have an external usb hard drive that I need to access from Windows and Ubuntu. Should I use exFAT or NTFS? \nIf I only were using Windows PCs, I would go for exFAT. But now that I need to access the drive from Ubuntu too, I am considering NTFS because it has a longer support in that system.\nCan someone post a list of cons and pros?\n\nA: \nIs exFAT stable enough in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nWell it is in use fairly widely and I myself have not seen users with problems where they are loosing data due to bugs in the exfat/fuse implementation. \nWith all filesystems that are not native to Linux: be careful when using them and always keep a copy of Windows on your system (even when not using it: it is safer to shrink the Windows system to a bare minimal and edit grub config to skip asking for what OS to start then to remove it completely. There will come a time where the partition is un-mountable from Linux and you will need a Windows tool to fix it).\nJust for 1 reason only I would stick with NTFS: exfat is only available as a personal archive and ntfs is in the repositories. So it seems Canonical does not deem it good enough to include in the repositories yet (yet since it is included in Debian so I would expect it to be included too in 14.10) \n\nA: You're better of with NTFS has it has better support on the Linux side.\nEven more, this question has been covered in our forum here and here for example. \n", "Q: Installing Xubuntu. Should I use repositories or install directly from the xubuntu disc image? I am considering two options for installing Xubuntu 14.04.1 on my PC. I can install Ubuntu using this disc image, and then use the repositories to install the Xubuntu desktop.\nThe other option is to install Xubuntu using this disc image directly.\nWhat are the differences between these two paths to getting the Xubuntu desktop on my PC? What are the pros and cons?\n\nA: You're better off with instaling Xubuntu. Althoug they share the same base (Ubuntu), Xubuntu is more clean and you'll get only the packages you need.\nFor example:\n1 - Installing Ubuntu and then installing XFCE (Xubuntu), you'll end up with a lot of packages and customizations that you don't want or need.\n2 - Installing Xubuntu will get you a clean, strimmed version of Xubuntu, wich is what you need. \n3 - There's a team dedicated to Xubuntu that's dedicated to this customized distro, and therefore you will have a space more dedicated for the DE you want.\nIf later you decide do install something else (Gnome, Unity, etc) you still can do it, because Xubuntu is Ubuntu.\n\nA: I would suggest using the image found on Xubuntu's site. The main different between the two flavors is the desktop environment, and accessory program selection. Xubuntu uses a lightweight desktop environment called Xcfe and Ubuntu uses Unity. In addition, all flavors of Ubuntu use the same repository for downloading updates, so the same set of packages is available regardless of which flavor you have installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu (LXDE Desktop)\n\n*Xubuntu (Xcfe Desktop)\n\n*About Unity\n\nA: There seems to be confusion about Xubuntu vs Lubuntu. Both of these are official Ubuntu variations, so after the install is complete, you will be using the same Ubuntu repositories as if you installed Ubuntu then used the repositories to install another desktop environment.\nThe difference is that:\nXubuntu uses XFCE - http://xubuntu.org/\nLubuntu uses LXDE - http://lubuntu.net/\nWhen you install Xubuntu or Lubuntu, you don't have to deal with resetting the default environment, as you would if you installed through the repositories.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on second hard drive without CD/DVD I'm trying to install Ubuntu but I don't have a CD/DVD burner or large flash drive. I do have access to a second computer and I've hooked up the hard drive to it. How can I install Ubuntu on that hard drive? It seems that this should be easy but I can't find a way to do it.\n\nA: I've worked out some way which might work for you:\nOn your Vista computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install UNetBootin\n\n*Download a Super GRUB2 Disk ISO file.

I feel comfortable and confident in troubleshooting most things, and have installed Ubuntu on an older laptop of mine before about a year ago. I want to switch due to my most recent niche for developing and Linux. I'm worried I'll have driver issues or some freak error resulting in a hard-brick; a $2,000 paperweight. I'd follow all the A-Z backups and basic precautionary steps of course.\nWhat's the worst that could happen?\n\nManufacturer:  Maingear Computers\n  Memory:    16.0 GB RAM\n  GPU:    GeForce GTX 770M\n  CPU:    Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4800MQ CPU @ 2.70GHz\n  Graphics:   Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600\n  Network Adapters:\n  Killer Wireless-N 1202 (2.4GHz and 5GHz)\n  Killer e2200 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller\n\n\n\nA: \nor some freak error resulting in a hard-brick\n\nThat is not going to happen due to -installation-. That's more like to happen when hardware fails or you start flashing the bios. If anything goes wrong during installation all you did was format the disk. \n\ndriver issues \n\nThat can happen. 2 possible concerns: \n\n\n*\n\n*your videocard. Find out make and model and google it to see if there is a lot of trouble. General rule of thumb: Intel works. nVidia and AMD work BUT stay away from the newest models. Support for videocards lags a few months behind. If this fails it will fail with the 1st boot after installation and its will be a show-stopper for the newbie Ubuntu user... debugging a failed videocard during 1st boot is not going to be easy. \n\n*wireless card if there is one. Check for the chipset and google for it. Make sure you get it working during the LIVE dvd sesssion (prior to install). If it works it will work after install. A problem with wireless is not a big deal: connect wired and it will get you to the web and you can then fix the wireless.\nAll other hardware should work out of the box.\n\nA: The worst that could happen is you wont like Ubuntu :)\nIn all seriousness, the worst that could happen is you may spend some time getting your graphics drivers installed (if that) or you need update them. Network card drivers as well but Ubuntu has really great driver support so all of your hardware should be detected out of the box. On the variety of machines I've installed Ubuntu on, all the hardware was detected just fine. \nIf you're really concerned take a look at this hardware compatibility list for more information.\nHardwareSupport | Ubuntu Wiki\n\nA: Well, I guess the scariest thing that could happen could be one of these 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*brick your laptop: http://www.pcworld.com/article/2026807/booting-linux-via-uefi-can-brick-some-samsung-laptops.html\n\n*unwanted wipe out of your existing Windows OS - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1265192\n\nA: Go ahead.

I am starting to think that it is due to some hardware problem but it seems unlikely, since it was working just fine a couple of hours earlier.\nThank you!\n\nA: If that is an Asus Seashell eee-pc, check that you have wireless enabled on your BIOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press F2 at boot\n\n*Select Advanced\n\n*Select Onboard Device Configuration\n\n*Set Onboard WLAN Disabled to Enabled\nFor some reason, it was disabled for me, and that didn't prevent me from connecting to wireless until now.\n\nA: I suggest you experimentally unload asus-wmi:\nsudo modprobe -r asus-wmi\nsudo rfkill unblock all\n\nNow does your wireless work? If so, let's blacklist the module:\nsudo -i\necho \"blacklist asus-wmi\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nexit\n\n\nA: Just look for your wifi key on your keyboard (near the function keys).\nMine was PrtScr (Hit Fn + PrtScr to turn it on).\nIf you can't find it you can also attach a keyboard which has the wifi key to your laptop.\n\n\nA: I'm using an ASUS PC which had the same issue, solved by adding this to /etc/modprob.d/blacklist.conf:\nblacklist wmi\nblacklist asus-wmi\nblacklist asus-nb-wmi\nblacklist asus-nb-wmi\nblacklist asus_nb_wmi\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I had the same problem in a Dell Inspiron laptop (persisted with WLAN set to Enabled in BIOS), which I solved as follows:\nIn the BIOS, in Wireless section, there is another option that controls what is enabled/disabled via keyboard/software, with options {none, WLAN only, Bluetooth only, both}. Setting this option to 'none' solved the problem (obviously this prevents any kernel module from disabling the WLAN via software, so you do not have to bother resolving which module does this and blacklisting it).\n", "Q: Restore Ubuntu's default UI I recently switched over to Ubuntu 13.04, I used it on my Laptop it worked pretty great, then I updated it to 13.10 then further updated it to 14.04.\nWhile upgrading to 14.04, my UI suddenly crashed - I don't know why.

It is possible to reset root password using live CD or USB using chroot which would mean that if someone stole my laptop or held it for sometime, he could reset my user password and get all my information. \nIf it is possible then how secure is ubuntu and how secure are my files and information? \nEven BIOS firmware can be flashed in case I protect it with password.\n\nA: This is actually OS independent. If an attacker has physical access to your machine, then that machine is compromised. Period. This has nothing to do with what operating system you are using, it is true for all of them. \nThe only way to protect yourself from that (and it is also imperfect) is to encrypt your data. User passwords fail miserably since, as you point out, it is trivial to boot into a different system. When that happens, your data is under the control of this other OS, and the user passwords of your original system are completely irrelevant. \n", "Q: How do I change the shortcuts in mplayer? I want to change the shortcuts in mplayer. More specifically, I want when I press the RIGHT button to go to the next song in the playlist instead.

I am the root on my laptop, so I put in my own password, but it said that the password was wrong. Also, that is the only password that exists on my laptop (no other accounts). What should I do?\n\nA: ZIP archives can be encrypted. You will need either to know a decription password specific to the archive you downloaded or you'll need a password-guessing software fcrackzip that will simply try every possible password. The software is in Ubuntu repositories. \n\nA: the zip file is password protected by his creator, so if you don't know it, you can't open the archive\n\nA: If you downloaded the .Zip File from a external source like maybe a You Tuber Gave you a link they might have put a lock on the ZIP file itself.\nSo you need the password to the zip file and not your computer password.\n", "Q: How to get rid of this error \nThe Required plugins could not be found\nVideos requires to install plugins to play files of the following types:\n•  MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3) decoder\n•  MPEG-4 Video decoder\n\nI tried manually installing the same plugins, but it didn't do anything.\nCan someone please help?\n\nA: Did you do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras?

(Note that the data moving in the first step can be done while booted into Ubuntu.)\nAlso, you may get GRUB boot errors after changing your partition table. To fix this, you'll need to run Boot-Repair from your live CD/USB.\n", "Q: Changes to $PATH won't save after closing the terminal session I downloaded the latest version of Scala and saved it to /opt folder.

(why? because it will be easier to run, maintain and distribute)\nMost likely, the solution will use dbus, but I might be mistaken.\n(By the way, I'm and advanced user and former Gentoo user, feel free to spit out technical details!)\n\nSolutions that require root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Autorun a script after I plugged or unplugged a USB device\n\n*http://granjow.net/udev-rules.html\n\n*http://hg.dfrank.ru/linux/my-udev-notify (from this question/answer)\n\n\nSeemingly outdated solutions that don't need root:\n\n\n*\n\n*This answer suggested cuttlefish, but the latest version is from 2012-08-24.\n\n*This thread suggested halevt, but the latest version is from 2010-02-18.\n\n*This question/answer points to this tutorial that has C++ source-code using the outdated and deprecated HAL.\n\n\nA: The \"How can I listen for 'usb device inserted' events in Linux, in Python?\" question has a very short sample Python script using pyudev. That script can easily detect when a device is connected or disconnected, by monitoring the device-event from the usb subsystem.\nWhat's more, pyudev is pure-python implementation and is available on both Python 2 and Python 3.\nBased on that sample code, I've written auto_exec_xinput_xset_upon_usb_device_change.py (see also the most recent version). Works on both Python 2 and Python 3.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport functools\nimport os.path\nimport pyudev\nimport subprocess\n\n\ndef main():\n    BASE_PATH = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n    path = functools.partial(os.path.join, BASE_PATH)\n    call = lambda x, *args: subprocess.call([path(x)] + list(args))\n\n    context = pyudev.Context()\n    monitor = pyudev.Monitor.from_netlink(context)\n    monitor.filter_by(subsystem='usb')  # Remove this line to listen for all devices.\n    monitor.start()\n\n    for device in iter(monitor.poll, None):\n        # I can add more logic here, to run only certain kinds of devices are plugged.\n        call('foobar.sh')\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 hangs every minute Every minute I get a second or so of minor lag.

Any answers or further debugging suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\nP.S. Although my question seems to be a duplicate of this question, no answers were ever given in that thread, and the asker closed it because updating to 13.10 fixed the problem for him/her.\n\nA: I have variety installed, which is a wallpaper switcher. One of the options in the preferences was to have a large digital clock in the lower right corner of the desktop. Disabling this feature fixed my problem.\nThe iowait I was getting every minute must have been variety opening the wallpaper file and writing the new clock to it. The reason iowait showed the culprit to be nautilus is because nautilus manages the desktop and wallpaper in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Black Screen after grub - Ubuntu Server 14.04.4 I have a Fit-PC3 (specs here), but when I want to install Ubuntu Server (by choosing the first option given on the grub menu), a black screen appears only.\nI know this is a common issue, and I know I have to edit some things in the commands before the boot, but nothing changed.\nSo, here's what I did :\n\n\n*\n\n*nomodeset on the boot command (after quiet) -> Nothing\n\n*acpi=off on the boot command (after quiet) -> Nothing\n\n*Both of them -> Nothing\n\n*Disabled EFI mode ( = not even boots the USB drive) -> Nothing\n\n\nIs there anything I forgot ?\nThanks.\n\nA: Well...

So, their interaction with CL is very limited.  \n\nA: You can install the network-manager-openvpn-gnome package to enable OpenVpn GUI in Ubuntu or other linuxes that have network-manager:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n\n\nA: I know this is not the GUI method but openvpn couldn't be any more simple or elementary as far as the commandline goes and really does not need a GUI. The command to start an openvpn session is as follows:\nsudo openvpn --config\n\nand then drag and drop the \".ovpn\" file into the terminal to complete the command so it should look something like this example:\nsudo openvpn --config '/home/jglerner/Desktop/vpnbook-us1-tcp443.ovpn'\n\npress enter, enter your password for sudo, enter your vpn username, then your vpn password and you're good to go.\nUsers can minimize the open terminal if they don't want to look at it while it's running. Plus, it might give your \"non linux pals\" a bit of commandline confidence when they see how easy something like this can be.\nExample .ovpn file used in this example can be downloaded from here http://www.vpnbook.com/ if you want to check it out and see how it works. Just download the certificate bundle and extract the zip file. There are two TCP and two UDP servers to choose from. The username is \"freevpnme\" and the password is listed on the download page, however, the password changes day to day to prevent abuse and spam but the cert. files stay the same.\n\nA: Here's how I did this in ubuntu 16.04.\nI used Network Manager -- access this via right-click on the little \"networking icon\" in the system tray, e.g.:\n\nI already had Network Manager, but I needed to install OpenVPN and two extensions for Network Manager:\nsudo apt-get install openvpn  \nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn  \nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome  \n\nEven if you're not running Gnome, you can install the Gnome extension for OpenVPN -- it will run just fine inside Unity, for example, and it's needed for the following setup:\nRight-click Network Manager in the System Tray, select Edit:\n\nclick Add:\n\nIn the dropdown, select to import the vpn config:\n\nSelect the .ovpn config file from your file system:\n\nOnce this is setup, right-click on Network Manager > VPN Connections and select the connection to connect.

The dock is using a single DisplayPort connection to provide both monitors over a single channel. To do this, it is using Multi-Stream Transport (MST), which is not yet well supported in Linux and Xorg.\nUntil the Hardware Enablement Stack for 14.04 becomes available after 14.10 is released, you won't be able to use the feature with the standard kernel and Xorg packages.\nOptions until a kernel and Xorg are available via normal channels on 14.04 that include this support, are to use a PPA which contains the back-ports of the necessary versions (assuming that the hardware you have is supported in the newer versions already), or compile your own packages.\n", "Q: Nvidia low graphics mode I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS on a Asus A53SV with Nvidia 540M and Intel Sandy Bridge i7.

Check the \"history\" tab in the software center and downgrade all the intel changes from 1.0.5 -> 1.0.6.\nAs far as I can tell, there are two possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The intel update installs a package called i915-3.15-3.13-dkms, which I guess is a backport of the Intel graphics kernel module in 3.15 to the ubuntu 3.13 kernel. This might be incompatible with the Nvidia kernel module.\n\n*A bug in the intel driver.\n\n\nA: My solution was to re-install Ubuntu, so I close my own question.\n", "Q: Grub mismatched names rescue mode My VirtualBox Ubuntu 14.04 wasn't booting properly, and I read somewhere about updating my packages.

On my Ubuntu system, my ubuntu skype, seems to prefer the on-board audio, which works out well because the usb sound device does not have a microphone jack anyway.\nJust to be complete I located such a sound adapter online which purports to support Linux.  I can't say I'm recommending this one, necessarily, as I've never tried it.  At $3 and free shipping it might not be the greatest quality, but the one I'm using barely cost more than that, it has lasted me five years, and it sounds great, so you never can tell.

There is no option on the TV (sporting a 720p resolution btw). The comp is running Intel HD Graphics 4000. \nThere is no options to compensate for this in the Ubuntu Settings and I been playing around with xrandr (using transform/scale) but nothing seems to work. The plethora of guides on this subject using transform doesn't work me. This is so annoying since it seems to be so easy to fix (\"compressing\"/resizing the image to fit the screen) but I have run out of ideas. Setting custom resolutions doesn't help (still parts out of the screen). Its basically 2 clicks away to fix in windows but in ubuntu it seems impossible...\nWould be really happy if someone could help me out or have any ideas what I could try! \nThanks.\n\nA: I ran into this issue and used a combination of shrinking the framebuffer and then realigning the top left corner. The other answers depended on specific features provided by the display which some older displays don't have. (like mine)\nxrandr --output HDMI2 --fb 1240x700 --transform 1,0,-20,0,1,-10,0,0,1\n\nSo, to read this, my TV overscans the picture by 20 pixels on the sides and 10 pixels on the top and bottom. So \"shrinking\" the picture, but not the resolution, by 40 width and 20 height, then realigning the top left corner did the trick for me.\nYou'll probably have to play around with the numbers since it seems different manufacturers' overscan varies in pixel loss. My TV seems to overscan less than many of the examples I found googling the subject.\nAlso, when playing with the numbers, doing a --transform none resets any change you make back... which might help.\n\nA: I struggled with this for a while until I found this blog post.\nBasically, check the properties on your display using:\nxrandr --prop\n\nI didn't have the underscan options some people have mentioned, but what I did have was the 'force-dvi' property under 'audio'.\nxrandr --output HDMI-2 --set audio force-dvi --mode 1920x1080\n\nThis worked perfectly, and disabled the overscan. One slight downside - this fix stops audio from coming through your HDMI cable, but I use external speakers so not really a problem.\n\nA: Okay, if you haven't already tried these, check it out\nxrandr --output HDMI-1 --set underscan on\nxrandr --output HDMI-1 --set \"underscan hborder\" 40 --set \"underscan vborder\" 25\n\nAnother one I came across was this:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --transform 1.05,0,-35,0,1.05,-19,0,0,1\n\n\nA: /etc/rc.local:\nintel_panel_fitter -p A -x 1200 -y 670\n\n~/.xprofile:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --transform 1.0,0,+1,0,1.0,+2,0,0,1\n\n\nA: The original answer xrandr --output HDMI-1 --set underscan on works! \nIt might not work on the first try if you just copy and paste this. The reason is that you might not be on HDMI-1 on your system. I tried this and I got error of failed request bad output (invalid parameter). I typed xrandr by itself and it gave me a bunch of display data and I noticed my device is HDMI-0. I then typed the command as xrandr --output HDMI-0 --set underscan on and whoop there it was fitting perfectly. I hope this helps someone. \n\nA: Are you absolutely certain there is no option on the TV?  I too have Intel HD Graphics and had the same problem, until I changed \"Theater Settings\" from \"Full\" to \"Native\".  On my TV this was at the bottom of the picture menu.  Other TVs sometimes label it as \"Widescreen Settings\" or similar.\n\nA: I know this thread is old, however if anyone else comes across this issue; the problem could be on the TV.

I had this problem on Ubuntu 14.04, which also jettisoned fglrx after an upgrade.\nMy monitor (Viewsonic) has two input settings, 'PC' and 'AV'. For some reason the input setting had been switched to 'AV', and that's where I was seeing the overscan. Switching it to 'PC' fixed the problem. \nSo the fix involves using the monitor hardware keys and going through the monitor settings menu to make the change.\n", "Q: Prevent the tag of each tab from shrinking when opening more tabs in Chrome browser When opening more and more tabs (50+) in Chrome browser, the tag of each tab becomes smaller and smaller, which makes switching between tabs difficult and the name on the tag disappears eventually.\nThis is not the case in Firefox.

How can I enable bash expansion by custom keyboard shortcuts in 14.04?

What am I doing wrong? What executes these commands if not bash? Why aren't the subshells or variables/tildes expanded?\n\nA: The keyboard shortcuts field in Unity works in a similar manner to .desktop files, i.e. commands are executed without any form of subshell or variable expansion and can't access any environment variables.\nI wasn't able to find an official specification regarding the keyboard shortcuts menu but I think it's save to assume that command execution follows similar guidelines to the Exec field in XDG .desktop files.\nWhat this means, in practice, is that there are two ways you can make your custom command-line work with the shortcuts menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transform your commands into a simple shell script and point the keyboard shortcut to the shell script. \nFor instance, you could paste the following into a new text file, name it something like custom_screenshot_script and make the script executable:\n#!/bin/bash\ngnome-screenshot --window --remove-border -f \"~/Pictures/screenshot_$(date +%x_%H:%M:%S:%N).png\"\n\n\n*Call bash to execute your command.\nThis is more tricky because you have to escape your arguments correctly. Something like the following should work:\nbash -c \"gnome-screenshot --window --remove-border -f \\\"~/Pictures/screenshot_$(date +%x_%H:%M:%S:%N).png\\\"\"\n\n\nA: In my case I would make a script:\n/bin/sh\nCase (window_border) in\n        ~./picture\n    gnome-screenshot --window ~/picture/screenshot_$(date+%X_% H:$M:$:$S:$n)*png\n\n    Bash -i remove-border -f window\n\n    Bash --window --remove-border -f ''~/picture/screenshot_$(date+%X_%H:$M:$:$S:$N).png''\n\nendl\nand it might work Fine This Way.\n", "Q: System in Low Graphics Mode how to delete /dev/sda7?

I don't have an optical drive, so I'm doing this install via USB.\nThe laptop originally came with Windows 8, but I wiped the whole thing and installed Ubuntu. In my moment of genius, I didn't create a Windows recovery disk, nor did I leave a Windows partition. Certainly not my finest hour.\nAnyways, fast-forward to today, and I need to return to Windows for work reasons. I got a Windows 7 iso, a clean USB, and set to work creating a bootable USB. I first tried Startup Disk Creator, but that crashed upon opening. \nNext I went with UNetbootin and Gparted. I followed multiple instructions online on how to setup the USB. Each instruction was the exact same. I had my bootable USB, so I shutdown and restarted my computer.\nThe first time I did this, BIOS didn't even recognize that I had a USB plugged in. I took it out and tried a few different times. No go.\nI shredded the USB using sudo shred -v /dev/sdb1, reformatted as FAT32, and then started again. Same result.\nThen I decided to skip Gparted and just try UNetbootin on its own. This time, BIOS recognized the USB, but still won't boot from it. Even when I set it as priority and disable the other HDD, nothing happens.\nI have an iMac, so I tried creating a bootable USB that way, but again, nothing happens in BIOS. The USB is recognized, but nothing happens beyond that. I've formatted it as NTFS, FAT32, etc, but nothing happens. \nI got another USB and put a fresh copy of Ubuntu 14.04 on it, figuring I'd boot from the USB, select 'Try Ubuntu', use Gparted to partition away a significant amount of Ubuntu, shut down, and then load my Windows USB.\nUnfortunately, my computer doesn't even recognize that USB. Previously, I'd had to wipe Ubuntu and fresh install it (twice, actually) on this very laptop. I had zero problems doing that. For some reason, I can't fresh install Ubuntu anymore.\nF2, F8, F10, F12, and DEL are the keys I know of for bootloading. F2, F12, and Del all bring me to BIOS, but the others do nothing. Previously, F8 worked perfectly as my \"boot from disk\" key, but it doesn't work anymore.\nI'm nearing my wits end. I've done everything I can think of to get this working. I've tried multiple Windows ISOs, multiple Ubuntu ISOs, etc. Nothing works. \nI know that the ISO isn't corrupted, because VirtualBox loads it just fine. However, my computer is too slow for that to be a permanent solution.\nI'd like to wipe the whole HDD and install Windows, but I'm afraid that if I wipe Ubuntu, I may not be able to fresh install, since it doesn't appear to be letting me now. \nAny suggestions would be great. Again, Startup Disk Creator (both versions) don't work. UNetbootin and UNetbootin 494 don't work. Gparted makes it so my computer can't even detect a USB. I'd love to get this working by this weekend if possible. \n\nThis is what I get when I use winusb: \ngrub-install: error: /media/winusb_target_1407472596_7189 doesn't look like an EFI partition. \nError occurred! \nSyncing... \n/usr/bin/winusb: line 78: 11389 Terminated              while true; do\n    sleep 0.05; echo 'pulse';\ndone\nCleaning... \n/usr/bin/winusb: line 78: 11577 Terminated              while true; do\n    sleep 0.05; echo 'pulse';\ndone\nUmounting and removing '/media/winusb_iso_1407472596_7189'... \nUmounting and removing '/media/winusb_target_1407472596_7189'...\n\n\nEdit: I tried using WinUSB again after formatting the USB as FAT32.

Extract it, rename it to bootx64.efi and place it on USB in efi/boot folder.\n\n\nThat's it. Now the USB drive is UEFI bootable (but not BIOS) and can be used to install Windows in EFI mode.

You are probably using ssh.\nInstalling an X server on the EC2 instance won't help, because you need this application's graphical interface to appear on your end, not on the screen attached to the server. (There probably is no such screen, but even if there were, it wouldn't help you.)\nAssuming the machine you're connecting from (i.e., the computer you're physically using) is running Ubuntu or some other operating system that uses the X window system for its GUI, you can use X11 forwarding (ssh -X).\nRight now, you're probably connecting to the EC2 server with a command like:\nssh username@hostname\n\n(Where hostname is either the domain name or IP address of the EC2 instance, or perhaps its \"simple name\" if you're connecting through a VPN.)\nTo forward X11, change this to:\nssh -X username@hostname\n\nIn my experience, remotely controlled GUI applications run via ssh -X often lag perceptibly. You may be able to improve performance by using the blowfish cipher:\nssh -c blowfish -X username@hostname\n\nAnd unless your connection to the EC2 instance is extremely fast, you may be able to improve responsiveness further with data compression:\nssh -C -c blowfish -X username@hostname\n\n(These can be used in any combination; for example, you could use ssh -C -X username@hostname if you wanted.)\nIf ssh -X doesn't work, it might be disabled on the server. In that case, open /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server. Search for a line that says X11Forwarding no and change it to X11Forwarding yes. (If there is no such line, simply add X11Forwarding yes.)\nFurther reading: How to forward X over SSH from Ubuntu machine?\nConnecting from Windows using PuTTY\nIf you are using PuTTY on Windows (which now appears to be the case, based on the screenshot you've uploaded), then this is still an SSH connection, but you're not using the ssh command so the above client-side syntax won't help you.\nInstead, you'll have to:\n\n*\n\n*Configure PuTTY to forward X11.\n\n*Install an run an X11 server on your Windows system.\n\n(Note that while your Windows system is the SSH client and the EC2 instance is the SSH server, it's the other way around for X11: the SSH client runs the X server and the SSH server runs the X client.)\nX11 Forwarding using Xming and PuTTY explains how to install the Xming X server on your Windows system and configure PuTTY to forward X11. In short:\n\n*\n\n*Download Xming from its project page.\n\n*Install Xming and Xming-fonts (both are included in what you downloaded).\n\n*Run Xming.\n\n*Run PuTTY, find X11 (it's in the left panel, under SSH, which itself is under Connection). Click on X11.\n\n*Make sure the \"Enable X11 forwarding\" checkbox is checked, the contents of the textbox labeled \"X display location\" are localhost:0, and the option button under \"Remote X11 authentication protocol\" is set to MIT-Magic-Cookie-1.\n\n*Then connect with PuTTY to your EC2 instance, as normal.\n\nOptionally (and not taken from that source):\n\n*\n\n*If you want to use the blowfish cipher, click SSH on the left panel, select Blowfish in the \"Encryption cipher selection policy\" listbox, and click the Up button until it's at the top of the list. That's essentially the equivalent of -c blowfish if you were using the ssh command.\n\n*If you want to use compression, then also after clicking SSH on the left panel, make sure the \"Enable compression\" checkbox, under \"Protocol options,\" is checked.\n\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*How to use X11 forwarding with putty\n\n*Nathan Osman's answer to How to run GUI applications remotely on a headless server?\n", "Q: ext4 data recovery from gparted error There is a number of other questions on this topic, however majority concerns formatted partitions or drive failure. In my case:  \nDuring resizing and moving 2.7TB partition in Gparted, I encountered an error that froze the whole program. (I dont have a screenshot or output from it, as fas as I remember, it was something about error when reading partition).\nI ran mkfs.ext4 -S and fsck.ext4 -y.\nIt took it couple of days,then the system was crashing because it ran out of RAM and SWAP (8+8GB). After adding 200GB of swap, fsck ran for about two weeks but suddenly stopped with an error, unfortunately I didnt screenshot.  \nI tried running the same combination of mkfs and fsck again, but this time every time fsck ran, it made two cores of my CPU to go 100% and utterly froze the entire system. Not even alt+sysrq REISUB worked. This happened 2-3 times.  \nThe current output from fsck is:  \n\next2fs_open2: Bad magic number in super-block\n  fsck.ext4: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...\n  fsck.ext4: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdd1\n  The superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4\n  filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4\n  filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock\n  is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:\n      e2fsck -b 8193 <device>\n   or\n      e2fsck -b 32768 <device> \n\nwhen running sudo e2fsck -b 8193 or 32768, the output is:  \n\ne2fsck: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while >trying to open /dev/sdd1\n  Could this be a zero-length partition? \n\nI tried running testdisk but it stops at 2026 cylinder and does not go any further no matter how long I wait. I do have a backup made by ddrescue, but because of that I completely ran out of free space on any of my drives.\nI fear, that error during moving/resizing partitions has made all the data on the partition chopped up and unintelligible to data recovery software.  \nI will appreciate any kind of suggestion as to what my next step should be.\nShould I give up and dd the image back to the partition and try again with fsck?\nThank You\n\nA: Do you know if the original resize/move failed when moving the partition, or when resizing the partition?\nIf it was during a move, then a good approach is to restore the dd image and try to figure out where the sectors are duplicated, and where the duplication (or copy) of sectors stops.  From there you can work backwards to piece the two halves of the partition together.\nIf the problem occurred during a resize operation, and tools like fsck cannot fix the problem, then you might consider trying to recover the data files with a disk scanning tools such as photorec.\n", "Q: Brief tty screen before boot login screen shows up After I installed an NVIDIA graphics driver, a tty login screen appears about halt a second just before the lightdm shows up.

The installation of Ubuntu was finished successfully. But when I rebooted (with secure boot disabled) it is not showing any GRUB menu and directly going to Windows.\nSo I tried Boot-Repair. For this I plugged our USB drive back in and reboot so that the live version of Ubuntu runs again. Then I used following command for boot repair.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nThen I repaired the boot with the launched Boot-Repair window.

Doing so will prevent you from accessing the files on your Windows partition from inside Ubuntu. If you don't care that's fine, if you do care then don't hibernate windows and turn off hybrid shutdown as described below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Control Panel\" > \"Power Options\" > \"Choose what the power buttons do\"\n\n*Click \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\"\n\n*Under \"Shutdown settings\" uncheck \"Turn on fast startup\", then click \"Save\"\n\n*If you don't see \"Turn on fast startup\" it is already disabled\n\n\nIf the first set of steps doesn't fix the problem, you'll have to wait for an answer from someone with more detailed knowledge of boot-repair and grub.\n", "Q: How to successfully install itunes on ubuntu 12.04?

the Ubuntu installer for Windows so that I can dual boot This question may be very naive and silly, but i was reading up on downloading Ubuntu on my Windows 7 device so that i could dual boot, and use programs on Windows 7, as well as use Ubuntu. This seemed like the best option for me. The article i was reading stated that for this option, the easiest thing to do was download a Windows Installer for Ubuntu. They provided a link, so clicked it, and it took me to the Desktop Download page, which i thought was the installer. I downloaded the .iso file, but realized that that wasn't what i was supposed to have downloaded. I tried to look for the Windows installer so that i can install is almost as a program, but i can't find anything. Am i looking for the right thing? If so, where is the Windows installer. If not, what do i download for the dual boot system, and what do i do, since everything I've read says not to download the .iso file. \nThanks!\n\nA: Download the Ubuntu iso File Extract it Find Wubi.exe in extracted folder double click it and follow on screen instructions \n\nA: You should read this page for further informations: Ubuntu Wiki Wubi Guide\n\nA: No its not a silly question. :)\nUbuntu used to have a windows installer (for XP and win7) called Wubi (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#Warning). With it you could install Ubuntu without the need to partition you hard disk (its main benefit). But it has been dropped starting version 13.04 and as far as I know is not being maintained.\nYou can still dual boot with windows.

Assume that I have a directory structure as follows:\napplication\n│\n├── config\n│   ├── c1.conf\n│   └── c2.conf\n│\n├── logs\n│   ├── l1.txt\n│   └── l2.txt\n│\n└── src\n    ├── static\n    ├── s1.py\n    └── s2.py\n\nNow I want to delete all the folders except config and logs (in this case, only src). my PWD is currently a parent of appliaction/ dir (i.e. I can see application in my PWD).\nWhat command should I use?\n(I tried with rm -rf with some options but mistakenly deleted other files, so I would like to know the correct answer before trying anything else!)\n\nA: Try find ./application/ -type d -not -name config -not -name logs. \nIf that returns the proper directories, run \nfind ./application/ -type d -not -name config -not -name logs -exec rm -R {} \\;\nThe exec rm -R {} \\; at the end removes the directory even if it is not empty.\n\nA: This way is a little more work than some other possible solutions, but when I'm deleting files I like to be able to double check what's going away forever. The steps below assume you can see \"application\" in your PWD, as stated in your question.\nFirst create a new text file containing the names of every folder you want to keep (not delete), with one folder per line. Save it as to-keep.txt for example:\nconfig\nlogs\n\nThen copy the following into a text editor and save it as rm-exclude.sh so that all three files are in the same directory.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nfind \"./$1\" -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -path \"./$1\" > to-delete.txt\n\ndels=`cat to-delete.txt`\nreadarray -t keeps < to-keep.txt\n\nfor keep in \"${keeps[@]}\"; do\n    dels=`echo \"$dels\" | grep -v \"$keep\"`\ndone\n\necho \"$dels\" > to-delete.txt\n\nMake it executable using:\nchmod +x rm-exclude.sh\nThen run it with the following, where PATH is the path to the \"application\" folder from your PWD. In your example, PATH would simply be application.\n./rm-exclude.sh PATH\nFinally, check to-delete.txt to make sure nothing is getting deleted that shouldn't be, and run:\nreadarray -t dels < to-delete.txt; for del in \"${dels[@]}\"; do rm -rf \"$del\"; done\nIf you don't care about checking the contents of the txt file, you can simply copy and paste the above command to the end of rm-exclude.sh so that running the script does everything as long as you have to-keep.txt already filled out. The end result should be that every direct subfolder of application not in to-keep.txt will be deleted, along with their contents.\n\nA: Based on Jos's answer, I use this to delete all files and directories in the current directory only, except for the .git directory.\nsudo find /home/jeffy/django_files/djauth_lifecycle_tutorial/part_04/ -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -not -name .git -exec rm -rf {} \\;\nI actually got scared and thought this deleted the .git directory as well, but I just forgot to use the a flag with la (ls -la).\nThe mindepth flag is to avoid deleting the root directory itself. The -maxdepth prevents all sub-directories and files from being returned, which are redundant with the f flag.\n(Also, never use relative paths when using rm -r!)\n\nA: What I will do with my shell (zsh) is the following (but I think that with bash ther is something equivalent). \n\n\n*\n\n*Type \necho application/*(/) \n\nand, without hitting return, press TAB. \n\n\n*the shell will expand the pattern glob; in this case, a list of all directories under application; the line should be now \necho application/config application/logs application/src\n\n\n*Now I would edit the line to remove the directories I want to maintain. \n\n*I triple check and edit the initial echo to rm -rf. \n\n*I check again and...\n\n*...hit return. \nAnyway, that kind of task (selecting by hand files or folders to apply action to them) is really better done with some kind of visual aid, unless you are a command-line \"nerd\" like myself... for example people is really fond of Midnight Commander. \n", "Q: Unable to Boot Ubuntu after Windows 8.1 Installation. I first installed Ubuntu 14.04 from live USB and after confirming that it s working properly i installed windows 8.1 from CD.\nNow i am unable to boot Ubuntu. Although Windows is working fine.\n\nA: Windows replaces the boot loader at the start of the drive with its own. All you have to do is reinstall the GRUB boot loader Ubuntu uses.\nYou can boot up on a Live DVD or USB stick and reinstall GRUB to your drive by opening a terminal and issuing the \"sudo grub-install /dev/sda\" command (assuming your boot drive appears as /dev/sda). Remember to install to the DRIVE (eg: sda), not the partition (eg: sda1).\nIn future, install Ubuntu after Windows to save headaches.\n", "Q: Installing Broadcom B43 Wireless firmware I've been at this for 3 hours and I can't figure out why it's not working! I successfully got the installer installed, but when I check for the firmware it says it's not there. My wireless device's PCI.ID is 14e4:4318 rev 02 and I cannot connect via ethernet cable. So I have to transfer the files to install.\nThere's conflicting instructions and I can't wrap my head around what's what now.

Does anyone have any experience using the above printer in Ubuntu? Going by the long list of compatible Samsung printers on Ubuntu's website, I'm sure it's a fairly safe bet, but if anyone can confirm this I'd appreciate it.\nEdit I'm not sure how to answer my own question, but having bought and installed the printer with no problems at all, I can say that yes, it is Ubuntu friendly.\n\nA: I use an old Samsung laser printer myself and it works fine. When I first got it, there was not a specific driver for it available. In cases like this you can generally use the \"next nearest\" model's driver with little or no loss in functionality.\nIf the printer understands PostScript, you can use the printer with a generic PostScript driver if you only print structured documents instead of bitmap images or the like.\nDepending on what country you are in, local consumer law may also allow you to buy the printer and then return it if it is \"not fit for purpose\", but this is of course inconvenient and not really fair on the vendor either.\nAlso have a gander at openprinting.org and see if there's any info on your model.\n", "Q: How to copy data between Virtual machines I have a linux machine, and windows is installed as a VM. While copying a data from linux desktop into windows, data is not receiving (I mean copy and paste).\nIs there any way to copy data between two virtual machines?\n\nA: The answer should be complex, I hope not too much complicate, but more you read down more it is complex:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can copy few (or more) lines with copy & paste mechanism.   \nFor this you need to share clipboard between host OS and guest OS, installing Guest Addition on both the virtual machines (probably setting bidirectional and restarting them).\nYou copy from guest OS in the clipboard that is shared with the host OS.\nThen you paste from the host OS to the second guest OS.  \n\n*You can enable drag and drop too with the same method (Click on the machine, settings, general, advanced, drag and drop: set to bidirectional ) \n\n*You can have common Shared Folders on both virtual machines and use one of the directory shared as buffer to copy.   \nInstalling Guest Additions\nyou have the possibility to set Shared Folders too. As you put a file in a shared folder from host OS or from guest OS, is immediately visible to the other. (Keep in mind that can arise some problems for date/time of the files when there are different clock settings on the different virtual machines).\nIf you use the same folder shared on more machines you can exchange files directly copying them in this folder.\n\n*You can use usual method to copy files between 2 different computer with client-server  application. (e.g. scp with sshd active for linux, winscp... you can get some info about SSH servers e.g. here)   \nYou need an active server (sshd) on the receiving machine and a client on the sending machine. Of course you need to have the authorization setted (via password or, better, via an automatic authentication method).  \nNote: many Linux/Ubuntu distribution install sshd by default: you can see if it is running with pgrep sshd from a shell. You can install with sudo apt-get install openssh-server.\n\n*You can mount part of the file system of a virtual machine via NFS or SSHFS on the other, or you can share file and directory with Samba.\nYou may find interesting the article Sharing files between guest and host without VirtualBox shared folders with detailed step by step instructions.\nYou should remember that you are dialling with a little network of machines with different operative systems, and in particular:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Each virtual machine has its own operative system running on and acts as a physical machine.  \n\n*Each virtual machine is an instance of a program owned by an user in the hosting operative system and should undergo the restrictions of the user in the hosting OS.\nE.g Let we say that Hastur and Meow are users of the hosting machine, but they did not allow each other to see their directories (no read/write/execute authorization). When each of them run a virtual machine, for the hosting OS those virtual machine are two normal programs owned by Hastur and Meow and cannot see the private directory of the other user. This is a restriction due to the hosting OS. It's easy to overcame it: it's enough to give authorization to read/write/execute to a directory or to chose a different directory in which both users can read/write/execute.   \n\n*Windows likes mouse and Linux fingers. :-)\nI mean I suggest you to enable Drag & drop to be cosy with the Windows machines and the Shared folders or to be cosy with Linux.\nWhen you will need to be fast with Linux you will feel the need of ssh-keygen and to Generate once SSH Keys to copy files on/from a remote machine without writing password anymore. In this way it functions bash auto-completion remotely too!  \n\nA: You could use scp or WinSCP for this.\nAn alternative might be to set up shared folders between the VirtualBox and the host machine.  \nI don't have VirtualBox, but to copy from my host machine to it's KVM guests I use:  \nscp <filename> guest:\n\nThe ':' at the end is required to let scp know it's copying to \"another\" machine and not to the host machine. The command for a VirtualBox VM is probably the same.\nI found a more detailed explanation here, but since I don't use VirtualBox myself I cannot verify it.\n\nA: Check the 'Advanced' tab of the 'General' settings of your VM in Virtual Box Manager. You can there activate the shared clipboard and the drag'n'drop.\nMore of it, you can set up shares between host and VM in the VM settings.\nAnd finally, you can start a virtual network linking all VMs and optionally the host. Go to the global preferences, line Network, tab 'host-only network' and click the button add. Next,in the VM settings, add a host-only network adapter and select the private network you created.\nHTH\n", "Q: laggy video and games in 14.04.1 I just installed a fresh install of 14.04.1 tonight after being away from Ubuntu for a while due to failed updates making it unusable. I have it working but then tried to watch a video on YouTube. The sound was fine, but the frame rate was terrible. Closer to seconds per frame instead of frames per second.\nFor instance, on the first mission in L4D2, it took, after loading, five minutes to get through the part of the scene before you start controlling the character. Five minutes. And it wasn't done by then. I just got sick of it and tried to change the video settings to the lowest settings. That did not help one iota. After another minute, I quit the game, which took another minute or two.\nI'm using an EVGA GeForce GTS 450 card, an AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 B55 Processor × 3 (black edition) (sold as two core and I unlocked a third core) with 20gb of ram. I shouldn't be having any trouble, especially not on a windowed mode game at the lowest settings, or on YouTube videos at the lowest resolution, either.\nHow can I fix this issue? It's almost enough to hunt down a torrent of Win7 just to get the games I want to play running. Not quite, but close.\n\nA: Unfortunately built-in driver support for nVidia graphics cards isn't very good. As you've noted, they're fine for basic computing, but anything requiring hardware acceleration or 3D support like videos or games won't run well at all.\nIn most cases you can solve the problem by searching \"Additional Drivers\" in the Dash.

This way, you can still use 192.168.1.x addresses everywhere. The router must be the default gateway of all servers.\nIf you really want to keep the things separated (router on one side and servers on the other side, your Linux machine acting as a gateway in-between), you'll have to configure two different subnet.\nLet's keep eth0 as it is now (192.168.1.0 with 255.255.255.0 subnet mask).\nBut you'll have to put the eth1 and all the servers in another subnet, like 192.168.2.0 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0.\nIf you give 192.168.2.1 as IP address on eth1, this address must be configured as the default gateway of all your internal servers.\nAlso, you'll have to enable IP forwarding on Linux, which you already done.\n", "Q: Store Ratings in Quod Libet I use Quod Libet as music library player.

I have my own header files and libraries, which I don't want to copy for every new project, since this makes fixing bugs or adding new features to the library difficult. So I want to put them in a 'public' directory like /usr/include or /usr/local/include and their library counterparts, but I don't know where I am messing with the system! I could create my own directory and specify it with every compile, but that's cumbersome. Where can I put those files? I found a question about that, where the answer is /usr/local/include, but I read somewhere that it is used for the package manager, is that true?\n\nA: If the applications are to be used by all the user in the system, the /usr/local tree is the ideal place; no package should put files there (it is for software you are compiling yourself), but the directory /usr/local/lib is in the default path for the dinamyc loader. (see /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf).\nI normally even move the /usr/local tree under /home (just by moving the directory /usr/local to /home/local, and then symlinking /usr/local -> /home/local) so that it survives a complete reinstall(1).\nIf the applications are just for your user, I normally create $HOME/lib, $HOME/include and then play with environment variables or compiler flags to point to them. \n\nFootnotes\n(1) I normally install / and /home on separate partitions, but this is a very personal choice. \n\nA: I have created the convention of creating a new local directory in /usr/local. so it's /usr/local/local/lib for me.  This allows other developers to release their stuff into /usr/local and you then don't get any file name clashes.  If you then want to publish and move your stuff to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include you may need to make a name change across all your source and make files, which will be a pain, but sed will help if you take care and proceed with caution.  When you have libraries in /usr/local/lib or any where that is non-standard you have to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so executing programs know where to look to link themselves.\n", "Q: upgrading missing packages?

What is the difference between the role that Media Tomb and Samba play in letting me access the files on my NAS? Do I need them both?\n\nA: Yes, you need both. You need Samba to join the Workgroup that your NAS is a member of. The default name is \"WORKGROUP\" but that may vary. In your Files manager, a \"Network\" item will appear. If you click that, you will be able to access the files on the NAS.\nMedia Tomb - or any media player - will probably not allow you to play songs on the network straightaway. To do this, you need to create a directory (something like /media/nas) where you will put the share. Think of /media/nas as a drive letter under Windows. This is a process called mounting. As soon as the NAS is mounted under /media/nas, you can access the music as if it was stored locally, and Media Tomb will find it.\nIf the mount succeeds, you should consider adding a line in /etc/fstab to have your NAS automatically mounted the next time you reboot.\nPlenty of information on how to install Samba and connect to a workgroup, as well as mounting a share and making sure it is remounted at boot time, is available on this web site.\n", "Q: Installing icewm from source does not work but apt-get works I tried to install from source a modified version of icewm, but I got an error so I decided to first install original version to provide dependencies. \nI installed icewm using apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install icewm\n\nI want to install icewm from source and I used apt-get to get all dependencies.

I'm using an older Dell D620 withe nearly 4 MB Ram and dual 1.6 Mhz processors.\nIt seems a though it works fine at first installation, but then when I use terminal to add certain programs, etc., it bogs down and I've never figured out how to \"un-do\" what I've done.  A major culprit for me has been Netflix Desktop.\nAnyway, several days ago, I tried a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04.  I looked at so many options to install the gnome classic desktop with the \"no efects\" option and luckily stumbled on one that worked without slowing things down at all.  Everything was speeding along nicely - I couldn't believe it. So I used Backup to backup to a Windows share on a Networked WinXP laptop.  That seemed to go well with no problems.  BUT, then I did the deed...I installed Netflix Desktop and the whole thing started dragging along.\nI ended up re-installing 14.04 and couldn't figure out which Gnome install I had used earlier.  I was trying to just re-trace my steps and this time, NOT install Netflix Desktop.  But I couldn't find the exact method, terminal commands I used to install the Gnome Desktop.  It may have even ben the Gnome Desktop Environment from Software Center...like I said, I've tried so many  ways that I got a bit confused.\nOne hint, for anyone who may be able to help, is that when I started up my laptop, there was something new with the good installation, a brief boot screen that said \"Debian\" across the bottom.  I have not been able to reproduce this since.  It was working perfectly, too.  :(\nSo I tried another clean install of 14.04 but could not reproduce how I got the right Gnome desktop that had the Debian boot screen, as in my nice, speedy installation.\nFrustrating.

I've seen numerous suggestions to access the Windows share with no luck at all.\nIf anyone can help me Restore that good, fast, perfect installation from my windows share, or alternately, to somehow reproduce how I finally, after all these months, did a clean install with that Debian boot screen and the option to boot using the Gnome Classsic with no effects, I sure would be grateful.\n\nA: After you installed 14.04, did you bring it fully up to date to 14.04.1?

For instance, when going thru the action that sends mail, it may wait too long and generate timeout because the mail server is not up, leading to you thinking that your code is not functioning.\nMy personal approach on the subject is not to stop the mail server, but it is to act at code level and at system level :\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, if you need to send mail, you don't need to have a full mail server like Sendmail or Postfix or Qmail installed. You can just install the ssmtp package which is enough to send mail using a mail relay configured into /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf. \n\n*If your application is sending mail by using a local binary like mail or sendmail, stopping the mail server may not be the solution : mails can be queued locally and if you start again the mail server, all the mails accumulated will be sent at once.\n\n*My ideal solution would be to send mail using the SMTP protocol directly from your application, by connecting to an IP address and a port (default 25), possibly using username and password to provide authentication.\n\n*If your application is able to send mail to a relay (being local or external), make sure that it is not hardcoded in your code but defined via a configuration file dedicated to your application. The same should apply for the destination e-mail addresses.\n\n*If you respect the previous point, then you can build a staging server which a different e-mail configuration. The configuration of the staging server can be to send mail to your personal e-mail address.\n\n*This approach as the advantages to allow you to test the e-mail functionalities too without disturbing the real destination of the production mails. Also you are sure you will don't create side effect of disabling a mail server.\n\n", "Q: Looping in bash from Makefile i need to write a Makefile that compiles each .cpp in current directory in .so file (with flags -shared -fPIC) and copyies .so file into \"../../dir/\" directory without \".so\" extension.\nFor example, if filename is \"div.cpp\" i need to compile it into \"div\" and copy to ../../dir/. \n\nA: find is a fairly useful way of batch-commanding multiple files but it only carries the full filename around which means, when used in the -o argument it would generate file.cpp.so.

I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04, and have not touched anything.\nCups is running, as reported by both ps and netstat.\nThere are /etc/init/cups.conf and /etc/init.d/cups, both of them seem to be able to start cups.\nI used these ways to determine which init daemon started cups:\n\n\n*\n\n*service cups status - \"unknown job: cups\"\n\n*initctl status cups - \"unknown job: cups\"\n\n*/etc/init.d/cups status - \"cupsd is running\"\n\n*Runlevel is 2, and there is no cups in /etc/rc2.d\nSo the question is: which init daemon started cups? The traditional Debian init, or upstart?\nIf upstart was the one started cups, why initctl status cups cannot report cups status?\n\nA: CUPS on Ubuntu is started by Upstart via the file /etc/init/cups.conf. The file /etc/init.d/cups is ignored. /etc/init/cups.conf is not an init script, but a configuration for Upstart. It does start the main daemon, and is not only a pre- and post- configuration for CUPS.\nThe service and initctl utilities report unknown job when the variable UPSTART_SESSION is set in the environment because in that case, the two utilities are acting on the session init and not the system init (cups is started by the system init). su usually preserves the environment, while sudo does not, so sudo initctl status cups will work but su -c \"initctl status cups\" will not.\n\nA: Of the two, only one is actually an init script: /etc/init.d/cups. The /etc/init/cups.conf file appears to be a configuration file and runs certain things before/after the daemon is started but it is not itself an init script. It lacks the proper format (start,stop,restart etc. functions) and in any case, is not in the right place. Init scripts are in the init.d directory.\nAs for who started it, 14.04 is still using upstart, they will be moving to systemd for future releases. So it was upstart that started the cups daemon.\nNow, as to why neither service nor initctl returned anything useful, that's because you did not use sudo:\nterdon@16:~$ service cups status\nstatus: Unknown job: cups\nterdon@16:~$ sudo service cups status\n[sudo] password for terdon: \ncups start/running, process 1319\n\nterdon@16:~$  initctl status cups \ninitctl: Unknown job: cups\nterdon@16:~$ sudo initctl status cups \ncups start/running, process 1319\n\n", "Q: Tor not working?

Since I don't want to change the default shell to bash for the whole system and I can't change the tool itself, I'm trying to write a script that will alias sh to /bin/bash. Alias itself doesn't work because the call to sh is done by full path: /bin/sh rather than just sh.\nIs there a way to fool an executable that /bin/sh is actually another file, without having root privileges and without affecting other programs?\nThanks\n\nA: If the offending tool is lame enough to call /bin/sh directly, instead of respecting your system setup by using /usr/bin/env sh, your options are very limited. I originally thought you'd be able to basically do what virtual environments do for Python, but after attempting to write a script that did so I couldn't get around the direct call to /bin/sh via any $PATH magic.\n\n\n*\n\n*Before calling the tool, re-symlink sh to bash, then undo your change after the call to the tool.\n\n*Better yet, change your assumption that you can't edit the tool. What's the tool? If it's open source, which it seems like it is given you have some knowledge of how it works, fork it, change it to use /usr/bin/env sh and submit a pull request. Huzzah for open source contributions!\n\n\nIf the offending tool isn't actually calling /bin/sh directly, as your recent comment may indicate, the following should work.\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\nBASH_VENV_HOME=$HOME/.bash_venv\n\nif [ ! -d $BASH_VENV_HOME ]; then\n    mkdir $BASH_VENV_HOME\nfi\n\n# Make an `sh` binary in the front of your path that points to bash\nif [ ! -e $BASH_VENV_HOME/sh ]; then\n    ln -s /bin/bash $BASH_VENV_HOME/sh\nfi\norig_path=$PATH\nPATH=$BASH_VENV_HOME:$PATH\n\n# Call your tool\n\n# Reset path\nPATH=orig_path\n\nThe tool, should it execute sh, will then find the one in the front of your path, which is a symlink to bash.\n", "Q: How to Share folders in 14.04 Server with Gnome I'm working with a new installation of Ubuntu Server 14.04 64 bit.  During installation I picked the Samba Server option and I believe that it is running.  My intention is that an OS X machine will be able to share the top folder in a secondary internal disk (and perhaps a few other folders).  I can ping the server from my mac.  I have a minimal Gnome GUI installed and am adding functionality as needed. \nOn my 12.04 machine I just right click on a folder and share it.

Please make sure you also have installed the libpam-smbpass package. It is used to sync system users with the samba database for cases like letting users connect to a resource while asking for a password.\napt-get install libpam-smbpass\n\nIf you already have Samba installed with all needed packages then first edit the smb.conf file:\nnano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nAt the end of the file add the shared resource. In my case I will share a resource called \"shareme\":\n[shareme]  \n    comment = Server Share Resource  \n    path = /path/to/shared/resource  \n    browsable = yes  \n    guest ok = yes  \n    read only = no  \n    create mask = 0777  \n\nSave that by pressing CTRL+X which should show an option below about \"Do you want to save?\" and then exit the editor. Now restart the Samba service:\nservice smbd restart\n\nor\n/etc/init.d/smbd restart\n\nThe options above are:\ncomment - Shows the comments when browsing through a gui.  \npath - Folder you wish to share   \nbrowsable - Allows clients to see the shared resource when they use a file explorer (Like explorer on Windows or Nautilus on Ubuntu)\n.\nguest ok - Allow user to connect to the resource without the need for a password.\nread only - Sets a read-only permission so users don't start going medieval on the shared resource.\ncreate mask - When files/folders are created, this will be the permissions they will have set upon creation.. I left it like 777 which would be full to allow anyone to Read, Write or Execute, but if you don't want somebody deleting something, set them to 0755.\nThis is a general explanation, which does not include a lot of security and user options. If you want, you can also read the Samba Guide or even jump to the Ubuntu Samba Guide\nOther tips are (Which can be edited in the smb.conf file)\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are on the same workgroup (First option the samba config file)\n\n*If you start getting weird names on the shared resource, you can try adding the option mangled names=no to the Global section in the smb.conf file.\n\n*If users can see the shared resource but can not connect to it, even with the settings above, you can add/edit the option force user = YOUR_USER in the Global section which forces any resource to think the user connecting is you (Do not do this on a place you don't trust).\n\n*To see all resources on the LAN network, you can use smbtree which would look like this:\nXTREME\n    \\\\CYREX                 cyrex server (Samba, Ubuntu)\n        \\\\CYREX\\img             \n        \\\\CYREX\\movies          \n        \\\\CYREX\\TVSeries        \n        \\\\CYREX\\print$          Printer Drivers\n        \\\\CYREX\\IPC$            IPC Service (cyrex server (Samba, Ubuntu))\n\n    \\\\MARY                  mary server (Samba, Ubuntu)\n        \\\\MARY\\temas            \n        \\\\MARY\\IPC$             IPC Service (mary server (Samba, Ubuntu))\n        \\\\MARY\\print$           Printer Drivers\n\nLastly, in your question you mention you have a minimal GUI setup with Gnome. If the option to do all the sharing can be done via GUI, then you first need to install the following packages in order to have the option available when right clicking a folder (This may depend if you are using Unity/Files as the GUI or full Gnome/Nautilus as the GUI)\napt-get install samba libpam-smbpass samba-dsdb-modules samba-vfs-modules python-samba samba-common-bin samba-common samba-libs nautilus-share libgnomevfs2-extra\n\nAfter restarting, this should be enough to share via GUI and also be able to see shares. Again, in my case, I am testing this with Unity.\n", "Q: Enable Firewall in Ubuntu Hi I am running apache server in my desktop which does contain security issues so I want to  enable How to enable firewall in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Run the following commands\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ufw\nsudo ufw enable\n\nufw is probably already installed but it doesn't hurt to try and install it if it is.

For more info on using ufw I recommend this post http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1893751 You should get a pretty good idea on how to set rules from the information covered on the topic.\nA much easier way to govern your firewall rules is to install gufw which is a frontend GUI to ufw.\nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nYou can search for \"gufw\" or \"firewall\" in your apps directory or in Gnome Shell I believe it's listed under settings.\n\npicture taken from http://www.noobslab.com/2013/10/tweaksthings-to-do-after-install-of.html\n", "Q: Please help me disable authentication! This is very annoying. I don't want to sound like a drag or anything to you security people but I switched over from windows and everytime I install or do something I need to type a password. Is there anyway to disable this?\n(And please don't try to talk me out of it. Its legitly annoying.)\nEdit: I'm going back to windows. This is just too annoying. First removing of Gnome and then forcing this garbage. What is this? NSABuntu?\n\nA: Umm what do you mean \"everytime\"? I'm sitting here and I don't have to...\nTo install a program, what the computer does is (essentially 1) runs apt-get on a file you downloaded. As you may know, apt-get actually has to be sudo apt-get2.\nSo any GUI program (like the software centre) that is installing things (using an equivalent of apt-get) has to become root (done in terminal with sudo). Somehow, the Software centre has to have root privileges, and it does that by asking you your password. If you install everything in one go, it will only ask once (in fact, every 15 mins I believe).\nIf you are desperate to stop it, you can run the command sudo software-centre in terminal and anything you install won't require your password. Make sure you close it when it's done.\nYou've come over from windows, and on windows you can lower the amount of times you have to type (in UAC setting). This is not possible in Ubuntu because to do what you are evidently wanting to do you have to be sudo. To be sudo, it needs your password.\nWhenever you have to change a folder that your don't have write access to (i.e. anything other than /tmp and /home/USER) you have to become root, so that it can be modified.\nThat is why installing needs root (it changes /usr/binand other non-write folders). Adding a new user needs to change/home` and you don't have write access to that, only read.\nThis \"Annoyance\" is one of the reasons why you are highly unlikely to get a virus, or similar! Programs can't just run and destroy stuff.\nIf you can't cope, go back to windows. Have fun with the antivirus software, and restarts after every updates, and the expensive support, and the awful ui, and the price of the OS. 3\n 1 I do know that it isn't apt-get, and is just an equivalent, but this is a good way to explain why it needs a password, when windows doesn't\n2 Or root by any other means\n3 No offence to anyone who prefers all that.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server Blinking Cursor after Fresh Install Ubuntu Newbie here,\nI am installing Ubuntu Server 14 on an SSD on a Lenovo ThinkCentre, and every time I install completely, I receive the dreaded blinking cursor.

Even worse, unplugging it and plugging it back in would not remount it.  And it would not be visible in Nautilus either.\nIn my case, I would open up a terminal and issue a simple bash command in the directory, to kind of keep it \"alive\" and busy.\n$ while [ 1 == 1 ]; do sleep 1; ls; done\n\nJust make sure to do that command from inside of a directory on the external drive.  Also you can configure the sleep time to a longer value.  I just put '1' above so you could see it was working.\n", "Q: Running windows apps on Ubuntu (wine?) Hello brothers & sisters in Linux!\nI have a question concerning running windows applications on Ubuntu.\nI was using Ubuntu for a long time, but then I had to convert back to Windows because I found out that Wine didn't make it to run some applications as Photoshop, After Effects, Vegas Pro, Dreamweaver, etc... \nI'm asking you guys for a help how to run these programs in these days (sort of speak). \nHas there been any major update for Wine that eliminated those emulation problems? Will Wine run all of my applications today? If not, how can I run these applications on Ubuntu?\nThank you in advance! Really appreciate your help!\nA.\n\nA: Wine has been updated but also you can use it with PlayOnLinux which abstracts better IMHO and has pre-configurations.\n", "Q: Running {command vs through bash script} + redirect output I am not sure if it is one or two issues here:\nfile /usr/bin/line1\nwine /home/aiao/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/LINE/Line.exe > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nfile /usr/bin/line2\n!#/usr/bin/bash\nwine /home/aiao/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/LINE/Line.exe > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nThe wine command itself works fine but when I run /usr/bin/line1, I get:\n: ambiguous redirect1: 1\n\nAnd when I run /usr/bin/line2, I get:\nwine: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nHow can I run command through bash script? What is going on here?\n\nA: For starters you need a valid shebang. Your second file almost has one but the !# are the wrong way around. Second up you need a valid interpreter! None of my systems have a /usr/bin/bash, it's just /bin/bash. You could even just use /bin/sh. It's ever-so-slightly lighter.\nThe following should work:\n#!/bin/sh\nwine /home/aiao/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/LINE/Line.exe > /dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nA: In the first file you can redirect the output just using > /dev/null or &> /dev/null that will redirect stdout and stderr so no need for 2>&1.\nIn the second file, I believe the correct interpreter is #!/bin/bash.\n\nA: First of all:\nYou're using Wine which in this case may need to recreate something that mimics the runtime environment of a Windows command shell (cmd.exe).\nAs you have not told what drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/LINE/Line.exe is, there is no way to tell its requirements.\nNow : ambiguous redirect1: 1 looks as a possible output from either Wine or cmd.exe.\nMay be you need to ensure that ONLY WINE is affected by the Linux style redirects. You may need to look into what Wine expects, and how to protect/separate its parameters from those caught by bash and vise versa.\nThings to try:\nAs it works from the bash command prompt try source line2 for starters.\nIf that works, maybe a try a variant like this - from a script:\n\nbash <<EOF\nwine /home/aiao/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ (x86)/LINE/Line.exe > /dev/null 2>&1\nEOF\n\nYet another...\nstart is a Windows command line tool that applies the same tasks as a double-click on e.g. a link or file, so try:\n\nwine start /home/aiao/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/LINE/Line.exe \n\nNote: WITHOUT the redirection, if that works to actually have the program run, then - if you still need it, you might try adding >/dev/null 2>&1 (or whatever from the other answers) for Wine.\n\nA: the file handles 1 and 2 (stdout & stderr) may be closed by wine, because it doesn't use them and may even free up 0 (stdin) once it has established a keyboard handler. Also this would be more fair to windows as all file handles are available as it kind of expects in a new program-instance.\n", "Q: Scrollwheel in GNU screen in xfce4-terminal I apologize that this is pretty much a duplicate of Using the scrollwheel in GNU screen -- Trusty specific difference but I don't have enough reputation to comment on that and I can provide much more information about the issue that might help with answering both of us.\nI am currently running Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty as a clean install and having an issue with the scrollwheel functionality when running GNU screen in an xfce4-terminal.  This issue did not occur in Xubuntu 12.04.  In fact, since I spend a lot of time in a terminal window using screen this functionality was appreciated.\nHere's how to replicate it:\nOpen xfce4-terminal.\nStart screen.\nRun ls /usr/bin (or anything to get more than the terminal height in lines).\nAttempt to scroll up with the scrollwheel with the cursor in the output window.\nWhat happens:  Previous entries from .bash_history show on the command line\nExpected behavior:  Scroll back through the output\nAlso note, that at least in my case, the scrollbar seems to 'jump up' about 20 lines even though the output is not scrolled.  If I click on the scrollbar the output 'jumps up' to that position.  Dragging the scrollbar down puts the output where it belongs.  Also note that if I hover over the scrollbar and use the scrollwheel it functions as intended.\nI have Google'd all manner of permutations of my issue and have made a modifications to my .screenrc which, ironically, fixed the problem when connecting to the machine via PuTTY:\nterm xterm-256color\ntermcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@  <= this is what fixed it in PuTTY\ncaption always\ndefscrollback 4000\nstartup_message off\nmsgminwait 0\nbind \" \" windowlist -b\n\nNo matter what other termcapinfo lines I use, nothing fixes it.\nAs I said, connecting via PuTTY and running screen there it works as expected.

My idea was to build a harddisk as secondary drive into my pc (which already runs with ubuntu) and install ubuntu (or xubuntu or some other derivate with modest requirements) on it. After that I would integrate that harddisk in the old laptop.\nMy question is, how to install ubuntu on that drive without corrupting the existing boot loader, grub, whatever on the pc. Should that be installed using a live system or can it be done from the running system? Are there any pitfalls I have to deal with when I install ubuntu via another system than that it should work with afterwards?\n\nA: This maybe should be a comment rather than an answer, but I don't have enough rep to comment.\nHave you considered a netboot install?\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot\nRead the docs naturally, but I'm pretty sure this wouldn't overwrite GRUB during the install.\n\nA: You could easily do that by removing the existing hard drive from the working computer. Hook the spare drive up to the good computer as the only drive during the installation. That way you wouldn't have to worry about overwriting the existing bootloader as it wouldn't even be attached to the computer during installation. When the installation is done, swap the drives and you should be good to go.

When you've got everything, just add this to the end:\n-exec mv -t /path/to/destination {} +\n\nAnd that'll move them all into the specified directory.\n\nA Bashier way of doing this would be using a few globbing modifiers (globstar to recursive search with **, nullglob to only return valid files and nocaseglob to ignore case) and then just passing them off to mv in a simple for loop:\nshopt -s globstar nullglob nocaseglob\nfor f in /path/to/look/{**/,}*.{mp3,avi,mp4}; do\n  mv \"$f\" /path/to/destination/\ndone\n\n\nA: I would try something like..\nfor files in $(find / | grep -P \"([.]mp3$)|([.]avi$)\")\ndo\ncp $files /media/<your_external_drive>/target_folder/\ndone\n\nYou have to add every extension you want to search for in the regex if you want to do it all in one shot.\nOr if you simply want to move the directories, you could use,\ncp -r /target/dir/on/machine /target/dir/on/external/drive\n\nfor each directory containing your media files.\n\nA: I highly recommend the program FreeFileSync. It is great for not only syncing two directories, but also for the task you have in mind. You can add filters to include or exclude patterns. First you just browse to the origin on the left and the destination on the right. Then click compare to search through all your files. Finally click on the red funnel at the top to edit the filters.\nFor the filters, you place each pattern on a new line. You can replace the * in the includes section with something like the following and leave the excludes section untouched. The following will move only mp3, avi, and jpg files:\n*.mp3\n*.avi\n*.jpg\n\nOr, if you leave the * in the includes section, you can say what files you don't want to move. The following added to the excludes section will move everything except txt, odt, and pdf files:\n*.txt\n*.odt\n*.pdf\n\nOnce you make your changes and close the filter dialog, files that aren't going to be moved will be grayed out. The buttons at the bottom next to \"Select View:\" allow you to change what files are displayed (these buttons don't affect what files are going to be moved). Displaying only the \"Do nothing\" files by having only the gray bar selected, look for any you want to be moved that aren't going to be, and modify filters accordingly. Likewise, displaying only the files to be moved by having only the green arrow selected, look for any that would be moved but you don't want to be and modify filters accordingly.\n\nA: You could use a simple python script to do the job:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\nsource_dir = \"/path/to/files\"; target_folder = \"/path/to/destination\"; extensions = (\".mp3\", \".avi\")\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_dir):\n    for name in files:\n        if name.endswith(extensions):\n            file = root+\"/\"+name\n            shutil.move(file, target_folder+\"/\"+name)\n\nPaste the code above in an empty textfile, enter the target- and source directories, enter the file extensions you want to move, save it as move.py and run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/move.py\n\nTo avoid overwriting possible duplicates (and rename them)\nIf there is a risk that the directory contains duplicates (names) that you want to keep, the code is a bit more extensive: \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\nsource_dir = \"/path/to/files\"; target_folder = \"/path/to/destination\"; extensions = (\".mp3\", \".avi\")\n\ndup = 1\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_dir):\n    for name in files:\n        if name.endswith(extensions):\n            file = root+\"/\"+name\n            while os.path.exists(target_folder+\"/\"+name):\n                name = name[:name.rfind(\".\")]+\"_\"+str(dup)+name[name.rfind(\".\"):]\n                dup = dup+1\n            shutil.move(file, target_folder+\"/\"+name)\n\nIn this case, multiple occasions of file.mp3 will be renamed to:\nfile.mp3\nfile_1.mp3\nfile_2.mp3\n...etc.\n\n", "Q: Remove icons from system tray how can i disable icons within the tray?\n\nFor example, i need to turn off dropbox icon.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: /dev/sda1 is your actual hard drive and that's why it seems to have all of the space. The space you need should be dynamically allocated to /usr and available to hadoop when you install it.\n\nA: If you use lsblk as shown here:\n\n$ lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 232,9G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   487M  0 part /boot/efi\n├─sda2   8:2    0 200,5G  0 part /\n└─sda3   8:3    0    32G  0 part [SWAP]\nsdb      8:176  1   7,5G  0 disk \n└─sdb1   8:177  1   7,5G  0 part /media/hannu/PHONE_CARD\nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  \n\nyou see the contents from partition tables on sda and sdb\nsda is the first harddisk.\nsda1 - the first partition on sda as it has /boot/efi last on the same line, I can tell that this is where my boot data resides.

Since you are a newbie, I think it is unlikely that you assigned a separate partition for /usr, so /usr is using the same space as everything else (the space in /dev/sda1). So you don't need to reassign any space.\n", "Q: Are any files copied when I move files from a folder into another folder on the same disk? Or is only the reference changed? It's a general question. Not really Ubuntu-specific.\nBTW: I've tried sudo fdisk -l, it doesn't seem to give the full picture.\n\n\nA: A file in *nix consists of three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The data on the disk\n\n*An inode that points to the data on a disk and stores useful things like access and modified times, permissions, etc, etc. These will vary based on the filesystem.\n\n*One (or many) hardlinks that provide the location (path and filename) and point to the inode.\n\n\nIn effect the system is editing the hardlink but that might cause concurrency conflicts so what actually happens is the system creates a new hardlink and then deletes the old one.\nI'm the last but from here but I'll try and find a technical source for this.\n\nA: I've actually been reading up on this recently, and although it was specifically about ext2, I believe ext3 and ext4 are similar if not the same.\nLet's call your physical hard disk sda. At the highest level, your disk is first broken up into separate partitions. Each partition gets its own filesystem that decides how to manage files on that partition. For example, you might have Windows on sda1 using the NTFS filesystem, Ubuntu on sda2 using the ext4 filesystem, and Swap on sda3 that doesn't use a filesystem. Near the beginning of sda, before the partitions start, are two things. First, the boot sector, which your BIOS loads at startup and probably contains grub. Second, the partition table, which lists the details about where all the partitions begin and end on the disk. You can find out details about you partitions using sudo fdisk -l.\nInside the ext4 partition on sda2, the partition is further divided into block groups. Inside a block group is first the superblock, which gives important information about the filesystem and free space. After a few more areas used by the filesystem, are the inodes. Every inode includes a list of the locations of up to 12 data blocks. Each inode can also have a reference to up to three other inodes. The final area in the block group is for actual data, and is divided into blocks (typically 4KB each).\nEvery directory, file, and link has a unique inode. The data in files is contained in many different disk blocks that could be anywhere on the disk. The file's inode lists where to find all of the potentially scattered data blocks. Likewise, the contents of every directory are stored as data in the same way.\nWhen you open a file, for example /home/user/contacts.txt first the computer finds the inode for the root directory, which it always knows where to find. The inode lists the locations of all the data blocks that describe the contents of the directory. Then the computer searches the data blocks for an entry called \"home\". The entry for the home directory tells it where to find the inode for home on the disk. It then looks in that inode, searches the specified blocks for user, and repeats the process to find the file contacts.txt, whose inode lists the blocks that contain the file's contents.\nIf you want to move contacts.txt to /home, first you have to do everything described above to find the file's inode. Then the computer has to navigate to the inode for /home (which will be fast because Linux maintains a cache of the inodes of recently accessed directories called the dentry cache), and adds contacts.txt to the directory's data blocks. Then it has to navigate to the inode of user and search its data blocks for contacts.txt and delete its entry.\nTherefore, if both locations are on the same partition, the file's data blocks are never actually moved. The inode reference for the file will simply be moved from the origin directory's data blocks to the destination directory's data blocks. If one location is on a different partition, which counts as an entirely separate file system, the file's inode entry will be deleted, its data blocks copied, and a new inode entry created in the relevant directory's data blocks.\nThere's also one more thing that goes on in the background on ext3 and ext4. It's called journaling, and it helps ensure filesystem integrity despite crashes. Any time a file operation occurs, the filesystem write an entry in the journal describing what it's going to do. The entry is only deleted once every operation it describes has been completed. In this way, when a computer starts up after a crash in the middle of file operations, it immediately sees outstanding entries in the journal and can attempt to fix the problems.\nSource: Modern Operating Systems 3e by Andrew S.

If I put a file there on one computer, I want to be able to delete or edit it from another. I also want to run a deluge Daemon that will put files into the directories shared by samba, and minidlna streaming to xbox. \nI've tried this a couple times, and ran into many problems. My problems are with owners and permissions. First, I minidlna couldn't access things placed by Deluge because it was denied permission, So I messed around with chmod and chown, and then I couldn't delete things I'd placed in samba shares. Soon everything I tried to do ended in \"Permission Denied\". I'm going to start all over.\nI understand how to install deluge and samba, and how to edit conf files. My questions are, should I use one user for samba sharing, running deluge daemon, and minidlna? Should this user or users have a password? What should the directory and file permissions be in smb.conf? What options should I have in fstab  when I mount the partitions I'm sharing? If there's multiple users for these services, should they all be in a group?\nThe guides I have read for deluge on an ubuntu server had me create a user \"deluge\" with no password that would run the daemon. The guides on samba had me use the user I created on installation. There was no info on using them together.\n\nA: You can have the Deluge, samba and any other users involved part of a common group (say smbshare):\nsudo addgroup smbshare\nsudo adduser deluge smbshare\nsudo adduser smb smbshare\n\nThen change the group of the shared folder to smbshare:\nsudo chgrp smbshare /path/to/shared/folder\n\nThen assign group write privileges and make the folder setgid, so that anything created in it retain group ownership.\nsudo chmod g+sw /path/to/shared/folder\n\nHave a look at this question to see an example of a multi-user read/write setup: How to force group ownership on samba share?\nIn particular note the mask values set:\ncreate mask     = 0775\ndirectory mask  = 0775\n\nThey allow group write for newly created files.\n", "Q: sudo -s works but su does not in ubuntu?

This attempt has also failed, getting stuck at \"update-grub\", I thought that since i was not wiping clean the /boot partitions and just using quick format (only removing the address table) the installer would get confused as it would identify two /boot partitions, again with no luck.\nAfter my third attempt and getting tired of grub i was able to install LILO on only 1 partition without using Raid ) on it, but it takes too long to boot. I would prefer to use Grub on a RAID 0. I am not sure what to do at this time, I would appreciate any suggestions.\nThank you in advance for your time!!!\n\nA: I have been going at it all wrong. The simplest way is to burn your Alternate install on the usb, run it, and when you have to partition the disk, just create one partitions for \"/\" and one partitions for swap. Repeat this for both disks, and you are done. Make sure to turn the Boot flag \"on\". The installer takes care of the rest\n\nA: From what I recall the only alternate now that carries the software raid 0 option is Lubuntu. Then when you get to partitioning you have to create a partition on each drive and under the use as setting select use as raid instead of ext3. once that part is done you can finish setting up the raid by selecting the partitions and then setting the file system type. http://www.ubuntulinuxguide.com/software-raid-ubuntu-14-04-setup-install-configure/ (ignore the fact it is for server, process still works the same but am pretty sure you need the lubuntu alternate to get the raid options in partitioning and then just install and boot into your preferred DE)\n", "Q: Packard Bell VAB70 keyboard & touchpad not working I am trying to install Ubuntu on a Packard Bell VAB70 laptop.

There is a \"recovery button\" on my laptop (a little tiny reset button that you have to use a pen to activate.) You can re-install Windows 8 from this. However, I don't know where the install files for the button are located. If I wiped the C:/ drive and installed Ubuntu would the recovery button still work?

I recommend first shrinking your windows partition, generally labeled \"OS C:\" in Disk Management. Then start installing from your Live Media and follow this guide. Just skip \"4. Free some space for Ubuntu\" since you'll have already done that. \nWhile in Disk Management you should be able to see a partition called \"Recovery\", \"Restore\", or \"Lenovo\". This is where Windows would be restored from.\nThe guide I linked to above is nice because it has screenshots. But here's a brief summary of what manually partitioning requires. Any specific questions please feel free to comment.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the Window partition using Disk Management inside Windows by however much space you want to give to Ubuntu and swap (absolute bare minimum I'd say is 15GB).\n\n*Boot your Live Media.\n\n*At step 4 about operating systems, click \"Something Else\".\n\n*Create a new swap partition in the free space. Making it the same size as your RAM is a good rule of thumb. But leave at least 10GB free for the next step.\n\n*Create a new ext4 partition in the rest of the free space and mount it at /.\n\n*Once the installation completes, if you can't boot into both follow this guide.\n\n\nA: When you boot from LiveCD, before doing the installation, run utility called GParted. It will show you the real configuration of your disk. Prbably you will see that Windows resides on two patition, not one (a 200Mb one and a big one) and that there is a recovery partition after them and before data partition. \n", "Q: Wrong icon for a .odg files (Libreoffice Draw), Ubuntu 14.04, Libreoffice 4.2.4.2 Have strange issue.\nThe .odg files made with Libreoffice Draw have wrong icon (as shown below). \n\nOther open document formats from Libreoffice have icons similar to application icons.\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 installed with native Unity, Ambiance and ubuntu-mono-dark theme.

That is, the group comprising of the foreground job (your script), and any child processes it has in the foreground (the tail command). This causes all these processes to exit (or do whatever it is they do by handling the signal). You can test the difference by sending a signal using the kill command:\nIn one terminal, execute this script (I'm calling it test in the following commands):\n#! /bin/bash\n\nwhile true\ndo\n    if [[ $1 = a ]]\n    then\n        yes \n    else\n        echo no\n        sleep 2\n    fi\ndone\n\nIn another, execute these commands:\npstree -ps $(pgrep -f test)\npkill -f test\npstree -ps $(pgrep -f yes)\n\nThe output of the commands would be something like this:\ninit(1)───lightdm(1032)───lightdm(1154)───init(1173)───x-terminal-emul(17009)───bash(24262)───test.sh(24996)───yes(24997)\n# No output for pkill\ninit(1)───lightdm(1032)───lightdm(1154)───init(1173)───yes(24997)\n\n(The actual numbers and programs may vary, but the first init will always have pid 1.)\nAs you can see, the yes command wasn't killed, and got attached to init because its parent was killed. It's still merrily printing ys on the first terminal. So kill it with pkill -f yes. Now repeat the experiment, with one change. Instead of pkill -f test, do:\nkill -INT -25165 \n# Use the pid of test.sh given in parentheses in the output of pstree \n# instead of 25165\n\nNote the leading -. In Linux, for the kill command, -25165 is the process group, whose leader has pid 25165. Thus, this command is the equivalent of sending an interrupt from the terminal.\nOf course, the exact behaviour depends on the configuration of the TTY, the login shell and so on.

Better solve the problem with Firefox, because it is not normal.\nYour documents are residing on your Windows partition, unless you removed it during installation. In latter case your documents are in backup. Just copy them manually. You can access Windows partitions from Files, there is a list of devices on the left.   \n\nYou do not need to \"uninstall Ubuntu\" unless you've done strange things to your disk like LVM encryption. Just repair Windows bootloader and you will have it back again.

I have tweaked Unity about as much as I can since installing it but I'm still interested in trying out differnt DE's like Cinnamon and Gnome. The issue is the last two times I tried installing Gnome via PPA base on omgubuntu.com's instructions, it broke unity and I had to fresh install Ubuntu. Granted that was on 13.10. Now I am becoming interested in trying Cinnamon out, but don't want to risk compromising my computer...is it really as simple as this? \nTL;DR Help me install Cinnamon ALONGSIDE my current unity without breaking system.\n\nA: Generally, yes.\nIn the case of variants that are already in the main archive, the installation of the DE and related applications used by that variant (for example, KDE and its default applications in Kubuntu) is as easy as sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop. That being said, because there's no separations between the DE's, you will see programs that are default for Unity appear in KDE and programs that are default for KDE appear in Unity. You might even see two settings menus: one meant for Unity and one meant for KDE. (substitute KDE for Cinnamon here) \nIt may have been that since you were using a Gnome PPA, and since Unity is based at least in part by Gnome, different/unexpected versions of Gnome applications may have caused Unity to stop working. In general, this shouldn't happen for an unrelated DE.\nOn another note, since this is coming from a PPA, it falls on the PPA maintainer to make sure the packages are of a good quality and that there aren't any bugs at the packaging level.\n\nA: If you just want to try them out, I would highly recommend just booting a Live USB of Linux Mint or Ubuntu Gnome. In my experience, the actual distributions are much more reliable than sudo apt-get install xxx-desktop. Although this was also a few versions ago, I too had some really weird things after installing kubuntu-desktop.\n", "Q: Is it possible to access and use all the files in the hard disk in both windows as well as Ubuntu? Is it possible to access and use all the files in the hard disk in both windows as well as Ubuntu?\nAlso;\n\n\n*\n\n*What is a swap area?\n\n*Where can I find someone who can help me with installation?\n\n\nA: Windows uses the NTFS file system by default, whereas Ubuntu uses the ext4 file system. Windows cannot read ext4, whereas Ubuntu can read NTFS. Therefore you have two options, the first one preferable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create 3 new partitions. One very large one for Data (e.g. photos, music, documents) as NTFS that both OS can use. One medium sized one (say 10-20GB) for the actual install of Ubuntu as ext4. And one smaller one (say 4-8GB) for swap.\n\n*Or, if you don't make the Data partition, Ubuntu will be able to see files that are on Windows, but Windows will not be able to see files that are on Ubuntu.\n\n\nIn order to create those new partitions (from the Live USB) you first have to shrink your windows partition (usually OS C:) from Disk Management inside windows.\nThe swap area is basically just extra RAM (much slower than actual RAM of course) that lives on a separate partition of your hard drive.\nAs for actual installation, there are numerous guides available. Refer to any of the following and post a new question if you have a specific problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n\n*Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\n*How to use manual partitioning during installation?\nIf you are unsure, having a friend who is familiar with linux install it for you is a great idea.\n\nA: I'm actually pretty sure that Ext2Fsd has support for reading ext4 volumes. If you don't need to write to the Ubuntu side from your Windows install (just want to see the files, not create new ones) you can install the Ext2Fsd driver.\nThis way you don't have to go about mucking about with you partitions.\n", "Q: How do you limit root to no more than 1 login at a time? I took a practice test for a cert and one of the questions was \"Limit root to no more 2 simultaneous logins, make this configuration persistent between restarts\". I didn't even really know this was possible. Is this just for ssh or could you do this for all terminal access on the machine? If so, how?\n\nA: One way would be to limit the terminals through which root login is allowed. This is done by editing /etc/securetty. Just let securetty contain any two TTYs and you're done.\n\nA: You can edit /etc/security/limits.conf and add:\nroot hard maxlogins 1\nThis will limit the total number of root login shells to 1, and it includes both local and remote access.\n\nA: Nevert tried this but would go the following way: \n\n\n*\n\n*Make bin/bash and other shells unaccessible to root. \n\n*Create script that would run bash if not already running, otherwise exit. \n\n*Assign this script as root shell. \n\n", "Q: What is a \"Swap Area\"? So I noticed this question has not been asked directly;\nWhat is this \"Swap Area\" people keep referring to when it comes to installing Ubuntu?\n\nA: From Community Help:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Swap space is the area on a hard disk which is part of the Virtual Memory of your machine, which is a combination of accessible physical memory (RAM) and the swap space. Swap space temporarily holds memory pages that are inactive. \n  \n*Swap space is used when your system decides that it needs physical memory for active processes and there is insufficient unused physical memory available. If the system happens to need more memory resources or space, inactive pages in physical memory are then moved to the swap space therefore freeing up that physical memory for other uses. \n  \n*Note that the access time for swap is slower therefore do not consider it to be a complete replacement for the physical memory. \n  \n*Swap space can be a dedicated swap partition (recommended), a swap file, or a combination of swap partitions and swap files.\n\nAlso visit:-\n\n\n*\n\n*wikipedia paging:\n\nWith a swap partition one can choose where on the disk it resides and place it where the disk throughput is highest. The administrative flexibility of swap files can outweigh the other advantages of swap partitions. For example, a swap file can be placed on any drive, can be set to any desired size, and can be added or changed as needed. A swap partition, however, is not as flexible as a file, as it cannot be changed without using tools to resize it, generally outside the operating system that uses the swap partition.\nLinux supports using a virtually unlimited number of swapping devices, each of which can be assigned a priority. When the operating system needs to swap pages out of physical memory, it uses the highest-priority device with free space. \n\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/q/4970421 (Difference between virtual memory & swap area)\n\n*Linux.com - swap space\n\nSwapping is the process whereby a page of memory is copied to the preconfigured space on the hard disk, called swap space, to free up that page of memory. The combined sizes of the physical memory and the swap space is the amount of virtual memory available.\n\n\n*Importance of Swap Partition\n\nHope this helps to understand and get basic knowledge about swap.\n\nA: Summary\nThe Swap Area is just fake RAM that lives on your hard drive. It is much slower than actual RAM, but is necessary in many cases to keep a computer running normally. A good rule of thumb is to have as much swap space as you do normal RAM.\nMemory\nYour computer has a couple different kinds of memory that we need to talk about. Your files and operating system are stored on your hard drive (commonly HDD). This is relatively slow and cheap, but is persistent between system shutdowns. Your computer also has RAM (Random Access Memory) which is much faster, more expensive, and loses its contents when your computer loses power. In order to run a program, it is first copied from your HDD to your RAM (which is much faster) so that it can execute in close to real time.\nSwap\nHowever, we should ask the question: what happens if you run out of RAM but want to open another program? The answer isn't good; your computer freezes until there is enough RAM to complete the operation (this is commonly called \"thrashing\"). Although you might only have a few Gigabytes of RAM, most computers have more HDD space than they know what to do with. So we can use some of that extra space as fake \"RAM\" in a pinch. That is what swap space is; emergency RAM that lives on your hard drive.\n\n\n\nNow that we have some swap space on our hard drive, running out of RAM isn't as big of a deal. Now when we run out and wish to open another program, the operating system looks through all of the open programs currently in RAM, and chooses one that hasn't been used for a while. It then copies that program out of RAM and stores it in swap space, freeing up room for the new program. If in the future we want to access the \"swapped out\" program, the operating system simply copies it back to RAM, potentially swapping out other programs in the process.\nPartition vs. File\nWhen creating a swap space, you have two choices. You can make a separate partition on your hard drive, which is recommended in Ubuntu and necessary if you wish to hibernate your system. Or, you can create a Swap File (called the Pagefile in Windows) on your hard drive. Technically a swap partition will out-perform a swap file, but the difference will likely be negligible. Also note that if you have multiple linux distributions on the same hard drive, they can share a single swap partition (swap partitions do not have a file system).\nGuidelines\nIf you are installing Ubuntu for the first time, you might as well make a swap partition. This is the default in the Ubuntu installer, and also my personal recommendation. On the other hand, if you do not have any swap space and would like to add some after installation, it may be much easier and faster to use a swap file.\nIn terms of size, if you have no idea how big to make it, a good baseline (and the default in the Ubuntu installer) is to have the same amount of swap as you do RAM. That being said, this is only a very general guideline, and depends on how you use your system. There is nothing wrong with having no swap space. If you start running out of RAM, just make your swap space larger.\nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu help - Official swap FAQ\n\n*AskUbuntu - how much swap you need\n\n*ServerFault - performance of partition vs. file\n\n*The comments for technical details on partition vs. file\n\n\nA: \"Swap Area\" is the same as the pagefile.sys used for paging in the Windows NT family.\n", "Q: Should I delete all of my partitions while still running windows I want to do a complete install of just Ubuntu Tell me if I'm wrong on this as well delete all of my partitions will make my computer run faster while using just Ubuntu\n\nA: It is very unlikely that you will notice any speed difference.\nThis will not affect the perceived speed of your system, for example ability to multi-task or watch high definition video.\nThe only thing that could potentially be affected are file reads and writes. However, since individual partitions are already contiguous on the hard drive, I doubt deleting other partitions would help.\n", "Q: I am unclear on this: Are WUBI Installations actually supported on Ubuntu 14.04? I am unclear on this: Are WUBI Installations supported on Ubuntu 14.04? Yes; I know it is on the disk, but I find myself confused why it was put back on there, and questioning whether this was an accident or not. After it was taken off of 13.04, I worked under the assumption that it reached end of life, and that people hence forth should be advised to not use it as a tool.\nIs there any official explanation?\n\nA: Thank you to Bodhi.Zazen for pointing this out:\nWindows installer for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onwards\nQuote:\n\nSupport for WUBI has NOT dropped; it is no longer the preferred method though since Windows 8 does not play nice but if you have Windows 7 or older (excluding Windows ME) all you need to do is copy the installer from the ISO and it will install.\n\n", "Q: Trying to remove apache2/httpd and installing mod_perl It started with me trying to install Apache and mod_perl by following this guide.\nHowever, foolishly I installed Apache by using sudo apt-get install apache2, which installed 2.4 on my system. \nAfter running perl Makefile.PL <options> as per the instructions, I got the same error as this guy.\nIt told me I should uninstall 2.4 and install 2.2 instead, which is what I tried to do by doing sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2. \nWhen I ran which apache2 it returned nothing so I assumed it was gone, but when I ran which httpd (which gave a line) and then httpd -V, it gave me:\nServer version: Apache/2.4.10 (Unix)\nServer built:   Aug  6 2014 20:38:13\nServer's Module Magic Number: 20120211:36\nServer loaded:  APR 1.5.1-dev, APR-UTIL 1.5.3\nCompiled using: APR 1.5.1-dev, APR-UTIL 1.5.3\nArchitecture:   32-bit\nServer MPM:     event\n  threaded:     yes (fixed thread count)\n    forked:     yes (variable process count)\nServer compiled with....\n -D APR_HAS_SENDFILE\n -D APR_HAS_MMAP\n -D APR_HAVE_IPV6 (IPv4-mapped addresses enabled)\n -D APR_USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZE\n -D APR_USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZE\n -D SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT\n -D APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD\n -D AP_HAVE_RELIABLE_PIPED_LOGS\n -D DYNAMIC_MODULE_LIMIT=256\n -D HTTPD_ROOT=\"\"\n -D SUEXEC_BIN=\"/bin/suexec\"\n -D DEFAULT_PIDLOG=\"/logs/httpd.pid\"\n -D DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD=\"logs/apache_runtime_status\"\n -D DEFAULT_ERRORLOG=\"logs/error_log\"\n -D AP_TYPES_CONFIG_FILE=\"/conf/mime.types\"\n -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE=\"/conf/httpd.conf\"\n\nSo I tried to remove httpd with sudo apt-get remove httpd but one of the messages was Virtual packages like 'httpd' can't be removed. \nNow I'm really scared to install/remove anything else on my Ubuntu system as I really have no idea what I'm doing.

Still worried about the httpd/apache thing\n\nA: (You could have just run sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-perl2 and be done.)\nIt looks like you locally compiled and installed the httpd binary. If you still have the source true where you ran the make command, you can go in there and run sudo make uninstall. Hopefully, it's supported, and it will remove httpd from your system. If that doesn't work, hopefully, the files will have been installed into the folders in /usr/local, and you can remove httpd-related files manually.\nEdit: It seems make installed httpd into /bin/httpd. After running dpkg -S /bin/httpd to verify it's not part of a package, you can just remove that file. Other than that, things look fine.\n", "Q: Can I write a file with only read permission?

I created a file in /tmp named \"abc\" with content \"foo\", set it read-only (chmod 400 abc), opened it in vim (strace -o vim.log vim abc) and saved it using \":wq!\".\nHere is the strace log:\n...\ngetcwd(\"/tmp\", 4096)                    = 5\nwrite(1, \"\\33[?25l\\\"abc\\\"\", 11)         = 11\nstat(\"abc\", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0400, st_size=4, ...}) = 0\ngetxattr(\"abc\", \"system.posix_acl_access\", 0x7fff5725fd60, 132) = -1 ENODATA (No data available)\nstat(\"abc\", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0400, st_size=4, ...}) = 0\ngetuid()                                = 1000\nchmod(\"abc\", 0100600)                   = 0\nopen(\"abc\", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0600) = 9\nwrite(9, \"foo\\n\", 4)                    = 4\nfsync(9)                                = 0\nclose(9)                                = 0\nchmod(\"abc\", 0100400)                   = 0\nsetxattr(\"abc\", \"system.posix_acl_access\", \"\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x04\\x00\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff \\x00\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\", 28, 0) = 0\n...\n\nWe can see that vim calls stat to get the current permission, then the equivalent of chmod(u+w), then the write, then it restores the original permissions (in this case, chmod(400)).\n\nA: If the file belongs to you, you can always change permissions on the file by calling chmod. I guess editor just alters permissions implicit, saves and reverts permissions. To really forbid writing, you should change file owner too.\n", "Q: Grub Rescue When USB Stick Not Inserted Okay, I did something really sly, thinking I knew all the ins and outs.\nI got a great school laptop with Windows 7 Pro on it.

This like all options will crap all over your ubuntu making it irretrievable to people of my or your skill level. This will hopefully give you an ms-win 8 environment which will access the Internet to download the full operating system.\nIf this doesn't work or is unavailable then phone yes phone Microsoft to get a bootable cd (some drives don't like dvd boot) to get you in a position for an internet download. Or you may have to part with cash to buy a full set of ms-win 8 discs . Remember if you have a contact with these discs and you may borrow those and use your license, that's not piracy.\nYou now have a Microsoft laptop. In microsoft's I control panel defragment and compress your drive. Consider making a d: partition for all your windows data, it helps avoid data loss during future crash recovery.\nYou can now reboot your machine with ubuntu installation disc in, but you need to access the bios by pressing escape,f1,f2,f12 or delete or which ever key it is for your machine. There is a bios option now on ms-win 8 machines to allow multiple operating systems (or disable Microsoft only).\nConsider creating a /home partition during ubuntu install again for data loss avoidance reasons.\nUbuntu should create grub entries for ms-windows on completion.\n", "Q: Installing Wireless Drivers on Yoga 11s Yoga 11s wifi card drivers are not pre-installed.

But if not, or if you don't want to bother with that (which you probably don't), there is a generic solution. Simply copy the archive to some location that you can write to.

I got installed it because my school uses a lot of Linux type stuff in my school's Computer Science program so I figured I would use Ubuntu on my own machine and just do my code from there instead of the computer labs. However, I'm having a lot of trouble trying to install the numerous packages that aren't included natively on Ubuntu. Can someone help me install the PNG library, libpng and zlib. This is just one of many things I need to get on here but I think I need to first start off with this. I did download both packages, did the tar xf thingy on the download, and looked at the README files for insight on installing the software. I get weird errors though. I first tried installing libpng and the terminal was like zlib isn't installed so I was like ok, I'll just get zlib but permission is denied. Do I need to get root or something? I remember seeing people say root before, but I don't know if it is relevant. I'm really new so I don't understand a lot of these things and it's kinda scary. Please help. \n\nA: Ubuntu uses a thing called apt, which is a package manager. It installs, manages, upgrades, and removes programs. If at all possible, you should try to install programs via Ubuntu Software Center. What you were likely attempting to do was install from source, which is only recommended if you know what you're doing. \nTry to get out of the Windows mentality, which is to search google and download an installer. The Ubuntu Software Center searches Ubuntu's online repositories, which are generally guaranteed to work. Programs installed via Software Center or apt will also be updated automatically by Ubuntu's Software Updater.\nYou can install libpng from the Software Center by searching libpng and choosing \"PNG Library - runtime\". Or from here libpng12-0  by clicking \"available on the Software Center\". Or using sudo apt-get install libpng12-0 from a terminal.\nThe zlib1g package should be installed automatically when you install libpng12-0, because it is one of the libpng12-0 package's dependencies. The package manager apt installs all of a package's dependencies before it installs the package.\n\nA: Open terminal by CtrlAltT\nFor libpng, run:\nsudo apt-get install libpng-dev\n\nFor zlib, run:\nsudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev\n\n", "Q: Hybrid Graphics.

I'm trying desperately to uninstall Ubuntu 14.04 and replace it with Windows 7, but I'm encountering serious issues. See this thread: Trouble installing Windows 7 via USB\nTL;DR I have a Windows 7 ISO on a USB that won't boot. BIOS doesn't recognize the USB. I have a second USB also with the ISO, and it recognizes it, but won't boot. I tried to see if a Ubuntu ISO will work, but that also has no effect. I'm taken to the grub screen, I select Try Ubuntu, there's a black screen, and then back to the grub. No purple background either.\nI'm wondering if I can use boot-repair to wipe this HDD, then plug the USB in and install Windows. My concern is that I'll be in the same situation, but without the ability to boot into my computer any longer.\nHere's what I have so far: My OS in use is on /sda2. I have an boot/EFI partition on sda1. Boot-Repair gives me the option to purge and reinstall the grub of /sda2. These are the commands:\nsudo dpkg-configure-a\nsudo apt-get install -fy\nsudo apt-get purge-y-force-yes grub* shim-signed linux-signed*\n\nThe instructions ask:\nDo you want to have all GRUB 2 files removed from /boot/grub?\nYour system would then be unbootable if you don't install another bootloader.\nRemove GRUB 2 from /boot/grub?\n\nTo my noob-ish mind, this sounds like the right course of action, considering literally nothing else that I've done has worked.\nI've tried WinUSB, UnetBootin, Startup-Disk-Creator, when I encounter the black grub screen during boot, I changed the code to nomodetest and that didn't work, I changed the grubx64.efi to fallback.efi, etc. I'm backed up to a wall here. Any help would be great!\n\nA: To answer the question in the title:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I Use Boot-Repair To Wipe My Computer?\n\n\n*\n\n*No, you can't.\nSee Misconception about boot-repair below.\n\nCreating Windows UEFI media\nWith this question you are asking how you can install Windows 7 on your UEFI-capable computer, correct?\nThe commands you pasted look non-functional to me. I'm ignoring everything else in your question because that is irrelevant to installing Windows 7.\nIf you have a GPT partition table on the disk where you want to install Windows 7 in UEFI mode, the installer should be able to create the necessary partitions. You can use GParted in Ubuntu to manage or delete partitions and create partition tables. To create UEFI-bootable media have a look at this Q&A I posted: How to create UEFI-only bootable USB live media? (Yes, you can boot Windows 7 installation media in UEFI mode, I just checked my MSDN W7 x64 ISO and it contains .efi binaries. Yours should be the same, unless it was made by an ignorant haxx0r.)\nThis should get you back on track. If not, assume that your UEFI-capable computer has no operating system installed and you want to install Windows 7 with UEFI-booting from scratch. Ask for advice and instructions where Windows is on topic (superuser.com?)\nMisconception about boot-repair\nAs far as I know boot-repair is a tool for restoring boot functionality to grub installations in case when these don't boot anymore and without asking much questions or doing a root cause analysis. \"Wiping computers\" seems to be out of scope for this tool.\n\nA: No, you cannot use Boot-Repair to wipe your computer. That tool cannot wipe any partition indeed, it is aimed at recovering access to operating systems.\nTo remove Ubuntu and replace it by Windows7, you just need to wipe your hard disk via Gparted (included in Ubuntu disc), then install Windows.\n", "Q: Itunes music folders I have managed to get into the Itunes_Control folder and find all the music files but what I want to do now is put music into it so my Ipod will recognise the new music files and will be able to play them but I have no idea what all the random words or numbers mean, is anyone able to help?\n\nA: It sounds like you want your music player to act like a flash drive, in that you can just drag and drop files.

I don't know the right vocabulary to more succinctly ask this question or to search for duplicates:  Someone who knows what I'm trying to ask, please edit the title of this post to be more accurate.\nThere's a server I'm working on.  It is set up as a proxy server among other things.  The computer I'm working from is connecting wirelessly directly to the DSL modem that the server also connects to.  There is a web-GUI tool (for managing the shared printers) that is available from the server's other network interface.   \nThat is to say, the server has two network interfaces - one that is etho0 (IP address of 10.0.0.3) and one that is eht2 (IP address 192.168.0.1).  The laptop I'm working on is on the 10.0.* network.   I'm trying to access 192.168.0.1:631.  I can ssh to the server.  \nIs there a way I can use ssh to translate connect to 192.168.0.1:631 from the 10.0.* side?\n\nA: You can forward a remote port to a local port via SSH:\n\n -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport\n\nSpecifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side. This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address. Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port hostport from the remote machine.\n\nSo, something like:\nssh -L 1631:192.168.0.1:631 10.0.0.3\n\nNow connect to localhost:1631.\nAdditionally, you can use the -fN option to send this connection to the background.\n", "Q: deb package has no usr/lib after installation I'm building a simple single binary deb package, everything works fine with the executable that is placed in the usr/bin folder and executes when I click the desktop icon. \nNow I want to start programming the functionalities, so I write the bash scripts and normaly the packagebuilder add's them to the usr/lib folder after adding them to the debian/install file.\nBut my deb package has no usr/lib folder after installation, I can add them to the usr/bin folder, but lintian requires a manpage for every file in the bin folder so that's not really an option. \nHow do I get the usr/lib folder?

New computers that ship with Windows 8 also come with a different partition table than before.\nThis along with the move to UEFI causes confusion, as users are unaware of the newer partition table and are trying to install operating systems in legacy style on these computers and vice versa.\n(Non-UEFI installs can be done but need a special partition. UEFI installs on MBR partitioned disks also seem to be possible.)\n\nA: What is a partition table? How is it related to Windows 8?\nIn addition to general partitioning, it should be noted that information about partitions are stored in a partition table on the hard disk.\nThe whole topic didn't receive much attention because DOS/Windows computers – where one would install Linux onto – just had one choice for almost three decades. (MBR was introduced in 1983.) Until Windows 8 finally replaced the long overdue and outdated BIOS/MBR subsystem combination with UEFI/GPT. (Comparison of GPT and MBR on the Arch Wiki.)\nWhile GPT is the name for the new format, there is some confusion about how to name the old one as MBR previously described the bootloader code that is stored along the partition information in the partition table.\nHow do I check and change the partition table?\nRead these instructions carefully before you start!\nAlso note that you can convert partition tables: How can I change/convert a  Ubuntu MBR drive to a GPT, and make Ubuntu boot from EFI?\n\n\n*\n\n*GUI-method - Using GParted\nTo find out what partition table type the selected drive has select View > Device Information from the menu.\n\nSelect the disk of which you want to change the partition, then select Device > Create Partition Table from the menu.\n\nIf you get a warning that the device contains active partitions, unmount these. Note that you cannot unmount partitions of your currently running operating system. You will then see the window below, where you can choose the partition table type. msdos is what GParted calls the old format, gpt the newer one. All the others for other operating systems or architectures.\nPlease also note the warning message. Creating a new partition table will discard all information about existing partitions on the disk. It will not overwrite data on the partitions, but you still don't want to have to dig through and restore data afterwards. Therefore consider the old partitions gone and all data lost after you created the new partition table and backup your data before doing so.\n\n\n*CLI-method - Using parted\nTo display partition table information run:\nsudo parted --list\n\nTo create a new partition table run:\n# This is a destructive action that will destroy all data on the partitions of the device\nsudo parted device mklabel label-type\n\ndevice should be replaced with the device name (e.g. /dev/sdb) and label-type with msdos or gpt.\nYou can also run parted interactively by just running sudo parted.

This will give you some output like the following:\n309M    /opt\n3,8G    /var\n512K    /root\n(...)\n3,5M    /lib32\n\nSave this information somewhere and wait for the system to start filling again. Then, you execute the same command and compare the outputs. This should give you a hint on what is growing and taking your space.\n\n*Then you can use ncdu to investigate further. Supposing that the folder that grow more was /var, you can use sudo ncdu /var. This is a curses application, so you can use the arrows and enter to navigate between the folders and get to the root of the problem.\nBut as I said in the comments, the fact that the space is reclaimed after yo restarted your system points to /tmp. This folder is used to store temporary files and is cleared whenever you restart by default. As you guess, as a server would be rarely rebooted the files there will start to pile up...\n", "Q: How to change permissions on luks-dmcrypt encrypted device?

(this is the case for most tutorials and instructions above)\nSolution:\nWe need to change the permissions of the newly-minted filesystem that is in the encrypted harddisk/file container.\nUsing the example in the example where /dev/mapper/$name has already been mounted to  /media/mount_point with a command like: \nsudo mount /dev/mapper/$name /media/mount_point\nOpen a terminal in your account and type enter this command: \n\nsudo chown -R yourUserName /media/mount_point\n\nFor example if joe has a mount point named myEncryptedHD he should do:\nsudo chown -R joe /media/myEncryptedHD\nWhat this does is Joe changes the owner of all files in myEncrypted to joe, and he now has read and write access. Life is good.\nIf you decide you don't want R/W permissions anymore, just sudo chown -R root /media/mount_point and you'll revoke your rights.\nReferences for chown examples for more complicated permissions handling and a related question on SuperUser with a comment on the answer that also suggests the alternative sudo chmod -R 775 /media/mount_point that will set read write execute permissions on user, group and only read and execute (5) for others. A chmod man page for further info\n\nA: I believe you can change this. After you get Root Privileges\nsudo su\n\nyou should use \nchmod 777 /directory/of/the/device\n\nI am not sure if the device should be mounted or not before you attempt this.\n", "Q: Get back the old tray in Xubuntu Is there a way to go back to toggle the visibility of tray icons in Xubuntu just as it was prior to 14.04 since now Unity indicators replaced the classic tray which I very much dislike because now one cannot show/hide certain apps.\nI did a search in Synaptic but couldn't find such a package.\n\nA: You can selectively hide Unity indicators with the Indicator plugin.

The first field in your text will always be the line number, so we're essentially deleting the line numbers.\n\n*print $0 means \"print all fields\", so we're printing all the fields, but the first field is now empty and won't be printed.\n\nawk messes up the code formatting though.

We're then replacing what we matched with nothing, to delete it. This sed part is used to remove any leading spaces in the file.\n\n*cut is also a text manipulation program that separates the input into fields (using a default delimiter of tab).\n\n*-d' ' is setting the delimiter to a space, so now the first field is our numbers.\n\n*-f2- means print the second field onwards (the last hyphen - means \"onwards\").\n\n\nA: If you want a method that works in a text editor, then you can use the combination ctrlx + r + k to cut a rectangular area of text in emacs.\n\nA: In some text editors like Geany or (Notepad++ only in Windows) it can be done easily.\nJust keep CTRL+ALT and then hold Mouse Left Click and draw a rectangle around numbered area\n", "Q: How to activate script on laptop from smartphone? I want to run a linux script on my laptop remotely from my smartphone (iPhone, namely). \nFor simplicity let's say the script is called myscript.sh and it is located in /root/Desktop. I am running as root user (Yeah, I know what I am doing running as root.) \nFrom the information I have gather these are the possible solutions:\n1. Write some sort of app for iPhone to communicate (Sounds painstaking and too complex for me.)\n2. Sending emails and using the \"Procmail\" thing \n3. Sending emails and using the \"Postfix\" thing\nAll of the methods mentioned above are pretty unknown to me; I haven't heard of them until recently. So can anybody please enlighten me on ANY method that allow me to run a linux of my laptop from my smartphone.\nThank you!\nEDIT: By the way, I have no servers running at home.\n\nA: Option 1: SSH + ngrok\n\n\n*\n\n*I believe SSH server listening on 22 port comes by default on Ubuntu.\n\n*Install ngrok with sudo apt-get install ngrok-client\n\n*Sign up on ngrok.com to get an auth token (needed to use non-http protocols).\n\n*Let local ngrok know about your account echo 'auth_token: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' > ~/.ngrok\n\n*Run ngrok -proto=tcp 22\nYou will get something like\nTunnel Status                 online\nVersion                       1.6/1.6\nForwarding                    tcp://ngrok.com:52418 -> 127.0.0.1:22\nWeb Interface                 127.0.0.1:4040\n# Conn                        0\nAvg Conn Time                 0.00ms\n\nngrok.com:52418 is your local SSH server accessible from anywhere. By default port is given at random, but you can set it in config file. See docs for more info.\nTest it with ssh ngrok.com -p 52418. You can connect to it from any SSH client from your smartphone (I'm using VX ConnectBot) and do everything you can do with command line on your local computer, like executing scripts :]\nOption 2: Simple HTTP server + ngrok\nFor simplified example I will create two files in ~/test/:\n\n\n*\n\n*test.sh, which will output current timestamp and append it to log.txt:\n#! /bin/sh\ndate +%s\ndate +%s >> log.txt\n\n\n*server.py, which will wait for remote HTTP request and execute test.sh:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport http.server, os, subprocess\n\nclass HTTPRequestHandler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n\n        path = 'test.sh'\n\n        # Make path absolute\n        if path[0] != '/':\n            path = os.getcwd() + '/' + path\n\n        # If file exists, execute it and return output\n        if os.path.isfile(path):\n            if os.access(path, os.X_OK):\n                p = subprocess.Popen(path, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n                stdout, stderr = p.communicate()\n                content = stdout.decode('UTF-8')\n            else:\n                content = path + ' is not executable'\n\n            self.send_response(200)\n            self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')\n            self.end_headers()\n            self.wfile.write(content.encode('UTF-8'))\n\n        else:\n            self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')\n            self.send_response(404, 'File Not Found')\n            self.end_headers()\n\nPORT = 8000\nhandler_class = HTTPRequestHandler\nhttpd = http.server.HTTPServer(('', PORT), handler_class)\n\nprint('Listening at port', PORT)\n\ntry:\n    httpd.serve_forever()\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    pass\n\nhttpd.server_close()\nprint('Server stopped')\n\nNow we can make server.py executable, run it, then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in a browser and see that script actually worked — it will output current timestamp in our browser window + append it to ~/test/log.txt.\nBut 127.0.0.1 is just localhost, and we want to reach our server from internet. That's where ngrok comes in. Install it with sudo apt-get install ngrok-client and execute ngrok 8000, it will give you something like:\nTunnel Status                 online\nVersion                       1.6/1.6\nForwarding                    http://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.com -> 127.0.0.1:8000\nForwarding                    https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.com -> 127.0.0.1:8000\nWeb Interface                 127.0.0.1:4040\n# Conn                        0\nAvg Conn Time                 0.00ms\n\nThat https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.com is public address (i.e. accessible from internet) which will be actually served by your local server (which will execute your script, as you remember :)). By default subdomain name is given at random, but you can set it in config file. See docs for more info.\nYou can run both your server and ngrok in background, but that is another story :]\nOption 3: TeamViewer (or VNC + ngrok)\nYou can even have full graphic remote control with TeamViewer host on your laptop and TeamViewer client app on your smartphone. Easy, but could be too traffic consuming for mobile use.\nInstead of TeamViewer, you could probably use VNC server + ngrok on your laptop and VNC client on your smartphone.\n\nA: While this is by no means the fastest or most advanced way to answer your question, I think it is probably the easiest to implement and understand.\nThe method I usually use is to set up a dummy e-mail account and poll it for new e-mails every second. This usually takes around 5-10 seconds from when you sent the e-mail on your phone and until the script runs. Note that you have to enable imap in the e-mail address you create.\nAlso make sure your bash script starts with the line:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nThe python script I use is shown below.

I recommend using grub as your boot loader.\nIf you're willing to try grub, which should give you a menu at startup to choose between the 3 OS, boot Ubuntu from your Live Media and try using boot-repair.\n\nA: Having Windows (No matter what version) is still considered one booting system. Inside the Windows boot manager, both are handled as the same, you only choose which one you want when you are already inside the Windows boot system. In your case you are actually Dual Booting (Ubuntu / Windows). If you choose Windows then you are shown the Windows boot manager which would show Windows 7 / 8. Triple booting would be something like Mac / Windows / Ubuntu (FreeBSD, Microsoft, Linux).\nIn your particular case I would NOT recommend disabling GRUB, since this would be the only boot manager in your case that can handle both, Windows versions and Ubuntu. The Windows manager still has many problems handling Non-Microsoft OSes and your boot section of Linux would be bound to Windows, so any failure (eg: Viruses attacking the boot manager) will also affect if you can boot Ubuntu or not (If the Windows boot manager fails, everything fails).\nI recommend doing the following, since you have all 3 already installed, try to run the grub updater to see if it can show all 3 OSes on the same boot screen:\n sudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Is there a reason the Kernels from the Kernel PPA don't have various features turned on? I tried to use a Kernel PPA version of 3.16 today to debug an issue I've been having. Everything was working well until I noticed that my usual AuFS mounts weren't online. I combine a few directories because I don't have enough space on one drive.\nLong story sort, I found they had been removed from the Kernel. OverlayFS too. It left me scuppered. I'm back on 3.13 now and I know full well how to recompile a kernel, I'm just wondering if there's a technical reason why both AuFS and OverlayFS have been explicitly turned off.\nYou can actually see in the config patch where they've been turned off:\n-CONFIG_AUFS_BDEV_LOOP=y\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_BRANCH_MAX_1023 is not set\n-CONFIG_AUFS_BRANCH_MAX_127=y\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_BRANCH_MAX_32767 is not set\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_BRANCH_MAX_511 is not set\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_BR_FUSE is not set\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_BR_HFSPLUS is not set\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_BR_RAMFS is not set\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_DEBUG is not set\n-CONFIG_AUFS_EXPORT=y\n-CONFIG_AUFS_FS=m\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_HNOTIFY is not set\n-CONFIG_AUFS_INO_T_64=y\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_RDU is not set\n-CONFIG_AUFS_SBILIST=y\n-# CONFIG_AUFS_SHWH is not set\n...\n-CONFIG_OVERLAYFS_FS=m\n\n\nA: The kernels Ubuntu provides in the mainline PPA are unmodified versions of the Linux kernels found on kernel.org. They do not add any extra/additional patches when building them when compared to the officially supported Ubuntu kernel builds.\nAuFS and OverlayFS are not part of the upstream kernel and thus are omitted when Ubuntu builds these mainline kernels.\n", "Q: Open port 8080 on 14.04 I need to insert into iptables to open 8080.\nWith the iptables I looked at iptables -L it is so complicated and has

When I try to log in, it logs me in, I see a the box appear. Then it suddenly switches off. It quits.\n\nA: If you updated from Skype 4.2, this is because the database format has slightly changed. More precisely, the problem is that the format of how file transfer logs are stored differs slightly, and Skype 4.3 crashes right away because it cannot deal with the old format.\nOne possibility, as suggested in the other answer, is to completely remove your Skype directory (i.e., rm -r ~/.Skype). However, this also means that you will lose all your conversation history!\nA much better solution is to fix the database yourself. Make sure Skype is not running, and proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install sqlite3:\nsudo apt-get install sqlite3\n\n\n*Next, issue the following command:\nsqlite3 ~/.Skype/SKYPE_USERNAME/main.db\n\n...where you have to replace SKYPE_USERNAME with your Skype username. This gets you inside Skype's SQLite database. There, issue the following command:\nUPDATE messages\n  SET body_xml =(\n    SELECT SUBSTR( body_xml, files_start, alt_end - files_start ) ||\n           SUBSTR( body_xml, 0, files_start ) ||\n           SUBSTR( body_xml, alt_end )\n    FROM (\n      SELECT msg.body_xml,\n             instr( msg.body_xml, '<files' )  files_start,\n             instr( msg.body_xml, 'alt=\"' ) + 5 alt_end\n      FROM messages msg\n      WHERE msg.id = messages.id\n    )\n  )\nWHERE type = 68\nAND body_xml NOT LIKE '<file%';\n\nAnd quit:\n.quit\n\nAnd voilà! Next time you start Skype and log in, it should work fine, and you'll still have all your conversation history.\nSource: http://community.skype.com/t5/Linux/Skype-4-3-crash-on-ubuntu-14-04/m-p/3349043/highlight/true#M9417\n\nA: I had that problem - I found a post somewhere here about needing to delete the .Skype directory and now Skype 4.3 works.

Clearly, I have to add a SATA controller, but if I'm going to do that, would it make more sense to implement a hardware RAID instead of doing in software as I'm doing now?  Are there any controllers that are particularly recommended?\n\nA: There are no advantages to fake RAID or expensive real hardware RAID controllers that I know of.\nThe advantage of software RAID is that your RAID sets are not dependent on a certain controller or format and that you receive bugfixes and software updates easily through the software update process.\n", "Q: Ubuntu touch channel for Nexus7 2013 What's the recommended channel for Ubuntu touch on Nexus7 2013.

Click Install to go ahead and install the additional components to complete the localization and avoid to be prompted next time you start Language Support.\n\nScroll down to Spanish, and Click Install / Remove Languages to add it.\n\nOnce you’ve made your selection, click Apply Changes to install your new language.  Make sure you’re connected to the Internet, as Ubuntu will have to download the additional components you’ve selected.\n\nType in your password, and then click Authenticate.\n\n \nDrag Spanish to the top of the list, and click on Apply System-Wide.\n\n\nOnce you have your new language settings all set, go ahead and log out and log back in.  Once logged-in, Ubuntu may ask you if you want to update your user folders’ names to your new language, click Update.\n\nThen you can add a Spanish keyboard layout, just follow the following images to do so.\n\n\n\nOnce done, go back into Language Support to change the Regional Format.  See image below.\n\n\nA: Go to Settings->Languages and move Spanish to the top of the list. Then install the suggested packages. \n\nA: If you're on Ubuntu 14, go to System Settings.

Run sudo fdisk -l to see the partitions on all attached drives. The EFI partition has EFI Partition under the Type column.\n\n*Mount it. Suppose your EFI partition was /dev/sda2. Then mount it on an empty folder anywhere.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/efipart\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/efipart\n\n\n*Now we have to find the directory Ubuntu or any other distro's name in this partition. It is mostly under EFI/distro_name.\n\n*Remove that directory and its contents by (EXERCISE CAUTION) sudo rm -r distro_name.\n\n*Install efibootmgr to fix you Firmware's boot entries.\nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\nsudo efibootmgr\n\n\n*The sudo efibootmgr command will list all UEFI boot entries. Look for the one you want to remove and note it's number (like 0001, 0002, 0003 ...) then run sudo efibootmgr -b chosen_number -B\n\n*Reboot and you now have a clean EFI partition and can proceed to installing Windows.\n\n*To check if this worked you should go to the boot menu options (usually pressing F9 or F12 when the system boots) and see if the entry titled Ubuntu or some other GRUB dependent OS is still present or not. If all went well, there should no linux related entries.\n", "Q: How to install gnome shell extensions without installing ppa repo in 13.10?

I am installing Ubuntu 14.04 to an existing W8 installation with 'secure boot' disabled as I could not get the Uefi to pick up the live Dvd. \nThere is an existing partition Sda2 FAT 'Efi System' set up by the original installation. I was encouraged to create a new 'Bios Boot' Sda5 1MiB partition and pointed the installer to 'Sda'.\nThe boot sequence is not automatic and is a mess of selections to eventually get to choose 'boot from hard drive' which then picks up Grub.\nWould it be correct if I deleted the new Bios boot partition on the hope that grub will install on the original 'Efi Syatem' (using Rescatux live Dvd)?\nComments would be appreciated,\n\nA: Congratulations on getting the boot to work.  Let me describe the boot process a little, so you can decide what if anything you want to do about the boot order in the grub menu, which is really another question (answered elsewhere here).\n  Legacy boot uses simple firmware that knows how to start executing at the first block of a device (the Master Boot Block or MBR).  This is grub-pc after you install it -- a small binary blob, which needs more code to do much (the second bigger binary blob called core.img, but since both binary blobs are not even in a filesystem, the concept of a \"name\" is misleading.  On an MSDOS type partition, the second binary blob fits into the partition structure right after the MBR, but on a GPT partitioning, there is no room there, so you need another place, the small 1M partition with the grub-bios flag.  Again, what's in this grub-bios partition is just a binary blob, no filesystem, so not much for you to \"read\".\n  Enter UEFI, with smarter firmware.  Now the firmware knows about FAT filesystems, and can actually be set up to select a file in that type of filesystem -- no more binary blobs to worry about, just files.  You can use any standard file-copy mechanism to move these files, no more special tools needed to write binary blobs into selected block locations on the disk.   Now the location of this FAT filesystem for booting is any partition with the boot flag.  (However, on the current crop of hugh disks, maybe it's still good to keep it near the beginning of the disks).  All the bootloaders you want (space allowing), can go into the filesystem, which uses the standard directory/subdirectory method to keep them separate.  The Ubuntu bootloaders go into the /EFI/ubuntu (kubuntu, ... whatever) directory.  There is really only the new grubx64.efi, but it comes in both a cryptographically signed and unsigned version. Canonical signs the grubx64.efi, which basically still cannot run because the firmware only comes with the ability to run Microsoft signed code (when secure boot is enabled).  So Canonical paid Microsoft to sign a tiny little program which can only run grubx64.efi -- that's the shimx64.efi.  Nothing in this UEFI description precludes the use of the old MBR boot mechanism -- and that's exactly what the live media uses, both of them.\n  I'd suggest reading more about UEFI, and look up the grub menu reordering if you want to change the grub defaults. Good Luck. \n", "Q: how to install ubuntu from a flash drive? I asked this in a less than clear way before. Sorry about that.

You can even add new/other O/S's to the same thumb drive later.\n\nA: I understood your question, my explanation wasn't clear enough.

Thanks in advance!\nUPDATE\nHere's the link to the results of my Boot-Repair\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/8003085/\n\nA: 1)you have to use a GNU parted disk as util fdisk doesnt support GPT\nif this doesnt fix it then,\n2)you have to re-install the hard disk, most hard-disks self install themselves but when you tried to install Ubuntu you could have deleted these drivers. you can search Google on how to do this. \n3)secondly your hard disk could be loose and thus cant communicate with a computer. \n4)last of all this could be because you wrote Ubuntu over windows and now windows cant read the hard disk.\n", "Q: How Do I Create A Bootable Windows USB? I recently used Gparted to resize my partition, so I have 200GB of unallocated space that I want to install Windows 7 to. \nThe problem is, my computer won't let me boot from USB. It let me boot Ubuntu from a USB, but not Windows.\nI'd been having serious issues even creating a bootable Ubuntu USB. Startup Disk Creator, UnetBootin (and UnetBootin 494), WinUSB, etc all didn't work. I kept getting a black screen after the grub, and then returned to the grub.\nFinally, p7zip via the Terminal did the trick, and let me boot into Try Ubuntu, so I could use Gparted to partition the HDD. Now that I have unallocated space, I want to install Windows 7.\nI followed the instructions to put my Windows ISO on a USB via UnetBootin, but my computer doesn't detect the USB afterwards. The instructions say to format the USB as NTFS, and I did. It detects FAT32, but won't boot from it.\nI tried WinUSB, but received an error message at the end of it that stated the USB wasn't an EFI device.\nI've turned off Secure Boot, Fast Boot, and set the USB to boot priority. \nCan I use p7zip again? I tried mounting the ISO, clicking and dragging the files onto the USB, and booting that way (which several instructions had said worked), but nothing happens.\nI'm running out of tools and USBs. I've used 3 already, including a brand new one. Still nothing. I could use some advice!\nEDIT: I tried WinUSB again with a fresh USB. Here's the error output:\nInstallation failed !\nExit code: 512\nLog:\nFormating device...\nMounting...\nmount: block device /home/zachary/Windows7Ultimate/Windows7Ultimate.iso is write-    protected, mounting read-only\nCopying...\nInstalling grub...\nInstalling for x86_64-efi platform.\ngrub-install: error: /media/winusb_target_1407629458_2779 doesn't look like an EFI  partition.\n.\nError occured !\nSyncing...\n/usr/bin/winusb: line 78:  7228 Terminated              while true; do\nsleep 0.05; echo 'pulse';\ndone\nCleaning...\n/usr/bin/winusb: line 78:  7371 Terminated              while true; do\nsleep 0.05; echo 'pulse';\ndone\nUmounting and removing '/media/winusb_iso_1407629458_2779'...\nUmounting and removing '/media/winusb_target_1407629458_2779'...\n\nEDIT 2: When I use UnetBootin, the download completes and asks me to reboot. When I reboot and go into BIOS, the USB doesn't show as a bootable option. It's just not there. It should be noted that my computer came with Windows 8 pre-installed. Would that make a difference? I also can't change UEFI to Legacy from BIOS.\n\nA: I'm assuming you already checked the BIOS settings for boot order etc. since you mention Ubuntu does boot from USB. Also, make sure secure boot is disabled in the BIOS. In some instances, you have to set a BIOS admin/supervisor password before you are allowed to change the setting.\nOther Possible issues could be the thumb drive, the utility you are using to create the windows USB install or the ISO. Are you sure the windows ISO is at all bootable ?\nFor best results, I'd recommend trying the Windows USB download tool\nIf you're sure the ISO is working and feeling a little bit bold, try Yumi. This (free for personal use) utility allows you to place multiple installations on a single thumb drive. With it, you can create a thumb drive which lets you choose between a mix of several windows versions and linux versions for installation.\n", "Q: How to boot Ubuntu 14.04 with grub4dos (RMPrepUSB) After downloading Ubuntu 14.04, I would run it from a bootable USB stick.\nI already have the bootable USB stick with grub4dos, and I was looking for a 'guide post' with the command to boot Ubuntu 14.04.

So here is an update for anyone else interested.\nAs of 2019, cron on Debian will enforce a maximum crontab line count to prevent a malicious user from creating an excessively large crontab. According to the Debian change log:\n\n*\n\n*Version 3.0pl1-133 introduced a limit of 1000 lines on March 10\n\n*Version 3.0pl1-134 relaxed this limit to 10000 lines on June 23\n\nDebian-based distros such as Ubuntu and Mint will likely adopt these changes soon.\n\nA: I am pretty sure there is no limit to the length of a cron file (maybe 65536 chars/lines due to 32bit limits?).\nSome people on Stack overflow and Server Fault thought there was a limit:\n\n(2011) Ubuntu Debian is limited to 256 (and I just ran into that). FreeBSD will happily accept 600 entries. I haven't checked beyond that, but 600 crontab entries ought to be enough for anyone :)\n\nBut that wasn't the accepted answer, this was and it says there isn't one.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be a documented limit to the number of crontab entries allowed. So, short of checking the source code to the specific version you're using, perhaps the BUG entry in the crontab manpage could be helpful:\nAlthough cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character, neither the crontab command nor the cron daemon will detect this error. Instead, the crontab will appear to load normally. However, the command will never run. The best choice is to ensure that your crontab has a blank line at the end.\n\nAnd on Unix and Linux, this was the answer:\n\ncronies limit seems to depend on the filesystem (maximum file size) as the cron daemon stores the crontab entries per user in a linked list - see user.c from cronie for details. This means the maximum number of job entries for crontab is basically unlimited.\n\nSo I'm pretty sure that it is unlimited, but you need to have that blank line at the end. :)\n", "Q: How to block parts of a website I already use the hosts file to get rid of entire domains that are time sinks, but some websites that largely are wastes of time (eg reddit) have useful parts.

But my php site needs to run some shell scripts to run stuff like kindlegen, rsyncing files to another server at user command etc.\nWhats the best (most secure) way to do this?\nthanks\n\nA: Sounds like you're in safe mode. That's fine but it does give you the option of allowing certain commands if they're defined in safe_mode_exec_dir. That would be the first thing I looked at. Create a directory, add your script in there, set safe_mode_exec_dir to that directory and see if it runs.\nEdit: Hmm, if you're on 14.04 it's probably not safe mode. That was removed in 5.4 and you should be on 5.5\nIf that doesn't work or isn't feasible, consider a non-interactive method. Have your PHP write to a file called needstorun and then have another script (running as another user) check that file on a regular basis. I'd use a cron line like this (run crontab -e as the user it's going to run as)\n*/5 * * * *    [ -f /path/to/needstorun ] && rm /path/to/needstorun && /path/to/script\n\nThat's obviously only going to offer you a staggered approach but that might not be a bad idea.\n", "Q: ubuntu file manager: text input for file names (with autocomplete) I use the default ubuntu file manager.

I do not want the global menu bar on top to display, or the side bar with the short cuts to applications to display. I just want a program to execute in full screen, even if the user exits the program. The program already runs in full screen by the way.\nI've tried removing Unity, and when I do that, when Ubuntu boots up, it says that you cannot log into Ubuntu. Does anyone have any suggestions?\nHere's what I've tried:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge unity unity-common unity-services unity-lens-* unity-scope-*\n\nI'm also having difficulties having the program boot on start up, because I'm used to adding the program to execute to the users .profile. Any suggestions for this as well?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: When building a Kiosk, I would first list what is the expected behavior. Expected behavior of a Kiosk should be, from your question :\n\n\n*\n\n*A single graphical application to run fullscreen\n\n*This graphical application is started automatically when the server boot up\n\n*In the case that a user is able to stop the application (on purpose or after an error), this application should be restarted again.\n\n\nI thing that your approach, starting from a full desktop and trying to remove the unnecessary things (like Unity) is not the correct approach. From my own experience, I search what are the minimal components to have to be achieve the above goals.\nFor me, the minimal components are :\n\n\n*\n\n*An X Server, automatically launch during boot time without user login (without any layer like gdm, etc.\n\n*A Windows manager (to draw and manage the window of your application itself) with the ability to remove the minimize, maximize, close, ... button of the title bar. (if your application is already fullscreen by default this component can be optional.)\n\n*A script to check that the application is still running and to restart it in case it is not.\n\n\nSo starting from an Ubuntu Server installation, without any graphical component installed, you will have to install at least Xorg (sudo apt-get install xorg).\nFrom the command line, you can always start the X server with startx.\nTo launch the graphical application together with the X server, you will have to create an .xsession file which purpose is to tell the X server which application to launch after the X server itself.\n\nA: I've covered this a few times on the site and again on my blog (from Ubuntu Server (recommended) or from Ubuntu Desktop).\nI wouldn't mess around with trying to selectively unhook things from the traditional Ubuntu desktop, just load X and the application. It sounds gritty but it's fairly basic and only involves just a few tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling LightDM (if installed) which is what would normally start our X session (echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/lightdm.override)\n\n*Telling X that anybody can start an instance (sudo dpkg-reconfigure x11-common)\n\n*Creating a new Upstart service that starts X and runs either a script or an application directly.\n\n\nThe new Upstart script is the biggest element to the whole thing but loosely consists of:\nstart on (filesystem and stopped udevtrigger)\nstop on runlevel [06]\n\nconsole output\nemits starting-x\n\nrespawn\n\nexec sudo -u pranay startx /etc/X11/Xsession /path/to/application --\n\nAnd you'd save that as something like /etc/init/kiosk.conf.\n\nA: I couldn't really understand your problem very well, but from what i get you have removed the Unity bar right? if yes then this might be the problem since many people have reported problems after removing Unity with no solution found yet so try reverting back to the original settings and as for the full screen thing F11 takes most apps full screen, Firefox, chromium, libreoffice etc. and many game apps already open in full screen so you could just put a task to press F11 when you open these apps instead of modifying a patch. \nTo make apps fullscreen temporarly (one session)\n-change screen resolution so it fits only the application\n-for something a little more permanent you could change xrandr (Ps.

I'm from India and I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my machine since last year and a half.\nSo, my issue is: How should I install Yahoo Messenger on my machine?\nInstalling Yahoo Messenger on Windows machine is just a job of making few clicks and it's ready to use with full set of features. Whereas installing Yahoo Messenger on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is nothing less than a nightmare for me. I tried almost everything from Google search to almost everything to install Yahoo Messenger on my machine but I failed everytime.\nAfter running a search on Google I came to know about Pidgin and Empathy. But neither I found how to use/install Pidgin and Empathy or similar software on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS nor did I find out how to configure Yahoo Messenger with these applications.\nThe questions asked regarding Yahoo Messenger are quite old, so I'm asking this question in current era to find out if there is any easy way invented to install the Yahoo Messenger on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS like one might install it on any Windows machine?\n\nA: To install pidgin, first open the Ubuntu Software Center and search for pidgin. Then click install. To run pidgin, just open the Dash (Canonical icon in the top left) and search of pidgin and click the icon.\nOnce pidgin is open, it will likely prompt you to add an account. If it does not, go to the Accounts menu and click on Manage Accounts. Then click the Add... button to add a new account.\nFor Protocol choose Yahoo. Enter your username and password in the Username and Password boxes. Then click Add to add the account. Click Close to close the Accounts window. The Buddy List window from pidgin should now log in to your Yahoo account and let you chat as normal.\nYour other option is to use PlayOnLinux to try and install the official Yahoo Messenger installer. However, this is unlikely to work, so I won't describe the process here. It crashed when I tried it on Ubuntu 14.04.\n", "Q: Intel(HD) Graphics error installing drivers I have a problem when i want to install Intel(HD) Graphisc driver.I use Intel HD Graphics installer for Linux and after 1 minute of installing come this error :    \nW:GPG error: https://download.01.org trusty InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A902DDA375E52366, W:Failed to fetch http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/dists/precise/steam/i18n/Translation-en  Error reading from server.

Is it possible to quit applications while switching through them with Alt+Tab? When I used a Mac many years ago and you were switching through open applications with (let's say Command+Tab) you could let go off tab and then hit Q to quit the app.\nHow can I do this same thing in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: If you have pushed alt + tab, you should see something like this:\n\nIf you select the program you wish to close and then release tab and press ~ it will open a smaller version of the application in the switcher and it will display the X in the top left corner as such:\n\nIf you click the X it will close the program.\n\nA: Simply press Q instead of Tab, while you are holding Alt.\n(verified in Ubuntu 16.04 so far)\nDetails:\nYou are holding Alt while you press Tab repeatedly to switch to different apps. The thumbnail display of apps is the app switcher, and it won't disappear until you release Alt.  Once the app you desire is highlighted, if you press Q, the switcher will send that app an \"Alt+Q\" command, and the app will close.  You can then continue to Alt+Tab to another app, and repeat if needed.\nNotes:\nThere are some apps like Sublime 2 that do not properly respect the request for close, and only the application window will disappear; it will remain open in the background! If you re-\"open\" Sublime, you'll see your work intact. In fact, if you haven't saved it to disk, you may incorrectly believe you're using your changes, when they are not on disk. To date, this is the only app I've seen disrespect the request for close. YMMV. Be careful.\nDiscovery:\nI know this because I accidentally press Alt+Q all the time when my fingers slip off of the TAB key during Alt+Tab. I found your answer while looking for a way to shut this off. ;)\n\nA: For me it works pressing W instead of Q (after pressing Alt + Tab of course). \nI discovered it by pressing the key accidentally.\nI have Ubuntu 19.10\n\nA: I may have a workaround to quit an application from the switcher:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager and xdotool\n\n*In the compizConfig Settings Manager, go to General->Commands\n\n*Write a command (command line 0 is free) as xdotool keyup Alt; xdotool key Alt+F4\n\n*Go to the Key Bindings tab\n\n*Create a key binding to run the command (Run command 0 is you wrote the command line 1. I assigned the key <Alt>q for myself\n\n\nNow, from the switcher, select an app (Alt Tab Tab) and keep the Alt key down. And press the q key.

In this case, the files were overwritten (1). It's too late for them, sorry. Get them back from the latest backup.\nRegarding the files that are there, we want to remove only files that have been copied over. These files exist in both directories, with the same name, and the same content.  \nSo we look for these files:\nFirst, we cd into src, because it makes the following find commands much simpler, and set a variable to the absolute path of dest:\n$ cd src\n$ destdir=\"$(readlink -f dest)\"\n\nThen, we list all files in src:\n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f\n\nand, for each file found, use cmp to check whether there is a file with the same content in dest:\n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec cmp -s '{}' \"$destdir/{}\" \\; -print\n\nRemoving the files, carefully:\nThese files are the ones we want to remove. But to be sure, we move them into a different directory first - and take a look at the commands before running them:\n$ toDelete=/tmp/toDelete ; mkdir -p \"$toDelete\"\n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec cmp -s '{}' \"$destdir/{}\" \\; -exec echo mv -n \"$destdir/{}\" \"$toDelete\"/ \\;\nmv -n /path/to/dest/./f1 /tmp/toDelete/`\nmv -n /path/to/dest/./f2 /tmp/toDelete/`\nmv -n /path/to/dest/./f3 /tmp/toDelete/`\n\nLooks good!

Then it looks into the directory you copied the files to, and removes only the listed files, as they exist in the source directory.\nThe try element is added to prevent errors, for example in case you might have removed some files manually already, or if not all files from the source directory were copied to the destination.

I do not wish to spend any money on upgrading the RAM. I am simply curious if you could link me a disk image or show me how to directly upgrade Xubuntu 6.04 to 14.04.\n\nA: Just recently put Lubuntu 12.04 on my old imac g3 500.  It was a bit tricky, but here's what happened with me.  Had to start with 12.04 for ppc.  No GUI when I was done, only a command line.  It asked me if I wanted to upgrade to 14.04.1 and since I really hadn't gotten what I wanted, I went ahead with it.  Loaded up nicely and now have a good GUI.  Some minor graphics issues, but very workable.  I did it with 256 MB RAM.  Have since upgraded to 1GB, which was a pretty minor cost and it runs way faster.\n\nA: This won't be a supported action.  While a minimal installation disc would typically be used to build up something anew while working with that memory constraint, the last one released that supports 32-bit PowerPC architecture was for 12.04.  While a mini.iso image for 14.04 does exist it isn't even referenced in the documentation.\nAs noted on Xubuntu's system requirements page:\n\nTo install or try Xubuntu within the Desktop/Live DVD, you need 256 MB of memory, if you are using the Minimal CD, which uses the non-graphical Debian Installer and downloads packages as you install, you need 128 MB of memory.\nOnce installed, you should have at least 512 MB of memory.\n\nYou can attempted the installation but your results may not necessarily be satisfactory in terms of performance.

Similar situation is on 14.04, but now it's really rare behaviour.  \n\nA: If the system is stable in general, that could be individual problems with the applications.  \nThe problems may still be related somehow, like that they are using a common library or subsystem that is somehow broken.\nIn general, it is often useful to try starting misbehaving applications with an empty user configuration.\nThat can be done by logging in as a new user, or renaming (or deleting) the configuration files of the program.\nAlso, take a look at the file /var/log/syslog for obvious problems.\nIf you can list error messages of other failing applications, that would give some hints.\n", "Q: How to get the updates after installing Ubuntu 14.04 I'm having a bit of a problem, before I install Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop as dual boot, I thought of trying it before I jump into any unknown waters..\nMy problem is that I'm not able to install the recommended updates at the time of installation due to some problems I'm having with my Internet connection. \nSo what I would like to know is that, if there is a straight forward method of updating Ubuntu after installation, Or do I have to wait and make sure my internet connection is up before installing Ubuntu for it to be properly updated?\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nA: The fact that you don't have a working internet connection at installation time should not affect future updates in any way.\nYou will be prompted when you have a working connection and any updates are available.\nYou can also install updates manually by using the Software Center, or running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade in the terminal.\n", "Q: Getting List of Running processes and applications How can I see which application and what processes are running recently after the login using terminal command.\n\nA: Generally ps command does it. \nIf you type man ps, you will get the manual for this command, and there you can check which flag you will need.

However that in itself does not provide integrity, because in effect it is trusting the contents of the dsc file to tell me which public key to use to verify the signature on the dsc file.\nIs the gpg signature on the dsc file a critical part of the integrity verification? Could a man in the middle or a rouge mirror serve a malicious version of the file where the warning from gpg is the only indication something bad is happening? Or does apt-get have other means of validating the integrity?\nWhere would I find official documentation on the security model?

These two files are the root of a hash tree, which can be used to validate the integrity of everything in the archive. The gpg signature on Release is the only one which need to be verified.\nThe signature on the dsc file may serve an important purpose before the file is put into a repository and indirectly signed through Release.gpg. Once the file is in the repository, the signature on the dsc file can be ignored.\nHere is how I could manually verify the integrity. As far as I can tell, apt-get source does the same validation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release and http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg.\n\n*Check the signature using gpg --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --verify Release.gpg Release (The public key can also be found in /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg)\n\n*Download http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/source/Sources.gz\n\n*Compare hashes obtained from sha256sum Sources.gz and grep main/source/Sources.gz Release\n\n*Compare hashes obtained from sha256sum pam_1.1.8-1ubuntu2.dsc and zcat Sources.gz | grep pam_1.1.8-1ubuntu2.dsc\n\n*Validate hashes found within the dsc file: cat pam_1.1.8-1ubuntu2.dsc | sed -e 's/^ //;s/ [1-9][0-9]* /  /' | sha256sum -c\n\nA: The reason you see that warning is because the source packages are signed by the developer's own key, while the binary packages you get from the repo are signed by the repo signing key. Since ubuntu-keyring only gives the keyring of the final repo (debian-keyring actually also provides the public keys of all of its maintainers), apt can't find the key and considers the package unauthenticated.\nTherefore, the solution here is to import the key from a keyserver. You can also look up the source package on Launchpad (pam is here), click on the email address of the person who made the last change for a package, and check the key fingerprint from there.\nIn this case, the last person to change the package was Stéphane Graber, and it just so happens that his key is in debian-keyring (specifically, in /usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg).

I understand there are many interlocking layers of applications that can do this and it is not straightforward at all to achieve this behavior. Here is a good resource for background reading:\nUbuntu 12.10 \"Turn screen off when inactive for: Never\" still turns off\nI do not understand some of the parameters controlled by xset. One is the 'expose' or 'noexpose' setting. The other is the 'cycle' time.\nScreen Saver:\n  prefer blanking:  no    allow exposures:  no\n  timeout:  0    cycle:  0\n\nYou can change the value of 'allow exposures' by typing 'xset s expose' or 'xset s noexpose'. Independently, you can control the values of 'timeout' and 'cycle' with 'xset s 0 0'. However I cannot find a decent explanation anywhere of what these parameters do. If you google it, you will just find a bunch of people modifying these parameters to prevent screen blanking without understanding what they do. If you read the 'xset' manpage, you get this:\nThe 'expose' flag sets the preference to  allow  window\nexposures  (the  server  can  freely  discard window contents),\nwhile 'noexpose' sets the preference to  disable  screen  saver\nunless  the  server  can regenerate the screens without causing\nexposure events.  \n\nI can't understand this. Which value is better to disable blanking?\nIt goes on to say:\nThe length  and  period  parameters  for  the\nscreen  saver  function  determines how long the server must be\ninactive for screen saving  to  activate,  and  the  period  to\nchange  the background pattern to avoid burn in.\n\nI guess by 'period parameter' they mean \"the second numerical argument to xset s N N which is described as cycle by xset q\"? And this is only relevant to some sort of alternating-pattern mode of xscreensaver? Again, I mainly want to know which value is best for disabling screen blanking.\n\nA: OK I believe the exposed arguments are related to whether or not windows and there contents are displayed behind the screen saver (this will be relevant to certain screen savers that draw on the screen and the like). So it is in short if your desktop is exposed or not. This is a educated guess, the terminology used is strange I think.\nI do how ever understand this xset s N N as you referenced it, works as follows,\nxset s 60 10\n\nWill set the screen saver to come on after 60 seconds of in activity as represented by the variable 60, and the 10 will force the background image (your desktop if you use xset s expose) to change every 10 (mins or seconds). This is refrenced as s [Length[Period]] in the manual (length of inactivity and period between refreshing)\nSome other interesting commands were s blank / s noblank These are responsible for if you want the screen to fade to black instead of a screensaver.\nxset s blank\n\npreinstalled\nTo enable this or\nxset s default\n\nTo set factory defaults\nFor you if you want it as off as you can do this, one at a time\nsudo -i\n\nxset default\n\nxset s noexpose\n\nxset s noblank\n\nxset s off\n\n\nA: Pls. dig into X11 Protokoll regards the expose events. \nWhile the X11 server can store content of the windows most of the applications will receive an expose event when a part (inkl. the whole) of the applications window becomes visible. \nUsually when there is no interference (such as screen saver, screen blanking) there is no need to redraw the content of such window. If the window is obscured and becomes visible - that is \"exposed\" again, the X11 server will send an expose event to the application again. \nMore info: https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/events/exposure/expose.html\nThus the noexpose parameter in the xset can cause the screen saver to be disabled, but only when the specifics graphics driver implementation (or power settings) cannot restore the screen contents on unblank (which most can do).\nYours, \nJens\n", "Q: Can't swich between Ubuntu and Microsoft and am stuck in Ubuntu. Please help! In order to switch to Microsoft Windows 8.1 from Ubuntu I would go into my BIOS and click F8 to get to a menu where I can pick what to boot from.

After that it should have gone into another menu were I could choose which operating system I wanted to boot into, but it didn't and it went straight into Ubuntu I am trying to fix it and so I went into settings and when I clicked on the section that shows the hard drive space partitioned for Windows it said this:\nUnable to access \"649 GB Volume\"\n\nError mounting /dev/sda2 at /media/jd/543652053651E88E: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda2\" \"/media/jd/543652053651E88E\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: Windows is hibernated, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda2': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

You need to go into the EFI settings, select boot EFI file, then it should give a menu with something like microsoft, ubuntu, blah blah blah. Select microsoft then select the EFI boot file for it and it should start windows. When it starts windows you should shut it down fully instead of hibernating or fast shutting it down. Also, please note that dual booting windows 8.x and linux of any kind is VERY unstable at this point and probably will be until windows changes how windows operates because at the moment trying to chain load into the windows bootloader ends up not going well at all and it is recommended to either use an external usb to boot into a full partition on the drive or even hot swap drives if you are okay with that type of thing.\n", "Q: Is there such thing as an Ubuntu Certification Program, which guarantees compatability?

How is a boot loader different from a bootstrap loader?\nAccording to me, bootstrap loaders are stored in ROM and boot loaders are on a hard disk in the MBR (please correct me if I am wrong). A bootstrap loader is the first program which gets executed after startup.\nNow I am not getting the meaning of these sentences:\n\n*\n\n*After power on, the bootloader is controlling the board and does not rely on the linux kernel on any way.\n\n*The bootstrap loader acts as a glue between the bootloader and the linux kernel.\n\nWhat does it mean and why do we require both of them?\n\nA: I think the reason for a bootstrap has been left out from the answer above.. though there is a lot of good info here.  \nA bootstrap is designed NEVER to change and with minimal functionality. It may have the ability to choose between boot images or update a boot image, but it will lack all the drivers and support that a boot loader might have. A boot loader will usually setup almost all the hardware in a system prior to booting the OS, and may perform diagnostics, and ultimately update and boot the OS. The boot loader in many ways it can be like a mini OS where the bootstrap is completely minimalist and designed never to change.\n\nA: I believe the boostrap loader is basically the first thing loaded after the bios or loaded simultaneously with uefi on computers that have it. It is what selects the hard drive to load from or, in the case of uefi, starts the OS entirely. The bootloader is usually contained in the mbr on bios systems (though grub extends a little beyond the official size of the mbr using links to other parts of the disk and most of it resides in the /boot partition or mount point in the installation partition) or the efi partition on uefi systems. The bootstrap loader is almost completely integrated with the bios on uefi systems and even partially the bootloader on some in some cases. The bootstrap loader, or in many cases the bios for this, sends the init signal to all connected parts of the computer but the bootloader is what actually detects and starts them completely. The bootstrap loader kind of blends software and firmware while the bios is almost entirely firmware (sometimes even hardware on integrated systems) and the bootloader is almost entirely software (please note this is on bios systems, on uefi the bootstrap loader, bootloader, and bios are VERY interconnected and integrated with each other.)\n\nA: I was also searching about it and I had found a conclusion I will share it with you guys (correct me if I'm wrong):\nWhen the power switch is pressed on the CPU starts but it doesn't do anything as no storage devices are detected by it at that time. Then the BIOS comes into play it will do the POST and if the test is successful the BIOS will now search for a way to load operating system.\nThe bootloader is in the MBR and the bootloader knows how to load the operating system... Here comes the bootstrap loader, it's also a code after BIOS post is successful it contacts the bootstrap loader for helping it to connect with the bootloader to load the OS into RAM... so we can say that the bootstrap loader connects the BIOS (firmware) and the bootloader (software)... so that the BIOS will now know how to load the OS into RAM.\n", "Q: Using ubuntu-device-flash on a Nexus N7 only installs the rescue system Following this developer.ubuntu.com guide I flashed my Nexus 7 via # ubuntu-device-flash --channel=trusty --bootstrap, got this [1] output, but after rebooting the following from the Install Ubuntu section doesn't happen here:\nThen, the parts of the images are deployed to the device.

This view shows the pitch (something close to classical spectrogram).\nOn the left of the pitch spectrogram, you can see a keyboard‑like ruler. It will be useful, as you will see later.\nNow click the “Layer” menu, and then click the “Add New Notes Layer” item.\nThe mouse cursor now should look like a cross, which will allow you to draw lines, just like in a piano‑roll view.\nTake a look especially at what's red in the pitch spectrogram… this is typically the notes of the melody. Draw horizontal lines above it, like in a piano‑roll editor.\nYou may play/pause as you want, to hear both the original audio file, with the notes playing above it, as MIDI notes (it uses an embedded DSSI plug‑in as the MIDI synthesizer, so you don't have to bother to install and configure one).\nWhen you are done, you may export your job as a MIDI file: click the “File” menu, then click the “Export Annotation Layer” item, then in the dialog box, choose the file type “MIDI Files (*.mid)”.\nSave the MIDI files, and voilà!\n", "Q: Not all buttons work on PS3 bluetooth remote I have a PS3 Bluetooth remote which I have paired with my Ubuntu 14.04.1 system and a lot of the buttons work (i.e. they generate events which 'xev' can see) however a significant number do not (L1-L3, R1-R3 and others).\nUnfortunately I need those buttons to control the volume so I am looking for a way to map them somehow.\nI know the kernel sees those as events because 'evtest' sees their key presses, however X does not.\nNote that previously I had this working on an older Ubuntu system (10.04.4) by following http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=How-to:Setup_PS3_BD_Remote however that doesn't seem correct anymore (input.conf doesn't hold mappings any more).\n\nA: The buttons are not being seen by X because their key code is >255.\nI tried LIRC to act as a remapping layer (using the devinput driver) but then I lost key repeating which was a deal breaker.\nIn the end I found http://www.thenautilus.net/SW/xf86-input-evdev/ and patched the driver (v2.8.2 on this version of Ubuntu).\nie\nFirst install these packages\nsudo apt-get install git automake autoconf pkg-config xcb-proto xutils-dev libtool xserver-xorg-dev libudev-dev\n\nClone the repo and build\ngit clone git://www.thenautilus.net/xf86-input-evdev\ncd xf86-input-evdev\ngit pull git://www.thenautilus.net/xf86-input-evdev code-remap-2.8.2\n./autogen.sh\nmake\nsudo mv /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/evdev_drv.so /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/evdev_drv.so.orig\nsudo cp ./src/.libs/evdev_drv.so /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/evdev_drv.so\n\ncat > /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-evdev.conf <<EOF\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"evdev keyboard catchall\"\n    MatchIsKeyboard \"on\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*”\n    MatchProduct \"PS3 Remote Controller\"\n    Driver \"evdev\"\n    Option \"event_key_remap\" \"311=76 313=75 318=74\"\nEndSection\nEOF\n\nThis will re-map the right 1/2/3 buttons to volume up/down/mute.\n", "Q: File manager opens twice in Ubuntu 14.04 I have a window of the file manager already opened, and when I click the icon button in the side panel to view that window, another instance of the file manager opens.\nIs this the expected behaviour?\n\nA: This is a known bug that has yet to be fixed.

I created new partitions (making space beforehand in Windows 8). However after the installation the Windows boot manager turns on, with  both Windows 8 and Ubuntu options. After selecting Ubuntu I am getting the same WUBI error as described here: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n Windows failed to start.

You should probably check the manual yourself.\nUEFI firmware update\nThere is the possibility that the UEFI firmware of the laptop does something else than what is expected according to the output from efibootmgr -v.\nBootOrder: 0006,0000,2003,2001\n[...]\nBoot0006* ubuntu HD(2,200800,82000,2f11f25e-4303-11e3-be2a-0c54a5038f2e)File(EFIubuntushim‌​x64.efi\n\nYou should check if there is a firmware update available to update and check again after the update if it fixed your issue.\nPer HDD-default UEFI bootloader\nAnother possbibility is that the default bootloader (\\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTx64.EFI on each HDDs ESP) is always booted (seems to be the case). Check if you can change this behaviour. A fully functional firmware should be able boot the ubuntu or  Windows Boot Manager entries (as seen in the efibootmgr -v output) instead of the default one. I found a related post in a blog.\nMy general advice is too back up \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTx64.EFI and replace it. I prefer gummiboot (tested, works), rEFInd is also possbile. I don't know what boot-repair does or suggest for this.\nThis really seems to be a firmware issue and installing another distribution does not seem to improve on this (I also found a forum post for Fedora with a similar issue).\nSuggested solution\nYou con only boot the \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTx64.EFI file on a harddrive with this laptop, so you need to replace it with something, that can boot more than just Windows. Running boot-repair will not help or make confusion worse.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get gummiboot\nDownload gummiboot from the Arch Linux repositories. (Everything is fine, we are just doing Linus Torvalds style package management. You can find the download link on that page far on the right under Package Actions > Download From Mirror)\nMount the EFI System Partition (ESP) and backup all existing files on the ESP (e.g. use zip or tar). You can put the backup file at the root of the partition, there should be enough space.\nExtract gummibootx64.efi from the package (it's under /usr/lib/gummiboot/) and copy it as \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTx64.EFI to your ESP.\n\n*Configure gummiboot to boot GRUB\nCreate folders along the path loader/entries/ at the root of your ESP and create a file named ubuntu-grub.conf with the following content:\ntitle          Ubuntu GRUB\nefi            \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nYou also need to add the file loader.conf in loader/ to make gummiboot work.\ndefault        Ubuntu GRUB\ntimeout        4\n\ndefault is the title of the default entry to boot. Edit appropriately if you have chosen another title.\n\n*Reboot\nThat's it. Gummiboot will automatically find and create menu entries to boot Windows.\n\nA: WUBI is incompatible with an EFI-mode boot, which is almost certainly what your computer uses if it came with Windows 8 or 8.1 pre-installed. I recommend you delete your WUBI installation and perform a standard EFI-mode installation.

I want to upgrade to 14.04. Can I do this? Also if I can will this replace the 12.04 or will both 12.04 and 14.04 be on here.\n\nA: Yes, you can upgrade 12.04 to 14.04. Using the Update Manager, you can replace the current installation (12.04) with 14.04. The upgrade process will preserve your personal files and documents. You can start the upgrade process by opening a terminal and typing:\nsudo update-manager -d\n\nThe Update Manager will search for available upgrades then prompt you to upgrade. Follow the on-screen prompts until the upgrade process begins. The upgrade process will take several minutes. When it has finished, you will be asked to restart the computer to complete the upgrade.\n", "Q: Why is everything write protected? I have searched and searched and can't find anything specific to my problem.  \nI am a Mac user, new to Ubuntu.  I wiped my HP notebook and installed 32-bit (no choice) Ubuntu.  Then I installed the LAMP server followed by phpMyAdmin.  My html folder was installed inside of root (/).  A shortcut to phpMyAdmin is inside of that.  Every time I try to do anything with web files, I get permission denied.  I created a file with Sublime Text, later double-clicked on it and when it opened in Gedit, I couldn't save changes because permission was denied.  \nI can understand needing permission to write to the root folder.  Why, then, is my www folder, something I would write to often, installed there?  It's useless to me there if I have to jump through hoops to do anything.  As a shot in the dark, am I supposed to create a www folder in my Home folder and map it to /var/www/html or vice versa?  If so, how do I do that?\n\nA: Well, regular users don't get permission to do many things to the file system outside their home directory. I think it's just to make sure that no one accidentally deletes something really important.\nAnyways, about mapping, you can try this: create a folder with any name inside your home directory, open the terminal and use sudo to make a symbolic link in /var/www with the name html which would point to the folder in your home.\nSo for example, in your home, you can create a folder named webdev. Then open the terminal, and do the following:\ncd /var/www\nsudo mv html xyz\nsudo ln -s ~/webdev html\n\nAnd that should do it. Now you can manipulate files in the webdev folder inside your home.\nDo make sure that the webdev folder in your home directory has proper permission to let other users at least access the contents. You can do this easily by right clicking on the webdev folder icon and going to Properties --> Permissions.\n", "Q: Incorrect shell password correct terminal password I'm trying to make some changes from the ctrl+alt+f1 menu, but the shell only rejects my login (\"login incorrect\" message).

Just type vim and press Tab, and you will get the command vim.tiny, which is the correct command.\nIf you need to run VIM by vim command, you should install vim package:\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nYou can read more about differences between them in What features does vim-tiny have?\n", "Q: Unable to upload files (pdfs, images) larger than 1 MB I have recently started PHP and Mysql project development on Ubuntu. In one part of the project I need to upload files. But my script is not uploading anything larger than 1 MB nor does it show any error. Smaller files are uploading fine. So I think my script is ok. Besides I have made suitable changes in both php.ini and my.cnf files. Can someone please tell me other possible reasons for this?\n\nA: You can do it in 2 ways, by editing the php.ini file or using .htaccess\nIf you edit the php.ini file which is located in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\nFind the value that says upload_max_filesize and change it to the value you wish, for example here I have a max upload file size of 100M\nupload_max_filesize = 100M\n\nNow you also need to edit the post_max_size that PHP will work with through POST, for that we edit the value to whatever you want, I recommend same as upload:\npost_max_size = 100M\n\nIn the case you wish to do it with .htaccess, simply create this file in the root folder of you web site and add the following lines:\n<IfModule mod_php5.c>\n    php_value upload_max_filesize 100M\n    php_value post_max_size 100M\n</IfModule>\n\nNote that .htaccess does not work 100% of the time because it depends on Server settings. On your localhost it will work perfectly but if you are hosting on a shared site or an external address, the server might have limits to the max size that can be uploaded.\n\nA: To show errors in PHP, edit your php.ini file and change:\ndisplay_errors = on\n\nRestart your apache server.\nThen in your project config.php file (if you have one), add these lines:\n/* errors handling */\nerror_reporting(E_ALL);\nini_set(\"display_errors\",1);\nini_set('log_errors',0);\nini_set('error_log','path/to/log/file');\n\nDuring development, set display_errors=1 and log_errors=0.\nWhen deployed, change display_errors=0 and log_errors=1.\nThen just be periodically checking your log file for any logged errors.\n", "Q: Installation procedure for numpy and other python-3.4 packages on ubuntu 14.04 I am new to ubuntu and installed ubuntu 14.04 32 bit on my LENOVO hinkpad T410 machine with windows 7 two days ago but since then trying download and install python-3.4 packages (NUMPY, SCIPY) on ubuntu and not getting results.

But for some reason, I need to personally go into the drive and just open the drive before rhythmbox will actually realise the files are still there.\nA partial solution seemed to have been to put the following command into the startup applications list:\n--mount /dev/sdb4\n\nBut that only worked when I logged in and out to test it. It doesn't actually work when booting up.\nEDIT: I've just noticed that the drive is no longer being listed by Ubuntu automatically. I can see it if I look for it under drives, but its not automatically coming up.\n\nA: You need to put an entry into /etc/fstab\nIm not at my pc else i would tell you the line !\nLook at that file, add a new line the same as the line mounting your / partition. Edit the new line to point to your own music partition.\nGoogle fstab, its quite easy to set up and well documented all over the net.\n\nA: Worked out an alternate way to do what I wanted: just change the default directory for Rhythmbox to search for music.

To send data to port 2003, you can open a separate terminal and type:\nnc 127.0.0.1 2003\n\nThis opens a connection to the listening terminal. Anything you type in that terminal thereafter will be sent to localhost:2003 and will output on the listening terminal. Furthermore, anything typed in the listening port will be sent to the terminal output of the other. \nAlso, instead of using the second command you can use the same command you tried earlier instead:\necho \"hello\" | nc 127.0.0.1 2003\n\nThe listening terminal should output hello before closing the connection.\nFor more information, type the following command in a terminal to view the manual:\nman nc\n\n", "Q: var.sh is not exporting the variable using terminal I want to export many paths using a .sh script. after running it nothing is exported I don't know why. so if anyone can advise.\nThis is the script used:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntxtrst=$(tput sgr0) # Text reset\ntxtred=$(tput setaf 1) # Red\necho \"${txtred}## vars ##${txtrst}\" \n\nT_D_L=/home/\nT_D=$T_D_L\n\nafter that I use echo $T_D_L but nothing happens\n\nA: I was using ./script.sh to run, and the correct way is source script.sh\n", "Q: I can't save Steam games to external flash drive because it is Read-Only, help? I researched online for a while and found out to save games to my external I would have to change the properties on my flash drive to read and write. However I do not have ownership for some reason. I then went online and tried to find out how to gain ownership but it denied permission. I was able to change the drive from 0755 to 0777 though. Any thoughts on fixing this problem?\n\nA: You need to type sudo chown instead of chown to gain permission. You will be asked for a password. The device should be mounted at (example) /media/username/devicename .\nsudo chown -R username:username /media/username/devicename\n\nFor permissions:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /media/username/devicename\n\nIf that doesn't work, use sudo to unmount the device like this:\nsudo umount /media/username/devicename && sudo -K\n\nand then remount the device by removing and reinserting it. \n(you will need to change \"username\" and \"devicename\" to the actual names)\nAnother trick that sometimes works is to insert the device and reboot Ubuntu. When you boot and then log in, the device should automount with all the proper permissions.\nFinally, if it's an sd card, don't forget about the lock switch on the side of the device.\nPlease post any errors.\n", "Q: Making full disk image with DD it is possible to make a full disk image with running ubuntu with following command:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/image_name\n\nAfter i make it, how can i restore that image on a crushed system?\n\nA: In addition to hatterman's great answer you can compress the image as it's taken using gzip like this:\ndd if=/dev/sdx | gzip > /mnt/mybackup.ddimg.gz\n\n\nA: Boot from the live cd. Mount your destination media to (say) /mnt.\ndd if=/dev/sdXXX of=/mnt/mybackup.ddimg\n\nTo restore:\ndd if=/mnt/mybackup.ddimg of=/dev/sdXXX\n\nThe destination drive should be the same size or bigger than the original.\n\nA better way is using tar.\nMount the source to /mnt, mount the destination to /home (say)\ntar cvfpz /home/mybackup.tar.gz /mnt\n\nThis can then be restored to any size drive:\ntar xvfpz /home/mybackup.tar.gz\n\n(After mounting source to /home and destination to /mnt.)\nThen just install grub.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu continue working properly after a new motherboard/CPU is installed? So, I installed the new motherboard and new CPU. Then powered on the PC. The bootstrapping went fine and all seems to work. But I have doubts. Do I need to do something?\n\nA: You don't need to do much. As per comments, check for additional drivers. Though, I recommend running a SMART check on HDD if you were manipulating them in process. You would need actions if:\n\n\n*\n\n*You installed something from source with -march=native. -- reinstall it.\n\n*You did some manual non-standart configuration to adapt to hardware -- check if it still works.\n\n*If you had been running Gentoo you would possibly need re-emerging everything because it is attuned to CPU model. All .deb and .rpm distros are attuned to architecture subfamily, so as long as you stay within one it should just work. \n\n", "Q: Open with Open Office I just installed Open Office from the deb package.

How can I tell Ubuntu to always open docx files with /opt/openoffice4/program/soffice ?\nI have Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: You can change defaults by following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open defaults.list by following command:\nsudo gedit /etc/gnome/defaults.list\n\n\n*Wher you find following line which is default for Libre-office:\napplication/msword=libreoffice-writer.desktop\n\n\n*Replace with open-office desktop file:\napplication/msword=openoffice-writer.desktop\n\n\n*Save file and exit.\n\n\nNote: In file /etc/gnome/defaults.list you can change default applications with desktop file (for find extension or app name you can use Ctrl+F and Ctrl+H for replace).\n\nAdditional Information:\nThe file openoffice-writer.desktop should be exist in /usr/share/applications (Recommended to put/use provided desktop file) If not, then you can create as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/openoffice-writer.desktop\n\n*Then put following data in file\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=OpenOffice Writer\nIcon=libreoffice-writer\nType=Application\nExec=/opt/openoffice4/program/soffice %U\n\n\n*Then save and close it.\n\n*Give execution permission by sudo chmod +x /usr/share/applications/openoffice-writer.desktop\nNow set file as default as mentioned first.\n\nNote: Here openoffice-writer.desktop is only suggested example name.

[ -n \"$T_R\" ] means return success if the shell variable T_R is not empty.  The ! in  [ ! -n \"$T_R\" ] negates the test so that success if reported only if the variable T_R is undefined or empty. \nIf T_R is undefined or empty, then the string Message Appear will be echoed to standard out and, since echo will report success, then exit 1 will execute, terminating the script with exit code of 1.\n", "Q: Why is my wireless network adapter acting in a strange way? (Ubuntu 14.04) I have a laptop with Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 wireless network card, and I'm on Ubuntu 14.04. For almost a week I have had a strange problem with my wireless card. When I plug in the power cable, the network card stays connected to the access point, but stops receiving altogether, but works completely normal on battery.  \nFrom the little digging around, I was narrow it down as a power management related issue. By design when I'm running the laptop on battery, the wireless card is in power management:on status, as verified by sudo iwconfig command. When I plug in the power cable, it goes into power management:off status, and stops receiving. Upon manipulating it with sudo iwconfig wlan0 power on, while still connected to the AC power, the power management is turned on, and the card starts to function normally.  \nThe same laptop does not have this trouble when booted in Windows 7, so I don't think it is an OS independent case of faulty component. Is there a sophisticated solution to it, or do I need to rely on some shoddy script to execute sudo iwconfig wlan0 power on, every time I plug in the power cable?\n\nA: Please open a terminal and do:\nsudo cp /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/wireless /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/wireless.bak\ngksudo gedit /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/wireless \n\nWhen the file opens, make the following changes; I refer to the line number in the file on my 14.04 system:\nLine 38: iwconfig_ac=\"power on\" instead of off\nLine 41: *) iwconfig_ac=\"power on\" instead of off\nLine 75: false) wireless_powersave on ;; instead of off\n\nSpacing, spelling, etc. are crucial so proofread carefully. Save and close gedit. Reboot and check:\niwconfig\n\nIf this is unclear, I have posted my amended file here for reference: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8020443/\nOn my 14.04 system, after reboot, power management is on for both AC and battery.\n", "Q: Icons appeared alone and I can't delete them It's very strange, the computer freeze and I restart it.

Sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed\" \nThere are really bad errors on the disk - it's just not yet clear whether they are in one location only, or spread, and whether they increase with time.\nThe harddisk may fail very soon,\nlike \"just now\".\nOr next week, or not at all. \nIf it does ok on a e2fsck test, you cann still not use it for anything important.\nAs soon as e2fsck confirms there are medium errors, best is to just replace it.\nOtherwise, make backups as soon as possible,\nboot a live CD or so (or find a way to unmount/not mount /home),\nand check for bad blocks, like by\nsudo e2fsck -c -v /dev/sdXN\nTake into account that on a larger mechanical hard disk, checking for bad blocks may take lots of time, between hours and maybe a day or two. That is in part because the program needs to check each disk block separately, and take care of problems separately too. But also, if the disk is giving errors when reading, there are lots of retries on multiple levels before e2fsck even knows there is a problem. For each disk block.\nIt may be the right thing to just run e2fsck in auto-repair mode and leave the computer alone for a while:\nsudo e2fsck -p -c -v /dev/sdXN\nSee ubuntuforums: Random freeze and \"Unrecovered read error\" in /var/log/messages for details.\n\nA: The sectors of your hard disk got corrupted.\nDRDY ERR - Device Ready Check Error.\nUNC - Uncorrectable.\nDue to various reasons such as abrupt shut down during extensive write,\nHigh temperature, Read write operations carried out and the quality of hard disk plays a major role in this case.\nOnce a sector got corrupted and if the kernel tries to access those sectors then you will get this error.\nYou can use seatools, to recover from this error temporarily.\nBut will not be to fix this issue forever, It may occur again some times later.\nIf you are lucky, then it will not reoccur for several days.\nBetter backup the data to a new hard disk and replace the hard disk.\n\nA: For me, I got this error when trying to copy disk images that totaled something like 128GB. cp was trying to load the whole thing in memory in order to rewrite it back out and that obviously won't work, so it has to be done in chunks.

I've downloaded Trusty (14.04) and it's an .iso file. I knew what I had to do, I got a thingy to mount the image (Slysoft to be precise) and mounted the .iso and up came the Ubuntu thing running through what to do, so I restarted my machine and it didn't boot with ubuntu, instead it was the normal boot up. (I'm using Vista [the worst os ever made] to be clear). So, I gots to thinking maybe I could just convert the file into a .exe file and then install it through that, but is that possible? If not, what should I do? \n\nA: No, exe and iso are two different files. A exe is a windows executable, while iso is an image of a disk. If you want to replace vista with ubuntu, plug the dvd (usb) in and at boot press a key, typically it says for a second on the screen which key to press to go into the boot menu. From there you choose the usb or dvd and voila, Ubuntu boots up. Then just follow the installation instructions.\nUPDATE: Just use wubi, it's in the iso file. This will only allow you to try ubuntu on your windows partition.\n\nA: I'm afraid not. An disk image (iso) contains more than just an executable. \nThe best to do is to make an live usb stick (or cd) and install it while vista is shut down. \nTo create a live usb stick, you can follow this guide to create an live ubuntu USB or just burn the disk image in an CD/DVD. Then proceed with the installation of ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can not access ubuntu computer on my windows xp pc I can see my ubuntu machine in the work group of my windows xp pc but when i click it says that it is not accessible/no permission/the parameter is incorrect etc.\n\nA: There are a few steps to follow..\nFirst you have to install Samba on your Ubuntu machine\nsudo apt-get install samba smbfs\n\nThen you have to modify smb.conf\nsudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nand find the line\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP\n\nbased on your workgroup inside WinXP, modify this line accordingly.

How to get Ubundu 12.04 64bit for Intel processor for installing in my laptop.?

I just installed Chrome with these instructions on ubuntu 14.04.\nsudo apt-get install libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7\nwget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb \n\nBut I installed it in my home folder. I'm quite new to Ubuntu and not sure where I'm meant to install it? When I run the 'ls' command in my home folder I see the google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb in red. \nCan I move it or do I have to delete and reinstall it somewhere else?\n(How would I delete it?) \n\nA: Kriss, you can simply download the 64bit .deb from Google's site and double click it to open it in the Ubuntu Software Center. From there you can install it, uninstall it, etc.\n\nA: sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb \n\nthis tells Ubuntu to install the .dpkg file on your PC. If you're coming from Windows, consider that file as an MSI installer file. You can easily delete it\n\nA: See Used up software Linux Downloads folder? for a similar question. \nDEB is just a container. the sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb command opened it and extracted the files needed and put them in their right places. \nSo you have nothing to worry about. Delete the deb file. When you install Chrome this way, it gets installed in the right place and from now on Ubuntu will take care of updating Chrome.\nYou could have opened the \"File\" icon on Launcher (the left panel on your desktop, assuming you are using Unity) and double clicked on the deb file. It would have opened Ubuntu Software Center and you would see an Install button there. Installing a deb file in either of these two ways (command sudo dpkg.. or the GUI Software Center) always installs the software in their correct places. It is best not to mess with it and try to install the software in a different folder.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Numeric pad always enter digits In KDE there is an option to keep number work as if it is on:\n\n.\nBut it does not work in edit area of Qt Creator.

So first you need to change your routers subnet. 10.253.0.* is more common for local networks, but you can get away with 10.10.0.* . You are also using a huge subnet mask, while you can use a netmask this large, there is no need to.\nA better configuration would be:\naddress 10.10.0.23\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 10.10.0.0\nbroadcast 10.10.0.255\ngateway 10.10.0.1\n\nYou will have to define a similar configuration at your router. Make sure the static IP is outside the range of your routers DHCP range.\nEdit: Just noticed you mentioned Virtual Box. This answer still might be useful, but instead of 'router', the changes will be configured in virtual box.

On Ubuntu the default shell only supports POSIX features. Is it still possible to write a cross-platform shell script that also incorporates error handling?\nEdit (2014-08-18)\nThe solution I came up with was to auto-upgrade the script if the given shell doesn't understand the ERR trap\n#!/bin/sh\ntrap 'echo \"Error on line $LINENO\"; exit 1' ERR || exec bash $0 \"$@\"\n\nThis allows me to write reasonably portable shell scripts that only require bash if the default shell doesn't support KSH features.\n\nA: If you want to write a portable shell script you should stick with POSIX as that's the most reliable standard in the Unix world.\nRelying in /bin/sh being anything but a Bourne shell is bad style and will likely break sooner or later.\nAs POSIX doesn't support the ERR trap you have to manually add your error handler to any command you want it for, using ||. For example:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nerror(){\n echo \"Error at $1\"; exit 1   ## we don't have $LINENO in POSIX\n}\n\nwhile read LINE\ndo\n  echo \"+ $LINE\"\n  false\ndone < file.txt || error \"while loop\"\n\n", "Q: Linking to man page sections? Online man pages in HTML with section anchors?\nIt would be good to have an online version of the Ubuntu man pages with direct links into subsections. That would allow to point someone to the relevant documentation in many cases - for example in answers of various StackExchange sites.\nI will describe how a full solution might look, and in which ways that would be useful.\nI do not think a complete solution is available somewhere,so the question is   \nWhich partial solutions exist today?\nFor example, somehow systematic ways to search into the man pages, instead of linking, would be a partial solution.\n\nThe man pages at manpages.ubuntu.com solve most of the problem, but they do not have anchors on the headings or sections.\nThat means, if I want to point to the section \"Parameter Expansion\" in \nman bash online, I have to use\n\nSee \"Parameter Expansion\" in man bash\n  [...and use your browser to search for \"Parameter Expansion\"]\n\nThis opens the bash man page at the top, as one long web page.\nIn the shell, I can say\n\nSee man bash | less \"+/Parameter Expansion\"\n\nwhich jumps to the right place at startup.\n\nIt would be really helpful to have link anchors named like the headings they point to. Anchors named by some kind of index number would still help, but require a manual lookup on the actual web page to use it.\nAs it is not difficult on HTML level to add anchors to headings, I'm sure such man pages exist;\nBut is there a collection of the Ubuntu man pages with anchors online somewhere, or at least a good subset?   \nExample code\nThe header of section \"Parameter Expansion\" from\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/bash\nwhich kind-of-redirects to\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/bash.1.html\n       [ ... ]\n       tildes in assignments to <b>PATH</b>, <b>MAILPATH</b>,  and  <b>CDPATH</b>,  and  the  shell\n       assigns the expanded value.\n\n   <b>Parameter</b> <b>Expansion</b>\n       The `<b>$</b>' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution,\n       or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to  be  expanded\n       [ ... ]\n\nTo be able to link directly to this section, we need something like:\n       [ ... ]\n       tildes in assignments to <b>PATH</b>, <b>MAILPATH</b>,  and  <b>CDPATH</b>,  and  the  shell\n       assigns the expanded value.\n\n   <a href=\"#ParameterExpansion\"><b>Parameter</b> <b>Expansion</b></a>\n       The `<b>$</b>' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution,\n       or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to  be  expanded\n       [ ... ]\n\n\nThis adds one tag to the HTML code, and one attribute, the section name without spaces:  \n<b>Parameter</b> <b>Expansion</b>\n<a href=\"#ParameterExpansion\"><b>Parameter</b> <b>Expansion</b></a>\nNow, we can link to the section like \nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/bash#ParameterExpansion\nor even\nmanpages.ubuntu.com/bash#ParameterExpansion \nwhich uses a foot note and is is written like\n[manpages.ubuntu.com/bash#ParameterExpansion][6]  \n\nUse of other reference documents\nIn many cases, there are alternative reference documents available, appart from the man page. These often have a good link structure that is used to link from a table of content to the sections, just what we need.\nBut this does not solve the general problem, as there is no common way to find whether/where such a document existst, and to make use of the link structure.\nFor the bash example used above, the Bash Reference Manual could be used as an individual solution looked up manually:\nBash Reference Manual section Shell-Parameter-Expansion\nwritten as\n[Bash Reference Manual section Shell-Parameter-Expansion](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion)\nProposed implementation\nTo propose actually implementing this idea at manpages.ubuntu.com,\nI filed a closely related bug/enhancement request on the associated project \"ubuntu-manpage-repository\":\nlaunchpad #1355271: Use HTML a tags to allow external links to subsections of man pages\n\nA: Yes, there is, it's http://man.cx/. It aims to have all man pages in one site, also in multiple languages. The anchors are unfortunately not named, but numbered: for example http://man.cx/printf#heading1 will take you to the first heading of the printf man page. Still I think it's better than without anchors ;)\nPS. Add the site to your search engines, then you can simply type man printf in your address bar, and it will take you to the correct page, super awesome!\n\nA: On unix.stackexchange, there are ways described to use the offline manpages as hypertext too. The easiest way for me seems w3mman, which is part of the package w3m, so:\nsudo apt-get install w3m\nWhen you opened a man page, f.e. w3mman man, you can use TAB to navigate to the next link. (Other man-typical keyboard shortcuts work the same: scrolling, searching, quitting :-)\nTo turn off quit confirmation (like man behaves):\n\n\n*\n\n*edit ~/.w3m/config\n\n\n*\n\n*if not existing: cp /etc/w3m/config ~/.w3m/\n\n\n*set confirm_qq 0\nTo replace the normal man command:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit ~/.bashrc\n\n\n*\n\n*add alias man='w3mman'\n\n\n*source ~/.bashrc\nNow man <some command> will use w3mman instead of the normal man :) I like it this way.

On Windows temperature is like 50 celsius to 58 and on Ubuntu 40 to 50 max. Cooling is also much cooler on Ubuntu. I'm wondering what is causing that difference. Can you help me find an answer? Thanks for reply.\n\nA: \nI'm wondering what is causing that difference.\n\nIt mostly depends on what software you run on Windows and on Ubuntu. \nIn general Ubuntu has less software active and Windows tends to pre-load a lot of software during booting to speed things up when the desktop is active. Both might add to lower/higher temps.\n\nCan you help me find an answer?\n\nSure but you will need to do all the work. Download for both Ubuntu and Windows software that can check the load of your system. For Ubuntu you already have top and htop but powertop is a good tool for this. \nAlso take note of your fan: if Windows turns it off on occasion and Ubuntu has it at full speed all the time this will make a difference. And you should also look at the battery when discharging. If your battery life on Windows is better than on Ubuntu you might trade the \"Ubuntu is cooler than Windows\" for a \"Ubuntu lasts not as long on battery as Windows\" where the battery life is drained due to overactive fans. \n(40-50 is nice.

Absolutely impossible.

As far as I know sudo -i option is used so that the dotfiles of the root user are used. But how come this is not required by the original poster?\n\nA: *\n\n*It is a really bad idea to run uTorrent (or any server software for that matter) as root, even if the linked post instructed you to. That is really bad advice. You should create a separate user using adduser and run uTorrent as that user. You don't even need to install it into /usr/local, just put uTorrent in the new user's home directory.\n\n*Is uTorrent really what you need? It is closed source and hasn't been regularly updated. There are various open-source clients available, even the default Transmission has a web interface.\nHere is how I'd do it. Of course if you want a service etc. you'd need to look that up separately. This is just the very simple version:\n$ sudo apt-get -y install libssl0.9.8\n$ sudo adduser torrent\n$ sudo cp ~/Downloads/utserver.tar.gz /home/torrent/\n$ sudo su - torrent\n$ ln -s ~/utorrent-server-alpha-v3_3/ ~/utorrent\n$ cd ~/utorrent\n$ unzip webui\n$ mkdir maint torrents.queue torrents.active\n$ cat << EOF > ~/utorrent/utserver.conf\ndir_root: /home/torrent/utorrent/\nut_webui_dir: /home/torrent/utorrent/webui/\ndir_active: /home/torrent/utorrent/torrents.active/\ndir_completed: /home/torrent/Downloads/\ndir_temp_files: /home/torrent/utorrent/tmp\ndir_autoload: /home/torrent/utorrent/torrents.queue/\ndir_request: /home/torrent/utorrent/maint\nEOF\n$ ./utorrent/utserver -settingspath /home/torrent/utorrent/ &\n$ exit\n\nNow uTorrent runs as user torrent, the web UI is available on localhost:8080/gui, user admin, no password. Files will be downloaded to /home/torrent/Downloads/. If you need to download to any other directory, make sure that the torrent user has write permissions to the directory. If you have a desktop interface installed, you could also run it as your desktop user.\nYou can stop the server forcibly by issuing sudo pkill utserver (which will kill uTorrent), or whatever the recommended way to stop it is.\n", "Q: Can't run Minecraft with Ubuntu or Wine since update to 14.04 I have followed other available advice on Minecraft, Java, etc, but can't find anything that works.

To complete installation at another time, please run setup again.\"  \n\nFollowing any fixes I could find broke so many things on my machine that I ended up doing a powerwash and starting all over again with a fresh install, but I can still not successfully upgrade my kernel or make Minecraft work in wine. \nTo summarize, I have two basic questions:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Why can't I upgrade my kernel? \n\n*Why can't I install Minecraft in Wine as I used to have it?\n\n\nRunning Ubuntu 14.04 with XFCE on Acer c720 chromebook.  \n$ uname -a\nLinux localhost 3.4.0 #1 SMP Thu Jul 24 15:16:00 PDT 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nEdit:  more info\n$ ls /usr/lib/jvm/\njava-1.6.0-openjdk-amd64  java-6-openjdk-amd64   java-7-openjdk-amd64\njava-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64  java-6-openjdk-common\n\n$ java -version\njava version \"1.7.0_55\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.4.7) (7u55-2.4.7-1ubuntu1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode\n\n\nA: I followed the instructions from this YouTube Video: How to get Minecraft on Ubuntu 14.04\nTo update Java:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\nTo install Minecraft:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:minecraft-installer-peeps/minecraft-installer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install minecraft-installer\n\nBut the kernel issue is still a mystery.\n", "Q: How do I fix the duration of frames when using avconv?

I have an Ubuntu 14.04 x64 server with 2 500GB drives (sda and sdb) in a software RAID 1.\nI just had to replace sdb. Adding it back to the array with mdadm and resyncing was a snap. The problem I'm running into is making sure it can boot if sda happens to fail in the future.\nNote: all commands below were run as root\n\n1st try\nMost walkthroughs I've found told me to run:\ngrub-install /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\nWhich is the exact same command I've seen the Ubuntu installer run a hundred times. However, when I ran that, I got:\ngrub-install: error: More than one install device?.\n\nThis has always worked for me. Maybe something changed with 14.04?\n\n2nd try\nSome walkthroughs recommended setting up grub for the new hard drive manually. The grub prompt scares me, but I was willing to try these steps:\n# grub --device-map=/boot/grub/device.map\ngrub> root (hd0,0)\ngrub> setup (hd0)\ngrub> root (hd1,0)\ngrub> setup (hd1)\ngrub> quit\n\nOnly problem? After the first command, I get:\nThe program 'grub' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\napt-get install grub\n\n???\nSo I tried installing grub.\n# apt-get install grub\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nSuggested packages:\n  grub-legacy-doc\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:\n  grub-gfxpayload-lists grub-pc grub2-common\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  grub\n0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 3 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 913 kB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 438 kB of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue? [Y/n] \n\nNeedless to say, I answered no.\n\n3rd try\nGetting desparate, I tried something I was pretty sure was wrong. The official server guide recommends (at the bottom of the \"Raid Maintenance\" section):\ngrub-install /dev/md0\n\nThis was the output:\n# grub-install /dev/md0\nInstalling for i386-pc platform.\ngrub-install: warning: Couldn't find physical volume `(null)'. Some modules may be missing from core image..\ngrub-install: warning: Couldn't find physical volume `(null)'. Some modules may be missing from core image..\ngrub-install: warning: File system `ext2' doesn't support embedding.\ngrub-install: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..\ngrub-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.\n\nScary.\n\nIt looks like grub has been superceded somehow in 14.04, but I can't find any information about how things have changed. I do have a /boot/grub/ directory, so I know some form of grub is installed.\n\nUpdate:\nI was able to run the following commands independently:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\ngrub-install /dev/sdb\n\nHowever, I'm unsure if sda will boot after installing grub on sdb and vice versa. Am I ok?\n\nA: I found the answer. The way to make sure GRUB is properly installed on and recognizes both drives from each is to run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nWhen prompted which drives to install on, make sure all boot drives are selected. In my case, this was /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. Do not select /dev/md0 or any of the other md devices.\n\nA: For what it's worth: I needed to add a delay script to my boot configuration to allow a degraded RAID array enough time to assemble. Otherwise everything worked fine when booting with 2 working drives, but as soon as I disconnected one drive to test the redundancy I ended up in busybox (without keyboard for good measure)!

I installed normal Ubuntu 14.04. I then installed gnome/gnome shell/gdm. I then logged in my user to gnome. Since then I have been configuring my system.\nYesterday, unlock was working fine. Today, the automatic lock screen is not accepting my password as valid. It just takes the input like it's processing it, then takes me right back to the same password prompt. If I click the 'login as a new user' link, it takes me right back to the lock screen. Ctrl+Alt+F1, etc, does nothing.\nI had to resort to a hard boot. I've tried this more then once. (first time was from automatic, idle time lock, second time was from my triggering the lock screen with the keyboard command).\nI'm certain I have my password right, as I am able to get logged in after the cold boot.\n\nA: I could resolve this issue with the following permission changes:\nsudo chown root:shadow /etc/gshadow\nsudo chown root:shadow /etc/gshadow-\nsudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow\nsudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow-\n\nFound here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1006366\nCheck also this question: Lock screen - password incorrect\n\nA: Neither of the other two answers solved the problem for me, but some additional searching led to this bug report:\nsudo chown root:shadow /sbin/unix_chkpwd\nsudo chmod 2755 /sbin/unix_chkpwd\n\nwhich solved the issue for me.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type ll | grep '.Xauthority' and make sure it is owned by you and not root.\nYou can chown it or just remove it, it'll come back! Now just log out and log back in. \nThis is one of the main reasons why you shouldn't use sudo to open GUIs, as root will take ownership of some of your files in your home directory.\n\nA: I had a similar issue after upgrading to 20.04. If I suspended the computer and tried to log back in I could not enter my password at the login screen.\nI was able to fix this by purging and then reinstall lightdm the issue was solved.\nSo\nsudo apt purge lightdm\nsudo apt install lightdm\n\n\nA: I had an issue like this, my password was not getting accepted from the GUI login page. Then I logged through the recovery mode and did following:\nsu # followed by root password\nmount -o remount,rw /  \nmv .bashrc bashrc_old\nmv .profile profile_old\nreboot\n\nNow logging in with password will work again.\n\nA: I faced the same problem. As I found out, it was caused by setting the DISPLAY variable in my user's .bashrc (and .profile) to 'localhost:0.0'. After commenting this definition out, I was able to log in to GUI. Otherwise, only terminal login (ctrl-alt-F1 or ssh) was possible.\n\nA: Neither of the 5 answers solved my problem, but this did on Ubuntu 18.04:\nI remembered what language/keyboard layout I have used last before letting the screen locked, then I entered my password in that language, despite what language was shown in the lock-screen app.\nThere is a bug in the lock-screen app which doesn't change the keyboard layout despite it shows it was changed.\n", "Q: hadoop home depricated I installed hadoop but I'm getting the following error.

Correct one is hadoop version ( in hadoop 2.4.1)\nIt seems that java path is not set. It is required to run hadoop.\nType java -version in the terminal. You should be able to see output of Java Version installed. If not, install java jdk\nType sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk and install Java OpenJDK.\nNow set JAVA_HOME variable in \n 1. /etc/environment file \nOpen /etc/environment by typing sudo gedit /etc/environment in terminal.\nAt the end, Paste this line export JAVA_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/\" where this is the java path. Usually this is where java is installed.\n 2.   .bashrc file (different for each user) \nOpen .bashrc file by typing sudo gedit ~/.bashrc in terminal.\nAt the end, Paste this export JAVA_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/\" where this is the java path.\n 3. Now reload settings by typing source /etc/environment and source ~/.bashrc in the terminal \nTest it by typing echo $JAVA_HOME in terminal , it should show your java home directory.\nDo the same for to set HADOOP_HOME variable also.\n\nA: Don't worry about the $HADOOP_HOME is deprecated warning for now. Your issue is that Hadoop doesn't know where your java is installed, it's looking at a path that doesn't exist.\nOne of the steps of installing Hadoop is editing the file /home/ramesh/work/hadoop-1.1.2/conf/hadoop-env.sh and changing the JAVA path to point to the correct path on your machine, and then running that script. Did you do this step?\nI think you're the same user that asked the other question here: Not getting `hadoop -version`, and I mentioned hadoop-env.sh in my answer. Are you following a guide to install Hadoop? Make sure you're following one. Most guides online will tell you about these steps. \n", "Q: Where is keyboard extra settings menu? Where is this menu in original Ubuntu ? I got used to it with KDE. I miss it. Really. \n\nPlease, no alternatives. I want that menu exactly\n\nA: Current state of the keyboard extra settings menu\nIt's a shame you already put a bounty on your question because it looks like a duplicate. Check these out: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to use Alt+Shift to switch keyboard layouts?\n\n*How to access the Keyboard Layout Options in 13.10+\nSeems like this menu was still accessible in Ubuntu 12.04 but then scrapped and reimplemented as part of GNOME's ongoing effort to \"simplify\" things.\nAs pointed out in the answers I've linked to, there are several bug reports concerning the removal of these settings, this one being the most prominent. \nApparently some, but not all, of the missing settings have been moved to gnome-tweak-tool (typing section), so you might want to check that out to see if the options you're looking for are there. \ngnome-tweak-tool is part of the official repositories and can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n\nWorkaround using setxkbmap\nOverview\nWith that said: \nThe keyboard options in Ubuntu and GNOME are nothing but a frontend to the X keyboard extension (XKB). If you are fine with configuring things manually you can easily reenable all of the now-missing options with a setxkbmap command line.\nAnatomy of a setxkbmap command\nYou can supply setxkbmap with several options at once. A very simply command to set two keyboard layouts (Russian, English) and Alt+Shift as their toggle would look like this:\nsetxkbmap -option grp:alt_shift_toggle -layout ru,en\n\nYou can chain different options by separating them with a comma. What follows is a setxkbmap command that sets up the same keyboard layouts as above, adds Alt Gr as a level 3 modifier, and assigns the compose key to right Super/Win:\nsetxkbmap -option grp:alt_shift_toggle,compose:rwin,lv3:ralt_switch -layout ru,en\n\nAvailable options\nThere are a multitude of options controlled by setxkbmap. All of these are documented in the XKB base settings list. This file should be available on your system under /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst.\nIf you look through it you should be able to find all of the options equivalent to the settings removed by GNOME.\nThe various XKB settings are also documented under man 7 xkeyboard-config.\n\nAlternative to setxkbmap\nIf setxkbmap doesn't work for you, you can try setting the XKB options through dconf instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-editor (sudo apt-get install dconf-editor)\n\n*Open dconf editor from your dash and navigate to org → gnome → desktop → input-sources\n\n*Add your XKB settings to xkb-options in form of an array. E.g.: ['grp:alt_shift_toggle','compose:rwin','lv3:ralt_switch']\nSource: Make setxkbmap preferences being set at startup\n", "Q: Mounting a USB external drive question I have a Thermaltake hard drive dock that I use to access data on my many hard drives. I have one internal drive that I keep mounted all the time for music, etc but I like to pop drives in and out with my dock. Is there a way to have any drive that is added to the dock mount to the same location every time?\nLet's say I have a 3TB drive, 2TB drive and a 1TB drive. When I put the 3TB in the dock, I would like it to mount to /mnt/winexternal. Later on in the day, I want to dock my 1TB drive, and I would like it to mount to the same location as the 3TB was previously /mnt/winexternal and so on with the 2TB drive.\nIs this possible? I am on the most recent version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: To do that, you need to specify where every partition is mounted  in fstab.\nTutorial\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of every of your hard drives you like to mount in one and the same folder.\nPlug the HDD in and run\nsudo blkid\n\nand copy the UUID of the drive you want to mount. Write it down on a piece of paper or, for less typing, in a text file. Repeat for all three disks.\n\n*Create the main folder for your mounts.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/winexternal\n\n\n*Create a symlink for each of your drives.\nsudo ln -s /mnt/winexternal /mnt/drive1\nsudo ln -s /mnt/winexternal /mnt/drive2\nsudo ln -s /mnt/winexternal /mnt/drive3\n...\n\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab to specify a mount point for each of your drives.\nAdd the following lines to the end of the file. (Make sure to create a backup first!).\nUUID=<UUID_OF_DRIVE_ONE>    /mnt/drive1    ntfs    auto,defaults    0    0\nUUID=<UUID_OF_DRIVE_TWO>    /mnt/drive2    ext4    auto,defaults    0    0\nUUID=<UUID_OF_DRIVE_THREE>    /mnt/drive3    vfat    auto,defaults    0    0\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholders <...> with the actual UUID of the drive and adjust the filesystem type (ntfs/ext4/vfat) to match with the drive.\nNow, when you plug in a drive, you should be able to see it's contents in /mnt/winexternal. If you then unplug it and plug in the next one, the folder will show it's contents and the same goes for the third drive.\nCAUTION\nUnmount the disk before you pull it out. Else, the other drives can't be mounted until a reboot.\nAlso, make sure that only one drive is connected at a time, else... well, I don't know, but something like your computer bursting into flames or something like that. ;)  \nNo seriously, DON'T DO IT!

[Y/n] Abort.\nskath@tahiti:~$\n\nThis leads to the next question, what's taking over stdin when you're calling sudo apt-get upgrade? That's a trickier question and might involve your sudo configuration or the terminal or shell you're using to invoke the command...\nOr, if you just need a workaround, you can pass -y to apt-get to skip the prompt: sudo apt-get -y upgrade\n\nA: I just had this problem on 18.04.2.  update, update, and dist-upgrade worked fine; install, failed with an abort.  Yes, using -y worked.\nHowever, I found that there was a problem in my /etc/apt/sources.list file, and that by restoring it to the default that came with the distribution (you can find your version online easily enough), that completely solved the problem.\nI suspect that one of the alternate third party library scripts that was adding its own repository made a mistake.\nI'd recommend making a backup copy, try replacing the file, ensuring the ownership and permissions are the same as the original, and then doing a sudo apt update, then try your install.\nI haven't had any problems since.\n\nA: I was having the same problem trying to install php. I changed sudo apt-get install to sudo apt install and that worked for me. That may help you or not\n\nA: Try to run the following, and if helped, tell me in the comments what did you do before just running apt-get:\nperl -MFcntl -e 'fcntl STDIN, F_SETFL, fcntl(STDIN, F_GETFL, 0) & ~O_NONBLOCK'\n\nExplanation: apt-get (and many other programs) expects STDIN to be in blocking mode. Some rouge programs leave it non-blocking. Curiosity made me ask you to find out, document and maybe file a bug with those rogue programs. Other way to solve: run bash and type exit to return to the current bash. Bash will set things correctly upon entering.\nFYI, the problem can be induced by running:\nperl -MFcntl -e 'fcntl STDIN, F_SETFL, fcntl(STDIN, F_GETFL, 0) | O_NONBLOCK'\n\n\nA: my problem was that I tried to run several commands at once by copy-pasting them into console\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\napt-get dist-upgrade\napt-get install build-essential\n...\n\nCalling each command separately solved my problem\n\nA: This problem happened for me when I copied and pasted the command from the website (docker.com, particularly). Look like there are invisible encoded characters on the site that prevent apt-get to process. What I did to solve this is to paste the command to the browser address bar first, so the browser eliminates all the weird characters and then, copied it again from the address bar and pasted it again to the terminal. The browser address bar is the best tool to remove those characters, IMO (worked for me most of the time)\n", "Q: Transfer \"BackinTime\" saves from old PC to new one I'm changing my pc for a newer one. For two years, I have been keeping weekly \"saves\" using BackinTime. These saves are very helpful: they help to quickly go over the whole history of a project. Now, I'm wondering, is there a way to use these backintime saves from another PC than the one used to create them and, if yes, how (if it helps, currently these saves reside on an external HDD)? \n\nA: That's one of the biggest advantage of BackInTime! You can access the snapshots from everywhere. Even without BackInTime because they are just normal files which you can browse with every file browser.\nBut you can also install BackInTime on your new PC and just copy over the config file ~/.config/backintime/config or reconfigure everything in the same way like on your old machine.\nYou will have to uncheck Auto Host/User/ProfileID in Settings > General Tab and change Host and maybe User to match the name and user of your old PC. After that is done all your snapshots should show up in BackInTime again.\nDisclaimer: I'm member of BIT-Dev Team\n", "Q: Dropbox not running after logging off: init.d vs. dropbox.py I'm inheriting admin control over a server used to process and share data between investigators. We've been trying to use Dropbox to share some of the files. Dropbox was installed when I took over the server, so it seemed like an easy method. However, I can't get Dropbox to stay running consistently.\nI initially linked my account to Dropbox using the GUI in an X session. I added the Dropbox CLI interface (dropbox.py) and an init.d entry to start it as a daemon, using one of the many examples I found online (currently init.d script is modeled after this one, see below for the actual script).\nWhen I reboot the server calling service dropbox status returns that it is running, but dropbox.py states it is not, and nothing syncs. If I manually start using dropbox.py, everything syncs - but the dropbox service reports it as not running. If I manually start via service dropbox start, the service reports itself as not running but dropbox.py reports it as syncing. Whenever I log in and fix it, everything seems to run fine for a day or two, but then it stops syncing again.\nI've tried killing the init.d script, removing all entries and reinstalling. I've tried reinstalling Dropbox via command line. I cannot seem to figure out what the issue is, and the examples I'm finding elsewhere all assume the server is running headless only (which it isn't - several users are primarily accessing it via remote desktop).\nI don't care if Dropbox starts on GUI login or not, I just want it running in the background at all times, whether I am logged in or not. And I definitely don't want it to stop if I log in (either CLI or X session), which I have read can happen depending on how it's started initially.\n(Dropbox 2.10.3, x64, on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS)\nAny suggestions?\ninit.d/dropbox script in use (example here uses dummy user name):\n\n#!/bin/sh\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides: dropbox\n# Required-Start: $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog $named\n# Required-Stop: $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog $named\n# Default-Start: 2 3 4 5\n# Default-Stop: 0 1 6\n# X-Interactive: false\n# Short-Description: dropbox service\n### END INIT INFO\n\n# Replace with linux users you want to run Dropbox clients for\nDROPBOX_USERS=\"my_user_name\"\n\nstart() {\n  echo \"Starting dropbox...\"\n  for dbuser in $DROPBOX_USERS; do\n    HOMEDIR=$(getent passwd $dbuser | cut -d: -f6)\n\n    DAEMON=$(find $HOMEDIR/.dropbox-dist/dropbox-lnx.* -name dropboxd)\n\n    if [ -x $DAEMON ]; then\n      HOME=\"$HOMEDIR\" start-stop-daemon -b -o -c $dbuser -S -u $dbuser -x $DAEMON -p \"$HOMEDIR/.dropbox/dropbox.pid\"\n    fi\n  done\n}\n\nstop() {\n  echo \"Stopping dropbox...\"\n    for dbuser in $DROPBOX_USERS; do\n      HOMEDIR=$(getent passwd $dbuser | cut -d: -f6)\n\n      DAEMON=$(find $HOMEDIR/.dropbox-dist/dropbox-lnx.* -name dropbox)\n\n      if [ -x $DAEMON ]; then\n        start-stop-daemon -o -c $dbuser -K -u $dbuser -x $DAEMON\n      fi\n  done\n}\n\nstatus() {\n  for dbuser in $DROPBOX_USERS; do\n    dbpid=`ps -u $dbuser -o pid,cmd | grep \"$HOMEDIR\"/\"$DAEMON\"\\$ | awk '{ print \\$1 }'`\n    if [ -z $dbpid ] ; then\n      echo \"dropboxd for USER $dbuser: not running.\"\n    else\n      echo \"dropboxd for USER $dbuser: running (pid $dbpid)\"\n    fi\n done\n}\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n\nstart)\nstart\n;;\n\nstop)\nstop\n;;\n\nrestart|reload|force-reload)\n\nstop\nstart\n;;\n\nstatus)\nstatus\n;;\n\n*)\necho \"Usage: /etc/init.d/dropbox {start|stop|reload|force-reload|restart|status}\"\nexit 1\n\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\n\nA: I've been using the script at http://www.dropboxwiki.com/tips-and-tricks/install-dropbox-in-an-entirely-text-based-linux-environment which had been working previously, but when I check today it wasn't working.\nEventually I found that the line\nDAEMON=.dropbox-dist/dropbox\nneeded changing to\nDAEMON=.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\nNow it works.\n", "Q: finger print sensor for project I am an engineering student and I am doing my minor project which uses finger print sensor and I am using R30x series.

Is it bug ?\n\n\nA: Short answer:  When you installed Ubuntu, the installation have used the whole drive as 1 LVM partition, and that's why you can't create another partition, since there is no space left.\nSee if this helps you shrink the partition.\n", "Q: Managed vs. Unmanaged switch for Beowulf cluster I am setting up a very small Beowulf cluster with one master node (my Lenovo laptop) and two server nodes (Dell Optiplex 760s), all currently with Ubuntu 14.04. Can I get away with using an unmanaged consumer-grade switch? Or do I need a managed one?\nNote: There will also be one other user on the network (on his own laptop) that will not be taking part in the cluster but will still need to use the internet connection.\n\nA: I think you do not need the extra features from the managed Switch if you intend to stay with just two server nodes. Managed switch is useful when you need e.g. customized each port or you need network segments to see each other. I think you can have an unmanaged switch and you may use only what Linux provides for your network setup.\n\nA: Unmanaged Switch, is not configurable, and it doesn’t have any configuration interface and options.  You just plug, and go.\nManaged Switch, support many methods to change the setting, by connecting it using a console cable to to configure the operation of switch, you can use telnet, SNMP, SSH, SSL to manage the switch also. \nManaged switches are the way to go. But, a managed switch cost a lot more than a non-managed one.  If you have no use for the extra features that a managed switch offers, my advice is to take the unmanaged switch.\n\nA: To expand on @allan's answer: you don't need a managed switch. You could likely run a dozen nodes or more on a consumer grade switch.\nReasons to upgrade would include the higher throughput (packet per second) typical of managed switches, and the ability to run redundant switches. Some managed switches allow ports to be bundled into a group to increase bandwidth and/or redundancy. (see LACP and Linux ethernet bonding.)\nManaged switches often include the ability to monitor usage which can be useful to help manage a cluster. This is nice to have, but not required. You can do the same by monitoring the network usage on each node.\nManaged switches are typically about to isolate traffic into virtual LANs (VLANs). This would be useful to segregate the compute traffic from storage traffic. You can do the same with two dedicated unmanaged switches.\n", "Q: Need driver for an Epson WF-3620 printer Does anyone know where I can get an Ubuntu driver for the Epson WF-3620 printer?

The -n +1 instructs tail to start reading the file from the first line. Using -n -10 would start with the last ten lines of the file.\n\nA: Use\ntail -f -n +1\n\nUsing man tail will give you more details, the relevant excerpt follows.\n<snip>Numbers having a leading plus (`+') sign are relative to the\nbeginning of the input, for example, ``-n +2'' starts the display at the\nsecond line of the input.</snip>\n\n-f      The -f option causes tail to not stop when end of file is\n        reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to\n        the input.  The -f option is ignored if the standard input is a\n        pipe, but not if it is a FIFO.\n\n-n number\n        The location is number lines.\n\n\nA: Try this:\nwatch tail {filename}\n\nwhere {filename} is the file that you want to keep an eye on.

How to install MATLAB in Ubuntu 14.04? I searched in USC, but it only has some extension for MATLAB.\n\nA: Matlab isn't included in the Software Center because it's a closed source and proprietary program. However, just downloading the installer for Ubuntu (R2013a specifically) from MathWorks and using all default settings worked fine for me on 64-bit 14.04.\nIf you downloaded it, you'll have to unzip it first.

For my first bash script, I want to create something that's really been annoying me: when I switch folders, I want the contents of that folder to be displated automatically. I tried adding this following code to ~/.bashrc:\nalias go='cd; ls'\n\nSimple enough I thought! Not so. While typing go /etc does indeed list the contents of /etc, my working directory hasn't actually changed, I'm still in the one I was in before. How do I remedy this?\n\nA: In your example, go /etc will do cd; ls /etc. That means, first, cd will change the current directory to your home directory. Then, ls /etc will display the contents of /etc.\nYou could achieve what you want by defining a function, like so:\nfunction go() {\n    cd \"$1\" && ls\n}\n\nOr just type it in the command line on a single line:\nfunction go() { cd \"$1\" && ls; }\n\nThen go /etc will do what you want.\n$1 refers to the first parameter passed to the command in this example /etc. You can refer to subsequent parameters with $2, $3 and so on.\n\nA: You may want to combine this with the built-in bash directory stack (dirs).\nthis will give you the opportunity to type: go ..., to view the previous folder(s) in your stack, rather then type their name. an eg:\nfunction go() { \n if [ \"$1\" == \"...\" ]; then popd >/dev/null ; else pushd \"$1\" >/dev/null ; fi\n ls $@\n}\n\nyou can substitute ... with other keyword, like _back. something that wont be a directory name.\nyou will notice the ls $@ which means all remaining parameters will be passed to ls. so if you want to go and have long listing, or reverse time listing, use:\ngo /var -l or \ngo /etc -ltr\n", "Q: How do I move thousands of files from a list? So, I have a list of files in a text file. I believe it's about 100,000 files.\nThe files in said list are spread across many directories, have different sizes, filenames, extensions, ages, etc.\nI am trying to find a way to move those files, and just those, to another drive.\nComplicating factor: some of the files have the same name, but are not the same file. They can't just be moved into one folder with an overwriting or ignoring policy towards multiples.\nPreferably, I would like them to retain their directory structure, but only have the files that I want inside the destination directory. (the destination drive isn't big enough to simply copy everything).\nBelow is an example of some lines in the text file that has the names of the source files:\nmedia/dave/xdd/cruzer/F#(NTFS 1)/Raw Files/Portable Network Graphic file/3601-3900/FILE3776.PNG/Windows/winsxs/amd64_microsoft-windows-o..disc-style-memories_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7600.16385_none_51190840a935f980/Title_mainImage-mask.png\nmedia/dave/xdd/d1/other/hd1/Program Files/DVD Maker/Shared/DvdStyles/Memories/Title_content-background.png\n\n\nI have tried to use\nrsync -av `cat /sourcefile.txt` /media/destinationhdd\n\nwhich complains that there are too many arguments.\nAlso\nrsync -a --files-from=/sourcefile.txt / /media/destinationhdd\n\nand\ncat /sourcefile.txt | xargs -n 200 rsync -av % /media/destinationhdd\n\nHowever, this just tries to copy my root directory to the destination. \n\nHow do I just copy the specific files that I want to?\n\nA: Here is a little shell script for you:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwhile read line\ndo\n    DIR=`dirname \"$line\"`\n    mkdir -p \"$2/$DIR\"\n    mv \"$line\" \"$2/$DIR\"\ndone < $1\n\nUsage (assuming you saved the script as script.sh and made it executable with chmod +x script.sh):\n./script.sh input.txt output_directory\n\nIt will move all files listed in input.txt to output_directory, using their original paths, for example, for an input.txt has the following list:\ntest.txt\ndir1/test.txt\nAnother Test/something_else.txt\n\nThe files will be moved to:\noutput_directory/test.txt\noutput_directory/dir1/test.txt\noutput_directory/Another Test/something_else.txt\n\nI did some testing before posting this answer, but please make sure you try it on a smaller sample first to confirm it's working as expected!\n\nA: The following script first copies the directory structure from the source, then the files from your list into the corresponding folders. The line if not line in [\"\", \"\\n\"] is to prevent errors in case the filelist contains empty lines.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\nsource = \"/path/to/source\"; target = \"/path/to/target\"; filelist = \"/path/to/filelist.txt\"\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(source):\n    for dr in dirs:\n        dr = root+\"/\"+dr\n        destdir = dr.replace(source, target)\n        if not os.path.exists(destdir):\n            os.makedirs(destdir)\n\nwith open(filelist) as lines:\n    src = lines.readlines()\n\nfor line in src:\n    if not line in [\"\", \"\\n\"]:\n        shutil.copyfile(line.replace(\"\\n\", \"\"),\n            line.replace(\"\\n\", \"\").replace(source, target))\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as move.py\n\n*Add the appropriate paths in the head section\n\n*Run it by:\npython /path/to/move.py\n\n\nA: You can do this with xargs fairly easily.\nmkdir /newroot/\n<filenames.txt xargs -I% bash -c 'mkdir -p /newroot/$(dirname \"%\" && cp \"%\" \"/newroot/%\"'\n\nThe tough bit is making sure the new directory structure exists. For that we use dirname to get the directory names, mkdir -p to build them and finally cp (or mv) to copy/move from one to the other. I've left it in copy mode so you can test.\nI would suggest testing that find /newroot/ -type f | wc -l and wc -l filenames.txt both give you the same number afterwards.\n", "Q: What's the default 14.04 /etc/default/grub file contents?

For custom-built systems, there really isn't a foolproof way to check other than installing it and seeing if it works. That being said, Ubuntu works out of the box with no extra work required on probably 80% of systems I've installed it on.\nFor best performance in applications requiring 3D hardware acceleration (i.e. gaming) using nVidia cards it is a good idea to install the official closed-source nVidia drivers as described here.

I believe Windows or Mac OS X would never allow this.

If that script goes berserk it could output a file that grows and grows on the server until there is no more space available. Even overwriting system files.\nIs there any way to ensure that root, or any process on a system from any user, never fill the hard disk to capacity?\n\nA: A \"Custom script is set to run as root\" sounds risky. Are you sure it must be? \nYou could create another partition, and have the script write output there. Then, it will only fill that partition, and the script will fail without troubling the system.  \nWhile the script is running (running away) use lsof (See man lsof for details) to see which file(s) is/are growing, seemingly without bound.

The OS which I'm running in virtualbox needs as much RAM as possible and I've only got 3.9gb of the stuff, so what do you recommend? I want the virtual machine to run as well as possible, and there will be no other program's running on ubuntu while I'm running the virtual machine.\nThanks!\n\nA: I am fortunate enough to have 32 GB of the stuff, so I give it up to 10 or (once) 18, but my host is permanently using 10GB because I use both.\nI would advise you go for 1500MB, as that should run reasonably well. You might find it runs smoother (even in the VB) if you use an alternative Desktop Environment (DE) such as XFCE or similar.

I just installed an Ubuntu 14.04 server, and I've discovered that there is no way to make any changes to the network configuration except by rebooting the server.  This is on a stock install of Ubuntu 14.04 server, installed last week, with no changes made to it, and no new packages installed (since I can't reach apt-get).\nifconfig up/down seems to read from some kind of cache; at least, it ignores any changes I make to /etc/network/interfaces.

Thanks).\nADDING INFORMATION REQUESTED BELOW:\n/etc/network/interfaces originally was:\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\n\n... this wasn't picking up gateway information from DHCP, even though my Ubuntu laptop picks it up just fine.\nSo I changed it to:\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 172.47.23.106\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 172.47.23.1\n\nHowever, after doing ifconfig down/up, the IP address of eth1 did not change and the gateway did not get added to the route table.  On a full restart of the system, the eth1 configuration was picked up just fine.\nSo it seems that ifconfig up ignores changes to /etc/network/interfaces.\n\nA: The correct way to get the system to re-read and use the changed /etc/network/interfaces file is:\nsudo ifdown eth1 && sudo ifup -v eth1\n\nThe '-v' for verbose should produce output to judge if the changes were made successfully. Check:\nifconfig\nping -c3 www.google.com\n\n\nA: Based on follow-ups elsewhere, I found that it is indeed the case that Ubuntu will completely ignore changes in /etc/network/interfaces for a device which was previously defined and then changed.  In order to get it to take a new configuration, you need to run the following:\nifdown {device}\nip addr flush dev {device}\nifup {device}\n\nThis is run between ifdown and ifup.  Ideally, Ubuntu should add the flush to ifup.\n", "Q: How to use make without an install.txt I am trying to install JRE 1.7_67 from the source tarball.\nIt does not come with an INSTALL file.\nHow do I compile the package and install it without one?\n\nA: It wasn't a source package, it worked by converting the rpm to a deb installer\n", "Q: How strong is a HDD I got a new hdd, I ended up scratching it (my case has alot of holes that are sharp) I'm not sure if i messed up anything, do you guys think it damaged the outlet? What does the outlet do anyway? I didn't plug anything in there but i'm not sure if this would effect me in the long run.  (the red circle is where it got scratched)\n\n\nA: Hard disks are special in these ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*They do not like to collide with hard and heavy things.\n\n*They really do noy like hitting anything at all while they are running.\nOtherwise, they are just devices you should better not pour coffee on, and better not touch if you have electrostatic charge on you.\nSo: the hard disk does not care how you scratch the outside.\n\nA: There will probably be no damage to it.  But it's impossible to tell just from that picture.  In general, you're more likely to damage a drive from impact (shaking the stuff inside) then from scratches to the outside.\n\nA: Scratches on the outside case of a hard drive won't hurt it.  The \"outlet\" is a set of jumper pins used to change the electronic state of the drive circuitry.  You usually don't need to mess with them for a typical computer configuration.  You can check the documentation for the drive at the manufacturer's website if you want to know what the function of each jumper is.\n", "Q: What is the best way to enable more than one network interface in a preseed (trusty)? I need to enable both network interfaces on nodes that I deploy using MAAS.  What is the recommended way to do that.  Right now, only a single interface (eth0) is getting enabled.  Do I modify the preseed file?  If so, is there a directive to enable it, or does it have to be some kind of post-install script?  I just need the interface enabled for DHCP.\n\nA: As long as i know, it is not possible to do this directly in the preseed file. The only way to activate an additional interface is by running a post-install script rewriting your /etc/network/interfaces file. The way to go is to use the 'd-i preseed/late_command' section in the preseed and there somehow download a script, make it runable and then run the script to set up your network.\nI tried this for a couple of hours but did not succeed, it seems like even if your post install script modifies your /etc/network/interfaces, your modifications are somehow overwritten again, cf. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2219851 . So i decided to just add machines modify then manually and the use them.\n", "Q: Wine complete removal from Ubuntu 14.04 I have installed wine from Ubuntu software centre but I don't need that & want to remove the software completely from my system so please tell me How to completely remove wine from Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: Open the terminal by pressing Control+Alt+T and type:\nsudo apt-get remove wine\n\nThat will uninstall wine but if you want to get rid of wine and anything related to wine run:\nsudo apt-get purge wine\n\n", "Q: What happens when you force quit a `mv` directory operation between two disks? Another way to word the question is...\nWhat happens when you mv a directory between two disks?\nDoes it move one file after the other, or does it copy all files to destination, then then delete directory from the source?\nIf it copies everything first then deletes it, I can presume it is safe to force quit the mv operation.  Otherwise, it can be dangerous and cp may be preferred for more intensive/larger moves.\n\nA: When moving a directory, all of it's contents are copied before the original gets deleted. In other words, yes, it is safe to interrupt a mv command when moving a single source, such as a directory - even though it might have files and subdirectories, it's still a single source.\nNote that this is not the case when moving multiple sources with one command, such as:\nmv a.txt b.txt /somewhere/else/\nmv *.txt /somewhere/else/\n\nIn these examples, files will be moved one by one, so if you interrupt the command, you will not find the files that were already moved in their original place.\n\nA: If you are interested in these details of how to do intensive or large move operations,\nthere is a tool that will support all ideas you can think of. And then some.\nrsync\nIt can be used to copy, move, synchronize files locally and remotely, in more ways anybody could ever need.\nThat comes with a back side: man rsync describes more options than anybody could ever read.\nIt supports interrupted operations, continuations, partial transfers, difference based transfers - you name it.\n", "Q: Error while updating to 14.04 LTS I have an Ubuntu 12.04 virtual machine that I was intending on updating to 14.04 LTS. Whilst in the process, the update complained about lack of disk space in \"/\". I searched around for a fix of this and found that I was able to free up considerable disk space using advice from this link: Not enough free disk space when upgrading .\nAs per the top advice, I decided to use apt-get purge on all previous kernel versions minus the latest and (latest-1) versions. After I restarted the VM, it took me into GNU GRUB to ask for which version to start in (it usually never did that) and it leaves me 4 choices, 2 for Ubuntu 3.2.0-67 & recovery and 2 for memory tests. Any of these choices now just return the following:\nerror: file not found.\nerror: you need to load the kernel first.\n\nI basically cannot get back into the OS. Have I lost my VM by accidentally deleting too many images? Any way to recover?\n\nA: It sounds like GRUB only knows of the kernels you've deleted and not the ones that still exist.\nI suggest running a boot-repair. On a VM (of which I've never tried boot-repair before), you should try starting the VM, booting to a live USB or DVD (iso file works), installing boot-repair, and running it. Hopefully that will fix your options upon normal boot so that they contain boots with kernels you have.\n", "Q: Bookmarks, Places nautilus sidebar position Ubuntu 14.04 12.04 shows my bookmarks at the top of the side panel. After upgrading to 14.04 it shows Places, Devices, Bookmarks, Network.\nIs there any way to move Bookmarks top of the side panel or set position for these items? \n\nA: No, there is no way you can do that in the standard file manager for Ubuntu, but there is a way in Nemo: a fork of the built-in file manager (a big brother some might say) but available in a PPA.\nHave a look at their official web-site first.\nPPA's contain unsupported software so you should always be careful and make a personal judgement before installing any PPA's even when given in an answer on Ask Ubuntu. That being said, I've been running Nemo for over 6 months now and would not go back ever.  :-) \nTo install this PPA, go to a terminal and type the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/nemo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo\n\nand put your bookmarks wherever you want them, have advanced list options, built-in terminal, sticky zoom options, ...\n", "Q: Citrix Receiver on Lubuntu 14.04 32-bit I see that Citrix Receiver is currently available for Ubuntu 13.10, and there are threads about installing it on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.

I can't get the Citrix Receiver Engine to always open the \"launch.ica\" file in Chromium, and in Firefox it is necessary to click the block at the left-hand end of the address bar and select \"Allow and remember\", but it's certainly much easier to get it running in Firefox.\n", "Q: Does the Ubuntu kernel have EFI stub loader boot support?

Are there any GUI programs available on Ubuntu that can be used to edit MIDI files? \n\nA: MuseScore can edit MIDI files. MuseScore is already available in the Universe repositories, so you can install it with\nsudo apt install musescore\n\nHowever, the Universe often contains outdated versions of programs. If you want to have the latest version, you can add the MuseScore PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mscore-ubuntu/mscore-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install musescore\n\nThe PPA works with all versions of Ubuntu 16.04 and above.\nUpdate: the musescore package no longer exists in Ubuntu 20.04. However, the similarly-named musecore3 package looks like it's more-or-less the same thing.

The keyboard I am trying to create has a lot of Unicode and looks like this:\n\nBeing unsuccessful with the following tutorial:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Howto%3A%20Custom%20keyboard%20layout%20definitions\n(There are a few errors in the tutorial, and it uses imprecise language such as \"Cutting\" things instead of \"Deleting\" them, and it is formatted strangely)\nI was wondering if anybody would be so kind to provide a better tutorial with step by step instructions?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04, keyboard layouts are kept in \n/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/\n\nEach of the files in this directory contains a series of entries of the following type:\n\n    key <AC01> {[a, A, aacute, Aacute]};\n\nThis entry maps a key on the keyboard to a number of specific characters using the following conventions:\n\n\n*\n\n*<A C01> The first letter A indicates we are looking in the alphanumeric key block (other options include KP [for keypad] and FK [for Function Key]); \n\n*<A C 01> The second letter C indicates the row, counting from the bottom in which the key is found. (In a standard US keyboard, the space bar is in row AA and the number keys are in row AE).\n\n*<AC 01> The numbers 01 indicates the position of the key, counting from the left and ignoring any specially named key like TAB or ~ (tilde): AC01 is in the third row up, first key over from the left (ignoring Caps Lock, if present); on a standard US keyboard, this is the key marked “a”.\n\n*The brackets enclose the list of characters assigned to each key. This contains up to four entries, separated by commas: \n\n\n*\n\n*a - The unmodified key.\n\n*A - The Shift character.\n\n*á - The Alt Gr character. (aacute)\n\n*Á - The Shift+Alt Gr character. (Aacute)\n\n\n\n\nCreating a custom keyboard map is as easy as replacing the characters you don’t want in a given line with the ones you do!\nFor example:\nAs an Anglo-Saxonist, I type á and Á much less frequently than I type æ and Æ. \nTo add the Anglo-Saxon characters to my list, I simply replace aacute and Aacute with the entity names or Unicode code points for æ and Æ (“aelig” or U00E6 and “AElig” or U00C6, respectively):\n\n    key  {[a, A, aelig, AElig]};\nor\n\n    key  {[a, A, U00E6, U00C6]};\n\nWhen I am finished modifying my keyboard layout, I save the file with a new name, \"oe\" in the same directory.\nAdding a new keyboard layout to evdev.xml file.\nIn order to use new keyboard layout, We need to tell X11 that it exists. In Ubuntu 14.04 X11 keeps track of installed keyboards in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml file. Then lets add the new layout in it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml in an editor\n\n*Go to the end of the <layoutList> section (search for </layoutList>). Add the following after the last </layout> tag, where X is the file name of your keyboard layout in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols (in my case oe); Y a suitable short name; and Z an appropriate long name in one or more languages and aaa a legal three letter (ISO 639-2) language code (e.g. eng for English):\n<layout>\n <configItem>\n   <name> X </name>\n   <shortDescription> Y </shortDescription>\n   <description> Z </description>\n   <languageList>\n      <iso639Id> aaa </iso639Id>\n   </languageList>\n </configItem>\n <variantList/>\n</layout>\n\nHere it is, follow complete introduction\nOther related links:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=188761&p=1092145#post1092145\nhttp://www.charvolant.org/~doug/xkb/html/index.html\n\nA: Note: Wayland does use xkb, but many xTools have stopped working properly (xdotool for example)\nNote: This is a non-exhaustive tutorial.

HOWEVER, after about a minute or so, the assigned static IP address vanished. The address is lost and the machine is unreachable. This happens over and over no matter how often I bring the interface up or down. Why is this happening?\n\nA: The issue was Network Manager.

I just installed 'Sublime Text 3' and for some reason I can't install the 'package manager'. Anyway, I want to try uninstall it but I can't find it in my 'ubuntu software center'. \nOn this page it says to type this into the command line: \nsudo rm -r /opt/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2\nsudo rm /usr/bin/sublime\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/sublime.desktop\nsudo sed -i 's/sublime\\.desktop/gedit.desktop/g' /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\nOn this page it says to install synaptic and from there install and remove packages. Or to to delete it with:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge <package-name>\n\nOn this page it says to use:\nsudo apt-get remove sublime-text-installer\n\nif I installed it with (which I didn't but I want to understand this in general): \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer\n\nIt also says that if I installed it through 'ubuntu software center' or through running:\nsudo dpkg -i sublime-text_build-3047_amd64.deb\n\nThen I should remove it by running:\nsudo dpkg -r sublime-text \n\nCan I always run 'sudo dpkg -r programX' from anywhere in my terminal to remove a program I installed with 'ubuntu sofware center' or with 'sudo dpkg programX.deb'?\nWhich method should I use to make sure a program is completely deleted? The first instructions make me a bit scared that it is installed all over the place. Why doesn't all installed software come up in 'ubuntu software center'? Is there not one place where I can delete a program like in windows' add/remove programs?\nWhat do I need to know about installing and uninstalling programs in ubuntu (14.04)?\n\nA: Assuming you followed the instructions on the github, I would suggest that you use ppa-purge to remove the 'deadsnakes' ppa\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes\nUpdate your path to remove the path extensions added as instructed at the github, and most of lime should be inactive.\nAs for removing it entirely, the manner in which it was installed may require looking into the makefiles to determine what directories need to be deleted.\n\nA: I would not recommend using those instructions, as they are incorrect (the sed -i command doesn't even exists).\nBoth apt-get remove --purge and synaptic do what you need (in fact, synaptic is based on apt-get), the main difference is that synaptic uses a graphical interface, including a search tool both for installed and uninstalled packages.\nIf you are not sure about the package name for the application, you should use synaptic, and type its name in the search box. It will provide a list of related packages, marking the installed ones with a blue square. Right click on them and select \"completely remove\". Once you got all the packages selected, click apply.\nFor more information about apt-get, type man apt-get\nFor more information about synaptic, read the wiki.\n\nA: Everything Is Possible With Software Centre\nJust hold with me.\nSee, not everybody has Sublime Text 3, but given that it's still a programme, the process shall be like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Software Centre\n\n*Go to History\n\n*Check the package you think is related to Sublime Text 3.\n\n\nI'm attaching a picture here of the screen one can expect via these steps. \nSometimes, the software might have a different name and package name, like the package of Color Chooser is gtkcolorpick.\nIf you search with \"Color Chooser,\" you won't get any result. You shall go to the History section and look for any packages that you think or which look like related to your app.\nThen, remove them.\nSo How Do You Remove A Package Via History?\nWell, you note down the name. Suppose I want to remove dh-apparmor (which I don't). Now, I would search exactly that in \"Installed\" section: \"dh-apparmor\". If it doesn't show your app's name yet, click on \"Show Technical Terms.\" It'll surely show up now.\nJust click on that package and uninstall it!\n", "Q: Error while opening software center While opening the software centre I am getting the below error.\n2014-08-11 21:57:11,945 -

I was really lazy and always relied on Firefox to remember my login info. I've recently had to replace the hard drive in my laptop. I bought an USB drive adaptor and manager to save all my music and files that weren't backed up after a week of transfer time.\nI'm wondering if I can do the same thing with passwords and usernames that Firefox stores when you tell it to remember a password? If so, how exactly would I do it?\n\nA: That's a Firefox question. Firefox stores passwords and usernames in a strict manner. You cannot just export and import it, it's confidential data.\nIf you used to save login details, you must've had a Firefox account (Sync). Please make use of that.\nOtherwise, this website is of no help to you.

How do you get rosegarden to play sound when playing a midi in it? Do I need Jack running?\n\nA: You do not need to have Jack running in order to playback MIDIs with Rosegarden.\nWhat I now have running is MIDI file playback via Rosegarden and QSynth. \nThe process as of Ubuntu 17.10 is largely the same as here, but follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*install QSynth apt-get install fluidsynth\n\n*install a soundfont library apt-get install fluid-soundfont-gs\n\n*configure QSynth to Enable MIDI Input by checking the box in Setup > MIDI \n\n*configure QSynth to use alsa Audio Driver under Setup > Audio\n\n*configure QSynth to use the soundfont under Setup > Soundfonts; point to /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2 or your soundfont location\n\n*allow QSynth to restart when it prompts you\n\n*install Rosegarden apt-get install rosegarden\n\n*with QSynth open, launch Rosegarden\n\n*Tell Rosegarden to play through QSynth Studio > Manage MIDI Devices and set the General MIDI Device to whatever QSynth broadcasts as its MIDI input option, ie 129:0 Synth input port or similar.\n\n\nA: The documentation says:\n\nRosegarden includes synth plugin support for sample-accurate synthesis of MIDI tracks.\n  […]\n  And as well as plugins, Rosegarden can communicate with any number of standalone soft synths for Linux using the ALSA sequencer MIDI protocol.\n\nSynth plugins usually are very specialized; if you want to play some random MIDI file, you probably need a general-puporse software synthesizer like Fluidsynth or Timidity.\n\nA: I adapted the Rosegarden+Qsynth answer to work without having to open 2 different windows, as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Install fluidsynth and rosegarden, as well as the corresponding soundfonts via apt\n\n*Add the following function to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases:\n\nmidy() {\nif [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n  rosegarden \"$1\" &\nelse\n  rosegarden &\nfi\nfluidsynth -a alsa -m alsa_seq -o midi.autoconnect=True <PATH_TO_YOUR_SF2_FILE>\n}\n\n\n\n*Open a new terminal: type midy and load a MIDI file, or midy <PATH_TO_MIDI_FILE>, and hit play: rosegarden should open, and fluidsynth should play the file in the background, without the need of a Qsynth window!\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*To test that fluidsynth is working, you can try the corresponding command (after the fi) separately, by adding the path to the MIDI file at the end. It should play the file.\n\n\n*In my case the .sf2 files were installed under /usr/share/sounds/sf2\n\n\n*You can find further options by checking man fluidsynth and fluidsynth -o help\nHope this helps!

I have scanned the drive using GSmartControl and it shows no errors in extended Self-tests or any other test type.\nI have also applied updates, changed drivers, and reinstalled twice (one was mint 17). I have formatted the partition and scanned it using Windows and no errors came up. \nI am unsure what to do in order to solve this. If my drive is failing, then why am I getting no errors when I scan it? Also why does Windows 7 work flawlessly on it?\n\nA: I believe I found the solution to my problem. I'm not quite sure what it was, but it seems to be related to the hard drive. \nFirst, I used Ultimate Boot CD, and wiped my drive by overwriting everything with 0s. Then I formatted my drive for a dual boot with Windows 7. \nI have been playing around in my installation for about 2 hours now, and so far I am crash and system freeze free.

I recently tried installing Ubuntu 14.04 on a new Asus VivoPC vm60 and it didn't work. The GRUB loader would abort with the message:\ndrm_kms_helper: panic occured...\n\nI wasn't able to find any direct help regarding this so I thought I would post my question here.\n\nA: If you want 14.04: BIOS -> WLAN -> Disable. This way you'll be able to boot and install Ubuntu. \nAfter that, make sure to install all the available updates because newer kernels got added support to the wireless chip on board. \nYou don't need anything else to do: just install updates, and re-enable WLAN in BIOS. It will work.\n\nA: I just installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 on an Asus VivoPC VM60 by temporarily disabling the Wireless Network setting in the BIOS. This stops the Grub Loader from aborting during installation. After the installation is complete, go back into the BIOS and turn the Wireless Network setting back ON. The wireless adapter will automatically be recognized and installed during the next boot up.\nTo enter BIOS, press the F2 or Del keys during power up. \nIn the BIOS, choose the ADVANCED screen and select Onboard Devices Configuration. Then select WLAN Controller and change the setting from Enable to Disable. To save the changes and exit, press F10.\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu 12.10 LTS worked!

I am trying to record my podcast, which I do using Google Hangouts & Audacity.\nI recently switched from Windows 8.1 to Ubuntu.

I'm sure I'm either overlooking something and/or still don't quite understand ALSA/Pulse Audio.\n\nA: It will be difficult with pulse or alsa (directly).\nBut you can use jack audio server (version 2 is better).\nWith jack you can route audio signals from sources (line in, mic, etc.) to sinks (speakers, recorders, streaming encoders), passing through filters (vu meters, equalizers, etc), using a sort of virtual cable.\nVirtual audio cables on Windows got the idea from JACK :D\nThe tricky part is that you have to configure jack on your main sound card and hope the sound card allows you to use mic AND line-in at the same time (it's a hardware feature).\n", "Q: How to remove 'Sublime Text 3' from Ubuntu 14.04; installed with the instructions on http://www.sublimetext.com/3? There is a question for How to remove Sublime from Ubuntu 12.04. But I'm a bit too scared to run the commands since it only says 'Sublime' and the 12.04 version of Ubuntu is specified. \nI just installed 'Sublime Text 3' by clicking on the ubuntu 64 bit and then install from 'ubuntu software center'. \nI want to uninstall it but now I can't find it in my 'ubuntu software center'. I don't think it is in my history (based on the time stamps) but does anyone know what 'Sublime text 3' is called in this list (just in case)?\nOn this page it says to type this into the command line: \nsudo rm -r /opt/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2\nsudo rm /usr/bin/sublime\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/sublime.desktop\nsudo sed -i 's/sublime\\.desktop/gedit.desktop/g' /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\nOn this page it says to install synaptic and from there install and remove packages. Or to to delete it with:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge <package-name>\n\nOn this it says that if I installed it through 'ubuntu software center' or through running:\nsudo dpkg -i sublime-text_build-3047_amd64.deb\n\nThen I should remove it by running:\nsudo dpkg -r sublime-text \n\nWhich method should I use to make sure it is completely deleted from ubuntu 14.04? (The first instructions make me a bit scared that it is installed all over the place.)\n\nA: sudo apt-get remove sublime-text-installer\n\nThis command will completely remove the utility program from ubuntu. My recommendation is to this command.\n\nA: All methods, except for the first one, will effectively remove Sublime, granted you provide the correct package name.\nWhen you installed Sublime, you downloaded a Debian Package, which the Software Center proceeded to install. Software Center tends to be very poor handling these packages, so I recommend you not using it to find your installed package, instead use dpkg and grep to find the package name:\ndpkg -l \\*sublime\\*\n\nIt will show you any package with the name \"sublime\", then you can use any of the methods you listed to remove it.\nThe first will remove a manually compiled/installed Sublime, which didn't use the APT/DPKG system, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you actually employed this method.\n\nA: *\n\n*Search for Software Center in the Dash.  \n\n\n*In the Software Center search for sublime, then click on \"Sublime Text\".  \n\n\n*Click on \"Remove\" then enter your password and click \"Authenticate\". \n\n\nA: How did you install it?\n\n\n*\n\n*If you installed it from a package (downloading a .deb, adding a PPA and using apt-get install ..., or searching the Software Centre) then the approaches using apt-get remove, dpkg -r, Synaptic or the Software Centre will all do the same thing.\n\n*If you downloaded an archive, extracted it somewhere and then manually created launchers, use the command line approach  that has you delete those things.\nIf you did something else then you need to ignore all the given advice and work out the opposite of your taken approach.\nFWIW, what you're describing sounds like you just need to run:\nsudo apt-get remove sublime-text\n\n\nA: First of all install Synaptic package manager using:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nThen, choose mark for removal for sublime-text installer and then, remove it.\n\nA: I think, officially, there are two ways to install sublime. One is thorough the Ubuntu software center and the other is downloading the package from the website itself. If you're not sure which one you've used, first run this command:\nsudo snap list\n\nIf there is a sublime-text entry there, you can be sure that you've used the software center. it's worth to mention that it is also possible to install sublime using sudo snap install sublime-text. Using this command to install sublime will also add an entry in the snap list. You can use command:\nsudo snap remove sublime-text\n\nto remove sublime-text from your computer.\nIf you've installed it directly from the website by issuing wget command (if I'm not mistaken sublime website uses wget to download the package) then you have to use:\nsudo apt-get remove sublime-text\n\nto remove sublime.\nI had a funny issue myself. I had used both methods to install sublime so there were two sublimes available for me which was very annoying. I used both commands mentioned above and successfully removed sublime completely. If there are other ways of installing sublime (which I'm not aware of) I think the purge command sudo apt-get remove --purge <package-name> as you and friends mentioned above is the most reliable one. using rm command will manually delete sublime's files and folders which is like using shift + delete to remove it's folders. although that might be a working solution, but there is a chance that some configuration files (equivalent of 'registry' entries in Windows) of sublime might remain in the system and that might cause some problems (I think that one of the issues can be like the system won't notice the deletion of sublime and might try to open some files by sublime if sublime was the default app for some formats, but it's not there anymore.), and hence, reinstalling sublime might be a big problem.  So, I recommend remove using snap or apt.\nIt might also be worthy to mention: I recommend even installing the app using terminal:\nsudo snap install sublime-text\n\nthis way you can monitor the progress with much more specific details and hence won't encounter a corrupt installation and as a result a buggy sublime.\n", "Q: FTP to my Ubuntu machine kills my network I'm having a problem transferring files between my Ubuntu server and other machines with FTP.\nBasically, if I initiate an FTP request from my Ubuntu to my Mac, it works fine. But if I make a request from my Mac to my ubuntu machine, the entire LAN crashes, and I have to reboot the router to fix it. I have experimented with what triggers this. FTP from my Ubuntu to other machines works. FTP from my Mac to other machines works. But any FTP request to my Ubuntu from any machine crashes the network. \nTo sum it up, if my Ubuntu receives an FTP request, my network dies, but it can initiate them just fine. \nEven more, if I make a git pull request from my Ubuntu repo, the network crashes. But Ubuntu can push/pull just fine to/from my Mac. I've already been told this is likely a router issue, and I'm fine with accepting that. However, it's just odd that the issue surrounds my Ubuntu, and only when receiving FTP connections. so I'm asking if there is something that could be wrong with the machine, instead of the router.\nI have even upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04.1 to see if there was some outdated package, but the problem persists.\nI'm completely at a loss with what detail specs to offer, so if any other info is need, let me know.\nI am using a Linksys E2500 router. It's about a year old, and I've never had issues with these routers before.\nUPDATE:\nAfter some more tinkering, I realized that FTP works fine. SFTP is what is crashing my network. I have openssh-server installed already, so I'm wondering if there is some other package that needs to be setup to allow the Ubuntu server to receive SFTP connections.\nSince this problem appears not to match the original stated, I made a new thread:\nSFTP to local ubuntu server crashes network\n\nA: There is nothing wrong with your network, it's not a bug, it's a feature of TCP/IP: let's use full available bandwith, and it saturates your network easily (router gets too busy).\nYou need to embrace Quality of service (QoS), read about it and configure it. There should be related options in your router. Take a look at page 28 in the Linksys E2500 user manual.\nAnyway, this approach might not solve your problem because QoS rules may be applied in traffic being routed between LAN and WAN but not on traffic being switched over LAN.\nMy recommended approach is to limit FTP bandwidth.\nIf your [S]FTP client has bandwith limit option, use it. Here is a screenshot of WinSCP taken from the internet:\n\nYou can see the option on the bottom right corner.\nIf your client does not have such option, limit server bandwidth. I have not done that myself so I can't guide you step by step, but I can point you to a configure FTP bandwidth limit tutorial.\nPlease keep in mind that if you are using SCP, SFTP or any SSH-related transfer, your port will be 22 instead of 21, so you'll need to tweak your configuration accordingly.\n\nA: OK, I could tell you to try another git protocol, but this would be only a workaround.\nIf I were in your place, I would connect the Mac and the Ubuntu through a vanilla Ethernet hub and see what happens with a sniffer program like wireshark. Maybe your Ubuntu box emits strange Ethernet packets in some situations, maybe your route between the wireless network and the wired fails in some situations. Doing this, I would be able to state where the problem is: router or Ubuntu box.\nI hope this helps, but unfortunately, I think I can't go further.\n", "Q: Binding keys to buttons on a Ps3 gamepad controller I have both a dual shock 3 and a knock off wired ps3 controller.

I`m using Ubuntu 12.04 and I need to power on my computer by creating a task just like wake up my phone by setting alarm in Nokia phones,Can i do this in Linux Systems?  \n\nA: After shutdown, your computer is off. So nothing can happen with it, unless you press the power button manually.\nOf course, they may be some alternative like Wake-on-LAN capabilities if supported by your BIOS. This is a mechanism by which specific packets are sent to a powered off computer (but of course still connected to a power source and an Ethernet network) to power it on.\nObviously, this has to be done from a source external to your computer.\nUnfortunately, not all BIOS and network adapters support Wake-on-LAN\nMore info about Wake-on-LAN at Wikipedia.\n\nA: From any device with internet access you can wake-up your machine from internet or LAN (if enabled in BIOS and forwarded properly trough a router, if any) by means of magic packet.

Do not edit directly with an editor! vipw locks the file, so that other commands won't try to update it at the same time.

So That is why I automatically start one of the remaining 4 VM. \nAs the remaining VMs will be harmed by time, I wonder how could I generate  a bash script on the host machine that will allow me to automatically clone a safe VM ?\n\nA: To just clone the VM vm1 (where vm1 is the name of the VM) to vm2, something like this will do:\nvboxmanage clonevm vm1 --name vm2\n\nFor more information, run vboxmanage --help - clonevm  can take varying options:\n  clonevm                   <uuid|vmname>\n                            [--snapshot <uuid>|<name>]\n                            [--mode machine|machineandchildren|all]\n                            [--options link|keepallmacs|keepnatmacs|\n                                       keepdisknames]\n                            [--name <name>]\n                            [--groups <group>, ...]\n                            [--basefolder <basefolder>]\n                            [--uuid <uuid>]\n                            [--register]\n\nThis could be done automatically in a script (e.g. checking mod/access times, assigned name based on date, gvfs variable, etc)\n", "Q: Move directory to Grandpa directory and delete the parent directory Sometimes, we note that we have unused nested containers (directories) . \nFor example :\nmkdir -p ~/grandpa/pa;\n\nAnd pa directory is the only file existed on grandpa. \nHence, all files of pa should be moved to grandpa, then pa will be deleted.\nMy question is there is a built-in command line do such a mission: \ni.e: \norphan  ~/grandpa/pa/*\n\nor \nfatherless ~/grandpa/pa/*\n\n\nA: You can just use standard bash commands - mv, rm, etc - for example\nmv ~/grandpa/pa/* ~/grandpa/ && rmdir ~/grandpa/pa/\n\nThis:\n\n\n*\n\n*uses mv to move the files in ~/grandpa/pa/* to ~/grandpa/\n\n*uses && so the rmdir command only if the mv exits successfully - ; could be used..\n\n*uses rmdir to remove the pa directory if it is empty.\n\n\nN.B. tested on the directory structure - before:\n$ tree ~/grandpa/\n./grandpa/\n|-- anotherfile.txt\n`-- pa\n    |-- child\n    |   `-- file3.txt\n    |-- file1.txt\n    `-- file2.txt\n\n2 directories, 4 files\n\nafter:\n$ tree ~/grandpa/\n./grandpa/\n|-- anotherfile.txt\n|-- child\n|   `-- file3.txt\n|-- file1.txt\n`-- file2.txt\n\n1 directory, 4 files\n\n", "Q: Want to detect Android x86 in Ubuntu GRUB menu I was using Ubuntu and Windows 8.1 in my Lenovo G560 laptop.\nLater I installed android x86 4.4.2 (KitKat) but the problem is GRUB is not detecting android x86 in GRUB menu.\nI had also done the sudo grub-update in the terminal of Ubuntu, and still only Ubuntu and windows are only listed.\nMoreover I also tried boot-repair, same result came.If there is some advance settings in boot-repair than I don't know.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open 40_custom : sudo gedit /etc/burg.d/40_custom\n\n*Add Android x86 menu entry : menuentry \"Android-4.3-x86\" --class android {\nset root='(hd*,msdos*)'\nlinux /path/android-4.3-x86/kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 androidboot.hardware=tx2500 acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode SRC=/path/android-4.3-x86 vga=788\ninitrd /path/android-4.3-x86/initrd.img ('path' and '*' as yours)\n\n*Update grub : sudo update-grub\n\n*Restart\n\n", "Q: Which server version (64-bit) of Ubuntu will be suitable (for Gazebo and Ros Simulation)? I  am using Dell Precision T7500 Chassis (Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5606 2.13GHz, 8M cache, 4.8 GT/s QPI, Turbo, HT, 4C,NVIDIA Tesla C2050 Graphic Card,1GB NVIDIA Quadro 600,Dual Monitor,1DP & 1DVI) as server. If any one has work experience or idea in this plz let me know, which server version of Ubuntu will be best suitable.\n\nA: Since the CPU does support 64-bit architecture and you have 8GB of RAM, I'd recommend using the 64-bit Version of Ubuntu. Usually you need a minimum of about 4GB RAM for 64-bit, but 8 should be more than enough.\n", "Q: Cannot remove Nexus 5 Network from network list When I click on the Network Manager indicator I have an odd entry in there called Nexus 5 network\n\nClicking on it does nothing and it does not show up in the list of networks in Edit Connections\n\nThe university I'm studying at suggests that this is causing some of the connection troubles that I'm having. Can anyone suggest why this is appearing and how I can have it safely removed? I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Dell XPS 13 laptop.\n\nA: Is your Nexus 5 plugged in with tethering turned on? Ubuntu is seeing it as another network device. There are two obvious remedies here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug it\n\n*Turn off tethering\n\n\nBut it's probably not responsible for your wider networking issues.\n", "Q: Installing node with apt-get or downloading the Linux Binaries (.tar.gz) What is the difference between installing node.js with 'sudo apt-get install nodejs' or downloading the Linux Binaries (.tar.gz) and following these instructions?\nIs the outcome the same?\n\nA: Installing from source has one pitfall, that removing (and otherwise keeping track of installed files) becomes difficult. It's best to let the package manager handle the installation. You can use this PPA and then apt-get will get you the latest version.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\n\nThe PPA has since been moved to another source. The instructions from the NodeJS Github wiki:\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nThe commands, condensed out from the script:\nsudo apt-get install apt-transport-https lsb-release curl \ncurl -s https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource.gpg.key | apt-key add -\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node $(lsb_release -sc) main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list\"\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'deb-src https://deb.nodesource.com/node $(lsb_release -sc) main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\n\nA: There are a few differences\n\n\n*\n\n*The version available for Ubuntu is made for Ubuntu, and will include/depend on any extra packages needed, and may have specific configuration for Ubuntu\n\n*The version for Ubuntu can just be installed using apt - the tar.gz from the nodejs will need to be configured.\n\n*The version from the nodejs site will be more up-to-date (currently v0.10.30 on their site compared to v0.10.25 from the Ubuntu repos)\nNote you can use a PPA to get a more up-to-date version - e.g. this one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Unity got slow during the last couple of updates I've been using Ubuntu since 12.04 and have not really experienced any issues until a couple of weeks ago when my PC got really slow and all software as well. Switching workspaces is more of a lagfest than a smooth animation.\nI don't think its a hardware issue since the specs are pretty high-end except for the graphics card.\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD FX-8320 8 Core\n\n*Nvidia GTX630\n\n*16GB DDR3 Ram (1600)\n\n\nRunning;\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 amd64\n\n*Nvidia proprietary drivers 331.38 (Have also tested noeveau driver but no cigar)\n\n\nEven typing is slow, I can sometimes type 3 words before they appear in this text-box on askubuntu. I tried switching to Gnome but that made things even worse, so I switched back to unity.\nI have no clue as to where one would start looking for issues, so I turn to you guys for tips.\nEdit So it seems that switching to a lightweight DE fixes some of the issues but seriously, shouldn't my specs be able to handle Unity or Gnome? I have another equal workstation but running Windows 7 Ultimate instead, and I have never experienced anything that even resembles lag on that PC - even with 4 android emulators running simultaneously.\nI'll switch to a lighter DE if needed but I'm having a real hard time thinking that the developers expect the public to have much better PC's than my specs when running Ubuntu - I'm thinking my specs is a bit overkill even cut in half (except for the graphics). Plus I like having a modern look and feel, which none of the lighter DE provides (everything looks like it was made in the 1980's).\nEdit I changed the IOMMU bios setting and reinstalled Ubuntu without any proprietary drivers and now everything seems to be working at last. \n\nA: So it seems that the IOMMU bios setting is a real issue for many with Gigabyte mainboards. After having toggled this setting and re-installed Ubuntu it all runs smoothly and nice again.\nAlso, having toggled the bios setting Ubuntu now finds compatible drivers for my hardware, earlier I had to manually setup realtek chipset and graphics drivers.\n", "Q: Beautiful Soup 4 not working with Python 3.4.0 I am using Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit Operating System . \nI installed Beautiful Soup 4 using this command :\nsudo apt-get install python-bs4\n\nWith Python 2.7.6 , I had no difficulty importing the bs4 module.\nBut when I used Python 3.4.0 it showed me this error.\n>>>import bs4\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named 'bs4'\n\nI also tried to install it using pip.\nsudo pip install beautifulsoup4\n\nBut again it didn't worked with Python 3.4.0.\nRight now I have uninstalled pip and also uninstalled Beautiful Soup 4 \nsudo apt-get remove python-bs4\nsudo apt-get remove python-pip\n\nWhat should I do next to properly install Beautiful Soup 4 for both  Python 2.7.6 and Python 3.4.0 ??\n\nA: In all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install python3-bs4\n\npython3-bs4 is an error-tolerant HTML parser for Python 3. You can see from this that there are two different packages: python-bs4 (for Python 2.x) and python3-bs4 (for Python 3.x), and to prevent you from getting confused there are also two different Integrated Development Environments for Python: IDLE and IDLE 3 to run them in.\n", "Q: Trouble using cd command with \"~\" or \"$HOME\" in bash scripting We know that ~ and $HOME refer to the home directory of the current user. (For me echo ~=echo $HOME=pandya).\nBut I can't use it in bash scripting.  Here is a simple example script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho -n \"Enter Directory Path:\"\nread dir1\ncd $dir1\n\nBut When executed, it gives error No such file or directory as follows:\n$ ./script\nEnter Directory Path:~/Desktop\n./script: line 4: cd: ~/Desktop: No such file or directory\n\nIf /home/pandya used instead of ~ ,then it is working.\nSame problem with $HOME.\nThus, How to properly use cd with ~ or $HOME in such bash scripting?\n\nA: You can solve this problem by using eval command :\n#!/bin/bash\necho -n \"Enter Directory Path:\"\nread dir1\neval cd \"$dir1\"\n\nBecause in your code $dir1 will not store ~/Desktop but it will store /home/user/Desktop so you can use eval command .\nTo understand Eval command Here\n\nA: Here's an example which works.\nAs said before, the expansion of variables from input is the key.\n#!/bin/bash\necho -n \"Dir:\"\nread dir1\ndir2=`eval echo $dir1`\ncd $dir2\npwd\n\nOf course, you should not expect that your current shell will change its working directory after script execution. It will remain unaffected.\n\nA: The problem is the tilde expansion happens before variable expansion (see man bash for details). Variable expansion happens just once, so $dir1 is expanded, but the string $HOME inside it is not.\nIt might be easier to specify the directory path as a command line argument instead of using read to read it from the console: the shell will expand it for you:\n#!/bin/bash\ndir1=$1\ncd \"$dir1\"\npwd\n\nand call it like\n./script ~/Desktop\n\nAnother alternative is to use a file dialog instead of typing the path at all:\ndialog --dselect / 20 20\n\n"]
