["Q: How to accept only essential security updates? sometimes i am getting problem in software updates. So i would like to get only essential security updates and also need to make it as default. Please let me know is there any way to sort out that?\n\nA: All security updates are essential. Otherwise they would not be \"security\"updates.\nSee software&updates for the options you have:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The top checkbox is about \"important security updates\" so keep that one active. If that is all you need uncheck the other 3. \n\n*The 1st 2 dropdown boxes let you set when these are checked and what is done when there is an update (display, download or download+install). \n", "Q: How to merge images in a single PDF or image file I have some images which I want to merge. By this I mean that if I have 5 images, I want to arrange them in this way:\n\nI want to do this using a command so that I can use a Bash script for it. For example the command could be like this:\nfoo image1 image2 image3 image4 image5\n\nI have lots of images so the command should be able to process a large number of files.\nThe output can be PDF or even in image format.\n\nA: I was doing something similar the other day. Grids are in, it seems. In my case I had a variable number of images being piped into the grid and I just wanted to create a 17 wide image by however many images tall.\nmontage -mode concatenate $(printf 'rose: %.0s' {1..136}) -resize 100x80 -tile 17x output.jpg\n\nThat just uses 136 rose images to form a 8-tile-high grid. Obviously you'll want to change the $(...) group for a list of your input images. And you'll want to set the tile variable to something like 2x if you just want to set the number of tiles.\nIn terms of outputting to PDF, you can just change the extension. So you would be looking at something like:\nmontage -mode concatenate $(printf 'rose: %.0s' {1..5}) -tile 2x out.pdf\n\n\nA: See the montage command from imagemagick (sudo apt-get install imagemagick).\nmontage -geometry 250x250+0+0 image1.png image2.png out.png\n\nThis will resize each image (to 250px with no deformation) and combine them with no margin. \nMore montage examples.\n\nYou can also use convert (example with wildcards): \nconvert -append pixpixp-*.jpg newpix.jpg\n\n", "Q: Block a command I don't want any admin users in my system to execute the following command other than root.\n\"sudo cp /etc/sudoers \"\nIs it possible to block it for admin users only?\nI have tried lot but didn't get anything?\n\nA: If you don't trust someone to have full shell access on your system, don't give them shell access at all. \nYou want to stop cp command what about other commands that acts like cp , what about if admins use scp command . \nAm not saying its impossible to block this command , but a play around trick will defeat your goal .\n", "Q: How do I list all currently installed \"winetricks\"?

That won't work. The remote shell session has no concept of your local filesystem.\nYou need to push the file from something running in Windows. WinSCP is a good client.

You will need to edit /etc/fstab for that, and make sure the external disk is connected whenever grive starts up.\nYou can mount your external drive to ~/Google Drive using the following commands:\nmkdir -p ~/Google\\ Drive\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\nsudo sed -i.bak '/6A5AA8035AA7CA61/d' /etc/fstab\nsudo tee -a /etc/fstab <<EOF\nUUID=6A5AA8035AA7CA61 $HOME/Google\\040Drive ntfs-3g rw,exec,uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -u),umask=0022\nEOF\nsudo mount ~/Google\\ Drive\n\nThis will mount your external disk on ~/Google Drive with correct permissions.\n", "Q: Ubuntu wont show in Windows bootloader I have installed ubuntu 14.04.

I'm looking to be able to full screen apps and move back and forth between them. I would want to start with one virtual desktop and then I could create more on demand. I know I can specify more virtual desktops but I would like to find a on demand approach.\n\nA: Gnome Shell does all that. It always has exactly one empty workspace (so if you add a window to it, a new empty workspace is created). Note that this is the default - you can configure a static workspace listing via gnome-tweak-tool. I am able to drag full screen windows around in the Overview mode - this helps me start games in one workspace and drag them elsewhere.\n", "Q: ubuntu Installation does Not detect second hard drive I Have 2 sata Hard drives \n1 TB and a 500 GB\ni created another partition on 500gb hard drive but in ubuntu installation i cant see the partition i made only the hard drive and detects it like this :\nsize: 467Gb Free space : unknown\n\n\nA: You've formatted the second drive as Dynamic - the NTFS-3G module in Ubuntu will not read these correctly.\nReformat the drive as basic and it should pick up. Note that you will lose all data on the drive doing it. You can convert from basic to dynamic without data loss, but not the other way around.\nAlso, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble by formatting the volumes as FAT.

I downloaded a software package in a .tar.bz file.\nI understand that I can install such packages through make install, but then there's no easy way to uninstall. Is there a way that I can add this package to my local repository, so that I can install/uninstall it through apt-get?\n\nA: *\n\n*Some tar.bz files don't actually need \"make install\". They are already compiled for your version of Ubuntu.  To delete these, just delete the folder that you extracted them into. e.g. fritzing-0.9.0b.linux.AMD64.tar_1.bz2\n\n*If you use \"make install\" you can just delete the folders that it creates\n\n*If you use \"sudo make install\" files can be placed all over your system, so you'll have to look in the make file and see what it did and remove everything. A lot more complicated!\n\n", "Q: Correct way of RAID partitioning This is a more theoretical question I ran into after I found out that it is possible with newer Kernels to create partitions on a RAID-volume.\nSince Grub2 it is possible to have /boot on a RAID-volume. My basic setup for small servers always looked like this since then:\n\n\n*\n\n*md0 --> ext3/4 --> /swap \n\n*md1 --> ext3/4 --> /boot \n\n*md2 --> ext3/4 --> /\n\n*md3 --> ext3/4 --> /home\n\n\nNever ran into problems with this. However, it is possible (I don't know since when exactly) to create one RAID-Volume and create multiple partitions on that volume (meaning no LVM but \"native\" partitions like md0p1 etc.).\nSo I'm just wondering what's the sense behind this? Are there any performance-related pros to go that way or is this just an organizational \"feature\"? I seldom experienced Kernel developers to include a feature that doesn't provide an improvement compared to former versions so can anybody explain which environment would profit from such a setup?\n\nA: The ability to create partitions from a volume applies to RAID and any device exposed to the OS like a single SATA/IDE HDD, they are all just block storage volumes to the OS.\n2 potential advantages, you essentially move the configuration of your storage from a hardware level to an OS level and you would less reliant on your RAID controller manufacturers tools for configuration and diagnostics/repair.\nYou will loose flexibility/scalability compared to using multiple raid volumes (such as using a mixed RAID 10 / RAID5 setup, more flexibility with where hot/cold spares are assigned to (so your OS volume may only have minimal spares, but your data volumes multiple spares).\n", "Q: Google Books downloader for Ubuntu I want to download free Google books in pdf format.\nIs there any Google Books downloading tool available for Ubuntu?\n\nA: Thanks to @Glutanimate for his comment to the OP.\ngetxbook makes a good case for why it is the best option available.  I just installed it and used it to download this book with success.\ngetxbook comes with installation instructions (in the INSTALL file).  Once installed, it is run as follows:\n$ getxbookgui\n\nAlternatively, the command\n$ getgbook book-id\n\ncan be used.  (The book ID is in the URL for the book.  For example, the ID for the book I downloaded is 3pK1-LxtFV4C.)\nIf only a subset of pages is desired, use\n$ getgbook -n book-id\n\nAnd then enter the pages you want, one at a time, e.g.:\n$ getgbook -n book-id\n262\n\nWhen I said the book was downloaded with success, I wasn't being totally honest.  For some reason, getxbook missed a few pages that were available in the preview.  To get these, I followed these instructions.\nNote that the book is downloaded to a sub-directory of the current directory named with the book ID.  It is downloaded as a set of .png and/or .jpg files, one per page.  These can be converted to .pdf format as follows (after converting the .jpg files to .png files one by one):\n$ convert *.png book.pdf\n\nNote that if you intend to print this .pdf on paper, you may need to resize some of the individual images (so that they're all roughly the same size) before converting to the .pdf.  I used gimp to do this.\n\nA: There is a Python program called PySheng than did the job for me.\nIt's available on Github at https://github.com/tokland/pysheng\nYou can run the following commands to install it.\ngit clone https://github.com/tokland/pysheng\ncd pysheng\nsudo python setup.py install\n\nNow PySheng will be available from the Termainl.\nYou can run pysheng-gui and pysheng from the terminal for the GUI and terminal version respectively.\npysheng-gui\n\n\n", "Q: upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04.1 After upgrading (12.08.2014) from version 12.04 to 14.04.1 \nI get an notification:\nSystem program problem detected.

(moreover, I chose whole system encryption)\nHowever, after the default install I ended up with only 2 logical volumes (swap and root) and am unable to take snapshots. The first question therefore is:\nQ1: What is the point of such default LVM setup in Ubuntu?\nWhile the inability to take snapshots is probably easy to solve, it seems to me it would not be of much use unless I create another logical volumes (e.g. one for /home) as I don't want the snapshot to include files in /home folder. The second question then is:\nQ2: What is the good way of creating another logical volume, assigning it a mount point and moving files into it?\nNote #1: My user's home is encrypted as well.\nNote #2: While I did find several tutorials regarding use of LVM, this topic is not covered in any of them.\n\nA: STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOUR RESULTS MAY VARY. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS YOU MAY INCUR. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BACKUPS OF ANY CRITICAL DATA BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS PROCEDURE.\nQ.1: You will need to leave some free space in your VG if you plan on snapshotting.\nQ.2: You can create a new LV to use for /home in the same VG. If you already allocated the entire disk to the root LV, you will need to resize it first to generate unallocated space for your new /home LV (and space for snapshots if you plan on using that capability). You can do this from a live USB flash drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once booted from the live USB medium, you will need to manually\nunlock the LUKS container to access the LVs. (See man cryptsetup.)\n\n*After you resize the root LV (See man lvreduce.) and create your \nnew /home LV (See man lvcreate.), format your new /home LV and\nthen mount the two LVs at a temporary location in your live\nfilesystem (such as /mnt/root & /mnt/home).\n\n*You can then mirror your original /home filesystem to the new\n/home LV using rsync (from /mnt/root/home to /mnt/home).\n\n*Update the fstab on the root LV to mount the new LV at /home. Remove\nthe contents of the original /home folder (*sudo rm -rf\n/mnt/root/home/**), making sure to leave the empty folder as the mount\npoint for your new /home LV.\n\n*You should then be able to reboot from the live USB into your\ninstalled system which will now have separate root and /home LVs.\n\n\nFurther reading: How can I resize an LVM partition?

That file is located in /dev/ and the process by witch you access it is called mounting\nSo you plug in the camera, the system detects it and it creates that file in /dev/ that you need to mount in order to access. Ubuntu usually auto-mounts the devices for you, and that is probably what you are experiencing there. The usual mount point for devices is in /media/ or /mnt/ depending on the linux distribution (for ubuntu it's /media/).\nYou can manually mount and unmount devices using the terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and executing the mount and umount commands which you can use the --help attributes on, read their manual pages using man mount and man umount or google about them. \nYou should read a little about the linux file system in order to understand how it does all this and how handy it becomes when you need to expand a folder size or create logical volumes.\n", "Q: Does upgrading window 8 to window 8.1 will affect Ubuntu i have a window 8.1 update to my laptop.But am afraid that after updating window 8 it will affect the grub menu and i wont able to boot into Ubuntu..is it safe to upgrade to window 8.1 ??\n\nA: It will overwrite the grub bootloader as you fear, but with a livecd you can run a sudo update-grub command on the disk and it will resolve it\n", "Q: What could \"reject due to mismatch with WPA/WPA2\" in output of wpa_supplicant mean?

I also found tutorials but they only showed running one single script under multiple tabs, not multiple scripts under multiple tabs. Also I think it would be nice if the name of the tabs was changed to the name of the scripts as well so that I can tell which script is which. The reason for this is because I'm running a Gaming server and I don't like opening multiple windows and I want everything to be neat and in one place.\n\nA: Try this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd \"/Server/Gen2\"\n\noptions=()\ntab=\"\"\nfor file in *; do\n    [[ -d $file ]] && continue # not a file\n    [[ ! -x \"$file\" ]] && continue # not executable\n    options+=($tab --title=\"$file\"  -e \"bash -ic \\\"nice -n 3 ./$file ; bash\\\"\" ) \n    tab=\"--tab\"\ndone\n\nxfce4-terminal \"${options[@]}\"\n\nTo allow renaming the title, follow this https://askubuntu.com/a/22417\n", "Q: Cannot move swap space This has been asked here, Why I'm seeing a lock besides the partition I'm trying to modify with gparted?, but I'm having problems.\nThese two partitions both have ext4 as their file system. They are both unmounted. Swap space is swapped off:\nI want to extend sda1 with sda3. I have no data on sda3\nHowever, when I click resize/move on sda1 I get this:\n\nIt's as big as it can go!\nIt's the same story if sda3 is empty unallocated space:\n\nsda1 is as big as it can be. How do I extend it into the unallocated space?\nWorth mentioning that the screen shots are from a liveCD containing GParted's iso.\nI gather I need to move unallocated space next to the drive that needs to be extended. I cannot click and drag sda2 containing swap space an inch. \nThis liveCD shouldn't be using it but it's the best answer I've had:\n\nI can extend the swap space no problem. What does this mean?\n\n\nA: Step 0: Backup your data\nMake sure you have up to date and good backup of all your personal files. The backup must be outside your computer. If you haven't backed up your data, stop now and make backup.\nStep 1: Boot from a LiveCD/DVD/USB\nYou have done this. I am writing it for anyone who may read this later. This is important, as you can't change a tire of a car while you are driving it.\nStep 2: Disable Swap\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, or click on the Terminal icon of live CD desktop\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nStep 3: Delete Swap partition\nMake sure the swap partition is unmounted. Right click on the Swap partition from within Gparted, and click on Unmount.\nNow you should be able to delete swap partition. It is the logical partition /dev/sda5 inside the extended partition /dev/sda2.\nStep 4: Delete Extended Partition /dev/sda2\nThe extended partition can't be deleted until the logical partition inside it is deleted. We did that in step 3. Now we can delete /dev/sda2.\nStep 5: Delete /dev/sda3\nYou can delete this partition as it has no data. Then you will use most of this space to resize the /dev/sda1.\nStep 6: Resize sda1\nUse Gparted to expand /dev/sda1. Leave 8GB space (or less if you want) at the end to recreate the swap partition.\n#Step 7: Create a new swap partition\nYou can choose to create a primary partition (new /dev/sda2) for swap. Since you are going to have only two partitions in this drive, there is no need for an extended partition.\nStep 8: Find the new UUID of the two partitions\nEither\nIn Gparted: Right click on a partition and select \"Information\"\nOr\nIn terminal enter:\nsudo blkid\n\nAnd write down (or copy to a text editor) the two UUIDs for sda1 (/ partition) and sda2 (swap).\nStep 9: Edit /etc/fstab\nMount the main partition, i.e.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/mount_sda1\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/mount_sda1\n\nand navigate to /mnt/mount_sda1/etc/  folder.\nFind the file called fstab. Copy the new UUID in their appropriate places if needed.\nIf there is any lines related to the old /dev/sda3, you should delete that. As that partition does not exist any more.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I was able to do this in my VM like this:\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the swap partition in between and select Swapoff\n\n\n\n*Right click on it again and select \"Resize/Move\"\n\n\n*Drag that swap partition all the way to the right and click Resize/Move.\n\n\n\n*Right Click on the full partition and select \"Resize/Move\"\n\n\n*Now you will be able to resize it and make use of the unallocated space\n\n\n\n*Click \"Resize\" and \"Apply Changes\" (✓ button).\n\nA: An addition to above answer, if your distro uses initramfs , you need to change swap partition UUID there too.\nChange this line in the file /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume\nRESUME=UUID=b007b23d-e1b5-40de-a8fb-dc2d89f83347\n\nand then run\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\n", "Q: Upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04.1, can't access some websites (403 forbidden) I upgraded my server to 14.04.1. After I restarted Apache, I discovered that some of my sites are not accessible (403 forbidden). The common denominator is that they are my Drupal sites and a group of Wordpress (multisite) sites. A pair of other WP (multisite) sites in a separate directory are working.\nIf I type the base URL as an IP address, e.g., 66.210.xxx.xx, in my browser, I get a DB error: I cannot connect to the database because: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)\nIt's a LAMP VM, hosted remotely, so I only have SSH access. I did turn off root access with password over SSH when I did the package upgrade; don't know if that's related. I don't login as root, so I didn't think I needed it.\nThe other noteworthy thing is that before I could start Apache, I had to edit my v-hosts.conf files, because they had this:\n<Directory \"/path/to/site\">\n    allow from all\n    Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride All\n</Directory>\n\nI had to change the Options to:\nOptions -Indexes +FollowSymLinks\n\nIn order to restart Apache.\n\nA: After checking the logs, looking at directory permissions, making sure various DMS db configs hadn't changed, etc, I looked at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, which apparently I had allowed to be overwritten during the upgrade. The <Directory> sections are more restrictive than what I had, since I have different CMSs in non-standard locations, NOT /var/www/. Those were the sites that wouldn't let me in. Adding in directives for them (and using the new \"Require all granted\" syntax) & restarting Apache solved it.\n", "Q: Wireless Connection not working I just installed Ubuntu 14.04-1 on an HP Pavilion V-4000 laptop.  The wireless does not work and doesn't show any wireless networks.  There is a switch to turn on wireless, but now it doesn't work. It worked just fine when running windows XP.

We have:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"settings\" dialogs for keyboard and mouse\n\n*The ccsm tool with chainsaw-like ability to shred your system\n\n*Unity tweaks (another obscure application)\n\n*gconf-editor\n\n*Kernel configuration to access consoles through Ctrl-Alt-Fx\n\n*I don't know what else.\n\n\nRecently, I tried to re-assign Super-L to lower a window rather than lock the screen for my 14.04 setup.  We already have Ctrl-Alt-L to lower the screen anyway, I don't need a second shortcut.  But after trying several tools to re-assign the key, I just gave up.  Several layers of assignment all implemented the \"same\" shortcut, but it isn't easy to figure out which one(s) are actually causing the system to respond as it is.  Without that information, it is hard to reconfigure.  \nThis is a crazy-making setup that makes Linux harder to use than Windows for the average user: Too many arcane ways to set things up, and then a tangle of confusion trying to figure out why anything happens as it does.  How I long for the good old days of fvwm, the simple window manager that could assign any key or mouse click combination to do anything in any context, and the entire configuration was in a single .fvwmrc file! Using Fvwm as the only holder of system-wide shortcuts make life simple, but the multi-layer approach makes Microsoft's regedit seem simple!\nIt would be wonderful if there were a simple script that could search all the system and user-specific files for a keyword, and report where keypress and mouse-click events matching a pattern are configured.  Ideally, it would support a \"universal\" keypress and mouse-click description syntax or a GUI, and parse and match that in each of the many configuration files.  A bonus would be if the script could print out a suggestion how to manage the setting with the least potential for inadvertent misconfiguration (for example, helping the user avoid using ccsm when it isn't needed).\n\nA: *\n\n*Fn× handled by BIOS/Firmware or driver.\nSome vendors provide a way to customize them with limited options.

If I wanted to move to the next input method, I used to press Alt+Left Shift. \nNow I have upgraded to 14.04. Here I see the option to move to the next and previous input method. However, I don't see any option to disable the input method completely and use the default (English) script. \nSo, If I have to switch from English to Kannada, I have to press Ctrl+Space, and then from Kannada to English, I have to either press Ctrl+Space twice, or Ctrl+Shift+Space\nIs there any way to just enable/disable the IBus input just like it was in 12.04?\n\nA: Go to Language Support and Locate Keyboard input Method System and change it from Ibus to None.\n\n", "Q: grub-install fails after upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04 (grub-pc is broken) I just upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04, but during the installation grub-install failed:\n\n\nI continued with the installation and hoped to fix the grub issue afterwards.

I think this inconsistency is the root of the problem.\nNow I wonder:\n\n\n*\n\n*What should the line grub-pc/install_devices in the output of debconf-show grub-pc be?\n\n*How can I change the Grub settings, so I can experiment with different values?\n\n\nI also just noticed that the installation of grub-pc is broken:\n$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n/usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: grub-pc is broken or not fully installed\n\n\nA: Here is how I fixed the problem:\nIn a quiet moment, I had time to risk downtime. So I rebooted the system with a Ubuntu 14.04 Live CD and reinstalled Grub. I did not encounter problems and afterwards, the system booted normally.\nHere is a general description: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#via_the_LiveCD_terminal\nFrom memory, here are the commands that I used in my specific case:\nBoot from Live CD and executed the following commands:\n $ sudo su\n $ mount /dev/mapper/isw_cjccfdbihf_Volume0p1 /mnt\n\n (Sorry, I'm not 100% sure whether the target was /dev/mapper/isw_cjccfdbihf_Volume0p1 or\n  /dev/sda. I think it was /dev/mapper/isw_cjccfdbihf_Volume0p1.)\n $ grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/mapper/isw_cjccfdbihf_Volume0p1\n $ reboot\n\nAfter that, the system rebooted. Finally, I could finish the broken installation with sudo apt-get install.\nAt the moment, /etc/fstab still lists /dev/mapper/isw_cjccfdbihf_Volume01 for the root directory. I still don't know if that is actually correct, but I haven't tried to change it to /dev/mapper/isw_cjccfdbihf_Volume0p1 to find out whether it still works after a reboot.\n\nA: Installing grub2 in a RAID-setup fails, because device naming is somehow changed with the update, but the runnig system not yet rebooted uses a different naming scheme.\nJust cancel grub-install when it failes and reboot. The formerly installed grub still points to a valid kernel and can boot without any problem. After rebooting, grub installs without any problems.\n\nA: Brilliant. I had to change only one thing to avoid this error when executing the grub-install command:\n/usr/bin/grub-bios-setup: warning: Embedding is not possible. GRUB\ncan only be installed in this setup by using blocklists. However,\nblocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..\n/usr/bin/grub-bios-setup: error: will not proceed with blocklists.\n\nUsing your commands above, I changed the grub-install command to install GRUB to the MBR instead of the partition like so (removing the 'p1'):\n$ grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/mapper/isw_cjccfdbihf_Volume0\n\nOtherwise, it really saved my behind and lots of grief. I'm very grateful.\n\nA: None of the answers worked for me so I rebooted and used the Boot Repair Disk to fix the problem. This worked.

You can upload previously uploaded packages, only if they are exactly the same, with the dput -f option. See this answer and this one on Launchpad.\nIf you delete a package from Launchpad, it is deleted according a procedure as described here. Launchpad still keeps a checksum however of the deleted files to prevent future (version-) conflicting uploads. \nThe bottom line is that you will have to upload under an increased version number. Not that it helps for now, but you can prevent errors by first try building locally.\n", "Q: Networking and sharing data I Have a tp_link TL-WR740N router  and two pc and laptop and then...\nHow Can I Do network two or four computer with one router and use internet and sharing data between ones?\nExcuse me for bad grammar's!\nThanks\n\nA: The easiest case is when they are all in the same network segment.\nAnd that is the case when they are all connected to the same router to the internet.\nHubs or switches somewhere in between are no problem.\nThe usual default setup is just right for the case - the router should run DHCP to tell all connected computers which common network address, and which IP addresses to use.\nUsing the router configuration, you can assign names to the computers, which will be associated with the MAC hardware address of the network interfaces.  \nThe router will assign IP addresses to the computers, but in case the IP addresses get changed later, the router can just map the name to the new IP address.  \nThat should be all you need!\n\nYour internet provider will normally change your IP address seen from the internet from time to time, because it makes thir life easier.\nTo easily reach your router from outside interenet anyway, use a dynamic DNS service, that will keep track of your IP address and let the iinternet know if someone asks.\n(They are usually free of charge or very cheap.)\nFrom the internet, you do not see the individual computers. There is just the router. But the router can be configured to forward connections to a certain port to a certain computer, which is called network address translation, NAT. So you can share the connections from outside too.  \nFor example, if Alice and Bob want to run a web server, the can run it on their port 80 both on their computers, and the router gets configured to foreard connections to port 80 to alicesbox:80, and connections to port 8080 to bobsbox:80.\n", "Q: Connecting to secure WebDAV makes Nautilus hang up I just received a box.com account from my school and, since Box Sync does not exist for Linux, I instead tried using the WebDAV service box.com offers.\nI tried the Nautilus:File->Connect to Server... way.

I am setting up a Serva server for Ubuntu, per these instructions, and I can't seem to get Ubuntu to load on my client machine. The config file (from that link, which says it has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.1 desktop):\nasset    = Ubuntu LTS 14.04 Desktop Live\nplatform = amd64\nkernel   = NWA_PXE/$HEAD_DIR$/casper/vmlinuz\nappend   = showmounts toram root=/dev/cifs initrd=NWA_PXE/$HEAD_DIR$/casper/initrd.lz,NWA_PXE/$HEAD_DIR$/casper/INITRD_N11.GZ boot=casper netboot=cifs nfsroot=//$IP_BSRV$/NWA_PXE_SHARE/$HEAD_DIR$ NFSOPTS=-ouser=serva,pass=avres,ro ip=dhcp ro\n\nI changed the NFSOPTS=-ouser=serva,pass=avres part to NFSOPTS=-o user=theserver, password=p4ssw0rd because it had initially complained that -ouser was a bad option. theserver and p4ssw0rd are the username and password of the user account on the server machine (Windows 7). I have also shared the appropriate Serva folder, per the instructions.\nCould someone take a look and see if it's a problem with my config file? Or could someone with more experience tell me what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: I too was facing cifs share access issue while network booting via Serva server. After much trials i realized that the username required domain as well since my Network share was hosted on a domain joined machine. Based on suggestions via internet, i was able to network boot successfully by appending text \"domain=\" to the NFSOPTS param in the ServaAsset.inf. The NFSOPTS looked like following for me:\nNFSOPTS=-ouser=,pass=,domain=,ro\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem today.\nThe problem occurred because the initial core Linux system (as it was booting) was unable to log on to the NWA_PXE_SHARE on my Windows 10 PC - Windows 10 has tougher security for shares than previous versions of Windows.\nMy solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*I added sec=ntlm to the NFSOPTS in ServaAsset.inf. This revealed an \"access denied\" error instead of the bad parameter or bad option error which is a red herring. The bad option error was reported because when the cifs logon fails, it then tries to access an NFS share which does not accept -ouser=xxx.\n\n*On the Windows 10 machine I made sure that the \"serva\" user had explicit read permissions on the \"C:\\SERVA_REPO\\NWA_PXE\" folder AND that the \"serva\" user had explicit sharing permissions set for the NWA_PXE_SHARE share.\nThen it worked.\nI arrived at this conclusion by testing the share from another (weaker) operating system which also worked.\n\nA: For me adding only 'sec' didin't resolve my problem, after debugging, i found that i need vers too:\nNFSOPTS=-ouser=serva,pass=avres,sec=ntlm,vers=1.0,ro\n\n\nA: you have to read Serva instructions.\ni.e.\nServa considers that the NWA_PXE_SHARE has a user with minimally reading access called serva with a password avres then you get\nNFSOPTS=-ouser=serva,pass=avres\n\nin your case that part of the line should be\nNFSOPTS=-ouser=theserver,pass=p4ssw0rd\n\nwhat you did adding a space after -o is wrong.\nif initially the booting says that the -ouser option is not recognized you either.\n\n\n*\n\n*didn't create the NWA_PXE_SHARE correctly\n\n*didn't download/copy INITRD_N11 correctly\n\n\nbottom line: follow Serva instructions to the letter and you will not fail.\n", "Q: How do I get the value of Display -> \"Scale for menu and title bars:\" from the command line? I did a clean clean install of 14.04 and confirmed that Display -> \"Scale for menu and title bars:\" is set to 1.\nHowever some users of the application I develop report that its set to 0.875 on clean Ubuntu installs.\nMain question:\nHow do I get the value of Display -> \"Scale for menu and title bars:\"  from the command line? I want my application to be able to check this value and response appropriately. I realize that my application should be scale agnostic, but its not, and in the short term I can't make it so.  \nSecondary question:\nIf the default value of Display -> \"Scale for menu and title bars:\" can be different to 1 on a clean install, what factors effect this?\n\nA: This setting is stored by dconf in /com/ubuntu/user-interface/scale-factor.\nUse the command\ndconf watch /com/ubuntu/user-interface/scale-factor\n\nto watch how it changes when you move the scale. Note that, apparently, the scale factor displayed in the GUI corresponds to exactly 1/8 of this value, e.g., when I set the scale factor, via the GUI, to 1 for my primary display (on DisplayPort-1) the value /com/ubuntu/user-interface/scale-factor is set to\n{'DisplayPort-0': 8, 'HDMI-0': 8, 'DVI-1': 8, 'DisplayPort-1': 8}\n\nWhen I set the scale factor to 2 I obtain\n{'DisplayPort-0': 8, 'HDMI-0': 8, 'DVI-1': 8, 'DisplayPort-1': 16}\n\nWhen I set the scale factor to 0.5 I obtain\n{'DisplayPort-0': 8, 'HDMI-0': 8, 'DVI-1': 8, 'DisplayPort-1': 4}\n\netc.\nThis is analogous for the other displays, of course. Do note that this is not one value, but an array of values, keyed with the display identifiers as returned by xrandr.\nTo change the setting via the command line, use something like\ndconf write /com/ubuntu/user-interface/scale-factor \"{'DisplayPort-0': 8, 'HDMI-0': 8, 'DVI-1': 8, 'DisplayPort-1': 8}\"\n\n", "Q: Managing Ubuntu 14.04 clients alternative landscape We are migrating some Windows pc's to Linux (Ubuntu 14.04).\nFor Windows we have a tool to manage those devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*checking invetory on pc's (which software is installed)\n\n*pushing software to the clients (batch / bash scripts)\n\n*taking over the pc's\n\n\nI saw that Ubuntu has a tool called landscape.\nIs there a free opensource alternative for this?

I used gparted to format and create the partition table as ext4.\nEverything changed as soon as I reach 2.2TB of data on the disk. After this point, I no longer could use it on my USB dock and everytime I try to use it, dmesg shows it as a 2.2TB drive:\n[787067.503166] sd 28:0:0:0: [sdc] 4294967295 512-byte logical blocks: (2.19 TB/1.99 TiB)\n\nBut, if I plug it right onto my internal SATA port it works nicely.\nThe same happens if I try to use the e-sata port from the USB dock.\n\nA: 2.2 TB ≈ 2 TiB, which corresponds to the largest number of 512-byte blocks addressable by 32 bits (232 × 512 B = 232 × 29 B = 241 = 2 × 10244 B = 2 TiB). I suspect that your USB-to-ATA bridge doesn't support more blocks or larger blocks, because it's cheap and/or old.\nDoes your storage drive allow you to set the block size to 4 KiB (Advanced Format)? Many newer drives allow the selection of a legacy mode with 512 B through a set of jumpers (see example picture below), which is often the default. If so, it's worth a try, but in that case you'll need to repartition the drive. Simply changing the jumper, trying to read the drive and changing it back, won't harm any existing data though, as long as you don't write anything while the jumper is out of its original position.\n\n", "Q: it is about Apache server , is it right or wrong what i have done? I had a question in this article and i did not have the answer i want but i managed to do this:\nin etc/apache2/sites-avaiable/000-default.conf\ni changed the DocumentRoot from  /var/www/html\nto var/www\nnow localhost through the browser opens www i can see the html folder and the test site folder i want, now i can act for every folder as a separate site as i do in windows \nso the question is what is the difference between what i have done and the ten steps way that every body trying to explain to add more sites to apache and what is the benefits of these both ways?\n\nA: Difference is in the number. Now you have one, default web host. And if it suits your needs it's perfectly fine. Benefit is when you want to run several web hosts on the same system, ie when you work on projects for several different clients and each of them needs different environment (apache settings, web app etc).\n", "Q: Is there a convenient way to change the brightness at night in Ubuntu? I know the settings menu, but is there some more convenient way (maybe with an addon)?\n\nA: You have applications like RedShift, but a very simple solution would be to put two (or more) screen brightness settings under a key combination:\n\n\n*\n\n*find out your screen name: run in a terminal xrandr, it creates an output, starting like like:\nDVI-I-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nVGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-I-1 connected primary 1680x1050+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nThe one that is followed by \"connected\" is your screen name (in this case DVI-I-1)\n\n*Now add a command and a key combination of your preference to dim the screen (System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts). The command you need to add:\nxrandr --output <your_screenname> --brightness 0.8\n\n\n*Add aonother command that sets the brightness to 1 again:\n xrandr --output <your_screenname> --brightness 1\n\nIf you set these commands under (e.g.) CTRL+1 and CTRL+2, you can dim / reset the screen brightness with two simple key combinations.\nOption 2: if you would make it automatically\n\n\n*\n\n*Create two simple scripts:\n#!/bin/bash\nxrandr --output <your_screenname> --brightness 0.8\n\nand \n#!/bin/bash\nxrandr --output <your_screenname> --brightness 1\n\n\n*Create a directory ~/bin, paste the scripts in an empty textfile, save them in ~/binas dim_screen and reset_screen (without extension) and make them both executable.\n\n*Install Alarm Clock (from the repositories). Set one or more alarm times, but instead of running an alarm, you can make it run a (single) command (called: \"Start Application\"). Use as commands:\ndim_screen\n\nand\n    reset_screen\n\n(The same as the names of the scripts)\n", "Q: Partioning Guide for manually installing ubuntu I am installing ubuntu 14.04 64Bit \"Trusty Tahr\" on my Dell inspiron laptop alongside my windows 8.\nThe laptop has an i7 processor with 8.0 GB of RAM (7.87 of which is usuable)  \nI have 100GB of unallocated free space on my hard drive set aside for my ubuntu installation and can add more if completely necessary or recomended.\nI want to know what is the best way to divide this 100GB of hard drive between root, home, and swap partitions so that my operating system will work most efficiently.\nThanks,\n\nA: My standard partitioning would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*512MB /boot ext2 - in case there is a problem with grub and loading kernel etc after a system crash, it's less possible for so small partition to be damaged then one huge root partition.\n\n*8GB Swap - OPTIONALLY(!) in most cases you don't need swap partition at all. If you don't have enough memory, add some, but 8GB looks reasonable.\n\n*12GB /  - per average Ubuntu 14.04 on my machines takes upto 4GB, so 12GB root partition should be enough\n\n* /home  - when you keep your home directory separatelly it's much easier to change whole system without touching your home dir, or move your home to other computer\n\n\nAll of this assumes you will use your laptop for some simple home/office stuff and you need a lot of space for your home directory. But if you want to run some disk space consuming services like database server, you should make much smaller home partition and much bigger root (or separate /var) partition.\n", "Q: Samba could not change the permissions of folder \"Network\" I'm currently trying to set up samba, and upon creating my first share, it asked if I wanted to set permissions automatically, and I said yes, and then I got an error saying \"Could not change the permissions of folder 'Network'\"\nIs there something I did wrong? It's a whole hard drive that I'm trying to share. The format is exFAT, and it's been set up to mount automatically.\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect and mount the drive to the Ubuntu computer. The format of the drive doesn't seem to matter.\n\n*DO NOT right-click on the drive and go into the sharing options via the drive’s properties. This will not work.\n\n*Make sure you have Samba installed. (You can find it in the Ubuntu Software Centre titled “SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix”)\n\n*Install, if you haven’t already, install the Samba GUI. (Also in the Ubuntu Software Centre titled “Samba” with a description of “Create, modify, and delete samba shares”.)\n\n*Run the Samba GUI. Search the dash for samba.\n\n*File|Add Share\n\n*Browse for the drive you wish to share and select it\n\n*Change the share name if you’d like to. (For this example my share name is “AlpahHD″)\n\n*Check “Writeable” if you wish to be able to write to this drive from other computers on the network.\n\n*Check “Visible” if you’d like others to see the share while browsing the network.\n\n*On the Access tab, select “Allow access to everyone” (This will avoid the problems of having to specify usernames and passwords in programs like XMBC and MediaPortal.)\n\n*Click OK (You should be done at this point but you’re not. This is what caused me the most headaches to find.)\n\n*Open a Terminal session (Ctrl+Alt+T)\ncd /etc/samba\nsudo gedit smb.conf\n\n(Feel free to use the editor of your choice. I like Gedit.)\n\n*Scroll to the bottom of the file. There you should find [AlpahHD] (remember that’s the name of the share I created.)\n\n*Add the following new line in that section: \nforce user = username \n\n(In my case username is “tim” since that’s the username I log in to Ubuntu with.

Why is Gimp no longer included in the installation image by default, despite the fact that Canonical has moved away from trying to make the image fit on a 700mb volume?\n\nA: GIMP was removed for a variety of reasons, including that it took a lot of space (as it ceased being included by default in 10.04, back when an Ubuntu ISO was still under 700 MB). \nIn addition, it was also found that most users did not need most of its features and that its interface was too complex for simple tasks. It was thought that most people wanted to edit photos in simple ways, so it was replaced with F-Spot (which itself was later replaced by Shotwell). For those who wished for a more serious image editor, GIMP was (and still is) easily downloaded from the Software Center. It is likely for these last reasons that GIMP has not been re-included as part of Ubuntu's default software suite.\nFor more, see this OMG Ubuntu article discussing the changes.\n\nA: I really don't think they have thought much about it, and have just tried to keep it as small as possible to allow for much faster downloads and such, though I do have to admit; it would be nice to have a checkbox upon installation that says \"download full application suite\" when connected to the internet that would download stuff like vlc, gimp, and maybe some relatively full featured trackpad management system. :P\n", "Q: Update VirtualBox to install Extension Pack I installed Virtual Box via the Software Center on the latest fully updated Ubuntu 64bit.\nI wanted to install the Extension Pack for VirtualBox but there is no version for my version of Virtual Box.\nI have VirtualBox 4.3.10 installed (as seen in Help / About VirtualBox).\nHere are only extension packages for use with other versions downloadable.\nAny suggestion what to do now? I don't want to deinstall VirtualBox and install the latest version over the website because this could be bad for future upgrades (could it? pretty new with Ubuntu).\n\nA: Virtual Box provides old builds as well as the corresponding extension pack on the Download_Old_Builds page. Specifically you should check the Download_Old_Builds_4_3 page.\nYou can use this direct link for version 4.3.10: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.10/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.10-93012.vbox-extpack\n", "Q: How can I allow anyone to read/write files on a USB stick? I've got a USB stick which is only used on Ubuntu machines, so is formatted ext4.\nThe users on my machines have various user IDs, which means that a file created by a user on one won't necessarily be readable by a user on another, and directories wont necessarily be writable by the same token.\nThe only way I've currently found around this is to run sudo chmod -R 777 /media/Username/Usbstick before unmounting, each time I create a new file or directory.  Is there a better way to do this, which will ensure anything put on removable devices is globally read/writable by default?\n\nA: I would create a fstab entry for the USB drive on each of the machines and set the uid and gid to 1000 with the desired umask. To get the UUID of the device\nsudo blkid -c /dev/null\n\nHopefully you will be able to identify your USB device ID from here. Now create a directory where the USB should be mounted.\nsudo mkdir /meda/USBDrive\n\nNow, you can create an fstab entry regarding the drive.\nsudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nUse the editor of your choice and append an entry that looks something like the following:\nUUID=ABCDEFGHIJKLKLMNOP /media/USBDrive ext4 defaults,auto,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=002 0 0\n\nYou can set the umask as desired. Umask is what determines the read write permissions and  is a 3 digit number with each of the digits between 0 and 7, and is subtracted from 777 to get the permissions. Setting umask=000 will give everyone the permission to read, write and execute all files.

Is there a way to see a desktop (see below image) instead of just a terminal.\n\n\nA: First of all, in order to access a desktop environment on ubuntu server, you need to have about 1G of ram and you need to install the \"ubuntu-desktop\" which is not included with the server by default. Do this by typing the following commands in that terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\n\nI'm not exactly sure how to access the desktop once it's installed but you need the desktop before you do anything.\nIf you don't have much ram, you can install something like Lubuntu or Xubuntu like this instead:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\n\nFor Xubuntu,\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\n\nimage credits\nhttp://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2013/12/xubuntu-1310-same-again-please-bartender.html\nhttp://news.softpedia.com/news/Lubuntu-14-04-LTS-Final-Beta-Is-Out-Can-Run-on-Any-PC-PowerPC-and-Mac-434620.shtml\n", "Q: 14.04 installation crashed - now machine is dead I was half way through an upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 when my machine crashed. At this point it had been running for over an hour doing the upgrade so I have no idea what caused it. I was merrily reading a book when the machine just rebooted. I am pretty convinced it was only about one third done with the upgrade.\nUnfortunately it did not even get to the login screen after the reboot.

Because of what I've seen of Ubuntu, I would love to see it go further into the mobile world. Does anyone know what CPUs will be supported? All the official page says for the supercomputer edition is a cortex a9 or atom. \n\nA: Whne it is finally released (it will hopefully be the same image for both phone and computer)it it will almost definitely support snapdragon and many well known arm based chipsets, I don't know about exynos chips but maybe it'll support them too. I wouldn't count on it running on older phones but I expect it will support the current flagships from most major vendors, all the way back to phones with chipsets like the snapdragon 400 or even earlier.\n\nA: If you are talking about Ubuntu Touch and the compatibility with SnapDragon CPUs, according to this Wiki, the developer version supports Nexus 4, for example, which has a SnapDragon CPU\n", "Q: How to perform partition on a drive where ubuntu is installed?

See this answer and make sure you're installing to your external, which will likely be /dev/sdb and not internal, which will likely be /dev/sda. You also have to choose your external for Bootloader Installation as in this guide.

I do not have any Windows PC available - we have Mac and Ubuntu. Is there some software I can install to make the CD images viewable?\n\nA: I realise this is 8 years old, but this answer might be useful for others with the same issue.\nMedical images are almost always in the DICOM format (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM)\nIf you’re given a cd or dvd from a healthcare provider, they will almost certainly assume you don’t have a DICOM viewer on your computer - so the cd will usually contain a viewer (a .exe file) to allow you to access the images. That is the bit that will be Windows specific.\nIt is very likely that the cd contains the viewer software and a bunch of DICOM files. You can therefore access the files using a DICOM viewer if you install a separate DICOM viewer that works on Ubuntu first.\nThere are various FOSS (or otherwise free to use) DICOM viewers available for Ubuntu; I’ve used Aeskulap (available in the software centre) in Ubuntu 20.04LTS and 22.04LTS and it works well, but there are others that are free and intuitive to use. Just search online for DICOM viewers and you’ll see some options.\n\nA: Just put the CD in the Ubuntu computer and open it with Nautilus or your desktop filesystem. If the photo format is not available to Ubuntu, you may need the \"restricted-extras\" package.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons\n\nEven though products advertise that you need Windows blah blah blah or newer doesn't actually mean it won't work on Ubuntu. Very few companies are willing to do product testing on Linux compatibility so for legal (and corporate endorsement) reasons, they only say Windows. \nUnless it's some sort of a Windows application or program and not just files, you should be more than capable of viewing the photos. \nEven if it is a Windows application, you can probably use the \"wine\" application to run the .exe or even a Linux version or clone of the equivalent Windows program.\n", "Q: Install Mini Pcie in Jetson Tk1 I'm trying to run my wireless adapter in my embedded computer running Ubuntu 14.04 (Nvidia's Jetson TK1 Kernel: 3.10.24).

I use an external wifi adapter connected to my USB port on my laptop as a source for network connection. What I need to do is to extend that signal to my peripherals (=android phone. not rooted) using my inbuilt wireless network card on my laptop for broadcasting. I've installed hostapd and used the AP-hotspot script. Although it did create the hotspot and my phone was able to connect to it, it wouldn't let me use my external wireless card as a source for internet connection at the same time as using my inbuilt card for broadcasting or repeating the signal, which is what I need to do. Any suggestions, help or links related to this issue would be appreciated.\n\nA: I just tried this out to verify that it works. No hostapd and no script. (I tried wp5.sh but it wouldn't work.)

All I needed to do was to configure the hostapd.conf file with minimal settings, no script or additional applications required. What I did was that I first created an Ad-hoc network with Network Manager, as described in previous answer, and made sure I was connected to it on wlan0 and that I still had access to internet through wlan1. I then created the etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf file with typical configuration and set hostapd to start up at boot (see step 1 from How to setup an Access Point mode Wi-Fi Hotspot? ). I then started hostapd through terminal and the AP-hotspot was created instantly, detected on all my devices and able to connect with access to internet. That's all! No need to install conflicting software, forwarding IP:s etc, since Network Manager already taken care of the settings when setting up the ad-hoc network and hostapd automatically reuses those settings when creating the AP-hotspot.\n", "Q: What is the Google Calendar webapp good for?

Following steps I found online, I marked as failed and removed the drive from the raid.\nI replaced the drive with an exact make and model but with the new drive in, the raid won't start.  cat /proc/mdstat just says its inactive.\nI also can not add the new drive to the raid, keeps saying no superblock on the new drive even though I copied the partition from the working drive to the new one.\nI removed the new drive and put back in the failed one.

Even the guest session does not work !\n When I tried \"ctrl + alt + del\" during boot to start in recovery mode, it still boots & this time the touchpad or mouse is not working.\nI should have not gambled since I recently migrated completely to Ubuntu overwriting Windows. Is there a way to solve this problem or at least can I recover the data from the system; allowing me to reinstall the OS?\n\nA: You should be able to press CTRL + ALT + F1 to get a virtual console and log in to recover data using the command prompt and fix your drivers. To revert back to a GUI session siply press CTRL + ALT + F7. Alternatively, you can get the grub menu by pressing shift while booting and the boot into recovery to get a command prompt. \nOnce you have the command prompt you can remove the AMD drivers\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx*\n\nYou can now reinstall xorg\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg\n\nand then\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n\nA: You should be able to get into the grub menu by pressing shift as your computer boots.

I would like to set up a Terminal server and connect 4 or 5 \"terminals\" running Ubuntu desktop for a small school. In functional terms, I'd like the students to be able to log on to their accounts from any machine, using a username and password. \nI'm a real newbie at networking, but I've been using Ubuntu for several years and I have a programming background. \nWhere should I begin?\nThanks in advance! \n\nA: There are many ways to do this. I would recommend a solution based on LDAP for authentication and user management, and NFS for storage.\nIn the following, I assume that by \"Terminals\" you do not mean X server forwarding, but actual local sessions. For actual terminal servers the server runs the applications, and the client simply displays the \"GUI\". More info on that setup here.\nThat also reminds me: Edubuntu might be worth a look for you.\nUser management\nYou need a centralized database to store usernames and passwords. LDAP is one solution for that. It is a database running on your server, and the clients use the linux PAM architecture to connect to it for authentication.\nHow to set up LDAP\nStorage\nNFS is a network file system. Simplified, this means that you can mount it over the network, just like a local partition. In a nutshell, it is similar to smb, the windows \"shared drives\" protocol. In your case, you would mount the user's home directory from the central NFS server after login.\nHow to set up NFS\n", "Q: Is it possible to edit Textboxes in a browser using VIM or a VIM-Style-Editor?

So I would recommend you Pentadactyl – an extension for Firefox. Besides vi-like keybindings for browsing / navigation and lots of attendant features, it also provides both possibilities, you’ve asked. \n\n\n*\n\n*External editor for textareas and textboxes, which is GVim by default, can be launched by <C-i>.\n\n*Basic internal vi-style editor (so called ‘Text edit’ mode) is available by pressing <C-t> or can be configured to start directly when textarea / textbox is focused by :set noinsertmode. Unfortunately, it seems to be unmaintained now and therefore has several important issues which unlikely to be fixed. For instance it handles non-ASCII characters (like ä, п) improperly while doing word-movements (w, e, b, etc).\n\n\n(Both hotkeys can be remapped of course.)\n\nA: If you do not mind having a second window opening, the right option is It's all text extension.

These CSD (client-side decorations) don't work properly in some desktop environments / shells - for instance, in Ubuntu 14.04, Unity doesn't support CSD and because of this, some applications look broken. \nUbuntu 14.04 or 14.10 users can install gtk3-nocsd by using the main WebUpd8 PPA.

Everything looks mixed up.\nSo what is the role of the ! command here? Why does it mess up the entire sorting behaviour?According to https://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118/2105986, it is supposed to be a filter operator.\n\nA: The ! character in the vi command mode causes vi to use the external application sort to sort the lines.\nYour first command :1,$sort causes vi to use it's internal sort mechanism. In your second command :1,$!sort all lines are taken and given as standard input to the application sort.\nJust try this vi command: :!ls -la. You will see the output of ls and after pressing Enter you get back to vi. That mechanism is usually (for example) to compile the code written in vi without closing and reopening the file.\nSo you see, using ! in this case causes complete different mechanisms. The ubuntu sort utility may sort different than the vi internal one.\n\nA: According to that answer, 1,$!sort is the ex-mode version. You enter ex-mode by typing Q in normal mode. The normal mode version of this command is 1G!Gsort according to that SO answer.

How to download a package with all its dependencies So that it can be installed later on another computer without the internet.\nI tried at Official packages for Ubuntu. But it also needs to be download individually all dependencies.\n\nA: To see a list of a packages dependencies and to also see if the dependencies are already installed, use the application apt-rdepends\nsudo apt-get apt-rdepends\n\nTo list dependencies and status of all dependencies as well use 'apt-rdepends -p' like this:\napt-rdepends -p packagename \n\nexample:\napt-rdepends -p sl\n\nThe output will show the dependencies for the package \"sl\", the dependencies of the depnedencies, the dependencies of the dependencies dependencies etc.\nThe output will also show if these are installed or not installed on the computer (status).\n\nAnother option, try to get all of the installation packages installed on the box with no internet so that you can just build the packages from source. The source code ususally has the package dependencies that get compiled along with the package. What is not included is the build dependencies you need to compile the code. It's pretty straightforward; most of the time, the build compile and or make installation instructions are described in the \"README\" , the readme.md (markdown), or the \"INSTALL\" file. If automake, run ./autogen.sh first, then run ./configure, make, make install.\nYou can build from source with \nsudo apt-get build-dep packagename\nsudo apt-get source packagename\n\nReplace \"packagename\" with the actual package name, of course.\nThis will first install the build-dependencies needed to compile and install the package (you can take note of what these are) and then, will download the source archives. You must have the \"source code\" repositories enabled in your /etc/apt/sources.list file (uncomment all \"deb-src\" entries) or in the ubuntu-software-center to download the source code.\nSource code can also be downloaded from the projects website or better yet cloned from \"github\"\nAlso, if you have python installed, you can install python packages downloaded from pypi.python.org/\nFor example, to download and install \"youtube-dl\" you can download the source code from https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/y/youtube_dl/youtube_dl-2014.08.10.tar.gz#md5=d5d259bf8a2ec1b7bf3b744c173308d9 unzip the package in your home directory ( ~/ ) and to install, you would run these commands:\ncd youtube_dl-2014.08.10\npython setup.py install\n\nif you get an error you may need to use sudo python setup.py install instead.

USB pendrives are simply not fast enough for this workload. Why don't you install the OS on a disk?\nAnd regarding the swap question.

The passphrase unlocks a master decryption key stored in the header, which in turn decrypts your partition.

Sorry for my bad english since i'm not native.\n\nA: postmaster.pid should be absent if the server isn't running. That's correct. It's the process ID of the running PostgreSQL server, and if there isn't one, there's not going to be a postmaster.pid unless the server stopped abruptly, in which case it'll contain the pid of the old postmaster from before the crash until PostgreSQL is restarted, at which point PostgreSQL will replace it with the pid of the new postmaster.\nYou never need to mess with postmaster.pid.

I used the ls -a command to see the .bash_profile, but there isn't such a file.\n\nA: That means the file does not exist. But, you can create the file and bash executes/sources the file if bash is invoked as a login shell. So evertime you login via a shell (for example via ssh).\nIf you want the content to execute everytime you open a terminal, then you should modify the .bashrc file instead.\n\nA: Top answer to use ~/.profile instead of ~/.bash_profile did not work for me.  \nModifying .bashrc worked  \nJust:\nvim ~/.bashrc\n\nNote: I'm using Ubuntu WSL.  \n\nA: When invoking a login shell bash will looks for its config files in this order:\n[0] ~/.bash_profile\n[1] ~/.bash_login\n[2] ~/.profile\n\nAfter finding the first one, it stops looking for the others so if there is a .bash_profile in my $HOME bash will not look for .bash_login and .profile anymore.\nFrom these three file names, Ubuntu by default uses .profile you can rename it to .bash_profile if you like:\nmv ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile\n\nNow if we open a new bash shell using bash -l, su - $USER, sudo -u $USER -i or any other commands that runs bash as a login shell, ~/.bash_profile will get sourced.\nImportant to note:\nWhat I have talked about till now only applies to Bash itself, when you are logging into the system from a GUI, the display manager is responsible of sourcing the correct files.\nUbuntu uses gdm3 as its display manager, if we take a look at: /etc/gdm3/Xsession we can see that none of the files will get sourced except: .profile:\n# First read /etc/profile and .profile\nfor file in /etc/profile \"$HOME/.profile\"; do\n  if [ -f \"$file\" ]; then\n    source_with_error_check \"$file\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nso if you are using a GUI to login, keep the file under .profile name otherwise you might miss some variables and settings in your environments.\nI guess the better option is creating a symlink to .profile:\nln -s ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile\n\nNow your data lives in .profile, gdm doesn't miss anything, bash loads .bash_profile which is actually .profile, and by editing each of them you get the same result.\nMissing .profile?\nIf you don't have .profile then grab a copy of it  from here:\ncp /etc/skel/.profile ~/.profile\n\nor \n# Remember the note above\ncp /etc/skel/.profile ~/.bash_profile\n\n\nA: Ubuntu uses ~/.profile .\nyou can create your .bash_profile in Ubuntu but then .profile will not be read.\nIf we read .profile content :\ncat ~/.profile\n\noutput\n# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.\n# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login\n# exists.\n\nSo use ~/.profile instead of ~/.bash_profile\n\nA: If you mean the .bashrc you will find it in your home folder.

I increased the niceness, to see if I could reduce the load. Then I tried to reduce the nice of the same process back to it's initial level and was told I didn't have proper privileges. Is there a good reason for the disparity in privileges required here?\n\nA: Yes. When every user in the system has the possibility to decreace the niceness of his process, then every user can cause other processes to starve.\nProcess priorities in the linux kernel do mean something. If you give a process the nice value of -20 it gets huge chunks of cpu time. That's why only root can decrease those values.\nAddition suggested by Eliah Kagan:\n\nWhy users cannot get their own processes back to the niceness level\n  they themselves started them with?\n\nThe point is, the system doesn't note who did the increase of the niceness. So, there is no mechanism to find out whether you or root did the incease.\nAnother approach is to say: a normal user shouldn't be able to overwrite the actions of a priviledged user. If root is logged in and he wants to change the niceness of your processes to 20: he can, and you should be prohibited to undo that changes. Untill the kernel doesn't remember who did the niceness changes, you will be prohibited.\nMaybe some day the linux kernel developers include that functionality to the kernel code.

However, they are not usually set up to do so, for safety and security reasons. \nPlus the fact that only root is generally permitted by default to mount devices and file-systems on such systems, also for safety and security measures.  \nSafety and security can refer to viruses, hackers, malware, fraud, phishing, spam identity theft, etc.\n", "Q: Failed to suspend due to nouveau failure There are many questions about failed suspension on ubuntu ([1][2]), but each \nof them seem so specific that I'm posting mine.\nIn my case, sometimes (very randomly) my XP15 does not suspend.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 updated to current date.\nMy syslog states:\n\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32564.982253] Suspending console(s) (use no_console_suspend to debug)\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32564.982580] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] Synchronizing SCSI cache\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32564.982615] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Synchronizing SCSI cache\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32564.984880] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Stopping disk\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32564.985451] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] Stopping disk\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32565.032197] nouveau  [     DRM] suspending display...\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32565.032205] nouveau  [     DRM] unpinning framebuffer(s)...\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32565.032208] nouveau  [     DRM] evicting buffers...\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32565.032210] nouveau  [     DRM] waiting for kernel channels to go idle...\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32565.032250] nouveau  [     DRM] suspending client object trees...\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32565.033027] nouveau  [     DRM] suspending kernel object tree...\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.035761] nouveau E[   PDISP][0000:01:00.0][0xc000857c][ffff88042386bb80] fini timeout, 0xc2061008\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.035764] nouveau E[   PDISP][0000:01:00.0][0xc000857c][ffff88042386bb80] failed suspend, -16\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.035766] nouveau E[     DRM] 0xd1500000:0xd15c7c00 suspend failed with -16\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.035804] nouveau E[     DRM] 0xdddddddd:0xd1500000 suspend failed with -16\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.035922] nouveau E[     DRM] 0xffffffff:0xdddddddd suspend failed with -16\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.036633] nouveau E[     DRM] 0xffffffff:0xffffffff suspend failed with -16\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.036757] nouveau  [     DRM] resuming display...\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.036785] nouveau E[     DRM] bo ffff880036980000 pinned elsewhere: 0x00000002 vs 0x00000004\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.036788] [drm:drm_helper_resume_force_mode] *ERROR* failed to set mode on crtc ffff88041f020000\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.044935] pci_pm_suspend(): nouveau_pmops_suspend+0x0/0xb0 [nouveau] returns -16\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.044939] dpm_run_callback(): pci_pm_suspend+0x0/0x150 returns -16\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.044945] PM: Device 0000:01:00.0 failed to suspend async: error -16\nAug 12 23:20:24 ged kernel: [32567.045007] PM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected\n\nAs it seems the problem is on the video card.\nThe result from lspci | grep VGA returns.\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF108M [GeForce GT 540M] (rev a1)\n\nWhich is strange, is that I'm not using the NVIDIA card (since both nouveau and official drivers are not stable in my machine).\nAny hints for a next step?\n\nA: I think it's the same problem reported as \"laptop suspend broken after latest kernel update\".\nPlease report that this bug affects you at Bug #1329689\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut increase/decrease font size when using Guake?

This binary file is required by the XSane scanning package to correctly communicate with the scanner. The firmware file can be here:\nStep 2:\nOpen the terminal and type the command ''sudo nautilus'' command. This will open a file browser with root permissions.\nGo to this path:''/usr/share/sane/'' and create a folder with name: ''gt68xx''\nCopy the file ''CCD569.fw'' from where you have located it, into the folder ''/usr/share/sane/gt68xx''\nStep 3:\nClose the file browser (with elevated permissions) and the terminal.\nDelete any 'temp' folder that you may have created.\nYou are now ready to start scanning with 'Xsane' and with 'Simple Scan' applications.\nNote:\nXsane is much better scanning package than Simple Scan becouse it give us a complete control of all possible parameters, which are automatically saved on exit.\n", "Q: bash utility 'dialog' leaves a messy screen When I run this script it displays options in a menu style on my terminal and then runs the relavent command in the script.\n\n#!/bin/sh\nTEMP=/tmp/answer$$\ndialog --ascii-lines --title \"Administrative tasks\"  --menu  \"Tasks :\" 20 0 0 1 \"Display firewall settings\" 2 \"Restore firewall settings\" 3 \"Flush Firewall settings\" 2>$TEMP\nchoice=`cat $TEMP`\ncase $choice in\n        1)      iptables -L\n                ;;\n        2)      iptables-restore </etc/iptables.firewall.rules\n                iptables -L\n                ;;\n        3)      iptables --flush\n                iptables -L\n                ;;\nesac\necho Selected $choice\n\nBut when it exits the screen is messed up.\nIs there a way to \"save\" the state of screen before I ran this and restore it?\nIs there a better \"Windows\" scripting program that runs in a text screen?\n\n\nA: The dialog manpage mentions whiptail (in a rather deprecating fashion).

It is also a dependency of ubuntu-minimal, so it should be installed on all Ubuntu systems by default (at least, as of 14.04).\n\nA: I know it's late, but maybe you want to switch to the alternate screen (like nano, vim, and others do), so you could give a try to the --keep-tite option.\nFrom the dialog's man page:\n\n--keep-tite: Normally dialog checks to see if it is running in an xterm, and in that case tries to suppress the initialization strings that would make it switch to the alternate screen. Switching between the normal and alternate screens is visually distracting in a script which runs dialog several times. Use this option to allow dialog to use those initialization strings. \n\nHere's an example:\necho \"Write something before invoking dialog.\"\ndialog --keep-tite --msgbox \"Hello world!\" 0 0\n\nAfter the user hits OK, the output printed before invoking dialog ... is restored.\n\nA: Just add clear after the dialog line:\n...\ndialog --ascii-lines --title \"Administrative tasks\"  --menu  \"Tasks :\" 20 0 0 1 \"Display firewall settings\" 2 \"Restore firewall settings\" 3 \"Flush Firewall settings\" 2>$TEMP\nclear #clears the terminal screen\nchoice=`cat $TEMP`\ncase $choice in\n...\n\n\nA: This is possible with the screen command.\nrun this using screen as below,\nscreen bash yourcommand.sh\n\nThis would show the dialog screen then collect the choice.\nAlso this would restore the existing screen on exit.\n", "Q: Need help creating shortcuts on the desktop in ubuntu Just wondering how do I add desktop shortcuts in Ubuntu.

Some commands have very large output texts in terminal. Sometimes some lines of texts goes out of the terminal during command execution. How to get that texts?\nUpdate:\nI mean the terminal that comes with Ubuntu(12.04).\n\nA: When typing your command pipe it into \"less\" this allows you to scroll with the up/down arrows for example: ls -l|less Assuming you are talking about the standard bash terminal that is, which you probably are.\n\nA: Also worth mentioning, you can use tee to send the output both to a file and to STDOUT:\n$ ls -al 2>&1 | tee currDir.txt\n\nThis will list the files in the current directory, while also writing them to currDir.txt.  Note that the addition of 2>&1 will also allow this to capture anything sent to STDERR.\n\nA: Even though the pipe solution (with more, less and tee) would be cleaner, you can also have your terminal keep more lines of output in its window (so that you can scroll up to it).\nIn Ubuntu 12.04, the usual terminal is gnome-terminal. Open one, and get to the preferences window (Edit > Preferences). In the Scrolling tab, you'll see a scrollback value, which should be set at 512 lines by default. This value represents the number of lines the terminal will keep available for you to scroll up to. You can increase this value, or check the Unlimited box.\nAlso remember that the more lines you have your terminal keep, the more memory it takes to do so.\n\nA: 1) You can use more or less with pipe\nL10@Leo10:~$ command | more \nL10@Leo10:~$ command | less \nor else\n2) You can redirect the command output to another file using >\nL10@Leo10:~$ command > output \nafter execution of above, you can use any text editors to view the output file.\n\nA: In \"clean cases\" (there's no term manipulation like what curses & do) you can also try if Shift-PgUp does anything. This will allow scrolling to some amount, usually a hundred lines or so. To cover more ground, use the methods others have pointed out.\n", "Q: Dropbox behind a proxy under ubuntu 14.04 server Is it possible to install dropbox under an ubuntu 14.04 server that is behind a proxy with credentials ?\n\nA: You have to provide proxy authentication to install Dropbox.

After the upgrade completed and I tried to restart, the boot process crashes with a kernel panic, see screenshot below:\n\nThe same problem occurs when I try and boot directly from a USB stick  from the .iso image.\nVersion 13.10 however works just fine (I have to reinstall this old version now)\n\nA: I'll be upgrading my ASUS eee to 14.04 (32bit) next week.

Yesterday, as always, I suspended my Ubuntu 14.04 (Unity) laptop for night. Today as I open it up it shows login screen (lightdm) but it is impossible to write password in. I see password field but it is not editable (the coursor does not blink; I do not see dots as I type). I am able to move the mouse coursor. Also, I am able to login into terminal by CTRL+ALT+F1. As I run the \"top\" command I see that my (not root) process \"init\" uses 100% CPU.\nIt would not be such a big issue since I can restart lightdm. However, the main problem is I have opened several Chrome Incognito windows with important tabs in it. I would like to somehow get access to these windows and save open tabs. Is it possible?\nI see two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Somehow unfreeze login screen to normally login.\n\n*Forget about login and somehow save Chrome Incognito sessions from the terminal.\n\n\nUnfortunately I do not know how to do this. I would be very gratefull for any help. \n\nA: Well do the following. Do not logout from anywhere.\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\n\n*Log on to tty.\n\n\n*Install remote desktop to your computer.\n$ sudo apt-get install xrdp\n\n\n*Log on to Ubuntu with another computer. Use $ ifconfig to list your IP.\n\n\n\n\n*Save all you incognito tabs (right-click on a tab and select \"Bookmark all tabs\" or hit Ctrl+Shift+D).\n\n\n*On your tty shell, execute\n$ sudo service lightdm restart\n\n\n*You should be logged out of Unity and the login screen would be unfrozen.\nWhy the workaround? Chromium developers went to a lot of trouble to ensure that Chromium does not save any state information in incognito mode. It's probably possible to write a script to get all open tabs, even incognito, but that'll only get you the URLs. Not worth the effort in my opinion. I would sill like to see if somebody can show how to do it that way.\n\nA: I seem to have the same problem since a few weeks.\nSometimes I can't type the password at the cursor, even when I click there. The workaround is then to click in the top right corner of the screen and select \"switch account\"; an unfrozen login screen appears.\nSometimes there is no button or place to type or any user interface elements for that matter, just my username and a frozen screen. The workaround I found for this is this: have a guest session running next to normal session. Then use ctrl-alt-F8 to switch to this guest session, something I found out to be possible. Then this takes a while, and then switch account. Then there is an unfrozen login screen. \nOnly works if there is already a guest session open.\nOh yeah also the computer now doesn't wake up when I open the lit, I have to click the power button.\nEverything takes 10 times as long as normal and this is a mayor headache bug, since before it took about 2-3 seconds to resume my session, now I must pay attention not to close my lit if I may need my computer fast at some point, which is, generally, always.\nUbuntu 14.04, thinkpad t440s w/ touchscreen\n", "Q: Custom Keyboard Shortcuts Lost After 12.04 to 14.04 Upgrade I used to have a lot of custom shortcuts on my user session, Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts.

Every time I create a bridge\nbrctl addbr br0\nbrctl addif br0 eth0\n\nIt causes eth0 to drop out, which I now know is expected behavior.

Can anyone tell me the difference between ctrl+z and ctrl+c?\nWhen I am in the terminal, both the combinations stop the current process, but what exactly is the difference between both?\n\nA: To put it simply:\n\n*\n\n*CTRL-C requests that the program abort.\n\n\n*CTRL-Z suspends the program and it remains resident as a background task.\nSuspending a program allows you to resume it later with the command fg. Remaining background tasks are killed when you exit the login shell.\nNote that CTRL-C only requests that a program abort, and the program may ignore the request.  CTRL-Z will suspend the program unless the program specifically overrides the request.\n\nA: This should help \n\nCtrl+Z is used for suspending a process by sending it the signal SIGSTOP, which cannot be intercepted by the program. While Ctrl+C is used to kill a process with the signal SIGINT, and can be intercepted by a program so it can clean its self up before exiting, or not exit at all.\n\n\nA: when you press ctrl+c, it means you send SIGINT to your process. like you type this command: kill -SIGINT <your_pid>. It will kill you your process. That why you cannot see it when issue ps command.\nWhen you press ctrl+z, it means you send SIGSTOP to your process. like you type this command: kill -SIGKSTOP <your_pid>. It will stop your process, but the process still alive. So you can re-activate your process by sending SIGCONT to your process. \n\nA: Ctrl+C is used to kill a process with signal SIGINT, in other words it is a polite kill .\nCtrl+Z  is used to suspend a process by sending it the signal SIGTSTP, which is like a sleep signal, that can be undone and the process can be resumed again.\nHowever when a process is suspended, we can resume it again by fg (resume in foreground) and bg (resume in background) , but I can't resume a killed process, that is a difference between using Ctrl+C & Ctrl+Z.\nHow can we view suspended processes?\nThe jobs command gives output like this:\n[1]-  Stopped                 cat\n[2]+  Stopped                 vi\n\nHow to kill a suspended process in background?\nBy using the kill command:\nkill %n where n is the number displayed by the jobs command. So if I want to kill cat: kill %1.\n\nA: Control+Z suspends a process (SIGTSTP) and Control+C interrupts a process (SIGINT)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Z \n\nOn Unix-like systems, Control+Z is the most common default keyboard mapping for the key sequence that suspends a process\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-C\n\nIn POSIX systems, the sequence causes the active program to receive a SIGINT signal. If the program does not specify how to handle this condition, it is terminated. Typically a program which does handle a SIGINT will still terminate itself, or at least terminate the task running inside it\n\n\nA: If we leave edge cases to one side, the difference is simple. Control+C aborts the application almost immediately while Control+Z shunts it into the background, suspended.\nThe shell send different signals to the underlying applications on these combinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Control+C (control character intr) sends SIGINT which will interrupt the application. Usually causing it to abort, but this is up to the application to decide.\n\n*Control+Z (control character susp) sends SIGTSTP to a foreground application, effectively putting it in the background, suspended. This is useful if you need to break out of something like an editor to go and grab some data you needed. You can go back into the application by running fg (or %x where x is the job number as shown in jobs).\nWe can test this by running nano TEST, then pressing Control+Z and then running ps aux | grep TEST. This will show us the nano process is still running:\noli     3278  0.0  0.0  14492  3160 pts/4    T    13:59   0:00 nano TEST\n\nFurther, we can see (from that T, which is in the status column) that the process has been stopped. So it's still alive, but it's not running... It can be resumed.\nSome applications will crash if they have ongoing external processes (like a web request) that might timeout while they're asleep.\n", "Q: How can I tease Sonicwall?

For I use all websites in my college? \nPlease see the result when I access a website blocked \n \nI already tried use non-proxy but it didn't worked.  \nThanks! \n\nA: Something I do to get around issues like this: a SOCKS5 proxy over ssh.  If you've got a linux box outside of the network, you can do something like:\nnohup ssh -D 8000 -C -N user@host > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\nThis will open a secure ssh tunnel to your host, giving you a SOCKS5 proxy on port 8000, and disassociate it with the terminal (so you can close the window without losing your connection. To disconnect, you'd just need to kill the pid.)\nPoint your browser to your new proxy: localhost:8000, and go.  To get apt to use the proxy, you'd need to edit /etc/apt/apt.conf to containt the following line:\nAcquire::socks::proxy \"socks://localhost:8000/\";\n\nYou probably would also want to point CLI utilities through your proxy, so you need to add it to your shell environment:\nexport SOCKS_SERVER=localhost:8000;\n\nYou can add this to your ~/.bashrc (assuming you are using bash) to make it available in all (new) terminal sessions.\n", "Q: Burg install error Im trying to install Burg bootloader.

During an install (twice now) all graphics display perfectly.\n\nA: IMHO, Ubuntu is not a good candidate for old hardware, try Xubuntu instead. It's less pretty, but should run snappier, and it also doesn't need recent OpenGL enabled graphics with a decent driver support.\nVIA's graphics are known to have bad reputation in the Linux world. There are a least two drivers, both incomplete, and porly maintained. If the AGP slot on the board works, it's worth getting an Nvidia card, even something like FX5200.\nSearching for a driver for computer X, downloading an installation file, doubleclicking, and going through a wizard is something you'd do with Windows. Linux doesn't have that, in fact, graphics drivers in linux are a mess with various components, not always compatible with each other, worked on by different devs, not easily installable or upgradable, etc.\n", "Q: install package from ubuntu dvd I want to install some package from ubunu 14.04 LTS dvd.

Instead of an \"access-point\" this sets up an \"ad-hoc\" network using network-manager. \"ad-hoc\" uses wireless abg instead of wireless-n. \nSharing wifi from a wireless router to my laptop internal card (wlan0) to an acer chromebook from the laptop usb (wlan1). For some reason I couldn't get my internal card (wlan0) to broadcast.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the network-manager indicator and select \"create new wifi\nnetwork\" from the dropdown menu.\n\n*I first selected the wlan1 card and named the network \"pineapples\".\n\n*I have it set to ad-hoc and under ipv4 it's set to \"share connection\nwith other computers\", no security.\nAlso, as \"pineapples\" was resolving on the laptop, I clicked to connect to \"pineapples\" on the chromebook as soon as the network appeared; then, the two computers connected to each other.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the laptop drops or doesn't connect to \"pineapples\", it should\nstill be listed as an available network from the network-manager\ndropdown list. Click to connect to the \"pineapples\" network on the laptop and while it is resolving, connect to \"pineapples\" from the other device.\n\n\nAt first, I had no access to the internet or any websites but I clicked on my wlan0 network to reset the connection to the router and now both computers have internet.\n", "Q: Ubuntu \"Wubildr.mbr is missing or contains errors.\" I want to get Ubuntu on my laptop (HP Pavilion) but every time I try to install it using Wubi, I get this error:\nWubildr is missing or contains errors.\n\nWhat could be the problem?\nI had Ubuntu on this laptop before so it can't be anything with UEFI. I also even tried a full installation. It would either come up with the same error or this:\nPlease insert a bootable medium. Press any key to reboot.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately wubi is no longer supported and the absolute most reliable way to install is by booting a livecd/usb that you have burned. On windows 8 based systems wubi has been proven to not work at all.\n", "Q: How to discover workstation or server is installed Is there a way to discover if an installed OS is workstation or server? Is it just a matter of the packages that are installed or is there some difference that can be detected?\n\nA: Just the set of packages installed. You can start off with an Ubuntu Server installation and install ubuntu-desktop package to get the desktop OS. There is no guarantee that the absence of a *-desktop package implies a server OS, or that the presence of X11 implies a desktop OS.\n\nA: I did find some interesting files in /var/log/installer:\nmedia-info says \"Ubuntu-Server\" for the server and just \"Ubuntu\" for desktop. syslog shows the same information for the \"cdrom\"\nor from the terminal run:\ncat /var/log/installer/media-info\n\nor, if the file doesn't exist, try:\ncat /var/log/installer/lsb-release\n\nBoth of these are helpful and I can use them in conjunction with hardware information.\n", "Q: Why does Server 14.04.1 install the boot loader to my USB drive instead of the hard disk? Ok, I don't know that's what it's doing. What I know is that, after I finish installing the OS, I pull out the thumb drive to reboot, and at that point the computer just sits there. I figure, \"Hey, that install must be broke,\" so I put the thumb drive back in there to try again--and lo, it works!\nWhat gives? How do I make it STOP THAT?!\nP.S. Because you almost have to ask, I'm using guided LVM with encryption, and I'm picking the 750 gig hard disk to partition (not the one gig usb), because I don't think I'm qualified to decide how to partition my disks and decide what gets installed where.\n...Then again, it's starting to feel like I'm more qualified than the installer. :)\n\nA: If you try picking \"something else\" on the page that asks you where and how you want to install it, you can select where you want the bootloader. You will have to set up which disk to use for the / mount point and elect to use encryption manually but it will let you choose where to install the bootloader and should at least get you a fully bootable, fully functional, system.\n\nA: This is how I fixed this problem on my machine:\nRecreate your install USB.\nBoot to USB and select Fix A Broken System.\nGo through the prompts.\nSelect Re-install GRUB Bootloader and enter /dev/sda for location.\nSelect Reboot system.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: What I actually did: jerk out the install media before the installer noticed it. Kind of the worst/best solution ever, if you ask me.\nThe other suggestions here will probably work if you understand enough about installing Linux to understand... Well, you know. What they were talking about. That said, I really had neither the know-how nor the patience to go about babying Ubuntu into actually working, so \"pull out USB stick before boot loader option screen\" has a certain charm, as answers go.\n", "Q: Nautilus No Window Bar After Upgrade to 14.04 After upgrading today to 14.04 from 12.04, I noticed that Nautilus has no window bar.

Can someone please show me what I needed to do to restore it?\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: Yoy would need to go back to a previous Gnome release, client side decorations is now how Gnoe Core apps handle window decoration, merging the toolbar with the window controls.\n", "Q: why does directory contain 2 hard links When I create a new directory it contain 2 hard links and when I go inside to the new directory it contain two directories (. and ..) . has hard link count 2 and .. has hard link count 3, but I learn that directory can not contain more than one hard link. can anyone explain this scenario ? \n\nA: Every directory has a link to itself and its parent (that's why . of an empty directory will have a link count of 2). But because every directory links to its parent, any directory that has a subdirectory will have a link from that child. Thus the link count of a directory is 2 + the number of directories immediately contained by it.\n", "Q: cjpeg fails \"unrecognized file input format --- perhaps you need -targa\" I'm using 14.04.1 LTS (server), I have installed the following: libjpeg8 libjpeg62 libjpeg-turbo8 libjpeg-progs libjpeg-turbo-progs\nThe image file in question returns this with the file command (I split into two lines):\n$ file image.jpg\nimage.jpg JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, \ncomment: \"CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v62), quality = 100\"\n\nWhen I run cjpeg image.jpg I get the following error:\nUnrecognized input file format --- perhaps you need -targa\n\nFollowing the advice, I run cjpeg -targa image.jpg:\nInvalid or unsupported Targa file\n\nSearching google brought up a lot of source code files for various packages that call cjpeg and had bits of the error message in question spread throughout the file but nothing referenced the same error I am getting.\n\nA: You get this error simply because you tried to compress an unsupported file (such as a JPG file), from the cjpeg man page:\n\ncjpeg compresses the named image file, or the standard input if no file\n     is named, and produces a JPEG/JFIF file on the  standard  output.

You were just missing one character.\nls -la | vim -\n\n\nA: Here's another approach, hopefully to teach someone something new.\nIf you know that the command :r !ls -la works inside vim, you can do the following to open vim and make it run the command as soon as it opens, straight from bash:\nvim -c ':r! ls -la'\n\nThis is the equivalent of opening vim then executing the command :r! ls -la. This should work with any vim command, where the command comes after the -c option.\n\nA: You can use process substitution (this also works with applications that can't read from STDIN):\nvim <(ls -la)\n\nOr use vim's function to read from STDIN:\nls -la | vim -\n\n\nA: You can tell vim to open stdin:\nls -la | vim -\n\n\nA: setlocal buftype=nofile\nThis is a good option if you are going to create an alias to replace less:\nseq 100 | vim +':setlocal buftype=nofile' -\n\nNow you don't need to type the ! to quit.\nAnother option is:\nseq 100 | vim +'nnoremap q :quit!' -\n\nso you can exit with just q<enter>.\n\nA: If your goal is simply to get the output into a text file then you don't need to invoke vim.

I am moving over my business infrastructure from Microsoft products to Ubuntu 14.04, although I am also trialling CentOS and straight Debian too. I currently have everything running on a pair of VMWare 4.1 hosts running on two Dell PE2950III servers (2xquad Intel Zeons and 64GB RAM each). Both hosts are current as far as updates are concerned.\nEverything is going OK apart from an issue with the Ubuntu desktop when accessed via vCenter console - if I set the display to anything higher than 800x600 the screen and launcher is duplicated every 800 pixels to the right. This also covers anything that should be there.\nI understand that Ubuntu 14.04 uses 3D acceleration which I'm sure the standard VMWare display driver doesn't support. I have tried every video RAM setting in vSphere and every possible screen resolution within ubuntu over 800x600 and still get the same affect.\nI have installed the open_vm_tools package with no luck. I have seen a few suggestions of moving down to an earlier version but I would like to get 14.04 working if possible. As a beginner I like the ease of use that Ubuntu gives me while I'm learning.\nThanks guys.\n\nA: I've cracked it :) By accident I installed kernel 3.14.0-031400 rebooted and vCenter console now shows my desktops correctly. I downloaded this version quite by accident but glad I did as the latest version (3.16.1Utopic) doesn't fix the issue. I'm going to leave it at this for the time being as I have lots of learning and work to do before I can fully move all of my infrastructure over to Linux.\nHope the above helps others in the same position as me.\n", "Q: Problems upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04 I'm a complete Linux newbie using Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop and now wanting to upgrade to 14.04.

Your entire Ubuntu installation is in /. This includes all your applications, music, pictures, videos, etc. (Your personal files are usually stored in /home/(username)/). If you can clear/copy some of those to another location, you'll free up space in /. \nYou could also run sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean to free up a little more space \nYour home directory is mounted on a 220G partition and your root directory(/) is mounted on a 7.4G partition. I'd recommend resizing the / partition (/dev/sda1) to 15G or so. You can use a tool like gparted to resize partitions. \nIf you don't want to resize the partition sudo do-release-upgrade *might* work.\nCould you post your replies as comments on this post? Otherwise the original post gets cluttered.\nIn that case you should install gparted by running sudo apt-get install gparted. Then gparted & to run it. \n\nA: You are in a bit of a bind: Your root partition is only ~8GB, so making space in it is hard. What I suggest is that you set up a temporary mount from a folder in your home directory to /var/cache/apt/archives/, so that the space in your home directory partition is available for apt:\nmkdir ~/tmp\nsudo mount -o bind ~/tmp /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nThis should give apt plenty of room.\n", "Q: Accessing Applications Color me stupid, but I've read and tried to execute the suggestions here for this issue and have failed. \nAll I want to do is find and then execute the applications available, the ones I see are already installed.

As it's an university, 99% of the time (if not 100%) it will be used by students. There is not a central database of user accounts and credentials, so each PC will have only two accounts, admin and guest, with the latter configured to autologin (besides some customization as per this tutorial).\nWhen the PCs are turned on, and the guest account logs in automaticcaly, the first thing shown after the window manager is loaded is this dialog box:\n\nHowever, there's two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The very first person who sits at the computer at 9am will see the dialog box, click OK, use the PC, leave, not ending the session or locking the screen (because users), and the second user onwards won't see the message\n\n*There is more relevant information that I'd like to convey for the lab users (lab rules, etc).\n\n\nSo, with this scenario in mind, what I want to achieve is having a dialog box really similar to this one (but with a different text, set by me) to popup whenever a computer isn't used for, say, 15 minutes. (For the purpose of this question, let's assume \"not used\" means no keyboard or mouse activity).\nI have been directed to \nHow does ubuntu determine inactivity before suspending?\n and \nHow can a script detect a user's idle time?\n and use ruby or sheel scripts, but I don't know how to code.\nIs there a simpler way to achieve what I need?\n\nA: Use xautolock\nxautolock -time 15 -locker notify-send -t time \"Title\" \"message_here\" -i \"path/to/icon\"\n\nor use zenity or any dialog you wish.\nSee http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/xautolock.1.html \nEdit: After the edit to the question, the OP went with zenity\nxautolock -time 15 -locker \"zenity --text='<text here>' --warning\"\n\n\nA: If you run the following script in the background, it will check the idle-time every 5 seconds.

Save it as set_warning.py\n\n*Run it by the command\npython3 /path/to/set_warning.py\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*For convenience reasons (and to have control over the text layout),\nthe text is taken from an external textfile. Returns etc. will be\ncopied exactly from the text file into your message. Since the\n--no-wrap option from zenity is used, you need to use the\nreturns, or otherwise your message will be excessively broad.\n\n*The way the message appears can be \"tweaked\" with other zenity options.        \n\n\nA: Here's what I ended up doing:\nxautolock -time 15 -locker \"zenity --text='<text here>' --warning\"\n\nI added that line as an entry on the session apps of the account that is soft linked to /etc/guest-session/skel, so it will run every time the guest session starts.\n", "Q: Changing the applications launched by special keyboard buttons I'm running 14.04 with Cinnamon.

The update manager in my 12.04 installation offered me the upgrade to 14.04 which I decided to do. So I clicked on the link and all seemed well for almost 3 hours. During the 'Upgrade packages' stage my system crashed and powered off without shutting down.\nI have tried everything I can think off to get back in to my Ubuntu system including the dpkg recovery for the new version, boot to old version, dpkg recovery for the old version, and even using my original dvd that I saved the image onto for the first install of 12.04. Nothing is giving me access to my system so that I can repair it and get back to work though.\nIs there a page somewhere in the help pages that I have missed on what my next steps should be? If I created a bootable usb drive copy of 14.04 would that help, and if so how can I do this?\nAt The moment I cannot access any of my data which I need to run my business and this is stopping me from working, costing me customers, and money is pouring down the drain. Please help soon as I am desperate.\n\nA: To attempt to complete the upgrade\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode\n\n*Select the network option. Once that's done press enter to return to the recovery menu.\n\n*Select the dpkg option. Again, when it's done press enter to return to the recovery menu.\n\n*Select the root option and type in do-release-upgrade and then apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n*Reboot : sudo reboot\nTo backup your data\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a live cd\n\n*Open gparted either via the command-line :sudo gparted & or from the dash.\n\n*Figure out the name of your Ubuntu partition. (Should be in the format /dev/sdXY where X is a letter and Y is the partition number)\n\n*For the rest of this post, replace /dev/sdXY with whatever you found out in the previous step.\n\n*Mount the partition in /mnt/ : sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/\n\n*If you're comfortable using the terminal, you can use the cp and mv commands to backup your data. Otherwise, proceed to step 7.\n\n*Run : nautilus /mnt/home/*/ . This will open up every user's home directory in a different window.\n\n*Now you can backup your files to wherever.\n\n\nA: Thanks to all for your help. After following the steps laid out by @pranav I eventually figured out that the root of the problem was a package called 'ncurses-base' which dpkg was reporting as 'to inconsistent to configure'. I am guessing that this may be what caused the original upgrade process to crash.\nI managed to borrow a copy of a linux based 'Kaspersky recovery disk' which ran from the cd but gave me a live file system, as the original installation disk only booted to a trial version which did not permit permanent changes and thus I could not copy my data to another drive. So I downloaded the Ubuntu 14.04 image and burnt it to disk. I then copied all of my data to an external drive.\nThen in the install process I opted to erase the existing version and replace it.\nThe install went smoothly and although I have to install all the packages I was using again that is just a mater of time and all solved.\nOnce again thank you all for your help.\n", "Q: How to solve problem with repositories and update information is outdated message 14.04 I am still new to linux and currently using 14.04 and not sure what to do to solve this situation.

The background story:\nThe other day my (L)ubuntu offered me to upgrade from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS, which I gladly accepted. At the end of the evening, I started the update out of the update manager, got up and went to bed, not noticing that the laptop's power was due to run out apparantly before the update had finished. After swearing loudly the next day because the PC wouldn't boot, I downloaded a Lubuntu 14.04 LTS live CD, booted from that, backed up my complete personal folder (inluding the hidden files/folders) (excluding the 39 Gigs of ~/Music I had safe on my other PC) and reinstalled Lubuntu 14.04 from scratch.\nAfter the reinstallation, I installed quite a few programs I knew I would need/want (Skype, Mumble, PCSX, VLC and LibreOffice, just to name a few), and twiddled with a few of the system settings to create a nicer looking system. Today, I recopied the entirety of my personal folder back onto that laptop to (hopefully) restore all settings, save a few folders/files which sounded like I wouldn't need them. Logged off, tried logging back on, and my desktop is empty.\nYes, it's literally an empty desktop. No files (there should be two), standard background, no panel thingy (what I would call task bar in Windows). There's a mouse I can move. If I right-click on the background, I get a menu out of which I can open a console. (Out of the console I can open pretty much everything I've tried so far, but it's kinda … unintuitive ;)) Even though the right-click menu offers 'System -> Desktop settings', no desktop settings window will physically open.\nI have a little script that should change the desktop background once every 30 mins. Attempting to start that script results in an error message saying the desktop is not active.\nWhich prompts my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which (required) file(s) and/or folder(s) have I most likely overwritten (and probably rendered unuseable?) when porting the complete user folder onto the newer version?\n\n*How can I get a working desktop back?\n\n*Are there any other hidden traps I might stuble into in the near future?\nThanks for your help and apologies if there are answers around here somewhere that I was too stupid to find!\n\nA: I never had problems with backing up and restoring a working home directory (with the same uid/gid) to the same or another machine.

Ubuntu does not run Internet Explorer, but has several other browsers available to access the internet.  Common ones include Firefox and Chromium, and Google Chrome.\nLook for an Icon on the desktop that looks like a blue circle with an orange fox wrapped around the bottom - this is Firefox.  You can use it to access the internet.  Alternatively, press the 'special' key on your keyboard (probably looks like a windowpane) and type firefox, which will cause your computer to search for firefox.\nThe default icons for various browser on Ubuntu include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox \n\n*Chromium\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu in Windows 8 OEM System when USB is not detected Ok... So I trying to dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit and Windows 8.1 Asus OEM on my laptop, and it DOES have UEFI BIOS. So, in accordance with the instructions, I disabled Fast Startup, SecureBoot, but I do not believe Legacy Boot is an option in my BIOS (I will double check with Asus support). So after I did that, I used UNETBOOTIN to burn a 14.04 64 bit ISO image onto an 8 GB Flash Drive via the USB 3 port (have also tried USB 2.0). I go into Advanced Startup options from in windows and choose boot a device, but the only option there is \"ubuntu\" from my previous failed installation (which I later removed). The USB does not appear in that menu, nor in BIOS in the Boot Order Menu (only the ubuntu entry again), and I am not sure what to do. My old laptop also does not boot off USB anymore, so must I go with VirtualBox? Thank you all!\n\nA: Don't use unetbootin. I've seen many reports of similar problems when people try to use it. Instead, if you've got an existing Linux (or OS X) installation, use dd to copy the image to the USB drive, as in:\nsudo dd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nThis example assumes that /dev/sdc is your USB flash drive; change that detail appropriately, along with the filename for the image file.\nThere are dd ports to Windows; or you could use Rufus, which seems to do a better job at creating EFI-bootable images.\n", "Q: sshd and openssh server installation I'm new to Ubuntu.

I don't understand why. You don't need to login to access the samba share. Just need to be on the network. The share is mounted at /media/Network on the server computer.\nHere's the error I get when I try deleting/moving a file:\n\nsmb.conf:\n[Network]\n    path = /media/Network\n    writeable = yes\n;   browseable = yes\n    force user = cody\n    guest ok = yes\n\nPermissions: (ls -la /media/Network) (The red covered things are user folders I created)\n\n\nA: The permissions listed here don't allow the user cody to write at Linux level but well to read.\nSo if you force Samba to use this Linux user when accessing the share (force user = cody), you won't be able to write either from Windows.\nEvreything is owned by root from /media/Network with write access only allowed to the user owning the directory or the file, in this case root.\nSo what you have to do is to switch the owner of the files and directories starting with and below /media/Network to have a write access from Windows.\nsudo chown -R cody /media/Network\n\nWhen setting up Samba, you don't have to forgot that the read and write access coming from a Windows PC are to be translated by the smbd daemon of Samba into Linux read and write, using a valid Linux user and subject to the underlaying Linux filesystem permissions.\nIn your Samba configuration extract, you tell Samba to use the Linux user cody to access the directories and files under /media/Network. Forgetting about the Windows username that is passed in the connection between Windows and Samba.\n", "Q: If I backup my Ubuntu (unity) using Deja, can I restore it when I use a fresh install of UbuntuGNOME? This may be a weird question, but it has me stumped and google is little help. I am currently running Ubuntu with the default Unity interface. I've been wanting to experiment with different DE's for a while now and have finally been convinced to just use UbuntuGNOME instead of juggling Unity and Gnome as this has caused issues in the past. My question is, if I'm backing up my system now using the default backup app Deja Dup (on Unity), can I restore it once I have UbuntuGNOME (simply so I can get my personal files back from my home folder- music, pics, etc.) or do I have to back those files up independently of the backup files because of compatibility issues? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Yes, Deja Dup uses Duplicity as its backend. \nIt's desktop agnostic; duplicity doesn't care what desktop you use. \n", "Q: Black Screen + No Install I tried to install ubuntu... but when I booted the disc the computer said it wasn't bootable,It said Please insert bootable media. how can I fix this?\n\nA: How did you mount the disk?\nDid you just place the .iso onto it, or did you actually mount it?\nIf you haven't mounted it that explains the issue you are having. Best way to mount onto a cd on windows 7 is to install the free software Infra Recorder from http://infrarecorder.org/ and then burn the .iso onto it through; actions -> burn image (in the menu).\nNow you can boot from the CD.

I've completely erased netatalk with apt-get remove --purge netatalk and re-installed it, as well as rebooting the server multiple times, with the same errors displayed. Also, SMB shares still work fine, but obviously SMB won't work for Time Machine backups. \n\nA: It's a bug in libpam-smbpass.

This also includes the icons.\nSince you've installed KDE/Kubuntu, this by default does not include the Gnome icon-sets - different code-base, different organisation.\nThus, to ensure a gnome-based application such as Rhythmbox looks and feels as the Gnome developers envisaged, you'll need to install their required packages.\nTo install the main icon-sets for Gnome-based application such as Rhythmbox will require you to install the following packages:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-icon-theme, gnome-icon-theme-symbolic\n\nIf you intend to install more of the obscure Gnome based applications available, gnome-icon-theme-extras will also be required.\n", "Q: Force format USB Maybe you can help me but I'm becoming very doubtful. But I have a Verbatim flash drive (third Verbatim flash drive to do this to be exact and one sandisk all the same problem over the past year) But using them between Windows machines and Linux machines switching between the two they eventually be come corrupt and no amount of software can fix them that I have found and the more I try to format them whether on windows or linux they just keep getting more and more errors each time till I give up. \nAny way I will just tell you my problems from the one that messed up last night. I reinstalled windows on a customers computer so I backed up the drivers to the the USB stick and transferred them to my ubuntu desktop and then used Ubuntu to make the USB bootable to install windows and it went flawless. However I reformatted the drive and slid the drivers for windows back on it appeared to have worked only some of the files weren't making it to the usb drive tried like 10 times each time different files were missing even though Ubuntu said it was successful. I formatted the drive multiple times during the process and eventually the flash drive started getting errors on both computers. Windows kept saying it couldn't read it and needed to format it and Ubuntu kept getting all kinds of errors under gparted. Anyway I've tried dd, disk utility, gparted, fsck. At this point it is so bad it don't matter what I try or what command I use it always comes back as read-only and it wont do anything to it. I don't currently have access to a windows machine I have a windows 7 virtual machine but it crashes as soon as I plug in the drive. \n\nA: I had an issue similar to this with a 4GB Verbatim USB which, funnily enough, is sitting right next to me as I type this with Windows 7.iso mounted on it.\nThe program I used to fix it is a very small, compact yet extremely fast and powerful software from http://rufus.akeo.ie/\nThe program is called Rufus and it can mount .iso's for Windows, Ubuntu and I believe Os x too.\nBasically, install the software, plug your USB in and choose a format etc. (the .iso locator is \nthe small button next to the .iso text) and then with the size, make sure you choose how ever many GB's your USB is.\nGive it a shot and see how it goes, worked for me.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a thumb drive that would not show up.  I tried gparted several times after the startuup disk program would not write to the drive.  /what I finally found using gparted, if using the drop down under devise, Create a new partition, make sure you are on the correct drive,  in my case that was SBD,  nothing seems to happen, so I tried again, only to have nothing seem to happen. so I went to the next drop down which I had also tried before. That menu is partition, now when I went to create a new partition, I was easily able to make an MSDOS partition. Then the startup program worked perfectly.   I have not tried some thing esle yuet but I'm betting that now that I have an DOS partition I can convert it to an ext.  Just my experience. I realize this thread is several years old, but I did not see that there had been a resolution. I hope this helps some one with the same issue from haveing to go out and spend $8 and extra time on a new thumb drive. \n", "Q: Looking for text BBS software I would like to know if there are text-based, bulleting board system forum servers for Ubuntu.

I suspect you tried to connect to the VM instead of host.\nIn your RDP client, you must enter:\ndedicated_host_name_or_IP:RDP_port_number_of_the_VM\nfor instance:\nlocalhost:5001 # if I connect a VM running on my Virtual Box server.\n192.168.1.25:5000 # IP adress of my dedicated server not of the VM.\nEdit\nThere are two ways to use RDP on your VMs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the host machine as the RDP server. It works only if you activate the \"Remote Display\" server in your VMs setting (chapter Display). Using this will work even if your VM network configuration is incorrect.\n\n*Using the VM itself as RDP server (I suspect it's what your trying to do). Then, you have to configure the TCP/IP options in the VM, not only the Virtual Box settings. Maybe you use the default DHCP option there. If this don't work with the bridged adapter setting (and works with the NAT), try this:\n\n\nIn the VB settings, make sure your bridged adapter is linked to your main interface (the one giving access to Internet to the VB host). Open the \"Advanced options\" and enable \"Cable connected\".\nIn the TCP/IP settings of the VM, choose DHCP. Restart the connection if needed.\nIf this don't work, open a terminal in the VM and type ipconfig to know if your VM got a working IP address.\n", "Q: Stuttering screens on 14.04 on MacPro A friend gave me an old MacPro and installed 14.04 on it.

So I don't know why is that and I don't know how to fix it. If anyone can help me with this I really appreciate.\nThanx........ \n\nA: compiz-fusion-plugins-extra is an old transitional dummy package from Ubuntu 12.04, and there is no package by the name of compiz-fusion in the Ubuntu Software Center for Ubuntu 14.04. There is however Compiz (compiz-core) which is installed by default in Ubuntu 14.04. If you could provide any more information on what it is you're trying to do with compiz-fusion then it would help to find what specific packages for that purpose are available in the Ubuntu Software Center for Ubuntu 14.04 (for example, compiz-plugins). When you install a package from the Ubuntu Software Center, it resolves all the package's dependencies for you, so that you don't get any error message like you got when trying to install compiz-fusion. \nin order to add different wallpapers for different workspaces in Ubuntu 14.04 you need to install three packages from the Ubuntu Software Center - compiz-plugins, compizconfig-settings-manager and dconf-tools - and then follow the instructions from the answer by fossfreedom to the question: Is it possible to have a different background for each workspace?. Find the section of the answer called: Ubuntu 13.04, 13.10 and 14.04 and then follow the step-by-step instructions as shown in the screenshots. Maybe you got the error message because you were trying to follow the instructions for Ubuntu 12.04 instead of for Ubuntu 14.04. If so, I have corrected that by giving you the second link to the instructions for Ubuntu 14.04.\n", "Q: Wacom tablet removed after sleep mode The tablet functionality stops working after I wake my Lenovo Tablet from sleep mode (closing & opening lit).

In the system settings under input devices it states that \"No tablet device is detected\". Only a restart helps and the touch screen works again.\nThis error appeared only after upgrading from Kubuntu 12.04 to 14.04. In 12.04 the same error message appeared after waking from sleep mode, but then another followed that the tablet was activated again and it worked properly. Any ideas how this could be fixed?\n\nA: Finally, I found a convenient solution! It is indeed some bug in (K)ubuntu 14.04 which affects many tablet PC users. The bug has been filed as Launchpad Bug #1275416.\nA number of workaround solutions are suggested there. The solution offered in this answer by Rmano is not far off, but the suggested script just doesn't work in my case. (I'm using a Lenovo ThinkPad X201 Tablet.)\nThe script from post no. 21 of the bug report, plus the command from post no. 22, however, works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_x200-wacom-workaround with this content:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nreenable_touch()\n{\n  for idfile in /sys/class/tty/ttyS*/device/id; do\n    if test -f $idfile; then\n      if grep -q '^WACf00c$' $idfile; then\n        devicefile=`echo \"$idfile\" | \\\n          sed -n \\\n            's/^\\/sys\\/class\\/tty\\/ttyS\\([0-9]\\+\\)\\/.*$/\\/dev\\/ttyS\\1/p'`\n        if test -n $devicefile; then\n          inputattach --daemon -w8001 $devicefile\n          break\n        fi\n      fi\n    fi\n  done\n}\n\ncase $1 in\n  resume|thaw)\n    reenable_touch\n    ;;\nesac\n\n\n*Make that file executable to ensure it can run on resume:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_x200-wacom-workaround\n\nAfter waking from sleep mode, the notification that the Wacom tablet is removed is now followed right after by another notification saying that the Wacom tablet is reactivated  … exactly how it used to be in (K)ubuntu 12.04 as well. Problem solved.\n\nA: During the suspend and resume phases, Ubuntu (really every Linux system using pm-utils) executes a series of scripts located in the directory /etc/pm/sleep.d/; they are executed in alphabetic order --- from 0..9A..Z during suspend, and the other way around during resume. Conventionally all scripts start with a number (00,01,02...) and there is also a conventional meaning to the numbering. More info on  the really well made page on Arch Linux doc site. Scripts are called with an argument that can be \"suspend\", \"resume\", \"hibernate\", \"thaw\" so they can know why they are called. \nSo if you want to unload and reload the wacom module at suspend and resume, respectively, you can add a script --- for example, /etc/pm/sleep.d/04_myscript with the content: \n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n        resume|thaw)\n            modprobe wacom\n        ;;\n        suspend|hibernate)\n            rmmod wacom\n        ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n\nAnd remember to make the script executable and readable by root, with \nchmod 755 /etc/pm/sleep.d/04_myscript\n\nCaveats: \n\n\n*\n\n*all of the above must be done as root; so to edit the script and to change its permission you have to add the appropriate sudo. \n\n*this is really a hack --- unloading and reloading the module can confuse applications. For example, it will definitely confuse xournal that would not be able to see the touchscreen after tat unless you restart it. \n", "Q: How to get into GRUB on Presario CQ43 hp laptop to change root password without cd drive?

After it has opened about 3-4, or after it has been running for a while, other programs will refuse to launch (even if all the current programs are closed. After closing they won't reopen.) Trying to launch them will sometimes result in a loading icon on the cursor, and other times, nothing. Strangely, this doesn't seem to affect synaptic package manager or nautilus, but does affect the terminal - which I have strong negative feelings about. It's a pain because I can't check to see if opening them from terminal will work.\nI can switch programs by restarting my computer, but obviously this isn't an ideal solution. I should also mention I have a dual-boot, in case this has to do with memory.\nIs this a known problem? Are other people experiencing it now?\n\nA: Alright, I stopped being useless and fixed the problem (kinda).\nAttempts to open things via terminal gave an error stating \"Maximum number of clients reached\". It's a problem with X. I googled around and found this thread: How can I diagnose/debug \"maximum number of clients reached\" X errors? where someone had trouble with a wallpaper changer.

I want to use this system mainly for work (software developement for embedded systems, android and web development) and also for entertainment. \nMy question is, what would be the ideal distributing of Linux folders for example /home /etc /temp in this situation? With the focus of getting the maximum out of the SSD drive so booting up and routine works be fast.please let me know what do you suggest?\n\nA: For quick booting, you would want it to boot from the SSD. \nUsually /boot is 300 to 500MB, put this on the SSD at the beginning. I normally suggest / (root) of 20 or 25GB also on the SSD (After the /boot). Now you can add /home or data partition(s) onto the 2TB drive.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Slightly different suggestion. Not necessarily better. Each user has to decide how he will use system.\nI prefer to have / (root) on SSD but not a separate /boot or any other system partitions. And I leave /home inside root so the user settings are also on the faster drive. But then create data partition(s) on rotating drive for all data and link data back to /home so it looks like it all is in /home.\nMy 64GB SSD has two / installs, one 12.04, and 14.04 each half of SSD, I will probably overwrite 12.04 when 16.04 is released. I also keep all data on hard drive but also have test installs (at least one reasonably current) so hard drive could be booted in an emergency if issues with SSD. Each test install is 20 or 25GB and I link in the data partitions, so everything is otherwise configured the same.\n", "Q: Hide and Unhide Folders Permanently In my local drive for a folder,when i add '.' followed by the folder name, and press ctrl+H, the folder gets invisible, but once if i close that drive and open it again the hidden files are automatically visible without pressing ctrl+H.

I use Ubuntu on a daily basis and want to try Suse on my second laptop. \nNeither Startup Disk Creator (both versions on the Ubuntu Universe) nor unetbootin allow me to use anything different than another Ubuntu distro to create the live USB key. \nI don't use windows anymore, so doing this on a pc is not an option.\nIs there any other way / application?\n\nA: If the .iso is a \"hybrid mode\" image (like most Ubuntu and Debian images these days, have no idea about SUSE), then you can just write it directly to the USB just as if it was a CD-ROM drive.  For instance, using dd.\ndd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc oflag=direct bs=1048576\n\nIf the .iso is not a hybrid mode image, then you can use UNetBootin, available from Ubuntu's repositories, which is an easy way to burn an ISO (for a Linux distro) to a USB key.\nUNetBootin does not restrict you to using it with Ubuntu only - it will allow you to use an .iso you have previously downloaded, and that .iso can be of any distro.\n\nA: Download live ISO for gnome or kde from here.\nYou can use MultiSystem(tutorial and download link here)just an alternative, but you can also use unetbootin for SUSE.\n", "Q: Laptop doesn't suspend My laptop is Lenova T530 and I use Ubuntu 13.10.

I was able to have the dual boot of the system. GRUB menu works fine, i.e. it shows both Ubuntu and Windows Boot Manager, and the corresponding OS can be booted up properly. But, if I choose Windows 8.1 to boot, and restart the PC after that, GRUB menu does not show up anymore and the PC boots directly to Windows. I found, from my BIOS setup, the boot order shows Windows Boot Manager is on the top although I changed Ubuntu on the top before. I have to put Ubuntu on the top again in order for GRUB menu to appear again. But, next time, if I go to Windows, and restart the PC, the boot order is restored back to Windows on the top and no Grub menu shows up. How can I make the boot order in BIOS does not change? I have already disabled the secure boot and fastboot, and make the system support legacy boot. But, it does not help. I guess the issue is on Windows 8.1 somehow reorders the boot order (put itself on top) once I boot into Windows 8.1. \n\nA: A possible solution, is the one boot-repair uses, which is to rename the windows bootloader to a backup name, and copy in the ubuntu bootloader (grubx64.efi , unsigned, without secure boot) in place of the /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.  Windows tends to rewrite the boot order, no fix for that.  You should stay in UEFI mode to continue to boot Windows with Ubuntu.\n\nEvery machine is different, but on my Toshiba Windows will sometimes rewrite the order.  I am in the habit of using a function key to invoke the EFI menu, select the HDD, then select ubuntu to boot.  I have an Asus on which I cannot even keep the USB first in boot order, even without booting Windows, so things  could be worse.  Once you get the fake bootmgfw.efi in place, things should be stable for you.\n", "Q: Does the Magic SysRq Key Always Work?

In the Displays section of the settings, Unity has an option to set \"Scale for menu and title bars\". This option is presented as a slider with notches every .125. However, I find that the optimal scaling factor for my display would be between two of these notches. How can I change it to something like 2.06 or 1.85?\n\nA: Short answer: Not possible. This is just not supported. Maybe a future version of Ubuntu will offer more fine-grained control, but for now at least you will have to do with the values that are there.\nLong answer: I very recently answered a similar question here: How do I get the value of Display -> \"Scale for menu and title bars:\" from the command line?\nEssentially, the scaling factor is stored as a dconf setting. Run\ndconf read /com/ubuntu/user-interface/scale-factor\n\nto see what the current scaling factor is. For me this gives\n{'LVDS1': 8, 'HDMI3': 8}\n\n...where LVDS1 is my laptop display and HDMI3 is my monitor connected via the docking station (you can set different scaling factors in setups with multiple displays).\nThe value displayed as the Scale for menu and title bars in System Settings -> Displays is 1/8 of the dconf value of the corresponding display. So the above output means that the scaling factors for both of my displays are 1.\nYou could change this dconf value manually (using dconf write, see my other answer), however it must be an integer, and any integer lower than 4 or higher than 16 will confuse the system. Therefore you can only set it to values 4, 5, 6, ..., 16, which corresponds to scaling factors 4/8=.5, 5/8=.625, 6/8=.75, ..., 16/8=2. Those are the .125 steps you were seeing.\n", "Q: How to setup ssl (https) for your site on Ubuntu Linux - Two way SSL I have a website, the main requirement is to make that website secure by using https  \nWhen the client access from a different machine it has to work only if the certificate had uploaded in the browser settings. \nIf not it should deny the access to that website.

To be loaded automatically by your server, you have to remove the password :\nopenssl rsa -in server.pass.key -out server.key\n\nYou have now a valid server private key in a file, this is the file pointed by the SSLCertificateKeyFile Apache directive.\nFrom this private key, you will create a Certificate Signed Request (CSR) :\nopenssl req -nodes -new -key server.key -out server.csr\n\nYou are going to be prompted to enter a set of elements (country, organization, ...). The most important one will be the Common Name (CN), it must match the hostname of your webserver, the one used in the URL. So in my example it is www.example.com.\nThen, you have to submit this CSR file to your certificate provider. Any public CA is good. After they've approved your requested, they will send you the famous X.509 certificate file for your server. This file will be pointed by the SSLCertificateFile Apache's directive.\nFor the client\nYou will have to provide valid certificate to the client too.\nBased on the client type (Linux, Windows, MAC, ...) the process may differ. \nSometimes, for the client certificates, all the operation can be done directly from the web browser by visiting the page of the CA registration.

Most I have met would trade immediate family members to keep the tools and workflow that they are used to.\nI think it is very easy to under-appreciate how people use their tools, especially in a creative setting. If you have an idea and you need to get that \"onto paper\" as soon as possible, the very last thing you want to do is spend minutes hunting around, or worse yet, finding that what you'd like to do is unavailable.\nPerhaps it's easier to understand the other way around. Imagine a series of mega-viruses made Linux (and the GNU tools) a non-viable platform. You'd fight for it still because —if you're anything like me— you'd be completely useless back on Windows.\nAs an implementer, you have dependants and a company that relies on their output (both quality and rate). You have to look at the bigger picture and factor it all in. You still have a few viable options though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Train them on new tools. GIMP and InkScape are both great but there isn't feature parity and a great deal of features are in different places and work in different ways. It's not inconceivable that you could run a design shop on free tools though.\nNote: Historical work might not be compatible with GIMP. This could cause serious issues.\n\n*Old tools through virtualisation. There are a number of ways to use Ubuntu as the main OS but use Windows-only tools like Photoshop.\nI use a network-unaware XP install in VirtualBox with shared folders and that works well for me. Provided you have the licenses of Windows to support this, you could share the same sort of image over the network and have it scrub itself between boots. You could even use a kiosk mode to make the box only good for Photoshop.\nBut there are things like XenApp where you can run applications on a central Windows server out to any platform clients... But you'd be buying into an infrastructure change too.\n\n*Old tools, better platform. OSX can run the Adobe Creative Suite and most would agree it shares a fair amount of the technical benefits that Ubuntu does. It's still different so might still upset the designers but it's also fancy and swish, so that might impress them.\n\n*Old tools, old platform.

So I am here to ask which is the safest migration path.\nA quick list:\nls /etc/apt/sources.list.d\nnginx-stable-precise.list\nnginx-stable-precise.list.save\nondrej-mysql-experimental-precise.list\nondrej-mysql-experimental-precise.list.save\nondrej-php5-precise.list\nondrej-php5-precise.list.save\n\nConsidering I see \"precise\" in the above listing, do I have to do something particular in order to have those PPAs switched over to their \"trusty\" version? Or shall Ubuntu be so smart to detect that and deal with it? I have checked and all those PPAs have a corresponding \"trusty\" distro version available.\nOr, do I have to manually remove the PPA references in apt, upgrade to 14.04 and then add the PPAs again?\nWhat I am asking is really a checklist about what to do before and after the upgrade in order to not break anything.\nFinally, what if I wanted to stop using the PPA version of say nginx and just use the 14.04 bundled native nginx? Do I just remove the PPA reference before the upgrade or what?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: When you start a release upgrade, the upgrade tool disables all PPAs (it comments out the source lines from these files). You will have to manually enable them after the upgrade, either by editing the files and uncommenting the lines, or using the Software Sources tool. In either case, you will have to change the entry from precise to trusty yourself. So if you wish to stop using the PPA version for some PPA, don't do anything, just upgrade. :)\nIf existing packages have an upgrade path, they will get updated (so nginx will be upgraded to whatever version is available for 14.04), irrespective of where they came from. If existing packages have no installation candidate in the new release, and don't conflict with anything else, they are left as is.  If you use something like Synaptic or Aptitude, these will show up as local or obsolete packages.\n", "Q: How to delete a file from the opening dialogue of LibreOffice?

This gives me a much smooth range of volumes, all the way down to zero percent. I can actually get it down to a level that is barely perceptible to me (~-60dB).\nAnd of course recording still works. So all good!\nNote that before switching to Pro Audio mode, it might be better to put the ALSA mixer volume to its maximum, as that will be the 100% mark in Pulseaudio/PipeWire after... In my first experiments, the 100% volume was quite not loud enough.

In contrast to the normal installer, the alternate installer did not fail at the beginning, so one could manually ask the installer not to mount the existing partitions and to use the whole disk for Lubuntu.  \nHowever, now, two other problems came up: the newly installed system cannot be shut-down probably (see Lubuntu: neither shut-down nor restart works) and does not recognise USB sticks (same problem as in USB recognized but not available?). Both problems did not occur using the installation CD as live CD.\nTherefore, I wanted to try the \"normal\" installation CD again, but it fails with the same error message as it did before:\nThe installer encountered an unrecoverable error. A desktop session will now be run so that you may investigate the problem or try installing again.\n\nOnce being in that desktop session, tail -n 800 -F /var/log/kern.log lists the following (sorry for being long; I do not know what might be important): see https://www.dropbox.com/s/uohd7vmq1ws9oep/Output.txt?dl=0\nThe content of /var/log/installer from...\n\n\n*\n\n*...installation with alternate installer: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qv7o8w6t5s31xzk/AADmkNP1KP1IaMKOxRfsclRAa?dl=0\n\n*...unsuccessful installation with usual installer: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dhon6asbz1swms5/AACc3WtvvpIH34_WqA3u3p18a?dl=0\n\nA: This looks like a bug, upowerd is hanging for some reason. There is a similar but unanswered report on the Ubuntu forums here and Mint forums here (the suggested reason there is something to do with reporting the battery status: \"at present my system will not show me charge status\")\nI would suggest reporting the bug on Launchpad and possibly on the upower mailing list. It does seem a rare bug though, so there may be no solution unless you are willing to debug it yourself.\n\nYou might be able to workaround the problem by sudo to root and then edit /usr/lib/ubiquity/ubiquity/upower.py and change the has_battery function to:\ndef has_battery():\n    return False\n\nThat should force ubiquity to ignore the battery power and carry on with the installation.\n", "Q: Web-server on Azure I installed an Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS Virtual MAchine on Azure.\nI want to set it up as a WebServer with email capabilities, too.\nHow can I install software packages through the command line?

For instance, searching for all instance of apache in the list of software, you will do apt-cache search apache.\nWhen you have identified the name of the package(s) you need, you will do sudo apt-get install <package name>.\nThe apt-get command retrieve the name of all the dependent packages and will install them along with the package you have requested.\nThere are alternative to apt-get.\nThe one I like, is tasksel. Install it by typing sudo apt-get tasksel.\ntasksel can be used to install all the packages related to a given functionality. Not only the dependencies, but also nice-to-have tools to create for instance a LAMP server and so on.\nsudo tasksel install lamp-server\nsudo tasksel install mail-server\n\nwill install all the required packages that will create a full-featured mail and LAMP server.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Trusty - corresponding Debian release?

I recall this dialog in older versions of Ubuntu providing more options, like this:\n\nBut these options are never provided to me.

Two options are of interest, default-cache-ttl is the time after using the key until it gets locked, max-cache-ttl is the time after unlocking the key.\nman gpg-agent does not describe whether a max-cache-ttl value of 0 disables caching completely (as it invalidates instantly) or disables invalidation, but you will be able to realize easily.

I am going to install 14.04LTS and I am wondering what are the pros and cons of an encrypted Ubuntu installation?\nI assume pros are to do with security but I would appreciate finding out how much different it is from an un-encrypted install.\nCons I was thinking would it affect the computers performance level but interested would this be noticeable in everyday use.\nComputer you mostly be used for browsing, some downloading, LaTeX, and a little gaming (steam).\nSome basic spec on my computer are, Intel Haswell i3 2.6ghz chip, 4gb Ram, 120gb mSata SSD(also have a 1tb HDD that I'll use for data).\n\nA: You will have two options to Chose when you are going through the install\n\n\n*\n\n*You can encrypt the entire drive and at boot it will require a password at each boot in order to work and will then proceed to boot normally. this is the most secure way to lock down your PC\n\n*you can just encrypt your Home folder where you store documents and pictures and other files. When you login, your home folder is decrypted and you can use it as normal.\nI have used both and didn't see much of a performance decrease from ether. Now something to keep in mind is how to recover your info in case your motherboard died and you need to get the info of the drive. \nI know for the home folder encryption Ubuntu will help you set it up once the system is installed and will give you a recovery key to use in this case but i'm not sure about the full hard drive encryption which may not have the ability.\n", "Q: What editor provides highlighted and clickable hyperlinks? (similar to Notepad++) I have about a 1000 links in my txt file and I don't want to copy paste them in my browser.\nSo I am looking for a text editor that highlights URLs and makes them clickable.Please note that I am looking for a text editor (like kate, sublime) and not a full IDE.\nI have tried Sublime, Kate, gedit etc, but I can't figure how to highlight URLs and hyperlinks there\n\nA: It's too simple, just Open Terminal by using Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\n\n    cat -n /File_Path/File_Name\n\nWith -n option you could see the line numbers of a file \"File_Name\" in the output terminal for easy to understand which line you clicked last time. \nIf file having large number of contains (like yours) that won't fit in output terminal and screen scrolls up very fast, we can use parameters more or less with cat command as show below.\n\n    cat -n /File_Path/File_Name | less\n\nor\n\n    cat -n /File_Path/File_Name | more\n\nThen you need to hold the Ctrl key down while left clicking to open links in a browser, or right click and select the context menu option \"Open Link\". enjoy\n\nA: In Emacs's org-mode the URLs are highlighted.\n\nA: There's a Sublime plugin for this. From the Github description:\n\n\nThis plugin underlines URLs in Sublime Text, and lets you open them with a keystroke (Cmd+Option+Enter by default).\nAfter you put the cursor over an URL, you can either hit Cmd+Option+Enter (Ctrl+Alt+Enter on Windows & Linux), or select \"Open URL under cursor\" from the Command Palette. Instead of selecting an auto detected URL, you can select any block of text and it will also open in a browser as a URL.\n\nHowever, this plugin might not be the right choice for thousands of URLs:\n\nPerformance warning. The plugin is automatically disabled if the document has more than 200 URLs, in order to avoid a massive performance hit.\n\nAs with most Sublime plugins you can install Clickable URLs via Package Control.\n\nA: Now Notepad++ (with ability to click by links) can be installed on Ubuntu from snap.\n    sudo apt install snapd snapd-xdg-open\n    sudo snap install notepad-plus-plus\n\nHow to Install Notepad++ Editor on Ubuntu\nHowever Notepad++ does not have official support for Linux (and Ubuntu).\nAnd there is problem with copy-pasting from Notepad++ to Terminal. But workaround is very simple. To past from Notepad++ to Terminal, Ctl+Shift+V shortcut can be used instead of Ctl+V and instead of Shift+Insert.\n\nMoved back from Linux to Windows ~12 months ago, hope that memory\nserves. There could be multiple issues.\nIf you are talking about problems of copy-pasting between Notepad++\nand terminal (or other Linux app) then you are likely facing the\nproblem of Linux PRIMARY and SECONDARY paste buffers. Go read about\nit. Notepad++ over wine is copying into SECONDARY buffer and to paste\ninto terminal you need special shortcut: ctrl-shift-v. For the other\nway around copy with ctrl-ins from terminal and paste with ctrl-v into\nNotepad++.\nFrom your description, I assume you are copy-pasting from Notepad++\ninto Notepad++. Don’t remember an issue like you described. I could\nguess that ctrl-ins and shift-ins are global shortcuts in the Linux\nsystem. This may lead into race where 2 entities, Notepad++ and\n“Linux”, manipulate the clipboard (or paste buffers) which leads to\nunpredictable results. Using ctrl-c and ctrl-v should workaround THAT\nissue since they are far less global. If that is indeed the problem\nthen disabling global effects of ctrl-ins shift-ins will be VERY\ndifficult. These shortcuts are embedded deep into the system.\nThere are also helper applications that should do automatic\nsynchronization between PRIMARY and SECONDARY buffers to help. I\ndidn’t install any of them myself. But as many kinds of “help” they\nmay leave you off worse than you started.\n\nUbuntu, copy paste, works half the time\nI tested this on Ubuntu 20.04.\n\nA: What about Featherpad?\n\nFeatherPad (by Pedram Pourang [...]) is a lightweight Qt plain-text editor for Linux.

I want to install the 64bit version of ubuntu 14.04 on my new laptop which you can find here if you want to check its stats.\nMy question is:\nAre there programs in software center which do not work on the 64bit version?\n(I know this question is a duplicate but the similar questions I found are about 2 or 3 years old)\n\nA: Yes, there may be programs in Ubuntu which are not usable on 64-bit. However, generally, it will not be an issue. If you come across an application that is listed in Software Center and comes from Ubuntu, feel free to open a bug on it.\n\nA: TL;DR: If you're talking about just programs offered in the Software Center, and  they are offered for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Ubuntu (which almost all are), then there are probably not any problems causing them to break specifically a 64-bit system.\nOf course it's possible for a program to have a bug that prevents it from working correctly on some particular architecture. As the 64-bit version of Ubuntu is not new, and has not been new for quite some time, there's no reason to think that software provided officially through Ubuntu's official repositories (nor paid software, nor software installed through PPAs) is more likely to have 64-bit specific bugs than 32-bit specific bugs.\nGenerally speaking, anything that is available for your architecture in the Software Center has been tested on your architecture and is pretty strongly believed to work on it.\nHowever, the situation may be different with respect to some third-party software. It's possible some vendors, especially of binary-only software, have spent inadequate time on the 64-bit versions.\nThe thing is, you can install 32-bit software on a 64-bit Ubuntu system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiarch facilitates installing 32-bit packages on a 64-bit system. The 32-bit version of a package packagename can be installed as packagename:i386 in APT:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install packagename:i386\nIt's possible to have conflicts between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the same software. Such conflicts are the norm for programs, but are uncommon for libraries. Since dependencies required to be of the same architecture as the software requiring them are most often libraries, most often such conflicts do not arise.\n\n*If you have binary-only 32-bit software from a third party, it may depend on 32-bit libraries. But you can usually install those libraries (same technique as above) and then install the binary-only 32-bit program on your 64-bit system.\nThe main areas where a 64-bit system might be inadequate where a 32-bit system would work are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your computer is low on RAM. The 64-bit versions of programs (and the libraries on which they depend), as well as the data structures they create, tend to be somewhat larger and thus to cause more RAM usage when running. In practice, for systems with enough physical member, this effect is not usually very great. For systems with only just enough RAM, it can be considerable.\n\n*The software you need to run is not a program but a driver and the driver only has a 32-bit version. Then you might really be out of luck, and may have to use the 32-bit version (since a 32-bit driver requires the 32-bit kernel in almost all cases, and the 32-bit kernel can only run 32-bit programs, preventing any part of a 64-bit OS from being run).\nSince most drivers are free open source software or are otherwise distributed (among other ways) as source code, and because 64-bit systems running the Linux kernel have been around and common for decades now, this is not very likely. But if you have obscure hardware with binary-only proprietary drivers that only come in a 32-bit version, this might demand you run a 32-bit operating system.\nLike programs, drivers can also have bugs, including bugs that selectively affect a particular architecture. Since drivers are often lower-level (i.e., \"closer to the hardware\") than many applications in terms of their implementation, my guess is that architecture-specific bugs are more common in drivers than programs. However, there is still no reason to think such bugs would be more likely to appear on a 64-bit system than on a 32-bit system.\n", "Q: Only a different subnet and a virtual IP for it seems to work out to access my IP-cam My Router IP is 192.168.1.1.

So instead of @daily, one would have to use:\n1 5 btsync-job /home/dm/Devel/btsync && notify-send \"Btsync loaded ...\n\nAside from this, notify-send would need the DISPLAY variable to be set. \nThis is typically :0, but you can check using echo $DISPLAY in a terminal.\nThus the anacrontab entry should look like:\nDISPLAY=:0\n1 5 btsync-job /home/dm/Devel/btsync && notify-send \"Btsync loaded ...\n\n", "Q: IP address problem on 2nd network card I have a network at home with multiple clients, both wired and wifi. All but one of the clients connect to the network with an IP address that is within the range that the router assigns to them. The client not connecting as expected is running 14.04 LTS and have two network cards. The onboard network card is only 100 MBps, so I would like to connect it to the periferal network card with 1000 MBps speed. Oddly enough, that wired connection gives me an IP address of 90.226... something and not 192.168... that the all the other clients get assigned (including the troublesome client, when on the onboard network card). I still get internet access on the client, but no access to the rest of the network.

(PDF here.)\n\n*Debian FAQ:\n\n*\n\n*Package management basics.\n\n*Package management tools.\n\n\n\nA: At a simple level, dpkg checks to see if dependencies/conflicts are met, extracts the files from the .deb file, runs any {pre,post}{inst,rm} scripts (whichever are applicable), and adds a record that the package is installed into its records (which is just a file, I think).\n", "Q: My server freezes after update apache2 server I have a ubuntu server 12.04 with LAMP and ubuntu desktop enviroment.

Where can I see the list of all programs installed in ubuntu ?\nEx: If I want to launch \"terminal\". I need to click the upper left icon and type \"terminal\".

I don't know.\nThanks\n\nA: Most of launchers for programs that appear in menus/launcher/dash  can be found in /usr/share/applications:\n\nthe menu/dash program searches their for launchers. Each user can also have their own launchers in ~/.local/share/applications.\nThe actual files end with the .desktop extension, and have something like the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Firefox\nGenericName=Web Browser\nComment=Browse the Web\nExec=firefox %u\nIcon=firefox\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nMimeType=text/html;text/xml;application/xhtml+xml;application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml;text/mml;x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https;\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=Network;WebBrowser;\nKeywords=web;browser;internet;\nX-Desktop-File-Install-Version=0.21\n\nNote the exec line indicated what command to execute (in /usr/bin or somewhere else in the user's $PATH) - other information is also included, such as the icon to use (by default from /usr/share/icons, also from ~/.local/share/icons), name, category, etc.\nLaunchers can also be hidden using NoDisplay/Hidden, mutiple version can also be in place, each with different configuration (e.g. the three Banshee launchers above)\nYou can also create your own launchers, and read the specification of .desktop files here\n\nA: Dash is your friend\nDash is the first icon on the launcher with an Ubuntu symbol. It is not just for searching for a program name you already know about, like the terminal.\nIf you click on it you will see a short list of recently used programs that are not on the Launcher, along with some files.\nClick on the A (No. 1 in image below) icon on the bottom to get to the Applications page. \n \nNow focus on Installed (No. 2). Here you will be able to see all the programs listed alphabetically. You can scroll down by dragging the handle (No. 3).\nTo see the programs by categories click on the Filter results (No. 4) on the right top. Now you will be able to filter the programs by categories. See the image below.\n\nIf you are looking to see what games are installed, click on Games on the right below Filter results. As you can see I have four games installed. Click the one you want to play, like Sudoku.\nNote, I didn't have to know the name of the game to find it.\nOf course there is more to Dash than just a list of programs.\nHope this helps\n\nA: If you navigate to the \"Ubuntu Software Center\" (which you can do in the way you described, by typing that into the Dash), there is a tab for \"Installed\" (circled in red in the image below), which will give you a categorized list of software already on your machine. \n\nNote: this may not display some applications that were not installed through the Ubuntu software center, but if you're just trying to browse the apps that came with your initial install this will do the trick.\n", "Q: Determine APs wireless regulatory domain The problem that I have observed intermittently as kernel patches come through, is that my wifi does not always obtain the regulatory domain from the AP.

The USA's FCC has ruled that devices must not rely exclusively on APs' regulatory configuration to set their own regulatory configuration; in practice, this means that most devices simply ignore APs' regulatory information and use their own, which tends to be set restrictively by default.\n", "Q: Install windows or newer ubuntu from old Live CD I have an ubuntu 10.10 cd lying around and I want to install either ubuntu 14.04 or windows 7.

A massive virus attack has infested all of our computer lab PCs and the mid-session hassle of formatting and losing data made them balk at the idea of reformatting the PCs halfway through the session-and we suggested they try Kubuntu to be comfortable while enjoying the safety and open nature of Linux.\nThey were thoroughly impressed by the visuals of the KDE Plasma Desktop, and how the Microsoft programs needed by the syllabi (Office 2007, Visual Studio 6 etc.) were running natively in Wine. So this is what we agreed to-we will occupy one PC, put Kubuntu on it, customize it continuously to make it Windows-friendly and then clone the entire lab's HDDs.\nBut we are running into some hurdles which are affecting the comfort of the students-we asked few of my classmates to give Kubuntu a shot, and though they found it much better than Windows, they were confused by some minor things. They haven't used Linux-or any computer operating system save Windows, they lack a bit of intuition, and they found it difficult to hunt for their Windows counterpart programs on Kubuntu-Kate/Notepad, Konsole/Command Prompt, Paint/LibreOffice Draw-specially using the search bar. \nWe wish to eliminate these minor things completely before the entire lab makes the switch to Kubuntu: \n\n\n*\n\n*Disk labels, disk labels, disk labels: We want a drive to be seen as Local Disk C:, Local Disk D:, and not 78.9 GiB Volume, as Dolphin shows it. However, it seems there is no way how to change the labels.\n\n*Adding custom tags to applications listed in Kickoff:  Say, if someone searches for notepad in the search bar, Kate should come up. Or Konsole when we type \"command prompt\". They don't know the names of the KDE/Linux Counterparts at all.\n\n*Custom Sections in Kickoff: Much needed, since guys don't have the patience to look for all of the Microsoft Office and LibreOffice programs combined into one \"Office\" section by the OS automatically.\n\n*Change program labels? Why not? Of course, this is heartburn, but they won't give\ntwo hoots to whether I call a program Media Player or Amarok.\nWe would like your advice please, on these and other issues that might come to your mind when thinking how to make Windows-seasoned folks comfy on Kubuntu-and make them stay on to the magic of open source-and Linux.\nPS: This does sound pretty stupid but please don't ask us to try Xfce or LXDE.

It is simply an implementation of the Windows system libraries for Ubuntu. There is no faster way to run a .exe on Ubuntu than Wine.\nIf you want to have a shared codebase, you will want to compile it on Ubuntu.

Please refrain from suggesting Bumblebee, that would be OT. I'll investigate that, but my question here is if there is a way to disable the onboard Intel GPU if such an option is not available in the BIOS.\n\nA: If you don't have the option to switch GPUs in the BIOS then it's quite likely you have a muxless laptop, where the Nvidia GPU doesn't have direct access to the internal laptop display, and where it wouldn't make sense to switch off the Intel GPU.\nApart from the BIOS, there is a the vga_switcheroo command, which allows one to change which GPU acts as the primary GPU, but this command doesn't work on muxless laptops either -- you're not missing much though, it's tricky to use, and only works on a very limited set of hardware anyway.\nIt's not that dire though, as you have three options available to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bumblebee (Nvidia)\n\n*Nvidia Prime (Nvidia)\n\n*Optimus Prime (Nouveau / Proper Linux Way(TM))\n\n\nBumblebee and Optimus Prime allow you to use the Intel GPU most of the time, but to offload 3D rendering to the Nvidia GPU on a per program basis, and Nvidia Prime allows you to 'switch' which GPU is active, but using software muxing rather than hardware muxing.\nI'd recommend reading an article I've written (Driving Multiple Monitors on an Optimus Laptop) that should hopefully give you a better understanding as to your options, and allow you to confirm whether your laptop definitely is muxless or not.\n", "Q: Two linux kernels show up in rEFInd rEFInd gives me the options to boot 3.13.0-32-generic and 3.13.0-34-generic.

The reason is that the redundancy can be helpful in case one kernel file (or its associated RAM disk file) is damaged. If this happens, you should still be able to use the other file to boot the computer.\nThat said, you can delete old kernel packages. I recommend using dpkg for this task rather than just brute-force deleting the files.

Invoking them by using the -l option makes them login shells, and results in sourcing of ~/.profile. zsh does not use ~/.profile, but ~/.zprofile, because of incompatibilities with other sh syntax.\nMost terminals have an option to run shells as login shells (at least GNOME Terminal, XFCE4 Terminal and Terminator do).

But on the other hand, the logical volume itself reports \"aligned\".\nWhich of those two informations is more correct?\nIf /dev/sda is \"not aligned\", can I somehow get it aligned without reinstall?\nAm I missing something?\nThanks alot!\n\nA: Ok I solved it. Using ubuntu installation usb-stick and gparted I moved/resized the boot and root partition until I got them properly aligned. I checked afterwards with the align-check opt command mentioned in my question. Now everything on the SSD drive seems to be alright.\nNote: Moving boot partition requires grub reinstall.\nJust to mention. The bad alignment probably came from partitioning using Ubuntu's \"disk utility\". It could be that I've messed something up, but still possible that compared to gparted the disk utility doesn't care much about proper alignment. So my suggestion is to use parted/gparted.\nI am not sure if it was needed, but \"aligned\" is much nicer than \"not aligned\" :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu one storage - Is there any chance to recover at all?

My distributed network consists of atleast 10 servers, all of which are running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. This was a design decision, so that we would have a more consistent back-end, as far as the Operating System was concerned..\nthis is also so that we can more easily plan our maintenance workload, with anticipation of the distribution release cycle.\nHowever, I have noticed that on one of our development machines, that which runs Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop Distribution, that there was recently a Hardware Stack Upgrade.\nWe installed this to our machines within the distributed network, instead of upgrading to the latest version of Ubuntu. The idea being that we have the latest candidates for hardware and Kernel support, while still running the long term service distribution which is currently available.\nI logged on the other day, to find out that Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has been released.\n\nMy Question(s) is this:\n\nHow does this effect the software/kernel/OS update, patch, and development cycle of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?\nIs Ubutnu 12.04 Still in service until 2017, such as it was that last time I checked?\nIs there any reason to upgrade our machines to 14.04 LTS, or should be just wait until 12.04 LTS is no longer supported?\nThanks for your time, to whom ever answered this for me!\n\nA: Let me explain a bit how the \"enablement stack\" model works for 12.04 and subsequent releases.\nA problem with LTS releases was that hardware support became \"frozen\" to whatever the LTS kernel supported. However, a lot of new hardware may come out in the 2 years between LTS releases, and while this new hardware is added to non-LTS releases, there was no official mechanism to \"backport\" this support to the preceding LTS release.\nThe \"enablement stack\" model works as follows. When a new stable version of Ubuntu comes out, its kernel and graphics driver stacks get \"backported\" or packaged for the preceding LTS. This enables people using that LTS to upgrade only the kernel and graphics drivers and enjoy the added hardware support (and other features, maybe, as the kernel also gets new goodies all the time) of the most recent Ubuntu release.\nFor instance, 12.04 received:\n\n\n*\n\n*The 3.5 kernel from Ubuntu 12.10 with the 12.04.2 point relase/stack.\n\n*The 3.8 kernel from Ubuntu 13.04 with the 12.04.3 point relase/stack.\n\n*The 3.11 kernel from Ubuntu 13.10 with the 12.04.4 point relase/stack.\n\n*The 3.13 kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 with the 12.04.5 point relase/stack.\n\n\nIn addition to providing new hardware support, this allows Canonical to consolidate support resources: as you noted, once an LTS is released (in this case, 14.04), its kernel gets backported to the previous LTS release (12.04) and that enablement stack will continue to be supported for the remaining 2.5 years before 12.04 ends its life.\nThis way, 12.04 users benefited from hardware support upgrades until a new LTS is available (14.04). At that point they can choose to continue with 12.04 (no additional hardware support, though it will receive security updates), or upgrade to 14.04.\nAnother rationale behind not adding new hardware support to 12.04 is that, if you buy new hardware and are installing from scratch, you may as well install 14.04 which is the most current LTS.\n\nHow does this effect the software/kernel/OS update, patch, and\n  development cycle of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?\n\nAs I mentioned, 12.04 will continue to receive security and other critical updates. However, only the 3.13 kernel for 12.04 will be upgraded; older kernels will not receive any more upgrades, so you really should update to the latest kernel. This is usually safe to do, as those kernels are very well tested. The rest of your applications and software stack stay the same and continue to receive updates until 2017.\nIs Ubutnu 12.04 Still in service until 2017, such as it was that last time I checked?\n\nYes, it is, and it will continue to receive security updates until then. Note however, that there will be NO new \"enablement\" stacks; so the hardware support provided by the 14.04 enablement stack will be the last update it will receive. This means that 12.04 will probably not support new hardware that may come out.\nIs there any reason to upgrade our machines to 14.04 LTS, or should be just wait until 12.04 LTS is no longer supported?\n\nThat's the whole point of the 5-year LTS support cycle. You can keep your hardware and 12.04 installed on them until then, no problem.\n\nA: \nIs there any reason to upgrade our machines to 14.04 LTS, or should be just wait until 12.04 LTS is no longer supported?\n\nThis depends on your needs.  If you're running a low end minecraft server (which I doubt you are) you have no need to upgrade.  But here are some of the Pros of upgrading:\n\n\n*\n\n*More hardware support\n\n*Sometimes a new version of a software you wish to use may not be backwards ported to an older LTS\n\n*Extending LTS\n\n\nBut if you're fine using the software you are using right now, and feel there is no need to upgrade (i.e. your systems are hardened as is, no benefit from going forward, your system is running fine) there is no reason to since 12.04 is a LTS (its EOL is April 2017) it will continue to get security updates just like 14.04 will.  \nPersonally, I would wait for a good time to upgrade your systems and then go for it.  But you have until April 2017 to do that.\nEdit:  You should also watch release notes for software/tools you use and make sure that they are going to continue 12.04 LTS support.  Because that seems like it could be a limiting factory to how long you can wait to upgrade \n", "Q: Which applications should I open with Bumblebee? Having a Nvidia-optimus laptop, I have, on recommendation, installed the Bumblebee optimization. Though I am unclear about when to actively use it.\nThere seems to be a a GUI called Bumblebee GUI where you can configure what should be run through Bumblebee.\nBut what applications or what kind of applications should I open with bumblebee?\n\nA: Optimus is a technology from nVidia that allows you to switch between the lower power Intel graphics that are integrated in your CPU and the higher power nVidia graphics from your discrete graphics card. The big difference between Optimus and other strategies is that even when using the discrete card to do the computations, it still pipes the actual display data through the integrated Intel graphics to your monitor.\nThere's no set rule for which card to use for what program. In general, you should run demanding applications such as games, modelling software, and GPU optimized programs (e.g. bitcoin miners) using the nVidia Card. The only advantage of using the Intel graphics is that it consumes less power. So first try running it using the Intel graphics; if your performance isn't good enough, restart the program using nVidia graphics. See also the help article here.\n\nA: It seems that for Ubuntu 14.04 there is native NVIDIA support for Optimus - named Prime:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/12/more-work-to-support-nvidia-optimus.html\nThere is also some indicator app to help the process:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/prime-indicator-lets-you-quickly-switch.html\nSo, instead of configuring applications lists you could just switch video cards and run whatever app you want on whatever card is active then.\n", "Q: How can I completely erase all data on a (micro) SD card? I just got a micro sd card that I plan on using with the Raspberry Pi.\nI used the KDE partition manager to delete the original partition on the card and to write a new 12GiB ext4 partition. After doing this, the card still says that 6% of it, 30.02 MiB, is being used.\nBasically, I want to completely wipe of the card of all contents so as to prepare it for a new OS. Would a command like shred or dd do the trick or would that destroy the partition as well?\n\nA: What are you trying to achieve?\n\n(A.) Remove all current partitions, to re-use the card:\nTo erase partitions and/or re-format a (micro) SD card, just use gnome-disk-utility (aka 'Disks').\nOR\n(B.) Erase any current (or previous) content on the card, so it can NOT be recovered:\nTo securely erase the card, you need to EITHER physically destroy the card (render into sub-2mm² particles) OR use a utility (from the vendor) to trigger the secure-erase function.\nMultiple writes (of random data), or reformatting will NOT necessarily remove the data.\n\nA: If you just made a new partition, there shouldn't be any actual files on it. That 30MB is probably just the filesystem itself. The partition needs a few different tables and whatnot to actually keep track of files.\nYou can double check that there really isn't anything on it by looking for hidden files with ls -alph from the command line or be enabling hidden files in the \"View\" menu of Nautilus.\nDepending on exactly how you invoke the commands, it is likely that using shred or dd would indeed overwrite the partition table and/or filesystem.\n\nA: You can shred the files before removing them:\nfind /media/user/SD32/ -type f -exec shred -v -f -n0 -z -u   {} \\;\n\nshred params mean: Verbose, force deletion of non-writable files, don't write random bytes (speeds up), write zeroes (much faster), truncate and delete the file after writing zeros.\nThis will get rid of data in a way that they wouldn't be recovered by apps like photorec.\nSee https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27027/how-do-i-recursively-shred-an-entire-directory-tree\n\nA: Your guessing about dd is right. You can wipe the SD card out by the following command (let's assume, that your SD card is /dev/sdd):\nDo not interrupt this command or it could possibly brick the SD card.\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd bs=8192\nNote: If this command does not complete successfully and you have to abort it, then most likely it is recoverable with disk partition recovery programs covered in other posts.\nIt can take some time depending on size and speed of SD card. If you are convinced, that CIA would like to recover your files, then overwrite the SD card with urandom instead of zero:\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdd bs=8192\ndd command from above examples will erase whole SD card, leaving it without any partitions, even with no partition table. So you will need to recreate partition on SD card. You can do this by any partitioning tool like cfdisk, parted (my recommendation) or gparted.\nAnd one more thing: be extremely careful when calling dd command. A typo in of= argument value can cause disaster.\n", "Q: I have some questions about Firewall So I am pretty new to Linux (With the exception of Android), and being use to the old ways of Windows pretty much all I had to do for Firewall was turn it on and forget about it. However with Ubuntu Linux I see it is a bit more complicated than that. I am as of currently using GUFW for Firewall, it is set to allow outgoing and to deny ingoing. I was just wondering  if this might affect any of my programs ie. Skype...etc. from working properly? I am really new to all this and would love to learn more. Help is appreciated. I know you can set rules and what not, but I don't want to set rules for programs if it is not necessary. Just really confused....   \n\nA: You should be fine using the firewall as is. The only time you should have to add a rule or exception is when you are hosting a resource from your machine such as a web site or an FTP server or some other resource that requires clients to connect to you. In this case you are a client (skype) connecting to a remote resource (Microsoft). The profiles used in GUFW are set to allow all outgoing traffic from your PC my default so this should not interfere with any of your Applications.\n", "Q: DIR_MODE has no effect on domain-joined user profiles in /home In /etc/adduser.conf I edited it to be DIR_MODE=0750 so all home directories are not world readable.

I have tried to remove and reinstall dropbox but nothing is changed. \nI suspect this can be due a possible recent ubuntu update.  Has anyone the same problem or now how to solve it?\n\nA: I have the same problem with Ubuntu 16.04. I ran dropbox from the terminal and it suggested to execute the following command to fix the problem, and restart dropbox:\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; sudo sysctl -p\n\nIt worked for me :-)\n\nA: First check whether Dropbox has been installed properly...\nRun this command in terminal:\ndropbox status\n\nIf the output is Dropbox isn't running!\nThen run the following command:\ndropbox start \n\nOr if that doesn't work, try dropbox start -i to locate interpreter if possible.\nNow Dropbox will start and automatically synchronize the updated files.\nFox next time you can run this command to start Dropbox automatically...\ndropbox autostart\n\n\nA: I have a sync problem (16.04) which at least affects Dropbox uploading on eduroam, the WiFi where I work. Syncing does work when invoking Dropbox by terminal. To ensure upload, I've added\nalias drop='dropbox stop && dropbox start && until [ \"$(dropbox status)\" = \"Up to date\" ] ; do dropbox status; sleep 1; done'\n\nto my .bashrc file in my home folder. Running drop in terminal then stops and starts Dropbox and syncs, outputting status until finished.

In ~/.dropbox-dist the main program has been changed from dropbox to dropboxd so my script in /etc/init.d had to be edited to reflect the change.\nLine 4 in the popular Dropbox script should be\nDAEMON=.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n\n(I ran into this problem in both Ubuntu 14.04 and 10.04, and 10.04 is still having problems, namely not syncing when a file is deleted and re-created.)\n\nA: I tried everything at https://www.dropbox.com/help/72 to no avail. The only thing that worked for me (Dropbox 2.10.30 under Ubuntu 14.04) was plugging my computer to a wired internet connection.\n", "Q: Logitech DiNovo Edge USB Bluetooth keyboard quit working after 12.04lts to 14.04lts upgrade I noticed this after upgrading my desktop (commodity PC parts) from 12.04lts to 14.04 lts.

It consists of zeros and ones in a format readable by processor and kernel. If you need, there you can find more information.\n\nA: An object file is an intermediate file produced by a compiler during the steps it takes to produce an executable file.\nFirst the compiler reduces the source code to an object file, in which the machine code for the final product has been mostly produced, and variables and other human readable items have been replaced by tokens.\nSecondly, the linker takes the object file and the libraries requested by the compiler, and puts together the final executable, rendering the tokens in the object file to addresses that a machine can interpret.\n", "Q: Are there really security risk when running Wine? I remember reading somewhere that since Wine's job is to pretty much emulate Windows so that you can run Windows programs, it puts a risk on your Linux machine since Windows Viruses can also run within Wine. Now I know the chances of Windows viruses running within Wine are pretty much a 0.1% of happening. However how much of a risk is this all to my computer? \n\nA: This ultimately depends on your own computing habits. If you constantly download free screensavers and mouse pointers, you'll probably find a WINE-compatible virus in no time. However, if you stick to malware-free programs, you're pretty much safe. The best way to ensure that no malware is installed is by exclusively using Free Software or Open Source Software, as the temptation to add malware in such programs is much less than Proprietary Software, as there is less chance of being able to do so successfully.\nPlease note running a virus on WINE is much safer than running that same virus on Windows, since WINE prevents Windows programs from having Super User privileges, so critical Ubuntu files cannot be (easily) modified. If you want to remove a virus, you can erase the entire WINE prefix (which is the equivalent of wiping an entire Windows installation, except it can be removed and reinstalled from scratch much quicker), wiping the virus with it.\n", "Q: Is it possibe to view a forgotten admin password?

I have been trying for days to get my new version of Ubuntu to automount a CIFS share. According to the mount.cifs man page, the default, in kernels prior to 3.8, was \"sec=ntlm\". The new default is \"sec=ntlmssp\". The man page explains the 9 different security mode options.\n\nA: \nDuring the upgrade process I opted for my samba configuration to be left as it was under 12.04LTS.\n\nWithout having looked into this very deeply, this could be the issue. Sometimes software changes enough between releases to require changes to the configuration files for it to continue to work.\nWhen you're given the opportunity to keep the old configuration file you should have been given the chance to see a comparison or diff of the changes between your version and the new version. You could selectively apply the new version if you wanted.\nYou may be able to fix this with a sudo dpkg-reconfigure samba-common or a sudo apt-get install --reinstall samba-common (I believe it's the samba-common package that houses the config files but I'm not certain).  Take note of any custom configuration so you can re-apply it later if necessary.\n", "Q: a real beginner, Neflix and beyond My daughter and I have a little Acer Netbook, and use it for all our home schooling needs, from online research, email, writing papers, etc, to down time use watching Neflix, Youtube and FB. Can I use Ubuntu on this mini laptop and still do all the things we are used to doing? I'm nearly a complete computer idiot, so talking OS, DOS (how I originally learned computer,but forgotten, over 25 yrs ago), gigabytes, pixels and Platforms is gibberish to me...my eyes glaze over and I just nod dumbly and walk away with no understanding at all. SO! keep it kindergarten for me. \n\nA: Everything you mentioned you want to do should work, except Netflix. Sadly, Netflix require some software that is only available for Macintosh and Windows.\nHowever, you can still make Netflix work if you put in a few extra steps. I have listed two different methods known to make Netflix work. Method 1 is the easiest method to use, but using it will require software that might not be a bit laggy. Method 2 can be more convenient and have less lag, although it will take more work in the beginning.\nMethod 1: Unoffical Netflix app\nThese is an unofficial app which can be used/installed with only three command lines. Open the terminal (CTRL+Alt+T), and type the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipelight/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install netflix-desktop\n\nOnce that is done, you should find a program called Netflix, which can be used to watch Netflix. Easy-peasy.\nMethod 2: Install Pipelight\nI would recommend using Pipelight, which will allow you to use these Windows programs, without actually using Windows. To install Pipelight, make sure you don't have any web browsers open or the Software Center open, and open a terminal (using Ctrl+Alt+T), and run the following three commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipelight/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pipelight\nsudo pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight\n\nWhen you are asked for a password, the same password you use to log on the the computer should work fine. When you open your web browser, you might get a window saying something about downloading and installing some strange software. This is just the software you installed with the above commands getting some components from the internet. It should finish automatically, at which point you will need to change some browser settings.\nIf you attempt to watch Netflix at this point, it will tell you to use Windows. You can trick Netflix into thinking you're alread using Windows by using a User Agent Spoofer. To learn more about how to do so, see the bottom of THIS page (you can press control+F and type We're not done yet. Silverlight should be working now, but some websites such as Netflix check the browser user agent to quickly find the part I'm talking about). Once you finish Netlix should work.\n\nA: It is possible to do all those things.  I also have a netbook with Ubuntu 12.04 installed and I do all those things.  But, I have to say honestly, there is a bar to cross when you transition over to Ubuntu from Windows.  \nDepending on the software you use for those tasks now, it is likely that, except for the browser, the applications you use to perform those tasks will be different.  Slightly different in many cases but still different.\nAnd, if you look at the extremely well written answer above on how to set up Netflix, you will see that when you try to do many configuration things, you will often need to enter terminal commands, which is quite foreign for many Windows users.\nHowever, it is worth the effort.  I would never look back to Windows except for the many legacy games I have collected that I desire to play in the future (and even they are becoming more possible to play on Linux as time passes and as I learn more about the system).\n", "Q: Command is available as user, but not sudo?

Srsly, just don't go there.  I'm not sure what the guise who let the present Opera package into the repos were smoking, but apparently they did not test it against older but still living LTS (Long Term Support) versions of \"supported\" Debian-based operating systems before doing so.  \nIf this ever happens to a system you're in charge of - update attempts returning \"error code 1\" and no changes made because of broken junk - here's a simple fix that works.  Pop open a terminal and do:\ncd /var/lib/dpkg/info/\nThis gets you to the directory where dpkg stores its configuration files related to installed software.  Then do:\nls | grep -i opera \n(replace \"opera\" with whatever package broke your package manager)\nThis command lists every file with \"Opera\" or etc. in its name.  Look them over:  Is anything /not/ related to Opera (or whatever) listed?  If so, take note and delete only the \"offending\" package's files one at a time, using their full names, to avoid breaking other things with similar names.  But if all the returns from your search obviously belong to the borken package, do:\nsudo rm opera\n... replacing \"opera\" with whatever junk has disabled your package manager.  \nResult:  The half-installed broken package will sit on your hard drive \"forever\", an Mortal Insult to All That Is Good And Holy - but doing no actual harm of any kind other than wasting a few MB of drive space.  Unless you go into you /bin directory and remove them by hand.  Either way, you can now update your installed software, install new packages, etc. normally, because your package manager no longer knows that the failed package and its borken parts ever existed.\n\nA: sudo dpkg --configure -a appears to work OK for me, but sudo apt-get install -f then runs into the same [apt] problem as everything else, namely that plymouth-theme-ubuntustudio will be removed, grub starts to update, and then there's an error, or too many errors. iIt halts and the system has been like this since '?'\nAmong those errors:\nline 266 of a cfg file has a syntax error and I cannot determine if '###', in what I conceive to be the file, is markup for commenting, which would mean it surely isn't the file,\nplymouth-theme-ubuntustudio appears only half installed, and there's some efi issue I cannot get to the bottom of...\nI'm contemplating a reinstall as the easiest way out of this, but would prefer to find a simpler undo, hoping it's an easy thing as long as you know what thing, and not go through a longer process if avoidable.\nCurrently there's no apt-get function other than update.\n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu 14.04.

My PC, running Ubuntu from a live CD, is frozen. I think it's because I have too many Firefox tabs open, which is overloading my memory. Is there anyway to use Magic SysRq to only kill Firefox? Or to switch workstations or something to try and restore functionality?\n\nA: No. The nearest thing you can do is use Alt + SysRQ + K which should kill all processes in current VT (in this case it should mean firefox, all graphical programs you were running, your WM and X itself). Then you should be able to switch to another console (using Ctrl + Alt + F[1-6] and run another instance of X from there (I don't use Ubuntu, but I'd bet there is a startx script for that).\nSysRQ enables you to do only very \"violent\" and massive things: shutdown immediately (o), reboot immediately (b), kill everything except init (i), remount all filesystems as readonly (u) ...

When I booted my computer up today, I noticed that a few icons on my dock and panel were missing. However, I am writing this post on the computer of which I speak. So things aren't messed up so bad it's unusable.\nWhat went missing:\n\n\n*\n\n*VLC, Audacity, and some other apps which I have yet to find and probably won't be missed\n\n*Network and audio indicators (kind of important but my system is still usable)\n\n*Something in the Bluetooth stack which is causing it not to work\n\n*Something in PolicyKit, so I can't use GUI packaging tools anymore (doesn't really matter since I use the CLI like a big boy anyway)\n\n\nWhat still works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Network Manager, as it connected to my home wifi just fine\n\n*Mail and power indicators for some inexplicable reason\n\n*Compiz, which starts automatically on login\n\n*XFCE itself, so the system is still perfectly usable\n\n*Pretty much every other app I've installed on my system\n\n\nWhat may be causing a problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed my system from an Ubuntu 14.04 disc and frankenstein'd it into Xubuntu (again, it's been working just fine until now, so that's probably not the problem here)\n\n*I built Vogl for some reason and had to install some development headers (which shouldn't cause a problem) and some Qt5 stuff so it would build - I'm guessing the latter is causing the problem here\n\n*I did update once or twice after building Vogl\n\n\nWhat I've done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*VLC and Audacity installed without any hiccups. What's weird is that it had to install pretty much all their dependencies along with them.\n\n*I installed the network indicator back, and it didn't seem to appear again after logging out and logging back in, and even rebooting. What's even weirder is that the package manager wanted to pull the whole Unity 8 stack along with it, even with the --no-install-recommends flag. That thoroughly confuses me. It's as if the dependencies just changed overnight. This is not like Ubuntu, especially for an LTS release.\n\n*I removed Unity 8, but it pulled the network indicator along with it. Which should be expected, seeing as Unity came along with the network indicator.\n\n*I even removed the Qt5 stuff I had installed earlier, and that didn't help either. The package manager still wanted to pull in the whole Unity 8 stack, which is not what I want.\n\n\nLike I said before, this doesn't make my system unusable per se, it's just that I'll be going back to school in a week and need to be able to connect to the wifi there. So that part is kinda important. The sound indicator I don't need necessarily either, because I still have pavucontrol and my media keys to work with. \nSo my question is now, how can I install the Unity 7 version of the indicators (which had been working just fine in XFCE before this whole fiasco) without pulling in the whole Unity 8 stack? Also, any suggestions for fixing my Bluetooth stack?\nUPDATE: I have gotten the network and sound indicators back. I will look elsewhere to fix PolicyKit and Bluetooth, as it seems these problems aren't related to what packages I have installed. Then again, I could be wrong.

Also, the network-manager indicator is not the same as the \"network-indicator\". The Unity network-manager indicator is part of one of the complete indicator packages included in Unity. (Unity8 is for Ubuntu touch) Furthermore, xfce4 now offers a panel indicator that specifically displays the complete group of Unity indicators.\nRight click on your top panel and select add new item to panel.\n\nYou can safely remove Unity8 and all dependencies by running the following commands:\nsudo apt-get purge unity8\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nFinally, if you don't use lightdm or gdm and you are using the startx command to start xfce instead of signing in normally, certain indicators and features won't be available.\n", "Q: apt-get update error 14.04 Im new to linux and im having this problem whilst trying to fix a grub boot problem. this is the problem if someone could please help me with this. thank you.\nps, freshly installed via DVD, fresh out the box dell inspiron 11 3000 series. 4gb ram. \n\nA: Welcome to the Linux community and Ask Ubuntu! This is one of the newbie mistakes that I know I've made in the past, and it's a rather easy one to fix. Just make sure to use sudo  before the command to avoid this error. For example:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen it will prompt you for your password. Don't be worried when you type in your password and nothing shows up. Just press enter, and if you entered it correctly, the command will run just fine. \nExplanation: Certain functions, like package management, require you to be root. sudo is one of the ways to get root access. All it requires is for you to have administrator rights - I'm assuming you do since you installed Ubuntu yourself. If you're not sure, just run groups in the terminal, and if it lists the sudo group, you have administrator rights and can use sudo.\nHowever, with great power comes great responsibility. Don't use sudo unless you are absolutely sure that you need root access. Package management is one of the few times you'll need this. Another example is if you're editing system configuration files under /etc (although I'm certain you're not on that level yet).\nThis should give you plenty of information so you know what this weird sudo thing is for. If you need anything else, just ask. I will be glad to help.\n", "Q: /etc/sudoers file problem understanding According to the documentation, modifications of this file may enables local users to execute sudo commands on remote machines:\nuser1    192.168.1.14=(user2:group1) ALL\n\nAccording to what I read, this entry enables user1 to execute all commands on the host with the IP 192.168.1.14. How can this be possible?  \nI also have problems understanding what does running commands as different users means?\n\nA: You have misread the documentation. Given the spec:\nuser host = (target_user:target_group) command\n\nin the sudoers of a system with hostname/IP host, user can execute command as target_user/target:group. If the system doesn't have hostname/IP host, this rule doesn't apply. Only the current system's hostname/IP is ever checked. It does not apply to remote systems. Think of this as an administrative tool. A system administrator, with care, can use the same sudoers file on all systems in the network, and use the host specification to distribute privileges accordingly.\n", "Q: White pixels at left border in gnome flashback I run the Gnome Flashback with Metacity session.

In other words, will Ubuntu Touch be laggy like android or smooth like ios?\n\nA: If my memory serves me properly, Ubuntu Touch is based off of Mir and Android. I believe it works the same way as Android does (or at least it did in Surfaceflinger).\nHowever, I have been using it for a while and have seen no lag whatsoever. My (old) iPod lagged much worse though. Must have been all of those \"fancy desktop effects\" Apple programs in.\nThey are (as I know) separate.\n\nA: From the mouth of Mark Shuttleworth:\n\nWith regard to Android I think we have two strong stories. One is a really crisp user experience that was designed from the beginning with this full vision of convergence in mind. That is something that is really difficult to achieve with Android today. We know many people who have tried to create clamshell devices with Android and there are lots of reasons why they've struggled. We have very high regard for the Android team's capabilities but we have a different vision when it comes to the convergence story.\nThe feedback we've had from operators and in user testing is that for\n  a crucial portion of the market, which is the [low-end] smartphone\n  market, the users who today just essentially only make calls and send\n  SMS, that Ubuntu offers a much easier and understandable path to grow\n  those users toward using the Web and e-mail on their smartphones.\n  That's very important for operators. At the low end of the market I\n  think we have a real user advantage experience over Android.\nAt the high end we have the great fortune to be coming to market late,\n  in the sense that Moore's Law has given us at least seven or eight\n  generations of performance improvements since Android came to market\n  and we've been able to take advantage of that. It's the full Linux,\n  it's essentially Unix in your pocket. That means all the security\n  stories that are true of desktop and server Ubuntu are true of the\n  phone, it means the multi-user story is there, it means the\n  application containment story is there, using Linux containers and\n  virtualization. It means the parallel SMP [symmetric multi-processing]\n  multi-core story is there from the beginning. You can do things with\n  Ubuntu devices on the high end that just wouldn't be possible with\n  Android.\n\nAnother advantage cited by Shuttleworth is the ability to run \"native apps, whereas Android has the overhead of Java.\"\nHere is the article I grabbed this from:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/why-mark-shuttleworth-thinks-ubuntu-on-phones-will-outclass-android/\n", "Q: Download apps in ubuntu software centre I am having a problem authenticating in Ubuntu 12.04.

Currently I use Evernote Web, or just nothing at all.\nDoes this not exist?\n\nA: For OneNote, you might have to look outside LibreOffice. There are a few alternatives, and none that I use, so no recommendations. I think each Desktop Environment (GNOME, KDE, etc.) has their own notes app.\n\n*\n\n*Tomboy - I think this used to be available by default on Ubuntu. This is the GNOME notes app.\n\n*Gnote - And I think this replaced Tomboy as the default.\n\n*KNotes - from KDE.\n\n*XFCE4 Notes - from XFCE4.\n\nIn addition, depending on your DE, their might be other options, such as applets for MATE, extensions for GNOME Shell, desklets for Cinnamon, etc.\n\nA: LibreOffice Start page.\nThis doesn't exist in Microsoft office. From here you can:\n\n*\n\n*Launch any of the 6 Office programs (create a new document)\n\n*Open a recent file, from the grid of recent files.\n\n*Open any file on your computer, from the Open File button\n\n*Edit your templates\n\n*Access Help and the Extensions webpage.\n\n\n\nLibreOffice Writer.\nLibreOffice Writer is the equivalent of MS Word. It has all of the basic functions, like Font, Text size, Alignment, and drawing functions, like Rectangles, Circles and various shapes, like Stars, Call outs (Speech Bubbles) and Arrows.\nIt can be launched with the command libreoffice --writer (creates a new document), searching the dash for \"Writer\", or clicking its icon on the launcher.\nHere is the icon, and a cropped screenshot of the Writer window:\n\nAs you can see, in the top bar is the standard tool bars, File, Edit etc. and the formatting tool bar - Font + Size, Colour etc.\nIn the bottom, there is the Shapes toolbar with the Arrows etc.\n\nLibreOffice Calc.\nLibreOffice Calc is the equivalent of MS Excel. It has all of the basic functions, like Font, Text size, Alignment, and some more advanced ones, like Formula insertion, Charts, Cell Colouring and Conditional Formatting.\nIt can be launched with the command libreoffice --calc (creates a new document), searching the dash for \"Calc\" (often Calculator is the first result), or clicking its icon on the launcher.\nHere is the icon, and a cropped screenshot of the Calc window:\n\nAs you can see, in the top bar is the standard tool bars, File, Edit, etc., and the formatting toolbar - Font + Size, Colour etc.\nAt the bottom is the Find search bar. This can be focused with the standard Ctrl+F shortcut.\n\nLibreOffice Impress.\nLibre Office Impress is the equivalent of MS Power Point. It has all of the basic functions, like Font, Text size, Alignment, and others exclusive to Impress, like Custom Animation, different Slide views and default text boxes for tiles that come with the templates.\nIt can be launched with the command libreoffice --impress (Creates a new document), searching the dash for \"Impress\", or clicking its icon on the launcher.\nHere is the icon, and a cropped screenshot of the Draw window:\n\nAs you can see, in the top bar is the standard tool bars, File, Edit, etc., and the formatting toolbar. In Impress, it is a bit different, it has the colour and line settings for shapes you make. This changes to text when you are typing\nAt the bottom is the Shapes tool bar. It has all the shapes that Writer has, but also some extras, like certain freehand shapes, more like Draw (below).\nAlong the side are the tools exclusive to Impress, like Custom Animation, Master Slides and Slide Transitions.\n\nLibreOffice Draw.\nLibreOffice Draw is the equivalent of MS Publisher, a program that doesn't come in the basic MS Office package. It has all of the basic functions, like Font, Text size, Alignment, and others exclusive to Draw, like freehand drawing and better shape manipulation.\nIt can be launched with the command libreoffice --draw (creates a new document), searching the dash for \"Draw\", or clicking its icon on the launcher.\nHere is the icon, and a cropped screenshot of the Draw window:\n\nAs you can see, in the top bar is the standard tool bars, File, Edit, etc., and the formatting toolbar. In Draw, it is a bit different, it has the colour and line settings for shapes you make, as text is less often used.\nAt the bottom is the Shapes tool bar. It has all the shapes that Writer has, but also some extras, like certain freehand shapes.\n\nLibreOffice Math.\nLibreOffice Math has no equivalent to an MS product. It is very different to all the others, it hasn't got the font tools.\nIt can be launched with the command libreoffice --math (creates a new document), searching the dash for \"Math, or clicking its icon on the launcher.\nHere is the icon, and a cropped screenshot of the Math window.\n\nAs you can see, in the top bar is the standard tool bars, File, Edit, etc., but in the standard bar there are unique tools like zoom and special Greek symbols.\nAt the bottom is not a toolbar, that is where you enter the formula. The point of Math is to present your formula in a professional way, instead of trying to get / and + aligned, and formulas over each other.\nAs an example it converts this:\n{π} over { 2 } = sum from { { i = 0 } } to { infinity } { k!} over { (2k +1)!! }\n\nto this:\n\n\nLibreOffice Base.\nLibreOffice Base is the equivalent of MS Access. It is a very specialised tool, and is designed completely around creating databases.\nIt can be launched with the command libreoffice --base (Creates a new document), searching the dash for \"Base\", or clicking its icon on the launcher.\nHere is the icon, and a cropped screenshot of the Base window:\n\nAs you can see, in the top bar is the standard tool bars, File, Edit, etc., however in this view most features are disabled, as this is the navigation window, with links to the base wizard.\nIn the bottom, there is a status bar with details about what you are working on (not included in the screenshot).\n\nKeyboard shortcuts.\nCtrl+C - Copy\nCtrl+X - Cut\nCtrl+V - Paste\nCtrl+Z - Undo\nCtrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z - Redo\nCtrl+P - Print\nCtrl+A - Select All\nF7 - Spell Check (Check spelling as you type is an option, which I think is enabled by default.)\nCtrl+S - Save\nCtrl+Shift+S - Save as\nA list of general keyboard short cuts. Here are the specific ones for Writer and Calc.\n\nCompatibility\nCompatibility with other document types is fairly good. MS Office is not as good at decoding .odt documents, but LibreOffice is quite good at saving in that format. Some features (especially formatting of tables, for me) are a bit hit and miss. If compatibility is key, I suggest using the built in export feature to export it to a .pdf. Normally however, just saving as a .doc or .docx is enough for windows users to access it.\nThey do use different methods to create the same thing, which is why you get issues.\nThe Wiki.\nMost of this came from my memory and experiences. The wiki is:\n\n*\n\n*Less biased.\n\n*More reputable.\n\n*Has more info, and the info is more accurate.\n\nSo I would suggest you have a look in it for information I have (accidentally or purposefully) left out.\n\nSo, essentially, no, there is no alternative to OneNote built-in; you need to look outside of LibreOffice for this.\n\nA: I have recently started using cherrytree. It is exactly what I would look for as an alternative to OneNote. Also other people have good reviews about it on Ubuntu One. You can install it from the Software Center. I have also tried Zim-wiki, but I am liking cherrytree more.\n\nA: You can try Springseed, which is a very handy note taking app for Ubuntu and you can sync to your Dropbox account.\nVisit the Springseed Site for more details.\n\nA: Give Zim a chance!\nI don't fully know MS One Note but maybe you could try zim.  \n\nZim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages. Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various plugins provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.  \nFrom the Zim webpage.\n\nMy use\nI use it as a repository of information I need to use in a daily basis or for some code I need if something goes wrong.  \nBecause it saves the information in TXT files, I put the notes folder in my OwnCloud. So I can read it even I don't have a Zim installed or I'm in another PC. Dropbox or other cloud software that puts a synchronization folder in your filesystem will do.  \nIf you have more than one machine, you could use the same notes in all of them by doing the above.  \nPut your hands on it\nIt looks like this (A little better in Ubuntu with small icons):  \n \nFor more, take a look at a screencast and screenshots.  \nYou will find it in the USC, in the download page or by adding the PPA (From the Launchpad):  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jaap.karssenberg/zim  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install zim\n\nEdit:\nAlso interesting is the Zim Wiki Community Documentation page at Github.\n\nA: Libreoffice does not have an equivalent to Onenote, but nobody says you should use only Libreoffice on your PC. Along with some of the very good alternatives already pointed out by Sardinha 94410 and muru, you may want to use a program with sync capabilities. In that case you should keep in mind that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Evernote works great for taking notes and syncing across devices, and there are two clients which run on Ubuntu (NixNote and Everpad)\n\n*There is a free online version of OneNote which you can use with a Live account\n\n\nI personally prefer using the Evernote web interface, but it's a matter of taste.\n\nA: As you can see in previous posts, LibreOffice doesn't offer something like Microsoft OneNote. I lost a lot of time trying and comparing alternatives and my choice is Joplin. It is an open-source note app with support for Linux/Windows/macOS/Android/iOS and many synchronization options.\n", "Q: dev/loop0 shows 99 % full - Cannot Download files dev/loop0 shows 99 % full.

You will find there in the comment #2 the following workaround (thanks to Tim (darkxst) for it):\n\nadd the following line to the end of ~/.bashrc file:\n. /etc/profile.d/vte.sh\n\n\n\nA: The\n. /etc/profile.d/vte.sh\n\nworkaround did not work for me. However, what did work is: I finally discovered that in the Profile Preferences' \"Command\" tab (right click in the terminal->Profiles) unchecking \"Run a custom command instead of my shell\", if it is checked, can also solve this issue.\n\nA: In 16.04 a symlink may be missing.

I've already tried it on couple of computers, and it works perfectly. Because I want to boot Ubuntu on these PCs just time from the time, I don't want to change boot priority in BIOS. Instead, on startup screen, I hit F12 (or equivalent) and PC lets me to choose from which hardware I want to boot OS.\nThe problem is that on other computer, Zotac Zbox HD, I was not able to get into this boot menu. I've tried hit ESC, F1, F2, F11, F12, Del, but none of them worked. Not that I just wasn't able to get into boot menu, but not even into BIOS. Strange thing is that there's no screen that tells you what you have to press in order to open BIOS or something like that - after pressing start button, for few seconds there's blank screen, then on 2 seconds there's Zotac logo and after that Windows 7 loading screen. My question is - when and what I have to hit in order to access either BIOS or Boot menu.\n\nA: So i've realize this:\n\n\n*\n\n*To enter BIOS, you need to press DELETE \n\n*To enter Boot menu, you need to press F8\n\n\nAlso, you need to press them repeatedly after you press start button at cold start.\n", "Q: Error while exporting picture through content hub \nI'm writing an app and I'm trying to incorporate content hub into it.\nMy app downloads various file formats so I want to be able to export images, videos and other types of content to other apps.\nI followed this content hub guide but found it lacking in examples for exporting content.\nAnyway, when I'm trying to export any content, the transfer's state always changes to \"aborted\" immediately and I have no idea why.\nHere is my OpenContentPopup component:\nPopupBase {\n    id: root\n\n    property var activeTransfer\n    property var items: []\n    property alias contentType: peerPicker.contentType\n\n    Connections {\n        target: activeTransfer\n        onStateChanged: {\n            console.log(\"Transfer state changed to \" + activeTransfer.state)\n        }\n    }\n\n    ContentPeerPicker {\n        id: peerPicker\n        handler: ContentHandler.Destination\n\n        onPeerSelected: {\n            for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n                console.log(\"Sharing item with name: \" + items[i].name + \", url: \" + items[i].url)\n            }\n\n            activeTransfer = peer.request()\n            activeTransfer.items = root.items\n            activeTransfer.state = ContentTransfer.Charged\n            PopupUtils.close(root)\n        }\n\n        onCancelPressed: {\n            PopupUtils.close(root)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen I'm trying to export an image the ContentPeerPicker gives me the option to open the Gallery app, but when I select the gallery app the gallery app isn't opened and it appears that the transfer's state is aborted (or 5..).\nMy logs in the code example give me:\n<debug> Sharing item with name: name, url: file:///home/phablet/.local/share/com.nogzatalz.downow/download/Cover.jpg\n<debug> Transfer state changed to 5\n\nmanifest.json:\n{\n    \"name\": \"com.nogzatalz.downow\",\n    \"description\": \"Torrent downloading app\",\n    \"framework\": \"ubuntu-sdk-14.10-qml-dev3\",\n    \"architecture\": \"armhf\",\n    \"title\": \"DowNow\",\n    \"hooks\": {\n        \"downow\": {\n            \"desktop\": \"downow.desktop\",\n            \"apparmor\": \"apparmor.json\",\n            \"urls\": \"urldispatcher.json\",\n            \"content-hub\": \"content-hub.json\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"version\": \"0.1.28\",\n    \"maintainer\": \"DowNow Support <downow-support@nogzatalz.com>\"\n}\n\ncontent-hub.json:\n{\n    \"source\": [\n        \"pictures\",\n        \"videos\"\n    ]\n}\n\napparmor.json:\n{\n    \"policy_groups\": [\n        \"networking\",\n        \"content_exchange\",\n        \"content_exchange_source\",\n        \"audio\"\n    ],\n    \"policy_version\": 1.2\n}\n\nI really think we need better error messages..\nAny help is appreciated!\nThanks, Tal\n\nA: I think the problem is you are trying to charge it before the transfer is ready.

The images are smooth and pleasant to read. Only thing that lags is when I copy/paste text from my session into the remote one. That takes 2, 3 seconds to pick up and the text is showing slower on the screen than I can type (including the many backspaces to correct typos).\n\n*\n\n*Here is a list of 7 RD clients. It includes a rating system wheren NoMachine NX Client gets an 8 out of 10 and Remina a 10 out of 10. The score explicitly notes \"speed\" as a winning factor:\n\n\nThe winner, by some distance, was Remmina. Performance was exemplary, but that's not the full story. It had the best feedback and responsiveness of any client, and if you didn't know better, the remote desktop might have been a normal-speed local machine.\nMore than the performance though, this client had the best mix of features, and a sensible and well thought-out interface. Although it did split into multiple windows, the controls are always accessible.\nAs well as discovering clients on the network, it has a good way of storing connections, which would still work well if you had to deal with lots of desktops. Support for NX makes this an all-round winner.\n\n", "Q: Is there any application for vimium-like interaction with desktop using keyboard?

I'm looking for (or creating) a script that could take a screenshot from the camera every 10 seconds and save the image to disc with a timestamp for a filename.\nI've found\nstreamer -o 0000.jpeg -s 300x200 -j 100 -t 1 -r 10\n\nBut it only runs once and it doesn't save the filename as something unique, so when the script starts again it will override the previous files with the same name.\nAny ideas on a script that can start taking timelapse photos when my machine starts up?\nThanks.\n\nA: You have a few solutions here, perhaps the best would be to run your command like this in one line:\nwhile true; do streamer -o `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`.jpg -s 300x200 -j 100 -t 1 -r 10; sleep 10; done\n\n\nA: You can use decimals in the rate.

I'm currently working on a low spec machine: IBM Think Pad R51, HDD 80 Gb, RAM 1x 512 Mb and 1x 256 Mb, Intel® Pentium(R) M processor 1500MHz , Graphics Intel® 852GM/855GM x86/MMX/SSE2\nMy question is, what is the most appropriate version of Linux to run lighter on the machine when working with the internet, GIMP and Darktable?\n\nA: If Ubuntu is running slowly it might be worth trying out the other 'flavours' of it. Lubuntu or Xubuntu both use lighter, less resource heavy desktop environments so generally run better on older hardware.\nYou can install the new DE in place with sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop.\nThe next time you log in you can select Lubuntu rather than Unity. More details can be found in this article.\nIt's the same OS underneath so using them is very similar.\nTo be honest, if you are doing a lot of work doing image processing, it might be worth upgrading the computer if possible. If not the whole machine then at least expanding the memory. 768Mb is very little (by today's standards).\n\nA: The Window Manager - or for most modern Linuxes the Desktop Environment - makes a huge difference.  The more bells and whistles (especially 3D ones) your desktop uses, the less resources are left to actually run programs.\nUse a lightweight Desktop Environment like Xfce or LXDE instead of GNOME KDE or Unity (the standard for Ubuntu 14.04) - ie. install Xubuntu (which uses Xfce) or Lubuntu rather than Ubuntu (Unity) or Kubuntu (KDE)... or if you have it installed, install lxde or xfce and set it as default Desktop Enviroment.\nEven more lightweight would be a pure Window Manager like icewm, blackbox, windowmaker or mwm (Motif Window Manager).  A \"Desktop Environment\" is basically an advanced Window Manager (advanced meaning that it has desktop-switching, background-pictures, task-bar and so on), but also with a set of application with a similar and consistent look and feel (eg. how KDE comes with a whole set of KDE-applications for things like editing files, surfing the net, instant messaging etc - all with the KDE look).\nIt's no problem starting an application \"belonging to\" a Desktop Enviroment (like kopete, the KDE instant-messaging client) even if you're not running KDE but runs another Window Manager instead.  Note though that some parts of the Desktop Environment it belongs to may have to be started, so some of your gain by using a lightweight alternative may be lost.\n\nA: There are versions of Ubuntu that take less processing power. If you're using it for graphics, the best is probably Ubuntu Studio because it uses Xfce (Xubuntu) which uses very little resources to run and it's designed for exactly what you do. I run it on an old Pentium 4 and it's awesome.\nAlso, one of the most noticeable improvements you can make to a Linux computer is RAM. It's cheap and well worth the $15-25.\nIf that still isn't working and if you can't afford any RAM, Lubuntu uses the least amount of RAM.\nFinally, you can install either one of these desktops by running one of the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nBut you really won't get the full benefit of Ubuntu Studio without full installation because of the lowlatency kernel, although that could be installed through apt-get as well.\n\nA: There are at least 2 ways to do this...\n1. You can get a distro, like one of these eight tiny linuxes listed on this webpage,  http://m.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/8-of-the-best-tiny-linux-distros-683552\nOr,\nYou can manually build your own kernal for your distro... this is tedious and time-consuming at first... but, once you become familiar with the process and your favorite tools for doing this it can become much easier... the advantage to this is when building your own kernal, you can streamline it... use only the drivers you need and not use all the other hundreds of possible drivers included in a generic kernal... this can make your favorite distro blazing fast but much, much less plug-n-play friendly... There trade offs... you just have to discover which works best for you... I hope that this info has been helpful... also, sometimes you can team up with people who.are on the same track as you and they have already built some kernal you can use... (Use at your own risk, of course)... Good luck...\n", "Q: Once a version of Ubuntu crosses EOL, can no more packages be installed on it?

was emptying /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d, running apt-get update, and then manually adding every key it blocked on to the main /etc/apt/trusted.gpg keyring with apt-key adv as described above.\n\nSo, in your case, you should do the following (disclaimer: could not test it ):\nsudo mv /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d.backup\nsudo mkdir /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d\n\nThen, for each key you need:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 40976EAF437D05B5\n\nwhere you replace the hash with your needed key's hash. As Ionică Bizău noted, multiple keys can be added, separated with a space.   \nWhy it appeared\nApparently, gpg can only handle a limited number of keyrings, and your installation required more. Possibly, this is caused by having many alternative packet sources. \nAgain, from the bug report:\nI asked about the \"resource limit\" message on the gnupg-users mailing list...\nBased on Werner Koch's (the dev) answer...\n...the secure apt related programs might be making gpg use more than the maximum number of keyrings that it can handle\n\n\nA: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys [MISSING KEY] worked for me.\n$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys A040830F7FAC5991\nExecuting: gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --homedir /tmp/tmp.cmBVPKdUNm --no-auto-check-trustdb --trust-model always --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --primary-keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys A040830F7FAC5991\ngpg: requesting key 7FAC5991 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com\ngpg: key 7FAC5991: public key \"Google, Inc.

Server: Ubuntu virtual machine, Client: Windows. \n\nThere are a ton of good tutorials on how to install mysql on Ubuntu. However if you are just using MySQL without the rest of the LAMP stack then I would suggest you look at MySQL Workbench it will give you a graphical frontend to work with your server rather than having to use the command line, PhpMyAdmin is also a good web-based tool but will require the rest of the LAMP stack installing and not just MySQL.\n", "Q: Can't login as root My user is removed from the sudoers file. I don't how it got removed because i only have access to my machine. I tried accessing the sudoers file but it mentions my username and asks the password for it like \"[sudo] password for arunn:\". But it doesn't accepts the password which i normally use to login to my machine and i hve no problem in it. The problem is when i try to use sudo and gives the error when i give the password and the error message as follows \"arunn is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported\". Also i recently added my user name to my virtualbox and will that be the problem ? Please i'm in terriblle situation so help please !\n\nA: You can use pkexec even if you are not in sudoers. Do:\npkexec visudo\n\nand add back an entry for your username. pkexec will accept your password since PolicyKit authorization is configured elsewhere, and is probably untouched by whatever messed with sudoers.\n", "Q: GNOME - Chrome contextual menu colors inconsistent with current theme I've put together an icon/theme combination for my Ubuntu 14.04 + GNOME. \nUnfortunately, my color settings for contextual menu are applied for most applications, but not for Chrome - when I right-click on a website in Chrome, the menu that shows up has different highlight and background colors than what I've designed (the ones that do show up are quite ugly!). The contextual menu in Nautilus looks fine, though. \nHow do I fix that? Is there a separate set of styles for other kinds of contextual menus?\n\nA: Oh, I've figured it out.

I recently got a new laptop (TOSHIBA Satellite C50-B-14D) and just installed a new HDD for it and intended to install Ubuntu 14.04.1 on it.

If it works, you can move the drive further down until it's not working anymore. That way you can see what's causing the problem.\n\nA: I've had this error message before.

I'm on the board of small private (Christian) school in Houston, TX.  We were recently given 10 PC's with erased hard drives. I am currently an Ubuntu user. Would Edubuntu allow me to set up these PC's so that any student can log in on any machine and see his/her home directory on a central hard disk?\n\nA: Yes, on the condition that this central hard disk is formatted as ext. Using NTFS is not advisable(/possible) since NTFS does not recognize permissions as Linux expect them when dealing with /home/. See Is it bad to have /home/ on an NTFS partition? for some more problems you might face (like Linux makes a difference between capital and small letters). \nYou can of course also opt to link the directories in /home/$USER/ to a central disk and have /home/ itself reside on the partition where the OS resides. \nBut this is normal for any Linux, not just Edubuntu or Ubuntu.\nEdubuntu in itself is the same as Ubuntu but the default desktop software installed is targeted on Education. The difference are solely on the desktop. The inner working (ie. mounting of discs, settings etc etc) are still the same.\n", "Q: upgrading Ubuntu version on version I have already upgraded my Ubuntu from 12.04 to 14.04 but my question is why should I do this. As an user of this wonderful OS, what could be the consequences of not to upgrading the Ubuntu version in the future.\n\nA: It really depends on your usage patterns. Newer versions of Ubuntu typically mean: newer kernels, newer versions of unity, newer versions of the tools in the repository.\nFrom a \"conservative\" point of view, you might prefer to avoid upgrades. If your system is running fine (for you); and you do not need newer versions of a certain tool - there is not much gain in moving forward. Although there is only a small chance for upgrades to fail and cause damage to your system - it is still possible; therefore: \"if it is not broken, dont fix it\".\nThe important fact is that you should understand when a version of Ubuntu runs out of support - after that, there won't be security updates, ...\nThe other dimension is: some people just like to run \"latest-greatest\". This means that you might enjoy newer features earlier than other users - but it can also mean that you have to deal with bugs that other users do not see.\n\nA: 12.04 will retain its support until April 2017, so you could keep 12.04 until then and still receive security and hardware compatibility updates and bug fixes. After that point you put your machine at risk of security vulnerabilities and you may not be able to use newer hardware coming out, so it would make good sense to upgrade to 14.04 and receive updates well into 2019.\nThe motivation for upgrading right now would be to utilize the new features introduced in a stable version that you will likely be switching to down the road anyways, so you may as well get used to them now. \n", "Q: Boot is full (no prior solutions helped) I have already seen that this page as well as the ubuntu forum itself has quite some similar questions, but none of the solutions has helped me yet, so I'll try it here as well: \nThe general problem is that my boot is full and it all started because I wanted to update my Skype (4.2. it doesn't want to connect) as well as install the newest updates of the OS. \nHere's how the space situation looks like:\ndaniel@daniel-SVS1512Z9EB:~$ df -h \nFilesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root 909G 803G 61G 93% /\nnone 4,0K 0 4,0K 0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev 3,9G 4,0K 3,9G 1% /dev\ntmpfs 787M 1,2M 786M 1% /run\nnone 5,0M 0 5,0M 0% /run/lock\nnone 3,9G 1,2M 3,9G 1% /run/shm\nnone 100M 36K 100M 1% /run/user\n/dev/sda1 228M 226M 0 100% /boot\n\nAs I have read that 228MB should normally be enough for a /boot space as well as to increase the /boot space is a bit tricky.

It's so good at what it does that the developer, who stopped updating it as of 12.10 restarted after all the positive feedback he got.  See his blog\n\nA: When I run out of room, I just remove the oldest version of all the generic files, i.e. if N is the number preceding \"generic\" in the filename: \nsudo rm *N-generic\n\nYou can do this for the lowest numbers until you gain enough space.

Let me document something just incase it was missed.\nMy upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 pauses on a package configuration.  The first time I did this I found it to be stuck on a screen saying <Ok> to continue.  It seemed unresponsive as I was unable to choose \"Ok\" with the tab or by way of the mouse and unable to proceed.  I hacked around that the first time by guessing and killing that process.  This time, I came to my senses and finally figure out that I could hit tab 3 or 4 times to select \"<Ok>\" then press Enter (I did not screen shot that screen).  So, this should be documented somehow, I would be concerned for anyone upgrading.\nSo, if you unable to select \"<Ok>\" .. tab repeatedly until it gets selected then press enter.\nNow I'm faced with a choice below but I don't know what the implications are.  I have gdm installed but I will go with unity.  I don't see a link between Unity and lightdm.  \nWhat are the implications of choosing either?  \n\n\nA: LightDM and GDM are Display Managers.  If you choose one over the other, the login screen you get differs. That's about it from an end-user perspective.  You can always choose the Display Manager by running:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm # or gdm   \n\nYou will be presented with a dialogue like the one you have been shown now, and you can select which ever one you want.      \n", "Q: Google Chrome Tabs Crash Chrome version 36.0.1985.143\nUbuntu 14.04\nAfter upgrading to 14.04 Google Chromes tabs crash. I'm not sure of the conditions on how to make them crash. But after idk a few hours or a day of using Chrome or after I restart Chrome I'll go to open a new tab and it just crashes. Even when it's just an empty tab. \nIt seems to do it maybe based on the amount of resources the page uses? For example if I try to open the Google play store site, the tab crashes (right now). If I go to just google.com the page works. I could open another site and it loads, but when I try to scroll down it crashes. \nI have about 41 tabs open in 4 different windows. I've tried turning off all plug-ins and apps as the crash page suggests but with no luck.\nI'm on a Dell Latitude E6530 8gb of ram.

I try to open an new tab, it crashes. And this is a new tab with nothing on it, Chrome's default tab page. The crash is the \"Aw, snap!\" crash. The page will sometimes load, then I scroll down and it crashes. \nIf I had to guess, it would have to do with the amount of tabs I have open. \nI'll try @Matthew Greenlaw's solution and report back.\n\nLooks like @Matthew Greenlaw's issue is the same one I'm having.

Use Chrome until you have a crash and then look over the terminal to see what sort of errors you see on crash.\nIn my case, I had the same exact issue with Chrome crashing when a new tab was opened. It was being caused by Google Chrome exceeding the limit of files that my user was allowed to have open at one time.

So you need to split -j4 to -1 1 -2 4 .\nTry this:\njoin -o '2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 1.2' -2 4 -1 1 <(sort -k1 FirstFile.txt) <(sort -k4 SecondFile.txt)\n\n\nA: You could us python.\nSave the following in a file called join.py in your home area:\nffile=open('FirstFile.txt','r').read().split('\\n')       # Open the first file, read it and split it into a list at the newline character\nsfile=open('SecondFile.txt','r').read().split('\\n')      # Open the second file, read it and split it into a list at the newline character\nminlen=min(len(ffile),len(sfile))                        # Get the lengths of both, and return the minimum so it doesn't break if they are different lengths.\nofile = [] # Create an empty list.    \n\nfor i in range (minlen):                                 # Loop for the length of the shortest list.\n    ofile = ofile + [ffile[i]+sfile[i]]                  # Add the first item of the first list (the first line of the first file) to the first item of the second list (the first line of the second file).\n\noutfile=open('outputfile','w')                           # Create an output file, called outputfile.txt in your home directory\n\noutfile.write('\\n'.join(ofile))                          # Write to the output file.\n\nthen run it with \npython join.py\n\n", "Q: Recovery of formatted hard drive! i had accidentally erase everything option while switching to ubuntu. can you please help me to tell me how recover that drive please as there are many important documents and photos. please if i can get your help..\n\nA: There is an earlier thread which addresses this issue:- How can I recover my data after replacing Windows with Ubuntu?\nFirst bit of advice in there is \"Stop using the drive!\"\nBest of luck...\n", "Q: Do higher level scripting languages use shell scripts to work? I'm just learning about bash and when I saw that bash uses 'echo' I tried to search for the relationship between PHP and bash and it seems like people are building programs were bash script and PHP scripts are mixed together. \nDo scripting languages like Javascript and PHP use shell scripts to work? Do PHP and Javascript interpreters in any way dependent on shell scripts? \nIs this any different when it comes to compiled code? (I know that the separation of scripting languages and compiled languages are not that clear cut since you can compile Javascript and interpret some of the languages which are normally compiled. So in this part of the question I'm asking whether there is any difference when it comes to compiled code, regardless of language.)\n\nA: There is no relation at all between \"echo\" in bash and \"echo\" in PHP. They just happen to share the same keyword for the same action, they do not depend on each other. Often times the design of some languages influences another languages, and those that design new languages features often took inluence from existing languages. These are why many languages uses $prefix for variables, why some keywords are commonly seen across languages, and why many languages uses curly braces for block separation. While they may copy the syntax or the general design of the feature, they are usually independently implemented.\n\nDo scripting languages like Javascript and PHP use shell scripts to work? \n  Do PHP and Javascript interpreters in any way dependent on shell scripts? \n\nNo they don't use shell scripts to work. Both the shell and these languages depends on the operating system's stream writing interface. Say in Linux, if you want to print to stdout, you need to do a write() system call to the kernel by causing a software interrupt with the syscall id for the write() syscall, the pointer to the data that you want to write, and the file number for stdout which is 1. Whether you use the shell, an interpreted language, or a compiled language, they all will have to, call the write() syscall to write to the stdout. Some languages may only allow you to write regular string, others might provide basic formatting features, but all of these will end up with a write() syscall.\n\nA: They don't. The codebase behind the runtime environments and libraries may use shell scripts as glue, but runtimes of languages like JavaScript and PHP don't depend on them. The use of commands like echo and printf are indicators of the languages the creators were influenced by, such as C and shell. This also holds true for compiled languages.\nStep back for a moment and wonder if the presence of constructs like if and for and while mean that the execution of shell scripts depend on C or vice versa.\n", "Q: cannot find -lboost_thread-mt I'm getting 2 errors:\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_thread-mt\n\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_program_options-mt\nwhat is the simplest way for me to install -lboost_thread-mt so that i can finish my install of PsMoveInput\nplease note that i need the -lboost_thread-mt and ive tried installing \"all boost\" which didn't work\nIve installed all the others and even read somewhere that the -lboost_thread-mt isnt available and if thats the case is there a archive i can get it from? \nThank you and sorry for my lack of technical terms.\n\nA: I experienced the same problem on installing Field3D. It seems that the file name is libboost_thread.so instead of libboost_thread-mt.so. So it is a bug and should be handled by changing the term in the source file. \nFor field 3D, change buildSupport.py. Search for the -mt and remove.

I have generated a time-lapse series of images and have named them sequentially {0000..9999}.jpg\nThis isn't great for browsing the whole set as it's harder to tell when a given image was taken from its filename. I would like to rename them so their names contain their creation date, eg:\n0000.jpg → 20140815-142800-0000.jpg\n0001.jpg → 20140815-142800-0001.jpg\n0002.jpg → 20140815-142800-0002.jpg\n\nIt's important to preserve the original filename elements and the exact date formatting isn't that important, as long as it's filename-safe and easy to understand. My example above inserts it at the front in a way that is conducive to sorting by date.\nIf you want test harness of files, the following will create 10 files with ascending creation times:\nfor i in {00..02}; do touch --date \"2014-08-15 $i:$i:$i\" 00$i.jpg; done\n\n\nA: You can use rename with a real Perl expression\n$ rename 's/(\\d+\\.jpg)/use File::stat; sprintf(\"%s-%s\", stat($&)->mtime, $1)/e' * -v\n0000.jpg renamed as 1408057200-0000.jpg\n0001.jpg renamed as 1408060861-0001.jpg\n0002.jpg renamed as 1408064522-0002.jpg\n\nThat leaves the files with a time-since-epoch. Find for sorting, poor for reading.\nThe only problem here is you need to match the whole filename (so that you can stat $& —aka the entire match— inside the substitution). That could get a little tiresome with really complicated names.\nWe can build on that to have a more conventional date formatting:\n$ rename 's/(\\d+\\.jpg)/use File::stat; use POSIX; sprintf(\"%s-%s\", strftime(\"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S\", localtime(stat($&)->mtime)), $1)/e' * -vn\n0000.jpg renamed as 20140815-000000-0000.jpg\n0001.jpg renamed as 20140815-010101-0001.jpg\n0002.jpg renamed as 20140815-020202-0002.jpg\n\n\nA: And something bash-based for simple filenames (like the example):\n$ for f in *; do mv \"$f\" \"$(date -d@$(stat --printf='%Y' \"$f\") +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)-$f\"; done\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 oli oli 0 Aug 15 00:00 20140815000000-0000.jpg\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 oli oli 0 Aug 15 01:01 20140815010101-0001.jpg\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 oli oli 0 Aug 15 02:02 20140815020202-0002.jpg\n\n\nA: Here's something I reworked so I could actually understand what was going on.

Open Nautilus, and sometimes (about a third of the time) my phone is there. When it isn't there, the only solution is to reboot Ubuntu. When it's there, clicking though to the phone's folders sometimes works, and sometimes results in an error.

There were a lot of other issues with the 'upgrade', so I just reformatted and installed 14.04 on the empty drive to solve ALL my problems.  The upgrade seemed like it worked, but the more I used it, the more it was obvious that there were a ton of little things that were broken that made the system frustrating to use.  (wacky java and other lib problems.... HW-stuff broken or unreliable like this, etc...)\nTry booting from a 'live USB' version of 14.04 and see if that fixes this problem, if it does, you may have other issues and it'd be easiest to backup what you need and re-install to fix all of it at once.\n\nA: As far as I know, MTP works fine in Trusty.

Not even with clean live cd. After resuming from suspend and logging, destop appears without Unity or other menus and totally freezes not even mouse pointer can be moved. If powerbutton is pressed shortly in the stuck situation result is 1/10s showed commandline error message(may I should take videoclip of that?) and finally blank screen which requires long press of powerbutton. CTRL-ALT-Fx -terminals doesn't work on the situation. Suspend worked greatly with 12.10, so what has been broken this feature and what I can do? That macbookpro is my thirtiary computer, so the the problem is not big for me. I guess that problem is that some of the kernel modules cannot wakeup or X-windowing is confused but those are only guesses. I know that mac-users are a marginal group of Ubuntu users, but I would be glad as Ubuntu enthusiast if somebody knows the workaround.\nBr. Mikko\n\nA: I had the same issue on the same setup. Per the community wiki instructions for the MBP 3,1 revision\nI switched the nvidia-331 using the Additional Drivers utility, and the suspend problem cleared up. (It did, however, cause problems with the Ubuntu boot splash screen not appearing. This is fixable -- see The instructions here at binarytides -- though note an important error in those instructions: The file /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash should include only FRAMEBUFFER=y (minus the quotes), NOT echo FRAMEBUFFER=y as shown.)\nIf you don't want to mess with the video drivers, the community wiki page for using 13.04 Raring Ringtail with MBP 4,1 models describes a fix involving creation of a script called macbook.sh in /etc/pm/sleep.d (use same URL as first link above, but change \n\"3-1\" to \"4-1\" and \"Trusty\" to \"Raring\").

I know what you're thinking... why are you installing desktop? I have asked the same question myself over and over again! The individual that will be using this server wants to use the GUI version of Virtual Box and as a result wants nothing but the Desktop version of Ubuntu installed. That issue aside, here is the weird part. I create a RAID 1 array between the two drives like normal and do the install like normal. Everything works great and the system installs successfully. Then upon reboot it drops me to the BusyBox v1.21.1 shell. I get dropped to a (initramfs) prompt. If I pull one of the RAID 1 drives and boot again, it will boot just fine. If I replace the drive and pull the other drive, it also boots just fine. This tells me it is something to do with RAID. ie, when the RAID array is degraded, it is just booting off a single drive as if no RAID was present. When the RAID is active though, it seems it cant boot.\nAlso, before you ask, we have confirmed this is not a hardware issue. I thought we had a RAID hardware issue and so I shipped the original server back and had it replaced with a completely different but identical server. I just tried to do the install again this morning on the new server and ran into the exact same issue.\nSeems like this is a driver issue, but I have never experienced this before with Ubuntu.\nAny thoughts?\nThanks!\nHere is the shell I get dropped to with output:\nGave up waiting for root device.

He did this last time when I left my laptop at room. Opened the system recovery mode from advanced Ubuntu options and changed the password using 'passwd usrname ' command.Is there anything I can do for this to not happen in future.\n\nA: For this user case probably the best \"solution\" is to re-install Ubuntu with full encryption (LUKS). This would secure the data and prevent changing the  root/users password(s).\nThis could be defeated with a few methods, both hardware (key loggers) and software (custom kernels), but both of those options are unlikely. The OP can assess these risks.\nWith the above suggestion, I agree with the advice that the ultimate solution is to prevent physical access. In general physical access is root access via any number of techniques.\n\nA: Yes. Set the root password. Open a terminal, and do:\nsudo passwd\n\nEnter a password. Then the root shell in recovery mode will always ask for this password.\nNote that all this is futile as he can boot into a live USB and change your password.\nUltimately, given physical access, the security battle is lost.\n", "Q: Can't open java mind-mapping create from Freeplane I've created mindmap in freeplane and then export it as \"Java\", that gave me a html file and a folder.\nWhen I open this html file in windows it works correctly in Google Chrome and Firefox.

That worked the first time.\n\nA: Repair solve your problem.\n1st option : get a disk including Boot-Repair\nThe easiest way to use Boot-Repair is to burn one of the following disks and boot on it.\nBoot-Repair-Disk is a disk starting Boot-Repair automatically.\n\nBoot-Repair is also included in Linux-Secure-Remix. \n\nRemark : you can also install the ISO on a live-USB (eg via UnetBootin or LiliUSB or Universal USB Installer).\n2nd option : install Boot-Repair in Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*either from an Ubuntu live-session (boot your computer on a Ubuntu live-CD or live-USB then choose \"Try Ubuntu\") or from your installed Ubuntu session (if you can access it)\n\n*connect to the Internet\n\n*open a new Terminal, then type the following commands (press Enter after each line):\n  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n  sudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\n\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nUsing Boot-Repair\nRecommended repair\nlaunch Boot-Repair from either :\n    the Dash (the Ubuntu logo at the top-left of the screen)\n\n    or System->Administration->Boot-Repair menu (Ubuntu 10.04 only)\n    or by typing 'boot-repair' in a terminal \n\nThen click the \"Recommended repair\" button. When repair is finished, note the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXX) that appeared on a paper, then reboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs.\nIf the repair did not succeed, indicate the URL to people who help you by email or forum.\n\nThis will work for me. I hope this is help you.\n\nA: I am posting this as I just hit this bug.\nFor me, on my hardware …\n\n\n*\n\n*As you boot, enter your bios -> disable secure boot\n\n*Ubuntu should now boot …\n\n*Install and run boot-repair\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\n*Run boot-repair, go with the default options. As you run boot repair it will ask you to run a few additional commands.\nApparently the upgrade to 14.04 does NOT include signed kernel images (you will see in the error messages).\n\n*After you this finishes, you should be able to re-enable secure boot and Ubuntu will boot.\nWARNING – Although this repaired Ubuntu, it trashed Windows and although I can get Windows to boot, Windows is throwing warnings about missing EFI files and I can not repair it when booting from the recovery disk (yes I ran all the commands to fix the windows boot, at least the ones that were provided with the windows repair disk. I did not provide those details as they are available on Google and the fix is unrelated to Ubuntu).\nThis is quite the nasty little bug when upgrading from LTS -> LTS\n", "Q: .sh file on Startup Applications isn't executed This is a followup to a question about dialog boxes.\nI want to show a dialog box both at the start of a session, and after n minutes of inactivity. I have decided to use zenity and xautolock. I have success invoking both from the command line (bash).\nzenity --text=text --warning\nxautolock -time 15 -locker \"zenity --text=sometext --warning\"\n\nHowever, there are some constraints:\n\n\n*\n\n*The text has multiple words. If it has spaces, zenity will only show the first word and try to parse the other words as parameters. To fix this, I enclose the text in double quotes (\"), but it leads to:\n\n*xautolock takes the entire zenity command as an option for its -locker parameter. The command has multiple words, so I have to enclose it in quotes. But it already had quotes originally, so it conflicts on quotes-inside-quotes.\n\n*I want the alert text to be customizable, so I'm using --text=\"$(cat .filename)\".\n\n\nSo now what I have is:\nzenity --text=\"$(cat .filename)\" --warning\nxautolock -time 15 -locker \"zenity --text=\\\"$(cat .filename)\\\" --warning\"\n\nIf I run each line separately on a terminal session (bash), they do work. The cursor gets stalled waiting for the process to terminate, but the dialog boxes are displayed the way I need them.\nNow I need it to start automatically with no user intervention. What I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've put each line separetedly on the Startup Applications list. Instead of showing the desired text, they will show $(cat on the dialog box.\n\n*I created a command.sh file on my ~ folder, pasted these two lines, made it executable.\n\n*Running the script from the command line works.\n\n*Puting ~/command.sh as an entry on Startup Applications does not work. Nothing happens, nothing is displayed, no error message, nothing. According to this answer, it should work.\n\n*Putting /home/username/command.sh does work, but this user is just a \"skel\" that gets copied to a guest user folder created upon login, so the username folder will be \"guest-RANDOMSTRING\", and I can't set is as a Startup Applications entry. For permission reasons, I can't set in to the \"skel\" user as well.\n\n\nA: Try putting them in a script and adding that script as the entry in your Startup Applications. It's hard enough to use environment variables and ~ in desktop files, let alone full-fledged command substitution, as evinced by Desktop Files don't seem to use $PATH correctly and How to include environment Variable in launcher for icon.\n\nA: Turns out each entry on the Startup Applications list gets created as a .desktop file on ~/.config/autostart$. \nAs mentioned by both @muru's answer and an answer on the question he linked, .desktop files don't expand the tilde as the shell would. Neither they seem to have the ${HOME} variable. \nSo the solution was to add the following line to the ~/.pam_environment file:\nPATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:${HOME}/scripts\n\nThen place my .sh script on the ~/scripts folder, and add script.sh, no prefixes, to the Startup Applications list.\n", "Q: Internet conection problem when updating Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 Server Upgraded my server's software from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04 and now the server cannot access the internet.  \nI can ping devices on my LAN, including my modem.

Your gateway should only be shown once, and this hints at a loop at your gateway - but all your other systems work fine, and according to what you write, it's only the local system that changed.\nThe only thing that I can remotely think of is if you had an iptables rule roughly like this:\niptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING ! -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source 1.2.3.4\n\nWhere 1.2.3.4 is some bogus or possibly previously valid IP address that no longer works.\nThis would let local traffic work but anything going out beyond the local network would break because replies would go to the wrong place. Your gateway may block traffic like that because it is in essence 'spoofed' traffic.\nI think you would get a good hint to the issue with some traffic inspection at your gateway if it is at all possible.\nIf you can't do that - quite understandable - then maybe set up another Linux box on your network and make it the default gateway for this faulty system, and then you can inspect the traffic it is generating. This is assuming that the fault is on the upgraded system. If you configured that 2nd Linux box to ip_forward and make it's gateway the 192.168.0.1 device you might also see more useful info to help nail down the cause.\nWill be interesting to see what it was when you finally get it sorted.\n\nA: Try to go into \"/etc/resolv.conf\" and below the lines starting with #'s add these lines:\n \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\"\n \"nameserver 8.8.4.4\"\nSee if you can connect after doing this. Do not reboot after changing the file, just save it and test your connection. If this works then it was a DNS problem. The changes made to the file will be undone after a reboot.\n\nA: I had exactly the same situation - no internet connection, no ping to outside, no ping from router to the box. But a working SSH connection from another workstation in the same LAN.\nThe cause was the router who was blocking the new box as it had the same IP as the replaced old box, but a different MAC address.\nAs soon as I changed the IP everything worked.\n", "Q: An Ubuntu/Linux alternative of Bulk Rename Utility for Windows? I have only spent 5 months with Ubuntu and it has been an awesome experience, I hardly boot into Windows now, but there are some things I miss, like the Bulk Rename Utility I used to have in Windows. \nI use the program a lot when I boot into Windows but I'd prefer if there was an alternative or something similar cause the program had a plethora of renaming options with a decent gui.\nI'm aware of the rename command in terminal, but I've never had any luck with it.\nA screenshot of what it looks like:\n\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an alternative of this program for Ubuntu?\n\n*A great command line resource on how to get this done without a gui?\n\n\nA: GPRename and pyRenamer are available in the repositories. Both are similar and easy to use, although pyRenamer is a dead project.\n\nA: Pyrenamer is my tool of choice. It's straightforward to use and has a preview mode.\nsudo apt-get install pyrenamer\n\nMore details from here:\n\n\n\nA: I have found a lot of details on tools already mentioned under this question at http://www.webupd8.org/2016/03/quickly-batch-rename-files-in-linux.html, and I have edited the answers mentioning them in order to add such details.\nThere is another tool mentioned there that seems the most advanced:\nMetamorphose2\nHere's its presentation at the above address:\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install metamorphose2\n\nI have used Thunar bulk rename for a long time but the above is much more complex and has a feature that I was missing, the option to undo changes.\nThis tool seem less intuitive and complicated for simple operations. (A great advantage of the Bulk Rename tool in Thunar is the ability of having a list of files outside the file manager that can be modified easily by drag&drop.)\nBut once you understand how it works it can be useful. \nA few tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are supposed to first select the \"Picker\" tab. But by default all files and folders (of the selected path) are selected and, if you do not want to rename them all, you have to un-select them all by clicking \"none\" and then select them one by one with single-left-click. (I find this annoying, and prefer to put all files that need renaming in a separate folder, and then select the \"Picker\" tab. - As far as I can tell, that would be the way to go for the Windows tool mentioned in the question either, as its behavior is similar.)\n\n*Once the files are selected, go to the \"Renamer\" tab and select one of the \"Available\" actions by double-clicking it. It all becomes available from this point forward.\n\nFor what it's worth - the Windows program Bulk Rename Utility works fine in Wine/Playonlinux.\n\nA: But... But... You've already found the answer... rename really is the best thing since sliced bread. If you need some examples of it doing really cool things, I've written a few in my time here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple replacement (another example: Changing extensions)\n\n*Zero-padding existing numbers\n\n*Shunting existing parts of a filename around\n\n*Rewriting entire directory structures\n\n*Inserting the creation/modified date from each file\nIf you need specific help, ask and somebody here can deliver.\nFailing that simple Bash scripting is an option in most cases.\nSidebar: I defy anybody to call rename or regular expressions complicated after you've seen the screenshot of Bulk Rename Utility. Holy balls, I almost forgot how ugly it was.\n\nA: There is the Bulk Rename utility, which is part of Thunar, the default file manager of XFCE desktop environment (the one used by Xubuntu). Selecting multiple files in Thunar and selecting \"rename\" opens the tool, but it can also be started separately.\n\nIt has different options of action, which together may come close to those of the Windows tool.\nThis documentation may be of help.\nSome details also here (mentioning other tools too).\n\nIf you prefer to use a different file manager, you may still use this tool. It cannot be installed separately from Thunar but the latter brings very few specific dependencies and can be installed easily. The tool can be started separately though, and can even be integrated as a custom menu action in other files managers like Dolphin and Nautilus.\nExample for Dolphin: create the file ~/.local/share/kservices5/bulk-rename-thunar.desktop with these lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Service\nServiceTypes=KonqPopupMenu/Plugin\nMimeType=all/all;\nActions=BulkRename;\nX-KDE-StartupNotify=false\nX-KDE-Priority=TopLevel\n\n[Desktop Action BulkRename]\nName=Bulk Rename\nExec=thunar -B %U\nIcon=dialog-information\n\n\nA: You may want to check this one: rnm (web page).\nSome Usage:\nrnm file-name -ns new-filename             # signle file\nrnm ./* -ns '/fn//i/'                      # files will be sorted and indexed.\nrnm ./* -rs '/search/new/g'                # 'search' in filenames will be replaced with 'new'\nrnm ./* -ns '/fn//i/' -ss 'search'         # only files/directories which contain 'search' in their name will be indexed (renamed).\nrnm ./* -ns '/fn//id/' -fo                 # file only mode, directories will be ignored.\nrnm ./* -ns '/fn//id/' -fo -dp -1          # recursive to subdirectories all the way.\n\netc...\n\nTo undo an unwanted rename:\nrnm -u\n\nYou can find more examples/docs here.\n\nA: Bulk rename utility does work with linux via wine. But it get hangs on certain operations. We will get used to it and we will automatically skip doing such operations after familiarizing them. I am very satisfied with it.\n", "Q: How to scroll down vboxmanage output? When I type the vboxmanage command I get a sort of manpage output, where it shows all the information at once. How can I view the info incrementally like less/more commands with files?\n\nA: Typing just vboxmanage will give the help page output to stdout - if this on a TTY etc, you won't be able to scroll it. To make it work like man, you can pipe the output to less:\nvboxmanage | less\n\nThen you can 'scroll' it with arrow keys/page keys/home or end/mouse wheel/whatever. You can pipe it to more as well, but less is 'nicer' 'easier' to use.\n", "Q: How to install xnviewmp in ubuntu 14.04?

This seemed completely crazy to me, but nonetheless I switched the theme to 'Industrial' under Preferences, Customize Look and Feel and voila!\nMy browser has been open and running for days now finally. Prior to doing this my browsers would crash every 3-5 minutes and sometimes immediately upon trying to open (which makes searching for help miserable). It makes no sense to me how the theme of an OS could have any impact on a browser but I tried everything else suggested and nothing worked, but this is what fixed mine.\n", "Q: Skype video freeze Ubuntu 12.04\nbeen skype(ing) with skype version 4.2something and its been fine, Had an an email from skype saying that I needed to update to new version skype-ubuntu-precise_4.3.0.37-1_i386.deb if I wished to continue logging into skype.\nSince installing the upgrade on my pc the video of me on the remote pc freezes after about 5seconds and stays frozen until switching the video off and on my end, it will animate for again 5ish seconds before freezing again, this did not happen while I was using the 4.2 version.\nI cant find a 4.2 version to revert back to and the one in the software centre appears to be an old beta too old to work.\nThe only adjustment I can find for skype video is check or uncheck auto exposure which makes no difference to the freezing.\nAt my end there seems no perceptible difference between versions, its ok but the video freezing on the remote pc is a consequence of my version upgrade.\nGrateful for any suggestions of a fix\n\nA: Since I upgraded to 14.04 Skype and VLC among others have not worked properly for me too.\nVLC video was not appearing, and I managed to fix it by changing the output (it is in the preferences). \nFor Skype:\nI have read different posts online, most of them suggest it is an issue with Open GL or the graphic card. I still have not managed to solve it but a good starting point is this post:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/386737/176483\nor possibly removing the video card drivers and installing a newer version.\nI hope this helps even the slightest.\n", "Q: just upgraded to 14.04 and my super key doesn't work and I can't find the dash either I have been using an old version of Ubuntu  and then Skype stopped working an I was told I would need to upgrade. So now I have had the experience of upgrading to this new version 14.04 and Skype works again but sadly the super key doesn't work, I have no side bar, I can't find the dash, Google chrome doesn't work and my mouse pad scroll doesn't either (not that the this really matters to me).\n\nA: As Akiva wrote, a fresh install would probably fix it. However, before doing that, you may want to ensure that all packages which should be installed are installed. You can do so by installing the ubuntu-desktop package.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: When moving to a newer version of Ubuntu, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*To Upgrade.\n\n*To do a fresh install.\n\n\nGiven that you moved from a very old version of Ubuntu, there is a high chance that an artifact from the old version has compromized your system somehow. This is common, and happens to the best of us. In my experience, as I have dealt with this sort of issue a lot, the quickest way to solve this issue is to do a fresh install of Ubuntu. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop. \nAn analogy if you prefer, is that doing a fresh install is like tearing down a bug infested house, destroying all the nests and getting rid of all the water damage, and just building from scratch. All you do, is remove the furniture from your house to your neighbours garage, rebuild, and then move back in.\n", "Q: \"Failed to load the package list\" - fixes posted not working I have a pretty new installation, and this week tried to add a vlc server application.

My linux knowledge is fairly limited. Thanks!\n\nA: Two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*You tried to fetch http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/trusty.list, and made a typo to http://www.mediabuntu.org/sources.list.d/trusty.list. The program (or the ISP) you used to obtain it saw that this domain doesn't exist, and sent you down a DNS Search website. It's more likely to be your ISP, since the website says Time Warner Cable. This created an HTML file, which caused the syntax errors. Note that www.medibuntu.org doesn't exist either, which brings me to:\n\n*Medibuntu is dead: The Medibuntu Project has come to an end - what do I do now? In most cases, you don't need it anymore, and are better off installing packages from the official repos.\n\n\nFor the moment, delete the Medibuntu source:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mediabuntu.list\n\n", "Q: ACL's ownership, permissions Problem: Whenever I write a new file/modify a file in my www folder, permissions and ownerships are being reset on that file, sometimes making the server unable to read the files I create. So I need to go to the terminal, set the ownerships etc. which is very tedious.   \nMy www folder is accessible through Samba.\nWhenever I write or modify anything to that folder I get the permissions and ownership of the file reset to jay:jay that can't be read by apache.  \nI looked up online and saw this question. So I tried:  \nsudo setfacl -Rdm g:apache:rx www\nsudo chmod g+s www\n\nnow the result is this:\ndrwxr-sr-x+ 14 jay apache  4096 Aug 15 21:09 www\n\nBut now whenever I try something like: \ntouch somefile.txt\n\nI get these settings:\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 jay apache 0 Aug 15 23:07 somefile.txt\n\nI thought the permissions would keep the folder's permission, no? \nregarding the ownership it is ok, but the permissions are not kept!\n\n\n*\n\n*Say I wanted to make a 750 chmod automatic for jay's writing to the folder. How would I go about that? \n\n*I assume the little 's' marks the setgid? Does this mean anything written inside of this folder would be given the folder's group's ownership?\n\n*Why doesn't it affect my files? I thought the settings of a newly created file would be just like the containing folder's (www) which is rwxr-xr-x \n\n*Is there a way to simply undo the setfacl? That is take out the little '+' in the permissions line?\nI am running Ubuntu 12\n\nA: *\n\n*One way would be to set the umask value to 0022 for jay. What is \"umask\" and how does it work? You can also set the umask in Samba's configuration. See How to force group ownership on samba share? for an example.\n\n*It does indeed stand for setgid. In a setgid folder, files and folders created inherit the group ownership, and folders inherit the setgid bit.\n\n*Settings of newly created files are set using the umask of the user.\n\n*To reset the ACL, the best way would be to use the original ACL as given by getfacl, since setfacl has  --restore option. Failing that, you could try to remove all extended ACLs using setfacl -b.\n\n\nRegarding sudo and umask:\nAccording to the Arch Wiki:\n\nSudo will union the user's umask value with its own umask (which defaults to 0022).\n\nThis should be fine (since the user's umask is 0022 as well).\n", "Q: need to connect as **root@my-server-ip** with SSH I have a VPS with Ubuntu 14.04. I need to login as root to my server over SSH.\nI set a password for root: sudo passwd root\nthen enabled it: sudo passwd -u root\nthen rebooted my vps: sudo reboot\nBut I still can't connect with the root user. How can i enable ssh login as root?\n\nA: The default on Ubuntu 14.04 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config is\nPermitRootLogin without-password\n\nwhich forbids root logins using password authentication.  This is a good idea because brute-force login attempts against the root user are extremely common.\nTo login as root, I recommend setting up key-based SSH login.  Another (dangerous!) possibility is to change the option to PermitRootLogin yes.\n\nA: This doesn't answer the question directly, but if your intent is simply to administer your machine remotely, it is generally considered preferable and safer to log in as a non-root user, then elevate your privileges once you have started a session on the server. \nIn other words, instead of using ssh root@yourserver, you may wish to log in as yourself (your own distinct username and account) then run sudo bash or even su and to authenticate as root once logged in.   You can also prepend most commands with sudo to have that command run with root's privilege level, e.g.,: \nsudo cp /etc/configthing.conf /etc/configthing.conf.orig or\nsudo rm -i /var/log/syslog.3.gz\n\nA: If you insist on having to log in as root, I'd suggest logging in as a normal user, running\nsudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log\n\nand then (without closing that session), trying to log in as root via SSH and observe the authentication error messages appearing in the first session.\nYou should be able to figure out the reason you're unable to log in as root from there, otherwise posting /etc/ssh/sshd_config might get you an answer more quickly.\n\nA: There are many examples online so I will not repeat them.\nThe one thing they do not say is you need:\nssh-add [path_to_key]\n\nwhen using a custom name (not default) for the key.\nIf you insist on only using a password not a public-private key pair:\nssh root@server-ip-or-hostname\n\nand type your pass.\n", "Q: Can I use wired Xbox One controller Can I use wired Xbox One controller?

The sound is fine. I'm mainly using Chrome, which has the latest Flash enabled. The same issue occurs in Firefox.\nWhen I use Chrome (synched) in my XP partition all video is good and plays normally.\nI'm on a Dell 620M with Intel Core 2, 1.83GHz, Ubuntu 14.04 (new user of Linux); 2GB memory, 66GB Ubuntu partition.

Then after booting the next day the issue reappeared. At no stage has the choppiness of videos on Firefox improved.

If you receive a line like /bin/ntfsfix, this means that the tool is already installed and can be used to fix the problem. This should be the case.\n\n*Fixing a problem like the one you describe requires special rights a normal user doesn't have (for good reasons). Consequently, the repair operation has to be carried ot with super user priviledges. This is achieved by prefixing the command you want to use with sudo, which means super user do.\n\n*Since the external hard drive was not mounted, you need to call it by its device name. From the error message that you gave, we read that it is /dev/sdb1.\n\n*To sum it up: Enter sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdb1 in the terminal and press RETURN. You will be asked for your password. Enter that and press RETURN again.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Determining the effective file permissions I would like to ask what are the rules that Linux OS's are using on ext4 file systems when there are conflicts between directory permission and file permissions.\nExample:\n drwxrwx--- user1 group2 FOLDER\n -rw-r--r-- user1 group1 FILE\n\nWhat permissions a user in a group2 on a file FILE would have?...And what is the general rule for determining file permissions in this situations?\nThanks.\n\nA: If a user is in group2, then they'd follow the group permissions for the directory FOLDER. i.e.\nrwx\n\nPresuming that they are not user1 and also not in group1, then we'd look at the \"other\" permissions for FILE. i.e.\nr--\n\nHence, they only have read permissions for this file. Note that this is a bit confusing. They cannot directly modify this file, since don't have write privileges. However, since they have wx for the directory, they could rm this file, then replace it with a new one. (N.B. the inode would probably change, and they wouldn't be able to chown it to the original owner, so it's not exactly the same as directly modifying the file.)\nSo in general, the permissions inherit from the most-parent directory. As permissions get more restrictive, they restrict the children files and directories. However, as above, if you have wx permissions to the top-level directory, there are workarounds.\n\nEDIT\nSimilarly, if you edit the file with vim, then you'll see a change in inode. It's not \"editing\" it, but \"over-writing\" it.\n$ echo foo > file\n$ ls -li file \n5213942 -rw-r--r-- 1 sparhawk sparhawk 4 Aug 16 15:34 file\n$ sudo chown root:root file\n$ ls -li file \n5213942 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4 Aug 16 15:34 file\n$ vim file\n$ ls -li file \n5214750 -rw-r--r-- 1 lee lee 7 Aug 16 15:35 file\n\nNote the change in inode after vim overwrites the file.

So, I have problems with nouveau preventing from sleep. I decided to go with the newer kernel than officially available. Should I install kernel from Mainline PPA (I do know it's not real PPA)? If I do, will my kernel be replaced when matching (or newer) kernel is officially released? What is the way to get that effect (being in sync with official repos)? \nUPDATE I would like not to go with completely automated newer kernel installation, like with ppa:kernel-ppa/ppa (I mean I don't want installed packages to be updated automatically).\n\nA: You're asking if you install an updated mainline kernel today, will this be replaced in future by official kernel if there is a release with kernel version greater than this mainline kernel?\nThe answer is NO. Because each kernel is packaged independently and kernel's version number is part of the package name. That is why you can run multiple kernels in the same system. So, when I install kernel-3.23, It won't be replaced when kernel-3.24 is available in update path. I have to manually install the later/updated one.\nBut Ubuntu partially handles this problem by using an empty linux-image-generic package. This package's description says\n\nThis package will always depend on the latest generic kernel image\n   available.\n\nSo, when you update this package, this will bring newer 3-24 kernel in my system. But the older one will still be there. And those will accumulate until you removed them manually. That's why so many people have insufficient space problem in /boot.\nThis is true only for Ubuntu maintained generic kernel only. Mainline kernels don't even have this kind of upgrade mechanism. So, You're the person responsible for maintaining the versions.\n\nA: *\n\n*Add PPA:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kernel-ppa/ppa\n\n*It will asks you for password, so type the password and hit Enter.\n\n*Now you need to type the following command: sudo apt-get update.\n\n*Type the following command to check did you add Kernel properly: apt-cache showpkg linux-headers and hit Enter. \n\n*On the list in the Terminal will be appear latest kernel version if you have add the properly commands.  \n\n*Finally, type the following command  to update your Kernel: sudo apt-get install (WRITE headers from step 5) --fix-missing .\n\n*Reboot\n\nA: Okay, I think that if I install mainline kernel it will be \"updated\" once the newer official one gets released, but only because grub will be updated. So there always be one additional kernel in the system, but I can live with that for now.\n", "Q: how to install rastertospl in my usr/lib/cups/filter? For installing my Samsung ML  -1676 Printer on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS how should I add filter rastertospl on my usr/lib/cups/filter folder?\n\nA: The archive for the Linux driver contains a uld directory. This directory contains the install.sh file and three directories: arm, i386, and x86_64. These directories contain the rastertospl files for different architectures. You should copy the one for your architecture in the /usr/lib/cups/filter. Make the copy as root user, or you will get a permission error (from shell, use sudo.)\n\nA: The problem happens when you install the printer from a PPD file without using the full installer for Unified Linux Driver obtained from Samsung website. \nrastertospl is not part of any standard apt package, you need to download \n it from https://support.hp.com (as of 2019.09.02) or use https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/. \n\nA: You can go to the terminal and run :\nsudo sh /home/yourusername/WhereverYourArchiveIs/install.sh\n\nAfter downloading the drivers from the web, and selecting manually the .ppd file, you can go to the terminal and insert the command said before, just run the sh \"install.sh\", found at the main folder of the ULD driver folder, as SUDO, and then you can use the printer.\nIf this doesn't solve your problem, go and copy the \"rastertospl\" file, which is found at i386 folder (if you are x32 system) or at x86_64 (if you are x64 system), to the location \"usr/lib/cups/filter\" and then run the command.\nThat's all.\n\nA: To paste the file rastertospl in the folder \\usr\\lib\\cups\\filter you need to do this as root, otherwise the permission will be denied. Do this by right clicking on the folder filter and clicking on \"Open as Root\". You will notice a red stripe with Elevated Privileges written on it. Now you can paste the file rastertospl into the folder \\usr\\lib\\cups\\filter. \n\nA: The first answer was incomplete.

Moreover it looks like it is dependant of particular USB stick too. I tried with standard Ubuntu:\n$ sudo dd if=./ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdd bs=8129\nAnd it works like charm, I mean: boot and installs or run live Ubuntu. But when I use another USB stick prepared the same way, it fails to boot with Operating system not found BIOS error.\nWhen I try the Ubuntu GNOME, then it simply does not boot with the same error as in previous example, regardless of which one USB stick I use.\nI know, that there is Startup Disk Creator application in Ubuntu, but I have been convinced, that it is only a GUI facade for simple dd command, and I can always use dd to create bootable USB stick, at least for Linux. Am I wrong?\n\nA: If you run Startup Disk Creator, you'll notice that it does three (four) things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the drive\n\n*Copy over the data from the ISO to the drive\n\n*(Add an extra casper1 file for persistence, if selected. dd does not give you persistence.)\n\n*Install a bootloader\n\n\nIt is not a GUI for dd (there are GUIs for dd, but SDC is not one of those).\nYou can think of it as doing equivalent of Arch Linux's or Gentoo's manual methods. You should be able to create a bootable USB using most (reasonably popular) distros' installation ISOs at present. This was not true about three or four years ago, when I looked at Arch. It was only 2010 that all Arch ISOs gained this feature (where you could write it directly to a USB drive) - from 2008 to 2010 they had special USB images.\nFurther, if you dd a drive directly, that drive is effectively read-only until you format it or use the remaining space somehow. A SCD-created disk is still usable as a USB drive, even though the contents are are not accessible from the live environment easily. So if you dd a 1GB ISO to a 8 or 16 GB USB drive, you're effectively abandoning the remaining space unless extra steps are taken.\n\n1Typically, most live images use a SquashFS file for the root partition. SquashFS is read-only, so for persistence, a casper-rw file is created in /casper. I am not sure of the origins of casper. From what I understand, when booted with the boot=casper option, the kernel overlays the casper file (creating one if none exists) on top of the squashfs, so that it gains write capability. casper doesn't have to be a file, it can also be a partition.\n\nA: try first: \nsu -c 'mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc -I'\n\nTo make bootable usb disk from iso file using dd command, disk can't have partitions like /dev/sdc1(one from four possible primary partitions of disk /dev/sdc ). You can't clone blocks of iso file to primary partition, becouse dvd or cd disc doesn't have it too. That's why you have to create a filesystem exactly on the disk /dev/sdc, not in the partition primary.\nIn addition you made few mistakes by typing dd command. \nTry this:\nsu -c 'dd if=/home/user/debian.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=4M;sync;eject /dev/sdc'\n\nyour command doesn't correct without mkfs.vfat first. can be if you install bootloader too and make partition active. Other usb drives don't works maybe becouse your usb port can be shared with another your usb port or you don't have power for working live usb OS, probably working hdd drive and other usb disk what needs more power than usual. Than the average power consumption of this type of devices(like hdd disks in external case with usb from sata adapter)      \n\nA: You can even create a bootable USB stick with cp (it seems much more straightforward for me than dd or a GUI):\nsudo cp path/to/ISO /dev/sdX\n\nRemember that /dev/sdX should be replaced with the name of your block device (e.g. /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc).\n", "Q: Can't Run Ubuntu SDK Apps in Emulator \nUbuntu 14.04.1Qt Creator 3.1.1Ubuntu Touch: Image version 189 & 179\n\nI recently upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 LTS (with Ubuntu SDK installed, and I did re-enable the ubuntu-sdk repository) and finally able to get the Ubuntu emulator working.

Maybe You can try just this one first):\n$ sudo ubuntu-emulator create UbuntuTouch --arch=i386 --channel=ubuntu-touch/utopic-proposed\n\nNow I can run apps on this emulator from the QtCreator, and I get a green status icon for this emulator instead of orange!\nHope this helps! :D\n", "Q: Partition Mounting Problem I have a NTFS partition called DATA which automatically mount at boot (on /media/DATA).

How can I remount my partition on /media/DATA and not on /media/DATA_ anymore?  \n\nA: It seems like previously created DATA folder existed when you boot up your machine so the system created a new one. I think you can delete the old one and after reboot - it should be mounted as DATA again.\nsudo rmdir /media/DATA\nreboot\nif it works then I would expect DATA_ empty this time, so lastly you can delete it too:\nsudo rmdir /media/DATA_\n", "Q: installing synaptic package manager from outside the repos I have been facing some problems in installing software with ubuntu software center, due to the fact that I have not been able to run no proxy for the whole system, I have tried all methods prescribed in various websites to do the same but i always get 407  Proxy Authentication Required.

When it opens, navigate to where the file was downloaded, probably the Downloads folder, and run the command(s) below:\nsudo dpkg -i <package_name>.deb\n\nClick for 32bit, and 64bit depending on your architecture.

When I use sudo apt-get install python3, it says that my python is 'already the newest version'. However, 3.4 is the latest.\nHow would I upgrade my current Python to 3.4?\n\nA: As you noticed, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ships with python3 3.2.3. If you need Python 3, then I suggest to upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS which includes python3 3.4.1.\nIf you cannot do that, consider something like virtualenv.\n\nA: You can build from source. Download the tarball from the Python-site.\n$tar xvf Python-4.3.1.tgz\n$cd Python-4.3.1\n$less README\n\nAnd follow the instructions. You will then have two different installations of python so by just entering $python -v you will invoke the old python version.

How do I djvubind only files that are in ls | grep -P \"page\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d.tif\"?\n\nA: Hurried readers can skip down to Putting Everything Together and read just that section--but for users new to the topic I suggest starting from the beginning.\nBasic Principles\nRunning djvubind so it only uses files named pageNNN.tif (where each N is some digit) is in one way significantly more complicated than you might be thinking, while in another way is a bit less complicated.\n\n\n*\n\n*Passing the names of just the desired .tif files to the djvubind command will not work, because djvubind takes a directory as its argument, and insists on trying to use all the files directly contained in that directory.\nOne way to get around this is to build another directory of hard links pointing to files in the directory you started with, running djvubind on that directory, then (optionally) removing it. I will present that method in this answer.\nNormally, for this sort of thing, symbolic links would be preferred to hard links. However, djvubind apparently skips over symbolic links automatically, refusing to process the files they point to. (There doesn't seem to be any option to change this behavior, but if someone knows of a way, I--or they--can edit this answer.)\n\n*But it is less complicated in that you do not need to invoke ls or even grep.\nExcept for some rare situations where the only goal is to show a directory listing to the user, it is generally best to avoid parsing the output of ls. And while grep certainly may be used for this purpose, your approach has the disadvantage of selecting some files with quite different names, like rampage999.tiffany's.revenge.mp3. (You could fix that by passing grep the -x flag, but really you don't need grep at all for this.)\nSelecting the Desired Files\nThere are two especially popular methods for selecting files that match a particular pattern:\n\n\n*\n\n*shell globbing and a for loop\n\n*the find command (which accepts similar globbing syntax)\n\n\nI'll use the first way in this guide, and show the commands for the second way at the end.\nFirst, I suggest composing and trying out a command just to show the names of the files we want to operate on. This is to help avoid mistakes--you'll see if you're selecting the files correctly or not. To do this, you can run printf '%s\\n' filename for each one. (For the real thing, you'll replace printf '%s\\n' with a different command.)\nfor x in page[0-9][0-9][0-9].tif; do printf '%s\\n' \"$x\"; done\n\nNote that the glob (page[0-9][0-9][0-9].tif) is unquoted, as the shell must expand it, then loop through the expanded list. (Testing will look something like this, though your output will be longer if you have many files. You should be able to see how only the correct files are selected.)\nPutting Everything Together\nNow for the real thing. Make a directory to store the hard links:\nmkdir page-links\n\nPopulate the new directory with hard links to the desired files:\nfor x in page[0-9][0-9][0-9].tif; do ln \"$x\" \"page-links/$x\"; done\n\nRun djvubind on the newly populated page-links directory:\ndjvubind page-links\n\nOptionally, remove the directory of hard links:\nrm -r page-links\n\nIt will look something like this.\nIf you prefer find...\nTo use find instead of shell globbing and a for loop:\n\n\n*\n\n*use -mindepth 1 to prevent the containing directory from being considered as a possible match,\n\n*use -maxdepth 1 so that only files directly contained in the current directory (not those in its subdirectories) are matched, and\n\n*do quote the pattern, as it must be passed unexpanded by the shell to the find command (which then performs the matching).\n\n\nList the files:\nfind . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -name 'page[0-9][0-9][0-9].tif'\n\nWithout specifying any action, the default -print action is used, listing the files you have selected. Results will be preceded by ./, but that won't cause any problems here.\nAfter creating the target directory (mkdir page-links), populate it:\nfind . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -name 'page[0-9][0-9][0-9].tif' -exec ln {} page-links/{} \\;\n\nYou don't have to quote {}, though some people like to do so because it clarifies (to humans) that it is not a brace expansion, and perhaps it is necessary to do so when invoking find from some non-Bourne-style shells, if they use different brace expansion syntax. Note that, whether or not you quote it, find will behave the same--including for files with spaces in their names. (find never sees the quotes, as they are removed by the shell before find runs. The misconception that quoting {} has something to do with the way find's -exec action passes filenames to commands is why I don't quote it.)\nAfter that, running djvubind (and optionally removing the page-links directory afterwards) will of course work exactly the same way.\n", "Q: Connecting PS3 dualshock on Ubuntu 14.04 with 3.13.0-34-generic?

The documentation states that this is normal and that dnsmasq will handle it correctly. I just don't know how to configure this in a lasting manner.\n\nA: resolvconf generates /etc/resolv.conf using files from /etc/resolvconf/resolvconf.d/, which usually contains a head, a base and maybe a tail. From the manpage:\n   The dynamically generated resolver  configuration  file  always  starts\n   with  the  contents of /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head and ends with\n   the contents of /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail.  Between  head  and\n   tail  the  libc  script inserts dynamic nameserver information compiled\n   from, first, information provided for  configured  interfaces;  second,\n   static  information  from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base.\n\nAs you may have observed, the generated /etc/resolv.conf has a header warning that the contents are generated and the file should not be edited manually. This header is stored in /etc/resolvconf/resolvconf.d/head, so don't be confused by the presence of that warning in head. Files in /etc/resolvconf/resolvconf.d are not generated, and are meant for manualy editing if needed. So if any entries absolutely have to appear\nat the top of resolv.conf, add them to head. If the entries absolutely have to appear at the end (for example, the last search entry is always used), add them in tail.\n", "Q: Installed Metasploit but it's not working!

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and although I would like to upgrade to 14.04 LTS, I don't want to have any troubles after upgrading. For example, I don't know if I can no longer use some of my software and have to reinstall it.\nI'm also worry if my computer have the system requirements necessary to 14.04 LTS version.\nThat's why I'm asking if it is necessary to upgrade, I mean, will be any problem if I skip the upgrade? Can I stand in 12.04 LTS forever?\n\nA: Until about April 2017, yes: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases. LTS releases are supported for 5 years. However, the longer you stick with Ubuntu 12.04, the harder it will be to migrate. Things may have changed drastically in 5 years (just compare 8.04 and 12.04). I recommend that you upgrade next year, when 15.04 is out. A year's time should be enough for you to check on compatibility, and barring proprietary drivers and associated problems, 14.04 will run on most about anything that can run 12.04.\n\nA: You can technically stay in any release forever. However, eventually, every release becomes EOL (End of Life) which means they will no longer receive official updates. This will put your system at increased risk, as they will no longer have security updates, and all of your software will become out of date.\nYou can stay with 12.04 for 5 years from the release, as all LTS releases have a life-cycle of 5 years as opposed to the new 9-month life-cycle of the non-LTS releases, and still receive updates. Read here for more info.\nThis puts you at being able to use 12.04 securely and in an up-to-date manner until around April 2017.\n\nA: If hard disk space is not a problem , install 14.04 alongside 12.04. I had this same dilemma, I installed  14.04 alongside 12.04 and after a couple of days I completely moved to 14.04. You will almost find no difficulty in migrating, and 14.04 has lot of good improvements over 12.04 \nCouple of pointers if you are planning to install 14.04 alongside 12.04,\n\n\n*\n\n*Move your home folder to a seperate drive if it is not already in a seperate drive. There is a thorough guide on this here. And when installing 14.04, mention this drive as your home partition.\n\n*You might find a couple of pointers here on how you can backup your software installations. Be careful, when following these steps. In my opinion, it is safe to get the list of your 12.04 installations manually and reinstall them in 14.04. I ran into some problems when I tried dpkg --set-selections. So, I highly recommend you to gradually migrate by reinstalling all your 12.04 softwares manually in 14.04 even if it takes some time to do it.\n\n\nPS: When I was migrating I asked this question on how to backup my software installations. I was (and still am) confused on the doubts I raised in my above question, and I ended up manually installing all my 12.04 softwares in 14.04 based on the comments. \nPS1 Can someone clear on this doubt I raised in this question ? If I copy apt sources from one distribution to other (like from 12.04 to 14.04) and apt-get update is run, will the distribution code name be automatically replaced (like precise to 'trusty'). If yes, is it a safe way of backing up software installations ? \n\nA: I just attempted to install Winusb on 14.04 using the directions at Installing WinUSB on Ubuntu 14.04 and it didn't happen (with the terminal citing dependency issues).  Plus I've noticed that there are some Ubuntu themes that work okay on 12.04 but not on 14.04.\nHaving tried 12.04, 12.10, 13.04, 13.10, and 14.04 on bare metal (and 14.10 and 15.04 on live usb), I'm reinstalling 12.04. \n", "Q: Turn Monitor Back On after xrandr I keep my Laptop PC always connected to my HDMI tv. When I am watching a movie on the tv, i use the command xrandr --output LVDS1 --off to turn my laptop screen Off (it is annoying to see the movie on a small screen beside the Tv).\nSo, with this command, the Laptop Screen is Off, and everything is displayed in the TV\nThe question is: How do i Turn my Laptop Screen BACK ON? Right now, i have to remove the HDMI cable, then it turns on. I Would like to do it via Command Line. How????? \n\nA: When accidentally disabling the only attached display, trying to reenable it from another virtual console will yield in the following error message:  \n\nxrandr: Configure crtc 0 failed\n\nPlease make sure the actual virtual console where X Windows is running is active, when xrandr is actuating the configuration. Typing the following in the first virtual console rescued me:\n\nsudo chvt 7; sleep 3; xrandr --display :0.0 --auto\n\n\nA: xrandr --output LVDS1 --auto\n\ndid it\n\nA: xrandr --output LVDS-1 --right-of HDMI-1 --auto\n\nenables LVDS-1, putting it logically beyond right side of HDMI-1. The other two answers here copies the current display in both screens.\n", "Q: Alias to open multiple text files in different directories from terminal After hours of searching and trying different gedit plugins I did not manage to add a session saver to gedit to open some files in Ubuntu 14.04 (see here).  \nSo, I am trying to create a permanent bash alias, editing ~/.bashrc to add it.  \nThe alias is: \nalias a=\"\n         cd /home/konstantinosubuntu/Desktop/abc && gedit test1.c\n      && cd /home/konstantinosubuntu/Desktop/xyz && gedit test2.c\"\n\nThen I use . ~/.bashrc to reload the changes I made to the aliases.\nBut this alias only opens the first file (here, test1.c) and if I interchange the lines 2 and 3 it opens test2.c. That means there is no problem with the path. Instead, the error I get is at the second && which is bash: syntax error near unexpected token `&&'. Why is this error appearing? What alias should I use to open multiple files at once?\n\nA: On how to write this alias:\nThe alias does not need to open the files separately - gedit can take multiple files.\nalias a=\"gedit ~/Desktop/abc/test1.c ~/Desktop/xyz/test2.c\"\nThis also replaces the path of your home directory by ~. If it should work for other users, use ~konstantinosubuntu instead of the ~.\nTo make the command independent of the terminal, so that it keeps running if you close the terminal, you can add & to run it in the background, and nohup to make it not exit when the terminal closes:\nalias a=\"nohup gedit ~/Desktop/abc/test1.c ~/Desktop/xyz/test2.c &\"\n\nOn the syntax of your example: \nThe problem with the && is that the && needs to be put at the end of the previous line. Otherwise the end of the line is just the end of the command - no problem so far - and the start of the next line has a \"&&\" that makes no sense in this place.  \nalias a=\"\n         cd /home/konstantinosubuntu/Desktop/abc && gedit test1.c &&\n         cd /home/konstantinosubuntu/Desktop/xyz && gedit test2.c\"\n\nAs alternative, the whole alias could be put in one line. Or, very similar, a line continuation with \\ at the end of the line could be used. That would be writing it as two lines, but executing it as one line, logically. \nYou note in your comments that the first gedit needs to be closed before the second file is opended, and that you do not want this. The command gedit file.txt runs gedit in foreground if it's the first instance. If gedit is already running, it opens a new tab in that instance, and exits. To make the alias open both files in gedit at the same time, run the first instance in background with &. That does not work together with &&, that needs to be removed:\nalias a=\"\n         cd /home/konstantinosubuntu/Desktop/abc && gedit test1.c &\n         cd /home/konstantinosubuntu/Desktop/xyz && gedit test2.c\"\n\n(Interesting how it is only different by one character, but very different in meaning.)\nIn case you intended to have multiple current working directories in some way associated with the running gedit by using the cd commands, that can not work. A process has exactly one current working directory. It will be the one of the first gedit instance here.\n\nJust to be clear after discussing these examples, I think you should better use something like in the first section, opening one gedit with multiple files at once.\n", "Q: Why doesn't umask work as expected? Please, can someone explain this to me?\nI set:  \numask 000\ntouch afile.tmp\n\nresult:\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 jay apache 0 Aug 16 18:11 afile.tmp\n\nI was expecting this:\n-rw-rw-rw-\n\nto be like this:\n-rwxrwxrwx\n\nWhy isn't umask setting the 'x'`s  of the permissions for new file modifications?\n\nA: umask is working precisely as expected - a mask of 0000 means permissions are 666 (rw-rw-rw-) for files and 777 (rwxrwxrwx) for directories. The execute bit is set for directories and not files. Case in point: the default umask is 0022, but files you create don't have the execute bit set by default, do they?\n", "Q: Error creating partition I am trying to create a new partition in a free slot of an hard drive using the Gnome Disk utility (on 14.04).

And can it be solved?\nEdit: A screen capture detailing the structure of this particular hard drive, with the partition at cause selected:\n\n\nA: I was trying to create an encrypted partition in that unallocated space following these instructions at the Wiki, this being the reason why I was using the Disk Utility. But it was returning the error above, even when instructed to create a non-ecrypted partition (ext4).\nEven though GParted seems to lack this functionality it succeeded in creating a non-encrypted partition in the allocated space. After that the Disk Utility itself was able to encrypt the partition. In all likelihood the Disk Utility version shipped with Ubuntu 14.04 has a bug that prevents it from creating new partitions. \nThe detailed steps were:\n\n\n*\n\n*In GParted select the unallocated space and select New, give it a label in the menu the opens and click Add.\n\n*Click Apply all Operations and wait for the process to finish.\n\n*Open the Disk Utility, select the newly created partition and click More Actions (the little icon with cogs) and then Format....\n\n*In the menu that opens select \"Encrypted, compatible with Linux systems (LUKS + Ext4)\" in the Type drop down; create a Passphrase and click Format....\n", "Q: There is how to change workspace only of the primary monitor? I've two screens and I'm using Unity Interface. In GNOME shell we're able to change the workspace of just the primary, what make sense for me.

I’ve heard that wine can install window viruses if rooted. How can I tell if my wine is rooted? \n\nA: Wine by default runs programs as admin within itself, but wine can even be broken by trying to run it as root. Never run it as root. To tell if it is \"rooted\" just see what command you use to launch it. If it includes \"sudo\" or \"gksudo\" or even \"kdesudo\" you are running it as root. Wine is subject to viruses in the same way a non admin windows account can be.

Actually for fear that it would break zfs (or I would break it).   I am bascially slightly better than novice at linux. \nSpent the last couple of hours trying to get the pool back.  Now I am at the stage where I don't think I have a complete failure, but I am worried that I may break it.  So if could help me not break it, and recover it,  I would be thankful.\nMy zfs is file storage and not boot.\nIt was working fine for a year and was working perfectly before the upgrade (scrub and everything was fine).  I was confident that the upgrade would work (or at least I could fix it) because I had upgraded once in the past, the pool went missing, but I was able to get it back. \nI have reinstalled zfs, zfs utilities, and some dependencies (after searching this forum) \nI think what happened is 14.04 deleted some config file, or specified disk names differntly, but I could be wrong.  When I set the pool up originally, I was using specific device Ids as I recall (because I did not want to break things if they got reassigned at boot)\nSo see if this helps.\nI can confirm that old mountpoint folders  are there but empty.\nno talloc stackframe at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory\n\npool: naspool1\n state: UNAVAIL\nstatus: One or more devices could not be used because the label is missing \n    or invalid.

I'm thinking the update deleted some zfs config files.  It seems like the pool exists and certainly 3 perfectly working disks did not fail at once.  I am worried that I may break something without a little bit of guideance.\nThanks.\n\nA: The problem is that after the upgrade zfs thinks that this is a different server. You should be able to fix it by simply exporting and then importing the pool.\nsudo zpool export naspool1\nsudo zpool import naspool1\n\nMost likely the import will complain that the \"pool may be in use by another system, use -f to import it anyway\". Use -f to do the import:\nsudo zpool import naspool1 -f\n\n", "Q: How can i install peerguardian? I tried to install PeerGuardian and expected it to be a simple run and install... but its a tar.gz!

It isn't a duplicate - there is almost nothing about the system monitor on the internet, never mind just here.\n\n\nApologies if it is too broad, suggestions as to how to make it better are appreciated!\n\nA: This is a topic that is very sparse, not just here but in general on the internet. Please take any section of this to use in an answer - but a link back is appreciated :-)\nProcesses Tab\nProcess Name\n\nThe process name is the name of the process. Multiple processes can have the same name, but different process IDs. This is useful, as it means if you want to get rid of all your nautilus windows, you can execute a simple command:\npkill nautilus\n\nand they will all be killed.\nIt can be sorted Alphabetically A-Z or Z-A.\n\nUser\n\nThis is the user that owns the task. By default, you can only see your own processes. To see those run by other users, click View (top, right hand corner) and then All Processes. Then it will show those owned by other users, including root.\nIt can be sorted Alphabetically A-Z or Z-A.\n\n% CPU\n\nThis shows the % of CPU being used by that process. By default it is divided by the CPU count (meaning if you have a dual core, and one process is using 100% of a single CPU, it will show up as 25%).\n\nID\n\nThe ID field shows the identification number of the process. This is a unique number for each process and the only way of identifying identically named processes reliably. This is useful when you want to kill a specific process, but it has others with the same name:\n\nThe process identifier (normally referred to as the PID) is a number used by most operating system to temporarily identify a process. This number may be used in a command, allowing processes to be manipulated, such as killing it altogether.\n\n\nMemory\n\nThis is the amount of RAM  being used by that process.\nIt is always rounded to 1 decimal place, but the units vary.  If it is less than 1 GiB (1024 MiB) it displays in MiB. If it is less than 1 MiB (1024 KiB) it displays in KiB. Because of this, you never see 0.5MiB of RAM, it is always 500 KiB.\n\nPriority\nThis displays the priority of the app - how much CPU it is allowed to use compared to other processes. There are 5 options - Very Low, Low, Normal, High, Very High.\n\nAn app running with higher priority gets more access to cpu time as compared to an app running with low priority. This is primarily used to keep an app (like the Arista transcoder) from eating all of the cpu time and slowing the system to a crawl, OR, for allowing one app to suck up as much CPU as it can regardless of the consequences.\n\nSource\n\nStatus\n\nThis will either be Sleeping or Running. Most of mine are sleeping.\n\nVirtual Memory\n\n\nVirtual memory is a memory management technique that is implemented using both hardware and software. It maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory.\n\nSource\nThis shows how much is being used by each process.\n\nResident Memory\nThis relates to physical memory.\n\n\nShared Memory\nAmount of memory assigned to multiple processes.\n\n\nStarted\n\nThis is simply the time   date started. This can be useful for seeing when you started an application, but also when you booted your machine up - if you sort it, typically there will be a whole load with an identical time at the top. That is pretty close to the time you turned it on (for this to be precise for the start up time, you have to have enabled See All Processes).\nThis can be sorted from Most recent to Oldest and Oldest to Most recent.\n\nNice\n\nThis is simply the Priority, expressed in a numerical format. It has more precise control over it (-20 to 19 has 40 options, where as Very How to Very High has 5).\n\n'nice' refers to the priority the process gets on your CPU. This is a number in the range of -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest). You'll probably find that most applications you're running are at nice '0', which means that they are running with normal priority and none will get preferential treatment by the scheduler over another.\n\nSource\n\nCommand Line\n\nThis is the command that is run to start the application. Typically it will display the path to the executabe file.\nFor example my processes named Chrome were all launched with\n/opt/google/chrome/chrome --[someoptions]\n\nWaiting Channel\n\nThe waiting channel is the place in the Kernel where the task is currently waiting. A task has to wait for resources, which can be data or processing time. Those include network sockets, hardware, files, and so on; since most of them are just files, in Unix-like systems.\n\nSource\nWhat is the \"Waiting Channel\" of a process?\n\nControl Group\nGoogle doesn't know, and this is completely blank for me so...?\n\nPreferences Window - Processes\n\nThis is the preferences window on the processes tab. It has 2 main sections, Behaviour and Information Fields (Columns)\n\nUpdate interval.\nThis sets how often it refreshes the data. It can be anything from 1 to 100, and it is in seconds. If you enter more than 100, it goes to 100, and less than 1 goes to 1. You can also chose a decimal, to 2 decimal places. It seems to allow any decimal (i.e. 1.32 doesn't change to 1.25)\n\nEnable Smooth Refresh\nI can't see any difference, however it may be to do with the animation of the processes, i.e. they slide, rather than jump?\n\nAlert before ending or killing a process.\nWhen enabled, when you try to end a process, this dialogue is triggered, to prevent accidental termination.\n\n\nDivide CPU usage by CPU count.\nThis affects the % CPU field. When this is enabled, if you have a dual core, and one process is using 100% of a single CPU, it will show up as 25%. When disabled, it will show up as 100%.\nThis also affects the CPU graph on the Resources tab.\n\nInformation Fields\nWith this you can select which fields to be shown. By default only Process Name, User, %CPU, ID, Memory and Priority are shown.\n\nResources Tab\nCPU History\n\nThis will show you the percentage of processing power being used right now, and for the last X seconds, per processor. The amount of time is shows for is dependant on the refresh rate. Each line displayed is one of your CPUs (if you have a Multi-core Processor). Each core has it's own trace.\nBelow the graph are boxes. They are coloured the same as the graph lines. The number of boxes corresponds to the number of processors you have. Clicking one will bring up a colour selection window. There are some default colours, and you can create a custom one. Next to each box is the percentage of that processor that is being used.\nThe top of the graph will always be 100%\n\nMemory and Swap History.\n\nThis will show you the percentage of memory and swap being used now, and for the last X seconds. The amount of time is shows for is dependant on the refresh rate. A line is displayed for the Memory (Purple - AB1852 by default) and Swap (Green - 49A835).\nBelow the graph are segmented circles. The amount filed corresponds to the amount used. They are coloured the same as the graph lines. Clicking one will bring up a colour selection window. There are some default colours, and you can create a custom one. Next to each cirlce is the percentage of that resource that is currently being used. The centre of the circle is always coloured in, even if it is 0%.\nThe top of the graph will always be 100%\n\nNetwork History\n\nThis will show you the amount of data uploading and downloading right now, and for the last X seconds. The amount of time is shows for is dependant on the refresh rate. A line is displayed for the Receiving / Download (Purple - 2D7DB3 by default) and Sending / Upload (Green - EE1D00).\nBelow the graph are arrows. They are coloured the same as the graph lines. Clicking one will bring up a colour selection window. There are some default colours, and you can create a custom one. Next to each arrow is the amount being uploaded / downloaded right now. This can be used as a pretty accurate download speed tester. I normally run apt-get update to get a good measure. And below that is thr total Downloaded / Uploaded since the last restart.\nThe top of the graph will vary, from 10 KiB/s to 5 GiB/s, and the lines will never exceed it (unless they are higher than 5 GiB, which does happen when you disable and renable wired internet soemtimes. Instead, the top of the graph will increae, and the graph will be scaled apropriatly). The base is always 0 which means that if you have fast internet you can't see very accurately what it is (as the scale is large).\n\nPreferences Window - Resources\nThis is the preferences window on the resources tab. It only has 1 main section, Graphs.\n\n\nUpdate interval.\nThis sets how often it refreshes the data. It can be anything from 0.25 to 100, and it is in seconds. If you enter more than 100, it goes to 100, and less than 0.25 goes to 0.25. You can also chose a decimal, to 2 decimal places. It seems to allow any decimal (i.e. 1.32 doesn't change to 1.25).\nThis value is what determines X seconds (the amount of history displayed). The graph history can display at most 60 refreshes, so if you set it to refresh once every second, it will display history for the past 60 seconds - 60 refreshes. If however, you set it to refresh every 0.25 seconds, it will display history for the past 15 seconds - 60 refreshes. As a rule, it will display for updateinterval*60.\nThis value affects all the graphs.\n\nDraw CPU chart as stacked area chart.\nThis affects only the CPU graph. It will change it from the line graph formatting to a filled area graph. I don't see the point, but someone who doesn't get computers says that it \"Looks prettier\", so it does have a use - entertainment.\n\n\nShow network speed in bits.\nA lot of people don't realise the difference between bits and bytes.\n\nA bit is the basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.\n\nSource\n\nThe byte is a unit of digital information in computing and telecommunications that most commonly consists of eight bits.\n\nSource\nSo that means a 10 byte file is 80 bits. And a 1 KiB/s (1 kilobyte) internet connection is 8 Kbit/s (8 kilobits) (and useless). Because of this, you get a difference in how they are compared.\nIn reality, you have a MiB (Megabyte) connection, not a Mbit (Megabit). But, in order to make it look like more ISP normally advertise their speeds in Mbits. If we use my connection as an example - it is currently 680 KiB/s (which sounds quite bad, and, to be honest it is). But in Bits, it is 5.31 MBits/s. That sounds much better! (To convert between the two, just times the Mbits/s measurement by 8, then convert between KiB/MiB if necessary with * or / by 1024.\nThis feature lets you switch between which one you want. Most speed tests are in Mbits, so this can help confirm that.\n\nFile Systems Tab\nThis tab simply displays all of your file systems and details about them.\n\nDevice\n\nThis is the name of the device. When it has no name it displays as the mount point. So for example my HDD is called /dev/sda2\n\nDirectory\n\nThis is where the device can be accessed. So for example my HDD's Directory is /, and my external HDD is /media/tim/Big.\n\nType\n\nThis shows how it is formatted. So for example my HDD is formatted as EXT4 and my external HDD is fusebl (whatever that is).\n\nTotal\n\nThis shows the total size of the disk. So for example my HDD is 1.7 TB (Terrabytes - it used to 2 but it's been partitioned), and my external HDD is 500 GB.\n\nAvailable\n\nThis shows the amount of free space on the disk. So for example my HDD has 852 GB free, and my external HDD has 71 GB\n\nUsed\n\nThis shows the amount used, and a graphical percentage (a bar with the % on it). So for example my HDD has 736 GB (46%) used, and my external HDD has 429 8GB (85%).\n\nPreferences Window - File Systems\nThis has 2 sections, Behaviour and Information Fields.\n\n\nUpdate interval.\nThis sets how often it refreshes the data. It can be anything from 1 to 100, and it is in seconds. If you enter more than 100, it goes to 100, and less than 1 goes to 1. You can also chose a decimal, to 2 decimal places. It seems to allow any decimal (i.e. 1.32 doesn't change to 1.25).\n\nShow all file systems\nWhen ticked this shows all file systems, not just the /dev/sd*X ones.\n\nInformation Fields\nWith this you can select which fields to be shown. By default all of them are shown.\n\nThat is a summary of all of the features of the software centre.\n", "Q: Peerguardian Error \"Could not use either kdesu(do) or gksu(do) to execute the command requested\" I installed PeerGuardian (thanks to a lot of help) and I get an error massage saying:\n\nCould not use either kdesu(do) or gksu(do) to execute the command requested.

OVERVIEW:\nMy professor runs some kind of live Ubuntu OS image on top of the classroom computer he uses to lecture then portals into his linux box located in his office. He has informed me his hostname and the OS he is running on his box which is Ubuntu. Somehow he has hardened his box through some NSA documentation. His IP address changes or is masked in some way as he has hinted.\nHe has challenged me to leave a message on his computer. Therefore, my tasks consist of finding his IP from the hostname he gave me, scan for open ports and figure which port he uses. He has informed me there is no password for the very reason of this challenge he gave me.\nENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:\nHostname:\nEpiphyte-ix\nNetwork:\nThere are three networks at our school. The administrative network, student network, experimental network. He is connected to the administrative network which, as being an IT student employee, I have access too. \nMy Computer:\nRunning Kali Linux\nTROUBLE I'M HAVING\nHe has hinted that his computer changes it's IP address once \"something\" expires. What exactly expires i don't know. I'm guessing it's some kind of DHCP service running on whatever port he is using. If I ask anything else he just chuckles and says he is still waiting for a message. \nI'm getting permission from my IT boss to nmap the whole admin network from my Kali system. I've tried a few commands already in looking up the hostname but not having any luck. Right now i'm putting a list of nmap commands and additional scans I could possibly do but since his IP address is changing I would like guidance.\nI would like some direction from you guys before i go on some ridiculous web search. I really have no idea where to start as I'm an electrical engineering student not a informations security or networking student. I do have a basic grasp on networking and i'm fairly efficient from the command line.   \nWANT I'M HOPING TO GET FROM THIS POST:\nnamp parameters that might hold a high potential in detecting his computer\nother reconnaissance tactics to gain more information on his IP address and system\nadditional directions that you might suggest I take \nIN CONCLUSION:\nThanks for any help/advice you might have for me. I may of posted a similar discussion on this topic here but cannot recall if I did. Therefore, if I did I apologize and did so in creating a better in detail description of my tasks and environment variables. \nNOTE:\nI may of misused a few words and phrases as i'm not a genius in networking vocabulary. These may be the following...\n1.)\n\"runs some kind of live Ubuntu OS image on top of the classroom computer\"\nI know for a fact he plugs in a hard drive of some kind and then portals into his linux box so i'm guessing this is some kind of live ISO image. I did my homework and researched his hostname \"epiphyte-ix\". Epiphyte is a plant that lives/grows on another plant so i'm guessing this applies as I hinted it to him and he replied \"very good\". \n2.)\n\"His IP addresss changes or is masked\"\nI asked if he hidden the linux box from the network in someway and he said \"its hard to detect\". He also informed me that his IP changes the minute something expires.         \n\nA: I'm not sure how evil he's being but here are a couple of stumbling blocks:\n\n\n*\n\n*A deliberately hidden computer will not respond to nmap. At all. It could  simply ignore any network activity from any host that hasn't registered the correct port knock. This is a fairly obscure technique that is effective nonetheless.\n\n*Dynamic IP/DHCP lease/etc can all be circumvented via external DNS. My computer tells Linode (a web host with DNS servers) my network's public IP so it resolves via a home.example.com domain name. He could be doing exactly the same with an internal IP.\nTracking down an intentionally hidden computer is likely going to require some serious man-in-the-middle network sniffing. I strongly suggest you avoid even asking the IT department about this.\n\nBut if he's playing fair and using a standard Ubuntu setup and is actually using the hostname that he's given you, you might have a fair chance.\nUbuntu uses Avahi to broadcast its mDNS/Bonjour/zero-conf local DNS. A simple ping Epiphyte-ix.local from another Ubuntu box should do it. Once you have that, a simple \nnmap <ip>\n\n... will scan ports 1-1024 and will likely find you your services.\nIf that fails, try nmap -p- <ip> to scan all 65535 ports.\nIf you get a service you don't recognise (and googling \"port ...\" doesn't work) you can always try connecting to it with telnet <ip> <port>. Some things might blurt a banner out. Some things won't.\nIf you only find a SSH server, he's probably tunnelling whatever remote desktop software over that. A common technique in untrusted networks.\n\nThe NSA document you mentioned is freely available to anybody. If he has mentioned it, perhaps there's a clue in there.\n", "Q: Minecraft crashes after a few minutes, freezes computer I have Ubuntu 14.04, 64-bit.

Disks utility not working It's either not intuitive or not working in Ubuntu 14.04.\nI want to mount my internal HDD at at startup (I boot from an SSD). I attempt to set this, following this procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disks utility\n\n*Select the disk\n\n*Below the disk's Volumes, click on the More actions button\n\n*Select Edit Mount Options...\n\n*Select Automatic Mount Options \"Off\"\n\n*Under Mount Options, ensure that Mount at startup is selected\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Enter password into Authenticate dialog box\n\n*Restart\n\n\nbut this procedure doesn't work.

I tried all the different Identify As options to no avail, as every reboot showed that it wasn't working correctly. \nWhat was happening was that the drive itself was mounting correctly, but all the bookmarks were broken (Folders with Yellow on the left panel), therefore I was lead to believe that the drive was not mounting at all.\n\nThen I realised my mistake and found out that when you select an Identify As option, it will set the the Mount Point to a default value (e.g. /mnt/[uu_id]). \n\nThis is not the mounting point I desired (e.g /media/[username]/[MountFolderName]) and it was incompatible with the bookmarks I have set on the Files Application.\nSo you need to set the Identify As option first, then set the Mount Point to your desired location.

I want to install php tidy in my installed sublime. So can someone tell me how to install php tidy. I am using sublime text for the first time so I don't know how to install plugins and repositories in it. So any help and suggestions will be really appreciable. Thanks\n\nA: To install plugins, also known as packages, you'll first need to install Package Control. Go to the ST3 installation page and follow the Simple Installation Instructions very carefully. I have not copied the installation code here, as it changes with different releases, however the link I gave should remain constant. Once you've pasted the code into your console and hit Enter, and you've received the confirmation message, quit Sublime completely, then restart it. Basic usage instructions are here. \n\nOK, this is the part where I'd usually tell you to open the Command Palette, find Package Control: Install Package, scroll through the list, pick PhpTidy, and install it easily. Unfortunately, due to the laziness of the author, we can't do it that way, as the Package Control database currently only lists the plugin as working with Sublime Text 2, even though it's been updated (nearly a year ago) to work with ST3. This means we can't install it the usual way. There's also a file in the repository that needs to be deleted, otherwise it may not work. This won't be too hard, so don't get scared, it's just a little command-line work.\nFirst, open up your favorite Terminal emulator. If you installed 14.04 with all the default options, you'll find a button on the top left of the icon toolbar that looks approximately like this:\n\nClick it, and type \"Terminal\" into the search box. The cleverly-named Terminal application should show up, and you can just click on it to open it. If you're a pro command-line user, I apologize for going through this step-by-step :)\nNB: For all the commands below, it would probably be better if you copied them from your web browser and pasted them into Terminal (CtrlShiftV is the shortcut) instead of trying to recreate them by hand. Even a single-letter mistake could really mess up the process.\nAt the command prompt, double-check and see if you have a utility called git installed, by typing\nwhich git\n\nand hitting Enter. If /usr/bin/git shows up, great, just skip to the next part. If nothing shows up, or you get a message about installing something, type this next:\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nand enter your admin user's password when prompted. This will install the utility we need for the next step.\nOK, git is installed. Next, type \ncd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages\n\nto change to that directory, which is where certain Sublime Text packages are stored. Then, enter\ngit clone https://github.com/welovewordpress/SublimePhpTidy.git PhpTidy\n\nto pull the plugin files from Github and place them on your computer in a new PhpTidy directory. Finally, type in\nrm -f PhpTidy/php_tidy.pyc\n\nto delete the file that may cause problems for you, and which has no right being in a repo anyways. You can now close Terminal.\n\nCongratulations, the plugin is installed! To tidy your PHP code, just hit CtrlAltT. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do i update the openstack api access to be accessible from the outside world My openstack install is working wonderful, with the exception that all api access URLS are 192.168.x.x ...

I want to reinstall the grub from a live CD.But I don't have the live CD of ubuntu 14.04, I only have the live CD of ubuntu 13.10... is it okay to install grub from it?\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly fine to install the GRUB from 13.10 for 14.04. In fact, any distro which is using GRUB2 should be fine for use. However, as long as the Ubuntu installtion is present, you can use the grub utilities from it to install GRUB.

On a menu-based system like KDE or Xfce there would automatically be a new item in the menu for Padre. Is this not the case for Ubuntu Unity (not menu since there is none, but searchable)?\n\nA: For lightdm/unity once you bring the application through terminal an icon should appear in that launch bar on the left.  Right click it and select pin/add to launch bar. There should be something similar in KDE. Yeah some apps just don't show up in search I guess , but it's mostly seems to be common in command line apps. \n", "Q: Plex not detecting media on Amazon S3 mounted with S3QL So I have had a Plex server for a while now, and it has been running on a Dell Poweredge 2850 and Dell Powervault 220s.

I am thinking this is a permissions error with the folder, but I ran chmod 777 for the folder where the S3 bucket was mounted, but Plex still sees nothing in the folder. I tried this with Fuse as well and had the same result, but am going with S3QL because it uploads files in 10mb chunks, so the entire file isn't required to access one part of one file, therefore saving time and bandwidth.\nHere are the guides I used:\nPlex install: https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/26727-how-to-plex-media-server-on-ubuntu/\nS3QL install: http://ubuntuservergui.com/ubuntu-server-guide/mount-s3-ubuntu-server\nI also ran sudo gpasswd -a plex plugdev to give Plex more permissions.\n\nA: Be sure to use the --allow-other option when mounting S3QL.

According to the this tutorial you have to rebuild libgdal against MrSID SDK from LizardTech. But I cannot find the package libgdal-mrsid-src as mentioned in the instructions. However, it appears that this may have been merged into the libgdal-dev package. When I attempt to install this package, I am told that I have to install libmysqlclient-dev but cannot install libmysqlclient-dev since I have MariaDB 10 installed. \nFull error message is:\n\n    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\n    requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\n    distribution that some required packages have not yet been created\n    or been moved out of Incoming.\n    The following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\n    The following packages have unmet dependencies:   \n     libmysqlclient-dev : Depends: libmysqlclient18 (= 5.5.38-0ubuntu0.14.04.1) but\n 10.0.10+maria-1~saucy is to be installed\n    E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages\n\nSo here are my original two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I correct about the libgdal-mrsid-src package being merged with the libgdal-dev package?\n\nAnswer: Yes but you have to use apt-get source libgdal-dev\n\n\n*If the answer to 1 is yes, then how do I correct conflict and still keep MariaDB 10?\n\nAnswer: This seems to be more of a red herring as I am uncertain that libgdal-dev really needs to be installed. However, if you run apt-get install libgdal-dev libmariadbclient-dev the dependencies appear to be met.\n\nNow I am to the point where I getting unsure of my steps.

Which webcam is compatible to Ubuntu 14.04? Have tried Logitech C270, but it is only for windows.\n\nA: The Logitech webcam C270 seems to work pretty well with Ubuntu actually, since quite some time.  \nOne possible problem could be that there are some issues with connecting it to a USB3 port.\nBut that can easlily be worked around by using a USB2 port.\nIf it's not that - what makes you think it does not work well?\nSee also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam\n\nA: I have only had experience with build-in webcams on the laptops that I owned and tried to run Ubuntu on. It worked flawless at least for Skype in all cases. \nSo I would guess, just try it! Even though the manufacturer only offers Windows driver downloads on their site, it doesn't mean that Linux doesn't support it.\n\nA: It's quite difficult to provide a \"full\" list of compatible webcams, there are just too many to test them all.

I may be missing something here but I'm not sure why the code is running before page 2 should be loaded.\nhttp://pastebin.ubuntu.com/8068379/\nAnd is there any way to prevent the functions and code within page 2 from running before the button is pressed?\n\nA: Component.onCompleted runs as soon as the interpreter has read the QML file and parsed it into objects.  Your \"page 2\" object is created at this time, but it has visible: false so you can't see it.  That doesn't keep the onCompleted code from running.\nI know of three ways to get code to run only when the page gets pushed to the stack:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a custom function that calls pageStack.push() and triggers whatever other code you want run.\n\n*Move the code from page 2's onCompleted handler to the onVisibleChanged handler.  Note that this will be called both when the page is pushed a popped from the stack; check the value of visible to tell which is happening.\n\n*Move the page 2 object into a separate file, say \"page2.qml\", and change the push call to pageStack.push(Qt.resolvedUrl(\"page2.qml\")).  This will create a new page 2 object each time it's pushed to the stack; this may or may not be what you desire.\nNote that all three of these will call the code each time page 2 is pushed to the stack.  If you only want it to be called the first time, you'll have to keep track of that yourself.  For more information on how object creation interacts with the pageStack, check out this answer.\n", "Q: Increase default Ubuntu sound volume?

I just had one big 698GB lvm2-pv partition on which Ubuntu was installed.\nTutorials in this website told me about Gpart, LVM Partition Tool, and also partitioning via Live CD/DVD.\nBut I learnt Gpart and LVM P-tool can be used only when the concerned drive is unmounted, and hence I tried Live booting, this time both from USB as well DVD, but to no avail. It straightaway boots to the Ubuntu login screen. I had disabled fastboot and set the boot priorities right in the BIOS too, but still I can't use any of those tools because I can't boot off from the USB or Live DVD.\nWindows setup in USB and DVD too is ignored because there aren't any free partitions on my HDD.\n                    **So where do I want help exactly**\n\nRight now, I have a 750GB HDD of my laptop running Ubuntu 14.04.1 in a single partition which is lvm2-pv in nature. Its size is roughly around 698GB according to its \"properties\".\nWhat I want is, I want to divide it, shrink it in some way, so that I have some free space to install Windows alongside Ubuntu. I do not mind if you suggest something to make my laptop freeDOS again. I can install Windows then, and then proceed(carefully) installing Ubuntu the way I want again.\nPlease help me. I am new to Linux distros, so please be a little detailed in your explanations. There is no data I want to save. I had backed up everything. So any type of suggestions are welcome. Thank You. :)\nP.S. I cannot access BIOS anymore, I do not know why, but I can still access the GRUB menu.\n\nA: LVM has concepts of a physical volume and logical volume.  You can resize logical volumes and even move them between physical drives (each with a physical volume), as much as you like.  But that is only affecting the logical volumes, and you can't install Windows inside one.  To install Windows, you have to put it in a bare partition without LVM that Windows can boot to.\nLVM's not really designed to be able to easily resize or move physical volumes.  It's designed for environments where you just throw a new physical drive in and start migrating.  Manipulating a physical volume on an existing drive can be done, but it's complicated and if done wrong you can lose everything.\nOne alternative way to do this would be to migrate everything off the drive onto a portable or second drive, then reformat the first without LVM, partition it how you like (with a Windows partition) and then migrate back.  You could decide you don't want the hassle of LVM and migrate raw.  Still fairly involved though, as you still need to know how to resize partitions and do a raw block copy of a partition, and if you use LVM on your temporary drive you'll need to boot with a boot CD and mount an LVM volume manually, which is hair-raisingly tricky.  I've done it before with the added complication of luks encryption, which adds another layer of complexity.\nIf you want to resize the LVM physical volume in-place, you can follow some of these instructions.  It'll be faster but you have to be careful.\nHow can I resize an LVM partition? (i.e: physical volume)\nBackup first as it's easy to make a mistake in which you lose your data.\n\nA: I am new to Linux too, just installed ubuntu 14.04 after getting fed up with windows.\nAnyways, I found that lvm can be partitioned, at least this article says that:\nAnd the commands are:\nlvreduce -- Reduce the size of a Logical Volume.\nlvremove -- Remove a Logical Volume.\nlvrename -- Rename a Logical Volume.\nlvresize -- Resize a Logical Volume.\nlvs -- Report information about Logical Volumes.\nlvscan -- Scan (all disks) for Logical Volumes. \n\nfor more info: http://linux.die.net/man/8/lvm\nHope this helps. bye :)\n", "Q: Dual boot fails after updating Ubuntu 14.04 on a dual boot machine with windows 8 on Toshiba Machine Last year i purchased a Toshiba machine with Windows 8 preinstalled.

Is here any command that I can run now to fully scan and remove softwares and packages that have not been properly installed or UNINSTALLED???\n\nA: From what you write, I think you did not actually deinstall or break any installed packages.\nin case you did indeed, sudo debsums -c will help you to find the changes - see What is the apt equivalent to \"rpm -V\" (Verify installed packages).\n\nBut it sounds like you may have installed programs by building it from source, maybe under your home directory?\nIf so, there may be an uninstall command provided, like make uninstall.\nIf you installed something with make install or similar, but there is no make uninstall available, you need to find out which files were installed, and into which directories they were installed.\nIn simple cases this can be seen from the Makefile. But if that does not help, you can just run make install again - only to see the log output of which files are installed to where.\n\nFor future use, take a look at checkinstall - it can track what was installed from source, and cleanly uninstall it.\n\nA: I have two options for you. Either Graphical or command-line\nGraphical Way: Install Synaptic manager and cleanup your System. to install it run \n sudo apt-get install synaptic \n\nor you could try this command from terminal\n sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -f install\n\nto update and attempt to fix your packages. But i recommend you install synaptic and you can find more on this.. askubuntu post \n", "Q: Cannot access PPA ppa:langdalepl/gvfs-mtp on Ubuntu 14.04 I followed the recommendations in the following Q&A to get my phone to work with Ubuntu: \nHow to connect Nokia Lumia 520 to Ubuntu 12.04 \nUnfortunately the installation failed for me.

Observation: if I hit Alt+F2 and enter compiz --replace, then the shorcut key Alt+F4 for closing windows stops working. I am using the latest version of gnome-ubuntu (14.04).\nQuestion: Is there a way to restore the hotkey functionality? Or is there another way to restart compiz without losing the hotkey functionality? Also tell me, if this is a bug, then I'll try to report it! Also sometimes Ctrl+Ctrl/C/V stop working, but it seems to happen for a different reason which I have not found out yet. Therefore it would be nice to know how to restore/relaunch the keyboard functionality in general.\nUnfortunately I have to restart compiz this way sometimes, because occasionally my mouse clicks will stop working (for whatever reason, but this is a different story), and the solution other people with the same problem have found is to restart compiz.\n\nA: I believe this is a bug.  Going into CCSM and toggling the Close Window key binding under General Options fixed it for me, but this is obviously not an ideal solution.\n\nA: This behaviour also can happen with unity --replace.\nOne possible solution is to check in whether commands are enable in CompizConfig Settings Manager (you may need to install it with apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager).\nLook for an option called 'Commands', in the 'General' category. In my case this was un-checked. I suspect these settings may have been used when restarting Unity/Compiz, though that doesn't explain how Alt-F4 worked at first, after logging in. \nI'm using the Unity edition of Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: To restart both Compiz and Unity open the terminal and type:  \nsetsid compiz --replace    \nsetsid unity  \n\nAfter running these two commands the keyboard shortcuts will work normally (because of restarting Unity). \n", "Q: Keyboard layout changes to English after each reboot Recently I upgraded my Ubuntu to 14.04 and now my keyboard layout changes to \"English (US)\" each time I reboot, even though in the top right of my screen \"German (Swiss)\" is selected as the active keyboard.

Flickable{\nButton{\nonClicked: parent.?????????\n}\n\nOr do I have to create a function for this?\n\nA: You can make a Flickable scroll to a specific point by setting the contentY property of a Flickable. Quoting the official documentation from qt-project.org,\n\nContentY holds the surface coordinate currently at the top-left corner\n  of the Flickable. For example, if you flick an image up 100 pixels,\n  contentY will be 100.\n\nSo if you want to scroll a Flickable smoothly with the press of a button, you could animate the contentY property change like,\nBehavior on contentY {\n    UbuntuNumberAnimation {}\n}\n\nThis will gradually change the value of contentY instead of setting it to its final value abruptly.\nYou can find more about the contentY property here.\n", "Q: Cannot enter ubuntu graphical environment after update I was using ubuntu 12.04 LTS version and everything was working fine.

When starting GIMP it works perfectly at first, but as soon as I copy a selection of pixels value in \"system monitoring > resources > memory and swap history > memory\" (hope those terms are correct, had to translate them) starts to increase and it doesn't stop until the memory reaches values bigger than 95%, which dramatically decreases the performance of my operating system. After closing GIMP the memory value suddenly decreases to some value below 30%. Something else I realized: as soon as the memory starts to increase, the cursor in GIMP changes to a busy cursor (or hourglass cursor or whatever it is called) for a very short period of time and this cursor change happens approximately once each second. I assume that GIMP is saving something each second, even though I don't actively save anything. I also assume that it has something to do with the clipboard since if I execute \"xsel -bc\" in a terminal, the memory increase stops (but does not reduce to its initial value).\nHelp would very much be appreciated!\n\nA: We've seen a problem with similar symptoms reported as https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699625\nThere, the clipboard link grabbing of jdownloader continued to increase the memory usage of GIMP. If you use this tool, or something else that accesses the clipboard (KDE's klipper used to cause the same, IIRC), then you might be able to work around the problem by disabling those.\nWhether the problem is in GIMP or GTK+ - the UI framework - has not been determined yet.\n", "Q: How do I install ntfs-3g (ntfsprogs) manually on Ubuntu?

You should be able to paste the paths in a text editor of your choice without any problem. \nIf you want to process the files in a terminal window you will have to select Paste Filenames in the right-click context menu. \nAnother way to pass file paths as arguments from Nautilus is to simply drag and drop the selected items into the terminal.

Even after removing hostapd, still Network Manager icon is not appearing.    \n\n\n*\n\n*During boot up:\n\nWaiting up to 60 seconds to start network configuration\n\n\n*and after that another message:\n\nbooting up without network configuration  \n\nHow can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: A bug with Network Manager obviously can be solved this way:\nFirst you need anyway purge hostapd together with configuration:\nsudo apt-get purge hostapd\n\nThen try to reinstall network-manager, and this way your configuration of network-manager will be saved:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall -fmu network-manager\n\nwhere -f is fix-broken, -m is fix-missing and -u is show upgraded\nsudo reboot\n\nOR completely purge hostapd & network-manager together with their configurations and again freshly install network-manager by single command:\nsudo apt-get purge -y hostapd && sudo apt-get purge -y network-manager && sudo apt-get install network-manager && sudo reboot\n\nFor a chance to have hostapd installed my opinion you need to go step-by-step this guide:\nWifiDocs / MasterMode\nThen, if success you can begin stepping second guide to setup your wifi from there:\nUsing hostapd on Ubuntu to create a wifi access point\nCited the part 5.Troubleshooting from second guide:\n\nIf you have network-manager configured to use your wifi card, you\n  should disable auto-connect for all the wireless connections.\n  Otherwise, it may interfere with hostapd. If some frequencies are\n  disabled, make sure your driver is set to use the right regulatory\n  domain. You can see the current one with:\niw reg get\n\nIf it says country 00, you need to set it manually, in\n  /etc/default/crda. To set it manually you need (at least for some\n  cards) to have cfg80211 and mac80211 installed as kernel modules. You\n  can check if they’re installed as modules by using:\nzcat /proc/config.gz\n\nLook for CONFIG_CFG80211=m, if it says “=y” then it’s compiled into\n  the kernel, and you’ll need to re-install your kernel. If you’re using\n  an Atheros card, you may also need to set the region in the driver.

When I connect a USB disk it is not automatically mounted and it doesn't show up in the file manager PCManFM. What daemon do I need to run to enable automatic mounting of USB disks?\n\nA: The following two steps are required:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the window manager with dbus-launch in ~/.xinitrc:\nexec dbus-launch --exit-with-session <your-wm>\n\nThis makes the disks show up in PCManFM.\n\n*Add a file named (e.g.) udisks.pkla to /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/ with the content:\n[Allow mounting removable media]\nIdentity=unix-group:plugdev\nAction=org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount\nResultActive=yes\nResultInactive=yes\nResultAny=yes\n\nThough this also allows unmounting of removable media I still get a (false) error message from PCManFM saying \"Not authorized to perform operation\".\n\nA: In addition to August's answer, the following. When rightclicking on the mounted removable media in pcmanfm serveral actions to choose from show up. Two of those are Umount Volume and Eject Removable media. When Unmount Volume is chosen the volume will be unmounted without warning. If on the other hand Eject Removable media is chosen, the volume will be unmounted but not ejected and a \"Not authorized to perform operation\" message will appear. For permission to eject the media, another rule has to be added to /etc/polkit-1/localautority/50-local.d. In this directory create a file called udisks.drive-eject.pkla and add the following code to it:\n[Allow ejecting removable media]\n Identity=unix-group:plugdev\n Action=org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject-media\n ResultActive=yes\n ResultInactive=yes\n ResultAny=yes\nNow the removable media is ejectable. There will be no more warnings. Leftclicking on the mounted removable media in pcmanfm tells pcmanfm to eject the media, hence the warning before adding the second rule.\n", "Q: How to enable 24bit true color support in Gnome terminal? According to this page, Gnome Terminal supports 24bit true color. This is consistent with Wikipedia.\nWhen I run color-spaces.pl in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Gnome Terminal 3.6.2, the result is the following:\n\nWhile there is no reference image, I imagine that those green strangely-shaped objects at the bottom indicate that the terminal is unable to print 24bit colors correctly.\nHow to enable 24bit support?\n\nA: 24bit support is enabled by default but gnome-terminal has to be in version linked against libvte >= 0.36 (as stated on the page you mentioned). Which unfortunetly is not the case in the latest ubuntu 14.04 (at the time of writing).\nAs a workaround you may try:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging\n\nLast step removes their ppa - it's optional but be carefull, there is whole gnome3 at that ppa.\nOh and the screen: \n", "Q: File/directory compare with right click in Thunar / Xubuntu I would like to be able to compare files or directories by multiple-selecting them and then right clicking (for example, if there was a \"compare\" option in the context menu).\nOn Ubuntu with Nautilus, I would install the package nautilus-compare. How can I get this ability in Xubuntu? (in Thunar in Xubuntu - I don't mean by installing Nautilus)\nThe comparison program I use is meld, but a general answer would be most useful.\n\nA: The accepted answer is very close, but not entirely correct.\nIn order to compare multiple files / directories, create a new Action with the following command:\n\nmeld %F\n\nOnly using \"meld %f\" will only allow you to open one object in meld.\nSee attached screenshots for an example.\nBasic Action Seetings\nAction Appearance Conditions\nI would have made this a comment, but I am not yet allowed to do so.\n\nA: Apparently, Thunar makes it easy to do this. It has something called \"custom actions\". An answer to this question about customizing context menus in Thunar contains a tutorial of how to do this.\nI added a new custom action called \"Compare\" by going to edit->configure custom actions. For using meld, like I wanted, I used the command meld %f, and in the \"Appearance Conditions\" tab, I chose text files and directories.\n\nA: I'm an xubuntu user but not a Thunar user.  As you may have noticed it isn't brimming with features.  Sometimes light can be TOO light.\nMy solution to disliking Thunar is to use Dolphin, which is a KDE app and my favorite file manager, hands down.  Installing it pulls in a shedload of KDE dependencies but that doesn't bug me.\nYou could just try installing nautilus.

There are a number of reasons for that, the first is security. Since this organization is 100% volunteer run, I don't want anyone messing with the OS once I have everything configured.  The second reason is to reduce overhead, but that isn't as important to me as the security aspect.\nI know in Windows, I could simply create a batch script that starts QLC+, and modify the registry entry at: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Current Version\\Winlogon\\Shell to point to the batch file instead of explorer.exe, but I'm pretty sure that Ubuntu will work better for this project than Windows will; even though QLC+ is cross platform.\nHere's what I have so far in my attempts to do this on my own:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can put a new startup entry in Ubuntu's Startup Applications Preferences with the command: qlcplus --open %f, and it opens QLC+ along with the desktop manager.\n\n*I have tried replacing the ubuntu.desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions with a file containing the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=qlcplus --open %f\nTerminal=false\nName=WSCC Lighting Console\n\nWhen I start the computer with that configuration, it logs in with the GUI, but just sits and doesn't load QLC+.\n\n\n*Since when I open a terminal session in that state and run startx, it opens just QLC+ at this point, I tried modifying the ubuntu.desktop file to contain the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=startx\nTerminal=false\nName=WSCC Lighting Console\n\nIt seems like I am almost there, but I am missing something.\n\nA: OK, although I didn't accomplish my goal exactly the way that I was looking for, but after doing some research I did find a way of doing this for the specific application that I am looking for.  It appears that QLC+ happens to have a kiosk mode built into the Linux version, so the syntax that I need to run in my auto start entry is:\nqlcplus --kiosk --fullscreen --open workspace.qxw\n\nI would still be interested in knowing how I could have gone about doing it the way I had been asking, since I may run into something similar in the future, so if anyone has a way of doing it as phrased in the question, I would still love to hear it for learning's sake.\n", "Q: Building xvidcap on Ubuntu 14.04 - undefined reference to symbol 'XGetWindowAttributes' I'm trying to build xvidcap from sources on Ubuntu 14.04 since no package is available.\nI've stumbled upon following error during make:\n\ngcc -Wall -g -DDBUS_SERVICE_DIR=\\\"\"/usr/local/share/dbus-1/service\"\\\" -g -O2 -pthread -I /home/jesper/xvidcap-1.1.7 -I/home/jesper/xvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libavcodec -I/home/jesper/\nxvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libavformat -I/home/jesper/xvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libavutil -I/home\n/jesper/xvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libswscale -I/home/jesper/xvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libavdevice \n-export-dynamic -L/home/jesper/xvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libavcodec -L/home/jesper/xvidcap-\n1.1.7/ffmpeg/libavformat -L/home/jesper/xvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libavutil -L/home/jesper\n/xvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libswscale -L/home/jesper/xvidcap-1.1.7/ffmpeg/libavdevice -o \nxvidcap app_data.o capture.o codecs.o colors.o frame.o gnome_frame.o gnome_ui.o \ngnome_warning.o gnome_options.o led_meter.o main.o options.o xtoffmpeg.o xtoxwd.o job.o \nxvc_error_item.o eggtrayicon.o  -pthread -lglade-2.0 -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lxml2 -lgdk-x11-2.0 \n-latk-1.0 -lgio-2.0 -lpangoft2-1.0 -lpangocairo-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lcairo -lpango-1.0 \n-lfontconfig -lgobject-2.0 -lfreetype -lgthread-2.0 -lglib-2.0    -Wl,-Bstatic -lavcodec \n-Wl,-Bdynamic -Wl,-Bstatic -lswscale -Wl,-Bdynamic -Wl,-Bstatic -lavutil -Wl,-Bdynamic  \n-lm -lXdamage -lXfixes -lXmu \n/usr/bin/ld: frame.o: undefined reference to symbol 'XGetWindowAttributes'\n//usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libX11.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Try this: LIBS=\"-lX11 -ldl -lXext -lz\" ./configure\n", "Q: Fonts displayed at larger size in documents compared to Windows I use Libreoffice both at home and at work.

Not just not at boot-time, but at all. There's no error message. tty7 stays blank. It doesn't seem to attempt to start an X server. It doesn't log anything in /var/log/gdm or /var/log/Xorg.0.log (anywhere else I should look?). \n$ sudo start gdm\ngdm start/running, process 17747\n$ sudo start gdm\ngdm start/running, process 17769\n$ sudo start gdm\ngdm start/running, process 17791\n$ sudo stop gdm\nstop: Unknown instance: \n\nI've purged gdm, installed gdm, reinstalled gdm with -f and -m for good measure, wiped /usr/share/gdm, /etc/gdm, /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d and even ~/.config/dconf/user... nothing! Upgrading to 14.10 didn't help, either. \nRunning the gdm binary itself starts up some sort of miniature Gnome-Shell with nothing to do. \nGnome-Shell itself works fine with lightdm... minus the screen lock functionality, which I want.

Both have KDE in addition to Gnome-Shell. (Well, I reinstalled the Eee PC with elementary OS yesterday). \nUpdate: sudo start gdm says \"gdm start/running\" and provides a pid even with the gdm binary itself removed. \n\nA: I suspect a bug. Maybe gdm's crashing on launch.\nIn theory sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install gdm might help if it's corrupted or (more likely as it was likely upgraded when you upgraded your release to Utopic) its config is bad. So I'd try that first.\nWhen that fails, I suggest enabling automated bug reporting to Launchpad, then see if you're offered the chance to submit a bug report when you launch gdm with sudo start gdm. (On 14.10, you likely do not need to do this, as development releases are set up to let you report bugs in this way.)\n\n\n*\n\n*That works for the typical case of checking to see if a program that doesn't appear to run properly is crashing. But since a GUI is likely not running when you attempt to start gdm (if one is, maybe that's the problem!), you may have to manually check to see if Apport generated any data on the crash.\nAssuming you're running sudo start gdm from a text-based virtual console, which is the usual case, you will likely not actually be informed explicitly of the crash. But assuming you set up Apport as detailed above, you can then check to see if there is a .crash file in /var/crash for gdm.\nYou can then continue the bug reporting process by running ubuntu-bug ... (from in a GUI) or apport-cli ... (non-graphical), with ... replaced by the name of the .crash file, including the .crash suffix. Either do this from the /var/crash directory or start the filename with /var/crash/.\nIf Apport generated .crash file and/or prompted you to report a bug, that confirms it's a crash (and thus almost certainly a bug). You can go through with the report, but please read this first.\n", "Q: How does the ubuntu Live CD check itself for defects?

I am new to Ubuntu and I have a looot of issues :))! I saw that many things can be solved by typing commands in that window, terminal, which is kinda new to me( I am Windows 7 user, not a developer). \nMoving to the point, whenever I try to type commands in the Terminal, it is prompting me to type the password. Firstly: which password, since I deactivated typing the password at logon. Maybe it's the same :-?... Secondly, I can't get to type it all, because it tells me: \"Sorry, try again.\" And the 3 password attempts thing. \nSo, I googled it a little and I found that it's a TextExpander problem. What is that, and how can it be solved? I going crazy, since I can't enter a single command without that annoying password prompt.\nThanks a lot guys, and wait for me, I'm gonna ask a lot of questions, since I found this site is made especially for this! ;))\n\nA: The explain\nPassword prompting in Linux is a security thing. Linux is built with far higher security than Windows. It usually prompts you with a password if you're making installations or changing system-wide settings. You will notice password prompting usually if a command is preceeded by sudo. That means \"super user do\", or do this in super-user privileges, aka in Windows, run as Administrator. The only difference, is that you usually don't need to provide your password in Windows.\nThe ease\nIf you run commands with sudo in the terminal, the password you provide typically expires 15 minutes after the last sudo execution. That means that if you will need to make many changes in the system you can keep executing as many sudo commands that you like and you will have to type the password just once, that is, until it expires.\nFor those that will make changes to the system for an extended period of time and would like to lock the terminal in super-user mode, these commands may be executed in the Terminal:\n$ sudo su\n\nor\n$ sudo -i\n\nThen notice how your terminal prompt will change. It will stay there until you type the command exit. Just as note, once you are in super-user prompt (eg root@comp:/home/user#) remove all the preceeding sudos from the commands you copied from the internet. (And as a side note, pasting in the Terminal is Ctrl+Shift+V)\nPS\n And yes, the password you type is your user password. Hopefully you didn't forget it. :)\n\nA: It's the same password you desabled on login (the one you set on installation), you can bypass the password requirement by editing the /etc/sudoers file.\nThis file is extremely delicate, if you get it wrong the system won't be able to grand you administration privileges anymore. There exist however a program called visudo which can help you to edit it safety and make sure the syntax is fine.\nsudo visudo\n\nThis command will open a cli editor. Go to the end of the file and type:\n\n%your_user_name_here ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nSave, exit, and reload the session. This new setting will allow you to run those commands with sudo but without the need of typing the password everytime (see The eye answer), there may be security risks but it'll ease your administration tasks while you learn more about Linux.\n", "Q: The XServer config file is not found I have recently purchased a new discrete GPU and have to configure the XServer.

Has been successful so far.\n\n\nHow do I set up sudo with its own Password, and then run sudo apt-get clean?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you would like to set up a universal password that all users would have to input in order to execute a command as root with a sudo command.\nExample:\n\n\n*\n\n*Account-A = Password-1\n\n*Account-B = Password-2\n\n*root          = root-password\n\n\nIf Account-A or Account-B enters the command:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nThen the subsequent output:\n[sudo] password for root:\n\nwould be the same for both users.\nThis is typically NOT the preferred method of security through the use of sudo as implemented by Ubuntu.\nThis is not the recommended method of password implementation\nFor security reasons, Ubuntu does not enable a root user account.

Type the number that corresponds to \"/bin/nano\" and press enter. \nThen, execute the following command to edit your sudoers file. You must use the visudo command to edit the /etc/sudoers file. Do NOT edit this file using gedit, do NOT use vi, DON'T use nano or leafpad or any other text editor because you risk locking yourself out of the sudo command completely for all users if there is a synatax error.

I had to reinstall Windows 7 and created a partition for it, with the remaining volume (unallocated) being dedicated to the Ubuntu partition.\nThe Ubuntu installer, however, doesn't recognize that partition as free space - in fact, all it does is recognize the entire volume of 240gb from the raid 0, not being able to see the partitions. How do I proceed in this situation? I have an HDD here, but I wanted to install Ubuntu on my SSDs because of the performance.\n\nA: Ok I think I can answer your question.

Here's what I have done:\n - created bootable flash drive with Ubuntu installer\n - created a partition (ext4) using half of my total hard drive space (around 225 GB)\nThe problem I encounter is that Ubuntu is not detecting any OS, which in this case would be my Windows 8. I think I may be able to just manually choose my newly created partition, but I am still hesitant to proceed because of this. I'm not sure exactly what I should do. I want to install it permanently anyway, but I was under the impression that there would be an option for \"Try Ubuntu\" and I only see \"Install Ubuntu\", and I don't want it to somehow mess up my current OS, as I want to be able to boot into either one. I noticed that people had said in other places to disable quickboot in the BIOS, and I haven't figured out how to do this. I disabled Fast Startup, but I am pretty sure that isn't the same thing.\n\nI went ahead and installed, and it seems to be working fine. I was wondering though, I only created the root abd swap partitions, and I noticed that it was suggested there be 3, root, home and swap, with home being the disk for most if the memory. should i format the partition, create the home partition and then reinstall?\n\nA: Look at this article to see how to Try Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your Windows Installation and make sure you create a Windows USB stick (unless you have a Windows installation\ndisk) alongwith your Ubuntu USB drive before going further.\n\n*Secondly, yes you can install Ubuntu manually.

If you get to a grub prompt, try looking at the hd1 disk and see if it is the one you expect (check avail partitions with the tab completion is one easy way).  type set root=(hd1,  TAB   and the partitions will be listed.  If you are getting the other disk, edit the hd1 s to hd0 s, try the boot with F10 or crtl X.  If that's the issue, you can edit all the hds in the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file, but be ready to do that each time you update kernels.  I have not seen hard disks get mixed up like that, but USB disks are subject to that, and the BIOS enumeration is not even consistent, but changes sometimes -- maybe a timing issue.\n", "Q: problem in creating free space for root, swap and home I'm trying to install ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 7. I'm done with the partition part where, I've created a free space of 50GB for root, swap and home directories. I'm using liveusb to install ubuntu. Everything went fine until they asked about the installation type, as I chose something else for installation type. But, the main problem is that I can't see the free space which I've allocated beforehand. I can see the following devices:\n/dev/sda\n/dev/sda1\n/dev/sda2\n/dev/sda3ntfs\n/dev/dsa4ntfs\n What might be the problem?\nHelp me ASAP.\n\nA: Boot into LiveCD and run Gparted. It gives you visual representation of partitions which is easier to understand for newbie. I guess installator had already prepared your free space for installation. You will just need to delete these extra partitions from Gparted.\n\nA: You have to judge by partition size. Map it with you Disk Manager in your Windows system, or try with the Disks or GParted utilities provided on your Ubuntu live CD (as Barafu said).\nOr simply try Wubi.\nHow does it describe sda1 and sda2?\nWhile Windows names partitions with drive letters (such as C:, D:, E:), Unix-like operating systems, such as Ubuntu, use a different syntax.\nQuoting from Shadur's answer to What does /dev/sda for linux mean? (on Super User):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*/dev/ is the part in the unix directory tree that contains all \"device\" files -- unix traditionally treats just about everything you\n  can access as a file to read from or write to.\n  \n*sd originally identified a SCSI device, but since the wildgrowth of USB (and other removable) data carriers it became a catch-all for\n  any block device (another unix term; in this context, anything capable\n  of carrying data) that wasn't already accessible via IDE. When SATA\n  came around, the developers figured it'd be much easier and much more\n  convenient for everyone to add it into the existing framework rather\n  than write a whole new framework.\n  \n*The letter immediately after sd signifies the order in which it was first found -- a,b,c...z, Aa...Az... etc. (Not that there are many\n  situations in the real world where more than 26 discrete block devices\n  are on the same bus...)\n  \n*Finally, the number after that signifies the partition on the device. Note that because of the rather haphazard way PCs handle\n  partitioning there are only four \"primary\" partitions, so the\n  numbering will be slightly off from the actual count. This isn't a\n  terrible problem as the main purpose for the naming scheme is to have\n  a unique and recognizable identifier for each partition found in this\n  manner...\n  \n  \n  So /dev/sda9 means the ninth partition on the first drive.\n\n", "Q: How do I recall the \"You have just entered a DVD\" prompt after banishing it?

The problem I have is that when I run a Windows 7 Vm, it says that 3D support was disabled. (I can't read the exact report atm because it has a chance of crashing my machine.) I have the 3D support box enabled. Here is my graphics card: Mobile Intel® GM45 Express Chipset x86/MMX/SSE2. Can anyone tell me to install drivers or something? I can't find mine anywhere!\n\nA: There are two things that you should check, the first as mentioned by @kkpatel is that the VM Tools will need to be installed in your virtual Windows machine.  This can be done in a couple of manners, but the easiest is this:  While the VM is running, and not in full-screen mode, choose 'VM' from the VMWare Menu, and in the menu the second to bottom option will be either 'Install VMWare Tools' or 'Reinstall VMWare Tools'  This forces the mount of the VMWare tools as a CDRom on your Windows installation, and allows the addition of the various drivers needed my VMWare.\nSecondly, there might be a setting preventing VMWare from accessing your graphics drivers.\nYou can edit the preferences for vmware from a terminal by entering the command\ngedit ~/.vmware/preferences\nLook for a line like mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = TRUE - yours may say FALSE instead of TRUE.

Here is the answer to allowing users to use passwd function to change their password when they are using SSSD with ldap backend. If they can indeed authenticate with their password via ssh to the SSSD client, then the problem of changing their password which produces the following: \"passwd: Authentication token manipulation error\"  comes from the LDAP ACL. Need self write access to userPassword Attribute\nAdd the following to your ldap config file when using olc. Edit olcDatabase={2}bdb.ldif olcAccess: \n{0}to attrs=userPassword,shadowLastChange by self write by anonymous \n            auth by dn=\"cn=Manager,dc=domain.com\" write by * none\n\nMake sure you add some more to allow reads and writes for any other attributes you want. \nolcAccess: {2}to * by * read by users read by anonymous auth\n\nYou just have to do it once for all users. {0}to attrs=userPassword... just as I listed above is applied as an ACL to the ldap server and applied globally. If you edit the olcDatabase={2}bdb.ldif olcAccess manually you have to change the CRC, but thats easy as there are many readmes on that.\nThe other user posted changing bind credentials on the clients /etc/sssd/sssd.conf like this:\nldap_default_bind_dn = cn=Manager,dc=mydomain,dc=fqdn.com ldap_default_authtok_type = password ldap_default_auttok = secret\n\nModifying in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf bind credentials didn't work for me, but allowing users to selfwrite their userPassword attribute did... You may not always want this, but for using the passwd function on linux clients with SSSD and LDAP backend you need it.\n\nA: fixed. \nIt was to do with the bind to ldap in sssd.conf. As a temp work around I have used the administrator user/pass in there and I can change password using passwd. I know nothing about AD, so I'll play around with it more, but at least i know the issue lies in the permissions of the bind user.\n\nA: Add the following to your /etc/sssd/sssd.conf:\n[domain/LDAP]\n...\n# changing passwords not working otherwise\n# see https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/2204\nkrb5_use_enterprise_principal = false\n\n", "Q: What is the bash command: `command`? The command command has no manual entry but help displays as follows:\n$ help command\ncommand: command [-pVv] command [arg ...]\n    Execute a simple command or display information about commands.\n    \n    Runs COMMAND with ARGS suppressing  shell function lookup, or display\n    information about the specified COMMANDs.

Digging into man bash we can see what its use is:  \n(from man bash):  \ncommand [-pVv] command [arg ...]\n              Run  command  with  args  suppressing  the normal shell function\n              lookup. Only builtin commands or commands found in the PATH  are\n              executed.   If the -p option is given, the search for command is\n              performed using a default value for PATH that is  guaranteed  to\n              find  all  of  the  standard  utilities.  If either the -V or -v\n              option is supplied, a description of command is printed.  The -v\n              option  causes a single word indicating the command or file name\n              used to invoke command to be displayed; the -V option produces a\n              more  verbose  description.  If the -V or -v option is supplied,\n              the exit status is 0 if command was found, and  1  if  not.   If\n              neither  option  is  supplied  and  an error occurred or command\n              cannot be found, the exit status is 127.   Otherwise,  the  exit\n              status of the command builtin is the exit status of command.  \n\nEssentially you would use command to bypass \"normal function lookup\". For example, say you had a function in your .bashrc:  \nfunction say_hello() {\n   echo 'Hello!'\n}\n\nNormally, when you run say_hello in your terminal bash would find the function named say_hello in your .bashrc before it found, say, an application named say_hello. Using:  \ncommand say_hello  \n\nmakes bash bypass its normal function lookup and go straight to either builtins or your $PATH. Note that this function lookup also include aliases. Using command will bypass both functions and aliases.\nIf the -p option is provided bash bypasses your custom $PATH and uses its own default.  \nThe -v or -V flags bash prints a description (short for -v, long for -V) of the command. \nNote: As souravc pointed out in the comments an easier method for finding information about shell builtins can be found here: How to make `man` work for shell builtin commands and keywords? \n\nA: command is useful, for example, if you want to check for the existence of a particular command. which includes aliases into the lookup so it is not suitable for this purpose because you don't want a random alias to be considered as the command in question.\nIn other words, you can have a small function in a shell script like this:\nexists() {\n  command -v \"$1\" >/dev/null 2>&1\n}\n\nAnd then test for an available command (here, dialog), like so:\nif ! exists dialog ; then\n   echo \"This script requires 'dialog'.\"\n   echo \"Install it with 'sudo apt-get install dialog', then try again!\"\n   exit 1\nfi\n\n\nA: It lets you run a shell command ignoring any shell functions.\nhttp://ss64.com/bash/command.html\n\nA: This is built-in command of the Bash shell.\nThe only advantage I see with this built-in is summarized in the following sentence of the help text:\n\nCan be used to invoke commands on disk when a function with the same name exists.\n\nSo if you want to execute a program (a binary file saved somewhere on your disk), and an internal shell function of the same name exists, then you can invoke your program using this built-in.\nAnd yes, command -v will give the same kind of result as type.\nI've found it also under the Dash shell.\n\nA: It has two different uses:\nOne use is to ignore aliases and functions, and run the executable file found in PATH, even when an alias or a function with the same name exists.\nAs example, I'll use an alias for ls that appends a / to directory names:\n$ alias ls='ls --classify'\n$ ls -d .\n./\n$ command ls -d .\n.\n\nIn an interactive shell, it may be more convenient to use a backslash before the command name as alternative, shorter syntax:\n$ \\ls -d .\n.\n\nThe other use is to find the command that will be run when the commands name isn't used by using the option -v. It seems to be the most portable/POSIX variant of which.\n$ command -v ls\nalias ls='ls --classify'\n$ command -v sed\n/bin/sed\n\n\nA: I've seen in used as a technique to pass command line arguments to executables that need to be ran as a background process.

The email takes you to this page on their website:\n\nDropbox was initially installed using the Ubuntu Software Centre.\nFor the inexperienced user, is it best/easier to remove the package from within the USC and then re-install or is there a more elegant way of obtaining the update, for example using sudo apt-get update dropbox ?\n\nA: I would uninstall your current version through the Ubuntu Software Center. Then go to the link and download the .deb for your architecture (32 or 64 bit), and install that. That will add the repository to your system and updates will be install with regular system updates, when they are available.\n\nA: Some general advice first:\n\nFor the inexperienced user, is it best/easier to remove the package from within the USC and then re-install or is there a more elegant way of obtaining the update, for example using sudo apt-get update dropbox ?\n\nFor the inexperienced user, it is absolutely best and easier, by a long stretch, to not install any packages manually. Installing a .deb package manually means that you will not receive any more automatic updates to that package, since it was not installed via any repositories known to your system. This means you will have to keep updating that package yourself, e.g., regularly going to that Downloads page and downloading the newest version. Additionally, the packages available there have not undergone any quality checks by Ubuntu, and so compatibility with your system is not necessarily guaranteed. Worst case, you may end up with some weird unresolvable dependencies.\nSo yes, there is a more elegant way of obtaining the update: sit back and wait.\nThe newest version of the Dropbox client will certainly be added to the Ubuntu repositories soon enough. If the Dropbox client available in the repositories did not work any longer with the current Dropbox servers, this would be a problem that would not affect only you, but thousands of other Ubuntu users as well. And so, it would be resolved quickly.\nTo sum up, don't try to fix a working system.\nConcerning installation of the Dropbox client:\nAfter having done a bit of research, it seems that there are at least three possibilities how to install (i.e., how you could have previously installed) the Dropbox client. Let's go through them:\n1. Installing the package nautilus-dropbox from multiverse\nThe name of the package may be slightly confusing. It is the one package in the official repositories that contains the actual, proprietary Dropbox client itself. That is, when you install this package, it will automatically download the proprietary Dropbox client from the Dropbox website and install it (to /usr/bin/dropbox). Yes, it does also contain an extension to integrate the Dropbox client with Nautilus, Ubuntu's standard file manager (/usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-3.0/libnautilus-dropbox.so), whence the package's name.\nSince the package contains non-free, proprietary software, it is contained in the multiverse repository.\nFor all the reasons I mentioned under \"Some general advice\", this is the one method I absolutely recommend to install the Dropbox client, particularly so for Ubuntu novices. It will be managed by the package manager, it's in the official repos, you'll be fine. The Ubuntu Team will take care of that package working for you.\nTo install this package, all you need to do is:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-dropbox\n\nTo remove it again:\nsudo apt-get remove nautilus-dropbox\n\n2. Installing the package dropbox from Dropbox's 3rd party repository\nDropbox manages its own repository that you can add to your list of package repositories, and install the Dropbox client from. See How do I add or remove Dropbox from my Linux repository? on the Dropbox's website help pages.\nOnce you've added that repository as explained in the instructions under that link, you will be able to install the proprietary Dropbox client directly from the Dropbox servers using the package management system.\nBasically, to install Dropbox like that, first enable the repository with\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 5044912E\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://linux.dropbox.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main\"\n\n(This is slightly more elegant than what they tell you on the help pages, but really boils down to the same), and then install the package with\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install dropbox\n\nThis is the second best method. The package is still managed by the package management system, but the repository is not managed by Canonical. So while you'll receive updates via the package management system for that package, you'll just have to trust that the package provided by Dropbox will work fine with your Ubuntu system.\nA slight advantage may be that this package may be more up-to-date than the nautilus-dropbox package in the multiverse repository. So if you like to be on the bleeding edge this option may be more interesting for you. However, as I said the first option will certainly work, i.e., if the Dropbox client provided in the multiverse repo does not even function anymore, this problem will certainly be taken care of.\nTo revert an installation performed like this, remove the package first:\nsudo apt-get remove dropbox\n\nand then remove the repository with its key:\nsudo add-apt-repository -r http://linux.dropbox.com/ubuntu\nsudo apt-key del 5044912E\n\n3. Installing the Dropbox client manually\nThis is the worst method, and the one you referred to in your question, also explained in the Dropbox installation instructions on Dropbox's website. Basically, to install it manually do\ncd ~\nwget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.$(uname -m)\" | tar xzf -\n\n(Again, slightly more elegant than what they tell you - this will work for both 32bit and 64bit). What this does is create a copy of the Dropbox client in your home folder. This installation is local (it can only be used by the user who executed that command), not system-wide. Additionally, updates will not be managed the package management system.\nAccording to a comment by DKBose to this answer, when installing the client like this it will still be automatically updated. If that holds true, it only means that the client itself checks for, downloads and installs its own updates. Since it is installed locally inside a user's home folder, it doesn't need root privileges to do so. However, the client is not managed by the package management system. It is very un-Linux like to rely on such proprietary, intransparent update procedures - this is usually the job of the package manager, which does this centrally and transparently, so that you can use it to list, update or remove any of your installed packages.\nTo remove the software, if installed like this, is accordingly ugly:\nrm -r ~/.dropbox-dist/\n\nThis is for the version I just tested, and works as of now because what the downloaded archive contains is precisely this .dropbox-dist/ folder. It may change in the future. When you don't use the package manager you cannot really track what files were installed where.\nI would use this method if and only if I have no root privileges on a machine, and therefore am forced to a local install. If you do have root privileges, even if you insist on using the version that comes directly from the Dropbox servers, the second method is still to be preferred. At least the package management system will track the installed files, updates happen in a more transparent fashion and removal of the software is smooth.\nSumming up, my advice is this. If you installed the Dropbox client using methods 2 or 3, uninstall it, and install it using method 1. Whatever you do, with the first two methods the Dropbox client will be automatically updated by the package management system. When using the third method, the client apparently also takes care of updating itself. So basically, there's no need to worry - you will automatically get the newest version anyway.\n\nA: I would download and install the deb, after uninstalling the old one. As the email says, there are important security improvements. Security updates are of the utmost importance and should be installed. If you wait for the repos to be updated, then you may be waiting a while.\n\nA: I found that when I installed from the drobpox package repository (which at this moment provides the same deb as the one from the download link), I was unable to use dropbox - after entering my account details, the dropbox window reported in red that I needed to install an updated version from the web page indicated in the question.\nWhen I downloaded and unpacked the tar.gz file and installed as per instructed, dropbox is working once again.\nNote that with this version, you have to run it manually (or set up something to run it automatically). Also, to connect to your dropbox account, dropboxd writes a url to the terminal where you ran it. If you paste that url into a browser and enter you account login details, dropbox starts syncing your files.\nI had to do one more thing: I have my local dropbox folder symlinked to another hard drive. dropboxd didn't recognise the symlink, created an empty directory in it's place and started downloading all my files (there are many!). I killed dropboxd, recreated the symlink and restarted dropboxd again and all's fine (well, it had to re-index everything, which took a while).\n", "Q: Upgraded 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS Now Wireless Networking is Disabled I have just upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04. The upgrade process went off smoothly, only asked if I wanted to keep some old configs (which I did) and I restarted the computer when finished.\nThe computer is a HP Envy M6 (less than a year old) originally with Windows 8 which I completely nuked in favor of Ubuntu about five months ago.

What is the purpose of this user?\nman:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh\n\n\nA: man (the command, not the user) is a help application. Applications provide man pages in their packages but man needs to know where they are and also what help they provide. To speed things up — so man isn't search the whole filesystem when you type man <command> — these man pages are indexed into a database by a command called mandb.\nIn Ubuntu mandb stores indexes in a GNU gdbm database at /var/cache/man/index.db (and a few language specific versions in the same directory). This is a key-value hashing database not dissimilar to memcache, or a hundred other implementations on similar ideas. It's binary, light and fast. I'll throw in an example of how to play with it at the end.\nThis indexing is scheduled to run daily in Ubuntu by /etc/cron.daily/man-db. The whole script runs as root and does some cleaning up first but right at the end we see mandb being run as the man user:\n# --pidfile /dev/null so it always starts; mandb isn't really a daemon,\n# but we want to start it like one.\nstart-stop-daemon --start --pidfile /dev/null \\\n                  --startas /usr/bin/mandb --oknodo --chuid man \\\n                  $iosched_idle \\\n                  -- --no-purge --quiet\nIt's not changing group, which is why all the group ownerships in /var/cache/man are still root.\nBut why does mandb run as a different user at all? It could (probably) run just as well as root but it's processing input from a variety of sources (look at manpath). Running as its own user insulates the system from the process blowing up —or worse— being exploited by malformed, corrupted or malicious man pages.\nThe worst that could happen would only affect the man pages index. Boo hoo. You can confirm that with something like:\nsudo -u man find / -writable 2>/dev/null\n\nAnd you can use that approach to see how much damage any user could wreak on a system. It's a good idea to audit your file permissions (I just found out that any user could delete my entire music collection, for example).\n\nYou can peek at the database with accessdb. Here are a few random records:\n$ accessdb | shuf -n3\nfpurge -> \"- 3 3 1380819168 A - - gz purge a stream\"\nfcgetlangs -> \"FcGetLangs 3 3 1402007131 A - - gz Get list of languages\"\nipython -> \"- 1 1 1393443907 A - - gz Tools for Interactive Computing in Python.\"\n\nThough not entirely clear from the above, there are actually tab-separated fields in there:\n<name> -> <ext> <sec> <mtime> <ID> <ref> <comp> <whatis> \n\nYou can read more about the actual field contents in the technical manual.\n", "Q: package xxxx and python-xxxx I am trying to install the latest version of package xxxx.

Can I just apt-get remove python-xxxx? But would that cause dependencies problem? (Arrgh, I am spending more time on installation issues than getting actual work done...)\n\nA: If you're developing things*, I strongly recommend using virtualenv to create an entirely separate package environment for your development. This allows you to install anything without conflicting with the system... And perhaps more importantly, means the system updates won't conflict with your development (something I have lost hair to in the past).\nIf you have an installed program that depends on a newer version of a Python library, that's a bit tougher.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could remove the python-xxxx package from Apt and install with sudo pip, but that might cause dependency issues with apt.\n\n*You could leave the packaged version and just install-over with sudo pip. This is dirty in so many ways but can occasionally work. I still wouldn't recommend it.\n\n*Or you could properly package up the newer version of the library into a deb and install it. I've just found a super-quick way of doing this, so I'll go over that now.\nAs I mentioned in the third bullet, packaging python packages is pretty simple once you know how. I'm going to suggest using stdeb. Once installed it makes the whole thing as simple as sudo pypi-install xxxx but there is immediately an issue: The current repository version is bugged and won't work. A newer version works though, and no, the irony is not lost on me.\nYou need to enable the Proposed repos (look in Software Sources under updates), then sudo apt-get update and finally sudo apt-get install python-stdeb.\nOnce you have done that, you can simply call:\nsudo pypi-install xxxx\n\nAnd stdeb will generate a python-xxxx package with all the right version information and install it.\n* things not intended to be released to the wider Ubuntu community, where using pre-packaged dependencies is desirable.\n", "Q: How to install libqt4-webkit?

Rhythmbox asked if I wanted to install additional software, but the installation failed and returned this error message:\npackage tex-common 4.04 failed to install/upgrade: ErrorMessage: subprocess\ninstalled post-installation script returned error exit status 1\n\nI found this thread on launchpad about the bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tex-common/+bug/1236951\nwhich offered some suggestions about fixing the error, but the ones I have tried haven't worked for me.\nFirst, I tried these commands (although I think rm /etc/texmf/ didn't work, I got an error message telling me it was a directory). This didn't seem to fix the error.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge tex-common texlive-*\nsudo rm /etc/texmf/\nsudo apt-get install tex-common\nsudo apt-get install texlive-base\nsudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended\n\nI then tried:\nsudo apt-get purge tex-common\nsudo -E do-release-upgrade -d\nsudo -E apt-get -y install tex-common texlive-base texlive-latex-recommended\n\nbut again, it didn't seem to fix the problem.\nFinally, I tried the last suggestion in the thread:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall everything to do with emacs and xemacs\n(I used synaptic package manager, to find what to remove and to completely remove)\nI didn't actually do this step because a.) I didn't know if I had any issues with emacs and xemacs, and b.) because I don't know how to use Synaptic to do uninstall only the emacs and xemacs stuff.\n\n*Uninstall tex-common and all texlive-* files and:\n sudo rm -rf /etc/texmf\n\nThis time the command worked, which I assume is because this one removes the files in texmf, instead of the directory itself.\n\n*Remove all texlive files (if any) e.g.:\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/2014    \nrm -rf ~/.texlive2014\n\n\n*Install emacs24 then auctex using synaptic package manager\n\n*Install tex-common using synaptic package manager\nAgain, I didn't install emacs24 and auctex, and when it came to installing tex-common, I just tried:\nsudo apt-get install tex-common\n\n\n*Install texlive following the instructions on http://tug.org/texlive/\n(Installation from dpkg or Ubuntu software centre or synaptic package manager don't work for me.)\n\n*Add paths to /etc/environment as suggested by the installation program earlier.\nThat is, for the version I installed,\nto the end of the PATH line add :/usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-linux just before the closing\" and add 2 new lines\nINFOPATH=\":/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/info\"\nMANPATH=\":/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/man\"\n\n(without the colon, the manpath to everything except tex will be broken)\nI think I understood how to do this section, although it's the first time I've ever tried to set a path. Also, based on another thread, I used i386-linux instead of x86_64-linux.\n\n*Edit /etc/manpath.config by adding line\nMANPATH_MAP    /usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-linux    /usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/man\n\nafter the last MANPATH_MAP line that already exists.\nOriginally I wasn't able to edit the manpath.config file as it was read-only, so I had to open the file with sudo vim to edit it.\nAfter going through all of these steps and restarting, the problem is now worse, as I have to go Ubuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-34-generic (recovery mode) for anything to work. Otherwise there will be no icons along the top of the screen (such as battery, network, etc.) and the icons in the toolbar will not respond.\nWould anyone be able to help me with this?

Help please hope someone can help, this would be excellent.\nI’ve ubuntu DHCP server (10.04), which works great (many thanks to everyone who helped me in this excellent forum).\nThis server has 2 cards, eth0 for DHCP (172.20.32.11) and the other one eth1 (10.0.19.11), it’s basically a Vlan, but acts as access to the internet, the gateway for this Vlan is 10.0.19.5.\nAs mentioned, it works really great, no issues with it.\nAnyway, in my HDCP config I had to use eth1 as gateway for eht0, this means in clients devices the e.g ipconfig shows the ip of ethe 1 as gateway (10.0.19.11).\nWe have over 40 devices which have (must have) static IPs, so the gateway in those devices has to be the IP-address of eth1 (10.0.19.11), which is no problem.\nNow I need to configure a second ubuntu DHCP, and run them in failover / backup mode. The second server is configured but has to have different IP-Addresses, I use for eth 0 (for DHCP) 172.20.32.12 and for eth 1 10.0.19.12 (like the first one, it’s the same Vlan and acts as access to the internet, the gateway for this Vlan is 10.0.19.5.\nThe problem is, in case server 1 goes down then all devices with static IPs lose the access to the internet, and that’s logical because they look for eth 1 in server 1 which is down, so I would have to change the gateway in all devices with static IPs to the IP-address of eth1 in the second server.\nI’ve tried to use the gateway of the Vlan (10.0.19.5) in DHCP config instead of the ip addresses of the eth 1 but no success.\nIf I could use the same gateway for both servers (which would be 10.0.19.5) then my problem is solved.\nI’ve been searching in the net for an idea or solution but really nothing\nSo, please is there anyway to do this, maybe in the iptables? \nThe Iptable I am using at the moment is as follows:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\niptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\niptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT\n\nI would appreciate any help, this would be great \nMadona\n\nA: IMO, the best solution is creating a cluster with your two servers. The problem is you can't setup two routes to the same target/network (default gateway or more generally any route).\nClustering is grouping some computers which are seen by other as a single huge one. This can be used to achieve 'high availability' which I think, is your goal. Maybe you could take a look into this introduction to clustering particularly the 'High Availability Software' section. It contains a link to Linux HA software, which probably can do exactly what you want. Other solutions exist, of course.\nI can't tell you more, because I have no real experience of these configurations.\nHope this helps anyway... :-)\n", "Q: unable to install/recover jenkins after upgrading from ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 I did an upgrade of Ubuntu from 12.04 to 14.04 and was surprised to discover that my earlier installed and configured jenkins is broken.

And indeed there is: for a process with ID code $mypid, its child processes are listed in\n/proc/$mypid/task/$mypid/children\n\ne.g.\n$ cat /proc/3123/task/3123/children \n3131 3133\n\nSimilarly, you can get the parent process ID via the \"PPid\" entry in the file\n/proc/$mypid/task/$mypid/status\ne.g.\n$ grep PPid /proc/3131/task/3131/status\nPPid:   3123\n$ grep PPid /proc/3131/task/3131/status | cut -f2\n3123\n\nI'm not sure how portable this is beyond Linux systems, though.\n\nA: You are looking for the pstree command.\npstree by itself will list all the processes in a tree form (like lsblk does).

In SM Menubar mark \"Dependencies\" option, under \"View\", to have a visual feedback, showing parent and children process(es) like show in the screenshot below.\nI prefer the CL (Command Line) myself and suggest, that those who use Linux, in this case Ubuntu on a daily basis, wisely invest their time in learning the basic commands, over GUI Applications or at least are able to master both to a certain degree!\n\n\n\nA: if you want to see just the first-level children of a given parent process <pid> id look in /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children entry.\nNote that this file contains the pids of first-level child processes. for the whole process tree, do it recursively.\nthis https://lwn.net/Articles/475688/ contains more information about it.\n", "Q: What lines should be commented out in my sources.list file?

I would like to export all of my emails and all of my contacts from Outlook 2013 to Thunderbird on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I do not want to install Thunderbird on Windows to do this.\n\nA: There's a program available on the Ubuntu Software Center called readpst - this command line program can convert pst files from outlook (you e-mails) to a format that Thunderbird can read in.  It's been quite a while since I did this, so I don't recall if this also handled the contacts.\nreadpst -u -o ~/dirname foo.pst\n\nContacts:\nContacts may be more difficult to pull over, as there is no real easy way to export contacts.  I'll put this example together using outlook2013, which is the obnly version I currently have running.  You know that you can send an outlook contact as a vcard, and what you want to do is send all outlook contacts as a vcard - unfortunately outlook will not send multiple contacts in a single file.\nSo...  Open your contacts in Outlook, select them all, and choose to forward them as business cards (vfc files).  Send the mail to yourself.  This is a pain, I know.  When you get the mail, choose to save all attachments in a single folder somewhere.  You will now have a folder full of vcf files.\nOpen a cmd (dos) window, change to the directory with all the contacts, and enter the command\ncopy *.vfc contacts.vcf\n\nThis will create a single file called contacts.vcf, with all of your contacts in it.  Copy this file to your Ubuntu system, perhaps on a thumb drive?\nAlternatively you could perform this function on Ubuntu:  Create a directory in your home area, copy all of the vcf files from the e-mail into the home directory, open a terminal and navigate to this directory. The command would then be\ncat *vcf >> ~/contacts.vcf\n\nThis will create a 'contacts.vcf' file in your home directory, with all of the individual contact files placed into it.\nOpen Thunderbird, click on Address Book, and choose 'Tools->Import' from the menus.  Tell thunderbird you would like to import an address book, and use the vcf file import, locate your contacts.vcf file and away you go.\n", "Q: Where are ssh client private keys stored? On client, after I do ssh-add  to add my private key everything works fine, ssh-add -l lists key and I can connect to hosts that have corresponding public key, but nothing changes in .ssh dir as it supposed to.So my question is: How can I locate dir in which are stored private keys added by ssh-add ? \n\nA: ssh-add is not supposed to change anything in ~/.ssh. It tells the ssh-agent program which identities to add, and the ssh-agent program stores them in memory after asking for passphrases. So there is no such directory.\n\nA: ssh-add doesn't store anything locally or remotely on disk. This command loads your private key, asking once for its password, into the SSH Agent that was previously started.\nThe SSH Agent holds the private keys in memory only. When you launch the SSH client, it uses the private key from the SSH Agent, without asking for the private key password again, to authenticate against the target server.\nThe .ssh directory will contains (in the home directory of any user) :\n\n\n*\n\n*authorized_keys : list of public keys allowed to be used to connect to this server\n\n*config : optional file with configuration parameters for the SSH client\n\n*the public and private keys you've generated on this host for this user.\n\n*known_hosts : maintain a list of hosts to which you already connected together with a hash to detect if the host key has changed since the last time.\n\n\nA: ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nThis article shows you how to generate the key to the above path.

The name comes from the fact that AMD came up with it, but Intel adopted it and software for amd64 run just fine on Intel CPUs. Since amd64 extends x86, x86 can't run software written for amd64/x86-64.\nMacbooks used to have CPUs of the PowerPC architecture, but they have long since shifted to the amd64/x86-64 architecture. A separate image is offered for Macs not because of optimization, but because of booting issues caused by the UEFI implementation in Macs (see What is different about the Mac ISO image?).\nUbuntu offers three options for the x86 (commonly called 32-bit) and its successor architecture amd64/x86-64 :\n\n\n*\n\n*x86 image\n\n*amd64 image, UEFI/BIOS bootable.\n\n*amd64 image, BIOS bootable (i.e., UEFI systems will boot them in the Legacy boot mode).\n\n", "Q: The kernel use which scheduling algorithm? I know there are a lot of scheduling algorithm for processor. like FCFS ( first come first served ) Or SJF (short job first) and so on. How to know the kernel using which algorithm ?\n\nA: Neither:\n\nSince Linux 2.6.23\nCon Kolivas's work, most significantly his implementation of \"fair scheduling\" named \"Rotating Staircase Deadline\", inspired Ingo Molnár to develop the Completely Fair Scheduler as a replacement for the earlier O(1) scheduler, crediting Kolivas in his announcement.\nThe Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) uses a well-studied, classic scheduling algorithm called fair queuing originally invented for packet networks. Fair queuing had been previously applied to CPU scheduling under the name stride scheduling.\nThe fair queuing CFS scheduler has a scheduling complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of tasks in the runqueue. Choosing a task can be done in constant time, but reinserting a task after it has run requires O(log N) operations, because the run queue is implemented as a red-black tree.\nCFS is the first implementation of a fair queuing process scheduler widely used in a general-purpose operating system.\n\nIf you're willing to look at the source code, sched/fair.c implements CFS, and sched/rt.c implements the POSIX-required FIFO (or what you'd call FCFS) and Round-Robin (RR) algorithms for realtime processes.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel Documentation\n\n*IBM developerWorks article on CFS\n\n*Linux Journal article on CFS\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade from 12.04LTS to 14.04 I have been trying to upgrade to 14.04 for several days now, but every time I get this error message:\nW:Failed to fetch gzip:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/security.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_trusty-security_universe_i18n_Translation-en  \nEncountered a section with no Package: header, E:Some index files failed to download.

I can get it to work through there, but it's inconvenient to pull up my virtual box and transfer the files over to it anytime I want to print.\n\nA: I installed the driver (B1160w_Linux_v1.04_Driver from the dell site) on a fresh 14.04 machine. The printer worked without a problem.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I downloaded this 1.04 version and then installed it as follows using the Terminal. It seems to be working.\ncd\ncd Downloads\ngunzip B1160w_Linux_v1.04_Driver.tar.gz \ntar -xvf B1160w_Linux_v1.04_Driver.tar \ncd cdroot\ncd Linux/\nsudo ./install.sh\n\n", "Q: DVD Drive Burner Not Working I'm attempting to burn Bodhi Linux to a blank DVD.

I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 using Wubi 12.04 and I now wish to upgrade to a full installation of Ubuntu 14.04, Before attempting to upgrade through the update center I did some research on upgrading from a Wubi installation (alongside windows) to a full installation making Ubuntu primary and only OS and found that it is in fact doable through the update center however it is just highly recommended to perform a full backup before doing so. I have now finished backing up all the data I need to worry about and began the upgrade process through the update center and received the following error:\nYour graphics hardware may not be fully supported in Ubuntu 14.04.\nRunning the 'unity' desktop environment is not fully supported by your graphics hardware. You will maybe end up in a very slow environment after the upgrade. Our advice is to keep the LTS version for now. For more information see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/UpdateManagerWarningForUnity3D Do you still want to continue with the upgrade?\nMy questions are as follows: A. Isnt 14.04 a LTS version??? B, What are your recomendations in order to ensure my graphics driver is installed correctly and im not stuck with bad configs/install?\n\nA: When it comes to the error it is saying that 14.04, although an lts release, does not have unity2d as you are probably using on your current computer with 12.04, and would have to try and run a full unity3d environment with software acceleration instead of hardware. What are your computer's specs? Also to make it a primary installation you can download boot-repair (google it for instructions on doing so) and elect to install it in the mbr of your drive, then update grub. It will most likely have ubuntu as the default boot option and may even have an option to boot windows below it. If you want to just use ubuntu after that, just delete the windows partition (after backing up everything you want to save) then run sudo update-grub /dev/sd<letter of the primary drive, not a subpartition> then resize the ubuntu partition(s) CAREFULLY with gparted to take up the full disk.\n", "Q: My IDE keeps crashing instantly: How do I diagnose?

In Windows, I have used CallStation for many years.  You can find out more about it at http://imptec.com/callstation.htm and be sure to click the FEATURES and SCREENSHOTS buttons at the top of this link as well for more information.\nI am looking for a Linux equivalent of CallStation where calls can be answered or hung-up on, faxes can be received, Caller ID is shown, calls can be recorded in their entirety, etc.  Is there anything like this for Linux?\nIn fact now in Windows (I believe this started with either Windows XP or Vista) calls and recordings can only be recorded for like 55 seconds.  I have heard it is because Microsoft changed something with Windows' voice modem support.  I am hoping Linux does not suffer from this.\n\nA: Sounds like a job for mgetty:\n Mgetty is a versatile program to handle all aspects of a modem under Unix.\n .\n The program 'mgetty' allows you to use a modem for handling external\n logins, receiving faxes and using the modem as a answering machine without\n interfering with outgoing calls.\n .\n This package includes basic modem data capabilities. Install mgetty-fax to\n get the additional functionality for fax. Install mgetty-voice to get the\n functionality to operate voice modems.\n .\n Mgetty is also configurable to select programs other than login for\n special connections (eg: uucico, fido or other programs) depending on the\n login userid. It also supports caller-id if the modem and phone line\n supply it, and can deny connections based on originating telephone number.\n\nNote that mgetty will require you to be comfortable with command-line utilities and modifying configuration files, as it has no graphical, friendly front-end. Feel free to google for \"vgetty frontend\" to get pointers to options for this need (sorry, I can't help there as I don't use either mgetty or any frontend for it).\n\nA: I ordered this replacement modem...\nhttp://www.rosewill.com/products/1164/ProductDetail_Overview.htm\nI also found an eBay auction for a used U.S. Robotics 3CP2976-OEM hardware voice modem.\nAfter receiving both modems today, I decided not to try the Rosewill as it doesn't state if it supports Caller ID on the box I received.  The U.S. Robotics 3CP2976-OEM hardware voice modem is working perfectly.  I have CallStation installed on Windows XP in VirtualBox and all is well.\nIt would still be nice if there was a Linux version of CallStation.  It is just that awesome.\n", "Q: Wireless Drivers for Broadcom BCM 4321 (14e4:4329) will not stay connected to a wireless network So, I'm not necessary new to Linux, I just never took the time to learn it, so please, bare with me.\nI just swapped out one of my wireless cards from one computer to another. This wireless card in question would be a \"Broadcom BCM4321 (14e4:4329)\" or actually a \"Netgear WN311B Rangemax Next 270 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapter\", but that's not important. I've tried (but probably screwed up in the process) installing the \"wl\" , \"b43\" and \"brcmsmac\" drivers, or at least I think I did. Currently I have only the following drivers loaded:\neugene@EugeneS-PCu:~$ lsmod | grep \"brcmsmac\\|b43\\|ssb\\|bcma\\|wl\"\nb43                   387371  0 \nbcma                   52096  1 b43\nmac80211              630653  1 b43\ncfg80211              484040  2 b43,mac80211\nssb_hcd                12869  0 \nssb                    62379  2 b43,ssb_hcd\n\nThe main issue is that with most of the drivers available that I've installed, they will find my wireless network but, they will only stay connected for about a minute with abnormally slow speed and then all of a sudden disconnect. Currently, the computer is hooked into another to share it's connect so that I can install drivers from the internet instead of loading them on to a flash drive and doing it offline.\nIf anyone has any insight to the problem, that would be awesome. If not, I'll probably just look up how to install the Windows closed source driver.\nEdit 1: Even when I try the method here, as suggested when this was marked as a duplicate, I still can't stay connected to a wireless network.\nEdit 2: After discussing my issue with @Luis, he opened my question back up and told me to include the tests/procedures in the comments. Basically I did this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Read the first answer of the link above when this question was marked as duplicate which involved installing removing bcmwl-kernel-source and instead install firmware-b43-installer and b43-fwcutter.\n\n*No change of result and contacted Luis in the comments, who then told me to try the second answer which involved removing my previous mistake and installing bcmwl-kernel-source\n\n*Now the Network Manger (this has happend before, but usally I fixed it by using a different driver) even recognizes WiFi exist (both non-literal and literal). Luis who then suggested sudo rfkill unblock all\n\n*rfkill unblock all didn't return anything, so I decide to try sudo rfkill list all. Returns nothing (no wonder rfkill unblock all did nothing).\n\n*I enter lsmod | grep \"brcmsmac\\|b43\\|ssb\\|bcma\\|wl\" and that returns nothing.\n\n*Try loading the driver by entering sudo modprobe b43 and try lsmod | grep \"brcmsmac\\|b43\\|ssb\\|bcma\\|wl\" again. Returns this:\neugene@Eugenes-uPC:~$ sudo modprobe b43\neugene@Eugenes-uPC:~$ lsmod | grep \"brcmsmac\\|b43\\|ssb\\|bcma\\|wl\"\nb43                   387371  0 \nbcma                   52096  1 b43\nmac80211              630653  1 b43\ncfg80211              484040  2 b43,mac80211\nssb_hcd                12869  0 \nssb                    62379  2 b43,ssb_hcd\nSo to recap: Currently Network Manager doesn't recognize Wireless exists, b43 drivers are loaded and I've currently hardwired a connect from my laptop to the computer that's causing this.\nEdit 3: So I just decided to try again to install bcmwl-kernel-source. It was able to find my network and it tried to connect. However, in never really succeeded and kept asking me for the network pass phrase. I give it the correct one every time but it keeps asking about three times and then stops trying. At this point I'm starting to research how to use ndiswrapper but haven't had any luck with that either.\nEdit 4: After crying in a corner for about a month, I've decided to do a fresh install of Ubuntu and install the Broadcom STA drivers (wl.ko) right off their website. It does indeed find networks and seems to know how to connect to them, however, It will connect to them for a few minutes with very slow connection speed and then just drop. That was with the Wicd Network Manager too, with just plain old network-manager, it will keep asking for my password to connect to the network never actually connecting to the network.\n\nA: I have this solved in 2019!\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all drivers.\n\n*Install only:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer b4cutter\n\n\n*Run:\nnano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nPut # before the following:\n# replaced by b43 and ssb.\n#blacklist bcm43xx\n\nReboot.\nIT WORKS!\nI also replaced grub with refind btw.\nMacBookAir 2.1.\n\nA: I also have a Broadcom BCM4321 wireless card but\nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nworks perfectly for me on ubuntu 14.04.1\n\nA: I also have this exact card, and have also recently switched to Linux. I also did extensive testing, and ended up just buying a cheap Linksys AE2500, which works fine for me through ndiswrapper. The reason is simple: The Netgear card works in the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, but not in the 64-bit version, and I have 8GB of RAM in my system.\nHonestly, I can't remember if it's the b43 drivers or the wl ones, but it's not really that hard to switch them out thanks to the Software & Updates GUI. Besides, if I remember right, whichever ones were loaded by default were the ones that worked.\ntl;dr version: Try the 32-bit version of Ubuntu. Strange as it may be, it worked for me, though you'd be sacrificing certain abilities, especially if you have more than 4GB of RAM.\n\nA: I have the same card BCM4321 (14e4:4329) and came here by Google. Thanks for your help, maybe I could help you too.\nI am using Kubuntu and Lubuntu (both 64bits), and spent some time trying to understand why the same card works fine in Kubuntu but don't exists in Lubuntu, both having bcmwl-kernel-source installed. Using lsmod as you suggest now I think seems that has a conflict because of many drivers installed.\nI suggest you try:\n\n\n*\n\n*run lsmod | grep \"brcmsmac\\|b43\\|ssb\\|bcma\\|wl\" to list installed drivers\n\n*for each drive, run sudo modprobe -r drivername to disable it; disable all of them\n\n*then run sudo modprobe wl to enable just one of them\n\n\nA: sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nAdd # in front of \"blacklist bcm43xx\". Then reboot.\nThis fixed the problem for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu - Nvidia drivers causes weird behaviour I installed the latest nvidia drivers after many dirty attemps (I'm not used to linux and using console to install drivers) and well, finaly aparently I made it.\nOne thing I noticed is that when I'm browsing the web, the pictures (like browsing facebook photos) appear a lot darker than they looked before installing the drivers.\nSecond thing is that part of UI controls of programs, like Mozilla, Netbeans and others just flicker and it is very uncomfortable because it is very often.\nI am using UBUNTU 14.04 and I want to uninstall the nvidia drivers and use the default ones.\nHow do I do it?\n\nA: Guessing you installed nvidias driver for ubuntu:\nNavigate to the directory you have stored the .run-file, there\nsudo ./NVIDIA-linux*.run --uninstall\n\nIf you have saved your old configurations they can be restored in the process.\n", "Q: How to reset Unity appearance settings I was curious. Someone said Kubuntu is awesome. So I installed it (sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop).\nI didn't like it. Keyboard shortcuts that I became familiar with in Unity weren't working. It just felt too \"Kids R Us\" for me, like a toy OS, so I logged back into Unity and noticed some oddities. All my menus were jacked. The background of menus are now black and the text IN the menu is a dark grey so I can barely read my menus. A new square icon has appeared in the top panel with a DO-NOT-ENTER icon on it. Upon clicking it gives me ENGLISH, CHARACTER MAP, KEYBOARD LAYOUT, AND TEXT ENTRY SETTINGS.\nGoogle chrome's tabs are now a weird white/grey gradient and my navigation buttons (back, forward, refresh) are a bubbly cartoon-ish blue and green.\nSo, I ran sudo apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop && sudo apt-get autoremove and rebooted. I still have 3 extra \"skin(?)/distros(?)\" available to me at the login screen when I click the Ubuntu icon. So looks like not everything got removed.\nAny ideas? I really hope I don't have to re-install everything, again. And I learned \"unity --reset\" has been deprecated :(\n\nA: I've experienced almost the exact same scenario (the main difference being me not using Chrome but Firefox, where I've experienced similar phenomena). What solved the issue for me was to remove ~/.config/gtk-3.0. (To make a backup and remove it run mv ~/.config/gtk-3.0{,.bak}.)\nBy the way, the indicator with the do-not-enter icon is the input source selector. After solving the issue it should show \"En\" rather than the do-not-enter icon. In any case it seems you don't need it (as you haven't got other options than English to select from), so you can just remove it from the text entry settings (disable \"Show current input source in the menu bar\").\nAs for the extraneous \"skins\" at login, they are defined in /usr/share/xsessions - you can remove the files corresponding to those options you no longer want from this directory.\n\nA: rm -rf ~/.local/ ~/.cache/ ~/.config/ ~/.kde/ will reset most everything as far as your account goes. You could get more fine-grained than that if you looked in all of the \"dot\" directories for anything KDE related. You can also run dpkg-reconfigure lightdm to try to fix the login screen issues. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Tweak natural scrolling not persistent I am using Ubuntu tweak on Ubuntu 12.04 and the natural scrolling setting does not persist after restart.

It should look like 14.0.0.177-r1.\nNote: This is not working for chromium 36 but seems to work for other versions of chromium.\n", "Q: How do you change display resolution of VMware Player in KDE Plasma 5? I installed the project NEON ppa in Ubuntu 14.04 to check out the new KDE in a VM. I can't seem to figure out how to change the display resolution. Its stuck at 800x600.\nEdit: I'm using vmware player 6.0.3 with vmware tools installed. The unity desktop session runs at 1440x900. If I log out and switch to plasma5 session, its stuck at 800x600.\n\nA: I have the same issue and have the following workaround:\nIt is possible to set the resolution from a command line using 'xrandr'. Running just  xrandr  allows you to see the current resolution and the other valid resolutions.  \nFrom a command line you can run  'xrandr -s 1024x768'  and the screen in VMware will reset to that size! \nYou can even set this at KDE startup by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*click KDE start icon\n\n*select System Settings\n\n*select Startup and Shutdown\n\n*click Add Program...\n\n*enter 'xrandr -s 1024x768' in the text box\n\n*be sure the \"run in Terminal\" checkbox is checked\n\n*follow the rest of the prompts to set it as a startup command.  \n\n\nThe next time you log in, it will start at 800x600 but at the end of the login you will see the screen resize!\n\nA: If you try the xrandr command and it doesn't work: \n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the VM \n\n*Go to display setting in Oracle VirtualBox and \n\n*Change the graphics controller\n\n\nIt may take a couple of tries to find one that works.\n\nA: Go into the KDE menu and select Settings\nGo to the Workspace section and look in the subsection labeled Startup and Shutdown\nGo to the tab labeled Background Services. Look in the list that is located to the right and look for one that is titled KScreen 2\nLocate the pause button for this service which is located to the right side of the screen right across from the KScreen 2 label.\nClick on the pause button then uncheck the box that is located to the left of the label KScreen 2, then click on the apply button at the bottom of that menu on the right side.\nThen go to the Display tab and then select the screen resolution that you desire and then click on the apply button at the bottom on the right side of the screen.\nMake sure that you save the settings because of the window management of KDE and the KScreen 2 service that is running in the background. Unless you are installing on bare metal the system cannot detect a virtual screen size in order to auto select a different resolution.\n\nA: Go to view → autosize → autofitguest in VMware vm window. Now stretch the vm VMware window and it will autosize for you\n", "Q: Excessive Power Consumption by ethernet socket Recently I have been having problems with power consumption in Ubuntu, I am not exactly sure when this started but roughly about two weeks ago. Idle my laptop used about 9-10W of power, or at least it has done for the past two years. Recently it uses 16-18W and I have been trying to find out why. Using powertop it seems that my Network Interface is using 10W+ constantly even when not in use i.e. cable disconnected. \n\nI have even seen it go as high as 30W for Network Interface: eth0 (r8169). Which seems like maybe a fault with PowerTop but my power usage reported elsewhere rises by the same amount. \nI am not an expert but this seems queer. Is this normal and just something that I haven't noticed before? \nIt seems odd that Wifi uses barely any power but Ethernet uses a staggering amount, typically about 9-10W making my power usage roughly double what it was.  \nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using another driver for my network card - this seemed to drop power to around 5-7W mainly on the upper end of that but I didn't really use it long enough to test properly\n\n*Used an older kernel - no effect whatsoever. \n\n\nIs there a way to correct this behaviour if it isn't normal?\nI have added the services that were discovered by Zenmap:\n\nI have an Apache server running and also have a local Windows network, unfortunately I don't see anything untoward. \n---EDIT---\nI have just disabled networking via Network Manager and in PowerTop the Network Interface eth0 disappeared from the list, however the discharge rate did not go down by the same amount that eth0 was taking up (about 9W when networking was disabled) so it does seem that PowerTop is misreporting eth0's power usage. I've added a screenshot below. \n\nEven so something is using more power and not appearing in PowerTop. \n\nA: Well I have discovered what was causing my problems. Firstly it seems that PowerTop is misreporting power usage, the numbers never seem to add up, even after resolving this issue they still don’t.\nIt turns out that this issue was due to the recent update of the Intel drivers via the Intel Graphics installer. I also had Nvidia drivers and Nvidia Primus for my Nvidia card and it seems somewhere along the way they were either conflicting or had messed each other up. \nFirstly I removed the Intel Drivers following the instructions in this Ask Ubuntu answer\nThis downgraded my drivers but didn’t completely resolve the issue. It seemed that my Nvidia card wasn’t completed being turned off, so I removed all the Nvidia drivers using:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nThen I installed bumblebee instead following the instructions in this Ask Ubuntu answer\nOnce that was done I rebooted and my Nvidia card was definitely off and my power usage was back to normal. \n\nEthernet power usage still seems high even at 3W, especially as I was using wifi at the time, but I think that PowerTop is just reporting it wrong. Apologies to anyone who spent time on this, I should have realised it was the graphics drivers but PowerTop threw me. \n\nA: Install either zenmap (GUI) or netmap (CLI). Both of these tools will scan for running services, open ports etc. This will help you target the source of the activity. And if you ever feel like checking out what's going on in realtime etherape is a really good tool that shows all network-connections IPs and protocols. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have a printer you might want to disable cups and\ncups-browsed. I've noticed that sometimes cups will get stuck in a loop trying to find a printer when there is no device to connect to.\n\n*If you're not using pnp or any multicast you may want to disable\navahi-daemon.\n\n*If you set up a static configuration instead of using DHCP you will\nno longer need to use dhclient.\n\n*Check to see if you are running some kind of a server. VLC is just\none of many mediaplayers that can be set up for streaming of media\nthroughout the local network.\n\n*If there are any Windows computers on your network, there is a\nsecurity flaw in Windows that causes those computers to incessantly\nannounce themselves to other computers on the network (I guess it's\nlike router advertisements) although, it seems that would be less likely to cause your power consumption to be so high but could be one of many smaller contributing factors.\n", "Q: How to install Firefox Aurora from a terminal? I want to install Firefox Aurora in Ubuntu 14.04 from the terminal (I know there are other ways) but I can't.\nI've downloaded firefox-33.0a2.ca.linux-i686.tar.bz2 (linked from the download page) and extracted it. But I don't know how to install it from the terminal. There is no README file.\nI've read that I should use the following commands:\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\nIt doesn't work, it throws me:\nbash: ./configure: No such file or directory\n\nAlso tried chmod a+x configure neither worked, it throws:\nchmod: cannot access ‘configure’: No such file or directory\n\nI can't find anything else about on the net. Running ./firefox, as muru suggested, throws:\n./firefox: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nAnd that error is shown for sudo ./firefox as well.\nThis is a 64-bit Ubuntu system, and libstdc++6 package is installed at version 4.8.2-19ubuntu1. Purging and reinstalling the package doesn't make any difference to the problem.\nIs there something that I'm missing? By the way, what about uninstalling it?\n\nA: As muru says, since you've downloaded a binary build of Firefox and not source code, running ./configure and make commands does not apply to your situation. Instead, you run it with ./firefox from the folder you unpacked.\nThis does not work now, but it should work nce you have the necessary libraries that Firefox. The problem is that you have a 64-bit Ubuntu system (amd64), but you're attempting to run the 32-bit version of Firefox Aurora (i386).\nIf you really want to run 32-bit Aurora on 64-bit Ubuntu, you can:\nYour 64-bit Ubuntu system is capable of running 32-bit executables, but most of them, including this one, require the 32-bit versions of some system libraries. Those versions are available for your 64-bit system, but they are not installed by default.\nSo, if you really want to test the 32-bit version of Aurora on your 64-bit system, you can install libstdc++6 for the i386 architecture, by running these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libstdc++:i386\n\nThat should fix the error you're currently having, though you might instead get a similar error about another missing library. You could then fix that the same way, and eventually you'll have all the needed libraries installed.\nTo find out what package to install to get a particular file (in that case, it was libstdc++.so.6), you can use the Ubuntu package database. In the textbox under \"Search the contents of packages,\" put in the filename and click Search.\nThe search results may look complicated at first, but it's usually navigable if you keep in mind that 32-bit library .so files on a 64-bit Ubuntu system are usually stored in the /usr/lib32 directory. In any case, feel free to expand your question if you have further difficulties.\nBut I'd suggest you test 64-bit Aurora instead:\nTo get the 64-bit version of Firefox Aurora, download a snapshot archive with x86_64 instead of i386 in its name. In this case, you should use firefox-33.0a2.ca.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2 instead of firefox-33.0a2.ca.linux-i686.tar.bz2.\nYou can get the 64-bit version by using a download link in the \"Linux 64-bit\" column of the Aurora download page, instead of the \"Linux\" column which lists downloads for the 32-bit versions.\nIn this case, the file you probably want is:\n\n*\n\n*http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-aurora-l10n/firefox-33.0a2.ca.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2\nThat's the current latest Aurora build for 64-bit Linux in the Catalan language. But note that in the future, there will be a later version (so in the future, that link should serve only as an example of what the URL looks like, rather than being the best download).\n", "Q: Running IE with virtualbox When trying to run IE11 in Virtualbox (Ubuntu 14.04 host) I get the following:\nERROR: VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration is not available on your system. Certain guests (e.g. OS/2 and QNX) require this feature and will fail to boot without it.                       \ndoing some research I found out that in order to enable VT-x/AMD-V I need to make sure that:\n1. The CPU you're using actually supports hardware virtualization.\n2. Hardware virtualization is enabled in your bios.\n3. Lastly that it's enabled in your vbox configuration.                                                                                                                                  \nI believe that my hardware supports virtualization since I see 'svm' in color when running this command: grep --color vmx /proc/cpuinfo\n(based on How do I enable hardware virtualization technology (VT-x) for use in Virtualbox?).                                                          \nin order to meet #3 i need to enable it in vbox but the Acceleration tab in my vbox is disabled.\nI did some searching and found this thread: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1356653\nIt suggested the following: vboxmanage modifyvm IE11 --longmode off\nI did that but it didn't solve my issue.                                                                                                                                                 \nHere is the IE11 that I use (i took it from modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools)                                                                                           \nThanks!       \n\nA: Virtualbox as available in the Ubuntu repositories does have VT-x support enabled. If the tab is not available, it could be that VT-x is not enabled in your BIOS. This is possibly needed even if vmx shows in cpuinfo. Reboot your system, go into the BIOS setup and look for the setting to enable virtualization somewhere in there. It's most likely disabled. You say \"I believe that my hardware supports virtualization\", but to know for sure, you need to go into the BIOS and enable it explicitly.\n", "Q: How to search strings inside files like in Windows without search monkey?

In other words, rfkill commands have no affect on a hard blocked device. \nCheck for a physical switch or possibly an fn key that can toggle the wireless on and off. Make sure wireless is enabled in BIOS.

I have had the same problem, and if you haven't got your wireless drivers you would need to install them and then (if not already) turn on your wireless card.

Yesterday when I turned on my home laptop I got the 'Failed to start session' error and could not log in. I was only able to fix this today, searching for a solution at the office. I was effectively locked out of my laptop for more than 24 hours; in over 5 years of Ubuntu this was the most serious situation I experienced.\nThe original question here at AskUbuntu refers to a failed upgrade, but I ran into this problem months after upgrading to 14.04.

This allows you to review these packages so you can make your own call on weather or not you want to take the chance of upgrading to a new kernel other package. \n\nOn the other hand, to blindly run all updates with no regard for the consequences this may have on the stability of your system, or if you're just feeling dangerous, you can run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\ninstead. This will install kernel upgrades and other packages that may possibly make changes to the system that could temporarily effect stability or otherwise change the way things work. \nIf you've used 14.04 this long and are only now experiencing a problem, I wouldn't expect too many problems in the future as most of the problems that exist are bugs that get dealt with as time goes on. Just stick to apt-get upgrade when you need to be safe and stable and maybe only do the apt-get dist-upgrade when you know it's not going to interfere with work if there happens to be a problem.\n", "Q: Is there anywhere where I can get Ubuntu installed for me?

I've done that, but cannot for the life of me figure out how to change the options from selected to deselected in the interface presented. Any hints? (I need to disable \"SMB password synchronization\" if it makes a difference.)\n\n\nA: You press the spacebar to select/deselect options, and use the arrow keys to move up and down the list.\n\nA: Then I guess you have to use spacebar to uncheck that option by using Up and Down arrow key.\n\nA: Just simply check inside  /etc/pam.d/ for \"SMB password synchronization\" If it is there then rename these files. Not finding the file named after the service requesting authentication, PAM will fallback to the (hopefully) very secure /etc/pam.d/other. If you later find that you need one of these programs, you can simply rename the file to its original name and everything will work as it was intended. Hope so it works :)\n", "Q: sudo password for terminal I'm quite  new to Linux. I am currently using Ubuntu on my HP Celeron laptop.\nI've been having trouble with my  wifi on my laptop. I've tried pressing the button to activate my wifi but it doesn't seem to be responding.\nSo, I'm trying to run this troubleshooting command: \nsudo lshw -C network\n\nBut when i try AND PRESS enter, it asks for a sudo password. First of all, What is it? Secondly,  Where do I get it? I'd really appreciate some help. I need to get back on  the network at work asap. \nThanks.\n\nA: Sudo is for users that have been put on the Sudoers list; in other words, users that have been granted limited administration rights. This allows people to modify otherwise restricted things, without direct root access, and allows for effective logging of such actions.\nThe sudo password is your password. For example,\n[sudo] password for bowser:\n\nI would then type my password.\n\nA: The default sudo password for your installation (I am assuming you are a new user) is the password you set for yourself, when you set up Ubuntu.  By default, you are a member of the sudoers list, and the system is asking you to verify who you are.\n", "Q: Chromium stays in backgound I'm running Thunderbird 31.0, FireFox 13.0 and Chromium 36.0.1985.143 on Ubuntu 14.04. Both Thunderbird and Chromium are open and running.\nWhen I click on a link in an email in Thunderbird I expected to switch from Thunderbird to Chromium to the foreground to display the website associated with the link. What happens instead is that Chromium wiggles in the Launcher and Thunderbird is still displayed. I have to click on Chromium to see the website. I don't have this problem with FireFox 13.0.\nIs this normal behaviour with Chromium on Ubuntu or can you change this so that you switch from Thunderbird to Chromium automatically?\n\nA: To the best of my recollection, if the browser window is open, be it Chromium or Firefox, it will only shake the icon and not bring the window to the front. I do not believe there is a way to bring the browser window to the front in this situation without getting deeper than a toggle switch in your settings.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install CompizConfig Settings Manager\n\n*Go to: General Options → Focus & Raise Behaviour tab\n\n*Then change Focus Prevention Level to Off\n", "Q: Unable to install Inkscape on ubuntu 14.04 Hi I am new to Linux Ubuntu 14.04.

When it reboots after the install, uname -r says:\n3.5.0-17-generic\n\n..this means that no modules have loaded for the kernel that is actually installed (3.13.0-32-generic).\nDoes anyone know why this kernel should be installed via the install process? Is it an artifact of using Unetbootin? Booting into the Unetbootin image gives the correct kernel, and thus the modules load.\nKnowing why is one thing, but I'm not sure how to remedy it now. Because no modules are loaded, I can't connect to the network or connect a USB drive.\nI've tried update-grub, which seems to find the correct kernel, but doesn't seem to tell the system to boot from it.\nI've also tried selecting the kernel at boot time using the \"Advanced Options for Ubuntu\", and the 3.13.x kernel is the only one listed. Selecting this lead to the 3.5.x kernel stubbornly loading..\nI'm a fairly accomplished sysadmin, but this one has me flummoxed :) Can anyone help?\n\nA: OK, I worked this out. It was a Unetbootin issue. I hadn't formatted the USB stick before putting a new image on there, and as a result it was installing the kernel from the previously installed version (on the USB) to the machines hard drive.\nI'm not so sure why the live boot image seemed to work properly if that was the case, but in the end, the fix was to format the USB stick completely and re-image using Unetbootin.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot into a live system from USB, DVD, or CD and make sure you have internet access.\n\n*Mount your Ubuntu installation, e. g. by opening the corresponding partition in Nautilus or with Gnome Disks. It should be mounted somewhere under /media/ubuntu or /media but I'll refer to the mountpoint by [mountpoint] later.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a separate /boot or /var partition, things are a bit harder, because you need to mount those manually under [mountpoint]. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you're very likely unconcerned by this issue.\n\n\n*Open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get update\napt-get download linux-image-3.13.0-24-generic\nsudo dpkg --install --root=[mountpoint] linux-image-*.deb\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're not on Trusty, look up the most recent kernel package version for your Ubuntu release on https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux#packages_list and replace it in the 2nd line.\n\n*On older 32-bit (x86) releases you'll want to append -pae to line 2.\n\n*If you're on a less common architecture (PowerPC or some ARM), you may need a different kernel package type. Instead of generic, enter whatever your architecture requires. Again, if you don't know what I'm talking about, you're very likely not concerned by this unless the 2nd line comes back with an error that the package doesn't exist for your architecture.\n\n\n*If all of the above commands worked, you can reboot now. Don't forget to update your kernel to a more recent version, if available.\n\nA: EDIT: The simple solution is just to recreate the USB stick with Ubuntu's own Startup Disk Creator instead of UNetbootin, or try to format the stick first, as another answer suggests.\nI also ended up having the wrong kernel on first boot of Ubuntu 14.04 after installing with an USB stick created with UNetbootin. The symptoms were that the boot partition could not be mounted, since there were no ext2 drivers available for the kernel.\nThe strange thing was that the kernel in /boot seemed to be the correct one, at least based on it's name. However, only the name was correct. The kernel in the file was old, which could be seen from it's modification date. The problem was solved by downloading the actual kernel package with  \napt-get download\n\nunpacking it with  \ndpkg -x\n\nand copying the (identically named, but different size) kernel image to the boot partition.\nI carried out the fix operation by starting the Live Ubuntu with the same UNetbootin USB stick, from where I could mount the actual boot partition (sda1 on my system).\n", "Q: Can't Install Wine, held Packages I am getting this error: \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n udev : Depends: libudev1 (= 204-5ubuntu20.2) but 204-5ubuntu20.4 is to be installed\nE: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.\n\nI've tried to apt-get dist-upgrade and I got the same message: \nThe following packages have been kept back:\n  libudev1 udev\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.\n\nI am using ubuntu 64bits 14.04\nThank you guys!\n\nA: Try running the following command in your terminal\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine1.7 winetricks\n\n\nA: 1st command executed properly\nthe others didn't:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo: add-apt-repository: command not found\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install wine1.7 winetricks\nE: The update command takes no arguments\n", "Q: Does driver exist for Trendnet AC1200 Dual Band Wireless adapter for Ubuntu 14.04 64bit?

What would be nice is if it told us what packages could not be upgraded.\nAs part of the release upgrade, Ubuntu does the equivalent of a regular apt-get dist-upgrade, the normal way that it updates packages to new versions.  As part of this it needs to fully check dependencies for all packages it is going to modify, to ensure that, for example, a package is not going to be incompatible with other packages.\nUbuntu will have thoroughly tested the update procedure for all their packages, and ensured that there are upgrade paths for people upgrading.  However where this can fall apart is when you have installed packages from sources other than the official Ubuntu repositories.  Specifically, if these packages are marked as depending on official Ubuntu packages.  This can be the case with packages installed from PPAs or backports, which typically depend on system libraries in Ubuntu.  If you try to upgrade Ubuntu without upgrading these packages at the same time, those packages may continue to depend on previous versions of important system libraries, making a full scale upgrade of Ubuntu impossible.\nSteps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*For any package installed from outside the official repositories (including packages installed from PPAs), make sure the source you installed them from is still included in your software sources and that source also includes a version of the package compatible with the newer version of Ubuntu.\n\n*For any packages installed from outside official repositories where the original source is no longer in your software sources, or where they don't provide a version of the package compatible with the new version of Ubuntu, uninstall those packages prior to upgrade of Ubuntu.\n\nA: try running \nsudo update-manager -d\nor if you've started the update already and things broke down it's likely ubuntu already disabled all the repos that are giving you issues so do\nsudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\ngood luck!\n\nA: *\n\n*If the upgrade fails, some information may be found in /var/log/dist-upgrade.\n\n*To reproduce the errors visibly: make a copy of /etc/apt/sources.list and edit the file replacing old repositories with new ones.

The graphical installer is designed to be run from a full (live) Ubuntu desktop, and there was not enough demand for the text-based installer (for the desktop version, anyway) to justify the effort and complexity required to maintain two separate versions, each with its own code and quirks and bugs and updates. The two installers used different methods to install Ubuntu, so the developers were also afraid it would result in a variety of \"standard installations\", which could confuse users and complicate technical support, troubleshooting, and software updates.\nMy guess is the message you are seeing is a vestige of the time when the text installer was still a part of the normal desktop ISO; you could report that message as a bug, if you'd like.\nThere is still a text-based installer for Ubuntu Server, the Lubuntu \"Alternate ISO\", and for the Network Installer (a very small ISO that fetches the majority of packages from online mirrors at time of installation, as opposed to fetching them from the DVD or USB stick). Of these, I would recommend the Network installer, as it is a relatively small download and will allow you to install a full GNOME/KDE/MATE/XFCE/LXDE/Unity desktop from the text interface.\nI'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news...

Can anyone point me in the right direction to allow connecting to my server from my external I.P?\nThanks.\n\nA: When your friends try and login your router doesn't know where to direct the traffic so it just sends back a no response. To fix this you need to forward the port number used by your Minecraft server to your computers internal ip address.\nOpen your router home page (can usually be accessed by entering 192.168.0.1 into your browsers address bar) then look for port forwarding. On the port forwarding page enter the port number used by your server into the start/end port boxes and your internal ip address into the ip address box.\nAs an example I would have to enter 25565 as the port and 192.168.0.5 as the ip address.\nIf you need to find your routers gateway address (to access the home page) enter the command ip route show and look for the default via which is your routers ip address. Alternatively the src address is your computers internal ip address if you needed to find that as well.\n\ndefault via 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0  proto static \n  192.168.0.0/24 dev wlan0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.5  metric 9\n\nI apologise for being a little bit vague as every router is different and the same approach may not work for all router models but in theory it should be very similar.\n", "Q: IP/PORT forward requests to another server I have the following listening PORT:IP set up on my UBuntu server.\n12.345.67.890:3636\n\nIt receives requests perfectly, however, I would now like to forward any requests to that IP:PORT to another IP:PORT, i.e.: \n09.876.54.321:3636\n\nEssentially I want to do a request forward 12.345.67.890:3636 -> 09.876.54.321:3636.\nHow can I go about it in Terminal and if I wanted to change it back how can I go about that too?

This question plus @Eric's answer have helped me solving something, thanks!  And I went further in researching this topic, so I want to share the knowledge with the community.\nPurging the rules\nIn order to clean up the routing rules,  you need to remove them from the NAT routing table (Network Addres Translation table).  You achieve this by that:\niptables -F -t nat\n\nOtherwise: if you miss out \"-t nat\" parameter, the rules mentioned in the question will continue working (e.g. in Ubuntu 18.04.2).\nSwitch off forwarding\nAdditionally, the kernel-parameter needs a separate command.  If you want to get all cleaned up you also have to:\nsysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0\n\nIt is generally strongly adviced not to enable forwarding of packets between interfaces in systems that are not routers, for security reasons.\nAppendix\n\n\n*\n\n*All actions typically need escalated priviledges, run them preceded with sudo or as \"root\".\n\n*Ad-acta.

It just means that ICMP is blocked somewhere.\nAs you say that you are able to resolve DNS names and surf the web, I don't see a problem in this.\nThere is just somewhere between you and the host(s) a firewall blocking your ping.\nAnd having the ICMP (pings) blocked, doesn't mean at all that you are limited into your Internet access (which is usually done on TCP port 80 and 443).\n", "Q: Config test failed when restarting Apache When I tried to restart apache2 i got the following error. \n* Restarting web server apache2                                         [fail] \n* The apache2 configtest failed.\nOutput of config test was:\nAH00526: Syntax error on line 14 of /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/httpd.conf:\nEither all Options must start with + or -, or no Option may.\nAction 'configtest' failed.\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n\nThe contents of httpd.conf is as follows.\n<Directory \"/var/www\">\n#\n# Possible values for the Options directive are \"None\", \"All\",\n# or any combination of:\n#   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews\n#\n# Note that \"MultiViews\" must be named *explicitly* --- \"Options All\"\n# doesn't give it to you.\n#\n# The Options directive is both complicated and important.

There's usually support for wired internet at the point you're at and is how I remedied this in the past. If you plug in an active ethernet cord and then search out Additional Drivers .. for me, using Xubuntu 12.04, it's in the Xubuntu Menu under settings but I believe in newer, Unity powered Ubuntu you can search out Software Sources and choose the \"Additional Drivers\" tab within that. The rest should be straight forward so long as you have some form of connectivity.\n[EDIT] Since starting to type this, I see a comment saying you literally have no input control, either. If this truly is a brand new install, although I hate saying this, you may want to run the install again, with the wired connection in (assuming you have access to one).\nAlso, you will probably have to download from AMD to get your graphics up and running at full potential.

I formatted my USB drive in Ubuntu's disk utility. When I plug that USB into my PC which has Windows XP on it, it shows the drive as corrupted.\nThat same USB works on Windows 7 and 8, just not with Windows XP. How can this be fixed?\n\nA: There are actually differences between NTFS used in different Windows versions, as described in this Wikipedia page.\nFor the most part, you can use NTFS volumes in a dual-boot system under XP and Windows 7, but there can be some issues with some of the more esoteric stuff. For example, XP can only deal with one System Restore point. If you mount a Windows 7 or Vista volume with multiple restore points, XP sees them as invalid and deletes all of them. Therefore you should avoid using an NTFS volume with XP if you are depending on restoring to a previous version.\nTo be more precise: Windows XP, Vista and 7 all use NTFS version 3.1. However, NTFS 3.1 is a highly complex and advanced file system, and in fact its design includes features that not all versions of Windows can support. So, there is no chance of Windows XP corrupting a Windows 7 volume (making all data impossible to access), however XP may destroy data that Windows 7 saved to disk, if said data is 7-specific.\n", "Q: OpenSSL not picking up CAs in certs folder by default On Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I am getting error for certificate validation error if the CApath is not explicitly set\nTried several solution.

After login in USER account, Go to terminal and type crontab -e Here you will get some text like below.\n# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.\n#\n# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line\n# indicating with different fields when the task will be run\n# and what command to run for the task\n#\n# To define the time you can provide concrete values for\n# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),\n# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#\n# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system\n# daemon's notion of time and timezones.\n#\n# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through\n# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).\n#\n# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts\n# at 5 a.m every week with:\n# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/\n#\n# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)\n#\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n\nNow I=in the end of file, you have to add */15 * * * * /ShellScript.sh line to run your script each after 15 min.

That's assuming your current working directory is a folder that contains only project folders.

When I open Nautilus, or when I look up /run/user/1000/gvfs it freezes for several seconds. This is also the case when I choose \"save as\" from a program, as the file save dialog includes shortcuts to the mounted shares.\nHave you also observed such behavior? Is there a way to debug it?\n\nA: Solving this problem has had mixed results. \nIf you try mounting DIRECTLY using CIFS, you'll see that it is about 3x faster. Compare CIFS to direct disc write.\nMany people have had this problem, as shown by a quick Google search.\nThings said to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some people have had success recompiling GVFS without HTTP.\n\n*Others have been able to solve this problem by dumping Nautilus and using the commandline.\n\n*Directly using IP addresses instead of NAS can sometimes work.\n\n*Adding DirectIO to the fstab.\n\n*Changing the CIFS buffer -- This is only temporary. To get this to be permanent, add options cifs CIFSMaxBufSize=65536 to /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf\n\n*Actually using CIFS instead of GVFS\n\nA: Troubleshooting tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try a different user:\n\n\n$ useradd testuser\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall program\n\n\n$ apt-get reinstall gvfs\n\n\n*\n\n*Check from a LiveCD of 14.04 (last resort)\n\n\nSorry man, this should go as a comment (but I don't have enough karma sigh).\n", "Q: No graphical interface at start-up I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 32bits.

Is there any specific command to rebuild ruby making it aware about the fact that openSSL is now installed?\n\nA: I've found the answer to my own question, and I think it would be more clear to post as an answer, rather than editing the question.\n1st try. Let's go through the path of non-safe source link.\nAs pointed out here, a possible choice to bypass the openSSL check is to remove the safe https link and add the non-safe one:\ngem source -r https://rubygems.org/\ngem source -a http://rubygems.org/\n\nThis way, the installation seems to go fine, but somewhere around the process openSSL is required again (for nokogiri gem, if I remember it well).\n2nd try. Rebuild Ruby (it was so easy).\nBy the time I asked this question, my brain was probably not working properly. After installing openSSL by the usual way:\nsudo apt-get install openssl\n\nI got to my ruby directory and typed the following lines:\npushd ext/openssl\nruby extconf.rb\nmake\nmake install\npopd\n\nThis way, I had all dependencies issues and stuff solved (I guess). Then, running\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\nI've rebuilt Ruby and finally the installation went fine.\n\nA: Rebuilding ruby after sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libreadline-dev libgdbm-dev can solve this issue.\nThe solution is found here: http://www.larshaendler.com/2015/05/20/unable-to-require-openssl-install-openssl-and-rebuild-ruby-on-ubuntu-14-lts/\n", "Q: ssh command related problem I am facing problem with the ssh command currently.

Let's say I wanted to use grunt to concatenate and minify js and css files prior of building the app. How to proceed?\nThank you.\n\nA: Since grunt comes from npm, and since npm gets grunt from online, you won't be able to use grunt in a Launchpad build. You can either copy grunt and all of its dependencies into your package (which is likely to make your package cumbersome), or use something else that does the equivalent functionality, like the libcss-minifier-perl and libjavascript-minifier-perl packages, which use Perl.\n", "Q: Mouseless Clipboard Manager There are a lot of clipboard managers available, but I search one which can be used without using the mouse.\nHas someone a recommendation for me?\n\nA: I use Diodon (available from the Software Centre).

I've installed virtualbox with following command:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nIs that normal behavior?\n\nA: The problem is that sudo virtualbox is used to launch VirtualBox, which would create the VMs in the root's home directory, and so this would require sudo to read any VMs. The errors here are just warnings from Qt and can be safely ignored.\n", "Q: How to launch a VM inside a VMWare player with a shell script? I am forced to use VMware Player instead of VirtualBox, so I wonder what is the answer for the same question  (similar to this one) as this but in the context of a VMWare player ?\n\nA: It is possible, although somewhat complicated as the documentation for performing this is a little obscure to me.\nFirst, you must ensure that the VMWare tools are installed and running on your guest machine.  In Linux, this does mean compiling them, and in Windows, they can be installed from the disk.\nSecondly, you must have the vmrun utility.

Is this possible?\n\nA: If the PCs are on the same network, it is possible.\nSoftware like Synergy can do it.\n\nSynergy brings your devices together in one cohesive experience.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Seamlessly move your mouse to any computer and start typing.\n  \n*Works on all major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux).\n  \n*Share your clipboard (copy and paste) between your computers. \n  \n\n\nA: (For most cases, synergy will be more useful than this - see @jonvon's answer.)\nThere is a more low-level solution similar to synergy - it's called x2x - like \"X to X\", joining two X screens together.\nWith two X displays, it can make the mouse switch to the other display when it touches the edge of the screen that is next to the other screen, which feels like it's just one mouse pointer on one big screen - while it actually moved to another computer, and switched over the keyboard control too.\nFor the task at hand, x2x shares the X selection between the two computers. When used with windows, it interacts with the clipboard.\nIt is available as the package x2x in Ubuntu, but there is also a Cygwin build, available from the cygwin setup. The cygwin version allows to connect to a Windows screen, without running X there.\nFor options, see man x2x.\n(Make sure you use one of the options like -west - that activates the more interesting mode of operation.)\n\nA: You can interact with the X clipboard (and the promary selection) using xclip.\nThe specific task in your question, paste text that was copied elsewhere, requires to copy over the clipboard contents.\nYou can use ssh to pipe the text from one clipboard to the other. That works best with password-less ssh login of course:\nAfter copying on on firstPc, you run on secondPc:\n$ ssh firstPc 'DISPLAY=:0 xclip -o -selection clipboard' | xclip -i  -selection clipboard\n\nNow, you can paste on secondPc.\nNote that a clipboard can not only contain text, but also more structured data. It can even contain the same data in multiple formats.\n\nA: You could also use this neat little online clipboard called IP-Share. I found it very useful when you want to copy/paste small text and/or files between computers or mobile devices within the same network!\n", "Q: I can't format my flash drive I'm trying to format my flash drive via Disks:\n\nbut every time I get this error: \n\nWhat should I do?

It also has a Micro SD card slot that contains a 16GB Micro SD card. So I have installed Ubuntu on the card and now is it possible to boot to that Micro SD card? If it's possible then how?\nP/S: I tried go to the BIOS menu and it didn't show the SD card sadly D:\n\nA: Use live Ubuntu and install gparted software and it will mount all the drives as well as microsd card and from there you can format your sd card and it will allocate as free space and then you will to boot another OS. \n\nA: If you can't find the SD Card as a boot option in your bios, it may be unlikely that you can boot to it.  The bios has an option to search for and specify which drive to boot to.  Most modern computers will include a USB slot (or pen drive) as a boot option.  You might consider getting a pen drive.  You can likely find one twice the size for around 10 dollars on a place like Amazon.\nWhen you installed Ubuntu on the card, the install would have automatically added it to your boot menu (along with your Windows 8) if you had access to choose it as your boot drive.\nChoosing which drive will contain the boot loader is one of features that happens as part of the installation.  So, I'm certain that part is already done.  It's just that your bios doesn't appear to support booting to the SD card.\nYou could alternatively install grub on your computer's hard drive instead.  Then grub would find all the OS installation and most likely succeed adding the SDCard as a OS Boot option.  But this could present a number of problems.  During it wrong might cause your Windows 8 not to boot.\nI'm sure your best bet would be to use a pen drive instead of the SD Card.\n", "Q: Is there a way to mirror directory changes in Terminator? I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 and am using Terminator as my primary terminal. I like it because it lets me keep a python interpreter and bash terminal open at the same time, in the same view.\nWhat is annoying is that I end up moving between directories A LOT, and then I have to do it twice. Is there a way to set up a terminator configuration to do that? To have terminator mirror directory changes. \nI'm guessing I'm not the only one that finds that frustrating!\n\nA: Ok. If I understand correctly, you basically have a Terminator window in a split view, where the one buffer is a Bash shell and the other is a Python interpreter. Now, whenever you type a command like cd Pictures/ in the Bash buffer, you want to automatically send the command os.chdir(\"Pictures/\") to the Python buffer, so that it changes directories simultaneously with your Bash shell. Kind of like in this image:\n\n...where the os.chdir command in the Python buffer should be entered automatically when you type a cd command in the Bash buffer. Right? If yes, here's a...\nSolution\nStep 1: Assign the two buffers to the same group\nTerminator supports groups of windows. We'll assign those two buffers to the same group, in order to later use Terminator's feature of broadcasting commands to windows in the same group. In this example I will assign both buffers to a group named Tau (actual name doesn't matter, but make sure it's the same for both buffers).\n\nStep 2: Define keyboard shortcuts to switch group broadcasting on and off\nBy default Terminator does not have keyboard shortcuts for these, but we need them now, so we'll define them via Terminator's Preferences menu. I used Ctrl+Insert to switch group broadcasting on, and Ctrl+Delete to switch it off. You can pick any other keyboard shortcuts you like, though you will have to adapt Step 3 appropriately.\n\nNow, you can press Ctrl+Insert, and whatever you type in the one buffer will appear in the other buffer. By typing Ctrl+Delete you deactivate that behavior again.\nIf the Python interpreter understood a command such as cd Pictures/, to change a directory in both buffers, all you would have to do now would be something like Ctrl+Insertcd Pictures/Ctrl+Delete, to broadcast the command as is. But the normal Python interpreter does not understand this cd command. You could use IPython, which does understand it, instead of the pure Python interpreter. However I assume that (1) you want the pure Python interpreter and (2) you don't want having to remember pressing these key combinations before and after each cd command. So, let's head to Step 3.\nStep 3: Translate and send the cd command automatically to the Python buffer\nWe will re-alias Bash's builtin cd command to do a little more before actually changing the working directory in the current shell. Namely, whenever a user types cd somewhere,\n\n\n*\n\n*We translate the command to Python\n\n*We use xdotool to simulate pressing Ctrl+Insert\n\n*We use xdotool to simulate typing the translated command\n\n*We use xdotool to simulate pressing Return\n\n*We use xdotool to simulate pressing Ctrl+Delete\nIn this way, the translated command will be sent to the Python buffer. If you don't have it, install xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool \n\nThe script that we want as an alias for cd will look something like this:\nfunction cd_to_pybuf {\n  xdotool type \"#\"\n  xdotool key Ctrl+Insert\n  xdotool type \"os.chdir(\\\"$1\\\")\"\n  xdotool key Return\n  xdotool key Ctrl+Delete\n  cd \"$1\"\n}\ncd_to_pybuf\n\nExplanation: When we alias cd to the above script, then whenever we type cd somewhere, Bash translates that to OURSCRIPT somewhere. Since our script ends with the function call cd_to_pybuf, it will actually call the function cd_to_pybuf with somewhere as argument (available as $1 within the function; note that bash expansion would not work here, so we can't use something like !* to get at the arguments of the original command, and $BASH_COMMAND is problematic too). This function performs exactly the steps enumerated above. On a sidenote, we also simulate typing # before we simulate pressing Ctrl+Insert, because whatever we type after that will appear in both buffers, and Bash does not understand the os.chdir command, so with that # sign we make it into a comment for Bash. After the xdotool stuff, we also perform the actual cd command in the Bash buffer.\nSo now, we re-alias cd to that script, and test it:\n\nIt works! That os.chdir(\"..\") command in the Python buffer was typed automatically. I didn't do it. All I did was type cd .. in the Bash buffer. You can see that the command #os.chdir(\"..\") was also automatically typed into the Bash buffer, but since it's a comment it had no real effect.\nTo make this change permanent, put that alias into ~/.bashrc, i.e., in your ~/.bashrc add the line:\nalias cd='function cd_to_pybuf { xdotool type \"#\"; xdotool key Ctrl+Insert; xdotool type \"os.chdir(\\\"$1\\\")\"; xdotool key Return; xdotool key Ctrl+Delete; cd \"$1\"; }; cd_to_pybuf'\n\nAnd voilà! That was it.\nBonus: an alias for pwd\nSometimes you may want to check what the current working directory is in both buffers at once. We can use the very same technique as for cd, and re-alias pwd. The following command will do the trick, and you can also put it into your ~/.bashrc if you like:\nalias pwd='function pwd_to_pybuf { xdotool type \"#\"; xdotool key Ctrl+Insert; xdotool type \"os.getcwd()\"; xdotool key Return; xdotool key Ctrl+Delete; pwd; }; pwd_to_pybuf'\n\nWhat you will have to remember\nFor this to work in the future, whenever you open up a split view with a Bash and a Python buffer, you will have to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assign both buffers to the same group in Terminator\n\n*import os in your Python buffer\n\n\nThat's all.\nTroubleshooting\nThis is not perfect. There are some minor problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a little ugly that this #os.chdir thingy gets printed to the Bash buffer also. It's really cosmetic, but you might consider doing something different, e.g., after you simulated typing the command and before simulating pressing Return, deactivate broadcasting temporarily and remove that command (e.g., simulate a lot of backspaces, or the sequence Ctrl+A, Ctrl+K) from the Bash buffer or whatever.\n\n*Some special arguments to cd will not work. Things like cd - (change to $OLDPWD), cd ~ (change to $HOME), or cd (without arguments, also change to $HOME). Here also, the script could be improved to account for such special cases (check if $1 is special, and translate appropriately). Such things should be a piece of cake from here, though.\n\n*Optional parameters to cd, such as, e.g., cd -P somewhere, will not work because the translation would be os.chdir(\"-P\") here. You could use $@ instead of $1 to look at all arguments, and then do the appropriate thing.\nHope I could help :) It was an interesting challenge!\n", "Q: Audio controls in Xfce 4.8 I am seeing several questions similar to mine, but none of the answers are sufficient.

Is this a limitation in 14.04? (I am somewhat ignorant to the distinction between Gnome and Unity) Can I do anything to properly set my DPI?\n\nA: The option \"Scale for menu and title bars\" should suffice, it's kind of badly named, it scales everything and not only menu and title bars.

The first snag which I haven't yet gotten over was getting a wireless internet connection for the server. During the install, it asked for details of my wireless router. On the first install I had the router setup to only accept known MAC addresses, and also to not broadcast itself. After typing in the correct details for the network, it wouldn't add it. So I went back and connected to the router directly with an ethernet cable which didn't work at first, but after configuring the router to not filter MAC addresses, it appeared to work fine.\nI tried to use the explanation found here to fix the wireless issue via the command line:\nHow to connect and disconnect to a network manually in terminal?\nUnfortunately, none of the wpa_supplicant methods worked, and when I tried the network manager part, my computer said that it couldn't find the create_connections folder. However this currently isn't the issue I am writing about now, (I may have to start a new thread at some point!) I instead installed a Lubuntu GUI on the server to see if I could access a network manager from there, and access wireless via that. After downloading it and starting it, the internet still worked with an ethernet cable. However, there was no icon showing network manager, although there is a space  So I did some more looking and found that you have to goto preferences > lx.... and type nm-applet in the autostart tab. After doing this, and relogging in, no icon appeared, but the blank space increased. I double clicked on the blank space and network manager appeared, and two NM icons appeared. I used one of them to connect to my wireless router and thought all would be well! (Both NM icons showed connection to my wireless network.) After opening Firefox, when trying to access the BBC website the circle kept on turning. At this point I turned off the eth0 port in case that was interfering, and it still didn't work. I went into the command line and typed \"ping -c 5 www.bbc.co.uk\" and after a while it said that it couldn't connect to the server. I pinged the router address which was fine. I then turned on the eth0 port and I still didn't have access to the internet! So I went back into preferences > LX... and took of the nm-applet. After re-logging into the account I could then access the internet via ethernet cable. However the network manager icons had dissapeared, and when I clicked on the blank space, although options appeared, they were greyed out. I tried the NM-applet solution again and the icons appeared but when clicking on them the options are still greyed out.\nI have spent the majority of the last two days trying to solve this and getting nowhere. Can anyone suggest anything to help?\n\nA: \nThe ip address in the address line must be the reserved ip address you\n  have configured within your router.\n\nThat works well, but the more common method is to pick an address outside the DHCP range in the router. For example, if the router is set to allow 50 addresses for DHCP from, for example, 192,168.1.2 to 192.168.1.51, pick an address outside the range, such as 192.168.1.100. Keep a journal of the various addresses assigned statically, or do as I did years ago; write '100' on the back of the machine with a marker. Crude but effective. \n\nA: Ubuntu server for me works now.\nThe process I followed was thus: (NB these steps are for a simple home network, and assumes a little knowledge about getting local network settings such as the gateway address, and the DNS name server address.)\n1) I set-up a reserved ip-address within my router for my home network. (See NB1 at the end of this post about obtaining the wireless MAC address of your device. This will probably be needed for reserving an ip address) This part for me was pretty important as when first installing Ubuntu server, my device could not acccess the router wirelessly until this address was configured on the router. Don't forget the ip address you have reserved, as it will be needed later!!! \n2) After Ubuntu server boots, I went into the \"interfaces\" file within the system to edit it. NB see the note at the end about text editors!! \n3) I pressed return a couple of times after the last entry, and typed in the following lines within the interfaces file to get the wireless network to work:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.120  <-- The reserved ip address as configured on your router\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1\nwpa-ssid myroutername\nwpa-psk mysecretkey\nThe first two lines must be typed as they are. The ip address in the address line must be the reserved ip address you have configured within your router. The netmask line should be typed as it is, (assuming this is a home network, with a simple 255.255.255.0 network.) The gateway address and dns-nameserver are normally the same thing on a home router, and can be found when accessing the home router, or by typing ipconfig on any windows machine at the command line, or can be checked in your network configuration on a tablet or fablet or smartphone!\nmyroutername in the WPA line is the actual name of your router as recognised on the network, (eg SKY76543, BTHub-98054, etc)\nmysecretkey is the router password to be able to connect to the router. NB these lines are if your router has WPA/WPA2 configured. If you don't have it configured, or have WEP, please consider updating to WPA! (And dont type these lines!)\nAfter typing the above into the interfaces file, save it, then reboot your server, and you should have wireless access!!!\nNB 1 \nFor other people reading this you may need the MAC address of the wireless card that your device is using - typing ifconfig at the command line will bring up your network interfaces and the associated MAC addresses, which are always of the form aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa where the a's will actually be either a number from 0-9, or letters a-f. The MAC address that you will need for the router is the one associated with the wlan0 adapter. As an extra note bene, this might not work if the wireless adapter hasn't been \"turned on.\" Typing iwconfig wlan0 up at the command line, (as a root user) will bring it up. If you get a response mentioning something about rfkill, try typing in \"sudo rfkill unblock wifi\" at the command line, then type in the previous iwconfig command, (remember as a root user!) Then finally type ifconfig and the wlan0 should appear!\nNB 2 \nI used the command, \"gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces.\" which opens the interfaces file found in the /etc/network folder, and opens it using the gedit text editor; The gksudo command actually allows you to edit the file, as opposed to just viewing it. gedit is a text editor within Ubuntu that allows you to edit any type of file within Ubunutu. At this point I had the lubuntu desktop installed on my ubuntu server, AND the gedit program installed. gedit needs a gui front end to work. If you have a fresh ubuntu server with only a command line to work from, the vi text editor (which should come with your installation) also allows you to edit the interfaces file. Use the command \"vi /etc/network/interfaces.\" to open it in vi. Vi is a bit more complicated to use than gedit, so read up on how to edit files from vi, and then save them from vi.\nNB All of the above are thanks to askubuntu and mainly chili555 for the configuration in the interfaces file.\n", "Q: How to uninstall Haguichi/Hamachi completely? I want to completely uninstall Haguichi and Hamachi from my computer.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: Uninstalling Haguichi (a graphical frontend for Hamachi)\nAssuming you installed Haguchi through the Webupd8 Haguchi PPA as recommended on the Haguchi download page, you can uninstall the haguichi and haguichi-appindicator packages and remove the PPA from your software sources.\nI suggest using the ppa-purge utility to accomplish this. If you don't have it, install the ppa-purge  package first:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nThen use it to remove the Haguchi PPA:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:webupd8team/haguichi\n\nUninstalling Hamachi\nAssuming you installed Hamachi with one of the .deb files provided at the Hamachi for Linux download page, just remove the logmein-hamachi package:\nsudo apt-get remove logmein-hamachi\n\nThat stops the Hamachi service and uninstalls Hamachi. If you want to also remove systemwide configuration files, you can use sudo apt-get purge logmein-hamachi instead.\nRemoving lsb-core\nOptionally, you may wish to remove the lsb-core package (and any of its dependencies that are not required by other software you've installed). On Ubuntu this package is not very commonly installed, but logmein-hamachi depends on it, so you probably installed it when you installed Hamachi originally.\nJust in case something else is depending on lsb-core, I recommend marking it as automatically installed and then performing autoremoval of unneeded packages, rather than forcing it to be removed:\nsudo apt-mark auto lsb-core\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nIf you want to also remove systemwide configuration files, you can use sudo apt-get --purge autoremove instead of sudo apt-get --autoremove.\n", "Q: Cannot Get usb to boot in windows 8 I have created the USB stick with Pen drive linux USB installer, and have disabled secure boot and selected the stick to be the bootable source, but it still goes to Windows 8 instead of USB installed with Ubuntu. I am having the hardest time with this, please help! \n\nA: I think this is more of a forum question, because I think it'll take some back and forth.  Often, issues with booting to USB are related to BIOS settings.  It could be that you just need to rearrange to boot order.  Sometimes, even though USB is available as an option, the machine just won't (these same machines sometimes won't boot to CD, either).  The only way I've been able to reliably boot to USB is if I created the boot drive with UNetBootin, and have set the boot order properly.  Sometimes a cheating way to tell if the machine will recognize it is to shut down windows with the usb active ... sometimes windows will give you an error to let you know you still have a \"disk\" in the \"drive.\"  Depending on how it's booting, you may also want to check the bootloader (ie: grub) to see if the timer is set to zero with the other operating system as default.\n", "Q: Upgrade from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS fails Output of the Bash Terminal: http://pastebin.com/wXKtLzin\nI used apt-get upgrade -f as well, with the same result.\nI only want the 14.04 LTS that works fine and I don't lose my data.

My Computer is set up as Dualboot Windows and Ubuntu. I have 1 OS drive, and 1 hard drive with a /backup partition (which has all my family photos and data) and it is ext4. Also note... it is EXT4, and it is GPT, and it is 4TB size.\nAnyway, Windows can not mount the /backup ext4 partition. What software/freeware do you reccomend for Windows? Preferrably looking for someone with experiance using it for a long time and not have problems with EXT4 partition which is a 4TB, GPT Disk.\n\nA: Got it! The Paragon EXT Driver works perfectly (and copies files INTO ext4 which root:root permissions, so ext 4 is safely receiving those files).\nJust in case anyone was wondering: In /etc/fstab for the /data ntfs partition I was using \"0 0\" as the mount permissions at the end. This caused Ubuntu to save files with invalid ntfs permissions into the /backupdata. Ubuntu can still read/write those files no problem, but when you boot into windows and do a chkdsk to check your files, it will delete those inodes and you will see checkdsk saying \"invalid permissions on file abc.. found\" as it scrolls. You should use \"0 2\" and the \"ntfs-3g\" in fstab to fix this. But I hate ntfs now because windows randomly does a checkdsk and deletes stuff, so I just leave my /backupdata as ext4 and this is better. Then the PARAGON driver below works to mount the ext4 but checkdsk will never run. Instead if you need it, ubuntu or fedora or any linux uses 'fsck -y /dev/sdb1' to fix if you need to fix files. :)\nHere is the driver if anyone needs it:\n\nExt for Windows | PARAGON Software Group - Ext2 / Ext3 ...\n  www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-windows/ Paragon Software Group\n  Paragon ExtFS for Windows is a special utility which allows you to get\n  full access to Ext2 / Ext3 / Ext4 in Windows.

Upgrade failing with \"dpkg-divert: error: rename involves overwriting - with different file - not allowed I asked for assistance about a month ago, but haven't received a single response.  If I asked incorrectly or broke etiquette rules I am truly sorry.  \nMy original question was this:\n\nI ran 12.04 LTS forever without a hitch.  Realized I was falling behind, so I took the plunge.\nFirst problem was that I had to take a phased approach; couldn't upgrade directly to 14.  But packages for 13.x were no longer available on US servers (I'm in San Diego).  I selected \"Best Server\", and it took me to Singapore.  All good.\nFirst upgrade I did over SSH, from my LAN.  Went from 12.04 to 13.04.  It took a few hours, but went without a hitch.  Everything tested good.\nNext upgrade (13.04 to 13.10) I did over SSH, from work.  Again took a few hours, but everything went smoothly.\nWhen I got home I decided to go for the gold, and kicked off the final upgrade (from 13.10 to 14.04) from the local machine.  First I changed the source from Singapore back to the US.  Then I started the upgrade.  It went well, but eventually started returning errors.  First was a minor error, which said the install would continue.  After two or three I received a message that the install failed and would be halted.  But it continued.  I noticed that the video kept turning off and on.  I allowed it to continue to completion, after a few more errors.\nThe end state is that the host machine appears to lock as soon as it boots.  However I am able to SSH into the machine, and it appears to be functioning properly.  I believe the problem is with X-Windows.

From the source folder, I am running ./configure --with-python\nWhen I did tab-complete from --with- I did not see Python in the list. \nBut when I ran configure with that flag, it did not baulk. \nWhen I run make, it complains that Python is not found.\nchecking for python2.7... no\n\nbut Python is installed:\n $ which python\npython                python2.7             python2.7-dbg-config\npython2               python2.7-dbg \n\n$ which python2.7 \n/usr/bin/python2.7\n\nI compiled GDB without --with-python\nand things installed without error.

Or should I not call \"pi\"?\n\nA: With benefit of Peter Schaeffer's excellent answer, I was able to build & install GDB 8.3.1 with Python 3.6, from source.  The critical insight was that the LDFLAGS and LIBS which ./configure accepts are different from the LDFLAGS and LIBS which make requires.  Yes they should be same, but in this case they were not.\n\nPre-requisite Steps\n\n*\n\n*install python3 package\n\n\n*install python3-devel package\n\n\n*install texinfo package\n\n\n*run /usr/bin/python3.6-config --includes; that printed (twice!)\n-I/usr/include/python3.6m\n\n\n\n*run /usr/bin/python3.6-config --ldflags; that printed\n-L/usr/lib64 -lpython3.6m -lpthread -ldl -lutil -lm -Xlinker -export-dynamic\n\n\n\n*run /usr/bin/python3.6-config --libs; that printed\n-lpython3.6m -lpthread -ldl -lutil -lm \n\n\n\n*find the real path of \"python3\" binary, by running readlink --canonicalize-existing $(which python3); that printed\n/usr/bin/python3.6\n\n\nBuild Steps\nexport CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/include/python3.6m\"\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/lib64\"\nexport LIBS=\"-lpython3\"\n\nreadonly configureOptions=\"\\\n--disable-ada \\\n--disable-cloog-version-check \\\n--disable-gdbmi \\\n--disable-host-shared \\\n--disable-isl-version-check \\\n--disable-libssp \\\n--disable-libquadmath \\\n--disable-libquadmath-support \\\n--disable-objc-gc \\\n--disable-source-highlight \\\n--disable-stage1-checking \\\n--disable-static-libjava \\\n--disable-tui \\\n--disable-werror \\\n--enable-stage1-languages=c,c++ \\\n--enable-vtable-verify \\\n--with-python=/usr/bin/python3.6 \\\n--with-static-standard-libraries \\\n--with-system-zlib \\\n--without-cloog \\\n--without-guile \\\n--without-isl \\\n--without-mpfr \\\n\"\n./configure $configureOptions\n\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/lib64 -lpthread -ldl -lutil -lm -Xlinker -export-dynamic\"\nexport LIBS=\"-lpython3.6m -lpthread -ldl -lutil -lm\"\n\nmake\n\nmake install\n\n\nA: I spent quite a bit of time working on getting gdb (7.9) to work with Python (2.7). In the end everything worked rather well. However, there are a bunch of things that you have to get right. The key point is that the gdb configure script tries to compile a small C program that looks like this.\n#include \"Python.h\"\nint\nmain ()\n{\nPy_Initialize ();\n  ;\n  return 0;\n}\n\nIf this program won't compile, then Python support won't be built. For this program to compile, the Python.h include file must be found in /usr/include/python2.7. This file will only exist if the python-devel package is installed. On my system (redhat), the command for installing this package is sudo yum install python-devel.\nHowever, that's not enough to get Python installed. Before the configure script tries to compile the C program, it gets various options from python-config.py. If these options aren't correct, then the C program won't compile. On my system, python-config.py returned the options below.\n-lpthread -ldl -lutil -lm -lpython2.7 -Xlinker -export-dynamic\n\nThese options didn't cause any problems in my environment. Other folks have had problems with the options returned from python-config.py and have made changes to python-config.py to resolve these problems. On my system the complete compile command was\ngcc -o conftest -g -O2   -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I/usr/include/python2.7 \\\n    conftest.c -ldl -lncurses -lz -lm -ldl    -lpthread -ldl -lutil -lm \\\n    -lpython2.7 -Xlinker -export-dynamic\n\nThis compile command completed without any errors as soon as I installed python-devel. Note you don't have to manually enter the gcc command. I did run the gcc command several times to make sure everything was correct. Normally, the configure script will run the\ncompiler for you. Also note that to get the overall gdb install process to complete, makeinfo also had to be installed. The command for installing makeinfo was sudo yum install texinfo.\nOverall, the correct set of steps seems to be\n\n*\n\n*Install python-devel\n\n\n*Install texinfo\n\n\n*Download the gdb source and gunzip it and untar it.\n\n\n*cd to the gdb-7.9 directory with the configure file.\n\n\n*\n./configure --prefix=/usr --with-python\nmake \nsudo make install\n\nIt should be possible to get gdb to work with Python 3. The various gdb scripts and install programs mention Python 3 in many, many places. However, the correct procedure for installing gdb with Python 3 is unknown to me at this point.\n", "Q: Cannot Write to www and update wordpress at same time I have LAMP installed on my Ubuntu 14.04 server and am using apache as a web server.  I am going to be using the web server for Wordpress primarily.  The problem I am running into is that I cannot update Wordpress or add plugins the standard way.  It keeps asking me for my FTP credentials.  \nI did some Googling and was able to fix the Wordpress update problem by changing ownership of the www folder to www-data:www-data.  The problem with doing this, though, is I no longer am able to edit the shared files through Samba. When I change ownership to user:www-data I can modify the files but cannot update Wordpress without it asking for FTP. The folder is chmod 755 and I DO NOT want to go to 777. \nSo... can anyone help point me in the right direction to correct this?

You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to either install Ubuntu or try it from the USB.\nIf your computer does not automatically do this, you might need to change the device from which the computer starts up to the USB. You can usually do this by watching for a message appearing before Windows starts. You should be invited to change the boot device. Once you’ve selected that option, follow the instructions on screen.\nTip: You might be able to press ‘F12’ or ‘Escape’ while your computer is starting up to change your boot device order.\nDepending on your computer and how your USB key was formatted, you should see an entry for ‘removable drive’ or ‘USB media’. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to start from USB rather than the hard disk. Save your changes and continue.\n\nIf you select \"Try\" you can work in Live environment and it neither installs Ubuntu nor affects Windows previously installed (if any).\nThen shutdown normally the OS which turns the PC off, remove the flash drive and when you boot it again it will work with your Windows like nothing happened.\n\nA: First of all you need to tell your computer to boot from livecd/USB. By default PC boots from HDD, if not just plug off the disk with Ubuntu and you will return to your doors, oh sorry windows.\n\nA: If you don't like it, just reboot (remove the USB!).  The 'Try Ubuntu' option loads the OS from the USB, and allows you to manipulate Ubuntu in a live environment, but does not write to your hard disk.\n", "Q: Can we have both 32 bit & 64 bit architecture on a single machine Most softwares support 32 bit architecture. Some high end software need 64 bit architecture. Can we have both architecture on a single distro ?\n\nA: Yes.  Ubuntu has what it calls multi-arch support in it's 64 bit versions.\nAll it means is that the 32 bit and 64 bit libraries exist on the same system in different directories.  The software knows how to locate and load the correct version.\nBy default, the 32 bit libraries may not be installed but you're able to do so using apt.\n\"Some high end software?\"  Do you release that most software is 64 bit now.  The 64 bit architecture has been around for quite some time now and is not limited to what you might be calling \"high end software\".  Even bash is 64 bit.\n", "Q: dpkg lists uninstalled kernels I have run the following command to remove old kernels:\ndpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d' | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\nand only the current kernel is now installed, which I have confirmed in synaptic and by checking my boot partition.

I've got trac installed and OpenSSH. Intermittently both become unavailable, as if the server has gone to sleep, which seems odd because to me, the whole idea of a server is that it's always on/available.\nThe server is only used on the LAN.\nI've tried adding acpi=off to /etc/default/grub, running update and rebooting, no difference.\nCurrently, I have SSH open and if I leave it for some time, it will remain connected, but lag horribly when I go back to using it.\nLast time this sleep/hibernate issue happened, I had to plug in a keyboard and monitor to get it come back up.\nAny ideas or suggestions?\n\nA: I understand this is an old post, but I had this same problem and had a hard time finding a decent answer. \nMy laptop with Ubuntu Server would go into a white screen saver, and soon after everything would lose connection to the server. As soon as I exited the screen saver with the keyboard on the laptop, everything was able to once again connect. The acpi=off, setterm -blank 0, and other options described on similar questions never worked, until I found a working answer from the Unix and Linux SE.\nAfter this solution, my laptop still goes to the white screen saver, however I no longer lose connection to any of the services running on it (SSH, SFTP, HTTP).\nThis command disables suspend:\nsudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target\n\nand this command brings it back:\nsudo systemctl unmask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target\n\n\nA: Try using\nsetterm -blank 0\n\nIt needs to be entered after every boot, but keeps things running.\n\nA: You might try Caffeine. You can either use the 'caffeinate' command to prevent your server from sleeping during a given commmand (see http://www.webupd8.org/2015/01/caffeine-app-gets-its-indicator-back.html for syntax) or just set it to prevent idle all the time. \n\nA: I found that I wanted a way that was a bit more knowledgeable about which sessions I wanted to keep awake. Luckily systemd has a facility for inhibiting sleep/hibernate, etc. with Inhibitor Locks and the tool systemd-inhibit.\nThe following will inhibit sleep:\nsudo systemd-inhibit --mode=block --what=sleep tail --pid=$$ -f /dev/null\n\nHere's a slightly more robust command that adds a bit of logging and sets some values to improve debugging when using systemd-inhibit --list it also inhibits sleeping when a laptop lid is cosed:\n/usr/bin/systemd-inhibit \\\n  --mode=block --who=\"$0\" \\\n  --what=sleep:handle-lid-switch --why=\"Requested by $USER\" \\\n  /usr/bin/tail --pid=$$ -f /dev/null\n\nRun that and put it into the background and the current shell will define the life of the sleep inhibitor.\n\nA: setterm -blank 0 added to the GRUB boot command typically is ignored by the kernel and I find myself having to use the arrow-up function\nto type it again quickly over and over. It seems to work after \nentering the command 15 or 20 times from a root terminal. I enter it as quickly as I can strike the 2 keys necessary (i.e., up arrow followed by the Enter key) and I usually can get a terminal to remain open. \nBe advised that closing a terminal artificially held open via the setterm -blank 0 command` seems to be interpreted by the kernel as a totally erroneous \"indication\" that is has permissions to go independently into sleep/hibernation mode. I recommend that you start a root terminal in, say, tty2 or tty3, and leave it running.  As long as the terminal program remains active, on my system at least, it does appear that I may be permitted to keep my console monitor up and running.\nsetterm -blank 0 does not address the problem of who gave the system permissions to go independently into sleep/hibernation mode and how I can get control of my system back. It's important to me that my file server should be on-line and available at all times. To keep my serer running, I am personally rewriting some kernel modules. After I get those mods in place I will permanently disable software updates and my problem will be solved, at least until I purchase some newer hardware that requires a newer kernel, and then, in order to keep my server running, I will be forced to rewrite parts of the kernel again.\n", "Q: How to configure a network printer in Ubuntu 14.04 I have 2 printers on a home WiFi network that are accessed by 2 desktops running Windows.\nI have a new laptop on which I am learning/trying Ubuntu 14.04.

I don't know what filesystem Android uses. I guess it may be an ext? (Turns out the sdcard is vfat) In any case add the -t filesytemtype flag immediately after mount. As in sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdc1 /media/mysdcard -o force\nHave a look at this article https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB\nIf it works grab all the data you can off the card. \n\nA: So as discussed in the comments of the question itself newer android devices use the Media Tranfer Protocol or MTP for short. Using testdisk to restore a MTP sdcard will not work since testdisk (as far as I know) does not support MTP.\nInstead you should use a tool that can restore MTP sdcards.\nCWM (ClockWorkMod) Recovery is such a tool. Doing a formatting using this tool is a method to fix your sdcard.\nYou'll need to do is install it onto your phone. Next up is booting into CWM recovery and selecting \"mounts and storage\" -> \"format sdcard\".\nLet it run and you're done.\n\n\n", "Q: Software icon (from Sublime Text) isn't displayed in launcher I can start the software and find it over the dash, but no icon is shown (a blank sheet in the dash and a question mark in launcher).\nSublime Text is sitting in /opt/sublime_text/ . sudo sublime /usr/share/applications/sublime.desktop looks as following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=3.0\nName=Sublime Text 3\n# Only KDE 4 seems to use GenericName, so we reuse the KDE strings.\n# From Ubuntu's language-pack-kde-XX-base packages, version 9.04-20090413.\nGenericName=Text Editor\n\nExec=sublime\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/opt/sublime_text/Icon/48x48/sublime_text.png\nType=Application\nCategories=TextEditor;IDE;Development\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=NewWindow\n\n[NewWindow Shortcut Group]\nName=New Window\nExec=sublime -n\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nI got also a \"?\" on icons from applications unity wants me to install from firefox (like tumblr, gmail).\n\nA: For me it helped to simply change a line in /.local/share/applications/sublime_text.desktop\nWrong: Icon=sublime_text.png\nCorrect: Icon=sublime-text.png\ni.e. replace underscore by dash in icon name.\n\nA: Had exact problem, adding the correct path to executable or softline resolved the issue for me\nExec=/usr/bin/sublime %F\nDon't forget to quit and restart sublime for this to get updated.\n\nA: The only thing that I feel would be wrong is the path.Add a proper path to Exec. \n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Sublime Text\nGenericName=Text Editor\nComment=Sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose\nExec=/opt/sublime_text/sublime_text %F\nTerminal=false\nMimeType=text/plain;\nIcon=sublime-text\nCategories=TextEditor;Development;\nStartupNotify=true\nActions=Window;Document;\n\nHopefully this should resolve the issue.\n", "Q: Not able to clean out old kernel files in /boot I am trying to Update my server\nnavin@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nReading package lists...

I have a configured and working service script myservice in the /etc/init.d and in /etc/rc*.d directories of an Ubuntu 13.10 distribution. \nRemoving the links in /etc/rc*.d using update-rc.d -f myservice remove doesnt'remove the service after a reboot. What am I missing here and how should I properly add/remove services on this Ubuntu distribution ?\n\nA: According to update-rc.d manual:\n\nWhen  invoked  with the remove option, update-rc.d removes any links\n  in  the /etc/rcrunlevel.d directories to the script /etc/init.d/name. \n  The  script  must have been deleted already.

And could you provide a link of the source?\n\nA: *\n\n*Cinerella is free software. You can try it for free and if you don't like it, it costs you nothing.\n\n*Cinerella is maintained by updates. A new version of Cinerella for Ubuntu for 2014 is coming soon. If you buy Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, within a few years the latest version of Cinerella will be better than the version of Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 that you bought. \n\n*Cinelerra-CV (the community version) packages for Ubuntu are available from the \"Cinelerra-CV\" team PPA. Instructions for adding this PPA to your system can be found at the same link.\nSource: Cinerella official website\n\nA: My experience of Cinelerra is that it's an old fashioned clunky NLE from a previous age which is somewhat buggy.  That said, it has some advanced features, and does seem to have kept up with the plethora of newer HD video formats.  It's a little hard to get working the way you want.  If you do use it, you'll want to use the \"community version\".\nYou should give serious consideration also to Blender which apart from its use in 3D modelling has also a rather capable non-linear video editor as well (VSE).\n", "Q: Intranet LAN networking for office PCS I am a Newbie in Ubuntu.\nI have 8 new PCs installed with Ubuntu 14.04, I am unable to do networking in them.

I am suffering from occasional desktop freezes and am still investigating the cause. (Links forthcoming.) In the meantime I came across the following suggestion to cpulimit the unity-panel-service, which is working great so far!\nsudo cpulimit -eb unity-panel-service -l 30\n\nI would now like to configure cpulimit so that it:\n\n\n*\n\n*starts as soon as I log in\n\n*runs in the background (no terminal required)\n\n*if unity-panel-service restarts, it should discover and limit the new process\n\n\nIs this possible?\nNote: I am aware that this is a workaround to a desktop bug. My question is primarily about using cpulimit, rather than the bug/workaround. When I have a moment I will provide links relating to the bug itself so discussion on that front can happen elsewhere.\n\nA: How to run a command at login?:\n\nAdding the command to the end of ~/.profile should do the trick (where ~ represents your home directory). \n..you can start a script from a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart/\n\nOPTIONS\n      -b  --background   run in background\nsudo cpulimit -l 30 -b -p $(pgrep -o \"unity-panel-service\")\n\nIf you put a single & at the end of the command on a cli, it's supposed to run the job in the background. And it should find the new pid from the name every time. You can check if its running by:\npgrep -o \"cpulimit\"\n\nOr create a bash script from it and make the script executable and set it to auto-run using autostart in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Should I do a regular system update before a upgrading to the next distro? Should I perform distribution upgrade only on a fully up to date system, or should it run fine if I do the distribution upgrade right away? \nMore details:\nBefore I perform an upgrade to the next version. I perform it first in a virtual machine to see it will be fine, and won't mess up anything. \nWhen I booted my virtual machine it immediately popped up a window whether I want to upgrade it to 14.04. I clicked yes. It initially went fine then started to spew error popups about dependency problems.\nThe VM haven't booted up since the last upgrade to 12.04, 2 years. I suspect this caused the problem but not sure.\nI worry I'd mess up the host if I get the same errors during upgrade.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu's own site states that you should perform a regular update before upgrading your distro.\nFurthermore, from personal experience, if you don't update beforehand the distro upgrade with have to perform the updates anyway. Part of upgrading distros is updating mass amounts of packages.\n", "Q: How to avoid the automatic disk check every 30 reboots? It it has to do a disc check from being powered down 30 times like that.I have to do it that way cause it wont power down regularly and I'm running Linux ultimate edition x64 2.3. I know its out dated but I can upgrade. PLEASE HELP! I've tried everything and I'm completely clueless.\n\nA: The standard Linux filesystem is checked for consistency, on mount,  every 30 mount and every month, whatever come first. It is possible to shut off this behavior (not recommended) by issuing (1): \nsudo tune2fs -c 0 -i 0 your_device_here \n\nHowever, filesystems are checked on mount every time the disk not correctly unmounted (say, a forced poweroff, or unplugging an external device); this behavior is not avoidable. \nYour case seems (after deciphring yur question) more the second one, so in this case your only possibility is to solve the clean shutdown problem.\n\nNote (1), TL;DR version: more in detail, you have to find the device on which your filesystem resides; you can see this by starting a Terminal Emulator (typically from the dash Alt-Ctrl-T, but it depends on your flavor of Linux) issuing \nmount \n\nin the terminal. For example, on my PC you have: \n[romano:~] % mount\n/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\n/dev/sda5 on /home type ext4 (rw)\n...\n\nso for example the device where my root filesystem lives is /dev/sda1, and my /home is on  /dev/sda5. If you got confused about the Unix way of devices, filesystem and mount point please read this nice tutorial. \nSo if you want to remove the safety belts for /, in my system I should do: \n sudo tune2fs -c 0 -i 0 /dev/sda1\n\n...but be warned that now you are running with no safety belts; do not protest when your drive will crash and you lose data. Backup frequently.  \n", "Q: any support in any Ubuntu flavor for per-display DPI scaling? my question is about having multiple monitors with different density (DPI) to display the UI at approximately the same physical dimensions.\nThe feature is supported by Windows 8.1 and Mac OS 10.9. For an illustration of it please see this M$ blog (the calculator example): Optimizing Multi-Mon DPI Scaling in Windows 8.1\nI use KDE (Kubuntu 14.04). My displays are:\n\n\n*\n\n*15.4in FullHD laptop (144dpi)\n\n*23in FullHD laptop (96dp)\n\n\nEverything looks too small on the laptop and too large on display. It's so funny because I use the laptop on the couch when I need to casually browse (need larger scale to see things easier) and I use the desk monitor when I need to work (need smaller scale to fit more stuff).\nWhile this is not a problem on Windows and Mac (because of per-display scaling):\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac scaling looks good on the retina display, but rather poor on the large monitor (blurry). It's still usable. The feature can't be turned off.\n\n*Windows scaling looks horrible: the display you used to login looks better - the other one very blurry. Also some important apps such as Chrome v36 are most of the time blurry (poorly scaled). Turning off per-display scaling solves the blurriness.\n\n*Linux - there is no support in any Window/Desktop Manager that I know of.\n\n\nAny thoughts? Cheers!\n\nA: Good news for KDE Plasma users.  It looks like the 5.11 BETA has this feature included and working on Wayland.  If you use Kubuntu you can use the backports ppa to get the latest and greatest faster.

See my answer for a relative question:\nIs it possible to have two different DPI configurations for two different screens?\n", "Q: Completely unable to install python2.7-dev Am totally stuck!\nAm unable completely to install python2.7-dev on my Ubuntu13.04.

Is there a way to set these settings permanently?\nAlso, is there an option in Chrome so that it doesn't use proxy for specific domains (analogous to the No proxy for setting in Firefox)?\n\nA: For Unity: In \"system settings\", go to \"network\" then \"network proxy\" : you can then set your proxy system wide.\nFor setting user and password , set it like this :\nuser:password@proxy:port    \nFor Lubuntu , Xubuntu etc...: look this thread How do I set systemwide proxy servers in Xubuntu, Lubuntu or Ubuntu Studio?\n\nA: Open a Terminal and type sudo -H nautilus\nType your password then press Ctrl+L and type /usr/share/applications/ and press Enter\nNow find google-chrome and right-click on chrome icon and select \"Properties\".\nNext, Add the following option at the end of command text box, there.\n--proxy-server=\"IP proxy Server:port\" (ex: --proxy-server=\"127.0.0.1:8080\")\nit's look like this (it's the same for Chrome):\n\nclose the window and if the chrome browser is still running, then close the browser and restart again. Finally you can use chrome browser with proxy.\n--proxy-bypass-list:\nIf you want to tell google-chrome to NOT use a proxy with specific domains use --proxy-bypass-list command. This command specifies a list of hosts for whom we bypass proxy settings and use direct connections. Ignored if --proxy-auto-detect or --no-proxy-server are also specified. This is a comma-separated list of bypass rules.\nHere is List of Chromium Command Line that used in google-chrome too.\n\nA: Semi-automated way\nI have found @αғsнιη answer to be most helpful.\nHowever, every update of Google Chrome resulted in resetting the desktop entry and proxy settings. It is quite frustrating editing it again, and again.\n\nInstead of manual work, you can change the entry with a short script.\nSimply paste it to terminal:\nsudo sed '/^Exec/s/$/ --proxy-server=\"10.0.2.2:3128\"/' /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop  -i\n\nObviously, you need to change the IP to your proxy server.\n\nThis appends all lines starting with Exec with your proxy setting, which is the manual way of setting the proxy.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: How do I set systemwide proxy servers in Xubuntu, Lubuntu or Ubuntu Studio? points to the file /etc/environment where you can insert the following lines as root: \nhttp_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\nhttps_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\nftp_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\nno_proxy=\"localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com\"\n\nThe top answer (very elaborate) also contains a script to enable/disable on demand. (But if you need that, Firefox has an options page for choosing the proxy and you might want to consider using it).\n\nA: When the proxy settings are in the environment proxy variables, Chrome did not work by putting the full proxy settings on the launcher.\n--proxy-server=\"IP proxy Server:port\" (ex: --proxy-server=\"127.0.0.1:8080\") \nBut it worked when I put it to detect the automatic configurations\n--proxy-auto-detect \nAnd it worked in Vivaldi.\n\nA: Google Chrome and Chromium obey the environment proxy variables (http_proxy, no_proxy, etc.) and the proxies set via gsettings. gsettings comes preinstalled on [XL]ubuntu, so this is one way which doesn't need sudo privileges.\nThe keys org.gnome.system.proxy.http[s].{host,port,authentication-user,authentication-user} (and similar options for FTP and SOCKS proxies) and the proxy autoconfiguration key org.gnome.system.proxy.autoconfig_url can be used for this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.http host \"proxy.server.fqdn\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.http port \"3128\"\n\nA proxy exception list can be set using the ignore-hosts key:\ngsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy ignore-hosts \"['localhost', '127.0.0.0/8', '::1', '*.some.domain', '10.0.0.0/8']\" \n\nA no_proxy environment variable would look like:\nexport no_proxy=\"localhost,.some.domain,127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8\"\nexport NO_PROXY=\"localhost,.some.domain,127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8\"\n\nYou can set this in ~/.profile or ~/.pam_environment (without the export).\n\nA: One option I use is the Proxy SwitchyOmega extension. It allows some IP addresses or domains to be exempted, as you ask for.\nIt has a nice GUI instead of needing to deal with command line arguments. It also supports Chrome Sync, so you can get up and running with your proxy settings on a new computer quickly.\nYou can also set it up so that using the proxy can be switched on or off with a single click.\n\nA: Just execute below command in terminal \nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\n\nin Command value append below line\n--proxy-server=\"192.168.1.251:8080\" \n\nChange it with your proxy. its example of non - authentication proxy.

Please correct this from the partitioning menu\". The drive was formatted on Win Xp as Fat32.\nCan anyone please walk me through the setup?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Update for Ubuntu 18.04 and above\nNew installations of recent versions of Ubuntu does not use a separate swap partition any more. They use a swap file by default.\nOriginal Answer\nUbuntu installation needs two partitions in their own formats. It won't work with FAT32.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you don't have any any important data in the external hard\ndrive. If you do, copy them some place else. After you select Something else, make sure you are modifying your external hard drive and not the internal one. The internal drive is usually /dev/sda. The external one can be /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc or something else.\n\n\n*Delete the existing FAT32 partition in the external hard drive.\n\n\n*Create two partitions. The first is called /. This is the main\npartition where Ubuntu will be installed. Create format this\npartition ext4. Leave 2 to 4 GB space in the end for the next\npartition.\n\n\n*The second partition is called Swap. This is used as virtual\nmemory. Use the remaining 2 to 4 GB space to create this partition.\nIt should have the partition type Linux-Swap. It does not have any\nmount point.\nMake sure Device for bootloader installation: at the bottom points to your external hard drive. It can be /dev/sdb or dev/sdc or something else.\nHope this helps\n\nA: The problem is simple and is clear:\n\nNo root system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu\n\nIn order to install ubuntu you should define 4  partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*One is a swap area should be double the size of the RAM.\n\n*For the root system and should be something from 10 to 20 GB.\n\n*For the home directory to be installed and can be anything (you choose according to your needs).\n\n*For the Grub and it should be at least 1MB\n\n\nTo add these just select the appropriate one from the list:partition\nIn the Image the / stands for root.\nYou might also want to check this post: http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html\n", "Q: Auto-enter master password in KeePassX on launch I use KeepassX only for unimportant sites and it's set up to autostart.

I dont know wich logs are necessary in this case.\n\nA: You are using the default nouveau driver, for your nvidia graphics card. This is a reverse engineered driver and is known to cause trouble with power management. \nFrom what I can tell from my experience suspend with nouveau is gambling, depends very much on the kernel version, graphics card etc.\nThe first thing I would try if I were you is installing the official nvidia driver: Note, though, it is proprietary, but I would try to see if it resolves your problem, because then we know pretty much for sure nouveau is the component to blame. (Looking at all the errors on your screen I am pretty sure though nouveau is the trouble maker.)\nIf you have concern because the proprietary driver is closed source, you can set up a second ubuntu install on an external hdd/usb and try it there.\nTo try the proprietary nvidia driver do the following:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\nand reboot your machine after the process finished.\nPlease report back if that changes something for you.\nIf not, my second try would be disconnecting all external hardware (usb devices like scanners, printers etc.), to make sure nothing external triggers a wakeup.\nEDIT: Please also paste the output of\nlspci\n\nsince the error message on your screen says \"Device 0000:01:00.0 failed to suspend\" and that command helps us to find what device exactly that is, but I suppose your graphics card.\nAdded by questioner:\nFor all who have similar Problem with a Nvidia Card in a laptop, If you have further trouble (eg. if your OpenGL Version is still low, or your laptop needs a lot of energy), check if your card uses OPTIMUS technology. This means that you have an additional graphics card, which is used for not graphical expensive Applications. In contrast this second card is optimized for low energy usage. You can search on the in the optimus scetion on the Nvidia Site for your card. If found your card there install also bumblebee and bumblebee-nvidia. After that, to run a Application with your powerful graphics card you have to run your Application via\n$ optirun <path to app>\n\n", "Q: help configuring my samba file server Hello everyone I have installed all the files I needed for my samba file server. I have also installed the gadmin-samba 0.3.2. I am trying to set a user-name and password also I would like to know how to ad my laptops I own to the machines allowed to connect to it. it can be in terminal but preferably in gadmin-samba which is like a GUI. please be very descriptive my systems is Ubuntu 14.04 and Gadmin-Samba 0.3.2\n\nA: I can get you there with there from the commandline.  I don't use Gadmin.\nFirst off, most of the default would probably work without making any changes.  All you should have to do is just add the folder specifications you want to share.\nPick a folder or create a folder called, for instance, \"myshare\".  Now edit and append these lines to the /etc/samba/smb.conf file:\n[myshare]\n        comment = My Shared Area\n        path = /myshare\n        writeable = yes\n        browseable = yes\n        valid users = user1, user2\n\nThe [myshare] is the name of the share that will appear on the network for connecting to the resource.  This doesn't have to match he actual folder name.  But having something similar to it will have you to remember the resource you have setup.\nThe valid users are the ones you have created to have access to the shares.  The user names will have to be a name that is actually on the Ubuntu machine.  You'll still have to add the names to Samba's access list.  You can do this with:\n$ sudo smbpasswd -a user1\n$ sudo smbpasswd -a user2\n\nWhen the users are added you can always modify their passwords with:\n$ sudo smbpasswd user1\nAfter that is done you connect to the share with Windows the same way as you would any other windows shared folder.  The network resource would be:\nFor windows:\n\\\\machine\\myshare\n\nFor linux it would be:\n//machine/myshare\n\nA convenient way (semi GUI) is to bring up your file browser (either Windows or Linux) and type in the associated shared connection above into the address field of the file browser (windows' explorer or Ubuntu's natilus).\nYou can also connect to the Linux shared by typing this into a command terminal on Windows:\nexplorer \\\\machine\\myshare\n\n", "Q: Using \"MTNL 3G Jadoo\" data card on Ubuntu I am trying to use \"MTNL 3G Jadoo\" data card (Teracom LW272) with Ubuntu 12.04. On connecting, it gets mounted as a drive containing the client installation .deb file. I opened the .deb file in Ubuntu Software Center and installed it. I searched for \"MTNL\" in Ubuntu search and found \"MTNL 3G Modem\" application. But it won't run. I found it is installed in /opt/MTNL-3GModem. I tried running it unsuccessfully from the terminal with\nsudo /opt/MTNL-3GModem/ModemClient\n\nAny idea how to get it working?\n\nA: Here's how i got it working on 12.04:\nI checked for any missing dependencies with ldd /opt/MTNL-3GModem/ModemClient and found libudev0:i386 to be missing. So the application is 32-bit and i have 64-bit Ubuntu. I also found that libudev0:i386 is no longer included with Ubuntu 13.04. I tried installing it with apt-get but got some errors. I finally downloaded it from here and installed it with Ubuntu Software Center. Then i started the MTNL application with sudo /opt/MTNL-3GModem/ModemClient and... success! Note that the application needs to be run with sudo.\nUPDATE for 14.04:\nOn upgrading to 14.04, the MTNL application failed to connect (on clicking the 'Connect' button). I found that it was using the gksudo command in its shell scripts, which is not available since 13.04. So I replaced gksudo with sudo in two files in /opt/MTNL-3GModem: connectnet.sh and deconnectnet.sh. And that fixed the issue.\n", "Q: I have problem and I cant install someone help me packages have unmet dependencies: wine1.6: Depends: wine1.6-i386? \nI marked the problem i cant install with ubuntu center and Synaptic i cant repair !! \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies: wine1.6: Depends: wine1.6-i386 (= 1: 1.6.1-0ubuntu1 PPA1 ~ ~ precise1) but it is not installable E: Unmet dependencies.

And since Adobe no longer upgrades flash for linux, my flash is probably hopelessly out of date. Is there an alternative  or workaround (simple please--I am not a computer geek, just a user who hates Microsoft) that will allow me to watch movies/tv in Xubuntu? I want to reformat and completely get rid of Windows, but until I can figure out how to get these to stream in linux, I need it. I have tried Chromium and Opera on Xubuntu, but the problem persists.\nThe folks at Acorn tv recently switched servers to Brightcove, and the second they did that, all of the linux people suddenly couldn't watch their content any more. (It worked fine before the switch.) I contacted them (4 times!!!) and they assured me they were working on it, but as of yesterday, they suggested I unsubscribe and offered me money back because they said...\n\"I'm sorry but we are unable to offer guaranteed support on Linux. You should be able to watch DRM protected content if the browser you use supports Flash version 12.2 or higher. For more info, please see: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/protected-video-content-play.html.\"\nBut then they added... \n\"If you really love the content and you still wish to watch, you might try subscribing through the YouTube channel instead. All of the content is the same and YouTube is able to work on more platforms. The channel is at www.youtube.com/acorntv.\"\nProblem is, when I pay to watch movies on YouTube, I can't. Why would this be different? Or is it? I am lost. Can someone please suggest something?\nThanks!\n\nA: You might try using Google Chrome.  Your movies might require (as you hinted to) an updated version of flash.  Adobe stopped supporting Flash for Linux, so other browsers will either depend on workarounds are an outdated version of flash.\nGoogle has a license with Adobe which they incorporate in their chrome browser.  Google also has native support for Linux.  So running Google Chrome for your flash support might be better resolution than rebooting into Windows.  I run different browsers depending on particular instances for various site support.  While my preference is Opera, I still retain Firefox and Google Chrome for sites that are more optimized for those browsers.\n\nA: AHAH!  Just when I had given up, I found a solution!!\nWhen I tried to stream from Acorn TV I got the message \"update to Flash 12\" which can't be done directly. Google Chrome does NOT solve the problem. Apparently only Flash 12.2 and later versions will handle the DRM system used.\nPipelight is a special browser plug-in which allows the Windows plug-ins to work inside a Linux browser.  Michael Muller and his team have made a brilliant job of this, and have made a great web site which explains everything at https://launchpad.net/pipelight\nThe installation is very clearly explained and only took 4 lines in the terminal.  I am using Linux Mint, so followed the steps for Ubuntu, found here [http://pipelight.net/cms/install/installation-ubuntu.html]\nMany thanks to the Pipelight Development Team!!!\n", "Q: What is the $BASH_COMMAND variable good for? According to the Bash manual, the environment variable BASH_COMMAND contains\n\nThe command currently being executed or about to be executed, unless the shell is executing a command as the result of a trap, in which case it is the command executing at the time of the trap. \n\nTaking that trap corner case aside, if I understand correctly this means that when I execute a command, the variable BASH_COMMAND contains that command. It's not absolutely clear whether that variable is unset after the command execution (i.e., is only avaialble while the command is running, but not after), though one might argue that since it is \"the command currently being executed or about to be executed\", it is not the command that was just executed.\nBut let's check:\n$ set | grep BASH_COMMAND=\n$ \n\nEmpty. I would have expected to see BASH_COMMAND='set | grep BASH_COMMAND=' or maybe just BASH_COMMAND='set', but empty surprised me.\nLet's try something else:\n$ echo $BASH_COMMAND\necho $BASH_COMMAND\n$ \n\nWell that makes sense. I execute the command echo $BASH_COMMAND and so the variable BASH_COMMAND contains the string echo $BASH_COMMAND. Why did it work this time, but not before?\nLet's do the set thing again:\n$ set | grep BASH_COMMAND=\nBASH_COMMAND='echo $BASH_COMMAND'\n$\n\nSo wait. It was set when I executed that echo command, and it was not unset afterwards. But when I executed set again, BASH_COMMAND was not set to the set command. No matter how often I execute the set command here, the result stays the same. So, is the variable set when executing echo, but not when executing set? Let's see.\n$ echo Hello AskUbuntu\nHello AskUbuntu\n$ set | grep BASH_COMMAND=\nBASH_COMMAND='echo $BASH_COMMAND'\n$\n\nWhat? So the variable was set when I executed echo $BASH_COMMAND, but not when I executed echo Hello AskUbuntu? Where's the difference now? Is the variable only set when the current command itself actually forces the shell to evaluate the variable? Let's try something different. Maybe some external command this time, not a bash builtin, for a change.\n$ /bin/echo $BASH_COMMAND\n/bin/echo $BASH_COMMAND\n$ set | grep BASH_COMMAND=\nBASH_COMMAND='/bin/echo $BASH_COMMAND'\n$\n\nHmm, ok... again, the variable was set. So is my current guess correct? Is the variable only set when it has to be evaluated? Why? Why? For performance reasons? Let's do one more try. We'll try to grep for $BASH_COMMAND in a file, and since $BASH_COMMAND should then contain a grep command, grep should grep for that grep command (i.e., for itself). so let's make an appropriate file:\n$ echo -e \"1 foo\\n2 grep\\n3 bar\\n4 grep \\$BASH_COMMAND tmp\" > tmp\n$ grep $BASH_COMMAND tmp\ngrep: $BASH_COMMAND: No such file or directory\ntmp:2 grep                                      <-- here, the word \"grep\" is RED\ntmp:4 grep $BASH_COMMAND tmp                    <-- here, the word \"grep\" is RED\ntmp:2 grep                                      <-- here, the word \"grep\" is RED\ntmp:4 grep $BASH_COMMAND tmp                    <-- here, the word \"grep\" is RED\n$ set | grep BASH_COMMAND=\nBASH_COMMAND='grep --color=auto $BASH_COMMAND tmp'\n$\n\nOk, interesting. The command grep $BASH_COMMAND tmp got expanded to grep grep $BASH_COMMAND tmp tmp (the variable gets expanded just that once, of course), and so I grepped for grep, once in a file $BASH_COMMAND which doesn't exist, and twice in the file tmp.\nQ1: Is my current assumption correct that:\n\n\n*\n\n*BASH_COMMAND is only set when a command tries to actually evaluate it; and\n\n*it is not unset after execution of a command, even though the description may lead us to believe so?\n\n\nQ2: If yes, why? Performance? If no, how else can the behavior in the above command sequence be explained?\nQ3: Lastly, is there any scenario in which this variable could actually be meaningfully used? I was actually trying to use it within $PROMPT_COMMAND to analyze the command being executed (and do some stuff depending on that), but I can't, because as soon as, within my $PROMPT_COMMAND, I execute a command to look at the variable $BASH_COMMAND, the variable gets sets to that command. Even when I do MYVARIABLE=$BASH_COMMAND right at the beginning of my $PROMPT_COMMAND, then MYVARIABLE contains the string MYVARIABLE=$BASH_COMMAND, because an assignment is a command too. (This question is not about how I could obtain the current command within a $PROMPT_COMMAND execution. There are other ways, I know.)\nIt's a bit like with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Just by observing the variable, I change it.\n\nA: Now that Q3 has been answered (correctly, in my opinion: BASH_COMMAND is useful in traps and hardly anywhere else), let's give Q1 and Q2 a shot.\nThe answer to Q1 is: the correctness of your assumption is undecidable. The truth of neither of the bullet points can be established, as they ask about unspecified behaviour. By its specification, the value of BASH_COMMAND is set to the text of a command for the duration of the execution of that command. The spec does not state what its value must be in any other situation, i.e. when no command is being executed. It could have any value or none at all.\nThe answer to Q2 \"If no, how else can the behavior in the above command sequence be explained?\" then follows logically (if somewhat pedantically): it is explained by the fact that the value of BASH_COMMAND is undefined. Since its value is undefined, it can have any value, which is exactly what the sequence shows.\nPostscript\nThere is one point where I think you're indeed hitting a soft spot in the spec. It's where you say: \n\nEven when I do MYVARIABLE=$BASH_COMMAND right at the beginning of my\n  $PROMPT_COMMAND, then MYVARIABLE contains the string\n  MYVARIABLE=$BASH_COMMAND, because an assignment is a command too.\n\nThe way I read the bash man page, the bit in italics is not true. The section SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION explains how first the variable assignments on the command line are set aside, and then \n\nIf  no command name results [in other words, there were only variable\n  assignments], the variable assignments affect the current shell\n  environment.\n\nThis suggests to me that variable assignments are not commands (and therefore exempt from showing up in BASH_COMMAND), like in other programming languages. This would then also explain why there isn't a line BASH_COMMAND=set in the output of set, set essentially being a syntactic 'marker' for variable assignment.\nOTOH, in the final paragraph of that section it says\n\nIf there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as\n  described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.\n\n... which suggests otherwise, and variable assignments are commands too.\n\nA: An inventive use for $BASH_COMMAND\nRecently found this impressive use of $BASH_COMMAND in implementing a macro-like functionality.\n\nThis is the core trick of the alias and replaces the use of the DEBUG trap. If you read the part in the previous post about the DEBUG trap, you’ll recognize the $BASH_COMMAND variable. In that post I said that it was set to the text of the command before each call to the DEBUG trap. Well, it turns out it’s set before the execution of every command, DEBUG trap or no (e.g. run ‘echo “this command = $BASH_COMMAND”‘ to see what I’m talking about). By assigning it a variable (just for that line) we capture BASH_COMMAND at the outermost scope of the command, which will contain the entire command.\n\nThe author's previous article also provides some good background while implementing a technique using a DEBUG trap. The trap is eliminated in the improved version.\n\nA: Answering to the third question: of course it can be used meaningfully in the way at Bash manual clearly hints – in a trap, e. g.:\n$ trap 'echo ‘$BASH_COMMAND’ failed with error code $?' ERR\n$ fgfdjsa\nfgfdjsa: command not found\n‘fgfdjsa’ failed with error code 127\n$ cat /etc/fgfdjsa\ncat: /etc/fgfdjsa: No such file or directory\n‘cat /etc/fgfdjsa’ failed with error code 1\n\n\nA: A seemingly common use for the trap...debug is to improve the titles that appear in the windowlist (^A\") when you are using \"screen\".\nI was trying to make the \"screen\", \"windowlist\" more usable so I started to find articles referencing \"trap...debug\".\nI found that the method using PROMPT_COMMAND to send the \"null title sequence\" did not work so well, so I reverted to the trap...debug method.\nHere is how you do it:\n1 Tell \"screen\" to look for the escape sequence (enable it) by putting \"shelltitle '$|bash:'\" into \"$HOME/.screenrc\".\n2 Turn off the propagation of the debug trap into sub-shells. This is important, because if it is enabled, everything gets mucked up, use: \"set +o functrace\".\n3 Send the title escape sequence for \"screen\" to interpret:\n    trap 'printf \"\\ek$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) $(whoami)@$(hostname):$(pwd) ${BASH_COMMAND}\\e\\\"' \"DEBUG\"\nIt's not perfect, but it helps, and you can use this method to put literally anything you like into the title\nSee the following \"windowlist\" (5 screens):\nNum Name                                                                                                                                         Flags\n1 bash:20161115232035 mcb@ken007:/home/mcb/ken007 RSYNCCMD=\"sudo rsync\" myrsync.sh -R -r \"${1}\" \"${BACKUPDIR}${2:+\"/${2}\"}\"                        $\n   2 bash:20161115230434 mcb@ken007:/home/mcb/ken007 ls --color=auto -la                                                                              $\n   3 bash:20161115230504 mcb@ken007:/home/mcb/ken007 cat bin/psg.sh                                                                                   $\n   4 bash:20161115222415 mcb@ken007:/home/mcb/ken007 ssh ken009                                                                                       $\n   5 bash:20161115222450 mcb@ken007:/home/mcb/ken007 mycommoncleanup                                                                                  $\n", "Q: Software center disappeared after installing exelearning I have installed Ubuntu today and everything worked pefectly.

Currently I am using an Acer V11 laptop with a pre-intalled Windows 8.1. I follow some guideline (http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html) which successfully install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS alongside Windows 8.1 with UEFI enabled all the way throughout the installation and my current usage and a GRUB. But I got into some problem. \nThe dual boot mostly works fine as I am able to successfully boot into either one of the Windows 8.1 or Ubuntu when stating my laptop. However it ran into issue after I start the device and use Ubuntu for a while (2 hour for instance) and then restart it: If I press the restart from Ubuntu, the grub still shows and I am still able to choose the Windows Boot Manager. But the Windows loading process was stuck at the Acer Loading Screen and I am not able to see the standard circular Win8 loading progress bar. Does someone know why would this happens?\n\nA: Hmm I had some issues with secure boot being on.  However, try removing the option to view boot manager from Windows.  Windows cannot handle more than one boot record on UEFI, no matter what you do.  You can change the boot order via MoBo BIOS by selecting the UEFI option under your boot system menu.  you should see something like an onboard PXE IPv4 and IPv6 NIC Boot and the two OS Options (windows and Ubuntu with numbers on the side in ()s.  Find the command to move Ubuntu up to the first choice.  This is going to always boot to Ubuntu, and having Windows just boot without you choosing an OS will remedy the issue.  Also turn Secure Boot off.\n\nA: Maybe you must go to bios option, and configure advance boot option, change boot mode from CSM boot to EUFI boot option, save setting and restart. \n", "Q: Tkinter on Ubuntu 14.04 seems not to work I receive following Traceback:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"tkinter_basic_frame.py\", line 4, in <module>\n    from Tkinter import Tk, Frame, BOTH\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk/Tkinter.py\", line 42, in \n    raise ImportError, str(msg) + ', please install the python-tk package'\nImportError: No module named _tkinter, please install the python-tk package\n\nThis is the demoscript I'm trying to run:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom Tkinter import Tk, Frame, BOTH\n\n\nclass Example(Frame):\n\n    def __init__(self, parent):\n        Frame.__init__(self, parent, background=\"white\")   \n\n        self.parent = parent\n\n        self.initUI()\n\n    def initUI(self):\n\n        self.parent.title(\"Simple\")\n        self.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    root = Tk()\n    root.geometry(\"250x150+300+300\")\n    app = Example(root)\n    root.mainloop()  \n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()  \n\nFrom my knowledge Tkinter should be included in Python 2.7.

I had not interrupted any updates, the only unusual thing I'd done was un-selected a suggested update (I think it might have been an update to bsdutils, since there as something that looked dodgy about it - some missing information about the proposed update).  After that, each time a software update window appeared, it would contain just the title bar and border.  I could resize it, but it was blank.\nI tried the above advice, but dpkg does not support those options.  I suspect the advice was meant to say:\n'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade'.\nI did that, and it downloaded and update a bunch of stuff.  I also had a reboot pending, but I chose not to do that.\nNone of the above helped.\nI couldn't find the update process easily using ps, but did track it down via the GUI \"System Tools\" -> \"System Monitor\" tool.  From that I discovered the equivalent command line:\n    /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/update-manager --no-update --no-focus-on-map\nIf I ran that, it worked normally.\nHowever, I noticed that regardless of whether update-manager was visibly running (either the small blank window the system would occasionally produce, or a normal one if I ran it from the command line), that there was always an \"Update-manager\" process running.\nThinking that maybe some part of update-manager had somehow gotten \"wedged\", I selected it and chose \"End Process\", ignoring the dire warnings.  From that point on, the problem of the small blank Software Updater window vanished.\n\nA: I had this very same issue and as user75601 pointed out it seems to be caused by an orphaned update-manager process. You can quickly check from terminal with:\npgrep -fl update-manager\n\nand can kill all the update-manager processes with:\npkill -f update-manager\n\nStart the update manager as usual from Dash or Launcher and all should be normal again.\n\nA: I had this problem today, after I forgot update-manager was updating my system and I logged out, aborting the update-manager.  Upon logging back in, update-manager could only show a zero-size window, only the window border was visible.\nI did have other issues, which I had to clean up using dpkg (you should google for any specific dpkg-related problems you might have, and fix them).\nIn my case, I had to remove a lock on and then 'sudo dpkg update' and 'sudo dpkg upgrade'.\nThen I rebooted, and my update-manager was back to normal.\nSo I suspect that my update-manager was confused due to the invalid state that I had after aborting my software installation.  I had to use dpkg to clean up and finish the pending installations and reboot.  The reboot was probably necessary due to a kernel update.\n", "Q: Forgot password I have a dell mini that would not boot to Ubuntu. It sat in my closet for over a year and a half.

There is an easier way of upgrading python3-scipy 0.13.3 to python3-scipy 0.14.0  than using pip3.\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall python3-scipy.\nsudo apt-get remove python3-scipy\n\n\n*Download the python3-scipy package for Ubuntu 14.10.\nVisit http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/python3-scipy, select the version of python3-scipy that matches your operating system's architecture, select a mirror, and download the python3-scipy .deb file.\n\n*Install the python3-scipy package for Ubuntu 14.10.\nDouble-click on the python3-scipy .deb file that you downloaded to open it in the Ubuntu Software Center, and install it just like you would install any other package. The python3-scipy .deb file for Ubuntu 14.10 has the same dependency package versions as the python3-scipy package from the Ubuntu Software Center, so it should install in Ubuntu 14.04 without any problems.\nIn Ubuntu 16.04 it is possible to install python3-scipy 0.16.1 from the default Ubuntu repositories.\n", "Q: Unable to write to /var/log/btmp I recently had a bunch of entries in my btmp log [because of a boneheaded move on my part] I resolved the issue, but now I would like to clear that log, I copied it somewhere else for reference and then I attempted to null the file, but to no avail. I then checked the permissions for the file itself and everything looks right? Just unsure of why it will not let sudo access the file. \nuser@localhost:~$ sudo cat /dev/null > /var/log/btmp\n-bash: /var/log/btmp: Permission denied\nuser@localhost:~$ ls -a -l /var/log/btmp\n-rw-rw---- 1 root utmp 5502336 Aug 20 18:59 /var/log/btmp\n\nJust looking for some other ideas.. I tried changing the permissions and then changing them back just because. I also tried a few other ways to remove the text. But I want to figure out why this doesn't just work. Thanks for any help!\n\nA: Your command does not use sudo to write to the log file - it (unnecessarily) uses sudo to cat /dev/null. The writing (output redirection) via the > operator is still done as your regular user.\nYou can do either of the following\nsudo sh -c 'cat /dev/null > /var/log/btmp'\n\nor\ncat /dev/null | sudo tee /var/log/btmp\n\nhowever there's really no need to cat anything; you can truncate the file equally well simply by redirecting nothing to it\nsudo -i\n> /var/log/btmp\nexit\n\nor by using the truncate command\nsudo truncate -s0 /var/log/btmp \n\n", "Q: Microsoft Onenote alternative with support for my stylus I know how many questions about onenote alternatives and I read through them but didn't find something fitting for me.\nSo what am I looking for?  \n\n\n*\n\n*Support for my Stylus / hand written notes\n\n*Adding files/pictures to the notes\n\n*Some managing system to organize the notes / somewhat like OneNote\n\n\nA: There is, but you will need two programs. What I found very useful from OneNote is the ability to upload powerpoints, PDFs, docs, images, etc and type text on them directly, and use my stylus (touch pen) to write and draw diagrams directly on the files. I also liked the organization and search function of OneNote. To have these functions on Ubuntu, install Xournal if you want to use a touch pen (or point cursor) to draw/write on your files (export your powerpoint as PDF before opening with Xournal), then export your Xournal file as PDF, and install Mendeley to organize all your PDFs. Unlike OneNote, in Mendeley, you can direct select text, copy text, and click on links directly from the PDF files in Mendely. If you simply want to take notes and organize them, install EverPad. With Mendely, you can also search text in all of your files. You can sync Mendeley to all other devices and open them online after you create a free online account.\n", "Q: How to have the intallation file actually work I've never even been able to get Ubuntu to work . . . and I've tried multiple times.

(No idea why it stopped working.) Might an upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04.1 solve this problem, or should I solve this problem before risking an upgrade?  Thanks!\n\nA: The upgrade itself from 12.04 to 14.04.1 won't change anything that's in your home folder. However, when you boot into 14.04.1, changes might be made by the programs in that release. Therefore, any folders (or lack thereof) in your home directory won't impact the upgrade.\nThe most likely reason that your .gnupg folder isn't getting backed up by the backup service is because the folder's permissions are 0700, meaning only you and any programs that run under your user can access that folder. Most likely, the backup service is running under its own user account, and therefore can't read that folder.\n", "Q: Disabled WiFi but it keeps re-enabling itself; want it to stay disabled I have an Alienware X51 desktop with a wireless card, I have it connected via ethernet and want to permanently disable WiFi from ever using itself.\nWhen running Windows, I go to device manager and rightclick-disable the Wireless card and that takes care of my problem.

It is so with my Opera browser, but only because I added this specific association using the browser's configuration facility. Otherwise, in the rest of the environment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running xdg-open apt://foo.bar opens elinks (my www-browser alternative).\n\n*Running gnome-open apt://foo.bar opens the Software Center.\n\n*Opening gconf-editor, I see a key /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/apt whose value is apturl \"%s\" and it's enabled. This configuration seems to be ignored, which is reasonably expected, as GConf is considered obsolete.\n\n*Opening dconf-editor, I can't see anything related to URL handlers or protocols in /desktop/gnome\nIt looks a bit messy to my eyes (just teasing with this wording, nothing bad)\nWhat's underneath?\nSide note: I'm looking for something which preferably works even when the full desktop environment is not loaded, like when running an i3wm session with only gsettings-daemon (and other stuff unrelated to this case) loaded.\nUpdate\nAnother way to “register” a protocol handler is with *.desktop files and their MIME-Type; e.g. MimeType=application/<the-protocol>;.\nI found a /usr/share/applications/ubuntu-software-center.desktop with this content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Ubuntu Software Center\nGenericName=Software Center\nComment=Lets you choose from thousands of applications available for Ubuntu\nExec=/usr/bin/software-center %u\nIcon=softwarecenter\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=PackageManager;GTK;System;Settings;\nMimeType=application/x-deb;application/x-debian-package;x-scheme-handler/apt;\nStartupNotify=true\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=software-center\nKeywords=Sources;PPA;Install;Uninstall;Remove;Purchase;Catalogue;Store;\n\nThis one explains why gnome-open apt://foo.bar opens the Software Center instead of apturl.\nSo I installed this apturl.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=/usr/bin/apturl %u\nName=APT‑URL\nComment=APT‑URL handler\nIcon=\nCategories=Application;Network;\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/apt;\n\nAfter update-desktop-database and even after rebooting, both xdg-open and gnome-open still do the same and ignore this user desktop file, which as usual with user desktop‑files, should override the one in /usr/share/applications/.\nMaybe there is something special with desktop files specifying x-scheme-handler MIME type and they are not handled the usual way.\nThe desktop‑file way does not answer the question.\n\nA: xdg-mime\nMaybe more elegant (in this example I use \"apt\", change it for any other scheme):\n\n*\n\n*Check registered MIME-types in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list.\n\n*Add the apt.desktop file (here some examples) to ~/.local/share/applications/ (user-wide) or /usr/share/applications/ (system-wide).\n\n*Build cache database of MIME types handled by desktop files (may need sudo):\nupdate-desktop-database\n\n*Register a protocol with\nxdg-mime default apt.desktop x-scheme-handler/apt\n\nThis will append the new MIME Type for the scheme to either ~/.config/mimeapps.list or ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list. You can register the new mime-type for all users on the system sudo xdg-mime install --mode system <xml file>.\nTest with xdg-open \"apt://foo.bar\".\nSee also Adding a MIME Type.\n\nA: Open ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list and add a line like:\nx-scheme-handler/apt=apturl.desktop\n\n\nA: When launching href links that look like:\nzoommtg://zoom.us/join?action=join&confno=000000\n\nThis is what worked for me with zoom\necho \"x-scheme-handler/zoommtg=Zoom.desktop\" >> ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\n", "Q: Evolution MAPI & Evo EWS not working in Ubuntu 14.04 I recently upgraded my laptop from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS without problems. First thing I tried is to reconnect Evo to our company's Exchange server. I installed evo-mapi and the evo-ews package and tried to connect to the exchange server by using ews and mapi. In both cases I receive the error, that evo cannot resolve a hostname. In the case of EWS  I receive the error, that the server running the EWS service cannot be found:\n[ raptor ] /var/crash > EWS_DEBUG=2 evolution\n\n (evolution:5257): camel-WARNING **: Failed to initialize NSS SQL database in sql:/etc/pki/nssdb: NSS error -8187\nsh: 1: /usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer: not found\nsh: 1: /usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer: not found\n*** NSPlugin Wrapper *** ERROR: failed to execute NSPlugin viewer\n< HTTP/1.1 2 Cannot resolve hostname (myserver.mydomain.com)\n< Soup-Debug-Timestamp: 1408604840\n< Soup-Debug: ESoapMessage 0 (0x7fe051025db0)\n\n(Changed the server name above...)\nIn the case of MAPI I receive the (very strange) error: \"Error resolving 'http': Name or service not known\" the moment I try to authenticate (either basic or Kerberos - that makes no difference).\nI tried nslookup/dig to resolve the hostnames I specified in the configuration.

I captured some packages by using tcpdump and indeed: evo (or the MAPI plugin) asks for the host 'http'. So finally I decided to add an entry to /etc/hosts:\nuuu.vvv.www.xxx http http.domain.com\n\nI pointed this entry to the server running the EWS & autoconfiguration service - I'm not an Exchange specialist, I'm not sure, what this server is used for in in the Exchange environment. It seems to be something like a load balancer. \nAnyway: adding this server helped. I was able to authenticate and the MAPI account was created within Evolution. \nAfter account creation I changed /etc/hosts again and pointed the host 'http' to a normal linux server. The MAPI account still works with this entry. So it seems, that evo just needs  to be able to resolve the host. If you delete the entry, evo throws and error, that the host 'http' cannot be resolved. \n", "Q: Ubuntu + Wacom Intuos 4 + MyPaint HELP!

This command unload the driver; if it has been unloaded before for whatever reason it can spew an error) \n\n*Reload the driver: \nsudo modprobe wacom \n\n\n*plug the tablet again. \nYou can try to switch step 3 and 4 too. \nNotice however that many programs will not detect the tablet unless stopped and restarted. \nThe correct solution would be to understand where the problem is. A broken cable can really mess things up; this would be the first thing I'll check. You can try to see if you have some error in /var/log/syslog when the problem occurs. \n", "Q: Macbook keyboard problem I'm running Ubuntu Studio 14.04 on my Macbook 3,1. It worked well until today. The internal keyboard doesn't work properly anymore. Most keys don't work at all, while a few produce the wrong characters. For example, the keys J, K and L produce the numbers 1, 2 and 3.\nIt's not a hardware issue, in Mac OS everything is still fine. My external keyboard also works correctly.\nCan anybody help me?\n\nA: Solved by OP in comments\n\nI don't know why, but the problem was solved by pressing F6 twice.\n\nFYI, this is because the keyboard has a number pad built in. F6 disables this, and means you can type your letters rather than numbers.\n\n\nPress the Caps Lock key. num. (F6) to activate the keypad.\n\nSource\n", "Q: How to start a GUI application from cron?

When I check echo $DISPLAY in the terminal it returned 1.  So DISPLAY=:1 worked for me. (on Ubuntu 20.04)\n\nA: Cron runs in an environment that knows nothing about the display manager ($DISPLAY isn't set). Your terminal window that you've been testing in has this set for it. If you tried it in a \"real\" terminal, or over SSH, you'd see it break.\nIf you've only got one X server running, just specifying the display might work:\n* * * * *    DISPLAY=:0 firefox ...\n\nYou could probably put more effort into working out what display it's sitting under rather than assuming it's :0 but that will probably work most of the time.\nIf you just need to reload something a lot, look at Tab Auto Reload or similar Firefox plugins.\n\nA: I found this answer i am looking for addition to oli's :\nAfter a few search, I found that i need to run as a valid user instead from root. \n* * * * * su fadabi -c \"DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/firefox -new-window x.com/iqms/packetloss/iqmspacket2.html\"; \n\ntq\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 ATI/Intel Hybrid Graphics DPM I have a Dell Inspiron 3521 with hybrid ATI/Intel graphics.

I've researched and didn't find any answers, so I decided to ask here.\nThe /dev/sda2 disk of my WHM/Cpanel webserver got 100% full.\nThe /var folder is on the /dev/sda2 disk and I've found that the reason of 100% full disk is the /var/lib/mysql folder.\nTo fix it I need to move the /var/lib/mysql folder from /dev/sda2 to /home where I have a lot of space in disk.\nThen I used the command lines:\nservice mysql stop\ncp -r -p /var/lib/mysql/ /home/databasesmysql/\nmv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysql.backup/\nln -s /home/databasesmysql/ /var/lib/mysql\nservice mysql start\n\nOk, now to check if its running at the new location I just renamed the /var/lib/mysql to /var/lib/mysql.backup and MySQL stopped working.\nAlso when I rename the /home/databasesmysql folder MySQL also stop to work.\nI don't know whats happening, the symlink are using both locations?\n\nA: You are using ln -s with the arguments the wrong way round. Think cp when you use ln: the source comes first, the destination last.\nYou want to have a link /var/lib/mysql pointing to actual directory /home/databasesmysql. If you were copying you would do:\ncp -r /home/databasesmysql /var/lib/mysql\n\nSo with ln -s you do:\nln -s /home/databasesmysql /var/lib/mysql\n\n\nA: Did the directory /home/databasesmysql exist before running the commands? \nIf it did, the directory\n/var/lib/mysql was not copied to /home/databasesmysql,\nit was copied into /home/databasesmysql,\nso the copy is named /home/databasesmysql/mysql, instead of /home/databasesmysql.\nThat would mean the link /var/lib/mysql does not point to the right directory, of course.\n", "Q: Playonlinux - Steam games won't launch I'm running Ubuntu gnome 14.04.\nI installed Steam through Playonlinux and everything went fine.\nI installed some windows games through Steam.\nWhen I click 'play' to launch the game, I get a window saying Preparing to launch (insert game name) for a second or 2, then the window closes and nothing happens.\nI've seen many threads about this issue out there, but none had a solution that worked for me, and many of these threads are dead.\nOne of the things I tried was adding gameoverlayrenderer.dll in Wine libraries and set it to disable.

Also, you didn't really post that much info: it could be missing libraries, a bad graphics card (Wine really does not like integrated Intel cards, for example), an issue with sound, etc.\nYou could try launching Steam Wine from the terminal, and see if it outputs anything. Like this:\nwine \"~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Steam/steam.exe\"\n\nAlthough, in your case, you'll need to use the path PlayOnLinux decides to use, since I recall it uses separate profiles for different installs (have a look around in ~/.playonlinux/).\nThe WineHQ AppDB is also a really good source of information regarding specific programs: https://appdb.winehq.org/.\nAlso, Steam is already on Linux and there is already a ton of games available that have been ported over (or have been written native to Linux).\nEDIT:\nDon't expect it to work. Ever.\nThe issue here is missing .NET 4.0 support in WINE which a lot of games are built on (most likely in C#). Native .NET has never been one of Wine's strong points; it only managed to partially work a few years. Mono is here, however, it doesn't work to well with already-compiled code.\nThe other issue there is fixme:winhttp:get_system_proxy_autoconfig_url no support on this platform, which has had some luck at being solved by some people (e.g.: https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=22732 -- solved by installing winbind:i386 from the Ubuntu repo's, and updating the proprietry non-free nVidia drivers the OP had).\nHowever, I'd really suggest looking at the AppDB previously mentioned above. Have a look for the game you're trying to run, and there may just be some suggestions.\n", "Q: How do I give Ubuntu 14.04 more space? I installed Ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 8 for the first time yesterday, and I thought I would give it 75GB of space from my C: however, I didn't know I had to use 50GB for the installation and 16GB of swap space.\nHow do I give Ubuntu more space form my D: when installed already? \nI'm am very new to this, so please be very specific. \nLooking forward to your answers, thanks in advance\n\nA: Having a dedicated Swap partition is good but 16 GB of space just for swap is a serious waste of space since most modern systems come with 4 GB of memory so for day to day use, you're very very unlikely to run out of memory.\nAs Rinzwind mentioned, you don't need more than even 15-20 GB of Ubuntu partition to use it on daily basis. So as you've asked to get more space for currently installed Ubuntu while keeping the swapping intact. Here's what I'd suggest you to do.\nWhat we're gonna do is merge that swap partition back into your Ubuntu partition using following steps.\nFirstly, get rid of your Swap partition, follow this link for the same.\nSecond, merge that unallocated space left out by deleted Swap partition back into Ubuntu partition by resizing it, follow this article.\nNow comes the part where we create swap memory without having a dedicated partition.\nOpen terminal using Ctrl + Alt + T.\nRun following command to create swap file by running following command.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=512\n\nNotice the value of count, which denotes the size of your file in MB that you want to use as Swap memory, replace that with appropriate value as per your system memory. You can refer to Ubuntu Official Docs to know how much swap memory is recommended. 2 GB (2048 MB) of swap memory is enough for a machine with 4 GB of RAM.\nThe parameter of suggests location and name of swap file, here we create it in / (which is root) and name it as swapfile. I suggest you to leave it as it is.\nThis command will take a few seconds to complete, depending on how much size you set.\nNow, format the newly created file as swap memory using following command.\nsudo mkswap /swapfile\n\nOnce done, you need to tell Ubuntu to mount this file as Swap memory on startup, to do that, run following command.\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nThis will open fstab (File System Table) file in text editor. Add following line at the end of the file. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS FILE\n/swapfile none swap sw 0 0\n\nNow save the file and close the editor.\nNow just restart Ubuntu, and you'll see the Swap memory available in System Monitor.\nI understand this is overwhelming for first time user like you but it is worth trying to gain additional storage, so feel free to drop in comments if you're stuck anywhere. :)\n", "Q: How do I re-install Unity after uninstalling gnome-shell? I am using Ubuntu 14.04. I have big issues with the Unity desktop. I installed then uninstalled gnome-shell (using \"apt-get autoremove --purge gnome-shell\"). Since then, my desktop has no background and no icons. Plus, and this is the bothering part, unity is very unstable. On startup, there is a huge use of memory, much more than before. Sometimes, I also cannot minimize a window without having the desktop freezing and having to kill the process in question with tty1.

Save the downloaded archive file somewhere, say in ~/.airvpn. Extract it. Five files should be extracted. Try to make sure nobody but you can read the file user.key, because that one is secret.\nInstall the package named network-manager-openvpn-gnome, which is a plugin to NetworkManager handling OpenVPN connections. The install will automatically include all needed packages, like openvpn etc.\nClick on NetworkManager icon in top-right bar, and choose Edit Connections...\nClick Add, choose Import a saved VPN configuration, click Create... and choose a .ovpn file extracted from files generated by our Config Generator.\nThe imported information is displayed. Click Save... and close the NetworkManager Connections editor.\nFrom now on, the imported connections are showed under VPN Connections menu.

I've tried different things I found while googling, but nothing worked. Found this on an issue to another thing where the errors seem to be related. But since I'm not a programmer I can´t make anything of it:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2217794\nAny help on this would be appreciated since I´d like to continue to use some of these old 32-bit laptops here with the 14.04 lts version. But without the vmware player 3.1.6 I use with a already build image and software package I would have to find a completely new emulation solution... \n\nA: Try a newer version of vmware player, should work without any extra aditions with the new ubuntu.\nVmware player now is at verion 6.x , and is still free.\n", "Q: Shared folder not accessible Ubuntu 14.04. Two harddrives. I have created a folder on the slave drive and made it a shared folder using Nautilus. I can see the folder from another computer, but I can't see what's in it. Access denied. Why? I have folders on my primary drive shared, and that works just fine!\n\nA: If setting the shares up through Nautilus make sure the \"allow others to create and delete files in this folder\" box is ticked.\n", "Q: XServer Error could not create lock file I have tried to create a config file for my xserver with X -configure in the root shell (started ubuntu 14.04 in the save mode and selected root shell).\nBut it puts out this Error:\n(EE)\nFatal server error: \n(EE) Could not create lock file int /tmp/.tX0-lock\n(EE)\n(EE)\n Please consult the The X.Org Foundation support at http://wiki.x.org for help\n(EE)\n\nA: If you dropped to a root shell from the Ubuntu recovery mode, then the filesystem is mounted in read-only mode by default. You will probably need to re-mount with read-write permissions in order to allow X -configure to write the xorg.conf file:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n(note: there is no space between the remount and rw options - just a comma). Then try the X -configure command again.\n", "Q: How do you equally space out elements in a Row? Row{\n    width: parent.width\n    spacing: ????\n    Checkbox{}\n    Checkbox{}\n    Checkbox{}\n    Checkbox{}\n}\n\nSo just to be clear, the checkboxes should be spaced in such a manner that however wide the row is, it will expand or compress the spacing in accordance to this.\n\nA: The simplest solution would be to set width: parent.width/4 for each of the checkboxes.  If you want to keep the checkbox width set at some known value, you could instead set spacing: (parent.width - 4 * checkboxwidth)/3 on the Row.  Note that this will cause the elements to overlap when the parent is narrow.\nIf you're targeting Qt 5.1 or higher, you may want a RowLayout.  I'm still on 5.0, though, so I can't help you there.\nYet another way to do this would to be to put each CheckBox in an Item.  Each Item would have width: parent.width/4, and each CheckBox would have anchors.centerIn: parent.  This would give a half-width margin on the far left and far right, which may or may not be desired.\n", "Q: Error creating folder: Permission denied I am using VM Player for Ubuntu, then using WinSCP I need to copy the installer of a CMS to /var/www/html but it always says -\nError creating folder\nPermission denied.\nError code: 3\nError message from server: Permission denied\n\nEven when I try to create a folder it gives the same error. Thank you! I'm a student adnd this is for project purposes.\n\nA: That's because /var is owned by root, so you have to be temporarily root to access it ..\nThat's exactly what's the sudo command for, for making you look like another user, which is root by default.\nThe root user happens to have access to everything on the system, whether it belonged to you, root, or whatever ..\nSo, to create a folder in a folder that isn't yours, you use sudo.\nIn other words, you have to do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal Window\n\n*Copy the installer using the command: \nsudo cp <installer_path> <directory_to_copy_to>\n\n(directory would be /var/www/html in your case)\n\n*You'll be prompted to enter your password, do it.\n\n\nYou're done!\n\nA: Unless you have opened the WinSCP connection as root (which I don't recommend) you will need to transfer the file to somewhere that your regular user has write permission (such as your Ubuntu home directory). Then log in to the Ubuntu machine and move the file to the target directory using sudo.\n\nA: Use sudo command to create the directory in var because it owned by root.\nvfroot$ sudo mkdir SP\n\n", "Q: HDMI Output Not Working Properly \n\nExcuse my bad photographs but hopefully they help to illustrate the problems I'm having. The colour is messed up and does not look as it should. In addition to this I also do not have any audio output (although this isn't something that bothers me).\nAny help at all is greatly appreciated.\nIf this helps at all I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (64 bit).\n\nA: My problem seems to have fixed itself. Possibly due to the fact that I've changed video drivers from Nouveau to the NVIDIA binary driver.\n", "Q: Can't copy PPA package to another series: \"same version already building\" I have a PPA with a package built for Precise, which I want to also have available for Trusty. I've read that is as simple as using the \"copy packages\" feature in Launchpad. When I do so, I get the message:\nCopying failed of <package> (<version>)   Remove notification\nCopied from: <ppa name>. Target series: Trusty\n<package> <version> in precise (same version already building in the destination archive for Precise)\n\nit sounds like it failed to copy to \"Trust\" because it is already in \"Precise\" - which seems stupid.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it's not that simple.\nThere's a requirement that there cannot be the same version of a package but with different contents in a given archive. What this means is that you can't tell Launchpad to rebuild a package for Trusty when it's built for Precise (in your own PPA), because the version is the same, but the final deb packages will be different (your entire PPA is considered one archive). This is more of a limitation of the Debian/Ubuntu repo format than anything else.\nYou can either copy the binaries as is (which I personally don't recommend, due to the large difference in library versions) or upload the package with different version numbers for each release. Appending something like ~trusty1 will work. See my PPA for an example.\n", "Q: After some weird flash out, I can't login to wmii any more, how to fix it? I've been using wmii on Ubuntu14.04(virtual machine on win7) for months.\nI got popped out to the login interface several times due to some wired mouse click action.\nBut today this happened, I couldn't login to wmii any more. I'm stuck at the interface like \n\nThe bottom yellow bar is the command area for wmii. but it has no response when I press Mod + p\nI restart my machine, and even reinstalled wmii, but every time I tried to log in to wmii, I'm stuck at that interface. By the way, I login to wmii from the login interface, where I can choose between Gnome and wmii. I can login to gnome normally\nHow to fix this? \n\nA: Problem solved, the problem was caused by some extra resize configuration which I copied from internet to enable keyboard resize. \nAfter deleting these configurations, I can log into wmii again.\nBe aware that reinstalling wmii won't refresh your local wmii config, which is under $HOME/.wmii/\nSo if you encounter a similar problem, check your wmiirc and recover its original status.\n", "Q: Auto-Mount web server with SSHFS Okay, I'm running out of ideas here. Because of the password authentication with SSHFS and because SSH keys do not seem to be supported on the web server, I am simply looking for a script I can run @reboot with the crontab.\nI tried this python script here (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=135113) but it just doesn't seem to work. Note that while security is a priority, I am running out of ideas and storing the password as human-readable does not concern me right now. My data server requires a 24hr reboot, and auto-mounting afterwards is a must.\nFor the purposes of simplicity, lets say my information is as follows:\nRemote Server: server.com\nRemote User: USER\nRemote Location: /home/USER/USER.server.com\nLocal Mount Point: /home/USER/webfolder\n\nA: if you use ssh with ssh-key  then you just have to add  your identity to authorized_keys on your server.  more here\nafter you have done this you can just use sshfs in any cron job without any password\n", "Q: Bash searches for inexistent directories upon opening terminal I tried to install IRAF a couple weeks ago but I couldn't get it to work so I ended up uninstalling the whole thing.

You probably also need to do a rm -r /home/ani/.iraf/ to remove the hidden directory iraf. If you only do this the commands in those 3 files will skip the sourcing of the setup file.

In the Ubuntu Software Center search for OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime (openjdk-7-jre) and install it. There is also a developer version of Java in the Ubuntu Software Center, but you probably don't need it.\nInstalling OpenJDK is not enough for enabling Java in web browsers. You'll also need to install the icedtea-7-plugin package. However under normal conditions, it is not at all necessary to enable Java in web browsers, and if you don't install it you'll probably find that you don't need it either.\n", "Q: Why does 14.04 say there are no updates, when there are? Why does Update Manager in 14.04 currently say it's up-to-date when apt-get upgrade shows there are updates to install?\n\n\nA: That's probably due to the phased updates.\nNew updates may introduce new bugs.\nSo, to minimize the impact of those bugs, the updates are released gradually to more users.\nThis only affects the Update Manager, not apt-get.\nIf you run the Update Manager tomorrow, it will probably show some of those updates that apt-get is reporting now.\nIn short, I think it's normal.\nEDIT: Yes, it's due to that.

Just make sure boot from USB is enabled and ordered above any other media that have an OS on it (e.g. if you had another OS installed already on the hard drive, make sure USB has priority over the hard drive).\n", "Q: Install Python 2.7.8 on Ubuntu 12.04 I have to use Ubuntu 12.04 for some reason.

I want to do a clean install of Ubuntu and then create an image that I can use to restore the system to a clean state after I've tested the installation and use of an app within Ubuntu. \nBut all I'm finding is cloning, which doesn't do what I want. I don't want to clone my drive. I want to be able to run a test and then restore from an image so that everything is exactly as it was before I started the test. \nBasically this is what I need to do:\nInstall Ubuntu 12.04. \nCreate an image of 12.04 that I store somewhere else. \nReformat the drive and install 14.04. \nCreate an image of 14.04 that I store somewhere else. \nErase the hard disk and restore the 12.04 image. \nInstall the application I'm testing to find issues. \nErase the hard disk and restore the 12.04 image. \nReinstall the application I'm testing to find issues during other install options. \nErase the hard disk and restore the 12.04 image. \nReinstall the application I'm testing to find issues that may arise from different application configurations. \nAnd repeat. \nAnd repeat. \nAnd repeat. \nFrom what I'm reading, cloning is primarily for servers to allow you to have a copy of the disk you're using in the event of a failure. When it does fail, you switch to the clone to keep the server running while you're repairing the disk. \nI want imaging because I need every starting state for each test to be identical to every other starting state so that I can figure out where problems are. If anything at all is different between the install of Ubuntu I start with during one test and the install of Ubuntu I start with during another, the test is invalid. \n\nA: I've used RedoBackup, and it does just that.  I have tested it with 14.04, and it works OK. \nUsing it, will restore everything back to the exact same condition prior to doing the image.  And the beauty about it that you don't have to install it, you can either use a Live CD or USB.\n\nA: You're vague about this \"app\" you want to test, so there could be several options.\nOne I can think of is for you to use a virtual machine to do your tests. Create a VM for 12.04 and another for 14.04. Install Ubuntu on those. Once finished, create a \"snapshot\" of each VM. Install your app and do your tests. When you need to \"roll back\" to the initial state, just restore the snapshot. This is very disk-efficient because snapshots only store the changes on top of the base image.\nYou can use VirtualBox for this (http://www.howtogeek.com/150258/how-to-save-time-by-using-snapshots-in-virtualbox/) or Qemu/KVM (http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/CreateSnapshot and http://kashyapc.com/2012/09/14/externaland-live-snapshots-with-libvirt/, the latter has some Fedora-specific commands but the main utility, virsh, is available in Ubuntu).\nAnother more lightweight technique is using an LXC container. It also allows creating a \"base\" image and \"cloning\" it using an incremental backingstore (-B overlayfs when running lxc-clone). Once the tests are finished the clone can just be deleted. Or you could use an ephemeral container, which is again a clone but it stores the changes in memory and self-destroys when stopped. See https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxc.html#lxc-cloning and https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/27/lxc-1-0-container-storage/. LXC containers are not entirely identical to a full-blown virtual machine, so they may or may not suit your purpose. I can't really tell without more information about your app.\n", "Q: Remote rsnapshot failing with \"Permission denied\" error I'm trying to set up remote backups with rsnapshot from my home server. I want my server to connect into my laptop and take backups over SSH.Everything is set up correctly and I can connect from my server to the laptop perfectly. \nThe problem is I'm getting a permission error when I run sudo rsnapshot -v hourly (from the server):\n...\nrsync: opendir \"/foo/bar\" failed: Permission denied (13)\n...\n\nI've created a separate backup user on my laptop and I'm connecting over ssh with this user. This is my ~/.ssh/config that rsnapshot is making use of:\nHost macbookpro\n    HostName macbookpro\n    PreferredAuthentications publickey\n    User backup\n    Identity File ~/.ssh/keys/macbookpro.id_rsa\n\nI've also added the following to my sudoers file on my laptop which should allow rsync to run as root when called remotely by rsnapshot: \nbackup  ALL=(root)      NOPASSWD:       /usr/bin/rsync\n\nyet whenever I run rsnapshot I continue to get permission errors. Does anyone see what's wrong? \n\nA: Ok, looks like I figured it out. Poking around on my laptop, I tried to run the rsync command (that rsnapshot would normally invoke over ssh) manually as the backup user and noticed I was getting permission errors locally as well.\nIt seems that even if you have the entry in your sudoers file to explicitly allow a user run a certain binary without a password, you still need to actually preface your command with sudo. (I'm on a macbook so I'm not sure if this is particular to OSX)\nThere didn't seem to be a good way to do this in rsnapshot.conf so I followed the instructions in this tutorial\nI made a file on my laptop called rsync_sudo.sh and added the following: \n/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/rsync \"$@\";\n\nthen symlinked it to /usr/bin/ and back on my server I added the following to /etc/rsnapshot.conf:\nrsync_long_args         --rsync-path=rsync_sudo.sh --delete --numeric-ids --relative --delete-excluded\n\nand now everything seems to be working\n", "Q: What's the purpose of the Ubuntu Online Accounts extension in Firefox? On my Ubuntu 14.04, there is a Firefox extension \"Ubuntu Online Accounts 0.5\", installed by the package xul-ext-webaccounts (which is in the default install).\nWhat is the purpose of this extension? What will stop working if I disable it?\nThere seems to be no documentation in the package, the description page of the extension is basically empty, and the only link points to https://launchpad.net/webaccounts-browser-extension, on which I also cannot find information on its purpose.\nOf course I suspect it is related to the Online Accounts dialog in the System Control Center, however Firefox is not listed as an application in that dialog, and when I visit a page such as Twitter with Firefox for which I have an account set up under Online Accounts, nothing happens.\n\nA: Ok, so I decided to investigate in the source code. The extension itself consists only of a few lines of Javascript in the file /usr/lib/xul-ext/webaccounts/content/browser.js that only loads the library /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/webaccounts-browser-extension/libwebaccounts.so and calls it with info about the currently visited page.\nThe package webaccounts-extension-common that contains this library also has a file /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.webcredentials.capture.gschema.xml that contains the gsettings configuration options of this package. There is only a single one, which lists the sites for which the extension was already active once and won't ask again. In my case, it contained twitter.com, which is why I did not notice anything when visiting Twitter. This blacklist can be cleared with the following command:\ngsettings reset com.canonical.webcredentials.capture dontask-accounts\n\nThe next time I visited Twitter, the Ubuntu Control Center opened with the Online Accounts dialog, so that is the desired effect of this plugin.\nHowever, the source code of the library shows that there should be more. It contains a function webaccounts_store_login that has the purpose of automatically adding the Twitter/etc. account you just used in the browser to the Ubuntu Online Accounts, such that the desktop integration just works immediately after you used the site once in the browser. This is of course a nice integration. However, this does not work for me (no account is added, only the accounts window opens), and there is a two-year old bug report that indicates that this is the same for others as well.\n\nA: Packages like that installed by Firefox are designed to provide extra functionality, some of which isn't noticeable.

I have successfully installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, also 64-bits. To do so,I followed this tutorial whenever possible. I only failed on the disable secure boot part: there is no 'Secure-boot' or even UEFI mention in my BIOS!\nScreenshots from other BIOS of the same model show the option under Boot, but in mine there is absolutely none. Because of this, I cannot boot into Ubuntu. The computer loads straight into Windows. \nI tried running boot repair, but got an error (i can show the log, but it's pretty long).\nDoes anyone know how to fix this issue?\nUPDATE\nI reinstalled Ubuntu. Same problem, goes straight to Window. Boot-Repair informs me that i am using Windows in Legacy mode. It excecuted with no errors this time, but after restarting GRUB was still missing. I can't turn off Secure Boot yet.\nUPDATE\nI tried using Boot Repair to install grub on a bios-grub 1mb partition. Still boots straight to windows. I feel like punching something\nUPDATE\nI reinstalled Ubuntu with a bios-grub partition again, no luck. I forgot to add, there is also no Ubuntu boot option in the BIOS. Even though the OS is installed, I simply cannot access it. \nI'm becoming very worried about this, I need Ubuntu for college, does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this??\n\nA: I have had the same problem and you can make a virtual drive whit an virtualmachine VM whit windows 8 whir pre installed ubuntu, and then run boot-repair.\nand it might work fine this way.\n\nA: I have this exact ultrabook (Asus K46CB) and have managed to dual boot by doing so:\nGo to Settings - Update and Recovery - Recovery.

(In contrast, I can reproduce the behavior you're seeing by attempting to install the similarly named nonexistent package q++.)\nThere are two likely causes of apt-get not knowing about the g++  package:\n\n*\n\n*No software source providing g++ package is configured to be used.\n\n*A software source providing g++ is configured to be used but the information about what packages are available for installation hasn't been updated since then.\n\nIf it were the second reason, you could just run sudo apt-get update. But I think it's more likely the first one.\nMake sure main is enabled.\ng++ is provided in the main repository component. This should pretty much always be enabled, but perhaps it is not.\nMany of the packages necessary for a working Ubuntu system are provided by the main component (this is the software maintained directly by Canonical rather than by the larger community, and it consists mostly of core software important to many Ubuntu systems). Furthermore, some of the packages apt-get listed as installed, such as python-gconf, are in main.\nSo I think what happened was that main got disabled recently, probably by accident. apt-get knows about software from main that is currently installed because it can see that it's installed. But if main is disabled, apt-get doesn't know about any software from main that you don't have.\nTo check if main is enabled, and re-enable it if it's not, open Software & Updates (called Software Sources on previous versions of Ubuntu). One way to open this is to click the Settings... button in the Software Updater (called the Update Manager in old versions of Ubuntu).\nThen make sure the box labeled \"Canonical-supported free and open-source software (main)\" is checked.\n\nIf it already was, then most likely I have guessed wrong about the cause of your problem. If it was not already checked, check the box (you may need to enter your password) and click Close. You'll be told \"The information about available software is out of date\"; click the Reload button.\n\n\n*\n\n*If this is an Ubuntu Server installation or other system without a GUI, see Kangarooo's answer to How do I enable the \"Universe\" repository? (just enable main instead of universe).\n\nThen try installing g++ again.\nTry a different APT mirror.\nIf the main component was already enabled, maybe there's something wrong with the APT mirror you're using. Especially if you're not using one of the official mirrors (us.archive.ubuntu.com, with us replaced with your \"country code\"), I recommend trying a different mirror, an official one if possible.\nYou can set your APT mirror in Software & Updates as well. Just change it in the drop-down menu labeled \"Download from\".\n\nAs when enabling a software source, when you quit Software & Updates after changing your download server, you'll be prompted that software information is out of date and you should click Reload. Then see if g++ can be installed.\n\n*\n\n*If this is an Ubuntu Server installation or other system without a GUI, see How do I change mirrors in Ubuntu Server from regional to main?\nFurther troubleshooting.\nIf it still can't be installed, then you should edit your question with more information to help troubleshoot the problem.\n\n*\n\n*Provide the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list. One way to do this is to copy the complete output of the command cat /etc/apt/sources.list and paste it into your question. Select it and press Ctrl+K to format it properly.\n\n*Optionally, you might want to see if you can find and install the g++  package in the Software Center. If you can, great!

This means than you won't be able to run that CD.\n\n\n*Most likely, you do not need to run the installation CD in order to use the monitor.  When I buy a monitor, I throw the installation CD directly into the garbage without opening it - regardless of the OS I use.\n\n\n*With Linux, you don't typically install drivers that came bundled on the CD of a piece of hardware.  Linux itself already contains support for thousands upon thousands of pieces of hardware without the need to install any drivers (in this sense it has an advantage over Windows - when it works).  The general philosophy with the Linux kernel is that it should support as much existing hardware as possible without the need for extra drivers.  When you do need to install extra drivers, often you'll be able to get them through Ubuntu-specific means rather than from the original manufacturer of the hardware.  A Google search (eg for ubuntu model-name-of-hardware) will also often be helpful.\nThat said, for a monitor you don't usually need to run the installer, regardless of whether you're running Linux or Windows.  Those installers don't usually install a driver as such (although it could be a \"driver\" that consists mainly of a color profile), just some software you probably won't use.\n\nA: The problem is with the j5create VGA to USB adapter\nIt looks like this needs a driver and there is no driver for it.

I've looked all over and can't find any reason as to why or how Nvidia names their drivers. For example they have a 330.xxx/340.xxx series that are current but also a 300.xxx series. I've also found that they aren't always released in order by number.\nHere's an example from their site showing versions and release date:\n\n\n*\n\n*331.38 - January 13\n\n*334.16 - Feb 7\n\n*331.49 - Feb 18\n\n\nI'm really confused about what driver to actually go with. A few different series versions seem to work adequately. I want to have an understanding of the differences between the versions and what the best option would be. I really appreciate any information.\n\nA: The choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have a version 304.117 named as NVidia binary X.Org driver ('current' driver) in the Ubuntu Software Center. I'd say - use it if you can get it to run, it is likely to stay where you put it.\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa - this may well work, but also break at times. e.g. it broke on 2014-07-10 for me as there was some kind of change in the development build - This is what is currently worked on for Ubuntu.\n\n*What you download at nvidia.com - likely to be the very latest there is for nvidia GPU's. But also likely to break at updates, if the updates involve changing things that the driver depends on. Just make sure you check that the driver is for your hardware.\n\n*The 'Noveau' driver - cannot comment thoroughly / seems to get in the way for the above.\n\nA: I agree that Nvidia driver versions are confusing, since 4xx Nvidia have introduced the concept of Long Lived, Short Lived and Beta branches, hopefully this will help make things a bit clearer.\nThere are a few rules of thumb that can help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Major version numbers are branches (eg 430.x is the 430 branch).\n\n*Branches with higher numbers are newer (435 is newer than 430).\n\n*A number of different branches may be getting updates concurrently (at the time of writing both the 430 and 435 branches are being updated).\n\n*Some branches are Long Lived (430) and some branches are Short Lived (435) .\n\n*Long Lived branches will get updates for a longer period than Short Lived branches (this is similar to how LTS vs non LTS Ubuntu releases work).\n\n*Long Lived and Short Lived are not a measure of stability they are a measure of how long the branch will receive updates.\n\n\nGiven the list above you can see that it makes sense to think about Nvidia driver versions like you think about Ubuntu LTS versions. Some people choose to stick with Long Lived (LTS) branches so that they don't need to be upgrading all the time (and possibly they are more stable?). Other people want the latest and greatest so they install the latest Short Lived branch, this is like running an Ubuntu interim release.\nLike with Ubuntu LTS releases sometimes the Long Lived branch is the latest branch available.\nWhen it comes to release cadence things are not as clear. I am not sure if there is a fixed number of Short Lived branches between a Long Lived branch or not. I also don't know if there is a regular release cadence.\nThis nvidia devtalk forum post suggests the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a new branch every 3 months\n\n*Releases alternate between Long Lived and Short Lived branches\n\n*Short Lived branches are supported for 3 months\n\n*Long Lived branches are supported for 6 months\n\n\nI have not seen this actually confirmed by Nvidia themselves though.\nIn terms of branch numbering it looks like Long Lived branch use even numbers while Short Lived branches use odd numbers.\nYou can find the latest releases listed on this page: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/. You can find the historical list of releases and release dates here: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/linux-amd64-display-archive/. \nThe following links provide more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Devtalk - What does the short/long lived branch mean?\n\n*Devtalk - What are the different driver versions?

To install from a Live USB/DVD use these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an ISO from this page (64 bit or 32 bit depending on your flavor)\n\n*Download a ISO burning program I recommend UNetbootin or Rufus.

These methods work well.\n\n*Restart your computer and enter the BIOS by pressing the \"System Setup\" (or something along those lines) key. It is usually [DEL], [F2], or [F12] but it will say on your screen as your computer boots.\n\n*Under the \"BOOT\" section, change the boot order of your PC to prioritize your USB/DVD. Ensure that fast boot is turned off. If you can't find anything that talks about it, then it is already turned off. Exit the BIOS saving changes.\n\n*You will now boot onto your USB/DVD. Follow onscreen instructions from their. Should you wish to erase everything and install only Ubuntu select that option.

If it is you've got two options - either you can disable it (after making the hostname changes as above):\n sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled\n\nOr you can create a new user-data file and reload the config - see the cloud-init docs for details.\n\nA: Many virtual machine hosts will overwrite your /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts file upon every reboot to whatever is configured within their customer control panel.\nIf you can, configure your desired hostname within your VPS host's control panel.\nAn alternative option that many people use - despite being a bit of a hack - is to mark these files as immutable meaning that they are truly read-only (even by root).\nThis is a file attribute.  Linux filesystems allow many file attributes, but they are rarely used.  You modify them with the chattr command (short for \"change attributes\" - as opposed to chmod to change permissions or chown to change ownership).\nTo set a file as immutable:\nchattr +i filename\n\nTo clear the immutable flag:\nchattr -i filename\n\nThis approach is known to work on OpenVZ platforms, which are the platforms in which the /etc/hosts rewriting issue is most likely to occur.  If you have machine level virtualisation like Xen or KVM/Qemu, it's less likely to work.\n\nA: I tested right now I this is what I did apart from following your steps:\nsudo nano /etc/hostname\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nI changed my host from cyrex to cyrex2k and rebooted and got:\ncyrex@cyrex2k:~$ hostname\ncyrex2k\ncyrex@cyrex2k:~$ \n\ncyrex@cyrex2k:~$ cat /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1   cyrex2k\n\nSo my recommendation is to check to see if the IP is validated against the domain name, just in case and also add what virtual environment you are using. I have had problems with VMware like this, so I moved to VirtualBox and QEMU (With KVM).\n", "Q: overscan with noveau display driver I'm using opensource driver there is an overscan, my hdtv/monitor res.1920x1080 24\" how can I configure the screen, if need more details let me know (edges of the picture are lost ubuntu 14.04 LTS nvidia gtx550ti graphic card\n\nA: Overscan is a function of the monitor - you should be turning this off on the monitor, not on the PC.\nGraphics drivers do sometimes have facilities to correct for overscan in the monitor but these are intended only for monitors where it's impossible to disable overscan, which is basically CRT monitors.  On digital flat panels (LCD etc) you will get a much poorer (blurry) display quality if you do this because the image will have been re-sized twice - once by the graphics card and once by the monitor.  Instead, you should output full-frame from the graphics card and disable overscan on the monitor.\nOn most monitors this \"just works\" because signal hints it receives over HDMI tell it that the signal is coming from a PC, and from this the monitor can infer that it shouldn't use overscan.  In some monitors (particularly those designed as televisions) it may be a manual option in the monitor settings however.\nSome monitors may refer to this as enable/disable overscan, but at least one some (including my Samsung TV) the no-overscan mode is referred to as \"screen fit\".\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS login loop I'm asking this because initially, my problem was a power failure during installation\nso I typed the following instructions in the maintenance shell:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\n sudo dpkg --configure a\n sudo mount -o remount,ro /\n sudo sync\n sudo reboot \n\nThe first three lines worked, afterwards, my computer (a Dell Inspiron 530) got stalled \nfor several hours, so I unplugged it.

Which is the preferred way to install the latest stable version of Mesa on Ubuntu? I believe that would be a PPA, but not the bleeding-edge one like xorg-edgers.\nI would like to see a PPA that contains the latest stable release. Right now 10.3 has reached Release Candidate stage and development branched to 10.4, so the latest stable version is 10.2.

If you are on Kisak PPA, then remove it using:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:kisak/kisak-mesa\n\nIf you have used Padoka Stable PPA, then remove it using:\nsudo ppa-purge paulo-miguel-dias/pkppa\n\notherwise you might risk breaking the graphics driver in the next release. While that definitely is possible to recover from, it is huge and cumbersome task for even an experienced Linux power user.\nEarlier\nPreviously I instructed people to use Padoka Stable Mesa, however, that PPA hasn't seen much activity for a long time now.\nIf you are on that PPA, I advise you to remove that by running:\nsudo ppa-purge paulo-miguel-dias/pkppa\n\nAfter that you should be able to install the Kisak PPA using the steps above.

I've been stuck here for several hours now, having failed to find a solution via Google.\n\nA: If you're trying to install Windows on the same drive you have already installed Ubuntu, keep in mind that you probably wont be able to dual-boot without making some changes to grub (or whatever boot manager you are using to boot Ubuntu). To avoid that I recommend installing first Windows and the Ubuntu (newer versiones detected the installed OSs and provide you with all the options you need to create the correct boot options). \nBut, if you just want to create an usb windows installer, maybe this a duplicate question\n", "Q: Why do PDFs with forms create black bars on some pages? I am using Ubuntu 14.04. I've been working with PDFs with forms, and recently I've had some issues with a set of character sheets for D&D; they come with forms so that you can save your character digitally, but when I use any of the document viewers, I get these horrible black bars in the places where the forms are supposed to be on half the pages.\nThe weird part of it is that if I open the file in Google Chrome, I don't get these black bars in these spots.\nI've never had this problem before, and going through the other form-fill-able PDFs I have, none of them have the same issue. From that and the fact that this does not show up in Chrome, it likely has something to do with the Ubuntu PDF viewers and these files in particular.\nThe PDF viewed in Ocular PDF Viewer.\n\nThe PDF viewed in Evince Document Viewer.\nThis one is installed with Ubuntu 14.04, and on the side you can see the first page doesn't have the black bars.\n\nI exported the PDF to GIMP and saved the second page as a PNG, the black bars appeared in the editor.\n\nThe PDF viewed in Google Chrome, the black bars don't appear here, indicating that it's likely a problem with Ubuntu.\n\nHere is an imgur album of all the above images. In order, it shows the PDF open in Ocular, then Evince, then a PNG of the pdf exported to GIMP, and then Google Chrome.\nWhy do PDFs with forms create black bars on some pages? And, how do I get rid of them?\nEdit: I recently got a Linux Mint live disk, and if I open the files with Evince in Mint, the same black bars show up. This means the problem has something to do with either the internal components of the document readers, or with Linux itself. I may burn some more live disks of other Linux distributions and see if any of them have the same problems. \n\nA: The only viable solution I've found so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upload PDF file with wrong fields to https://www.pdfescape.com\n\n*Fill in any field, without at least one change to the fields, the uploaded file will be returned directly as is rather than recreated properly at point 3.\n\n*Click on 'Save & Download PDF...' and download it onto your computer\n\n\nThe black form fields should now look normal. Whatever is wrong with them, rewriting the file completely with PDFescape seems to fix it.\nWho knows what's wrong with them. Maybe Wizards of the Coast use some outdated Windows-only writer or something. Though strange that only the 'Character details' & 'Spellcasting sheet' pages are rendered wrongly...\n", "Q: How to set USB flash drive as first boot device in dell inspiron 15 i m trying to install ubuntu on Dell Inspiron 15 using USB flash drive using USSB installer. But in booting sequence there are only two boot options. Legacy boot and UEFI boot mode. Can anyone tell me that how can i set the first boot device = USB flash drive.???\n\nA: You need to reformat the USB and put Ubuntu on it. When booting, you'll have to press a certain key to bring up the BIOS. There should be a menu that allows you to change boot order. \n\nA: Check whether the USB Boot option is not forbidden in BIOS menu. Enter it in the menu with pressing F2.\n", "Q: Problems after installing Ubuntu 14.04 on previous Windows 7 I had Windows 7 on my Sony Vaio E series laptop. Yesterday I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on it. Now when I start my system, the internal hard disk (seagate 500 GB) is making an intense sound of clicking, and the system stops sometimes as well.\nMy laptop is 4 years old.\n\nA: I'd say bad luck. It's very unlikely that a hard disc failure -- your issue sounds like you should buy a new one -- is caused by installation of Ubuntu. Do your backup and buy a new one. Also you might try to boot the live image of Ubuntu and maybe run smartctl for you disc. \n", "Q: Maximum Duration for dual boot (8.1 and 14.04) I have just bought a Lenovo i7 Laptop with 500 GB hard I have installed Windows 8.1 on Partition#1 of 360 GB and the remaining 95 GB is Empty I want to install Ubuntu 14.04. how long will it operate successfully and is 95 GB good to go (if I install latest java IDE). \nAnd what if I format Partition#1 after installing 14.04 will Ubuntu stay there with out any affect.  \n\nA: \nhow long will it operate successfully \n\nWell.. technically Ubuntu 14.04 will be supported until April 2019. So if you do not mess it up yourself you can stick with 14.04 for a few years ;) \n\nand is 95 GB good to go\n\nMore than enough. You can run Ubuntu comfortably with 25Gb. The Ubuntu base system itself needs about 10Gb to work without running out of space. \n\nif I install latest java IDE\n\nThat is not going to cost you Gb's so you should be fine.\n\nAnd what if I format Partition#1 after installing 14.04 will Ubuntu stay there with out any affect. \n\nYes. If Ubuntu is installed elsewhere (ie. not on P#1) it will remain there.  1 thing though: if you delete the bootmanager (grub) you will need to re-install it for it to show all the operating systems again. \n", "Q: How to switch remotely from Ubuntu and Windows 7 and vice versa? How do I switch from Ubuntu and Windows 7 (and vice versa) while working remotely?\nActually, I'm using the Windows loader (BCD) on MBR, and I have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)\n\n\nIf I'm working on Windows 7 and want to boot to Ubuntu, it's easy, because I set Ubuntu as default. So at restart, the system goes directly to GRUB (with timeout sets to \"0\") and Ubuntu is there.\nBut how could I get back to Windows again? Is there a chance?\nWhile typing I was wondering if I could solve this trouble forcing the Windows loader to Ubuntu and let GRUB2 to choose from different systems.\nCould it work?\n\nA: Good that you already solved the part of switching from Windows to Linux.\nThe other direction is not that hard:\n\nThere is the command grub-reboot that does just what you need - see below for detais:\nIf your grub menu entry for the system you want to boot is \"Windows\", you would just do:\n$ grub-reboot Windows\n\nIf you configure the hardware to boot after a power failure, I see no reason the computer could not just stay running. \nBut if not, it should be possible to wake it up with wake on lan (WOL), booting the system you configured before shutdown. \nThe WOL works with \"special\" network packages that can not be routed outside the local network, so there is a device needed in that network, like a some DSL router or any computer.\n\n\nFrom man 8 grub-reboot:\n GRUB-REBOOT(8)     System Administration Utilities      GRUB-REBOOT(8)\n\n\n NAME\n        grub-reboot - set the default boot entry for GRUB, for the next\n        boot only\n\n SYNOPSIS\n        grub-reboot [OPTION] MENU_ENTRY\n\n DESCRIPTION\n        Set the default boot menu entry for GRUB,  for  the  next  boot\n        only.\n\n        [  ...  ]\n        --boot-directory=DIR\n               expect  GRUB images under the directory DIR/grub instead\n               of the /boot/grub directory\n\n        MENU_ENTRY is a number, a menu item title or a menu item  iden‐\n        tifier.

How do I transfer public and private PGP Keys to a Mac OS X Lion machine?\n\nA: Assuming that you are using GnuPG on Ubuntu...\nFirst, you should export them:\ngpg --export-secret-keys <keyid>  >key.gpg\ngpg --export <keyid>  >>key.gpg\n\nThen you should transfer this file to the Mac via a secure channel and import the keys on the recipient. You should be able to import the key via the graphical GPG Keychain, or through the command line (gpg --import key.gpg).\nIf you need to use a insecure channel to transfer the private key, such as email or other network based channels (where you don't have proper certificates ensuring that you are really communicating with the correct machine), you must use PGP (or some other method) to keep you private key secure:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, create a temporary key pair send the public part to your Ubuntu machine\n\n*On your Ubuntu, check the fingerprint of the received key and encrypt 'key.gpg' with it, also signing it with you own key\n\n*Send both the Ubuntu public key and the encrypted 'key.gpg.gpg' file to the Mac\n\n*Again on your Mac, check the fingerprint of the received key and decrypt/verify the received 'key.gpg.gpg' file\n\n\nA: Here's what I use for blindly transferring all of my GnuPG keys and keyring.

So I need to move them into another folder, process them and delete them. For this I tried using \n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f |head -1000|xargs cp -t $destdir\n\nIt gives error on single and double quotes in filename. There are thousands of files and I have no idea how many of them has these quotes in them.\nCan anyone help me find a solution?\nAnd I tried with the -0 option, it did not work\n\nA: Use the -print0 option, then use this method to apply head on it:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0 | tr '\\0\\n' \\n\\0' | \n    head -1000 | tr '\\0\\n' \\n\\0' | xargs --null cp -t $destdir\n\nNote that xargs has a -L option, which specifies how many arguments it should read at once from the input. Thus, depending on the processing you have to do, you could skip the head, write a script which takes a 1000 arguments, or even do the processing via xargs directly.\n\nA: This should solve the stated problem:\nshopt -s globstar\nprintf '%q\\0' **/*.pdf | xargs -0 -L 1000 cp -t $destdir\n\nThe first line enables the globstar option for bash, so that ** gives you a recursive search. Since printf is a bash builtin on Ubuntu, it should have no problems with large numbers of files.\nThe first argument given to printf tells it how to format all the other arguments. %q tells it to escape everything that might cause trouble with a \\ -- so foo bar'baz will become foo\\ bar\\'baz. The \\0 tells it to insert a null character after each quoted string (equivalent to using -print0 in find), which can then be picked apart by xargs's -0 option. If you need to use newline-delimited names -- which, I think, you do, since you'll need a combination of head and tail to do batches of files -- then you should use \\n instead of \\0:\nprintf '%q\\n' **/*.pdf | head -1000 | xargs cp -t $destdir\n\n\nWith all that said, you might be better off calling you script directly from find -- then you don't have to worry about escaping or quoting anything:\nfind . -type f -exec your_script '{}' \\+\n\n", "Q: Updated to 14.04 and now my basic terminal commands such as \"ls\" dont work?

169.254.x.y address is a dummy address that tells us the interface requested an address from the access point but was not given one.\nI suggest you use either Wicd or manual methods (/etc/network/interfaces) but not both.\nSecond, your interfaces file has both eth0 and wlan0 starting automatically. I doubt that you want or need both. Assuming you use wireless the most, I'd comment out the 'auto eth0' line. If you wish to use ethernet, stop wireless and start ethernet:\nsudo ifdown wlan0 && sudo ifup eth0\n\nNext, the interfaces file expects that wpa-psk is going to be the WPA2 password in clear text.

But it could also be that there are delays on the youtube side, that add up.\nThat it just the time it takes to download the HTML that is needed;\nThe command needs to make at least two HTTP requests, one after another, and probably more.  \nSo if anything is slow, it's multiplied by the number of requests already.\nFor me it takes 1.5 seconds on a very fast line - that is not that far from 8 seconds.\n\nHow to find out\nI'll show the commands I used to find out:\nTo make the examples more tidy, we use a variable for the URL:\n$ u=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4JGSAmu4lg\"\n\nWe want to measure the duration of commands; Using the command time needs to take care not to mix up the command and the shell builtin. We use a small function to make the lines shorter:\n$ t(){/usr/bin/time -f 'Time: %es' \"$@\";}\n\nYour command writes out the URL of the video file (truncated to 80 columns):\n$ youtube-dl -g \"$u\"\nhttps://r20---sn-cxg7en7d.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?signature=091F68E823\n\nLet's measure the time it takes to run on my computer:\n$ t youtube-dl -g \"$u\"\nhttps://r20---sn-cxg7en7d.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?signature=091F68E823\nTime: 1.44s\n\nOk, one and a half seconds. Faster than in the question, but not that much faster.\nBut how is it spending the time? Maybe it does download the video in some hidden way and discards it? The video is 11min in 360p. Just downloading it with no options takes about 13s - ten times longer.\nNeed to take a closer look, with the verbose option -v:\n$ t youtube-dl -v -g \"$u\"\n[debug] System config: []\n[debug] User config: []\n[debug] Command-line args: ['-v', '-g', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4J\n[debug] Encodings: locale 'UTF-8', fs 'UTF-8', out 'UTF-8', pref: 'UTF-8'\n[debug] youtube-dl version 2014.02.06\n[debug] Python version 2.7.6 - Linux-3.13.0-24-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-14\n[debug] Proxy map: {}\nhttps://r20---sn-cxg7en7d.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?sparams=id%2Cinitcwn\nTime: 1.40s\n\nOh, there is some delay before the '[debug]' lines are printed. Looks like youtube-dl spends some time for it's own configuration setup. It's a quarter of a second or so, not the delay we are looking for. But what we can learn from it is that the youtube-dl implementation itself may be slow.\nAfter the messages, nothing happens until the result URL is printed. So we still do not see the interesting part.\nThe option -g is to \"simulate\" the video download in the sense that it does the complicated part of finding out that semi-secret URL, prints it, but then skips the actual download in the end. There is a similar option -s that does not output the URL, and seems similar otherwise. Let's assume it's similar enough if it takes about the same time; We need to check that.\n$ t youtube-dl -v -s \"$u\"\n[debug] System config: []\n[debug] User config: []\n[debug] Command-line args: ['-v', '-s', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4J\n[debug] Encodings: locale 'UTF-8', fs 'UTF-8', out 'UTF-8', pref: 'UTF-8'\n[debug] youtube-dl version 2014.02.06\n[debug] Python version 2.7.6 - Linux-3.13.0-24-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-14\n[debug] Proxy map: {}\n[youtube] Setting language\n[youtube] k4JGSAmu4lg: Downloading webpage\n[youtube] k4JGSAmu4lg: Downloading video info webpage\n[youtube] k4JGSAmu4lg: Extracting video information\nTime: 1.45s\n\nOk, -s takes the same time as -g, so it's ok to replace them for testing.\nMore interesting is that we got more output now. And it's printed with an interesting timing: The lines get printed with a similar delay to each other, so it seems they are about the actions that are actually taking the time we look for.\nFrom the messages, at least two web pages are downloaded. But we can assume that the word \"page\" will not mean a single HTTP request and a single HTML document.\nWhat did we learn?\nThe main point is, the work of the program does actually take time, it's not waiting for something, or hanging.\nAlso, we see multiple steps taking similar amounts of time. There is not much to calculate, so that's network roundtrips in some way, adding up.\nThat means, the latency of our connection is important only here. The throughput of the connection is just irrelevant.\nIf you would make your internet connection faster so it can transfer data at double speed - that would not help at all.\nBut if you can get better ping times, that will make it much faster.\nIt's not about 'ping' times to your internet service provider, though; The ping time all the way to YouTube it what matters - and may be not possible to change.\nInterestingly, for the next step, downloading a video, the requirements for a fast line are exactly the opposite: latency is not relevant at all, and throughput really matters.\n\nNot tired yet?\nWant still more details to understand what the time is really spend on?\nThe next step would be to trace the HTTP connection; I would suspect that it may show many more roundtrips than two, for redirects for example. You could use wireshark, or a logging HTTP proxy, or strace to just count the system calls for connecting or writing.\nFor today, we have both looked deep enough into the rabbit hole of networking.\n\nA: There might be another reason. youtube-dl is distributed as a zipped Python application. Each time you run it, it extracts it and then runs it.\nYou can manually extract it with the unzip command. Then run __main__.py as you would run youtube-dl. On a low powered computer, like the Pi, that will noticeably boost your performance.\n", "Q: Saitek P380 Gamepad 14.04 64bit I have found a Saitek P380 gamepad and would greately like to use it on my Ubuntu 14.04 64bit computer.

This is much simpler than configuring an OpenVPN especially if you don't have privileges on the remote machine.\nFor creating the hotspot on Ubuntu I recommend http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/09/3-ways-create-wifi-hotspot-ubuntu/ which uses the built-in default network-manager.\nWith redsocks installed and configured one can use iptables to redirect all traffic from the wifi hotspot to redsocks which then passes it through the socks proxy.\nFor instance if your wifi hotspot is on the 10.42.0.1/24 subnet and the incoming redsocks port is 12345 issue:\nsudo iptables -F\nsudo iptables -t nat -F\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 10.42.0.0/24 -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345\n\nFor a detailed set of instructions visit http://abidmujtaba.blogspot.com/2016/07/ubuntu-create-wifi-hotspot-access-point.html\n", "Q: Unable to connect Internet to Xubuntu 14.04 with wired connection Just installed Xubuntu 14.04 from usb, installed okay except that I cannot connect to internet.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm connected via a Solwise Homeplug (Ethernet over wiring).\n\n*Xubuntu says I have 'Wired connection 1' but 'Ethernet Network' is greyed out\n\n*ipconfig lists a section for 'etho' and 'lo'\n\n*I have a Mac and a PC connected to the same homeplug and their internet connection is fine\n\n*During installation it also complained I have no internet access.\n\n\nPreviously I was running Xubuntu 12.10 and that was working fine until yesterday when it also lost internet connection and then wouldn't start after reboot.

So dropbox's own encryption would only involve what's sent over the network and/or stored on their servers.\nIn the case of Ubuntu using home directory encryption, per-user data for virtually all apps will be stored within the user's home directory and benefit from the same encryption.\nThat is, it will not be any more secure than the existing home directory encryption that Ubuntu uses.\n\nA: Files are only encrypted on the disk that has encryption. Encryption is a file system feature. Copy a file over to a non-encrypted system the file is not encrypted. \n\nare stored in other clouds, are they encrypted?\n\nOnly if the cloud itself is encrypted.

Sigh. This is similar to HDCP where the video is encrypted and only an approved device (yes, it's Microsoft based) can display it, despite the fact, YouTube does not own any copyright and violates basic free use laws. In other words, the downloaded video will appear corrupted once downloaded. There might be \"decryptors\" in the future, but unlike DVD and Blu-ray players, new keys can be created and removed often enough to make it difficult to keep up.\nVideo download helper and other applications might still work with older videos on the server, but slowly scripts will be added to all videos in the database.

If it does not work for some reason, try it again except using the \"grub-efi\" package when reinstalling GRUB.\nIf your system STILL will not boot, check to ensure that your motherboard/system supports EFI booting. If it supports only a standard BIOS (i.e. NO UEFI or EFI booting), you will need to move your system partition off of your SSD, replace the GPT table on the SSD with a MBR table, then move the partition back onto the SSD and once again try the chroot grub recover method listed in the article above.\nHope this has been helpful.\nMG\n", "Q: YouTube video on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I wanted to download a YouTube video on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

The reason for this is most likely that the dependencies are different in 14.04 (more up-to-date); it is also possible that the package maintainer simply isn't bothering to build packages for older versions of Ubuntu.\nIf you greatly desire to run v0.1.11 on Ubuntu 12.04, you can try downloading and installing the source code.

These are all installed when you install the main package.sudo apt-get remove ... does not automatically free the now-orphaned dependencies that were installed for your package.\nA simple sudo apt-get autoremove should free up the remaining space.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not work like Windows\nIn Windows, a program comes with pretty much all the files it needs.\nIn Ubuntu, a program uses a lot of common files. These are called dependencies. These common files are downloaded once and used by all the programs that need them. (This is one of the reason why Ubuntu does not install all the files in a single folder. It keeps different types of files in a common folder for that type of files so other programs can find them there.)\nYou may have installed some other programs that depend on some of these common files the first program installed as a part of the 64MB download.\nWhen you remove the program, it looks at which other program will continue to need these common files and keeps them in place.\nSometimes this does not work too well, and some orphaned common files are left behind. You can use \nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nto remove those files.\nhope this helps\n\nA: Probably you uninstalled only main program, not other programs which were installed together with your main one, because he is using them.\nYou need to use apt-get together with autoremove command but...\nBe extra careful!\nA few weeks ago, I wanted to uninstall Python2.7 (I had newer version). I did sudo apt-get autoremove python2.7. Didn't know what exactly I'm doing, so wrote \"yes\". And saw, that something is wrong, when i get information \"removing terminal\". I removed half of my Ubuntu system, had to reinstall it.\nSo, be extra careful with autoremove command. I think, just don't use it, unless you really need more free space or you really know what are you doing. You will not lose too much by not using autoremove, just a little disk space, Ubuntu will not be slower. I will not use it anymore unless I will be sure I know what I'm doing.\n", "Q: Why won't my Android SDK Manager show up when invoked from Eclipse? On Ubuntu 12.04, I'm running the Eclipse IDE with the standalone Android SDK plugins installed. I'm using it this way instead of using the ADT Bundle because I'm also using Eclipse for other code.\nIf I try to invoke the Android SDK Manager from the Eclipse Window menu, then I get the happy message about \"SDK Manager will show up shortly...\", but when that status window goes away, the SDK Manager has not, in fact, started.\nI do have a workaround, for now. If I open a terminal window and invoke the tool directly...\n>> /opt/android-sdk-linux/tools/android\n\nThe SDK manager happily opens. No errors are returned. Changes to the Android SDK environment made here persist and function as expected. While this works, it's strange and spooky; I'd rather have it also work within the IDE.\nAs a nicer workaround, I tried constructing a Gnome .desktop file to invoke the executable directly, but when I try to use that, nothing happens, and no errors are visible.\nEven stranger, the Android Virtual Device Manager works just fine when invoked from within Eclipse. Only the SDK Manager is affected by this...whatever it is.\nI have seen elsewhere that the Android tools might require Java 6, but I can't change Eclipse's Java path in eclipse.ini without also clobbering use of Java 7 in the rest of Eclipse, so this doesn't seem like a viable option.\nWhat else can I try, or what am I missing, that would make the SDK Manager behave in Eclipse?\nAnd before I get flagged as a duplicate of the following questions, I've already read them and tried some things without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Android sdk manager not showing up ( Ubuntu )\n\n\n*\n\n*I already installed the official Oracle JDKs and don't want to mess with installing the OpenJDK again and dealing with conflicts, etc.\n\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/questions/386392/problem-in-opening-sdk-manager-in-eclipse\n\n\n*\n\n*All my paths are set correctly, and I don't get any errors when invoking from the terminal.\n\n\n*Android SDK manager not opening\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't get an error message on the terminal.\n\n\n\nA: Welp, just found a solution. Or maybe it's just another workaround. Whatever.\n>> cd /usr/bin/\n>> sudo ln -s /opt/android-sdk-linux/tools/android android\n>> which android\n/usr/bin/android\n\nThe fact that this works suggests that, even if the tools directory is properly within my path, Eclipse can't find it unless it's also in /usr/bin/.

EFGH.IG\nKLM,NOP.QR\nSTU. VWXYZ. 123\n\nThis code logic is quite simple. We read the file character by character (thanks to the -N1 flag. The IFS= is needed to be able to read newlines as well), then we add every valid character we encounter at the begining of the $word variable (thus reversing the word). When we encounter a non-alphanumeric character, we echo the value of $word and reset the value to empty.

If you do, the shell will not be able to find the end of the heredoc.\nWith redirecting to and from files, never do this: command < file > file with the same file. The redirections happen before the command starts, and > will truncate the file to zero length.

As part of learning I just want to remove the Ubuntu Server completely so that I can reinstall the server once again to get a better understanding of the installation process.\nIf I delete the Virtual Machine (By remove option in Hyper - V) I am able to delete the server and the Hard Disc where the server is installed.\nBut using this process my Host OS Windows 8.1 is getting corrupted and I had to reinstall the Windows OS (Tried this 3 times already). Can someone please tell me the right way of uninstalling the Ubuntu Server from the Hyper-V virtual machine.\n\nA: Normally if you want a new operating system you just put in the install cd (or in your case you can add a iso file). After that you click the hdd you want to install it on and then you format the partition (all the files will be deleted). You've then a new os installed and the old one removed. If this is not what you want you can also use a iso to erase the hdd or you can use gparted on the ubuntu install cd to format the hdd.\n", "Q: .png Images will not display on webpage I am having an issue where my '.png' images will not display in my webpage.

Hybernate is disabled by default as it does not work in all systems.\n\n\nI don't have any use for a separate /opt partition. But, if you install a lot of software manually, this may be useful. If you decide to get rid of it, you may allocate this space either to /, where the /opt folder will be.

Is it only for other Linux distributions? After running this script as root, the output I get is Log files cleaned up. But /var/log still contains all the files.\n\nA: > is output redirecting operator. It will redirect the output of  command to file mentioned after it instead of standard output device, truncating or overwriting file's contents. \nfor example ls -l > demo.txt. After executing this command, \"demo.txt\"\n will contain th output ls -l command.\nNow next thing is what is this /dev/null./dev/null is the null file Is is a special file which contains nothing.\nSo when you execute commands\ncat /dev/null > messages\ncat /dev/null > wtmp\n\nit clears the contents of  \"messages\" and \"wtmp\" file by overwriting with EOF(End Of File) character.\nSo here you are not clearing your /var/log directory, but you are clearing the contents of these two files.\n\nA: Assuming the commands succeeded, /var/log/messages and /var/log/wtmp still exist but are now blank.\nShell Redirection\n> is a redirection operator, implemented by the shell. Its syntax is:\ncommand > file\nThis redirects command's standard output to file.\n\n\n*\n\n*file may also be a device node.\n\n*If file doesn't exist, it is created as a regular file.\n\n*If file already exists as a regular file and is non-empty, it is overwritten. This is typically the case in the commands you ran, where you redirected the output of cat /dev/null to messages and wtmp.\n\n*If file already exists as a symbolic link, the link's target is used.\n\n*If file already exists as a directory, you'll get an error like bash: file: Is a directory.\n\n\n(Of course, these operations may fail for other reasons, such as lack of permissions or a filesystem error.)\nThe >> redirection operator is similar, but it appends to the end of non-empty regular files instead of overwriting their contents. (Another redirection operator is <. command < file uses file as command's standard input.)\nThe null Device\n/dev/null is a simple device (implemented in software and not corresponding to any hardware device on the system).\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/null looks empty when you read from it.\n\n*Writing to /dev/null does nothing: data written to this device simply \"disappear.\"\n\n\nOften a command's standard output is silenced by redirecting it to /dev/null, and this is perhaps the null device's commonest use in shell scripting:\ncommand > /dev/null\nYou're using /dev/null differently. cat /dev/null outputs the \"contents\" of /dev/null, which is to say its output is blank. > messages (or > wtmp) causes this blank output to be redirected to the file on the right side of the > operator.\nSince messages and wtmp are regular files (rather than, for example, device nodes), they are turned into blank files (i.e., emptied).\nYou could use any command that does nothing and produces no output, to the left of >.\nAn alternative way to clear these files would be to run:\necho -n > messages\necho -n > wtmp\n\nThe -n flag is required, or echo writes a newline character.\n(This always works in bash. And I believe the default sh in every GNU/Linux distribution and other Unix-like system popularly used today supports the -n flag in its echo builtin. But jlliagre is right that echo -n should be avoided for a truly portable shell script, as it's not required to work. Maybe that's why the guide you're using teaches the cat /dev/null way instead.)\nThe echo -n way is equivalent in its effects but arguably is a better solution, in that it's simpler.\ncat /dev/null > file opens three \"files\":\n\n\n*\n\n*The cat executable (usually /bin/cat), a regular file.\n\n*The /dev/null device.\n\n*file\nIn contrast, echo -n > file opens only file (echo is a shell builtin).\nAlthough this should be expected to improve performance, that's not the benefit--not when just running a couple of these commands by hand, anyway. Instead, the benefit is that it's easier to understand what's going on.\nRedirection and the trivial (blank/empty) command.\nAs jlliagre has pointed out (see also jlliagre's answer), this can be shortened further by simply omitting the command on the left of > altogether. While you cannot omit the right side of a > or >> expression, the blank command is valid (it's the command you're running when you just press Enter on an empty prompt), and in omitting the left side you're just redirecting the output of that command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that this output does not contain a newline. When you press Enter on a command prompt--whether or not you've typed anything--the shell (running interactively) prints a newline before running the command issued. This newline is not part of the command's output.\n\n\nRedirecting from the blank command (instead of from cat /dev/null or echo -n) looks like:\n&gt messages\n&gt wtmp\n\nA: cat will list the contents of a file comming after cat to standard output and the > sends it to the file messages and wtmp where > means to first remove all contents of the file and >> would mean to ADD to the current file. In this case you are using > so the file will end up being empty.\nNow for the kicker: /dev/null is a device that sends 'nothing' to the 2 files behind the >. \nThere is a reason to do it like this: the file is NOT removed from the system. If you would rm it and then do a touch messages the permissions might be wrong and if just after the rm something would want to write to the file it would be gone and error out. Depending on how the software is created it could crash. \n\nA: As already answered, these two lines are clearing the content of the /var/log/messages and /var/log/wtmp files, or are creating them in the unlikely event they do not already exist.\nHowever, they are based on a well established urban legend that gives /dev/null \"paranormal\" powers.\nIt actually has none so cat /dev/null is a waste of keystrokes, time and CPU cycles as it outputs absolutely nothing. Eliah Kagan's reply suggests the better approach which is using echo -n instead. This is better but not portable to some shells/OSes where it might put the '-n' string into these files.\nYou can go further and replace these commands by the portable and simpler:\ncd /var/log\n: > messages\n: > wtmp\necho \"Log files cleaned up.\"\n\nWith most shells (but not the csh based ones), you can go even further and remove the no-op command ':' :\ncd /var/log\n> messages\n> wtmp\necho \"Log files cleaned up.\"\n\n\nA: /dev/null is like a  black hole. Writes made to the /dev/null are discarded. In this script, they are using /dev/null to empty the message log file.\nOtherwise they could have simply used.\n > /var/log/messages.\n\nThere are other ways to empty the contents of a file.\nLike.\n     truncate  -s  0  /var/log/messages\n     cp  /dev/null  /var/log/messages\n\nBut using \">\" or \"/dev/null\" is the efficient way.\n", "Q: 32 bits processor and partition size on SSD I am looking for advice.

So I got this script from this guide:  www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/abs-guide.pdf\nLOG_DIR=/var/log\nROOT_UID=0\nLINES=50\nE_XCD=86\nE_NOTROOT=87\n\nif [ \"$UID\" != \"$ROOT_UID\" ]\nthen\necho \"Must be root to run this script.\"\nexit $E_NOTROOT\nfi\n\nif [ -n \"$1\" ]\nthen\nlines=$1\nelse\nlines=$LINES\nfi\n\ncd $LOG_DIR\n\nif [ 'pwd' != \"$LOG_DIR\" ]\nthen\necho \"Can't change to $LOG_DIR.\"\nexit $E_XCD\nfi\n\nNow I did sudo su on terminal and echoed $UID which gives me 0. That means my if condition turns out to be false but still I am getting \"Must be root to run this script.\" while running this script.\nAlso in original script this if condition was given as  \nif [ \"$UID\" -ne \"$ROOT_UID\" ]\n\nbut I was getting Illegal number error because apparently -ne is only used for string so I changed it to !=.\n\nA: Instead of executing it with\nsh script.sh\n\nexecute it with\nbash script.sh\n\n(or add #!/bin/bash as the first line to set the interpreter).\nThe sh shell in Ubuntu is not bash, but a separate shell called dash. dash does not have as many features as bash, which makes it more efficient, but these missing features sometimes break scripts intended for bash. One such feature is the  $UID variable, which is not defined in dash.\nThis means that when the script is executed in dash, the comparison will become [\"\" != \"0\"], which evaluates to true no matter what user is running it. However, if it is run in bash with root permissions, the strings will be equal, and the script will work.\n\nA: As McLovin says, the automatically set, readonly UID (and EUID) variable is a special feature of bash (and some other shells). It's not standard for Bourne-style shells and sh cannot be assumed to set these variables. In particular, sh in Ubuntu is (currently, by default) dash, which does not set them.\nYou have two options:\n\n*\n\n*Cause your script to be run by bash instead of sh.\n\n*Change your script so it's more portable and doesn't require bash.\n\nRunning Your Script With bash\nYou haven't told us the name of your script (which is okay). I'm going to call it cleanup, as that's the name of the similar script in the guide you're working from.\nNote in particular that I am not calling it something like cleanup.sh. This is because I don't recommend you name it with a .sh suffix:\n\n*\n\n*A .sh suffix suggests it is compatible with sh!\n\n*Most scripts aren't given a suffix at all, and having a .sh or .bash suffix may even be interpreted as suggesting your file is a \"library\" rather than a \"top level\" script. That is, that it provides code to be sourced by other scripts (for example, with the . builtin) rather than actually run directly.\n\nHowever, including a .sh suffix will not affect the technical behavior of your script in any way. There is no technical advantage or disadvantage associated with doing so.\nAdd a hashbang line as the very first line of your script: #!/bin/bash\nMake your script executable with chmod +x cleanup.\nNow you can run your script by running the command:\n\n*\n\n*./cleanup, when it's in the current directory. (Especially when scripting for education, exploration, testing, fun, or other limited or one-time use, this is perhaps the most common way.)\n\n\n*/path/to/cleanup, in general. If the first word of a command contains a / it is interpreted as path to an executable file. (That's the reason for the above ./ syntax, as . means the current directory.)\nBy first word I mean the command up to but not including its first unescaped space or tab:\nfoo-bar/baz is the first word of foo-bar/baz qux, while spam\\ ham is the first word of spam\\ ham eggs because the space before ham is escaped with a backslash.\n\n\n*cleanup, if it's in a directory in your PATH (and no directory listed first has an executable of the same name, and it is not superseded by a shell builtin, function, or alias).\nRegardless of whether or not a script cleanup has a #!... hashbang line or what that line says:\n\n*\n\n*sh cleanup will still (attempt to) run it with sh as the interpreter.\n\n*bash cleanup will still (attempt to) run it with bash as the interpreter.\n\nThis is because, in those cases, you are actually running the interpreter (sh or bash) and passing the name of the script to the interpreter, to be run. Many programs accept names of files to open on the command line, and shells like sh and bash follow this convention.\nMaking Your Script Portable\nIf you want to make your script portable, the simplest way is to not use $UID at all, and instead use some facility available to all Bourne-style shells.\nIn general there's no built-in shell facility to determine user ID. But you can use id. This is an external program rather than a shell builtin, but like cat and ls, it's reasonable to expect it will be present.\nid by itself outputs a bunch of info, but id -u gives just the effective user ID.\nSo instead of if [ \"$UID\" != \"$ROOT_UID\" ], you can use:\nif [ \"$(id -u)\" != \"$ROOT_UID\" ]\n\nTechnically, this is not equivalent. $UID in bash gives the real user ID, and id -u really corresponds to bash's $EUID. If you really want the UID and not the EUID, use id -ru.\n", "Q: Why my Alt Tab has become ugly? under Kubuntu 14.04 I don't know why and when it happened, but now, when I use ALT+TAB, it only displays icons of the applications instead of previews.\nAlso, when I moved the cursor of my mouse in the top left corner of the screen, an overview of all windows was displayed.

I created a 26 Gig partition D: using a partition program and it is formatted as NTFS.  When I boot off of my Ubuntu Linux 14 disk and select the D: partition it says no root system defined.

When I was running Linux 11 it could be installed within Windows you create a dual boot system setup and could be removed through Windows uninstall program.\n\nA: Below are the steps for manual partitioning.  Note that Linux uses the EXT3/EXT4 file system, not NTFS, though this is something you can fix through the installer.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the installer, right click on the partition where you want to install Ubuntu and select \"configure\" (or something similar)\n\n*Choose ext3 or ext4 as the file system \n\n*Under the \"use as\" drop-down, select \"/\".  \n\n*Check the box next to \"Format?\" so the installer will automatically convert the partition from the NTFS file system to EXT3/EXT4.\nNote that a swap partition is typically recommended, so I would recommend creating another partition (~4 GB or so) to use as swap.  Linux uses swap space in case the computer runs out of RAM.  To set up the swap partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the partition you want to use as swap and select \"configure\"\n\n*Choose \"swap\" from the Format drop-down\n\n*Choose \"swap\" from the Use as drop-down\n\n*Check the box next to \"Format\"\nAs you mention there used to be an option to install Ubuntu within Windows (through a program called WUBI), but unfortunately WUBI has been discontinued since Ubuntu 12.04.\n", "Q: How to overcome the `connect failed` exception with mongodb?

So, school is approaching quickly, and one of the things on my supply list is a usb drive. Now I'm asking myself what filesystem to use. After some research, I found ext4 to be the most stable drive filesystem. But, I also found that Windows (The OS used by every computer in my school) can't read ext4 formatted drives without special drivers, and I'm sure the school wouldn't be too happy with me having to install the windows ext4 drivers on every computer I use with my usb. So, my question is, Should I use fat32, one of the ext filesystems (2, 3 or 4 would work) or NTFS, I have an ubuntu laptop, a Mac desktop, and of course the school computers I use are Windows, so which would be the best filesystem for my usb.\n\nA: You might consider exFAT. You didn't say whether this is a USB Flash drive or rotational hard drive. If you are talking Flash, over time you might want to reduce unnecessary writing to it so that means avoiding ext4 journaling, for example. I have read exFAT has some advantages for Flash drives, and it avoids some of the big problems (mainly file size limitations) in FAT32. The downside (in my experience) is it's not as stable in Ubuntu as the other filesystems. The big upside (I have read) is it is supported in all recent versions of Windows. (I don't use Windows so I cannot say.)\nTo install exFAT support in Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils\n\n[in the Universe repository for Ubuntu 12.04 and later]\nTo format an exFAT partition:\nsudo mkfs.exfat -n LABEL /dev/sdXn\n\nor\nsudo mkexfatfs -n LABEL /dev/sdXn\n\nTo change the label:\nsudo exfatlabel /dev/sdXn NEW_LABEL\n\nGet filesystem info:\nsudo dumpexfat /dev/sdXn\n\nTo check the partition:\nsudo fsck.exfat /dev/sdXn\n\nor\nsudo exfatfsck /dev/sdXn\n\n", "Q: How to solve package issues/dependencies Background info\nI am trying to install Veins simulation environment by following the tutorial provided by the author. \nIn step 1 it is required to install some packages in Linux, the tutorial suggest this commands to be executed on Terminal:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential gcc g++ bison flex perl tcl-dev tk-dev blt libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev default-jre doxygen graphviz libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libpcap-dev autoconf automake libtool libxerces-c2-dev proj libgdal1-dev libfox-1.6-dev\n\nWhen I execute this command, I immediately get:\nE: Package 'proj' has no installation candidate\n\nThen I remove the proj from the command and execute it again without proj in  it, next I get:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libgdal1-dev : Depends: libgdal-dev but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nSo, I remove libgdal1-dev from the command as well.

In truth the answer is no. You'd have to go into developer mode because unlike most Windows & Mac pc's Chromebooks has an entirely different boot loader. If you start up the pc you can see that instead of your regular company logo(whoever made the pc) it just goes directly to Chrome Os. So instead of giving you boot up options at start up you have to go to developer mode if you want to change anything to do with the boot up. Sorry. But the good news is that if yo memory is backed up and your facts and method is straight, depending on your steps in developer mode Chrome Os will always be hiding on your pc and if something goes wrong it's easy to get back into Chrome Os.     \n\nA: \nChrUbuntu: ChrUbuntu is a Ubuntu system built for Chromebooks. It works like a\n  traditional dual-boot system. You can restart your Chromebook and choose between\n  Chrome OS and Ubuntu at boot time. ChrUbuntu can be installed on your Chromebook’s\n  internal storage or on a USB device or SD card.\nCrouton: Crouton actually uses a “chroot” environment to run both Chrome OS and Ubuntu\n  at the same time. Ubuntu runs alongside Chrome OS, so you can switch between Chrome\n  OS and your standard Linux desktop environment with a keyboard shortcut. This gives you\n  the ability to take advantage of both environments without any rebooting needed. Crouton\n  allows you to use Chrome OS while having a standard Linux environment with all its\n  command-line tools and desktop applications a few keystrokes away.\n\nthe article is on how-to-geek and walks you through the steps. there are also plenty of youtube videos that walk you through the process.\nnote: you should always do a backup on files that are important to you!\nenable dev mode\ndownload and install [type]\nwhere [type] is either crouton or chrubuntu. the guide installs crouton.\nalt keys to move between environs\nwhat you can do with linux on chromebook\nturn dev mod off when you want to restore\nthis process is dependent upon the type of chromebook\nsite: \n", "Q: Using Ubuntu command line to replace text in huge file I have a huge XML file that I must work with. Right now the file is only 1 line that contains about 2 million characters which represent 30,000 records. There are no carriage returns or linefeeds whatsoever. What I need to do is make each record on it's own line.

I can't connect to the internet, the only thing I can do is change the background colour from black to blue or purple. I'm not very tech savvy so please use fairly simple language. Is there anything I can do?\n\nA: Try to get access to a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1.  If it works, log in and try the following commands to continue an interrupted update:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade \n\nIf you don't have Internet, here's something else you can try:\nFirst, boot an Ubuntu live CD and click the \"Try Ubuntu\" option.  When you get to a desktop, connect to a wifi network.  Then open a terminal and type:\nsudo mount /dev/<sdaX> /mnt\n\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\n\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\n\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\napt-get update\n\napt-get upgrade\n\nNote that instead of /dev/sdaX in the first command, type whatever partition Ubuntu is installed in.  If you don't know, install gparted from the software center, open it, and figure it out from the partition sizes.\nIf nothing works and you just want to back up and reinstall, then from the Live CD session open the file browser, and on the left hand side you should be able to see your hard disk and access all your files.  From there, you can copy your home folder to a flash drive/external HDD.\n", "Q: Last.fm scrobbling on Ubuntu Touch Does the default Music app on Ubuntu Touch support (realtime) Last.fm scrobbling?\n\nA: According to the developers there is no support for Last.fm/Libre.fm scrobbling implemented at the moment, but they seem to be positive for the future: https://answers.launchpad.net/music-app/+question/269528 \n", "Q: notify-send does not work with root on Ubuntu 14.04 I have a small python script that I start it using a shell script stored in \n\"/etc/X11/Xsession.d\" \nThe code is very simple it show a notification message\nimport os\nimport time\n\nwhile True:\n      os.system('notify-send -i \"/opt/say/logo.png\" \"Title\" \"Message\"')\ntime.sleep(30) \n\nThe code simply shows a notification message every 30 seconds.

I am developing an app using Qt designer and struggling with mechanizing the icon resource themes. Essentially, I'd like to access all of the standard icons when I click choose resource. Where on earth is the standard icon resource. \nthanks\n\nA: Qt's resource system is for icons you bundle with your program. It's not the same thing as the system icon theme. To use a system icon, here's what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the triangle next to icon in Qt Designer's property editor. You'll see a Theme row in the expanded view which accepts arbitrary text.\n\n*Find your icon theme in /usr/share/icons, check what the icon's filename is, and then check the XDG Icon Naming Specification to make sure you're using the official name and not some compatibility alias for an older desktop that not all themes will provide.\n\n*Fill in the icon's filename, without the extension, in the Theme row. Qt will use this to request the icon from the system theme at runtime. If you got the name right, you should see the icon appear in the Qt Designer preview immediately after pasting or typing the last letter of the name.\n\n*As a fallback, you need to also build a resource from the icons. According to the Qt docs, you can use rcc -project to generate a resource file from the icon theme but I've yet to do that, so you'll have to figure out the minutae of that yourself.\nI'd probably just add the icons to a resource bundle manually using the Resource Browser and then set the Normal Off row below Theme since Qt Designer's behaviour seems to indicate that it'll be treated as a fallback for the system icon theme.\n", "Q: What is the default VNC server included?

The home variables are set.\nI had Groovy installed via apt so IntelliJ could find it. But via the gvm not. What's wrong there?\n\nA: Grails is located in your home folder's .gvm/grails. Go to your home folder from intelliJ and right click it, you will have the option to show hidden folder's. There you will find .gvm/grails. You can point intelliJ to the current folder located there which is the symbolic link to whichever grails you make default using gvm or you can point to any grails version you like.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I had the same problem with version 15 IntelliJ after upgrading on OS Linux Ubuntu 12.04\nI found that because the Android SDK wasn't in the home folder of the user running IntelliJ that you had to change the Folder/file permissions before it would see this\nMine was in the root \nIssuing the command chown -R /path/to/android_sdk_dir solved the problem for me\nIf this fails after doing this delete the ~/.ideaC(Lastversion number) any previous ~/.ideaC(Lastversion numbers) folder's and then re open intelliJ\nYou will have to go through the initialization of the IDE and give the path to your Java installation ver8 upwards only on intelliJ version15 and there after your android sdk installation\nI found this can also cause conflicts\nAs a further tip add the following to the very end of your ~/.bashrc using one of your editors (nano , vi etc )\nExample vi ~/.bashrc\nThe following lines set the Android Path\nPATH=$PATH:/path/to/android/:/path/to/android/tools\nexport PATH\n\nFor SDK version r_08 and higher, also add these two lines for adb:\nPATH=$PATH:/path/to/android/platform-tools\nexport PATH\n\nfor setting android emulator to 32 bit version add this line\nexport ANDROID_EMULATOR_FORCE_32BIT=true\n\nExit your choice of editor (vi, nano, etc ) saving your bashrc file  then source .bashrc with the command below\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nHope that helps you\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 7377 Sound Problem Install of 14.04.1 was smooth, and everything runs beautifully...except there's no sound.At all.It shows that I'm using the realtek ALC283 drivers, and the card shows up in both ALSA and pavucontrol, and pavucontrol shows that there's sound being passed to it...so why's it silent?

If instead I chose the option to do something else, the continue button was still grayed out.  I was given absolutely no explanation for why it was grayed out.\nThe only option that would let me continue was to erase the disk, which I do not want to do.\nI have two hard disks, and one of them has two partitions on it.  The second partition is completely unused, and has a terabyte of space.  That's where I wanted to install it.\nCan somebody please tell me why I can't install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 here?\n\nA: In case anybody else has the same issue, the problem was that my hard disk had two real partitions in it.  I thought that since the second one was completely unused, Linux would know that it could use that.  Instead, the second half of the drive needed to be labelled as unused, completely free space.  \n\n\n*\n\n*I booted a live disc, then chose Try Ubuntu.\n\n*I launched GParted (by typing \"gparted\" in the search box in top left).\n\n*In GParted, the top right of the window has a drop down box that lets you select your hard disk.  Be sure you pick the right one so you don't accidentally delete data you want.  In my case, I switched to /dev/sdb, my second hard drive, and saw that it had \"essentially\" two partitions (there might have been more for some other OS functions, I can't remember).  \n\n*I selected the second partition(s), which were completely unused, and then told GParted to delete them.  \n\n*I then told GParted to apply my changes by clicking the green check mark.\n\n\nAfter that, I was able to install Ubuntu.  When I got to the screen to choose how to install it, I chose Install Ubuntu alongside Windows and Continue was no longer grayed out.\nI went on to have other issues that I am still trying to figure out, but I won't discuss them here.\n\nA: For me, oddly, going back and then forward again seems to have fixed the problem. A little disconcerting considering it's dealing with your HDD partitions.\n\nA: I solved the problem by going back and erasing the hard drive with GParted.\n\nA: In my case going back and choosing not to connect to a wifi network as part of the installation process solved the problem.\n", "Q: Trying to switch to 32-bit Wineprefix from 64-bit Wine 1.6.2 (Trusty 14.04) I'm having a little trouble with Wine 1.6.1.

In the meantime, I'll try to keep looking for solutions on my own.\n\nA: Create a 32-bit Windows wine prefix:\nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine32 WINEARCH=win32 winecfg\n\n(or win64 as winearch)\nUsage of prefix - with env:\nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine32 command arguments[...]\n\ncommand is like wine setup.exe.\nFor more info, see man env.\n$HOME/.wine32 is your prefix name (actually, /home/username/.wine32) and you have to specify it always to use it. \nDefault WINEPREFIX is ~/.wine, you can re-create it by removing (with any changes): unrecommended\nrm -R ~/.wine\n\nYou cannot change architecture of a prefix without re-creation in future. For different games I recommend a separate wine prefix (or for different game clients like EA Origin)\n\nA: Just like you can't easily convert from a 32bit system to a 64bit system in place without a clean installation, you can't convert a 64-bit Wine prefix to a 32-bit one.  The only way to achieve this is to either blow away your wine prefix and replace it with a 32bit one, or create a separate 32-bit prefix.  Wine recommends the second of these options.\nWine even suggests that you keep separate prefixes if you need 32bit or 64bit.  The best guide for this is here on Wine's wiki.  Effectively, run this command: WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=/home/$USER/.wine32 winecfg to create the .wine32 folder/prefix.\nFrom there, you can run the following: WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=/home/$USER/.wine32 wine /path/to/exe.  This will then run whatever .exe the path points to. You should use this entire command to effectively force run in the 32bit environment any 32bit programs that you need to run in that 32-bit prefix.\n(NOTE: This information was partly obtained from the in-depth guide I wrote for the Secure Download Manager for Microsoft Dreamspark and such.  That is part of the notes here.  Note that these steps here are extremely useful and are almost guaranteed to work as they are intended to.)\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on SSD and Keep Personal files on NTFS drive I currently have Windows 7 installed on an SSD and just got another SSD which I want to install Ubuntu on. My current setup with Windows 7 is that I have all of my games and apps installed on the SSD, but I have all of the personal folders like \"My Music,\" \"My Videos,\" \"Desktop\" and others point to a regular HDD. That way whatever files I have on my desktop are actually stored on the regular HDD, and not the SSD. These files are ordinary files that any OS can open, such as pictures, videos, etc.\nMy question is whether I can get Ubuntu to use that same drive for the /home directory so that all of my personal files are stored on there as well, but without reformatting it. I would like to be able to still use it with the current setup that I have on Windows 7, but I would like Ubuntu to use it as well. Is there a way for me to do this? The HDD is formatted as NTFS.\nPlease let me know if I wasn't clear or if more detail is needed. Thanks\n\nA: Yes, that should be easily doable.  You can create new partition in the HDD for your home directory, and put the rest of the system files on the SSD.  You won't have to format the HDD, but you'll probably have to shrink the partition storing your Windows documents to make room for your Ubuntu /home partition.  Also, keep in mind you won't be able to access your Ubuntu documents from Windows (though you'll be able to access your Windows documents from Ubuntu) because Windows cannot read ext3/ext4 partitions.\nTo shrink the HDD partition storing your Windows documents, I'd recommend using the Disk Management tool in Windows.  Right click on the partition and select \"Shrink Volume,\" to create space for your Ubuntu documents.\nAfter this you should be able to start installing.  I don't have the Ubuntu installer in front of me right now but I'll try to describe the process as best I can.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu install CD and follow the installation prompts.\n\n*When it gets to the disk partitioning section and asks how you want to install, select \"Something Else\" to go to the manual partitioning options\n\n*Right click on the unallocated space in your new SSD where you want to install Ubuntu's system files.

Please look at this auth.log (from Ubuntu 14.04) I have provided and tell me who this gdm user is and why there are all these unauthenticated logins? I am freaked out; please help!\nHere's the /var/log/auth.log file: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8120231/\nUpdate: I know now that \"gdm\" is gnome desktop manager and it's there because of root. But please look at the log there is more and tell me if my system is breached.\n\nA: The entries in your auth.log involving the gdm user appear normal. This is nothing to worry about. I'm not sure what you mean by \"unauthenticated logins\" but if you just mean no human entered a username and password for them, that's not a problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're referring to where it says \"Unregistered Authentication Agent,\" that does not mean a login occurred without proper authentication. I suspect this is not a problem at all; certainly, it doesn't signify a security breach. In this context, \"Unregistered\" is an action. Here, \"registered\" means it \"started using\" an authentication agent and \"unregistered\" means it \"stopped using\" an authentication agent it had started using before.\n\n\n(Feel free to elaborate further about that or any other aspect of your question, by editing your question. If you post a comment on this answer, I'll take a look at the edited question.)\nGDM is the GNOME Display Manager. A display manager runs the X11 (the core part of the GUI), provides a graphical login screen, and sets up and takes down graphical login sessions.\nThe part of GDM that provides the login screen, or greeter, does not need to run with unlimited privileges. So it is run as a special limited user account called gdm. This same principle applies to other display managers, such as LightDM (which is more commonly used on Ubuntu these days than GDM).\nThe gdm account doesn't have to authenticate because the logins are being created by the root user, who can already do anything.\nTo support what I've said above, and also elaborate on it and provide a greater degree of technical detail, I recommend the official GDM documentation, particularly the Security section.\nMost relevant is subsection 3.1, \"The GDM User And Group\":\n\nFor security reasons a dedicated user and group id are recommended for\n  proper operation. This user and group are normally \"gdm\" on most\n  systems, but can be configured to any user or group. All GDM GUI\n  programs are run as this user, so that the programs which interact\n  with the user are run in a sandbox. This user and group should have\n  limited privilege.\nThe only special privilege the \"gdm\" user requires is the ability to\n  read and write Xauth files to the <var>/run/gdm directory. The\n  <var>/run/gdm directory should have root:gdm ownership and 1777\n  permissions.\nYou should not, under any circumstances, configure the GDM user/group\n  to a user which a user could easily gain access to, such as the user\n  nobody. Any user who gains access to an Xauth key can snoop on and\n  control running GUI programs running in the associated session or\n  perform a denial-of-service attack on it. It is important to ensure\n  that the system is configured properly so that only the \"gdm\" user has\n  access to these files and that it is not easy to login to this\n  account. For example, the account should be setup to not have a\n  password or allow non-root users to login to the account.\n....\n\nAs clarified there:\n\n\n*\n\n*The gdm user account enhances security.\n\n*It is a limited user account, that exists for a highly specific purpose.\n\n*Logins to the gdm user account are performed directly by root, and not with a password or by users other than root.\n\n\nA: I think you are worrying about nothing GDM is the gnome display manager, it is responsible for making your log in screen look gnome themed.\nTry doing this to find out\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nYou can in fact use lightdm instead of gdm, the procedure is same for both. Using the above mentioned command will take you to a warning page. Enter to get back to next screen:\nOn the next screen, you’ll see all the available display managers. Use tab to select your preferred one and then press enter, Once you have selected it, press tab to go to ok and press enter again.\nRestart the system and you will find your selected display manager at login. The same procedure can be applied to switch between GDM, LightGDM, MDM, KDM etc.\nUse the info above to change to the LightDM version, and you will see all new log-in GDM entries in the file you posted change to lightDM.\nIt is in your authentication log due to having root privileges.\nHope this helps \nSource for the tutorial HERE\n", "Q: How do disable the CD-ROM for all users?

I am writing some scripts which need to programatically get a lot of networking parameters from Linux OS.\nFor example, the names of all network interfaces, ip address, netmask, MAC address. For wireless interface, I may also need to get the bit rate, frequency, operating mode, transmit power, signal level, noise level, etc.\nCurrently, I am using normal text progressing and regular expression to parse the output of Linux command line tools like ifconfig, ip, route, iw and iwconfig. One of the problems of this method is that sometimes the output will be different from what we have expected. It is difficult to predict all possible output format for all possible scenarios.\nIs there a better way to programatically get the networking parameters from Linux OS?\n\nA: For the names of all the defined network interfaces, I'd just look at the contents of the /sys/class/net directory.\nFor the rest, it depends what you mean by \"Linux OS\". If you are referring to current desktop versions of Ubuntu, then the nmcli command-line utility seems to provide a lot of the functionality that you are looking for e.g.\n$ nmcli --terse --fields FREQ,RATE,SIGNAL dev wifi list bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n5220 MHz:54 MB/s:70\n\n$ nmcli --terse --fields IP4 dev list iface wlan0\nIP4.ADDRESS[1]:ip = 192.168.1.16/24, gw = 192.168.1.1\nIP4.DNS[1]:192.168.1.1\n\nIf that does not provide the fine control that you need, you could roll your own by interfacing to DBUS either using the command-line dbus-send and/or dbus-monitor tools or the C or python DBUS API's - the documentation is a bit thin but there are one or two helpful tutorials for example Dbus Tutorial - Fun with Network Manager\n\nA: this may help (providing you do not mind python):\nhttp://it-ebooks.info/book/3515/\npage 66 (79)\nsince this recipe rely on c sys-calls you may be much better off writing a module in C.\n", "Q: Is there any GUI application for command rsync?

I'm currently still on Ubuntu 8.10 and now wish to upgrade the latest version (14.04 at the time of writing). First of all is it safe to update from such an old version? What problems should I expect to have to deal with?\nWhat's the best way to keep my user preferences and data intact? I specifically want to keep:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tomboy notes\n\n*Firefox scrapbook pages (extension)\n\n*Mozilla Evolution email history/address book\n\n\nA: Backing up your home directory should be sufficient to keep your personal data.  If for some reason you have please files in other areas on your file system apart from it's defaults, it's something you may have continuously specified, you should back that up also.\nUpgrading on Ubuntu is failrly safe.  But it's possible that you can incur some problems from coming back from so far.  I don't think it will take you all the way from 8.10 to 14.0, it'll upgrade you in steps... first to 9.x, 10.x, 11.x etc.  So it will take a while to get up to 14.04.\nBefore stating your upgrade, try to insure you have the latest updates for the version that you're running by running:\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAnd reboot if the system prompts you.\nIf the upgrade fails you can always perform a full install, just don't choose the format option.  It'll prompt you that your nomral /etc /bin /sbin (and other system directories) will be removed and recreated.  Your /home directory will not be removed.\nBy the way, there are significant changes from 8.10 to 14.04 in that many of your configuration preference might not be supported on the new OS.  You might consider starting a fresh home directory and systematically bringing your documents and other personal files from your home directory backup to your new home directory.\n\nA: I dont think you can upgrade that far 08.10 is 6 years old, there is no chance the servers are been maintained for this, You need do do a clean install of 14.04.\n", "Q: Claws Mail stuck in full-screen mode I have Ubuntu 12.04 and claws mail 3.8.0.  Suddenly and I don't know why, Claws was in full-screen mode and I cannot close it normally.  The menu at the top does not show. Now I have to go to \"compose\" so I can get my icons up, then left click and then quit.  I can't find any menu item to get it out of full-screen mode. We have been using ubuntu since April so we have some experience with it, but we are far from experts.\n\nA: Use the menu item View -> Fullscreen, or hit the default full screen hotkey F11.\n", "Q: how to install new download of 14.04.1-desktop-amd 64.ISO I have no idea what I am doing here. I was given an IBM ThinkPad with an outdated Ubuntu OS and could not figure out how to upgrade, so I simply downloaded the new 14.04.1-desktop-amd 64 ISO. The download completed. There is an icon on the desktop. But being a PC user for all my computer life... I cannot for the life of me figure out how to install this OS! Can anyone help me?\n\nA: Coming from Windows shouldn't be a problem for installing an OS.  This installation is no different than installing a Windows ISO OS.  It's exactly the same.\nJust burn the ISO to a disk, boot to it, and follow the prompts.\nThe installation questions in Ubuntu should even be easier.  It basically asks for a user name and password, perform the installation and reboots into the OS.\nUpgrading should be just as easy.  The command to upgrade is:\n$ sudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThen follow the prompts.  The upgrade is different from Windows upgrade.  I don't think Windows has an equivalent.  It certainly doesn't have this simplicity.  But of course, this being different is a command that you would have had to be provided with to know it.\nThe system would normally advise you of this command periodically when there is an upgrade available.\n\nA: Test this:\nDownload 32-bit non-pae Xubuntu 12.04.5:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/precise/daily-live/current/precise-desktop-i386.iso\nJust burn the ISO to a disk or usb:\nhttp://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/u/unetbootin/unetbootin_603-1_i386.deb\nBoot to it, and follow the prompts.\n", "Q: Not able to Install I am not able to install any software (from software center) in ubuntu, after installing it gets failed and when i checked i detail, below error is coming .. please help me out for installing it,\ninstallArchives() failed: perl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nSetting up install-info (5.2.0.dfsg.1-2) ...\n/etc/environment: line 2: JAVA_HOME: command not found\ndpkg: error processing package install-info (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 127\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n install-info\nError in function: \nSetting up install-info (5.2.0.dfsg.1-2) ...\n/etc/environment: line 2: JAVA_HOME: command not found\ndpkg: error processing package install-info (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 127\n\nI have following output for /etc/environment, java_home is already installed there.\noutput of cat /etc/environment \nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/u‌​sr/local/games\" \nJAVA_HOME =/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin \n\nI have updated the language support and getting the below error\namulbhatia@Nadar:~$ sudo apt-get install language-pack-en\n[sudo] password for amulbhatia: \nReading package lists...

So when it encounters a line like:\nJAVA_HOME =/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin\n\nthe shell will interpret JAVA_HOME as a command because of the space before =, which is a grave error since JAVA_HOME is not found in the PATH nor defined as an alias or function. An error in a source causes the shell to exit (since maintenance scripts are run that way), which is why this error stopped installations. (Equivalently, a space after = causes the shell to see /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin as a command, which is not that bad, but still a problem.) So the correct line is:\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin\n\n\nA: I was facing the same problem for many months. I didn't give attention at first but it started troubling when I would download updates and they won't install. Finally, I found the solution. The problem was the path of JAVA_HOME. My path was: \nJAVA_HOME = '/usr/lib/jvm/java-9-oracle'\n\nI replaced it with\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-9-oracle\n\nSo, basically I removed the quotes and the spaces.\nHow to do it ?\nCheck the PATH and JAVA_HOME path variables by using \n$ cat /etc/environment\n\nIt shows something like\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\nJAVA_HOME = '/usr/lib/jvm/java-9-oracle'\nI suggest you to take a back up of the original environment variable in .orig using\nsudo cp /etc/environment /etc/environment.orig\n\nuse sudo nano command to forcefully change the variable path\nsudo nano -w /etc/environment\n\nAfter editing the path by removing quotes and spaces use Ctrl+X to exit, press Y to confirm and rename the new file.\nand check the path again.\n $ cat /etc/environment\n\nNow update and upgrade your system for smooth performance and installations.\n", "Q: unmet dependencies when using apt-get, how can I solve it?

After reinstalling both OSs several times my System boots right into Windows.\nSome information I gathered:\nIf I have a bootable USB (either Ubuntu or Windows) plug in and boot to the Windows recovery screen and select the boot from external device I can select Ubuntu and boot into it. There I installed the boot-repair tool which told me to deactivate the secure boot option in my BIOS, which I did, but which also didn't change anything. I ran boot-repair again and it got caught in an infinite loop doing the same things again and again with no option to cancel it. But I got the information log (http://paste.ubuntu.com/8121921/).  \nMy guess is that either Windows overwrote the grub or that I installed it to the wrong partition. But I screwed my System several times by now and it's still not working as it did with the OEM which is kind of a big deal 'cause I kinda need some features back for school...but that's some other story...  \nSo if someone could give me some (detailed) instructions on how to get grub to working again without killing Windows please tell me.\n\nA: You need to boot to a live CD/USB and install boot-repair\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nThen find boot-repair in the dash\nThen click the \"Recommended repair\" button. then reboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs\nDocumentation is HERE\n\nA: If you did duel-boot install i'm assuming you know how to enable system/laptop boot menu in both help infos/situations, if not i explained on the bottom.\nIf you get auto-windows when shutdown/boot your PC: hold the power button until it goes off, and use the key commands to open mini-boot(or, non-purple grub) menu scroll to the bottom with the arrows and open system setup. change the boot order so Ubuntu is first, this will enable the grub menu every time you turn off your PC, and you can use the arrow keys and enter to navigate, but you cannot switch on between windows and Linux unless you do a shutdown.\nIf your windows goes into a recovery loop after a few Ubuntu boots: change the boot order so windows is first. you won't get the grub, so you'll have to use the mini-boot every time you boot in Linux, but it'll boot faster without error.\nOh, and an example of accessing mini-boot menu is using tab + esc on an asus when it shows the logo, but before it does the circle indication its loading, it may be a different key combination if you use a different laptop brand, hope this helps.\n", "Q: dropbox slow on ubuntu 14.04 My dropbox syncing is incredibly slow...\nI am using dropbox from the ubuntu repository on an almost fresh ubuntu installation.\nI would like to avoid to install the package from the dropbox website for the reasons explained here Dropbox Upgrade\nIs someone having the same problem?

There seem to be quite a few people running into problems with IE8 crashing when opening tabs or even when loading pages.\nIf you need IE8 to do browser testing (e.g. for web development), I'd strongly recommend using a Windows virtual machine instead. modern.ie is an official Microsoft website that provides virtual machine images that should let you run IE8 in Windows 7 using VirtualBox on Ubuntu.\nIf you use Seamless Mode, you'll be able to use IE8 side-by-side with Ubuntu applications, and it won't even feel like a virtual machine (but the result will be a much more stable and accurate implementation of IE8).\n", "Q: Failed to unmount partitions I'm trying to install Ubuntu from a pen drive.

He explained how I could update and re-install GRUB.  \nUnfortunately for me though, after reinstalling GRUB, it still doesn't work.\nWhen I boot, it launches Windows 7.  If instead I tell it to boot using the new hard disk, it goes straight to grub rescue.\nSomebody please help me, this problem is consuming my entire weekend.\n\nA: @msknapp, while you were installing Ubuntu, you could have mounted a partition on internal and external disk. That is why you got that warnings. All you had to do was to close any application using internal disk. Now, you have to re-install Grub. Use Ubuntu Live CD/USB you created and use Boot-Repair to re-install grub. \nAs a side not, Ubuntu or any GNU/Linux distribution does not need so much - 1 TB - space. I recommend to you to use 20 GB for Ubuntu, if you do not intent to install applications use lots of space like games, then use extra space for storage or another purpose. \n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 - PulseAudio / ALSA will not work with USB headset Being relatively new to Linux, I just shot for Xubuntu.

Though if someone gives canonical, precise and up to the mark answer, it will be of great help to me as well as other web developers using Ubuntu around the world. \nOnce again thank you so much you great people around the globe.\nWaiting for your precious replies. \n\nA: \nWill upgrading to \"Ubuntu 14.04 'Trusty Tahr'\" affect the softwares I mentioned above? \n\nYes, you get newer versions. In general it means better version with bug fixes and new options. Sometimes something gets removed though that is being used by a person but that happens not too often.\nFor PHP and anything important I would suggest to search for the changelog for the new versions and the versions in between. You can run into problems with older software made with commands that got deprecated or even removed from the new coding language. \n\nI mean will I need to re-install/un-install and install these softwares too?\n\nNo. That happens during the upgrade automatically.\n\nDo I really need to and is it really a worth to upgrade to \"Ubuntu 14.04 'Trusty Tahr'\" from \"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\" now?\n\nNo. Your choice. When 12.04 ends we drop support for it, you do not get any updates BUT 12.04 will still work. It you use it with an internet connection you are increasing the risk of someone abusing a bug and gaining access to (parts of) your system. But even that is unlikely. But it is still your choice.\nAll in all I would upgrade at least a few months before support for 12.04 ends. 12.04 ends April 2017 so that is still a long way away. Heck, you might even have bought a new computer before that.\n\nIf I upgrade to \"Ubuntu 14.04 'Trusty Tahr'\" what advantage I'll get from web developer's point of view?\n\nNewer versions of software tends to be a good thing ;)\n\nWill the upgrade be hassle free and will I be ablr to continue my on-going work without any difficulties?\n\nNormally...yes. But problems can occur... if the power goes down during the upgrade you will run into problems (that are fixable though).\n\nIs \"Ubuntu 14.04 'Trusty Tahr'\" a LTS version and if yes til when it's going to provide support?\n\nYes. And April 2019 is the end of life month of 14.04.\n\nMind you!! You DO make backups of the software you create? If not then before you mess around with your operating system most, if not all, of us insist you make a backup 1st. Better safe than sorry. If you do make certain you know how to restore it and that it can be restored.\nPrepare for failure and if it fails it is just a bump on the road.

You are awesome :-) XD\n\nA: First, you my be misunderstanding the purpose of apt-fast.  It's not something for slow network connections, it's something for fast network connections.  If you have a slow connection to the Internet, you are not reaching the bottleneck of the repository and will not benefit by pulling from more than one repository simultaneously.\nIf you have a fast Internet connection, faster than the repositories, then you could benefit by pulling from more than one repository at once.\nMore directly to your question, did you run the sudo apt-get update after adding the repository?\nIn between asking the question I tried the repository on a test machine and it appears to be broken (for ubuntu/trusty 14.04).  What error did you get when you tried to update the repository?\nAlternatively, with the apt-fast repository broken you can use the github.\nYou might also communicate the broken (or unavailable 14.04) repository to the apt-fast support team.\nWith the knowledge that you can't benefit from it on a machine with a slow Internet connection might be a factory in how much work you want to invest in installing it on your computer.\n\nA: Test this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T \n\n*Run it:\nsudo nano /usr/bin apt-fast\nPaste these lines:\n-------------------------------\n# !/bin/sh\n# apt-fast v0.03 by Matt Parnell http://www.mattparnell.com, this thing is fully open-source\n# if you do anything cool with it, let me know so I can publish or host it for you\n# contact me at admin@mattparnell.com\n\n# Special thanks\n# Travis/travisn000 - support for complex apt-get commands\n# Allan Hoffmeister - aria2c support\n# Abhishek Sharma - aria2c with proxy support\n# Richard Klien - Autocompletion, Download Size Checking (made for on ubuntu, untested on other distros)\n# Patrick Kramer Ruiz - suggestions - see Suggestions.txt\n# Sergio Silva - test to see if axel is installed, root detection/sudo autorun\n\n# Use this just like apt-get for faster package downloading.\n\n# Check for proper priveliges\n[ \"`whoami`\" = root ] || exec sudo \"$0\" \"$@\"\n\n# Test if the axel is installed\nif [ ! -x /usr/bin/axel ]\nthen echo \"axel is not installed, perform this?(y/n)\"\n    read ops\n    case $ops in\n         y) if apt-get install axel -y --force-yes\n               then echo \"axel installed\"\n            else echo \"unable to install the axel. you are using sudo?\" ; exit\n            fi ;;\n         n) echo \"not possible usage apt-fast\" ; exit ;;\n    esac\nfi\n\n# If the user entered arguments contain upgrade, install, or dist-upgrade\nif echo \"$@\" | grep -q \"upgrade\\|install\\|dist-upgrade\"; then\n  echo \"Working...\";\n\n  # Go into the directory apt-get normally puts downloaded packages\n  cd /var/cache/apt/archives/;\n\n  # Have apt-get print the information, including the URI's to the packages\n  # Strip out the URI's, and download the packages with Axel for speediness\n  # I found this regex elsewhere, showing how to manually strip package URI's you may need...thanks to whoever wrote it\n  apt-get -y --print-uris $@ | egrep -o -e \"(ht|f)tp://[^\\']+\" > apt-fast.list && cat apt-fast.list | xargs -l1 axel -a\n\n  # Perform the user's requested action via apt-get\n  apt-get $@;\n\n  echo -e \"\\nDone!

If your not running a certain amount of swap space, your not doing your memory any favours.\nTo make this more of an answer than a comment, I suggest also trying to remove as much of the extraneous bloatware that comes with ubuntu as possible. It's up to you to decide what you do and don't need, but go exploring. Run top -c and see which programs and services are using a lot of CPU, and if you don't need them running, kill the process. If you don't need them at all, purge them.\nAnother good place to look for stuff that uses resources is in the services. sudo service --status-all will give you a list of running services. I'm not going to assume that you aren't running a production server, but if you don't need apache2, sudo service apache2 stop, if you don't need mysql, cups, dictd, etc.. turn it off.

If you are using that version of Chrome, you should update to the latest.\nIf that isn't the issue, and the fonts are still too small for your preference, you can change Ubuntu's system fonts, and Chrome will respect your settings (after restarting Chrome).\nTaken from this answer:\n# check current font\n# for me, this returns Ubuntu 11\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name \n\n# set it to something larger\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Ubuntu 14'\n\nIf you prefer not to use the command line, you can change these settings using Unity Tweak Tool \nNote that this will change more than just Chrome's UI.

(This question deals with a similar issue, but it talks about a rotated log file.)\nToday I got a system message regarding very low /var space. \nAs usual I executed the commands in the line of sudo apt-get clean which improved the scenario only slightly. Then I\ndeleted the rotated log files which again provided very little improvement.\nUpon examination I find that some log files in the /var/log has grown up to be very huge ones. To be specific, ls -lSh /var/log gives,\n\ntotal 28G\n-rw-r----- 1 syslog            adm      14G Aug 23 21:56 kern.log\n-rw-r----- 1 syslog            adm      14G Aug 23 21:56 syslog\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root              utmp    390K Aug 23 21:47 wtmp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root              root    287K Aug 23 21:42 dpkg.log\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root              utmp    287K Aug 23 20:43 lastlog\n\n\nAs we can see, the first two are the offending ones. I am mildly surprised why such large files have not been rotated.\nSo, what should I do? Simply delete these files and then reboot? Or go for some more prudent steps?\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04.\nUPDATE 1\nTo begin with, the system is only several months old. I had to install the system from scratch couple of months back after a hard disk crash.\nNow, as advised in this answer, \nI first checked the offending log files using tail, no surprise there. Then, for deeper inspection, I executed this script from the same answer.\nfor log in /var/log/{syslog,kern.log}; do \n  echo \"${log} :\"\n  sed -e 's/\\[[^]]\\+\\]//' -e 's/.*[0-9]\\{2\\}:[0-9]\\{2\\}:[0-9]\\{2\\}//' ${log} \\\n  | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr | head -10\ndone\n\nThe process took several hours. \nThe output was in the line of,\n\n/var/log/syslog :\n71209229  Rafid-Hamiz-Dell kernel:  sda3: rw=1, want=7638104968240336200, limit=1681522688\n53929977  Rafid-Hamiz-Dell kernel:  attempt to access beyond end of device\n17280298  Rafid-Hamiz-Dell kernel:  attempt to access beyond end of device\n   1639  Rafid-Hamiz-Dell kernel:  EXT4-fs warning (device sda3): ext4_end_bio:317: I/O error -5 writing to inode 6819258 (offset 0 size 4096 starting block 54763121030042024)\n       <snipped>\n\n/var/log/kern.log.1 :\n71210257  Rafid-Hamiz-Dell kernel:  attempt to access beyond end of device\n71209212  Rafid-Hamiz-Dell kernel:  sda3: rw=1, want=7638104968240336200, limit=1681522688\n   1639  Rafid-Hamiz-Dell kernel:  EXT4-fs warning (device sda3): ext4_end_bio:317: I/O error -5 writing to inode 6819258 (offset 0 size 4096 starting block 954763121030042024)\n\n\n(/dev/sda3 is  my home directory.

Perhaps I will want to ask a different question in this forum if this\ncontinues even after a system update.)\nThen, from this answer (you may want to check this for a deeper understanding), I\nexecuted, \nsudo su -\n> kern.log\n> syslog\n\nNow, these files have zero sizes. The system is running fine before and after a reboot. \nI will watch these files (along with others) in the next few days and report back should\nthey behave out-of-line.\nAs a final note, both  the offending files (kern.log and syslog), are set to be rotated, as inspection of the files (grep helped) inside \n/etc/logrotate.d/ shows.\nUPDATE 2\nThe log files are actually rotated. Looks like the large sizes were attained on a single day.\n\nA: \nSimply delete these files and then reboot?\n\nNo. Empty them but do not use rm because it could end up crashing something while you are typing the touch command to recreate it.\nShortest method:\ncd /var/log\nsudo su\n> lastlog\n> wtmp\n> dpkg.log \n> kern.log\n> syslog\nexit\n\nIf not root it will require sudo. Taken from another answer on AU.\nBEFORE YOU DO THAT. Do a tail {logfile} and check if there is a reason for them to be so big. Unless this system is several years old there should be no reason for this and fixing the problem is better than letting this go on.\nBoth kern.log and syslog should normally not be that big. But like I said: if this system is up and running for years and years it might be normal and the files just need to be cleared.\nAnd to prevent it to become that big in the future: setup logrotate. It is pretty straightforward and will compress the logfile when it becomes bigger then a size you set it to.\n\n1 other thing: if you do not want to delete the contents you can compress the files by tarring or gzipping them. That will have you end up with files probably 10% of what they are now. That is if there is still room on the disk to do that.\n\nA: I installed Ubuntu 16.04 today and I noticed the same problem. However, I fixed this with busybox-syslogd. Yup! I've Just installed that package and problem has been solved. :)\n$ sudo apt-get install busybox-syslogd\n\nAfter installing that package, reset syslog and kern.log:\nsudo tee /var/log/syslog /var/log/kern.log </dev/null\n\nI hope this simple solution is useful to other people around.\n\nA: It's probably worth trying to establish what is filling the log(s) - either by simply examining them visually using the less or tail command\ntail -n 100 /var/log/syslog\n\nor if the offending lines are too deeply buried to easily see what's occuring, something like\nfor log in /var/log/{dmesg,syslog,kern.log}; do \n  echo \"${log} :\"\n  sed -e 's/\\[[^]]\\+\\]//' -e 's/.*[0-9]\\{2\\}:[0-9]\\{2\\}:[0-9]\\{2\\}//' ${log} \\\n  | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr | head -10\ndone\n\n(note: this may take some time, given such large files) which will attempt to strip off the timestamps and then count the most frequently occurring messages.\n\nA: My method for clean system log files is this. Steps 1 and 2 are optional, but sometimes you need check older logs and backup is sometimes useful. ;-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Optional: Copy log file\ncp -av --backup=numbered file.log file.log.old\n\n\n*Optional: Use Gzip on copy of log\ngzip file.log.old\n\n\n*Use /dev/null for clean file\ncat /dev/null > file.log\n\nAnd we use for this logs (only on several servers) logrotate and weekly execute by cron script which all files with *.1 (or next rotated) compress by gzip.\n", "Q: My touchpad on my ASUS K55N is not being detected To preface this, I couldn't get my FN keys to work for a few days after finally installing ubuntu and after a whole day of a black screen on start up, my fn keys starting working, but my trackpad stopped.\nI've tried checking for it under\n\n$ xinput list\n\nbut there is no touchpad that is being detected. \nI've only had Ubuntu for about a week so far and I've had nothing but problems, so if anyone knows what's wrong it would be greatly appreciated. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 by the way.\n\nA: Try these:\nsudo modprobe -rv psmouse\nsudo modprobe -v psmouse\n\n\nIt will remove-reload the psmouse driver which controls the touchpad in asus laptops.\nIf that does not help, try:\necho \"blacklist asus_nb_wmi\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n\nThen reboot and see if it helps.\nThe \"asus_nb_wmi\" driver mainly controls the wifi and bluetooth switch, but in combination of some other drivers, it also controls some other Fn+ hotkeys, including enable/disable touchpad.\nDisabling it will also disable some Fn+ key combinations, so this is just for a test. To remove it from blacklist to make it work again:\nsudo sed -i \"/asus_nb_wmi/ d\" /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n\nAlthough since your touchpad is entirely disappeared, I doubt if any of these trivial workarounds are going to fix it, but testing won't hurt. Maybe another update would fix it automatically.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 disable release notification of 14.04 in Update Manager Both my parents are still using Ubuntu 12.04 and we don't intent to upgrade to 14.04 in the near future.\nIs it possible to disable the upgrade notification in Update Manager? \nThis because it's just confusing for them.\n\n\nA: Edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set:\nPrompt=never\n\nIn the [DEFAULT] section (Use sudo with your favourite editor).\nAnd never run update-manager with -d.

Is there a way to do so?? Maybe a partition locking tool or anything.\nIs there a way to restrict access to windows files by Ubuntu users?\n\nA: Easiest method: set the partition to mount read-only for any user.\nIn general is it a bad idea to mount another operating systems core files anyways and just mount a separate partition to store documents for both systems.\nRelated document:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu help on mounting windows partitions\n\nA: Deleting files with only one operating system installed is no more or less difficult than with two. Just don't do it. Your windows partition will be obvious when you see it. If you really want to be sure then unmount it. You can also have Ubuntu mount it read only.\nI would have a look here\nIf you're referring to when installing the second operating system then that's pretty simple as well. The installer will be very clear about how it's installing itself to the drive by giving you a few options. It will ask if you want to share the drive with windows, replace windows or do \"something else\" which involves manually setting up your partitions but I don't advise you doing that unless you're an experienced user and know what you're doing. \nIn the end, if you back up your files like we all should be doing then you're fine. Make sure to back up your personal files before installing Ubuntu and then do regular backups weekly. Important things like legal documents, files for work, family pictures, etc. should be backed up when changes are made. \nTo learn more about backing up your files, check this out.\nMake sure to read the Ubuntu wiki section pertaining to installation as well.

I want to know if there is ever going to be a possibility that windows exe files will be able to run on linux without an emulator like wine. Is there some way of creating an api library that offers both those used by windows applications as well as those used by linux ones? What is preventing this from happening or why has it not happened yet? Wine seems to be able to run them without running a full install of windows, so while there may be some proprietary bits why can't there be a way of completely integrating it?\n\nA: No.\nThat would violate copyright. Even when Windows XP is considered abondoned the copyright on it and all its parts is still there as long there is Microsoft upholding that copyright. \nBesides that: we would also need a 100% compatible DX driver. Guess who owns the copyright on that? Microsoft. That would mean nVidia, AMD need to get permission to create a DX capable driver for their videocard.\nBesides that: why would we ever want that to happen? Ubuntu is an operating system with its own goals and direction. I myself would not want to have MS software in my system. It would defile our operating system with the same junk Windows already has.\nTo be more precise: the following DLL's are copyrighted to death: NTDLL (NT kernel functions), USER32 (core functionality for building simple user interfaces), KERNEL32 (memory management, input/output operations, and interrupts), GDI32 (Windows Graphics Device Interface), en ADVAPI (security and registry calls).  Without permissions to recreate these as open source versions all you get is a limped, broken clone. Recreate any of these and you can expect a cease and desist letter. \n", "Q: Run several xdotool commands in one line separated from each other I'm trying to run xdotool type word then xdotool key Return from Startup Aplications Preferences. \nBut if I use && or ;, xdotool evaluates it as continuation of input.\n\nA: Long story short:\nUse a script.\n#! /bin/sh\n# With some window selection magic, or a sleep \n# if you want to do that manually.\nxdotool type word\nxdotool key Return\n\nAnd put the path of the script in the Exec field.\n\nLong story:\nAccording to the xdotool manpage:\ntype\n       Supports newlines and tabs (ASCII newline and tab). \n       With respect to \"COMMAND CHAINING\", this command consumes the\n       remainder of the arguments and types them. That is, no commands can\n       chain after 'type'.\n\nCommand chaining via ; or & isn't possible, since that is shell syntax and Startup Applications doesn't support shell syntax. However, if all you wish to do is press Enter after typing something, there's a roundabout way to do so. \nWhen it says \"ASCII\" newline, it doesn't mean a bare \\n. And command substitution (xdotool type \"$(printf '\\n')\", say) eats trailing newlines. Following this xdotools forum post, I tried this:\nxdotool type \"$(printf 'date\\n ')\"\n\nAnd it worked. But it only works if there is some character after the \\n, and this obviously leaves a trailing space, which would not be what you want.\nI modified that to:\nxdotool type \"$(printf 'date\\n\\e ')\"\n\nAnd this works and leaves no trailing space. However, it might cause problems for those using Vi mode in their shell. \nThanks to @steeldriver's comments I figured out that this was due to me trying it out on the very terminal I was executing the commands on. Just a small gap between my pressing Enter and the xdotool command was enough for a single newline to be registered correctly. Thus:\nsleep 0.1; xdotool type $'date\\n'\n\nSo either extending the line by quoting it:\nxdotool type 'date\n'\n\nor using the shell interpretation as @steeldriver suggested looks like the right option.\nHowever, a script containing:\n#! /bin/sh\nsleep 1\nxdotool type date\nxdotool key Return\n\nin the Exec field worked fine. Indeed, I always recommend using a script for complex commands in a desktop file.\nYou can have a script with /usr/bin/xdotool in the shebang, but the manpage says \"script mode isn't fully fleshed out and may fall below your expectations\", so I stuck to bash scripts.\nI might have been seeing things, but in my first couple of tries, I had to put a (small) sleep between the type and key commands. That was an artifact of trying it out on the terminal that was executing the commands instead of another window.\n\nA: Seems to me the application is not parsing multiple commands, abut treating it as a single command.   As such make it a single command by wrapping it a shell call...\nbash -c 'xdotool type date; xdotool key Return'\n\nNow you can also do other shell things...\nbash -c 'xdotool type \"`date +\"%Y-%m-%d_%T`\"'\n\nNote that the \"date\" command used in that last includes a newline! and \"xdotool\" will output it.\nNOTE: if you are doing this as a keyboard macro I would also add a few more options to \"xdotool\" to make this work better...\nbash -c 'xdotool type --clearmodifiers -delay 0 \"`date +\"%Y-%m-%d_%T`\"'\n\n", "Q: Can't remove Libre office Ubuntu 14.04?

When we want to run a programs as root we use sudo, gksu, gksudo and etc. Now my question is how do we can run a Terminal as the root user in Terminal?\nI tried with using gksudo terminal and gksu terminal but nothing happens. and by running sudo terminal I get error sudo: terminal: command not found.\n\nA: The default terminal emulator on Ubuntu is the GNOME Terminal. It's located at /usr/bin/gnome-terminal and can be run with the gnome-terminal command.\nWhat You Really Want\nWhat you probably want is a shell running as root, as though it were produced from a root login (for example, with all the environment variables set for root rather than for your user).\nAssuming that's what you want, as steeldriver has suggested, just run:\nsudo -i\n\nYou'll have a root shell in which commands you enter will be run as root (without having to precede them with sudo).\nBut if you really want to run the graphical terminal emulator application as root, read on. I present two ways: with gksu/gksdo, and with the sudo command.\nWith gksu/gksudo\nSince you have the gksu  package installed, you can run gnome-terminal as root with either of:\ngksu gnome-terminal\n\ngksudo gnome-terminal\n(Since gksu is set to sudo-mode in Ubuntu by default, these should be equivalent.)\nRunning gnome-terminal as root without a controlling non-root terminal:\nVirtually every desktop environment provides a facility to run a command without having to open a terminal (which would then, if closed, usually cause the command to be terminated).\nThis is usually achieved with Alt+F2. A textbox labeled Run command (or similar) will appear and you can enter your command.\nFor example, it looks like this in Unity:\n\nAnd like this in MATE (GNOME Flashback/Fallback, Xfce, LXDE are similar):\n\nNote that this works with gksu and gksudo because they use a graphical authentication dialog. If you were to press Alt+F2 and run sudo ..., you would then be unable to interact with the password prompt.\nWith sudo\nIf you don't have the gksu package and you won't want to install it, you can use:\nsudo -H gnome-terminal\n\nThe -H flag is important because it sets the HOME environment variable to /root instead of your own user's home directory. You should not use sudo gnome-terminal as it can break the gnome-terminal configuration belonging to the non-root user. For more information about this, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*RootSudo on the Ubuntu help wiki\n\n*Why should users never use normal sudo to start graphical applications?\n(sudo -i gnome-terminal is also okay.)\nGetting rid of the controlling non-root terminal:\nIf you (1) open a graphical terminal, (2) run something like sudo -H gnome-terminal in it, to create a new graphical root terminal, and (3) quit the original non-root graphical terminal ...then the root graphical terminal quits as well.\nThis is because the root graphical terminal is sent SIGHUP when the terminal that owns it is exited.\nTo prevent this, you might think you could instead launch the graphical root terminal with:\nsudo -H gnome-terminal &\nBut this will only work if sudo doesn't have to prompt for a password. If it does, you won't see the password prompt.\nOne way to work around this is to use:\nsudo -v\nsudo -H gnome-terminal\n\nsudo -v exists for just this purpose. As explained in man sudo, it \"update[s] the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user if necessary.\"\nNote that this will still not work if run directly from your desktop environment's Alt+F2 \"run command\" box, because you still need a terminal to enter your password for sudo -v.\nOr you can do it in what might be called the traditional way, by suspending the job after it starts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo -H gnome-terminal from the original non-root graphical terminal.\n\n*Enter your password as prompted by sudo. The graphical terminal will start.\n\n*Still in the non-root terminal, press Ctrl+Z to suspend the root terminal. While the root terminal is suspended, you can't use it; its interface will not respond to your actions.\n\n*Quit the controlling non-root terminal with exit. The graphical root terminal job will be both unsuspended and disowned by the non-root terminal, automatically.\n\n\nIn short:\nsudo -H gnome-terminal\n^Z\nexit\n\nBut suppose you wanted to keep using the original, non-root terminal too. Then you could run bg N, where N is the graphical root terminal's job number, to resume the job in the background. You can run jobs to find N but you probably won't have to--that number was shown as [N] when you pressed Ctrl+Z. For example:\nek@Ilex:~$ sudo -H gnome-terminal\n[sudo] password for ek: \n^Z\n[1]+  Stopped                 sudo -H gnome-terminal\nek@Ilex:~$\n\nA: Short answer: \ngksudo gnome-terminal\n(assuming gksu is installed)\n\nopens a terminal as root:\nroot@jacob-Satellite-L300:~#\n\nNo need to explain that you can use this to open any terminal as root like this; like Vala (gksudo vala-terminal), Xterm (gksudo xterm), Termit (gksudo termit), UXTerm (gksudo uxterm), Konsole (gksudo konsole) and so on.\n\nA: As previously stated, you ask how to run Terminal as root, but more likely you actually want to run the graphical Terminal application as your normal user, and start a root shell inside it where you are logged on as root.  In this way the graphical terminal application is not granted root privileges.  The previous answers don't seem to give clear command lines to use so here's what I use.\nWith xterm\nxterm -bg black -fg red -e sudo -i\nThe '-e sudo -i' tells xterm to switch to root in the session, and the colours are just to make it very obvious that it's a root shell.\nWith Gnome Terminal\ngnome-terminal -- sudo -i\nPersonally, I bind Gnome keybindings to launch terminals easily\nGo to Keyboard settings, add a custom shortcut with Shortcut Super+X and command 'xterm -bg black -fg white -sb -sl 5000', and root xterm with Shortcut Super+Z and command 'xterm -bg black -fg red -sb -sl 5000 -e sudo -i'.\nIn the past I have tended to prefer xterm over Gnome Terminal because the font is small and simple, but I'm coming round to Terminal now I run high DPI big screens.  Colour coding your terminals is a very good idea once you start to run different profiles with dangerous consequences to avoid accidents (e.g. local root, remote client's machine, remote client root).\n\nA: That question sounds so simple that there must be a simple solution, right?Of course you can use gksudo or similar tools but there may be environments where you don't want to depend on GTK. It's confusing but a terminal is not a shell!\nThe terminal is that thing what shows you stuff, where the shell is the thing that has those fancy features like environment variables, conditionals and all that scripting stuff. That's why x-terminal-emulator -e ... just expects a program to run. No scripts possible here, it just starts a new process. When a terminal starts it just knows that there's some kind of screen showing you stuff and the input of your keyboard which pours directly in there.\nA shell delivers all the logic of a script language like eg. sh, bash, ash, zsh, ...!\nThe other important distinction is who is running the terminal and what shell is running inside it. You may run a terminal in the context of an ordinary user which runs a root shell inside of it but this has some disadvantages eg. when you start a new tab a new shell is spawned but it falls back to the privileges of an ordinary user. Your command of a 'New shell please' goes to the terminal and not the shell!A disappointment when you realize that you have to enter all those sudo stuff once again for every tab you open.\nNow, is there a way to open a terminal and not a shell as root without using packages like gksudo? Expecting a debian context:\nbash -c \"xhost +si:localuser:root; ssh-askpass | sudo -S -Hb /usr/bin/xfce4-terminal --default-working-directory=/root\"\nAlthough it looks simple a lot stuff is happening here:\n\n*\n\n*allow root to access the X desktop of the current user.\n\n*since sudo requires a tty, we avoid that by running ssh-askpass which runs\nin the context of the current user and asks for your pass.\n\n*sudo now reads that pass from the stdin (-S), it set's the home folder (-H)  and spawns a new process detaching from our context (-b).\n\n*and finally sets the terminal process' default home folder to root to avoid landing in the home of the current user.\n\net voilà!\nYou have a terminal running as root spawned in the context of the current user. Now when you spawn a new tab it's happening inside the root terminal instead of the user who spawned it.\nAttention!\nThere's is a reason why this stuff is so complicated. Keep in mind in whatever X|VNC|RDP session you are running it. It just keeps a terminal open. That's the downside! If someone is able to capture your session (however likely it may be), root access is for free! Your decision.\n\nA: There's another way to do this, tested and working on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:\nFirst install gnome-panel:\nsudo apt install gnome-panel\n\nThen install gksu:\nsudo apt install gksu\n\nAfter installation is complete, run:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\n\nThis creates a desktop shortcut. You should have the option to name it. I called mine 'X-Term' but you can call yours pretty much whatever you want. Type in /usr/bin/gksu* for the 'Command' path. \nWhen you launch your new desktop shortcut you will be prompted for an application to run. Type in: xterm.\nYou will now be prompted for your password; once you enter it you'll have access to a working root terminal. Remember to use only when absolutely necessary and close down when you're finished with it. \n*assuming you installed Ubuntu with default settings and haven't changed any of the file-systems significantly since installation.\n\nA: I'm using Debian 9 stretch\nGo to keyboard shortcuts, add a command like this:\n`gksu /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator'\nI had put Super + T as shortcut.\nNow everytime that you wanna open a terminal as root, just type you shortcut\nI hope it may help someone in the future\n\nA: You can start an interactive shell with:\nsudo -s\n\nFor more information do:\nman sudo\n\nand read the -s --shell section.\n", "Q: Install Script Question Sorry if this has been discussed, wasn't sure what to use to search for the particular question I had.\nI'm installing sickrage and couchpotato and headphones, and will be doing multiple installs I made a small batch script just to install everything but what I don't know how to do is automatically make them auto start on boot.

Windows Loader points to GRUB2, from which I then start Ubuntu up. The 20 seconds count that I mentioned earlier starts AFTER I select Ubuntu 14.04.1 from the GRUB2 menu.\nAny help is appreciated.\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I have only one partition for / and /home. I intend on using a shared NTFS drive for my documents and other personal files, so I had no need for the /home. I did not make a /swap since I have 12 GB of RAM. I also did not make a /boot since I was told that it's not really necessary in my case.\n\nA: Nvm, I figured it out. Turns out a USB SD card reader that I had plugged in was causing that delay.

Most of these are dependant on your screen and ANSI color specification. If you use a good terminal emulator, you might be able to set custom RGB colors for certain ANSI color codes.\nBash as a shell is powerless as to what the screen can do with displays. It only passes the words on the terminal into your screen. The screen can decide what to do with it. The screen can decide what colors the ANSI escape codes represent (if the terminal even allows colors).\nA workaround is to change the terminal color specs. However, very few (I don't know any) will allow you to change colors.\n\nA: You need vte >= 0.36 for true colors to work in gnome-terminal. Make sure your vte is recent enough, and in that case your code should work.\n(Note: when you output hard-coded strings, as you do in your example application, the value of $TERM is necessarily absolutely irrelevant. It only matters if you're using libraries whose behavior depends on this, such as ncurses.)\n", "Q: installation Ubuntu 14.01 on a different partition with Windows 8.1 Please assist me.

If it doesn't, you have to manually partition, which isn't hard at all for someone like me, but I use Gentoo, so that's different. Anyways, if the Ubuntu installer cannot detect windows paritions, you will have to click on the options that is under \"Install Ubuntu\" which is called \"Something Else\", after you click that, you will have to make the Windows Partition smaller to make room for Ubuntu, I suggest >40GB. Then you will make a new parition, which you will have to set as ext4 or btrfs, and choose the / mount point. If you are low on RAM, leave an extra 4 - 8 GB to partition as swap. \n", "Q: Graphical disk surface check tool?

There is no set time for when they move the data from the archives to the old-releases page, but they do eventually get around to it.

You didn't specify how much you are familiar with command line in your original question, so just in case you're not, nano is a command line text editor.

And how do I fix it (if there's even anything actually broken)?\n\nA: There is probably nothing really wrong.\nSimple answer: apt-get and aptitude have different dependency resolvers (how-do-i-fix-these-broken-dependencies).\nTo see if there is actually an issue you can run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall foomatic-db-compressed-ppds xz-lzma\n\nPersonally, I would advise against using aptitude as it can sometimes be dangerous. \napt-get is much safer and will not install with broken packages in place, however, apt-get is rarely, if ever, able to to fix an impossible situation because of broken packages. aptitude does have ability to fix broken packages but aptitude also has the ability to create a situation where broken packages exist.\nA happy medium is synaptic. synaptic has more ability to fix broken packages than apt-get but does not have quite the ability of aptitude to create such a situation.\nSources: how-do-i-fix-these-broken-dependencies\n", "Q: Unable to NFS mount from Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS against QNAP NAS Note, this is a cross posting question in the QNAP NAS community here: http://forum.qnap.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=96526&p=427018#p427018\nAny comments and suggestions, as well as pointers to relevant information pieces are very appreciated.\n\nI cannot NFS mount from my NFS client running Ubuntu 14.04.1 (LTS) against my NFS server (QNAP NAS). My environment is:\n\n\n*\n\n*NFS Server: QNAP TS-669 Pro running firmware 4.1.0 (dated: 2014/06/12)\n\n*NFS Client: ECS LIVA (a small barebone PC) running Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS Desktop.\n\n*The two systems are connected via 1000Base-T Ethernet and IP reacheable.\n\n*Name resolution is done by local registry (/etc/hosts) and getent hosts host-name command returns the correct and consistent IP address on both nodes.\n\n*NFS service is enabled on the NFS server and NO_LIMIT access right is given on the specific share folder, namely \"/nfs\", on the \"NFS host access\" tab of the \"Shared Folders\" configuration app: in fact, I can confirm it is world NFS exported via issueing the \"exportfs -rva\" command on NAS.\n\n*Because Ubuntu (the NFS client) does not install NFS client packages by default, I explicitly installed the nfs-common package as described in here: Setting Up NFS HOW-TO ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo#NFS_Client ); The rpcbind package seems to be installed by default.\n\n\nOn the NFS client, If I run the command \"mount -t nfs nas:/nfs /mnt\", it gives the output \"mount.nfs: Connection timed out\" after five or 10 minutes later. The same result is returned even if I specify NFS version 3 protocol with -overs=3 option while trying to NFS mount.\nAlso the command \"showmount -e\" lists up the exported NFS shared folder (directory) names eventually, but it also takes five or 10minutes to complete.\nOn the NFS server, the \"exportfs -rva\" command returns the following warning message, but I do believe the message does not relate with the problem (I am accessing the NAS via SSH in this code exmple):\n[~] # exportfs -rva\nexportfs: /etc/exports [1]: Neither 'subtree_check' or 'no_subtree_check' specified for export \"*:/share/MD0_DATA/Public\".\nAssuming default behaviour ('no_subtree_check').

Currently, for all my commands that require root access, I have to type them out on a command line.\nI would like for the GUI to prompt me to key in my password, when sudo is required, instead of having to type out the commands from command line.\nIs there any way to enable this? Previously one version of Ubuntu desktop had this feature out of the box.\nThis version of Ubuntu (that I am now running) I upgraded from a server installation.\nI will add, my user account is already added to sudo group. Thus I can run commands such as sudo gedit or sudo apt-get but I'm not able to install software in the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: A convenient way is to create a dedicated .desktop file, or add your commands to an existing one, asking your password via GUI (gksu). In the example below, I add the command to run Gedit and Software Center with sudo privileges to the Gedit launcher. You will need to have gksu installed to use this setup: sudo apt-get install gksu\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the Gedit .desktop file in/usr/share/applications/to~/.local/share/applications`:\ncp /usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/gedit.desktop\n\nand open it for editing (drag it onto an open gedit window)\n\n*Look for the line: Actions=Window;Document;\n\n*Add the names of your commands to the line (these are not the names you will see in your interface, only used for internal reference in the file)\nActions=Window;Document;gedit;Ubuntu Software Center;\n\n\n*Add the corresponding sections at the bottom of the file:\n[Desktop Action gedit]\nName=Gedit  (with gksu)\nExec=gksudo gedit\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n[Desktop Action Ubuntu Software Center]\nName=Ubuntu Software Center (with gksu)\nExec=gksudo /usr/bin/software-center\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n\n*Close the file and drag it onto the launcher\nNow you can run gedit and Software Center with sudo privileges:\n\n\n\nA: TL;DR: Try installing the policykit-1 and policykit-1-gnome packages.\nYou probably need polkit (a.k.a. PolicyKit).\nMost graphical system administration utilities in Ubuntu, including the Software Center, can usually be run without sudo or anything quite like it. You just run them the same way you'd run any program.\nWhen it comes time to perform a task requiring root privileges, they use polkit to perform the required actions. polkit is a separate mechanism from sudo, for allowing administrators to perform actions as root. It's installed on desktop Ubuntu systems but by default is not part of Ubuntu Server installations.\nThus the normal behavior of the Software Center is that you can invoke it simply as software-center, it will not prompt you to authenticate at that time, but then when you tell it to install or remove software, it will prompt you (graphically) to authenticate.\nIt sounds from your description like your system started as an Ubuntu Server system with no GUI, and then you installed a GUI. Probably the policykit-1  and policykit-1-gnome  packages have not been installed. If you install the, polkit will most likely start working for Software Center and other such utilities.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install policykit-1 policykit-1-gnome\n\nThen you should be able to just run:\nsoftware-center\n\n(Or select the Software Center graphically as provided for by whatever desktop environment you installed.)\nIf you want a fully functional Ubuntu desktop system, I recommend installing the metapackage for whatever \"flavor\" of Ubuntu you want to turn your system into. Basically, if you want a regular Ubuntu desktop system, install ubuntu-desktop .\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis should fill in the various gaps, like not having polkit, that come with installing a more minimal GUI on your server system. On the other hand, if you prefer a more minimal GUI, you can just install those polkit packages.\nFor more information, see How do you run Ubuntu Server with a GUI?\nsudo with graphical authentication.\nIf you really do need run commands as root but get a graphical authentication dialog, what you're looking for is gksudo (or gksu). This is provided by the gksu  package. It is a graphical frontend for sudo.\nTypically gksudo is used to run graphical applications as root (or some other user besides the user launching them). But you can also use it to run non-graphical commands--provided the commands can be run with sudo.\nYou can run gksudo from a terminal but you don't have to. You can run it from the Alt+F2 (run command) dialog or put it in the Exec= line of a .desktop file (or any of the other ways you run graphical programs).\nNote that you should consider using gksudo to run graphical applications as root even when you are running them from a terminal, because commands like sudo ... where ... is a graphical application can actually break the per-application configurations of the non-root users running them. (Fortunately this is fixable.)  sudo gedit is particularly notorious.\nFor more information on the problem with sudo for graphical applications and what to do instead, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why should users never use normal sudo to start graphical applications?\n\n*RootSudo in the Ubuntu help wiki\n\n*man sudo for the -H and -i options. sudo -H ... and sudo -i ... do not authenticate graphically, but like gksudo ... they don't have the problems of plain sudo ....\n\n\nThere's also polkit-based graphical way ...for non-graphical commands.\ngksudo works fine for running both graphical and non-graphical programs. You should probably use that.\nBut an alternative, using polkit instead of sudo and only working for non-graphical programs, is pkexec.\nFor example, if you run pkexec touch /root/foo.txt, you'll be prompted with a graphical authentication dialog, and if the authentication succeeds, touch /root/foo.txt is run, creating (or freshening) foo.txt in the /root folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*pkexec will use a non-graphical dialog, requiring a terminal, in the event that it cannot create a graphical dialog. But this is unlikely to happen if you're running it through a facility provided by your graphical shell or desktop environment.\n\n*Why does pkexec work only for non-graphical programs? Actually it also runs graphical programs, but only if polkit has been specially configured to allow it--which is not usually done. See man pkexec (and the upstream version, with screenshots), this answer and that answer for some details, if you're interested.\n\n\nsudo vs. polkit (some technical details, only if you're interested)\nA new gksu/gksudo will use polkit instead of sudo to do its work, though this version has not been widely adopted. I mainly bring it up to recommend the README file in its source code (written by Gustavo Noronha Silva), which explains the important differences between sudo and polkit. To quote from it briefly:\n\nPolicyKit solves the problem of an application needing higher\n  privileges by providing facilities to let users authenticate\n  themselves and for applications to verify authentication and\n  authorization information. The application has to be structured in a\n  way that all privileged operation is done by a (preferably) small\n  D-Bus service, which is commanded by the unprivileged code. All\n  \"actions\" that are performed need proper authorization, which is\n  handled through Policykit.\n4. Why maintain gksu?\nSo, this essentially makes gksu unnecessary, since applications no\n  longer need to run as a privileged user, and user authentication is\n  done by PolicyKit's Auth Agent. But applications need to be refactored\n  to adopt this new structure, and there are some cases in which what\n  you want is indeed something that runs programs as root.\n\nThese issues underlie the situation I believe you're in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software Center is designed to use polkit for privilege elevation, so that only specific actions need to be performed as root. For this, it needs polkit, which was missing (or broken) on your system.\n\n*Because it is designed to use polkit, there's no pre-made launcher to start the Software Center as root. polkit obviates the need to run graphical administration tools as root, most of the time.\n\n*But sometimes you really do need to run a graphical program as root. In that case, you can use gksu/gksudo.\n(...Which may eventually use polkit behind the scenes--but the gksudo currently in Ubuntu is the traditional one that uses sudo).\n\n\nA: gksu has been deprecated.\nIt's been removed from Ubuntu 18.04, as well as Debian and other newer Linux distributions. If you do a web search with the phrase \"Ubuntu man gksu\", you will see there's no 18.04 version available.

But I can't found the PPA.\nIs there any PPA is available to install Deepin DE v2 to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?\n\nA: If you would like to use the software lists just as described in the tutorial, all you have to do is change all instances of the word raring to trusty.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, open the /etc/apt/sources.list file in an open terminal with the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAdd the following lines:\ndeb http://packages.linuxdeepin.com/deepin trusty main non-free universe\ndeb-src http://packages.linuxdeepin.com/deepin trusty main non-free universe\n\nUse Ctrl+o to write changes to the file and press Enter to accept the changes. Press Ctrl+x to exit from nano.\n\n*Now you need to import GPG key and install using the following three commands in an open terminal:\nwget http://packages.linuxdeepin.com/deepin/project/deepin-keyring.gpg\ngpg --import deepin-keyring.gpg\nsudo gpg --export --armor 209088E7 | sudo apt-key add -\n\n\n*Update your package list:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*You may now proceed with the remainder of the tutorial to install the desired packages.\n\nJust to let you know, this is not how to install a \"ppa\". Installing a ppa essentially provides an alternative repo to your apt-get sources list. However, ppa(s) are provided through launchpad and are maintained by third parties. The method outlined above directly adds the repo to your /etc/apt/sources.list file instead. Normally, to add a ppa you would use the command:\nsudo add-apt-repository\n\nfollowed by ppa: and the name of the ppa.\nNoobslab maintains a third party ppa for Deepin but they are not affiliated with the Deepin project, and so I will not recommend that method, as there is already a direct method available to add the Deepin repositories without the use of a ppa.\nlaunchpad.net/~noobslab/+archive/ubuntu/deepin-sc\n", "Q: Compiling custom kernel with Ubuntu patches I have compiled my own custom kernel but it uses a modified source from github.

How can I do this without getting all rm -r happy? I'm preferably looking for a way to do this without installing any new packages, as my main goal is to get rid of excess stuff on my machine. I'd like to find a way to do this preferably with dpkg, or apt.\n\nA: As regards actually installed languages, go to System Settings -> Language Support and click the Install / Remove Languages... button. Then uncheck the languages you don't need.\nAs regards the symlinks in /usr/share/help, please see my comment on your question.\n\nA: An easy way to do this is by using BleachBit. BleachBit is able to remove files for unwanted languages in your system and applications.\nInstall BleachBit from your Ubuntu Software or terminal (sudo apt install bleachbit) and open it as root (sudo bleachbit). Go to Preferences and under Languages check all the languages you want to keep. Now on the left panel, under System, check Localizations. If you want to know how much space these localization files are taking up in your system, click the Preview button. Use the Clean button to actually free up the space. Hope this helps.\nIn the screenshot, you can see BleachBit deleting localization files from gedit text editor.\nBleachBit screenshot\n\nA: You can check which locales are generated and configured on your system using the locale command:\n\n\n*\n\n*locale ... list the current locale configuration\n\n*locale -a ... lists all all locales that were generated on your system\n\n*locale -a -v ... list all locales and show useful additional information (such as directory names that contain the locale information data files)\n\n\nThe last command from above makes you see that all generated locales are located in /usr/lib/locale/, you may remove any of them if unneeded. Each pack of locale information is a directory containing text files and other directories.\nAll locales that you want your system to support are listed in the text files in /var/lib/locales/supported.d/. These files have two columns, language tag and character map.\nI want my system to know US-English only, so I have only one file there, called en, which contains just a single line:\nen_US UTF-8\n\nError messages\nIf error messages are displayed when issuing the locale command, e.g:\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\n\nmake sure the file /etc/default/locale exists and has proper content, such as:\nLANG=\"en_US\"\nLANGUAGE=\"en_US:en\"\n\nGet rid of unneeded locale data - Step by step\nNow we know all the necessary details to get started with cleaning up our system's locale information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the locale file(s) in /var/lib/locales/supported.d/, and remove all unneeded locales (one locale per line)\n\n*Create and edit /etc/default/locale (see above for an example)\n\n*Delete all generated locale data: rm -rfv /usr/lib/locale/*\n\n*Re-generate new locales: locale-gen\nThat's all!

The problem:  After setting Window spreading to on in Unity Tweak Tool, Unity will crash on trying to initiate the Window spread/Scale Compiz effect.  This results in the Unity panel and launcher, as well as window decorations disappearing.  How does one fix this issue and stop it from happening?\n\nA: I was able to work around and fix this problem.  I've seen the same problem as well on Ubuntu 14.04. It seems to be caused by how Unity Tweak Tool handles configuring \"Window spreading.\" (I suspect that it doesn't eliminate a conflict between scale and something in Desktop Wall plugin).  Scale in compiz will do \"Window Spreading\" without crashing if you enable it there in CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager) rather than using Unity Tweak Tool to do it.\nFirst, what you can do without resetting everything right after the crash (some right-clicking and double-clicking still works on desktop in the cases I have seen) is to right-click on desktop, and create a new text file. Right-click on the icon and make it executable using the Properties you can get by right-clicking on the icon and going to the Permissions tab, and put a check in the 'Allow executing file as program' checkbox. (If you cannot do even these you might be able to Ctrl-Alt-F1 to console, logon, and issue sudo killall Xorg or issue sudo service lightdm restart, and you should be dropped back at the greeter to log back on and start over--or you can Ctrl-Alt-F7, if not).\nNext, double-click the icon you created and click Display to open the file with the default text editor.  Put in the file as follows:\nunity --replace\n\nNow save the file.\nThen, double-click the file you created, click the Run button in the dialog that should come up, and Unity should be back up and running in a few moments.  Any time Unity crashes you can double-click that icon to bring it back up while you do the following to work around the issue.\nFinally, open up CCSM (Compiz) and Unity Tweak Tool.  Turn off Window spread and close Unity Tweak Tool. Go over to Scale plugin in CCSM, and enable it. As soon as you do that, you will get a notice about a conflict between that plugin and something in Desktop Wall (or another plugin, depending upon where the plugin conflict actually is on your machine. Choose to resolve the conflict and choose to disable the conflicting compiz plugin. Then you can go to the Bindings tab and set your hot corner for (screen icon) Initiate Window Picker (Super-w may already be set, but if not you can set it).  Close CCSM.  Trash the icon you created on the desktop, when done.\nAfter doing this I no longer am seeing the crash, no matter how many times I use the Window Spreading/Scale effect, even while writing this (had to try it a few times just to see if I could make it crash while I was writing this--yeah, living on the edge).\nThe issue isn't in Unity but rather in how Unity Tweak Tool fails to resolve a Compiz plugin conflict when setting Window Spreading. It sets things for the Scale effect but doesn't handle the conflict and disable it.  Someone probably should let the developer of Unity Tweak Tool know about that issue.\nHope this helps those experiencing this same crash.\n", "Q: Disable bluetooth in Kubuntu 14.04 Does anyone know how to permanently disable bluetooth in Kubuntu 14.04? \n\nA: You can write a simple script and load it on start-up to disable bluetooth permanently.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your editor using gksudo kate and copy this in it.\n#!/bin/bash \nrfkill block bluetooth\n\n*Save it under /etc/init.d with <any_name>.sh.\n\n*Now make it executable using sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/<script_name>.sh.\n\n*Now use following command sudo update-rc.d\n/etc/init.d/<script_name>.sh defaults.\n\n\nIt will disable your bluetooth on system startup.\n\nA: Better try and type  this in your terminal\nrfkill block bluetooth\n\nHope it disables the bluetooth\nfor unblocking use\nrfkill unblock bluetooth\n\nIf it shows access denied to rfkill then use\nsudo rfkill block bluetooth\n\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu-12.10-desktop along with windows 8 64bit I have hp pavilion 15 n204tx, which came with pre-installed Ubuntu OS.\nI formatted it and installed Win 8 64bit.\nand created 3 + 1(system reserve) partition.\n        50GB for win8\n        50GB for Ubuntu\n        remaining for my files\n        and other is system reserve.\n\nBut now i need ubuntu-12.10-desktop also, along with win8.\nIs there is a way to install ubuntu-12.10-desktop, without affecting my files and win8 on second 50GB partition.\nIs the installation method is same as of  other similar questions here.\nPlease answer and i don't know anything about commands posted on other answers here, i just started to learn UNIX.\nSo kindly tell where and how to use commands, if any\nThank you\n\nA: You can install ubuntu or any linux distribution without affecting files in other partition. Here is the link how you can install ubuntu alongside windows\nhttp://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2013/09/install-ubuntu-linux-alongside-windows.html?m=1\n\nA: Ubuntu is nice at installing alongside another os. During the installation it will ask about win8 or partitions. At this point select your ubuntu partition, make some of this swap, the remaining the root of your filesystem (/). All should go ok. Two points, firstly i would resequence your partitions for microsoft's sake go for something like this.\nWindows c:\nMore windows partitions.\nSwap (about 2-3 times RAM i think)\nUbuntu (root i.e. /)\nUser data (/home)\nRecovery partition.\nSecondly win8 machines have a bios option to only allow ms win8 on this machine, this needs to be set to allow another os.\n\nA: Step 1:\na) Go To the Link: http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.10/\nb) Download and Save suitable .iso image in locale drive\nc) Create bootable USB/ DVD drive: for USB use \"Startup Disc Creator\", for DVD just burn the image using any burner like \"K3B\"\nStep 2:\nInsert USB/DVD Device > Reboot > Enter BIOS Setput > Set Boot Device Priority > Save & Exit\nStep 3:\nInstall Ubuntu OS > Select \"Install Ubuntu Along Side Windows\" > Reboot & Verify\n", "Q: Can't I open an app without a keyboard? Any application which is not locked in the Launcher can be opened via searching for it. But how do I open an application without the help of the keyboard? That is, without typing in the search field.\nIs there no way whatsoever in the entire of Ubuntu operating system to open an app with only the mouse (or any other non-keyboard device for that matter)?\nThere has to be something like a response-accessibly central menu or something.\n\nA: It can be done completely without a keyboard (only mouse).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Dash, click on the applications icon (at the bottom of Dash)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The first row shows most recent, below are installed applications\n\n*Click on \"See more results\" to see all installed applications\n\n*Scroll up/down to see them all\nToo many? Filter the applications by category; in the right top: Filter Results\n\n\nA: Well, there are two great apps in the Ubuntu Software Center. One of them is ClassicMenu indicator, which is a drop down menu with all the programs installed and sorted by categories, sort of like Windows XP Start Menu. Another one is GNOME Do, which is basically a search menu for apps. Both are located under Accessories category. I've installed both, both look great, but my verdict would be to give ClassicMenu a try. there you just use mouse to get to whatever app you need and no typing involved.\n", "Q: How to remove encrypted ubuntu 14.04 OS from SSD I installed ubuntu 14.04 LTS but I've decided its not for me.\nDuring the install I was prompted to use disk encryption and I chose to do so and I had to Use a Passpharse to unlock the SSD prior to login. \nI couldnt find a way to remove this before so I re-installed ubuntu without incryption and it prompted me that it would Format the SSD and I would Lose everything that was on it(which is what I wanted anyways) but, it seems after the re-install was done. there was a protion of the SSD that was not deleted.

My drive with this grub.cfg and EFI folder has the /boot/grub on the fith partition and is a gpt drive - so gpt5 seems ok.\nhd8 seems odd, as I do boot this drive I would have expected it to be hd0.\nAnd the uuid I thought it should be the one of the gpt5 partition, but maybe this should be the drives uuid?!\nCould someone please explain what is happening here and what the correct values for /boot/grub on a fitht partition of a gpt drive should be?

The Exec field expects an executable file and (optionally) can pass parameters to it. In fact, %U isn't the only thing that is supported.

Whenever I try to install it it says \"No root file system found. Please correct this error from the partitioning menu.\" I've tried to create new partitions but I don't know what size to make them etc. can someone please help me on this? (Is there a way to create partitions through the terminal? I'm new to ubuntu) but i was on it 2 days ago, laptops crashed and now I can't get past the installation. I've created a new  partitioning table just need guidance on which partitions to create and how big to make them. I have absolutely no partitions whatsoever on my hard drive (or whatever the partitions are part of) so it will need to be from the very start. Thanks in advance! \n\nA: You only need 2 partitions, make a swap partiton of about 3 GB and make the rest of the space formatted as ext4 and mounted as /.\nThis is the simpelist way to set it up.\nFirst delete anything on the disk make it all empty space.\nThen make a new partition and set format to swap and size to 3000 and accept this.\nNow make another new partition and set format to ext4, mount point to / and type to primary. Dont change the size.\nNow apply these settings and install\n\nA: I recommend you to create the partitions throughout the installation process (but you could use something like GParted Live too). Just choose the 'Something else' option when you have to choose where you want your operating system to be installed and then select the 'New partition' option.\nI think you have an EFI BIOS so you need a /boot/efi partition as well.\nIf you want to have a Linux only system: \n\n\n*\n\n*200MB partition primary, mount point: /boot/efi\n\n*15GB partition primary, ext4 file system, mount point: / \n\n*308.024 MB logical partition, ext4 file system, mount point: /home \n\n*partition primary 4096 MB used as swap\nP.S.: Set a flag to format them.\n", "Q: Nvidia x server setting no specific option I just freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04 and did only 4 things:\n1)\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-340\n2) \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates nvidia-settings-updates\n\n3) Went to Software & Updates/Additional drivers and chosen\n\nUsing NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.32 from nvidia-340 (open source)\n\nI had to do part 3 because after part 1 I had driver version 304\nNow to the main part.

I can view a dropdown menu telling me about the network map and control panel but no browser to surf the tor network with. Is it because it's a new version and using firefox normally is basically the same thing, because everything is now going through the tor network that way? Probably I need to alter something or download the Browser separately?\nThanks \n\nA: For some reason you need to download the web browser which isn’t in the Ubuntu Software Center.

My question is on the title. All my Ubuntu installations (12.04, 13.10 and 14.04) receive significantly weaker wi-fi signals, compared to the pre-installed w8 system on the same machine. Do I need to seek for adapter driver software? if so, where can I find it?\n\nA: \nMany wireless card manufacturers support only Windows or Mac OS platforms. When developing drivers to integrate the hardware with the operating system, they focus solely on these platforms. This leaves Linux-based distros on their own.\nSome wireless vendors release the specs to the open source community so they can write drivers for Linux, while other drivers are reverse-engineered by the community. Because there's no official support, some of these drivers can be quite buggy. For my desktop running Ubuntu 10.04, I just simply gave up and ran an ethernet cable up the stairs from the router.\nHowever, there are wireless cards that work well with Ubuntu. When deciding to run Ubuntu or some other Linux distro on a computer, it helps to select hardware known to be Linux-compatible.\nUbuntu's Help Docs - Wireless Cards Supported lists all of the wireless cards by vendor and then by model. It will tell you if the card is supported, how well it works, what it takes to install and configure the drivers, and how to troubleshoot.\nIn my experience, using cards that work out of the box are best. Not only is installation easier, but the cards generally continue to work as you update your system.\n\nSource\n", "Q: Create full folder structure from \"New document\" (Templates) menu If I create a folder inside Templates, when I click \"new Document\" > \"myfolder\" it does nothing.  That is just a sub directory to organize the templates.\nBut maybe it would be useful to create that folder hierarchy. For instance:\nI have all these files and folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/template/tm1.txt \n\n*~/template/tm2.txt\n\n*~/template/myfolder/\n\n*~/template/myfolder/subfolder/\n\n*~/template/myfolder/subfolder/hello1.html\n\n*~/template/myfolder/subfolder/hello2.html\n\n*~/template/myfolder/subfolder/hello3.html\n\n*~/template/myfolder/index.html\n\n\nSo when I click \"new Document\" > \"myfolder\" I'd like to create \"myfolder\" with \"subfolder\" and index.html (etc....).\nIs there any way to do this?\nI know that \"new Document\" isn't the same as \"new folder\", but maybe this should be called \"new template\".\n\nA: I don't think this is possible via the Templates menu but you could create a Nautilus script to achieve the same. Something akin to the following should work:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Create folder structure from template\n\nTemplateDir=\"$HOME/Folder templates/dir1\"\nWorkingDir=\"$PWD\"\n\ncp -r \"$TemplateDir\" \"$WorkingDir/\"\n\nPlace your folder with subfolders and files in ~/Folder templates and modify the TemplateDir line accordingly. Then follow these instructions to install the script.\nWhen you're done, right click on an empty area in your Nautilus window and select Scripts → your script name. This should create a copy of your template directory in the current folder.\n\nA: I have a Nautilus extension that hopefully does what you're looking for.  See the following website:\nnautilus-new-folder-from-template\nThis extension allows you to create directory-templates, and choose from among them using the right-click context menu.\n", "Q: Xchat unable to connect I am using Xubuntu 12.04.4 LTS.\nI have been trying to connect to freenode IRC server through Xchat application but I am getting the following error:\n Looking up irc.freenode.net\n* Connecting to chat.freenode.net (38.229.70.20) port 8001...\n* Connected.

It makes sense. It's distracting.\n\nThe Solution\n\nMethod 1: Using a VPN\nProxies/VPNs are the greatest friends of students and employees trying to skip content filtering systems. However, many places have policies against using proxies/VPNs which can get you suspended or fired, respectively. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR JOB LOSS. There are many ways to implement a proxy/VPN:\nMethod 1a: Using a Rented/Free VPN\nMany times, you can just use a rented or free VPN to do the job quickly and easily.  Simply find one you like, type it in as the system VPN (network settings), and you're good to go! Some good ones I've heard about are FreeVPN.me and VPNBook. Your milage may vary.\nMethod 1b: Using your home PC\nIf you have server skills, you can set up a VPN at home to host stuffs. However, this may cause issues. Namely, slow internet and packet loss. There are many ways to do this, and there are too many to list here. Google \"How to host a vpn server ubuntu\" and you'll get ~730,000 results.\nMethod 1c: Using DD-WRT\nIf you have DD-WRT, you can set up a proxy server at your home. The relevant options are under Services > VPN. Choose PPTP or OpenVPN, they both work well at giving you your IRC fix.\n\nMethod 2: Find a way around\nMost places I've worked or learned only had hostname/port blocking. Try using weird port numbers that are allowed, as well as using IP addresses. There is usually SOME combination that works. (My old school completely blocked HTTPS after seeing how that allows you to jump out of the filter).\n\n\nMethod 3: Visit your SysAdmin\nChances are, your sysadmin is human. You can go talk to him and try to get him to unblock IRC. He might just do it. Also, most IT guys are suckers for free lunches. Bring him a lunch. You'll be on his good side FAST. IT guys are usually nice anyways. Your mileage might vary though.\n\nMethod 4: Online IRC\nJust use a web-IRC client. No software, no mess. And the best part is, you can just use those free online proxies to get at em.\n\nMethod 5: STOP COMPLAINING\nThere is obviously a reason why IRC is blocked. Just do your work and get your paycheck. IRC at home.\n", "Q: GRUB is not Booting Correctly I have a PC with three hard disks.  Windows 7 is installed on the first, Ubuntu 14.04 is installed on the third.  After I re-booted, it went straight to Windows 7.  So I tried explicitly telling my PC to boot using the third hard disk, but that just takes me to the grub rescue prompt.\nI followed Scott Severence's instructions here to try and recover.  Essentially, I updated grub, reinstalled grub, and then updated it again.  After re-booting, absolutely nothing had changed.\nSo instead I tried using the boot-repair tool.  In the past it had failed for me, saying that I had programs running and it could not unmount drives, when I was running nothing.  I never figured out how to solve that problem, but it went away when I bought another hard drive and used that for my Ubuntu installation, I don't know why.\nIn any case, I ran the boot-repair tool and this time it said it was successful.  First time for everything right?  I re-booted, only to be taken straight to the grub rescue prompt.  So I changed my BIOS settings to use the third hard disk for boot start up.  That is the same hard drive where I have Ubuntu and grub installed, and the same one that the grub-repair tool told me to use.  It still took me straight to the grub rescue prompt.  So I went from not being able to boot Ubuntu, to not being able to boot either OS installed on my system.  Thanks boot-repair!\nBoot repair gave me this URL for future troubleshooting:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/8131669\nWhen I try to boot from the third hard disk, this is my console:\nLoading Operating System ...\nerror: attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0'.\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrub rescue> \ngrub rescue> set\ncmdpath=(hd0)\nprefix=(hd0,gpt2)/boot/grub\nroot=hd0,gpt2\ngrub rescue> ls\n(hd0) (hd0,gpt3) (hd0,gpt2) (hd0,gpt1) (hd1) (hd2) (hd2,gpt2) (hd2,gpt1) (hd3)\n\nThose values look correct to me.  I have also experimented with changing some of those values, but 'insmod normal' always throws the same error.\nSomebody please tell me how to fix this.  I have tried everything, reinstalling grub, and running boot-repair.\n===========================\nUpdate: I think the problem might be that the ubuntu installer did not partition my hard disk correctly.  I booted from live USB and then launched gparted and looked at how it partitioned things.  This is what gparted says:\nPartition, File System, Size, Used, Unused, Flags\n/dev/sda1 (!), unknown, 1.00 MiB, ---, ---, bios_grub\n/dev/sda2, ext4, 2.71 TiB, 47.30 GiB, 2.67 TiB,\n/dev/sda3, linux-swap, 16.00 GiB, 0.00 B, 16.00 GiB,\n\nSo that first line looks problematic.  It is supposed to be the /boot partition.  However, it was given only 1 MiB?  I am assuming that MiB is actually supposed to mean megabyte, no idea why that 'i' is there.  It also says the file system is unknown.\nI read the answer by andrew here, and he says he had to do a custom install, explicitly configuring the boot partition.  So I think that maybe Ubuntu's installer has a bug in it, where it does not set up the boot partition correctly if you are not installing on the first hard disk in your computer.\nI am going to try reinstalling with a custom partition scheme.  I read elsewhere (askubuntu won't let me post another link) that I don't even need a /boot partition any more.  So instead of following Andrew's instructions ver batim, I'm first going to try having just two partitions: one for /, and another for my 16GB swap space.  Both as primary partitions.  The first will be formatted as ext4.  If that doesn't work, I may try again using /boot.\n========================\nSo I did my custom install with no /boot partition, and it did not work.  When I rebooted, I had an error message saying that some address did not exist.  So for the hundredth time, I booted from the live USB, and ran boot-repair.  Now I get this message\nGPT detected.  Please create a BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag).  This can be performed via tools such as Gparted.  Then try again.\n\n=======================\nBoth of my attempts at making custom partitions during installation have failed.  First I tried with no /boot and no bios_grub partition, then I tried with /boot but no bios_grub, neither worked.  \nNow I am trying the normal install one last time, and plan to use the boot-repair disk instead of boot-repair command line.\n=====================\nThe boot repair disk did not work, it would not even start.  I tried one last time to do boot-repair from the live USB.  This time when I rebooted, I told my BIOS to use the third hard disk the very first time.  Then it finally took me to a GRUB menu where I could choose an OS to launch.  Unfortunately, when I chose Ubuntu, it just immediately threw an exception and failed to launch.\nI am giving up on Ubuntu.  I have already wasted about 20 hours trying to install this just this weekend.  Nobody is giving me help, at least not help that works.\n\nA: Have you tried the boot-repair-disk? When I couldn't run ubuntu, even after use of boot-repair, this image helped me.\np.s. Mega - it's 1000 0000. Mebi it's 1024x1024.

I'm not sure if I've got the wrong end of the stick (so to speak).  Your question reminds me of a similar scenario I found myself in a few years back. If you already know what I'm about to tell you. Then please accept my apologises I do not wish to patronise.  \nThe output you have provided clearly shows there is something  going slightly wrong during the shut down process. It looks as though the modem manager isn't exiting as cleanly as perhaps it should. But the system is recovering by forcing the process to end. The final message you get “Will now halt” confirms the system is halted. \n\nThe cursor remains blinking but the only way to switch it off is to\n  hold the power-off key pressed for some seconds.\nI tried sudo shutdown -h now, sudo halt and sudo poweroff resulting in\n  the same problem.\n\nNow this is the bit that reminds me of my scenario a few years back. I had exactly the same problem running an Ubuntu Server with no gui. I spent sometime researching the problem. If I remember correctly the fault was simply that the system was not sending the mobo poweroff signal. I'm fairly sure at the time there was an open bug recorded for the issue. Anyway, the workaround I found was to pass the power off flag to the halt command:-\nsudo halt -p\n\nusing the taskbar's shot-down button lead to a direct stop of the laptop equal to holding the power-off key pressed for some seconds.\nCan you provide more details for this part? Watch closely, try to see if the system is shutting down cleanly albeit very quickly. Or is it just stopping in it's tracks quite literally as though the power was ripped out. Press esc key to remove the dots and see what is being reported in the text output. Sometimes a camera is handy to catch fast moving text as it scrolls by.\nI ask because my Xubuntu media PC (as with most of my Linux boxes)  shuts down sooooo fast it often looks as though the power has been ripped out. This is one area I struggled with when I first moved from Windows. It was a case of click shutdown and boom the Linux system was gone. None of the “looging off” and  “Do not power off your system installing 1 of 90000 updates” messages. \nAnyway like I said I do not wish to patronise, if you already knew this please except my apology . It is hard to judge someone's experience level when conversing by text only.\n\nA: You can generally shut down your computer by holding down Alt and Prt Sc and then slowly pressing REISUB in that order.  It works on most computers.

If you had a software issue, and software was causing a reboot, you would have log data of some kind on it. Even in the case of a kernel panic, you would have some log data written somewhere (probably dmesg). There's clearly nothing in the logs, they just end and start with a fresh boot.\nNot having log data means your system couldn't write anything to disk. This means one of two things: Your hard disks were unavailable, or your system suddenly lost power.\nCheck that your servers have adequate power sources. If you have UPSes, make sure they're ok. This is usually the failure point when multiple servers have this problem at the same time.\n", "Q: http request to cgi python script successful, but the script doesn't seem to run I have configured cgi scripts for my apache2 web server.\nHere is what I want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Client uploads the image to the server.

I decided to let the installation procedure set up encryption. I knew all along that I would have to decrypt it with the passphrase in order to get the system booted, but I assumed it wouldn't matter since it will only boot once or twice a month.\nHowever, my brother has informed me that he is a victim of power outages at the residence where this server is located. This means we have to explain to his girlfriend how to turn on the computer, attach a keyboard, connect a monitor (she just can't understand that she can type to the computer without a display, so whatever) and input the passphrase for us, while we are at work.\nI have arrived at the conclusion that I should just put together a USB key that can be plugged in before powering on the computer, to avoid all the trouble.\nIs this possible with ecryptfs? Is there a tutorial or simple list of instructions available so that I can knock this out and focus back on the stuff I care about?\nEDIT: I am aware that this is possible with LUKS and dm-crypt, but unfortunately the magical encryption that Ubuntu hands you during the installation is only ecryptfs so my question is specific to that.\n\nA: As far as I know you cannot do this with ecryptfs, but it should be possible with LUKS. \nI don't know how it would work out in your scenario with a headless server and the given circumstances. I think it would result in the key being always plugged in. I'd suggest buying and configuring a UPS and OOB over the USB-key method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount LUKS encrypted hard drive at boot\n\n*HOWTO: Automatically unlock LUKS encrypted drives with a keyfile\n\n*Dm-crypt/Device_encryption - Unlock the root partition at boot using a keyfile (Instructions are specific to Arch Linux)\n\n\nA: One possibility you might want to consider is getting a USB Rubber Duckey to do the job. It is a flash drive-shaped device that impersonates a keyboard to deliver its payload of key presses, the way you might if you were typing to it without a screen. That way, she can just plug it in the same way she would with a regular flash drive.\n", "Q: CD tray won't open after accidentally stopping Brasero CD burn My laptop is an HP Pavilion g6, running Xubuntu 14.04. I was burning a CD, but accidentally pressed the spacebar. Brasero immediately stopped burning, now I can't open the CD tray anymore. I've tried ejecting using the hardware button, in Nautilus, and using the terminal eject command — nothing worked.

Brasero is a buggy application.\nUse k3b, which can be installed by using this command:\nsudo apt-get install k3b\n\nIf you don't want all the kde dependencies, use xfburn. Which is installed with this command:\nsudo apt-get install xfburn\n\nNow for the issue at hand.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you don't have a file browser opening looking at the CD\n\n*Make sure brasero isn't still trying to access the CD\n\n*If that doesn't work, get a small pin and try pressing the button in the small hole found on the front of the drive.\n\n\nA: Okay, I finally got it working. I got the CD tray open when the laptop was just on, before Ubuntu launched. Now everything works fine again.\n", "Q: How to write Makefile to package a .so dynamic library that will install all required links I need help in writing a Makefile that installs my library on Linux FHS. https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html#s-sharedlibs-dev says that there should be a link from .so to .so.$(version).$(minor) and a link from .so.$(version) to .so to .so.$(version).$(minor).

I restarted the system (hoping there will be a recovery file as inkscape .svg) but there wasn't. Is there any possibility I can get my file via that .png extension or is there any other solution or backup? I need my file layers back.\n\nA: The PNG is a bitmap export and does not contain any \"vector\" information about layers, paths, nodes, etc. There is no way whatsoever to get this kind of information back from the PNG.\nIf your laptop stopped working altogether, probably Inkscape has not been able to do an Emergency save (since it didn't crash strictly speaking, your system as a whole went down).\nConcerning Auto Save and Emergency save:\n\n1) When Inkscape crashes, it tries to save the current state in an\n  emergency save file and notifies the user in a popup dialog about its\n  file name and location if it succeeds. There might be occasions\n  (getting rarer with more recent versions of Inkscape) where due to the\n  nature of the crash the emergency save fails.\nThe location and file name of the emergency-saved file depends on\n  whether the file has been saved earlier, and to some extend on the OS:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*For unsaved files, the base name of the emergency file is 'New Document' (or the localized version of it). At the end of this base\n  name, a date and time stamp is added, as well as the suffix \".svg\".\n  The location for emergency saves of unsaved files is $HOME on Linux\n  and OS X, and %UserProfile% on Windows (actual location varies\n  depending on Windows version and system configuration).\n  \n*For files which have already been saved earlier, a date and time stamp is added to the original file name, and - if permissions allow -\n  the emergency save file is created in the same directory as the\n  original one which was currently edited.\n  \n*If permissions prevent saving either in the current directory or in $HOME (or %UserProfile%), inkscape tries to save it in $TMPDIR.\n  \n  \n  See also:\n  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.graphics.inkscape.devel/34122/focus=34141\n2) In addition to the emergency save mechanism, Inkscape has an\n  auto-save feature:\n  http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Release_notes/0.47#Autosave\n  Note that this feature needs to be enabled and configured by the user\n  first (it is not enabled by default), and the directory specified in\n  the preferences dialog needs to exist (Inkscape does not create it\n  itself if missing).\n\n(source: https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/1177695)\n", "Q: Auto mount USB drive with permissions for all users I have an Ubuntu 14.04 based Media Center and I store the media files on a USB HDD.  I add files to drive directly on a Mac so I have it formatted as FAT32.\nThe problem is that after reconnecting the drive to the Ubuntu, it mounts at /media/user/drivename and only the root user is allowed access.  I need several applications to have full access to this drive.  I can change file permissions in the terminal but it doesn't change because of the /media/user location.  I am able to manually sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /media/drivename & sudo chmod 777 /media/drivename but the mount point changes each time.\nIs there a way to make this drive always mount where root and other applications have access?\n\nA: Since you have the UUID, you can edit /etc/fstab and add an entry like so:\nUUID=<the UUID> /media/drivename vfat rw,nofail,umask=022,uid=<UID>,gid=<GID> 0 0\n\nReplace <UID> and <GID> with the output of id -u and id -g respectively.\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*We need the UUID since the drive is a removable one, and we can't rely on /dev/sdXY as an identifier.\n\n*vfat is the mount type for FAT32 systems\n\n*The nofail option should prevent mount from complaining, or your boot from being held up, if the disk is not present.\n\n*The uid=<UID>,gid=<GID> options set the ownership of all files and folders in the mounted disk, since FAT32 doesn't have a Unix-like permission/ownership structure. This doesn't affect the files themselves, only the mounted representation. Ditto for the umask.\n\n", "Q: wish missing but tk is installed I was wanting to tinker around with TCL/TK programming.\nI tried to invoke the wish shell, but got this error:\n$ wish\nThe program 'wish' is currently not installed.

A working program trad (from Radiance) stopped working as it required wish (window shell script language like bash). Although latest \"tk\" was installed on my system, wish was not found. \nIt seems the program trad was looking for \"wish\" which had been renamed/ installed as \"wish8.6\".

Would it be possible to download 14.04 to my desktop (without installing it), copying the download to a CD-ROM, and booting up the laptop from the CD-ROM?\n\nA: your upgrade is most likely ruined, and your files are most likely lost. But I would create a live-CD/USB and boot it. This is to see if your files are still there so you can make a backup.\nClick on try Ubuntu and then try to mount the hard drive/SSD and make a backup of your files. then I would make a clean install. \nYou might be able to fix the broken upgrade but it will take a lot of time if it's possible at all. And you might end up with a really slow system. So just make a clean install. \nSee this question for more info\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu?\n\nA: Most likely your installation is botched.  What you can try doing before reinstalling the operating system is physically removing the battery from your laptop while the laptop is plugged into the AC Adapter.  Hypothetically, the OS should skip the check after determining that the battery isn't present.\nAdditionally, if you want to try and restore the operating system, create a boot disk on a CD: How to install Ubuntu.\nAs long as you don't format your hard drive when you install, the install will just correct/replace/install the system critical files and hopefully save your files.
