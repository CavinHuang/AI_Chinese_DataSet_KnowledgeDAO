["Q: Why can't I just delete or format Windows 10 partition from Ubuntu without using Gparted? I have Windows 10 and Ubuntu installations on my laptop. I want to uninstall or delete the Windows 10 and put back my old Windows 7 OS (I don't have the the rollback option to go back to Windows 7, only rollback to 8.1 is available, new lap came with 8.1).\nSo I was thinking why not just delete the Windows 10 by formatting the OS drive from Ubuntu and install Windows 7 on the formatted drive. Will this work? Please help!\nAnd how do I delete the windows boot loader from disk? Thanks!\n\nA: First, since you are dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows 10, it is clear that currently you are using GRUB as your bootloader that comes from Ubuntu. So, to answer this part:\nAnd how do I delete the windows boot loader from disk?\n\nIf you delete the Windows partition, the windows bootloader will be removed without causing any issue as your current active bootloader is GRUB and you are just deleting an inactive one.\nTo answer this part of your question:\nSo I was thinking why not just delete the Windows 10 by formatting the OS drive \nfrom Ubuntu and install Windows 7 on the formatted drive. Will this work?\n\nYes, of course you can delete your Windows 10 partition from Ubuntu using GParted or any other similar tool (even cli ones) and then make a bootable pendrive or DVD using Unetbootin or K3B respectively. Boot from that pendrive and install windows 7 in the partition that previously contained Windows 10.\nFor this part:\nWhy can't I just delete or format Windows 10 partition from Ubuntu without using Gparted?\n\nYes, you can use other tools to format your Windows 10 partition apart from Gparted such as fdisk but it's much more easier to use GParted, then anything else currrently available. If you are wondering about GParted Live DVD, then it's not absolutely necessary. You can install GParted inside Ubuntu, by typing the following command:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nN.B.: If your laptop is still under warranty, then please contact your manufacturer before deleting any partition because in my country doing that voids the warranty.\nSolution to N.B. You can back up your partitions with tools such as Clonezilla or the good old dd command to keep your warranty intact.\n", "Q: Printing issues on 14.04 LTS I have an HP Deskjet 2542. the printer is fine but the HPLIP program always delays me when I try to scan or print.

I currently use \"x2go\" as the remote-desktop connection software, but this question applies more to the desktop packages rather than the connection client. The server is also hosted using AWS, if that is relevant. \nI now have about 10 regular users on the system. A concern that has come to my attention is the usage of audio processes on the server. I can run top and see many \"kmix\" processes, which take about 5% cpu each, and many \"pulseaudio\" processes, which range from 2-10% cpu each. In the case of \"kmix\", it looks like the same user is even spawning more than one process. \nThis is a serious drain on system resources, and there is no use of sound whatsoever in the usage of this system. (it is a research platform) How can I cleanly remove or disable all audio processes and features, system wide, from the \"kubuntu-desktop\" package?\n\nA: You can disable sound in the session settings on the client. If this does not help, try disabling autostart of pulseaudio for the users.\nRemoving pulseaudio completely from the system may result in unpredictable behaviour.\nEdit: Setting \"autospawn = no\" in /etc/pulse/client.conf should keep pulseaudio from autostarting for all users (man pulse-client.conf).

Please forgive me as I am fairly new at this.  However, I feel like I am fairly close I am just missing the ability to boot from an EFI partition.  Here are the particulars on my situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu version 15.10 64 bit  on /dev/sba – hd1\n\n*Windows 10 64 bit on /dev/sdc – hd0\n\n*OS X 64 bit booting from an EFI partition.

I tried changing the last line to boot instead of chainloader and then I get an error you need to load the kernel first.  I have researched the kernel and at this point I am not finding any answers.  This is strictly a test system so I’m not too concerned about crashing the system.\nIf anyone has any ideas please let me know.\n\nA: LiveWireBT is on the right track, but the answer is a bit different. Like LiveWireBT, I think this is a Secure Boot issue. The trouble is that, AFAIK, Clover doesn't explicitly support Secure Boot; and even if it did, Apple doesn't, so Apple's boot loader is not signed with a Secure Boot key. Clover works by launching EFI applications in a way that requires they be signed if Secure Boot is active, though, so anything launched through Clover will fail if it's not signed by a key provided in your firmware.\nThe easy solution to this problem is to disable Secure Boot in your firmware. With Secure Boot disabled, there will be no Secure Boot checks and everything will work. The trouble with this approach is that you won't get any benefits of Secure Boot, which means that malware could theoretically take control of your computer's pre-boot environment, which would be very difficult to fix. AFAIK, such attacks remain rare (maybe non-existent) in the wild, but they are possible.\nA solution of medium complexity is to replace or supplement GRUB with my rEFInd. rEFInd supports Secure Boot, but it does so in a different way from GRUB, so that follow-on programs use Shim even when they aren't explicitly written to support it. Thus, if Clover is launched from rEFInd, Clover will be able to launch programs that are signed with keys that Shim recognizes. For this approach to work, you'll need to sign Clover, Clover's drivers, and Apple's boot.efi with your own key, which will add some setup and maintenance burden.\nThe most complex solution is to replace your computer's current set of Secure Boot keys with your own set. This set can include Microsoft's keys, but it can also include your own keys, which you'd use to sign Clover, Clover's driver, and Apple's boot.efi. These should all then launch with Secure Boot active. You could boot through GRUB, rEFInd, or anything else. (You could even set Clover as your main boot loader and use it to select between Windows, GRUB, and OS X.) The main drawback is that swapping out the keys is a rather involved process. I cover it in detail here, if you're interested in trying, or at least reading up on it to evaluate whether or not to try it. Also, if you go this route, you may have to periodically sign updated binaries when you update Clover, the Apple boot loader, and perhaps others. This will add a small burden to ongoing system maintenance, just as in the rEFInd solution.\n\nA: Edit: Just remembered that Clover is a Hackintosh bootloader not an official Apple bootloader and a Mac, what I expected when I wrote this answer.\n\ninvalid signature sounds like your OSX install expects a secure boot chain like Secure Boot on Windows platforms. I'm not sure if this applies here but usually hfs-bless or Macs bless command were used to allow EFI booting of non-OSX installations on Macs. Similar to how Linux Foundations preloader bridges the gap of an unsigned EFI loader, bless theoretically should enable the foreign loader (GRUB) to start OSX.\nhfs-bless is available in the Mactel PPA.\nBtw. chainloader should be correct and sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg and sudo update-grub are the same, just do a whereis to find the path and look at update-grub in an editor. \n\nA: I was trying to do the same on a BIOS boot system, and I encountered a similar error. Instructions and examples I found for this case aren't clear. Are you using the UEFI mode GRUB2, or the BIOS installation? The BIOS installation probably can't chainload into EFI. Something to try if that's BIOS mode: try to chainload a bootloader on MBR or partition. It's a good idea to install a bootloader on every disk just in case, if you're using a multi-boot system, BTW.

Now the situation is better. Operation on disks sdc and sdd still affects performance of sda, but load average keeps on 6-7 and the system is not overloaded. And I think now I understand what may be the reason of the issue. Since sda and sdb (as parts of RAID) used for webserver, they have constant stream of parallel requests. Hard disks have to constanly move their heads thereby reducing IO performance, but the system IO cache (I believe linux uses all free memory for this purpose) helps to minimize the number of disk accesses. When I begin to intensively use other disks, the cache becames filled with new data, that is why this increases the load on the main disks. If I'm right, increasing the amount of RAM will help. Now it's only 16 GB.\n\nA: Most likely the disks are all on the same controller and the controller is the bottleneck.  That is to say, there is a limit to the throughput of the sum total of io to all of the disks, so when you start using one heavily, there is less available to the others.\n\nA: You could try a different disk scheduler. Check to see what is currently in use on your disks (i.e. for sda):\n\ncat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler\n\nYou might see:\n\nnoop anticipatory deadline [cfq]\n\nThen you could decide what scheduler to use for each disk, depending on what type they are (ssd, hdd) or what controller they are on. Simply set it to a different scheduler by typing: \n\necho {SCHEDULER-NAME} > /sys/block/{DEVICE-NAME}/queue/scheduler\n\nSo if you want to use deadline for sda it would be: \n\necho deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler\n\nYou might find using deadline on a server will give you better responsiveness while under heavy load.\nIf you want to change the scheduler for ALL disks:\nEdit /etc/default/grub:\n\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nYou need to add elevator=deadline.

INT sets a command to be run when the SIGINT signal is received (which is the signal generated when you press CtrlC). \n\n*$$ is the PID of the current process (that is, of the script itself). pkill -P $$ kills those processes whose parent process i the script.\n\n*It is convention that a program which catches SIGINT kill itself using SIGINT once it has tidied up. Hence, the kill -INT $$.\n\n*seq 1000 generates numbers from 1 to 1000.\n\n*The while loop runs the command provided as arguments to the script once for each number from seq, and sends them to the background.\n\n*Then we wait until all of the background processes finish executing.\n\n\nRun it thus:\n./run-parallel.sh php process.php\n\n\nA: You can use xargs. Just print the name of the process you want 100 times and pass it to xargs:\nperl -e 'print \"/path/to/process.php\\n\" x 100' | xargs -P 100 -I {} php {} \n\nThe Perl command simply prints /path/to/process.php followed by a newline 100 times. This is then passed to xargs which is told to launch up to 100 parallel commands (-P 100). The -I {} tells xargs to replace the string {} with its input. Therefore, php {} is expanded to php /path/to/process.php. Since everything is done by xargs, a single Ctrl+C will kill all of them, and all output is printed to the same terminal. \n\nA: You can write a Master program to start 1000 times php process.php. Using fork and exec may be convenient if you use C. When the Master starts a new php process, it also records its pid.\nShow current number of running instance: the Master can monitor the status of the subprocesses.\nCtrl+C should terminate all instance at once: the Master captures Ctrl+C signal, and kills all the subprocesses (kill(pid, SIGKILL);) or notifies them to exit.\n", "Q: i want to convert Ubuntu to Xubuntu but I get this problem Using this command apt-get install xubuntu-desktop i get this:\nSome packages could not be installed.

PulseAudio is the only sound device Linux Skype supports, and that's that.  I solved this problem on my own system by installing an extension wire on the speaker jack; I plug in the speakers most of the time, and switch to the headphones when I'm on Skype.  You could do this more smoothly with a small A/B switch box with suitable jacks and plugs -- but there isn't any way to do it in software.\n", "Q: Can I damage a battery by changing operating systems? My laptop's battery started performing badly after switching to Ubuntu and unfortunately I was no longer within the warranty period so I figured I had to buy a new battery at some point. I switched back to Windows for school later on. The battery would last about 3.5/4 hours at this point, and worked like that for almost a year. \nI wanted to use Ubuntu again about a week ago and after installing it my battery performed even worse, only lasting about 1 to 1.5 hours. I wondered if using Windows would at least reverse the condition but after doing that my laptop now exclusively works plugged in. Windows says \"plugged in, not charging\" but the charger itself isn't damaged at all. Seeing how to battery acted before it makes more sense anyway that it is in fact defect. \nIt seems I've undergone battery issues three times after changing OS. I've never heard anything regarding this so I was wondering if you guys might have. Could this have been the reason my battery died? \nThe laptop is \"only\" 2.5 years old and it was an expensive one at that. It seems very odd behavior. It's a Samsung Ativ Book 9 if anyone is wondering. \nThanks for reading and thanks in advance. \nRegards,\n\nA: What you're seeing seems more like a change in power management than a case of the OS damaging the battery.  It might be that your power management settings in Windows were/are much more aggressive than what you are/were using in Ubuntu.  It only takes a longer screen sleep delay, not turning off the HDD during sleep, etc. to make the difference in battery life you're seeing.\nMeanwhile, simple age is depleting your battery's capacity over time, so after running Ubuntu for a few months (many dozens of charge cycles, most likely) you'd see somewhat reduced life on switching back in Windows, compared to previously, even with identical power management settings to the previous Windows usage.\nIn general, however, no, changing OS won't damage your battery -- but just using the machine over a period of years will wear out the battery, slowly.\n\nA: In short - damage? No.  Use and report its usage differently?  Yes.\nThere are various threads reporting behaviour somewhat like what you describe.\nUbuntu 12.04 Battery problem\nIs there ongoing work in the kernel team to improve battery life under linux?\nThe main cause may be that it's not very straightforward for a generic\nmulti-platform and multi-archicture operating system (Ubuntu) to match the\nnative drivers provided by the vendor to optimize for the most efficient power\nusage.\nAdditionally, a genuine battery straight from the vendor at 2.5 years of age\nshould be performing quite well, at this age it's conceivable that it already\nstarted to deteriorate.\nYour usage under Linux might be very different as well.  It's very well\npossible for any user to handle different workloads under Linux than under\nWindows.  It's not as common to run, under Windows, web servers,\nmultiple language backends, multiple databases, and long running infrastructure\nservices on a laptop.\nIt can also make a big difference to ongoing battery life when you charge, and\nhow do you charge your batteries.    It doesn't do too much good to keep a device on charger for example.  Also, you may be doing it differently when you use\nyour laptop with different programs.\n", "Q: Is it safe to use a disk after a successful fsck? I had not used my venerable ThinkPad T400 for about 2 weeks.

In  actuality,  fsck  is  simply a front-end for the various filesystem\n         checkers (fsck.fstype) available under Linux.\n\nSo, if fsck reports that everything is all well and good, take it as so!\n\nA: Yes. You're worse off running a Linux system without running fsck than running fsck. FSCK repairs your Linux. Here's one experience, if anyone wants to know:\nMy Ubuntu was acting strange. So many errors. I decided to go on recovery. It for some reason didn't even boot. It told me to run fsck, and that /dev/sda5 had errors. I did fsck /dev/sda5 and after some time, the computer had no errors. Remember: fsck is your friend.\n\nA: The specific errors you mention are common after a crash or power loss and result from files still being open at the time of the crash.  e2fsck easily fixes them and gets the filesystem back to a sane state.\n", "Q: Getting Permission denied when trying to setup rTorrent with lighttpd I want to create locally a rTorrent RPC server.\nI installed rTorrent, here is ~/.rtorrent.rc\ndownload_rate = 500\n#upload_rate = 150\n\ndirectory = ~/torrent/data\n\nsession = ~/torrent/session\n\nport_range = 6881-6999\nport_random = no\n\ncheck_hash = yes\n\nschedule = watch_directory,15,15,load_start=~/torrent/torrent_active/*.torrent\n\ndht = auto\n\ndht_port = 6880\n\nencryption = allow_incoming,require,require_rc4\n\nscgi_local = /home/vinz243/torrent/rpc.socket\n\nand my lighttpd.conf:\nserver.modules = (\n    \"mod_access\",\n    \"mod_alias\",\n    \"mod_compress\",\n    \"mod_redirect\",\n#       \"mod_rewrite\",\n)\n\nserver.document-root        = \"/var/www/html\"\nserver.upload-dirs          = ( \"/var/cache/lighttpd/uploads\" )\nserver.errorlog             = \"/var/log/lighttpd/error.log\"\nserver.pid-file             = \"/var/run/lighttpd.pid\"\nserver.username             = \"www-data\"\nserver.groupname            = \"www-data\"\nserver.port                 = 80\n\n\nindex-file.names            = ( \"index.php\", \"index.html\", \"index.lighttpd.html\" )\nurl.access-deny             = ( \"~\", \".inc\" )\nstatic-file.exclude-extensions = ( \".php\", \".pl\", \".fcgi\" )\n\ncompress.cache-dir          = \"/var/cache/lighttpd/compress/\"\ncompress.filetype           = ( \"application/javascript\", \"text/css\", \"text/html\", \"text/plain\" )\n\n# default listening port for IPv6 falls back to the IPv4 port\n## Use ipv6 if available\n#include_shell \"/usr/share/lighttpd/use-ipv6.pl \" + server.port\ninclude_shell \"/usr/share/lighttpd/create-mime.assign.pl\"\n\n\ninclude_shell \"/usr/share/lighttpd/include-conf-enabled.pl\"\n\nserver.modules += ( \"mod_scgi\" )\nscgi.server = (\n                \"/RPC2\" =>\n                  ( \"127.0.0.1\" =>\n                    (\n                      \"socket\" => \"/home/vinz243/torrent/rpc.socket\",\n                      \"check-local\" => \"disable\",\n                      \"disable-time\" => 0,  # don't disable scgi if connection fails\n                    )\n                  )\n              )\n\nWhen I run rTorrent it runs correctly I just have those lines at the bottom:\n(20:00:31) Using 'epoll' based polling.\n(20:00:31) Using 'epoll' based polling.\n(20:00:31) Using 'epoll' based polling.\n(20:00:31) Closed XMLRPC log.\n\nHowever when I try in my browser to go tolocalhost/RPC2,\nHere is /var/log/lighttpd/error.log:\n2015-12-23 19:45:08: (log.c.164) server started \n2015-12-23 19:45:29: (mod_scgi.c.1393) connect failed: 7 Permission denied 13 0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n2015-12-23 19:45:29: (mod_scgi.c.2410) fcgi-server disabled:  0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n2015-12-23 19:45:29: (mod_scgi.c.2790) all handlers for  /RPC2 on /RPC2 are down. \n2015-12-23 19:45:30: (mod_scgi.c.2108) fcgi-server re-enabled:  0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n2015-12-23 19:45:35: (mod_scgi.c.1393) connect failed: 7 Permission denied 13 0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n2015-12-23 19:45:35: (mod_scgi.c.2410) fcgi-server disabled:  0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n2015-12-23 19:45:35: (mod_scgi.c.2790) all handlers for  /RPC2 on /RPC2 are down. \n2015-12-23 19:45:36: (mod_scgi.c.2108) fcgi-server re-enabled:  0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n2015-12-23 19:45:45: (mod_scgi.c.1393) connect failed: 7 No such file or directory 2 0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n2015-12-23 19:45:45: (mod_scgi.c.2410) fcgi-server disabled:  0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n2015-12-23 19:45:45: (mod_scgi.c.2790) all handlers for  /RPC2 on /RPC2 are down. \n2015-12-23 19:45:46: (mod_scgi.c.2108) fcgi-server re-enabled:  0 /home/claire/torrent/rpc.socket \n\n\nA: Correct answer\nTo solve the problem just add this to your rtorrent.rc:\nschedule = scgi_permission,0,0,\"execute.nothrow=chmod,\\\"g+w,o=\\\",/home/user/rtorrent/rpc.socket\"\n\nOld answer with history\nrTorrent is weird..

Here's my monitors.xml. By the way, This solution didn't help.\n\nA: There are many possible reasons why a screen configuration does not \"survive\" a restart. In most cases, there are local sources like the monitors.xml file that simply overrule previously made settings. \nFinding out what it is exactly, can be time-consuming, so my approach would be the practical solution: simply overrule whatever happens on log in by a simple command or small (xrandr) script. In this case, it is probably done by the command:\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DVI-I-0 --pos 1366x0\n\nwhich arranges the screens from left to right, which you should always do.\nAdd the command to startup (log in)\nChoose Dash > Startup Applications > Add, add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && xrandr --output VGA-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DVI-I-0 --pos 1366x0\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*postioning a screen can be done with the command:\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --pos 0x0\n\nto position e.g the left screen, then:\n\n*Always arrange the screens from left to right\n\n*The sleep 15 is to make sure the command runs when the desktop is \"ready\", and possible local settings do not overrule the command.\n\n\nA: To expound further on one aspect of @Jacob's answer: The monitor.xml file does override any similar left-to-right ordering that is set up in the nVidia Settings.  Under Unity, System Settings/Display updates the ~/.config/monitor.xml file.  Change the order of what monitor is on the left or right by dragging and dropping the rectangular boxes at the top of the window:\n\nStart nVidia Settings via the main Search Your Computer button:\n\nAnd it is here that you think you can change the order, but the monitor.xml file will override it:\n\nI was tempted to just delete the monitors.xml file, in hope that the nVidia Settings would take command of the situation, but a comment on another answer implies this is not a good thing to do.\n", "Q: Can anyone with physical access to my computer access my files? I wonder what will happen if my computer got stolen.\nCan a hacker gain access to the files on my computer? \nI have Ubuntu 14.04 and have not installed any security programs - should I do something to protect myself against this?\n\nA: I know you're likely not worried about state secrets or very valuable data, but the correct answer is \"Yes\".  Someone with physical can always access your files, always.  Full disk encryption makes the process significantly slower (time could be measured in years or centuries), but the attacker can access your files.  \nSee the 10 immutable laws of security.  Law 3 specifically states:\n\nIf a bad guy has unrestricted physical access to your\n  computer, it's not your computer anymore\n\nThe article goes into a number of great ways you can get owned here, including but not limited to making a copy of your disk, adding a keylogger and giving it back to you.  Once you enter the password, the malware can send it back to the attacker, letting him decrypt his copy of your disk.\nAnd never forget what xkcd has taught us:\n\nPasswords are insufficient if you are not torture-resistant\nBottom Line\nIf you're not worried about the NSA, or other groups willing to spend millions of dollars, years of time, or torture you, full disk encryption is probably fine.  But it does not mean that you are 100% safe.  Storing no data on your laptop and only VPN'ing to a secure machine is probably a better idea.  Don't forget MFA and your tin foil hat.\n\nA: Linux systems do not protect against abuse through physical access. An admin password can be changed through grub and through a live session without supplying the previous admin password (this is intentional: having ownership allows you to do anything with it).\nYour data is not accessible if you use encryption for at least your private data or for your whole system. However, I believe more people lost their data by forgetting their access key than through theft. Plus in general it is the hardware they want, not your data. And it is always smart to format a disk without accessing it if it was not yours: a simple keylogger is enough to send details about the connection it is using to your mail account so you can track the system down.\n\nA: Anyone who has physical access to your computer can reset the password quite easily. The general Linux philosophy is that if someone has physical access to PC then has possibility to do anything. For example see this post. It is a proper philosophy as you wouldn't like to lose your hardware/software/data just because you forgot your passwords.\nIf you wish to protect your PC then consider BIOS/UEFI password and disk encryption.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu work on a MacBook Pro 9,2?

Probably the most troublesome thing you will have to deal with is getting the wireless card working, as it's an airport/bluetooth card. It may use a fully broadcomm based chipset (as I believe many apple products do, at least in their mobile space) or it may have an apple-manufactured chipset.

This happens from time to time.\n", "Q: Two Linux OSes on same machine - can edit files on the other OS safely? I originally had an Xubuntu 14.04 (32 bit) on my machine. I have now also installed a Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) on the same machine and plan to migrate eventually there. In both OSes I have access to files belonging to the other OS. \nIf I edit a file belonging to Xubuntu while I am on the new OS, or the other way around, would the other OS think the FS is corrupt once I boot it up? The files are mostly php, css, js, html files and nothing fancy/crazy.\n\nA: It depends on which files will be changed. If you edit let's say a Libre Office spreadsheet file you were working on, then nothing wrong will happen. However if you change system files (for example files in /etc /bin or similar locations) it might corrupt your system. Such situation will occur regardless of the system you are working on at the moment. However in general every OS defends its important files and requires for example root password to edit them. So there might exist a possibility to change seamlessly even the important files belonging to one system while working on the other one.\n\nA: You shouldn't have to worry about filesystem corruption as long as you do clean shutdowns and unmounts. Avoid editing system configuration files1. You can edit your own documents without worry; many people dual-boot their systems and work with their files on multiple OSes.\n1As long as ensure your edits are correct, you should be fine with those too.\n", "Q: Driver problem with Ubuntu? I have a password set at boot up and I get this error after I enter my password: \n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1 is not ready\n\nWhat caused this and how do I fix it?\n\nA: This is trying to mount your encrypted swap partition (encrypted swap is required for encrypted $HOME directories to be usable), and it seems that the initialization is taking too long. Your system will come up normally, but without that swap space. If the free command shows less swap than expected, you can re-initialize swap by logging in, and \nsudo /usr/sbin/cryptdisks_start  ubuntu--vg-swap_1\n\n", "Q: Why doesn't my dvd/cd-rom show up with the \"mount\" command? So, mount is supposed to show all file systems mounted in the OS file system. However, this is not the case for my system: the drive is called cdda//:sr0/, and no part of this is revealed in the mount command.\nDid the Ubuntu developers get the idea to abandon the \"one file system for all devices\" scheme and create a separate file system for the cd-rom drive? This is what my intuition tells me.\nThanks \n\nA: This looks like an audio CD. Audio CDs can't be mounted because they don't have a file system. But most desktop environments create something like a \"fake mount\" for audio CDs and some other devices so the users can easily access them like mountable devices (for GTK bases desktop environments like Unity and GNOME this is actually done by GIO).\nYou can identify those \"fake mounts\" as they are not shown as a file system path starting with / but as URIs starting with something like cdda://.\nmount doesn't know anything about those \"fake mounts\".\n", "Q: How to solve [Errno 30] Read-only file system I'm new to this forum, and this is my first question: \nI bought the meizu MX4 ubuntu edition today.

There is a part Enabling read-write mode which fixed this problem. It says:\n\nEnabling read-write mode\nBy default the system is read-only. You can switch to read-write mode,\nalthough this disables Ubuntu system upgrades. The main purpose for\nthis is developing the Ubuntu system directly. This is not required\nfor developing apps or using the system normally.

I downloaded it, make'd it and it works nicely for the user.\nThe red formatting however is lost when the command is summoned through sudo.  Specifically, red formatting is visible with this command:\n$ /usr/games/cowsay -f fudge Yo\ncowsay: Could not find fudge cowfile!\n\nbut not with this command:\n$ sudo /usr/games/cowsay -f fudge Yo\ncowsay: Could not find fudge cowfile!\n\nI have tried editing /root/.bashrc to contain:\nexport LD_PRELOAD=\"/home/user/path/to/stderred/build/libstderred.so${LD_PRELOAD:+:$LD_PRELOAD}\"\n\nbut that apparently does not make it work.  What am I missing?\n\nA: This is because sudo command runs command in its own subshell, started by root. This means that your ~/.bashrc file is ignored. It also means that any environment variables defined in the parent shell (such as the LD_PRELOAD you are setting in ~/.bashrc) are not passed to the sudo shell. This is explained in man sudoers:\n\nBy default, the env_reset option is enabled.  This causes commands to\n  be  executed with a new, minimal environment.  On AIX (and Linux\n  systems  without PAM), the environment is initialized with the\n  contents of the  /etc/environment file.  The new environment contains\n  the TERM, PATH,  HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME and SUDO_*\n  variables in addition to variables from the invoking process\n  permitted by the env_check  and env_keep options.  This is effectively\n  a whitelist for environment  variables.  \n\nI couldn't get the env_keep option to work here, I don't know why. The best way I could find of passing the variable to sudo is to create a file (for example /path/to/foo) with this line:\nLD_PRELOAD=\"/home/terdon/Setups/stderred/build/libstderred.so\"\n\nThen, run sudo visudo and add this line:\nDefaults        env_file=\"/path/to/foo\"\n\nThat will cause sudo to read /path/to/foo and add any variable definitions there to its environment. \n", "Q: Can't install packages without installing IBus and removing Ubuntu-desktop I have Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS.

From there, I looked up my ASUS VX238H monitor and got its horizontal and vertical refresh rates (since that data isn't making it over the wire). \nI then copied those ranges info xorg.conf fo the Monitor section looked like so (only one section was created, for the monitor that couldn't be identified automatically):\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"ASUS\"\n    ModelName      \"VX238H\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 80.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nOnce I rebooted, display settings showed a bunch more resolutions available, including the native resolution of that monitor, which I'm successfully using now.\nAs fair warning, just because a resolution is shown via this method doesn't mean your monitor magically supports it.

In fact, fdisk tells you this quite explicitly:\nWARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'! The util\nfdisk doesn't support GPT. Use GNU Parted.\n\nWhat fdisk is showing you is the MBR side of a hybrid MBR, which is an ugly and dangerous hack that Apple uses to support dual-booting between OS X and Windows. A hybrid MBR might or might not be necessary on your computer, depending on how Ubuntu was installed.\nOf equal concern, you've shown no evidence that your computer has an EFI System Partition (ESP). This is a necessary part of a normal EFI boot process. I emphasize the word normal because Macs are weird, and can boot without an ESP -- but even Macs normally ship with an ESP available. If you've accidentally deleted your ESP, your OS X would probably boot, but it might cause Ubuntu to fail to boot, depending on how it was installed. That said, your parted information was a summary, not a complete cut-and-paste, so you might simply have omitted information on your ESP. (Tip: Don't summarize the output of programs like parted that give text-mode output. Cut-and-paste the relevant output, as you did for fdisk -- ideally, you should provide the complete program output, unless that's too large. Nine times out of ten, summaries of such program output omit the details that are most important.)\nOverall, I'd say your partitioning setup is a bit suspect and may be the cause of some of your problems. Posting the complete output of parted /dev/sda print may help clarify things. (Edit your original post, then add a comment to this one so I'll notice it.) The output of sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda may also be helpful. Your video problems are likely to be unrelated to the disk issues. I recommend solving your boot problems and then create a separate question for your video issues.\n\nEDIT:\nYour edit shows that both parted and gdisk are reporting I/O errors when accessing the disk. This most likely indicates a hardware failure, which could well be the cause of your earlier problems, too. If you're lucky, the problem is nothing worse than a bad cable or loose connector; but it could be a much more serious problem. I recommend you check the SMART status of the disk. If that turns up problems, you should replace the disk immediately. If the SMART status looks OK, try re-seating the connectors and, if possible, replace the disk's data cable.\n", "Q: Does the Ubuntu type Desktop versus Server matter when installing one of the FTP's? First I did\nps -aux | grep ftp\n\nand did not find a running ftp of any kind. I'm interested in turning up an FTP service on my Ubuntu 15.04 running on my laptop.  I am aware of ftp, sftp, and vsftpd packages but I'm confused about which to install on my laptop.  Ultimately I wish to ftp into my laptop from another laptop to get and put files.  Which ftp package should I install on my laptop?\n\nA: From krizna.\nSecure FTP ( SFTP ) is your best bet. Here's what you need to do (just summing it up from the linked website):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install openssh-server package:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n\n*Create a new group ftpaccess for FTP users:\nsudo groupadd ftpaccess\n\n\n*Now make changes in this /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.\n» Find and comment the below line\nSubsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server\n\nand Add these lines at the end of the file.\nSubsystem sftp internal-sftp\nMatch group ftpaccess\nChrootDirectory %h\nX11Forwarding no\nAllowTcpForwarding no\nForceCommand internal-sftp\n\n\n\n*Restart sshd service:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\n\n*The below steps must be followed while creating Users for sftp access:\na.

Change ownership for the home directory:\nsudo chown root /home/john\n\nc. Create a folder inside home directory for writing and change ownership of that folder:\nsudo mkdir /home/john/www\n\nsudo chown john:ftpaccess /home/john/www\n\n\n*Now try to connect server using SFTP ( port : 22 ) and makesure Users can upload files to www directory and cannot access other folders outside home directory.\n\nIf you want use both FTP and SFTP together, please perform above steps (step 5) while creating users . For existing users, move them to ftpaccess group and create folder structure and ownership changes as below:\nsudo usermod john -g ftpaccess -s /usr/sbin/nologin\n\nsudo chown root /home/john\n\nsudo mkdir /home/john/www\n\nsudo chown john:ftpaccess /home/john/www\n\n\nA: You may want to add more than 1 user, and the process (for me) can be tedious, so I created a script to do it for me. nano ~/add_ftp_user.sh and paste the following:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#Loosely based on https://45squared.com/setting-sftp-ubuntu-16-04\n\nif [ \"$EUID\" -ne 0 ]\n    then echo \"Please run as root\"\n    exit\nfi\n\nCONFIG_FILE=\"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\"\n\necho Enter the username to create:\nread USERNAME\n\necho Creating user ${USERNAME}...\nadduser ${USERNAME}\nusermod -aG www-data ${USERNAME}\n\necho Setting folder permissions...\nmkdir -p /var/www/html/${USERNAME}\nchown -R ${USERNAME}:www-data /var/www/html/${USERNAME}/\n\necho Editing config file ${CONFIG_FILE}...\necho ' ' | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\necho '# Created by add_ftp_user.sh script on +%Y-%m-%d' | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\necho Match User ${USERNAME} | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\necho 'ChrootDirectory /var/www/html/'${USERNAME} | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\necho 'X11Forwarding no' | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\necho 'AllowTcpForwarding no' | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\necho 'AllowAgentForwarding no' | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\necho 'ForceCommand internal-sftp' | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\necho 'PasswordAuthentication yes' | tee -a ${CONFIG_FILE}\n\necho Restarting sshd service...\nservice sshd restart\n\necho Done\n\nThis will create a new user and they can login to yourserver.com via SFTP (which is mapped to /var/www/html/{username} on your server) and they can see the files at https://www.yourserver.com/{username}.\nIf you don't want other people seeing the files, modify the line so it reads: chown -R ${USERNAME}:${USERNAME} /var/www/html/${USERNAME}/\n", "Q: Dual-boot OS selection After dual-boot with Windows 8 and Ubuntu, at startup no option for OS selection is coming.

It does not recognize single tap, double tap, two finger scroll, or any clicking actions. Basically, the touchpad doesn't even exist.\nThis is a dual-boot and the touchpad works fine on the Windows 10 side.\nI installed updates and checked versions: kernel is 4.2, plasma is 5.4.2, and QT is 5.5.2\nI tried:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n\nand it tells me that my synaptics version is already the latest installed.

My understanding is that Kubuntu and Ubuntu really only differ in the Desktop Manager (KDS vs. Unity or GNOME) so I would think the kernel fix should work for you as well.  \nI am not a real expert either, but I found the guide to doing so here:  \nhttps://florisvanvugt.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/making-asus-ux305ca-touchpad-work-in-ubuntu/comment-page-1/#comment-17\nI ended up pulling down the 4.4-rc8 kernel from the repo and building that (instructions via a different URL at the link provided) after making the one line modification and so far the touchpad is working as expected, tap, scroll, etc.\nHopefully this would be a solution for you as well.\n\nA: I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 15.10 and my Elantech Touchpad on my Acer Aspire Laptop stopped working completely. To my surprise I couldn't even find it in the hardware devices. After exhausting fails I made a small discovery that lead me to a fix.\nAfter running DMESG and finding around the 3.5 mark when it initialized devices it mentioned an error in the PNP / TAP timing and had a note saying try running with \"i8042.nopnp\". (NO Device info was present, just the pnp/tap)\nI edited the /etc/default/grub\nAdded the recommended line to my entry to look like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i8042.nopnp\"\n\nSaved the file and ran:\nsudo update-grub\n\nRebooted and hit the function key + touchpad to enable/disable it and it worked exactly as expected to after. I noticed now in the DMESG that the timing error is gone. I mention looking at your DMESG output for that line because it's possible a different computer will have a different number in front of the .nopnp in \"i8042.nopnp\" that will need to be added to your grub entry.\nI spent half a day trying other stuff with no success and I wanted to make sure this made it into the realm of things to try. I was able to remove the line and confirm it stopped working, add the line again and touchpad was working as expected.\nThis was a 100% fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10, the touchpad DID NOT work even in the setup and I used an external usb mouse to get me started.

Since the input for the variable \"loops\" is an integer, there should be no difference between asking the user for a range and placing it in the loop, or simply setting it as a default when I write the script. However, there apparently is a difference... Any insight into solving this problem is appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: The problem is this line:\nfor number2 in {1..${loops}}\n\nThis is a question of precedence. As explained in man bash:\n\nThe order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion,\n  parameter    and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command\n  substitution    (done  in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting;\n  and pathname expansion.\n\nSo, brace expansion happens before variable expansion. Therefore, when the braces are expanded, $loops has not been evaluated to 5. This means that {1..$loops} (you don't need the second {}) expands to the string {1..5} and not the sequence of numbers from 1 to 5. The same thing happens if you use  a string instead of a variable:\n$ echo {1..5}  ## works: prints a sequence\n1 2 3 4 5\n$ echo {1..foo} ## fails: prints a string with no expansion\n{1..foo}\n\nAs a workaround, you can use seq:\nfor number2 in $(seq 1 \"$loops\"); do ...\n\nOr, even better, the right loop for the job:\nfor((number2=0;number2<=$loops; number2++)); do ...\n\n \nNote: As a general rule, you should also always quote your variables.\n", "Q: Lightdm freezes on startup if wait for GRUB I am on Ubuntu 14.04 on this hardware (with no external/proprietary driver needed).\nThese are

In any case, asking a user to interact with the script is (IMO) always a bad idea. This means you can never automate the use of the script and also creates problems like what you describe. It is usually better to pass the user's choice as an argument instead.

I've tried 1024k, 2048k etc, but nothing happend - the amount of lines remains limited.\nTo do the above said, I've tried to use information from the following: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt , https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/fb/modedb.txt and  https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt, by following the links given by commentators and those who submitted their answers - I still haven't solved it, but thanks a bunch for that, guys.\nNOTICE 1\nOne thing that did happen, is after changing the lines value with the screen Terminal Multiplexer to a large value (65000) - the screen refreshed badly. I saw white lines whenever I typed something. So I guess it did affect RAM consuming, but the amount of lines did not change.\nNOTICE 2\nI installed Ubuntu-Server 14.04.3 for reference - and most methods above work. I was able to send settings to the kernel through fbcon and set the \"lines-history\" file size to what ever I wanted, for example.\nIdeas?\n\nA: If you want to change using the GUI the answers you linked to still apply.\ni.e. even though the programs are being run on the server  the output of those programs is still being displayed and stored on your local terminal.\nJust follow the instructions given in the questions you linked to.\n.\nIf you are using Gnome-terminal and want to change via command line.\nRunning this command on your local machine (where the Gnome-terminal you are using is installed) should show you your current config. \ngconftool-2 -a /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default\n\nOn My Ubuntu 14.04 this gives lots of key value pairs including\n...\ncursor_shape = block\n scrollback_lines = 10000\n use_theme_colors = false\n...\n\nThen this command should set your scroll back history to 60,000 lines\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/scrollback_lines --type int 60000\n\nI did this on my system and then tested by running the command\ncat /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small\n\nThis will output 52,000 lines into your terminal, if you can scroll back to the beginning of the dictionary - it worked.\nIf you want to set to unlimited, you could try \ngconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/scrollback_unlimited --type boolean true\n\n\nA: I suggest you work around the issue using screen or byobu-screen. My preference is for byobu-screen as it has better user interface.\nscreen and byobu-screen allow using -h flag, which will allow setting custom scrollback number of lines. For instance, byobu-screen -h 100 will limit my scroll back to 100 lines, and vice versa - I can set number higher than default.\nscreen scroll back mode is accessed through Ctrl-a+Ctrl-[ , and escaping it with hitting ESC couple times.\nbyobu-screen works with same keybindings, or alternatively with Alt-PgUp/Down\nInstall either with sudo apt-get install command, for instance, sudo apt-get install byobu or sudo apt-get install screen.

The thing is - that running the update-grub or update-grub2 command afterwards did not send the parameters to the kernel at startup (for some reason), but once I started to run both consecutively - it worked.\nSo, I changed GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX to something like GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=fbcon=scrollback:1024k, for example, and then run update-grub && update-grub2.\nThat seemed to do the trick.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Sublime Text 3 SublimeLinter jshint not working I just can't get jshint working on my sublime text3..\nI already install SublimeLinter package and sublimelinter-jshint..\nI also already install node.js and instal jshint modules with this command\nsudo npm install -g jshint\n\nbut it's just not working.\nhere is my sublime setting file\n{\n    \"user\": {\n        \"debug\": false,\n        \"delay\": 0.25,\n        \"error_color\": \"D02000\",\n        \"gutter_theme\": \"Packages/SublimeLinter/gutter-themes/Default/Default.gutter-theme\",\n        \"gutter_theme_excludes\": [],\n        \"lint_mode\": \"save only\",\n        \"linters\": {\n            \"jshint\": {\n                \"@disable\": false,\n                \"args\": [],\n                \"excludes\": []\n            },\n            \"php\": {\n                \"@disable\": false,\n                \"args\": [],\n                \"excludes\": []\n            }\n        },\n        \"mark_style\": \"outline\",\n        \"no_column_highlights_line\": false,\n        \"passive_warnings\": false,\n        \"paths\": {\n            \"linux\": [\n                \"/usr/local/bin/jshint\"\n            ],\n            \"osx\": [],\n            \"windows\": []\n        },\n        \"php_paths\": {\n            \"linux\": [\n                \"/usr/bin/php\"\n            ],\n            \"osx\": [],\n            \"windows\": []\n        },\n        \"python_paths\": {\n            \"linux\": [],\n            \"osx\": [],\n            \"windows\": []\n        },\n        \"rc_search_limit\": 3,\n        \"shell_timeout\": 10,\n        \"show_errors_on_save\": false,\n        \"show_marks_in_minimap\": true,\n        \"syntax_map\": {\n            \"html (django)\": \"html\",\n            \"html (rails)\": \"html\",\n            \"html 5\": \"html\",\n            \"javascript (babel)\": \"javascript\",\n            \"magicpython\": \"python\",\n            \"php\": \"html\",\n            \"python django\": \"python\"\n        },\n        \"warning_color\": \"DDB700\",\n        \"wrap_find\": true\n    }\n}\n\nI wonder anyone have a solution.\n\nA: Change \"show_errors_on_save\" from false to true; and then restart you sublime.

Since the package must come from Debian I looked on the corresponding page in Debian too. Then I looked into the file listing of the package and there it was: /usr/share/doc/ca-certificates/README.Debian\n\nHow certificates will be accepted into the ca-certificates package\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Get it included into Mozilla's trust store.\n  \n*File a bug against ca-certificates stating this fact.\n  \n  \n  With the exception of SPI (http://www.spi-inc.org/), only those CAs\n  included in the Mozilla trust store will be included in the\n  ca-certificates package in Debian.\n\nThat is the way to get you certificate accepeted into ca-certificates.\nNote from the Debian page:\n\nPlease note that Debian can neither confirm nor deny whether the\n  certificate authorities whose certificates are included in this\n  package have in any way been audited for trustworthiness or RFC 3647\n  compliance. Full responsibility to assess them belongs to the local\n  system administrator.\n\nHowever there are also other packages like ca-cert that ship certificates and if you wanted to let's say provide an internal certificate for your organization through a package repository, then you could do that too if that was your question. Though recent events have shown that providing certificates this way without proper understanding of IT security concepts can be a security risk for the users and my damage you organization's reputation if these certificates are found outside of your organization and abused to sign content you didn't intend to sign. Rolling your own is a bad idea.\n", "Q: Commands and packages relationship I want to find out what commands installing a package makes available in my console.\nFor example: If I want to run the command quiz in bash, I have to install a set of packages by asking apt-get to install bsdgames.\n\nA: You can either do:\napt-file update\napt-file search quiz\n\nor directly go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and use the feature \"Search the contents of packages\". \n\nA: Open a terminal and run\nsudo apt-add-repository universe\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bsdgames\n\nto add the Universe repository, to update the package information and to install bsdgames, quiz is part of this package.\nAfter that you can run\nquiz\n\nin your terminal.\nWhy?

Only after the installation I realized that this particular option has deleted the earlier partitions and formatted the entire hard drive. I thought 'erase disk' option will format only the os installed drives. Anyhow my last four years work has been lost now :(\nIs there any way by which I could possibly retrieve the lost data? (it amounts up to 200 GB). Kindly help me. Is it advisable to consult data recovery firms?\n\nA: First of all I'm very sorry to hear that you've lost all your data in this sudden move, I've experienced the same issue with my laptop, and from what I could tell you can use some of the available recovery tools in the software center,\nI would recommended system rescue CD you can run it using CD or a USB flash good thing it is support most of the known partition format.\nYou can also use Testdisk.

When you do this, you are essentially pausing the system and saving all of that information into a file hiberfil.sys. \nMaking changes to your Windows NTFS partition - and to the file hiberfil.sys - while it is hibernated could be dangerous. Because of this, Ubuntu will not mount the partition in read-write mode if it sees a hibernation flag, and that's why Nautilus pops up that error.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 Wireless problem Today I've installed Ubuntu 15.10 and I can't using internet with wireless connection.

I've been researching this for a while now, and it appears that the reason my Ubuntu Server GUI (ubuntu-desktop) install is really slow is because of the AMD/ATI ES1000 Graphics card. I've been looking at a lot of forums and I can't find any real solutions to my problem other than installing lubuntu or xubuntu. I want to know if there is a way to make it run smoothly on Ubuntu, either by installing a new driver, or somehow turning off 3D, or anything? \nSPEC:\nHP ProLiant ML350 G6\nCPU: 8 Core 2.4Ghz\nRAM: 16035MiB\nGRAPHICS: AMD/ATI ES1000\n\nA: My 1st suggestion would be ... delete the desktop.\nSo you are running an ubuntu desktop as a server. Or a server as a desktop. But the desktop eats resources your server would like to use. The desktop depends on the AMD/ATI ES1000 Graphics card. The server depend on it a lot less. \nSo ditch the desktop and use command line and web-based tools to manage the server.\n2ndly: looking at the specs of this card... it is a server graphics card designed as an integrated solution for remote server management, it has a max of 64Mb memory and is lacking 3D support. It is NOT intended for a desktop. Not even back when it was sold, let alone an odd 10 years later.\nThat is also the reason you will not find any additional hardware for this card. \nUsing it for a desktop system is probably impossible with any type of desktop, not just Ubuntu. You really really need to ditch the desktop. Or use something else (that else might be Damn Small Linux)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 not loading GUI - problems with startx Yesterday I tried to update Google-Chrome and to install Chromium, I don't know if it is related, but after that I restarted my computer and now it does not load the graphic interface. I can log in through ctrl + alt + f4, however if I try to run startx it gives me a black screen.\nDoes anybody have any idea of what to do?\n-- purging Chrome makes no effect. Problem is with startx. However, once again, as much as I have tried following other topics, no results so far.\n\nA: Sounds totally weird. \nI would switch to runlevel 2 and purge chromium...reboot.\nIf the problem still occurs, again runlevel 2 and purge google-chrome.\nTell me/us what happened.\n", "Q: Unable to start apache2 as it throws an error I have very limited knowledge in Ubuntu and I'm getting an error when I try to start the apache2 server (seen below)\nroot@ns3016274:/etc/apache2/sites-available# sudo service apache2 start\n * Starting web server apache2                                                                                                 (98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80\n(98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80\nno listening sockets available, shutting down\nAH00015: Unable to open logs\nAction 'start' failed.\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n *\n * The apache2 instance did not start within 20 seconds.

How do I connect bluez-alsa to an audio device?\n\n\n*\n\n*It works with pulseaudio so I know it works, generally speaking. \n\n*I need it to work with bluez-alsa so that I can use it with WINE to play video games with a bluetooth headset. :-)\n\n*bluez-alsa is installed already.\n\n\nA: I was under the impression that ALSA didn't support Bluez5 and I didn't gather from your other post that you're running Bluez4. So you may have some problems or other work to do. That being said I'll give you the general idea of using alsa and Bluez4. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go through your usual pairing and get the device's address or use bluetoothctl/hcitool:\n$ hcitool scan\nScanning ...\n    XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  NAMEOFHEADSET\n\n$ bluez-simple-agent XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n\n\n*Next edit /etc/asound.conf (system-wide) or ~/asound.conf (userlevel)\npcm.btheadset {\ntype plug\n slave {\n   pcm {\n       type bluetooth\n       device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n       profile \"auto\"\n   }\n }\n hint {\n   show on\n   description \"BT Headset\"\n }\n}\nctl.btheadset {\n  type bluetooth\n}\n\nIf this gives you any trouble you can try changing the first line to pcm.!default { which will force this to be the default audio device.\n\n\n*Reload alsa so that it picks up the changes in asound.conf and check that the device is added.\n$ sudo alsa reload\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart\n$ aplay -L\n\n\n*Test out your sound!\nAs a closing thought here, did you decide to switch to alsa directly because you've had problems with specific wine applications? Normally the Pulseaudio-alsa is good enough for most games etc. that you'd run in wine and unfortunately the entire Linux audio stack is what keeps a lot of game developers away from Linux entirely so keep that in mind too.\n", "Q: Where does \"The program '' is currently not installed.\" get its program list from? When running the command quickly I get this output:\nThe program 'quickly' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install quickly\n\nHowever when running:\napt-cache policy quickly\n\nI just get:\nN: Unable to locate package quickly\n\nSo therefore as the package quickly isn't in the repositories, where is the thing which tells me how to install a not currently installed program when I type a command that would belong to it getting its list of applications from? How does it get its list of programs and where from? Even if this is just an error, it reveals some of the workings of this program as it shows that it's not just looking at the package list which is downloaded with sudo apt-get update, otherwise it would know that the program does not exist. Also, is this just built-in functionality in gnome-terminal or is the thing responsible for the helpful message a separate application which can be uninstalled?\n\nA: At the end of /etc/bash.bashrc you'll find some commands which ultimately define the bash function command_not_found_handle. Then man bash tells us that this command is invoked when a non-existing command is typed in. On my machine, the handle invokes /usr/lib/command-not-found as a python script. This again leads into /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/CommandNotFound/CommandNotFound.py which seems to invoke apt-get or aptitute (search for the two in the file).\n", "Q: Free VmWare on Ubuntu Desktop I am looking for a free Vmware ESX to install on my Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS on my laptop.\nI want to install another Ubuntu Server, or Windows Server Operation System on VmWare.\nWhat is a stable, and free version of Vmware that I can install on Ubuntu desktop?\nI really appreciate your answer.\nFebruary M\n\nA: VMWare ESXi is a bare-metal hypervisor.  What this means in practice is that you install the software on an Intel based PC - usually of a server type specification such as a Xeon Processor.  The software is NOT designed to co-exist with anything else on that PC.  Thus you are unlikely to be able to dual boot ESXi and Ubuntu on the same PC.\nThe software does not have a GUI per-se and is not designed to be installed within another virtualisation solution such as virtualbox or Windows Hyper-V.\nTo create and install virtual machines you require another PC such as your laptop with VMWare vSphere client installed connected in a TCPIP local network to the ESXi hosted PC.  There is no Linux variant of the full vSphere software.  If you want to control ESXi via a Ubuntu desktop you need to control via a browser and VMWare Web Client.\nESXi is \"free\" but you need to obtain a license from VMWare themselves to keep running the software beyond the evaluation period.\n\nThe other type of software offered by VMWare is a type-2 (non-bare metal) virtualisation software called VMWare Workstation and VMWare Player.\nThere is no such thing as a \"free\" VMWare Workstation - you need a license and pay lots of money to VMWare.\nIf you want to use the \"free\" VMWare Player you should be aware that you can only use this in a non-commercial environment - i.e. home-use.  For a business you need to buy a license from VMWare themselves.\nThe \"free\" virtualisation software VMWare Player is available from VMWare themselves.  This software is installable on Ubuntu.  Thus - if you are looking to install a VMWare virtualisation solution within Ubuntu - you should consider either VMWare Player or VMWare Workstation.\nBoth products are downloadable from the VMWare website.\n", "Q: Is there software to periodically start and close an application? Exemplary use case:\nI would like to start Telegram Desktop periodically every 3 hours for 15 minutes, to check for newly incoming messages. After 15 minutes, the application should close again and re-launch after the next 3 hours.\n\nA: Cron versus background script\nOf course the very first thing that pops into the mind is to use cron. Whether you use cron, or a small background script is mainly a matter of taste.\nThe advantage of cron is that it hooks up on an existing process (although a script adds, well, actually nothing to the processor load). \nThe advantage of a background script is that is more flexible; simply kill it and run it with other arguments if you'd like to change time- or other settings. You can also re- use it with other applications without having to do another setup, just a command is enough.\nThe script below can be run by the command (e.g.)\npython3 <script> <command_to_run_application> <cycle_time> <application_run_time> force\n\nWhere the last argument, if set, forcefully kills the application. If not set, the application will close gracefully, to make sure possible changes etc. will not be lost.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\nforce = False\nargs = sys.argv[1:]; app = args[0].replace(\"'\", \"\")\nproc = app.split()[0].split(\"/\")[-1]\ncycle = int(args[1])*60; run = int(args[2])*60\n\ntry:\n    if args[3] == \"force\":\n        force = True\nexcept IndexError:\n    pass\n\ndef get_pid(proc_name):\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output(\n            [\"pgrep\", proc_name]\n            ).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\ndef kill(pid, force):\n    if force == False:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", \"-s\", \"TERM\", pid])\n    elif force == True:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", pid])\n\nwhile True:\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", app])\n    time.sleep(run)\n    pid = get_pid(proc)\n    if pid != None:\n        kill(pid, force)\n    time.sleep(cycle - run)\n\nTo use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as cycle_run.py\n\n*Run it with the command:\npython3 /path/to/cycle_run.py <command> <cycle_time> <application_run_time> force\n\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*<command> is the command to run the application (without the --%u -section, in my case, copied from the .desktop file: /home/jacob/Downloads/Telegram/Telegram)\n\n*<cycle_time> is the (total) cycle time in minutes (3 hours = 180 in your example)\n\n*<application_run_time> is the time the application should run in minutes (15 in your example)\n\n*force is an optional argument, to forcefully kill the application. Simply leave it away to gracefully kill the application.\n\n\n\nRunning applications with arguments\nIf you run an application with arguments, make sure you use quotes around the command to run the application, e.g.:\npython3 /path/to/cycle_run.py 'gedit /home/jacob/Desktop/test.sh' 30 5\n\nRunning applications minimized or in tray\nStarting and terminating applications periodically will often be needed only minimized and/or in tray. As requested by OP, a few remarks on that:\n\n\n*\n\n*If an application offers starting up in tray from command line, simply use the argument to do so. In the case of Telgram, the argument to use is:\n-startintray\n\nalthough the option seems not to work on all systems (it does on mine), as mentioned here. You will have to test in your situation.\n\n*If the application does not offer the command line option to startup minimized or in tray, I'd suggest using the (this) script in combination with the one here (I'd suggest the pid- version), which will make it possible to startup the application minimized.\n\nA: *\n\n*Edit your cron with crontab -e\nand add this line into your crontab to run it as schedule job for every 3 hours\n00 */3 * * * * ~/killtelegram.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 \n\n2.Open your terminal and type below command \ntouch ~/killtelegram.sh\nchmod +x ~/killtelegram.sh\n\nopen killtelegram.sh with your favorate editor and write as below\n#!/bin/bash\ntelegram &\nsleep 15m\npkill telegram\n\nSave and exit\nthats it. It will open automatically for every 3 Hours and it will stay for 15 min and It will get killed.    \n", "Q: How do I find the right ubuntu kernel for an i686 CPU? I burned a copy of Ubuntu to dvd, I went to install it on an Acer Aspire 5610z which had vista. I removed vista and put xp on it about 3 or 4 years ago. My problem is that I now have a black screen with the following two lines of text at the top:\n\nThis kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU.\nUnable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU\n\nMy question is how and where do I find a version of Ubuntu that will work with my CPU?\n\nA: There exist several possible options to handle this problem. Since your reputation is low I'll assume you're not very experienced and this solution is quite easy. Go here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/15.04/release/ and download the 32 bit version. Those are the files with '386' as part of the name. It is highly likely that the 32 bit version will run on your system without problems.\n\nA: Use the 'i386' version of the kernel instead of 'amd64'. Sorry to tell you but you will have to get another copy of Ubuntu, this time with i386 architecture. i386 is compatible with i486, i586 and i686, like in your case.\n", "Q: I accidentally deleted boot option while trying to change boot order? Ok, I have an Asus x55la-hi31103j and it came with windows 10 installed but i didnt like it so i made a bootable usb wit linux ubuntu and installed that without problems. after a few days i decided to install windows 7 ultimate with bootable usb as well but it wouldnt work. it wouldn't boot on start up even when i changed the boot order.I even tried open the usb and clicking on setup..it would say could not find location to store temporary files, or something like that. Long story short while trying to figure out how to install windows 7 i accident deleted all the boot options..now my computer wont start up and i cant find a way to restore the boot options. But i did find if i put in the usb with linux loads up te grub prompt? when I put ls all it shows is (memdisk) (hdo) and (hd0,msdos1)..i tryd fallowing direction to bot from the grub prompt but i guess the disk doesnt have the file i need? is supposed to say (hd0,gpt1) or something like that....ultimately i just want to install windows 7 or if i cant re install ubuntu....help plz!!!!\n\nA: To install ubuntu download the latest version.  You should choose the 64 bit version for computers of today.  I don't know if they still make 32-bit computers.  If you have one it would be pretty old, probably more than 15 years old.\nYou might consider the LTS version which is supported for 5 years.  Currently the latest LTS is version 14.04.  The other versions that are not LTS are supported for 1 year.\nBurn the downloaded ISO file and boot to it.  Follow the prompts for installation.  If you have data on the drive that you want to preserve (such as a Windows installation), use the option to do something else.  Pick a partition that isn't your Windows partition and install to that partition.\nOnce installed, the install process will provide the grub boot manager which will discover all your other Linux and Windows installed on that drive as well as any other drives that are attached to the computer and provide a boot menu to select which OS you want to load at boot.  It will default with a 10 second timeout to the latest Ubuntu installation.\nEnsuring an installation partition\nIf you don't have a partition available for your fresh Ubuntu install you can create one.  When you boot to the DVD, choose the option to try Ubuntu.  Run gparted  (the partition editor) to create a new partition.  This application also has an option to change the size (shrink) a partition to make space for a new partition.\nMake sure you have sufficient space to create a new partition for your Ubuntu installation.  Then click on the open (on the desktop) to install Ubuntu.  Select the newly created partition for your install drive.\n", "Q: 1045 Error using mysql -u root i didn't find my answer on similiar questions so i ask my question here :\nI've followed the instructions on ApacheMySQLPHP page on help.ubuntu.com\nbut after the installation of MySQL & using the command mysql -u root on sudo su - mode it gave me this :\nERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)\n\nWhat is the problem ?\nI'm using ubuntu 14.04 LTS if it's useful...\nThanks all.\nEDIT : I reinstalled the package after i got the 1045 error when setting the password on setup process but no useful result...\nEDIT2 : The only change is NO to YES... :|\nEDIT3 : Do i need to reinstall or reset the password ?\n\nA: When the MySQL server is installed you are usually asked to set a password for the root user.\nSo, when you're trying to login you should provide it as well with the -p option.\nThe correct command in your case is mysql -u root -p\n\nA: After installing MySQL, you need to initial the password for root user by the command:\nmysqladmin -u root password <newpass>\n\nAnd to access you will have to use the command:\nmysql -u root -p\n\n", "Q: Recovering a half-encrypted disk Recently I filed a bug against what, from my perspective, was a majorly annoying bug with the Ubuntu installer.\nIt would appear, however, that my troubles installing Ubuntu are not related to Ubuntu but rather that when trying out an installation of Manjaro Linux a few days ago, I accidentally selected \"Encrypt disk\" and \"Use LVM\", and I assumed that a simple fresh partition table would make the encryptedness go away.\nNow that I've tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 with Ubiquity crashing in the same place, I see that there's obviously an error with the disk in some way.\nIt's not physically damaged, as far as I can tell from the SMART status (included below), and gparted doesn't complain about IO errors formatting or writing the disk.\nI've also verified the hashes and integrity of all the many LiveCDs I used.\nAssuming that the encryption is the issue, what can I do to recover my disk so that Ubuntu will install?

As a disclaimer this really does a full wipe making anything there impossible to recover!  For HDD's you'd use dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX but appears you've got an SSD so it's a tad more involved.\nStart by checking that security is not enabled (FYI: this all must be done as root/sudo and I'm using /dev/sda as that's what your output above shows.  You can replace that with whatever the drive in question is.):\n# hdparm -I /dev/sda\n[...truncated...]\nSecurity: \n    Master password revision code = 65534\n            supported\n    not     enabled\n    not     locked\n            frozen\n    not     expired: security count\n            supported: enhanced erase\n    2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT. \n\nThat not enabled line means we can proceed with ease, we now enable security:\n# hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass tempPassword /dev/sda\n\nThe password doesn't matter it'll be cleared too. Let's do a quick sanity check to make sure that worked.\n#hdparm -I /dev/sda\n[...]\nSecurity: \n    Master password revision code = 65534\n            supported\n            enabled\n[...]\n\nIt now says enabled, so we can now perform the actual wipe:\n# hdparm --user-master u --security-erase tempPassword /dev/sda\n\nOne last sanity check with # hdparm -I /dev/sda should reveal a not enabled like in the first check.\nReference: What is the recommended way to empty a SSD?\n", "Q: Cant change permission to write a file I wanted to modify some files in /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo.

Is there any way to modify those files?\n\nA: Open nautilus (I suppose you're using nautilus as the file manager since it's default in Ubuntu) as root. To do it, open a terminal and run\nsudo nautilus /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo\nYou will need your admin password. Nautilus will open and you will have root privileges.

I started adding a new printer. The tool detected the printer letting it appear on the list and suggesting an LPD/LPR and a AppSocket/JetDirect connection. I chose the latter. The driver wizard pointed me to a Brother DCP-1510 driver. Although not quite my printer model, using that driver, I was able to use the wireless printer as far as I needed it. Done for me!\nHope to have helped. \n", "Q: Firefox slow at loading websites on Ubuntu 14.04 I am having a little problem with Firefox on my Ubuntu, and I was wondering if someone could help me. The problem is that my Firefox started to act very slow after the v43.0 update. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit.\nEvery page that I try to open takes about 5-25 seconds to load, and sometimes it doesn't load at all (displays that connection was restarted, or blank tab). I tought it was problem with my OS, so I started up Windows Vista in virtualbox with Firefox v42 (it wasn't updated yet), and went to compare it. And really the Firefox 42 on my Vista in Virtualbox was A LOT faster when opening pages (almost instantly) than Firefox 43.0 on my host OS - Ubuntu.\nThen I updated the Firefox on Vista virtualbox from 42 to the version 43.0.2., and it was OK, the speed was the same. So no problems on the Virtualbox with the 43. But on host OS, my Ubuntu 14.04, Firefox 43.0 is very slow when loading any page. I read something about nvidia network manager on Firefox reddit, but I am not sure if I do have that program on my Ubuntu. I have laptop with optimus technology and I am using only Intel GPU, so Nvidia should not be the problem, right?\nI also checked for updates, to see is there Firefox v43.0.2. for Linux also, but no new updates were found. I am huge fan of Firefox, but this is annoying, browsing the web is simply imoposible. It's even worse when you know that everything it's working fine on Virtualbox, but not on host OS. I tried opening my test pages on Ubuntu browser (based on Chromium) and it worked ok, the load speed was almost the same as on virtualbox. So that leads me to the conclusion - is it something wrong with Ubuntu or Firefox, and can it be fixed?\nNote: The problem is that Firefox is slow to \"contact\" the site. It's like it is testing does website even exists, or does the connection works or something like that. After that, when the name of the site appers in the tab, it loads quickly web content. So the problem is in contacting the page, beacuse sometimes it showes nothing, just blank tab, or error message: \"Connection was restarted\".\nI would really be greaful for any help. Thanks!\n\nA: The update with Firefox version 43.0.4 seems to solved the problem.\nThanks everyone who helped :)\n", "Q: SSD partitioning for Ubuntu Gnome Being rather new to Linux, I need the opinion(s) of more experienced users in some matters like choosing a partitioning scheme for my system. My distro of choice is Ubuntu Gnome (only OS installed at the moment) and my system is a laptop (HDD is a 500 GB SSD).\nAt the moment I have a boot partition (~250 MB) and an extended partition with the rest of the space on the HDD (created during the installation of the OS).\nTo divide the extended partition, I believe I'd have to unmount it first (which doesn't seem feasible while running the OS from it), so I am thinking to make a bootable USB with GParted and boot from it and partition from there. Does this sound right? \nAs partitions, I'm thinking to create a swap partition as well (although ubuntu gnome strangely didn't make one when I installed it and it seems to be working fine without it), with the same size as my RAM memory; next a 30-40Gb partition (root/) for the system files and for the rest a partition for the /home folder, with system/application dependent config, data and other files (pictures, movies, music).\nDoes this seem right to you guys? Any thoughts or suggestions? \nThank you for any opinions/suggestions & merry Christmas everyone! :)\nAlin \n\nA: To repartition, gparted on a USB stick is the way to go.  Not only does it repartition, but it also grows/shrinks the filesystem within the partition (i.e. it understands the FS internal structure just like fsck would).  And, doing it the other way [live] won't work.\nA given kernel version takes up about 33MB per rev [with vmlinuz* and initramfs*], so your /boot should be okay.\n40 MB for the root partition is also good.  I've got a 60 GB partition for that, and I have a fair number of programs installed, but I'm only using 33 GB.\nThere's some controversy about what is adequate swap.  Some say just a few GB, regardless of RAM size, but the \"old school\" [and mine] metric was 2X the RAM size because of the way older Unix kernels had to handle swapin/swapout.  I'd say minimally at least the RAM size.  Depends on how much RAM you have.  With 4 GB of RAM, I'd definitely add swap.  With 24 GB of RAM, you may be able to skip the swap altogether.\nI have large raid HDs, and I occasionally run the odd batch number cruncher program that will use way more memory than I have RAM, so I have about 120 GB.  That may be the deciding factor on how large to go (e.g. accomodating whatever \"memory hog\" programs you intend to run)\nHowever, one thing [for you] to consider is the fact that you've got an SSD.  If it's flash, putting a swap partition on it may strain the flash's wear leveling, etc.  Flash has gotten better about this, so the answer may depend on the specs of your particular SSD.  Normal FS access is usually \"write once\", \"read many\", so it doesn't \"pound on\" the device nearly as much.\nWith SSDs made from alternatives to flash, such as Intel's \"3D XPoint\" technology [probably not yet available--but soon], they don't have the wear leveling problem.\nAlso, when you've got the system fully configured, consider editing /etc/fstab and changing the mount options from [probably] relatime to noatime.  See the mount man page for details.  This change reduces writing to the disk when reading.  Every time you read a file, the OS updates the \"last accessed time\" [or \"atime\"] in the file's inode, causing a metadata write of this.  The noatime prevents this.\n", "Q: Eclipse crash in Ubuntu Mate 15.04 I'm currently on Ubuntu Mate 15.04 and have installed Eclipse Mars directly from the official website.\nMy Eclipse version:\nEclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers\nVersion: Mars.1 Release (4.5.1)\nBuild id: 20150924-1200\nUnfortunately, when I'm trying to use it, after clicking on some button (for example doing a right click on the C/C++ button in the top right corner) get me to a crash.\nI then get a crash report (.log) in my /home file with written :\n#\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\n#\n#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f9f09801d41, pid=14037, tid=140321501198080\n#\n# JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_66-b17) (build 1.8.0_66-b17)\n# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.66-b17 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops)\n# Problematic frame:\n# C  [libgdk-3.so.0+0x3dd41]  gdk_window_ensure_native+0x31\n#\n# Failed to write core dump.

Sadly, turning monitor mode on isn't as simple as it is in, say, OS X; you have to go through an elaborate dance involving creating new interfaces associated with the real Wi-Fi interface and setting them up as monitor-mode interfaces, and that involves netlink, and the \"easy\" way of doing netlink involves a library that has apparently changed its API 3 times, in incompatible ways, so linking libpcap with libnl is a bad idea and few if any distributions do it, so turning monitor mode on in tcpdump/Wireshark/TShark/etc. isn't as easy as \"use the -I command line option\" or \"check the monitor mode box\" or....\nSo see the Linux section of the Wireshark Wiki's \"CaptureSetup/WLAN\" page.\n", "Q: Extracting a password protected .7z file with 'p7zip' returns an error I am trying to extract a password protected .7z file with p7zip -d filename.7z command. Unlike on Windows, on Ubuntu I do not get a prompt to enter password. Instead the terminal throws an E_NOTIMPL error. Could it be that the file is corrupted? Or am I doing it wrong?\n\nA: There is a known bug/limitation in p7zip, in which it cannot work with password-protected encrypted files (technically by design as a 'lighter' kind of 7zip), and throws the error you've stated here when it tries to work with them.\nThe correct approach for encrypted/passwords 7z files is to use p7zip-full instead of p7zip, which should then work as it should.\n", "Q: `curl` outputs random characters If I run:\ncurl http://files.unity3d.com/levi/unity-editor-5.2.2f1+20151018_amd64.deb\n\nIt continuously outputs random characters, then the program completes.\nI tried reinstalling it, but to no avail.\nWorks with wget though.\n\n\nA: curl by default prints STDOUT to the terminal, hence the file you're fetching (in this case a binary file) is printed directly to the terminal.\nWhat you want is to redirect STDOUT from the terminal to a file (you can do that using Bash's > operator):\ncurl http://files.unity3d.com/levi/unity-editor-5.2.2f1+20151018_amd64.deb > unity-editor-5.2.2f1+20151018_amd64.deb\n\n\n\nA: In curl, you need to specify that you need the downloaded file to be kept intact as it was in the server, i.e, a *.mp3 will be downloaded as *.mp3 and not as the one shown in your screenshot. From curl --help:\n-O, --remote-name   Write output to a file named as the remote file\n\nSo, to download the mentioned file you just have to add -O to the command, i.e.,\ncurl -O http://files.unity3d.com/levi/unity-editor-5.2.2f1+20151018_amd64.deb\n\nHere's a screenshot to clarify things:\n\n", "Q: How can I make a write protected Ubuntu installation?

Nothing after My PC just boots up into Windows. How can I select the Ubuntu partition? It doesn't show any GRUB menu whatsoever.\n\nA: I am going to assume that you chose to restart now and your computer booted straight into Windows without giving the option for Ubuntu.\nLog into Windows and click the power icon next to your username in the top right corner.\nHold down the shift key and select to restart your computer. Keep the shift key held down until your computer reboots.\nAt the point of the UEFI settings appearing choose to boot from USB again.\nYou will now be booted back into the live session of Ubuntu.\nNow open a terminal: Ctl + Alt + T\nUpdate your grub by typing 'sudo update-grub' \nThis will detect all boot options and update them. You may now restart your computer. 'sudo reboot'\nIf the comupter still loads into Windows continue to next steps:\nRestart the computer again by selecting restart and holding the shift key to login to ubuntu live cd.\nNow open up a terminal: Ctl + Alt + T\nType the following command:\n'sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sh -c \"sed -i 's/trusty/saucy/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair'\nA boot repair screen will appear after install completes.\nClick -》 \"Recommended repair\".\nYou may receive a message stating \"EFI is detected\". This is just an informational message as far as I am concerned because it is perfectly fine to install Ubuntu with EFI turned on.\nAfter clicking \"OK\" to the EFI detected message the utility performed a few tasks and then asked me to select some text and run it in a terminal window.\nIf you are asked to do this open a new terminal window (press the \"super\" key, enter \"term\" into the Dash and click on the icon that appears).\nCopy the text from the boot repair window by selecting it with the mouse. Press CTRL and C and then right click in the terminal window and select paste.\nMake sure all the commands have run correctly. You may need to press return to get the last command to run.\nNow click on the \"Forward\" button within the boot repair application. You may be asked to copy and paste more text.\nRepeat the process of selecting all the text, press CTRL and C and then right click in the terminal window and select paste.\nMake sure the commands run.\nKeep following through on the process until the boot repair finishes.\n\nA: Disable hibernation mode and fast startup in Windows.\nOpen command prompt as administrator and execute :\npowercfg /h off  \n\nOpen the legacy version of the Windows Control Panel - not the modern one.\nSelect Power Settings - enable show hidden settings - uncheck fast startup.  \nAfter having finished - shutdown the computer completely - do NOT reboot.\nBoot into BIOS and select Ubuntu to be the default operating system to boot.\n", "Q: SystemD: Run 3 instances of MongoDB My current setup:\nmongodb\nme@server:/lib/systemd/system$ cat mongodb.service \n[Unit]\nDescription=An object/document-oriented database\nDocumentation=man:mongod(1)\n\n[Service]\nUser=mongodb\nExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nmongodb.homepage1\nme@server:/lib/systemd/system$ cat mongodb.homepage1.service \n[Unit]\nDescription=An object/document-oriented database\nDocumentation=man:mongod(1)\n\n[Service]\nUser=mongodb\nExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongodb.homepage1.conf\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nmongodb.homepage2\nme@server:/lib/systemd/system$ cat mongodb.homepage2.service \n[Unit]\nDescription=An object/document-oriented database\nDocumentation=man:mongod(1)\n\n[Service]\nUser=mongodb\nExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongodb.homepage2.conf\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nAs you can see, all three files have the same structure.\nStill mongodb starts on boot, whereas mongodb.homepage1 and mongodb.homepage2 do not.\nManual start works:\nsudo reboot\n\n# ... server reboots ...\n\nsudo service mongodb start # not necessary, because this one starts automatically\nsudo service mongodb.homepage1 start\nsudo service mongodb.homepage2 start\n\nAll 3 are running on different ports configured through their different configuration files.\nWhy don't they start on boot?\n\nA: Make sure you have enabled your 2 custom services.

I'm pretty new to this, but I'm setting up a private LAMP server for my small organization. I made a webapp that runs on Apache. Currently I can access the server on a different devices using the ip address. But I want to access it with a private domain name such as example.com. I found out that you can host a private DNS server. \nIm using this guide to help. But I dont really understand it fully yet. One problem is I dont know where the FQDN should initially be define. Should it be inside my apache server config or the DNS server that I'm trying to setup? \n\nA: \nShould it be inside my apache server config or the DNS server that I'm\n  trying to setup?\n\nYes, you should define the ServerName parameter in your VirtualHost configuration. At first, create a configuration file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ named example.com.conf and add the content:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/var/www/\"\n    ServerName example.com \n</VirtualHost>\n\nChange your /var/www/ to your DocumentRoot and add any other directories of your site in the VirtualHost configuration. And then enable the site:\nsudo a2ensite example.com\n\nRestart apache2:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nIn case, you don't want to host a DNS server, just define this in /etc/hosts of your computer and any others you want them to have access:\nIP_address example.com\n\nIf you need any further help to install a local DNS server, tell me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu: Switch from Nvidia to Intel graphics? By default Ubuntu has selected the nouveau drivers as i have an nvidia gpu. But I need to run my system on the Intel GPU instead, with Intel drivers etc. How can I do this? \n\nA: To achieve what you want, you will have to install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers and Optimus.\nAfter that you can switch between the graphics from NVIDIA X Server Settings PRIME Profiles.\nAssuming you have a NVIDIA GEFORCE 400 series adapter or newer execute these commands :  \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot  \n\nUpdate addressing your response to having problems with 352 drivers \nUse another method - first uninstall the formerly installed NVIDIA drivers.\nHighlight the Ubuntu entry in the GRUB boot menu and press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line - press F10 to boot.  \nOn login screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1 - enter user name and password - execute :\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*  \nsudo reboot  \n\nNow install the NVIDIA drivers 358 from the Proprietary GPU Drivers PPA.\nHighlight the Ubuntu entry in the GRUB boot menu and press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line - press F10 to boot.\nOn login screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1 - enter user name and password - execute :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-358 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: Nvidia settings is available in software center.\nInstall it if not already installed.\nsudo apt install nvidia-settings\n\nNow open it by running this in terminal\nnvidia-settings\n\nFrom there you will be able to select which GPU you want to use (Nvidia/Intel).\nGo to PRIME Profiles -> Select the GPU you would like to use -> Choose Intel (Power Saving Mode)\n", "Q: Disconnect user accounts from OS? Let's say I have a server with Ubuntu and 10-15 user accounts on it.\nAfter some time the server crashes with whatever reason. Of course, you could look at the back-up and reset it to the time before the problem.\nI was thinking this morning about the following ( it could be a classic example of reinventing the wheel, but I am not a sys admin for 10 years ;) ). Let's say that you could separate the user accounts from the OS. This way the server gets the account data and software from a different location and load it locally, but let's say your server base image dies. Then there is no problem, you simple spin up a different ubuntu OS and load the user accounts again.  \nQuestion: Is there software to support this? or are there different solutions to tackle this problem? \n\nA: On Linux, this typically accomplished using LDAP. Commonly used is the OpenLDAP server, with various client-side daemons like nslcd, SSSD, etc. The Ubuntu Server Guide has a section on OpenLDAP.\nWhen using LDAP, it's also common to serve home directories from a common server via NFS, etc. NFS is also covered in the Server Guide.\nOf course, if crashing is the issue, then you're just pushing the problem one level down. The difference is that when your LDAP server goes down, all your servers are effectively down.\n\nA: LDAP is the obvious and common sollution, but you should also look into Kerberos. With LDAP you basically only get contents of /etc/passwd, /etc/groups, /etc/hosts, etc. distributed, which is a good step to a solution. With Kerberos you will also get authentication distributed, with some real security, authentication of servers too. So if you log in on one machine, you don't need to log in on others and you know you logged in on the right one.\nMS AD is basicly a combination of LDAP, Kerberos and scripts and directories distributed by CIF (SMB) with some GUI on top. In Unix/Linux we have been using that for ages before AD. \nSo, if you want a proper server installation, LDAP and Kerberos is the way to go.  Have a look at the new SAMBA 4 for more information.\n", "Q: SOLVED - Microsoft Designer Mouse not connecting to Ubuntu 15.10 I've just bought a Microsoft designer mouse which uses bluetooth to connect rather than a dongle, but for some reason my laptop simply won't recognise the device. \nPairing the devices didn't work via GUI so I opened a terminal, ran bluetoothctl and then scan on but still can't see the MAC address of the mouse. \nI've done some research into this and have seen suggestions to edit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf and have also tried this but still no joy.

Most of my knowledge come from the day or 2 that took me to research what and how to install for my grandparents. I've installed Lubuntu (can't remember the version, it was few months ago) and they liked it very much because they couldn't break it too much and I was happy as well because I didn't need to repair it every other week. Few days ago they had some problem with the camera and they called some friend that was using linux to try and help them, unfortunately I gave him the administrator password and he did something. Yesterday I came to help them because the PC won't boot.\nCloser to the problem: the PC wont boot and stop at an error like \"alert dev/disk/by-uuid/***somethingLong*** does not exist\" I tried searching online but couldn't get something related. I've noticed that I get a grub menu at the start where I can chose some options and if I chose not the default \"ubuntu\" but the \"advanced options for ubuntu\"(cant remember the exact wording) there I can chose the newest version(I think its the version of lubuntu) or the newest version with safe start or the older version or the older version with safe start etc. I chose to boot the older version and the pc starts normally.\nThe problem itself: I've search how to change the default boot option in grub and found that I need to edit the grub file. I've edited the grub file but as I understand I've written the wrong values there so now the pc automatically boots into memtest(Memtest86 v4.20).\nWhat I've tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*I couldn't find a way to get back to the grub menu when the pc starts, if I restart the pc it goes again automatically to the memtest.\nIf I let the memtest run it will just run it in cycles - I don't think there is a point where it will end and go past it to load the os.\n\n*I can't load live cd from a USB - I've tried changing the boot options in the bios to usb-ffd, usb-zip, usb-cdrom and non of them boot even when I tried to stick the usb to the back usb ports of the pc or the front usb ports. By can't boot I mean it boots just as usual and going straight to the memtest, even though the usb was flashing it's lights as if the pc was reading files from it.\n\n*I couldn't load the live cd from a CD (I can't get my hands on a dvd so I found several live cds that fit into a cd) and I still cant boot. This time I get a line \"Boot from CD: \" it hangs for a few seconds then either it continue to boot to memtest or it writes something like: \"could not boot from cd insert the install cd and press enter\".

Does anyone know how to sync Xubuntu 15.10 calendar (Orage) with Google Calendar? I found some old links but it doesn't seem to work anymore.\n\nA: I believe you can modify this file /home/user/.config/orage/oragerc approximately like that:  \nArchive file=/home/user/Dropbox/orage/orage_archive.ics\nOrage file=/home/user/Dropbox/orage/orage.ics\n\nThese files are (or should be) originally in /home/user/.local/share/orage (2)\nOr you can go in Orage to File -> Share data (or data share?(1)) to change the paths of the files.\nSo, you could sync with any computer or mobile with Orage (but not Google Calendar) and your Dropbox account. However, I have not tried yet but it works with passwords manager like Keepass.\nIn any case, synchronizing an application with a Google app requires lowering the security of the Google app.\nDo you know? \"Orages\" means \"thunderstorm\" in French.\n(1)Échanger des données in the french version\n(2) If you never used Orage, they will not exist yet\n\nA: There is an interesting article here (8 april 2018 by Ayman Bagabas) that suggests using a utility, Vdirsyncer, to perform the synchronisation. vdirsyncer is a command line tool that can synchronise calendars and address books between servers and the local file system in both directions. Typically, it is run periodically through cron or a systemd service.\nSetup is not quite straightforward, and requires some technical experience. Details are outlined in the article.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a configuration file, the synchronization is set up with respect to vdirsyncer.\n\n*One needs to enable the CALDAV API for the Google account from within the Google API console.\n\n*Then vdirsyncer needs to be granted access to the Google account.\n\n*Orage must be pointed to the synchronized file\n\n*With cron or systemd, vdirsyncer is run periodically.\n\n\nIn case the article is not available in the future, some information is replicated here. Credit goes to Ayman Bagabas, the author of the article:\nPrerequisites\nHave vdirsyncer and orage installed:\nsudo apt install vdirsyncer orage\n\n1. Configuration file\nAn example of a configuration file ~/.vdirsyncer/status for vdirsyncer is given as:\n[general]\nstatus_path = \"~/.vdirsyncer/status/\"\n\n[pair calendar]\na = \"google_calendar\"\nb = \"local_calendar\"\ncollections = [\"from a\", \"from b\"]\nmetadata = [\"color\"]\n\n[storage local_calendar]\ntype = \"singlefile\"\npath = \"~/.calendars/%s.ics\"\n\n[storage google_calendar]\ntype = \"google_calendar\"\ntoken_file = \"~/.vdirsyncer/google_token\"\nclient_id = \"CLIENT_ID\"\nclient_secret = \"CLIENT_SECRET\"\n\n2. Enable CALDAV API for your google account\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to https://console.developers.google.com/ and create a new project.\n\n*Click on “Enable APIs and Services” or on the left side click on Library, then search for “CalDAV” and enable it.\n\n*Click on “create credentials” then choose “CalDAV API” for your API and select “Other” for Application type. Click next and choose a name e.g. “vdirsyncer” then click continue.\n\n*You will get your client id, stick it into your configuration file.\n\n*Click \"done\" after you get the client id then click on the credentials name and get the client secret from there.\n\n\n3. Grant vdirsyncer access to your Google account\n$ vdirsyncer discover calendar\nThis will authorize the pair calendar provided in the config file. A browser window will pop up to complete the authorization with google.\n4. Point Orage to the synchronised file\nIn Orage: File -> Exchange data, and add the files under ~/.calendars (according to the example config file above).\nSyncronisation should now work, and can be done with the command\nvdirsyncer sync\nRemains to have that command periodically run (e.g. every hour) using cron or systemd.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 Cinnamon DE menu not functioning properly Welcome fellow Ubuntu enthusiasts.  I have a rather simple yet equally irritating problem with both of my laptops running Ubuntu 15.10  with Cinnamon 2.6.13 desktop environment.  On most menu items EXCEPT Accessories, I get a right click of 3 options Add to Panel Desktop or Favorites.\nThe Accessories Menu item only right click toggles with a _ below the program item.  It does this for all items in Accessories on BOTH laptops.  One is a HP Probook with 8 gb ram and the other is a Dell Latitude D505 with 2 gb ram.  Everything else seems to work as intended.  I have searched the forums, tried uninstalling and reinstalling Cinnamon and so far haven't found a reason for this seemingly unusual occurrence.   Anyone have any ideas on how to remedy?\n\nA: ...the solution became evident to me after research and trial and error.  When having Ubuntu 15.10 with Cinnamon desktop environment installed and then adding both a top and bottom panel to the desktop, ONLY 1 panel can have customized panel size. if both top and bottom panels are re-sized, then above problem is experienced.  Top or bottom is ok BUT not both. \n", "Q: Upgrade from 14.04 to 15.04 gives error Today I tried to upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04 from 14.04.

I have tried similar questions but with no success.\n\nA: Upgrading from 14.04 to 15.04 directly is not supported. You'd have to do 14.04->14.10->15.04, which will not work, as 14.10 has reached End of Life. Last but not least, 15.04 itself will reach EoL is January 2016, which makes upgrading unworthy. \nI'd recommend staying on 14.04, and upgrading to 16.04 in due course (in summer 2016).\n\nA: If you really want to upgrade to 15.04, you will have to download the 15.04 image from here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/15.04/\nThen you will need to create a bootable USB drive with that file, and boot from it. When the installer is loaded, you will be given an option to upgrade the existing Ubuntu installation.\nThat being said, you should still back up all your files just in case, and it's probably easier if you wait for 16.04, unless you absolutely need 15.04 for something.\n", "Q: how to copy file from external hard disk to Ubuntu on my PC I am using Ubuntu mate on my PC.

I have a computer in my university office, with Ubuntu on it, ssh running, and Python. I'm connecting on it myself using ssh to run Python programs and see the output. Only command-line output, nothing fancy.\nHowever, I have this colleague I would like to allow to do the same. Unfortunately, he is not great with IT, so I wouldn't want to go through the whole process of familiarizing him with ssh. I'm looking for a simple alternative way for him to run the program and see the (command-line) output.\nRunning the program in this context means being confined to a specific folder myFolder, and do python file1.py within that folder.\nDoes Ubuntu come with apache or another web server installed? Is there another means of communication I could set up for him? He is using Windows 7.\n\nA: Of course you can install apache and try your luck from there.\nTo me, the following seems simpler:\n\n\n*\n\n*(optional) create a user account for him on the university machine. This is to \"separate\" him from your files. This is not strictly necessary but may be a good idea.\n\n*Install putty on your friend's Windows 7 machine.\n\n*Create a putty session (as described here) and put that as an icon on the desktop (or any other convenient place). Make sure you also configure user name and password. (A fancy alternative would be to use pageant for authentication)\n\n\nThis way, all your friend has to do is click on an icon and he will be presented with a console window where he can directly use the script: python file1.py\n\nA: You could set up an Ipython notebook server.\nHere are the instructions.\nThe notebooks should be relatively easy to use (for some applications even better than the terminal interface). Plus you don't have to install a SSH client on your friend's computer, or invent your own secure protocol. \n\nA: If you're already coding in Python, you could write a web front-end for your program using the http.server module in Python 3, or BaseHTTPServer in Python 2. Your program would then emit its output directly over HTTP to the remote browser. The details of how to do so are outside the scope of this site, but depending on your program it could be less than 10 lines of code.\nBear in mind that by doing this, you would lose all the authentication and authorization capability of SSH. In other words, this method doesn't allow the server to ensure that you or your colleague is the one accessing the page. If anyone else discovers the right URL, they can run your program, potentially many times in quick succession; they could crash it; they could attempt to hack it; etc. But if these risks are acceptable to you, it's probably hard to beat pure Python for simplicity.\nIt is possible to do authentication and authorization over HTTPS, of course, but then it's no longer so simple.\n\nA: Ubuntu has a package customized and pre-configured for Ubuntu that includes apache and mysql that you can install with sudo apt-get install lamp-server^. If you install that you will need to code software to do what you want to do; like a webservice where he enters a link and then sees the python output inside his browser window. I consider it overkill; unless you expect to do more with it. \nBut would it not be easier to create a script on the Windows machine that does the ssh, the execution on your server and download the output so he can see it? Seem trivial to me (well I do this all the time but do not use Windows to do this ;) ).\n", "Q: I have a resolution problem I have just installed ubuntu 14.04.3 on my laptop.It had win xp and I wanted to try something more different than windows.So I installed the os and my max resolution is 640x480 and my laptop is 1280x800.It's a Fujitsu Siemens Esprimo mobile v5535.I had another os problems on windows but I solved them really easilly.\nAny help would really be useful.\n\nA: To change your resolution open a terminal: Ctl + Alt +T\nFind your resolution modes and ouput:\n'xrandr -q'\nChange your resolution to options litsed in terminal;\nxrandr --output LVDS --mode 1280x800\nYou may  have to add a -d :0 parameter:\nxrandr -d :0 -q\nxrandr -d :0 --output LVDS --mode 1280x800\n", "Q: Bad Youtube video quality on Ubuntu 14.04 with NVIDIA card I am running Ubuntu 14.04 with an NVIDIA GTX 960 and the latest drivers.

Here are 2 traceroutes :\nfrom machine 172.16.1.6 :\ntraceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n 1  gaudi.wombats.org (172.16.1.1)  0.264 ms  0.257 ms  0.484 ms\n 2  192.168.0.254 (192.168.0.254)  1.132 ms  1.130 ms  1.122 ms\n 3  88.161.205.254 (88.161.205.254)  24.379 ms  24.837 ms  26.092 ms\n\nfrom machine 172.16.2.2 :\ntraceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n 1  172.16.2.1 (172.16.2.1)  0.338 ms  0.336 ms  0.318 ms\n 2  * * *\n 3  * * *\n 4  * * *\n 5  * * *\n 6  * * *\n 7  *^C\n\nSo although route indicates to that default is 192.168.0.254, it does not seem to apply for packets coming from 172.16.2.0.\n\nA: The trick was simple, I forgot to allow the masquerading from interface eth2. So I added the following line to /etc/ufw/before.rules (after the same line for eth1) :\n-A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.2.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nThat did the trick !\n", "Q: why I can't install libpq-dev I try sudo apt-get install libpq-dev and I got this error\nReading package lists...

It is usually a very bad idea to try to parse HTML with simple tools like regular expressions. That said, in this case, if you are sure that what you want will always be between file: and the first ,, you can use:\nwget -O - http://vodlocker.com/embed-wrdlm4dbigu4-850x450.html 2>/dev/null | \n    grep -oP 'file:\\K[^,]*'\n\nYou need the -O - to tell wget to print the html to standard out instead of saving to a file. This is then piped through grep with Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (-P) and -o to tell it to only print the matched portion of the line. The regex itself looks for file: and then discards it (\\K) and then 0 or more non-, characters ([^,]*). The 2>/dev/null discards wget's messages.\nNote that in the example URL you gave, there are three matches:\n$ wget -O - http://vodlocker.com/embed-wrdlm4dbigu4-850x450.html | grep -oP 'file:\\K[^,]*'\n\"http://77.81.98.228:8777/n2ceexa2lo4pcnokaldsf4o64qg7le7rp2xxamcxtdebwqbtaozwssfetq/v.mp4\"\n\"http://vodlocker.com/dl?op=get_slides&file_code=wrdlm4dbigu4\"\n\"http://vodlocker.com/images/vodjw_logo.png\"\n\nIf you know you only need the first one, use -m 1 to tell grep to stop after the first match:\n$ wget -O - http://vodlocker.com/embed-wrdlm4dbigu4-850x450.html 2>/dev/null | \n    grep -m1 -oP 'file:\\K[^,]*'\n\"http://77.81.98.228:8777/n2ceexa2lo4pcnokaldsf4o64qg7le7rp2xxamcxtdebwqbtaozyasfetq/v.mp4\"\n\n\nA: Using grep with PCRE (-P):\ngrep -Po 'file:\\s\"\\K[^\"]+\\.mp4(?=\",)' file.txt\n\nUsing sed:\nsed -nr 's/.*file: \"([^\"]+\\.mp4)\",/\\1/p' file.txt\n\nBoth finds the desired string between file \" and \",, also we need to match .mp4 just before \", so that other unwanted strings do not show up in the output.\nExample:\n% wget -q -O- http://pastebin.com/raw/eQFTp0cy | grep -Po 'file:\\s\"\\K[^\"]+\\.mp4(?=\",)' \nhttp://77.81.98.228:8777/n2ceexa2lo4pcnokaldsf4o64qg7le7rp2xxamcxtdebx4vta3lae5iz6e/v.mp4\n\n\n% wget -q -O- http://pastebin.com/raw/eQFTp0cy | sed -nr 's/.*file: \"([^\"]+\\.mp4)\",/\\1/p'\nhttp://77.81.98.228:8777/n2ceexa2lo4pcnokaldsf4o64qg7le7rp2xxamcxtdebx4vta3lae5iz6e/v.mp4\n\n", "Q: how to handle unwanted exiting of a command and its output in bash script I made a one liner script to auto hide a specific window when mouse is not hover over that window.

My sister just wants to reformat her laptop with Ubuntu and throw it away/electronic recycling.  I have no idea how ubuntu works and barely learned how to open the terminal.  I tried reformatting in various ways but it keeps giving me the \"/dev/sdal\" is mounted error.  And I know I cannot unmount it because that is where the operating system is being run.  Is there a way to reformat the hard drive without the live disk?  Any help would be appreciated.  Step-by-step instructions preferred.\n\nA: You can format any disk that is not mounted. \nOn an active system you can also use rm, dd, cp and cat. Examples  (Yes, these will kill your system so you are warned (and yes I left the command needed in front of these out of them on purpose):\nrm -rf /\ndd if=/dev/urandom > /dev/sd{xy}\ncat /dev/urandom > /dev/sd{xy}\ncp /dev/urandom /dev/sd{xy}\n\nThere are more methods, you can use the utility wipe, shred, the badblocks command, or scrub.\n{xy} are the device letter and number (ie. sda1, sda2 etc).\n\n/dev/urandom is a bottleneck. I found this on u&l from Gilles <3\nopenssl rand $(</proc/partitions awk '$4==\"sda\" {print $3*1024}') >/dev/sda\n\nis very quick (it messes up a complete disk).\n\nAlternative: you can also format a partition from the grub rescue prompt with fdisk and parted (parted is the command line version of gparted).\n\nIf the intention is to throw away the disk: the only good method is to hammer a nail through the disk. Formatting can be made undone, a shredding tool should be used since those do more than 1 run over the whole disk writing digits at random making it impossible to restore.\nAnd to add to this: SSD's have a high failure rate in deleting data from a disk. The best erasing method for SSD's is ATA secure erase but this is buggy (Paper related to this: 12 disks, 8 have ATA secure erase, 3 of those had a buggy implementation and 1 reported the disk was cleared but the data was still there).\n\nA: You can't reformat the hard drive without booting to a different medium.\nThere are alternative methods including gui resolutions\nFor your information,while you might think it's hard, moving around the OS works much like Windows and the Mac, except I find it just a little easier.  In fact the Mac is basically Linux (Unix) with a Mac picture over it.  Microsoft Windows is growing more and more like Linux with every release.  You could remove the files from Linux much like you would in Windows.  Just click on the file explorer and systematically delete your sensitive stuff.  Your personal stuff is stored by default in your user space.  When you hit the File browser you'll be there.  You can systematically remove all your stuff from there.\nUnlike Windows and other OS' all your personal stuff will be in your home directory or a sub-folder off it.  So removing your home directory will do it for all your personal information.\nOne easy way would be to create a new user.  Log in as that user, then remove the home folder of your sister's userID.\nIf you can do it in any other OS, you'd have a great learning curb for doing it on Ubuntu.  It's extremely intuitive.\nYour object appears to want to remove the personal data from the computer.  The steps I provided would do this.  The description is to ease your mind of it being so much more different from what you are familiar with from the other environments.\n", "Q: can i move the extended pertition and resize the ext4 partition to the rest of the disk i have cloned my 60 GB hard drive to a 640 GB but i can't resize the ext4 partition because the extended partition is in the way, so i would like to know if i can move it without braking something and how to move it?? \nher is my partition\n\ni am running Ubuntu 14.04 desktop on a Lenovo G500 laptop \ni have lookit in gparted but coundt finde out how to move a partition\ni have tried to google it put could't find it, so i desidet to ask here\n\nA: You can only merge partitions that are next to each other.\nIf you want to ditch the extended partition you also will need to ditch the swap partition. That will remove the extended partition. And only after sda5 is gone you will be able to merge the unallocated with the primary. \nThis will result in 1 big disk, and you will need to recreate the swap file with the mkswap. \n", "Q: .sh files won't run, even after permission given I have had a long history of not being able to run .sh files.

Double-clicking on it won't always work. So, first, open a terminal, then open your file manager and navigate to the location of your sh script.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now, type the following command (edit the relevant parts) in your terminal:\nchmod a+x DRAG THE SH SCRIPT AND DROP IT HERE\n\nNote: As pointed out by kos, this is done, so that if at any time you wish to run it as below, then, you won't face any error.\n./path/to/script\n\n\n\n*Next, type this:\nsh DRAG THE SH SCRIPT AND DROP IT HERE\n\nIf there are any errors such as Permission Denied, then run the script as root:\nsudo sh DRAG THE SH SCRIPT AND DROP IT HERE\n\n\nA: There are two reasons why a simple script on linux may not execute:\n\n\n*\n\n*The path is not correct.\nUnlike Windows, the current directory is not in the search path of the shell. So, to call a script in the current directory, you have to specify the current directory with the dot . before the name of the script: ./script.sh. Alternatively you can specify the full path: /home/user/script.sh\n\n*The script file is missing. \nOr it is under a different path. This the same as above.\nYou can execute scripts in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*specify the name (with path) on the commandline. And - if the permissions are correct - the file will be run with the shell (if the shebang is correct) \n\n*use the shell command sh and specify the script as argument. Then, it's not necessary to specify the path, however the shell needs to be able to find the script. You would execute a script in the current directory like this: sh script.sh\n\nA: Try the command \"chmod 777 \" and then your file name.

Power on the tablet computer, access the boot menu, and boot off of the USB stick. The rest should be easy, just follow the instructions. \nNOTE: If you are planning on doing a dual boot, be careful about how you partition(divide) your disk space.

My graphic card is NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 960M 4GB GDDR5\nI installed NVIDIA video card driver following this question. And I choose the driver NVIDIA binary driver version 358.16.\n\nThe problem is, my laptop could not recover from suspend.  The laptop will show a color vertical stripes after recovery.  Then the system has no response. Ctrl+Alt+F1 etc don't work either.  I have to hard reboot the laptop.\nI realize that in the GeForce video card driver's information page, they claim that this is sort of a known issue.\n\nKnown Issues with this release:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Resuming from suspend may not be reliable on GeForce GTX 9xx boards in some configurations.\n  \n  \n  Note that many Linux distributions provide their own packages of the\n  NVIDIA Linux Graphics Driver in the distribution's native package\n  management format. This may interact better with the rest of your\n  distribution's framework, and you may want to use this rather than\n  NVIDIA's official package.\n\nTherefore, I believe my suspend problem is due to the video card driver.  Then, my question is, as the NVIDIA website mentioned, is there Ubuntu's own packages fo the graphic driver for GTX960M?  If so, where can I find them?\nI tried the first driver in the list.  The system will completely dead once a few minutes.\nMy hibernate feature also doesn't work.  I do have enough swap space.  For more than half of the time, the laptop cannot recover from hibernate and get stuck at a black screen with a flashing curse.  Therefore, I really want to solve this problem.  Otherwise I cannot carry my laptop around without turn it off.  \nSince Khalid Abu Shawarib says he have similar video setting as I do and his laptop can recover from suspend, is there any other possible issue that may cause the failure of suspend?\nA bit more information, my kernel is 4.1.0-040100-generic\n\nA: I don't have enough rep to comment. I got Xubuntu 15.10 working on my Inspiron 15 7559, which has a GeForece GTX 960M, with functional suspend mode and the ability to switch between integrated and discrete graphics.\nSee my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Graphics and sleep issues on Dell Inspiron 15 UHD\nAnother similar question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Infinite login loop with Nvidia proprietary graphics\nEdit: Removed duplicate content. I learned it is bad practice to post duplicate answers to related questions. Fixed link\n\nA: The version that Ubuntu currently ship is 352.63. There are 2 packages. The one called \"nvidia-352\" and the other is \"nvidia-352-updates\" (Most if the time they have different versions but that's not the case currently). This is Nvidia's current long-lived driver branch (aka stable driver).\nI have the same card as yours but on 15.10 and 358.16 driver. When the computer return from suspend it sometimes make artifacts in the apps that stores textures on the gpu but the computer is completly responsive.\n", "Q: Expanding space of a partition containing bootloader with gparted - how do I move the free space so that it safely can be done? I've got a problem on my hands. My disk contains /dev/sda1 which is my Ubuntu partition, /dev/sda2 which is an NTFS partition, then comes the unallocated space which I want to use to expand the next partition which is /dev/sda3 that contains a Windoze install, along with a /boot flag. The last partition is the Linux swap partition.\nHere is a screenshot of my partition layout, for an easier overlooking perspective: http://i.imgur.com/NGn1gVf.jpg\nNow, the problem is that the unallocated space is in between two partitions. I guess I must move the unallocated space to the right somehow, if it can be done, or move the sda2 NTFS partition to the left of the unallocated space, which Gparted warns me not to do:\n\nMoving a partition might cause your operating system to fail to boot.\n  You have queued an operation to move the start sector of partition\n  /dev/sda3.  Failure to boot is most likely to occur if you move the\n  GNU/Linux partition containing /boot, or if you move the Windows\n  system partition C:.\n\nI'm sure there is a simple solution to this, if so, please educate me. I'm not sure of what to do. My goal is to expand the sda3 NTFS partition to include the unallocated space, while not messing up the bootloader. That's all.\nThank you in advance! Would really appreciate you all's help on this one. Too bad Sony do not make their Android flash tool for Linux, along with other software pertaining to Android and flashing ROMs. Only reason I dual-boot.\n\nA: The unallocated space can be used for sda3.  The process involves moving the sda3 partition to the left into the unallocated space and growing it to the right.  Note that this process can take a very long time (many hours to days) since it involves moving over 15 GiB of data.\nBefore doing this, first ensure that you have a backup of all your information.  Also be sure to have bootable media standing by in case you need to restore the ability to boot.  See the GParted FAQ if your system fails to boot after moving a partition.\n", "Q: How to send the DHCP server a different hostname?(connecting to wifi with a fake computer name) I want to connect to a WiFi network without disclosing my original Hostname(Computer Name) to the network.\ni.e, I want to connect to WiFi networks with a different (fake) Hostname of my choice without altering my Computer Name.\nThank you.\n\nA: hostname newname will temporarily change your host name till the next reboot. Its the closest thing to what you want, but definitely not what you need:\nThings to note - your router may cache the old host name, so it might not help at all, depending on what you're really trying to do - but fabby's answer covers that in detail. \n\nA: I could just tell you to go look in /etc/network/if-up.d/ and add a script there to generate a random host name every time you connect to any WiFi network, and then change it back to the original using /etc/network/if-updown.d/ but will this help you?\nNo!\nBecause that still divulges your IP address, and more importantly: MAC address which is an address uniquely identifying your machine, so you should spoof that too depending on your use case. (which isn't very elaborately documented in your question...)\nAlternatively, buy this book which explains TCP/IP in detail and then you'll know as much as I know...\n;-)\n", "Q: What partitions to make If I will dual boot with Windows OS? I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Windows 10 on my PC,but I really don't know what is optimal way to partition the drive.\nI can use 4 Primary partitions. This means that I will use 2 Primary partitions for the Windows 10 OS, for Drive C: and D: . Now I don't know what partitions should I make primary for the Ubuntu 14.04 OS. I am thinking to make the following partions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directory /, Size 40 GB, File System Ext 4, Type Primary,at the beginning of the drive\n\n*Directory /boot, Size 5 GB, File System Ext 4, Type Primary,at the beginning of the drive\n\n*Directory /Home, Size 300 GB, File System Ext 4, Type Logical,at the beginning of the drive\n\n*Swap space 10 GB, Type Logical, at the end of the drive.\n\n\nI don't really know the difference between Primary and Logical partitions. I red that directory / and /boot should be Primary. I don't know if making /home and swap directories logical is going to affect the OS negatively.\nI plan to use Ubuntu 14.04 more often, than Windows 10 OS if this matters somehow.\n\nA: First of all, logical partitions can be extended to multiple partitions, while primary ones cannot.\nI always recommend to have a single partition for Linux systems. It's easier to install and you won't run out of space very soon. This often happens when you get kernel updates, for example, and your /boot partition becomes full. You will have a great work to increase its size. So it's easier to simply have one partition.\nI would recommend this setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*First partition, NTFS, Windows C: drive;\n\n*Second partition, NTFS, Windows D: drive;\n\n*Third partition, ext4, Ubuntu root partition;\n\n*Fourth partition, linux-swap, Ubuntu swap partition.\nThis way you won't have to stick with logical partitions and system maintainance becomes easier. You won't have to increase/decrease partition sizes due to \"no enough space\" errors and your partition table becomes cleaner.\nTo do it while installing Ubuntu, select Avanced Options when the installer asks for the partition scheme, select sda3, format it as ext4 and put / as its mountpoint. Then select sda4 and format it as linux-swap.\nAlso remember to install Windows BEFORE Ubuntu, otherwise Windows' bootloader will overwrite GRUB (Ubuntu's bootloader).\n\nA: What partitions you use for Ubuntu has -no- relation to another operating system.  \nIn regards to the partitions: you can make 1 disk / or you can put /, /home, /var, /etc, /boot, /usr (or any other directory) each on a partition if you want. It will all work and have no impact on the OS. Just 1 thing to remember: depending on usage / might need a minimum size. A 25Gb / should cover all scenario's. The same applies for /var: if you plan on using a large SQL database or a webserver /var might need a larger size if you put it on a partition. \nMy setup is very simple:\n/ 25Gb\n/home 10Gb\n/discworld 1Tb\ndiscworld holds all my private data. /home is empty (does not even have the directories; my user-dirs.dirs points to /discworld/Desktop (etc)). \nI re-install every 6 months and I format / and /home and I mount /discworld. \n", "Q: 15.10 64bit steam Xerror I have Ubuntu 15.10 64bit running on my laptop and have the default open source drivers installed (the proprietary drivers break my system).

However, I have no knowledge of any kind of C, so I do not know how to make a daemon loop script. I would like, inside my loop, to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if xprintidle returns more than 600,000 milliseconds\n\n*If so, then create a terminal window, and make it fullscreen, not maximized, but fullscreen(like F11)\n\n*Then, run the command matrix.\n\n\nI do not want the script to suspend or end anything, I just want it to start a terminal screensaver. \nIf there is any chance I could use xscreensaver to monitor inactivity for me and run a bash script(which would not have to be automatically run at boot, and would most likely be shorter), that would be great, but I would still need the bash script. \n\nA: There you go, it's pretty simple\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile [ 1 ]; \ndo\n  VALUE=$(xprintidle)\n  if [ $VALUE -ge 600000  ];\n  then\n      gnome-terminal --full-screen -e 'matrix'\n  fi\n  sleep 0.25\ndone\n\nTake the script above, save it in your personal $HOME/bin folder, as gnome-terminal-screensaver.sh. Make sure it is executable with chmod +x $HOME/bin/gnome-terminal-screensaver.sh. If you don't have one, create one. It is suggested to open $HOME/.profile and make sure that 3 lines bellow are uncommented:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\n#if [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n#    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n#fi\n\nNext, create $HOME/.config/autostart/gnome-terminal-screensaver.desktop file with the following contents\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/home/username/bin/gnome-terminal-screensaver.sh\nTerminal=false\n\nRemember to change /home/username to actual /home/username\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:error parsing `Gemfile`: Undefined local variable or method `urce' for Gemfile.

I know that size of a directory itself is a different thing than the sizes of the files in it.\nI think of a directory as a list of the directories and files within, hence a directory's size should be related to the number of files/directories within, with a minimum of 4096 bytes because of the block-size constraint.\nBut in my system, I have many well populated directories with 4096 bytes, and some directories which are considerably less populated that are around 10 megabytes. Can you please explain me why this happens?\n\nA: The filesystem used, and the maximum number of entities in that directory at any point in time determines the size. Once the default size reserved for the directory is exhausted, more space is allocated for the directory. However, when the number of entities goes down, the space allocated isn't automatically freed. So, if, at one point, a directory has 10 million entities, it would remain the same size if 9,999,999 of them were deleted. This leads to interesting situations like in this Unix & Linux post.\n$ mkdir foo; touch foo/{1..100000}; stat -c %s foo\n2179072\n$ rm foo/*; stat -c %s foo\n2179072\n\nThis doesn't necessarily hold for other filesystems. The ext{2,3,4} filesystems are affected. NTFS is, to a less extent. tmpfs and btrfs aren't. ZFS is rather conservative, I got an output of 2 for the second stat command.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to compact a directory on Unix & Linux\n\n", "Q: Can I hide files so that they are hidden on both Windows and Linux? I have my computer set up to use the same home folder / user profile for Linux and Windows. As a consequence I have files like NTUSER.DAT that are hidden on Windows showing up when I ls and in my file manager. Is there any way to make Linux hide the hidden files?\n\nA: Add the files you want to hide to a file named .hidden with 1 file per line inside the directory those files are. Somehing like ls {files} >.hidden will work to quickly do this. \n\n\n*\n\n*You can hide files looking from Windows with C:\\>attrib +h D:\\*.hidden /S (this will hide the .hidden file from the previous method). The directory I assumed D:.\n\n*You can hide these files from ls on Linux by adding this into your ~./bashrc:\nls () {\n  if [ -f .hidden ]; then\n    declare GLOBIGNORE=\"$GLOBIGNORE:.*:$(tr '\\n' ':' < .hidden)\"\n    ls \"$@\"\n  fi\n}\n\nThis will hide the files when using ls and ls only. It also assumes you do not already have an alias for ls. ls -l will still show them but that is just another alias.\n\nThe last command I found on superuser. Please upvote that answer ;)\n", "Q: Same script opened in three different ways produces three different results. Why? I have a sample script (credit goes to kos):\n#!/bin/bash\ncat <(cat /etc/lsb-release)\n\nI save this script as somename.sh in my home directory.\nNow, I try to open this file in three different ways:\nsh somename.sh\n\nbash somename.sh\n\n./somename.sh\n\nSo, I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are the outputs for the above commands different though they are running the same script?\n\n\n*\n\n*sh produces a Syntax error\n\n*bash outputs the desired result\n\n*./ gives a Permission Denied error\n\n\n*Why is it necessary to give the script executable permission only when running the script using ./ and not necessary in the other cases?\nThanks in advance!\nEDIT: The first part might be similar to the duplicate linked one but, I did have a second question too.\n\nA: As we discussed in the chat:\n\n\n*\n\n*sh script produces an error because calling the interpreter directly (in this case sh) ignores the shebang, and the script is run in sh; sh doesn't support process substitutions (<([...])), which are Bash-isms, so the script exits on error.\nbash script doesn't produce an error because despite the shebang being ignored the script is still run in Bash, which supports process substitutions.\n./script produces an error because script is not executable.\n\n*To run a script with ./ you must have the execute bit for your user set on the script, that's an OS' constraint.\nSo the question actually is: why doesn't bash script require  having the execute bit set for your user on script?\nThat's because when running bash script the script is read by Bash, and Bash has the execute bit set for your user.\nThat means that Bash, having the permission to execute code, can \"bypass\" the OS' constraint on that script, and all the script needs is to be readable by Bash.\n\nA: *\n\n*sh is symlink to dash shell and produces a Syntax error because there is no <( . . .) in sh syntax. It's only in bash (and in zsh and ksh if I remember correctly ).\n\n*bash outputs the desired result because it's in right bash syntax, nothing wrong there\n\n*./ gives a Permission Denied error because you basically say \"Hey, shell, look at the permissions of that file and look at the first line (the one with #!/bin/bash ) in my current directory and figure out how to run this script for me\". (side note: if you had the script in a location that is included into your $PATH variable, then you would just run myScriptName.sh and that's it, but the idea would be same, we need to check exec permissions and what interpreter to use) \nBefore you were running bash and dash and telling them to read commands from file. bash and dash are executable this time, not the script. Script now is source of commands, a parameter. Read permissions there are always set for all users, so shells will read it.\n\nA: In general sh,ash,dash,bash,csh,tcsh,zsh... are all shells with their own syntaxes and characteristics. There are some compatibilities but they are oriented [1]: a bash shell will execute a sh script but it is not said the viceversa. A sh invocation required less resources than a bash one. For one single instance it is not a problem, for thousands it should be.\nWays to execute.\nTo execute a file as a program under Linux, both if it is a script or a compiled one, it has to be set the execute bit [2] and it has to be included in one of the directories of your $PATH.  \nIf it is a script, it can be passed as argument to the relative shell (sh,bash...myfile.whatever): if it is passed to the wrong shell you can obtain a not correct behaviour and if you are lucky an error; in this case it doesn't need to be executable because it is like if you were writing the lines written inside the script directly in the new shell that you are invoking. \nTo execute in the same shell instead you can use source myfile or . myfile that are the equivalent to write line by line in the current shell the content of the script.\nLocation\nIf the executable program is not included in your path, you have to specify where it can be found.\n\n\n*\n\n*In your case the ./ means only the current directory of your shell, as well ~/myfile.whatever should address the file myfile.whatever in your home ~/ directory.\n\n*You can invoke it from another location for example with /home/$USER/dir/myfile.whatever.  \n\n*If this file is inside a directory included in your path you can invoke it with a simple myfile.whatever.   \n\n\nIn the case that the more than one executable are sharing the same name, specifying the full path will be sure about which one you are going to execute. which mycommand is able to tell you which one will be executed now (a function, an alias, a built in or the first found in your path), but it cannot say which one will be executed in a future time or from another user. If you expressly write the full path you will fix this ambiguity. It is useful to execute a specific version of a program when are installed more that one on the same time...and to avoid trojan. In a script it is always suggested to write /bin/bash instead of bash. \n", "Q: How to determine which package to install? On the Mac, since I used node to run NodeJS, so I assume I would do the same on Ubuntu (just like gcc for the GNU C Compiler).\nSo I typed node, and it says \nThe program 'node' can be found in the following packages:\n * node\n * nodejs-legacy\nTry: sudo apt-get install <selected package>\n\nSo it seemed like it would be node.\nBut then if I use apt-cache search ^node$ to search for its description, it showed nothing.  If I use apt-cache search ^nodejs$, then it would show nodejs - evented I/O for V8 javascript.\nAnd so it seemed like it would be nodejs.\n(Also, apt-cache show node didn't show anything, while apt-cache show nodejs showed a lot of info, so there seemed to be higher chance that it is nodejs.  However, what about the fact when I typed node, it said \"The program 'node' can be found in the following packages: node, nodejs-legacy\"?)\nIn this situation, how can you tell which one is the correct one?  I am less interested in knowing just which one is the correct one, but more interested to learn how to find out from the given information so far.\n--\nUpdate:\nas per @muru's request, this is the output from\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily InRelease\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates InRelease               \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security InRelease                 \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports InRelease\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/main Sources                     \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/main Sources   \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/restricted Sources    \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/restricted Sources  \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/universe Sources        \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/multiverse Sources      \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/universe Sources \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/main amd64 Packages         \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/restricted amd64 Packages   \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/multiverse Sources   \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/universe amd64 Packages     \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/main amd64 Packages  \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/multiverse amd64 Packages   \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/main i386 Packages          \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/restricted amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/restricted i386 Packages      \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/universe i386 Packages        \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/universe amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/multiverse i386 Packages \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/main Translation-en      \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/multiverse amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/multiverse Translation-en    \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/main i386 Packages    \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/restricted Translation-en    \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/restricted i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily/universe Translation-en      \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/universe i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/main Sources         \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/restricted Sources   \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/multiverse i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/universe Sources      \nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/multiverse Sources    \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/main Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/main amd64 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/multiverse Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/restricted amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/universe amd64 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/restricted Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/multiverse amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/main i386 Packages   \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com wily-security/universe Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/restricted i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/universe i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/multiverse i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/main Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/multiverse Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/restricted Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-updates/universe Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/main Sources\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/restricted Sources\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/universe Sources\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/multiverse Sources\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/main amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/restricted amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/universe amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/multiverse amd64 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/main i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/restricted i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/universe i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/multiverse i386 Packages\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/main Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/multiverse Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/restricted Translation-en\nHit http://us.archive.ubuntu.com wily-backports/universe Translation-en\nReading package lists...

On my server I have set-up 2 networks (eth1:172.16.1.0/24 and eth2:172.16.2.0/24) which should both communicate to the internet (interface eth0). Thus the server does the masquerading with ufw. /etc/ufw/before.rule thus contains the following rules :\n-A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.1.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n-A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.2.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nAll that works and from both sub-networks I can access Internet without any problem.\nNow I wish to limit the communication between both sub-networks.

It does not stop machines in 172.16.2.0/24 from accessing the computers in 172.16.1.0/24. So how do I filter the traffic between both networks ?\n\nA: You are setting up filtering to and from the machine working as the router, but nothing about how it should or shouldn't forward traffic through the router.\nTo do that, you need to set up FORWARDING rules in the firewall. I belive that ufw has support for that now, using the forward keyword.\nPlease read the documentation for ufw, like the man page, documents in /usr/share/docs/ufw or the programs web page for more information. I don't currently have an access to a computer, so I can't help you with some examples.\nBut in short. There are three different paths in a firewall that you have to handle. Packages/traffic IN to your router. Packages/traffic OUT from your router. Packages/traffic that is going through your router, that is FORWARDED by the router. They are each filtering independently by each other.\nYour examples is all about filtering traffic IN to your router.\n", "Q: Create a Bootable Windows Flash Drive in Ubuntu Is it possible for me to take a windows iso, and create a bootable USB stick while in ubuntu?

To create two separate mice, I followed the steps, mentioned in your question. It did work, but my \"normal\" mouse had some issues afterwards. Left-click did not work in some situations.\nSince you do not mention the side- effect in your question, I assume it has to do with hardware- specific conflicting functionality of both mice I connected.\nThe good news is that xdotool apparently only \"sees\" the coordinates of the \"main\" mouse, which makes it possible to lock up the cursor in one of the screens.\nTwo scripts\nBelow two scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*A script to lock up the pointer in either which one of the two screens.\n\n*A script to automate step 2, as described in your question: Configure two independent pointers\n\n1. Script to lock the cursor into one screen, in a dual monitor setup\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\n# --- set the loop time below\nt = 0.2\n# ---\n\n# screen argument should be either left or right\nscreen = sys.argv[1]\n\ndef get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output(command).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef condition(x_pos):\n    if screen == \"right\":\n        return x_pos < limit\n    else:\n        return x_pos > limit\n\ndef get_pos():\n    return [int(s.split(\":\")[-1]) for s in get(\n        [\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]\n        ).split()if any([\"x\" in s, \"y\" in s])]\n\nlimit = sorted([int(s.split(\"+\")[1]) for s in get(\n    \"xrandr\"\n    ).split() if s.count(\"+\") == 2])[-1]\nlimit = limit-3 if screen == \"left\" else limit+3\n\nwhile True:\n    pos = get_pos(); x_pos = pos[0]\n    if condition(x_pos) == True:\n        x = limit; y = pos[1]\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", str(x), str(y)])\n    else:\n        pass\n    time.sleep(t)\n\nto use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as lock_cursor.py\n\n*Run it with the screen (left or right) as argument, by either:\npython3 /path/to/lock_cursor.py left\n\nor \npython3 /path/to/lock_cursor.py right\n\n\n2. Script to automate the setup of two independent mice\nThis might be a tricky one, since I don't own a Wacom Bamboo, and I could not do a \"final test\" in a live situation. With my ordinary second mouse, it worked fine however (be it with different id- strings).\nIf it also works fine in your situation, both script could be merged to run in one call; the script below only takes action if the double- mice setup was not yet performed.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nnew_master = \"Bamboo\" \nid_string = \"Wacom Bamboo\"\n\ndef get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output(command).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef execute(command):\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\ndef find_ids(xinp_data, id_string):\n    return [l.split(\"=\")[1].split()[0]\n            for l in xinp_data.splitlines() if id_string in l]\n\nxinput_data = get([\"xinput\", \"list\"])\n\nif not \"Bamboo pointer\" in xinput_data:\n    ids = find_ids(xinput_data,id_string)\n    if not ids:\n        print(\"Wacom Bamboo seems not to be connected\")\n    else:\n        pass\n        execute(\"xinput create-master \"+new_master)\n        for n in ids:\n            execute(\"xinput reattach \"+n+' \"Bamboo pointer\"')\n\nTo use\nSimply copy the script into an empty file, save it as setup_bamboo.py, run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/setup_bamboo.py\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*I could not find another way to lock the mouse to one screen but to use xdotool. The (first) script therefore locks up the mouse with the help of xdotool. Since it runs in a periodic loop, the mouse position is corrected if it trespasses the screen's limit. The consequence is that, although effectively it works fine, you will still notice a cosmetic difference with a \"hard\" fence.\nI spent some time trying to reduce the effect, \"smartly\" increasing the loop speed whenever the mouse is near the screen's limit, or even making it dependent on the direction the mouse moves into. In the end however I came to the conclusion that the gained improvement is minimal, and simplicity of coding should be preferred.\n", "Q: Ubuntu not starting after suspend I have an HP-compaq-15s-103tx laptop with duel booted Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Windows 8.1 in UEFI Mode.\nEvery time when I try to Start my laptop after doing 'suspend', It does not boot at all. \ni.e, the usual grub does not appear, and a blank screen with just an underscore .

Any alternate ways I should try or is something wrong?\nEDIT: It is set to run as a WINE application even though I deleted WINE using apt-get purge a while ago. Can it be the problem? Maybe I should try another program to run it with. What should it be actually set as default?\nEDIT 2: I performed the compiling using:\n$ sudo g++ -o main main.cpp\nIt is a simple command-line app that has no GUI. \n\nA: If your application has no GUI (I.E. only does console output), you would not see anything because a terminal is not opened when double clicking an executable in the file manager. However, your application should run in the background.\nYou can run the executable from an existing shell by calling it with ./path/to/executable\nThe second, more complex option would be to make a desktop file to launch the application from the file ex and set it to show the terminal output.\nSuppose I have a very simple application such as\n#include <iostream>\n#include <stdlib.h>\nint main() {\n    std::cout << \"hello bob\" << std::endl;\n    system(\"read moo\"); // pause for input at the end.\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAnd I compile it with g++ foo.cpp which by default outputs an a.out file.\nThen just create a foo.desktop file containing\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Awesome App\nTerminal=true\nExec=/path/to/a.out\n\nwhich one could then set executable then double-click from the file navigator and see the terminal output.

If it's a command line program you won't be able to do a lot just by double clicking the executable in a file manager.

Currently, I am using 16.04 on an early 2014 MacBook Air model.\n\nYou can see that in the picture it says updated and then 99 seconds.\nWith charger unplugged, upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 gives me the following output:\nnative-path:          BAT0\nvendor:               SMP\nmodel:                bq20z451\npower supply:         yes\nupdated:              fr. 01. jan. 2016 kl. 21.29 +0100 (1 seconds ago)\nhas history:          yes\nhas statistics:       yes\nbattery\n  present:             yes\n  rechargeable:        yes\n  state:               charging\n  warning-level:       none\n  energy:              19,2888 Wh\n  energy-empty:        0 Wh\n  energy-full:         48,1992 Wh\n  energy-full-design:  54,34 Wh\n  energy-rate:         7,3112 W\n  voltage:             7,868 V\n  time to full:        4,0 hours\n  percentage:          36%\n  temperature:         32,8 degrees C\n  capacity:            88,6993%\n  technology:          lithium-ion\n  icon-name:          'battery-good-charging-symbolic'\nHistory (charge):\n  1451680147    36,000  charging\nHistory (rate):\n  1451680164    7,311   charging\n  1451680147    24,183  charging\n\n\nA: After working with you in chat it was determined that the plugin was correctly installed and it was working as it should. The minor issue is that the Battery Indicator icon can take anywhere between 2 - 5 minutes to update. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nUnder older versions of Gnome you were able to follow the steps below to change some of the power-manager settings. However that has been dropped in version 3.1.4. (Further info can be found here.) \nI suggest you try using the \"dconf editor\". BE VERY CAREFUL while using it! \nsudo apt-get install -y dconf-editor\n\nAfter installing \"dconf-editor\" have a look at the section \"org\" -> \"gnome\" -> \"power-manager\" -> \"icon-policy\"... this also changes the behavior of the battery-icon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTo solve the problem, it is suggested that you use the Unity interface under your system settings to change anything that need be. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe addition of indicator-power in Ubuntu overrides the need of power-manager\n\nA: You could try this:\nplymouth reactivated lsb\nplymouth reactivated updates lsb\nsudo -i\nplymouthd\nplymouth-upstart-bridge\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n\nA: Adding acpi_osi= as a kernel parameter fixed the issue.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server some sort of deadlock I've made some changes recently to set up my network slightly differently in the home-brew data centre. I had the machine hooked up via PowerLine but my RCD seems to heavily interfere and the speeds were entirely inadequate once I started streaming 1080p video over the line. Now I've switched to Wifi and I was getting much better speeds, but I have broken the configuration of my networking.\nCurrently, on boot, the machine tries to do two things. Firstly, it tries to connect to the network. This fails because the gateway is wrong (it's set to the former 192.168.0.1 gateway, but it's now on a DMZ which is on the 192.168.1.1 gateway. This (I believe) is why the network setup fails. However, I had some network shares to be mounted on the machine (it's a build server, and needs access to all sorts of junk). Mounting those network shares with a broken network configuration appears to throw the machine into some very ugly state from which it can't recover.\nSadly, booting into recovery mode doesn't seem to work. I cannot edit anything due to read only file system, and anything which re-mounts in read/write also enables networking - derp.\nI don't know if it's possible to (or more to the point, how to, since it's most likely possible) mount the file system in read/write mode. I'd need to do this from a root terminal (the one you access from recovery menu) I guess. I also need a method of doing this which does not also attempt to connect network drives or to try mount the network share.\nThis is a headless machine, naturally, so everything has to be done via terminal. It smells to me like my only remaining option might be to mount the SSD in another machine and edit it manually. While this is a feasible approach, I'd like to refrain from doing it because it puts me in a difficult situation having to take another server offline (one which the Mrs is utilising right now to catch up on some Loose women over Christmas - I do treasure my manhood).\nAny/all suggestions welcome!\n\nA: Feeling like a bit of a wally, I discovered that it's very easy to remount and get access to write to the file system by running the following very simple command.\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nOnce the file system is mounted, naturally you can do whatever you need to and disable network devices etc.\n", "Q: How to properly install steambp I'm new at Ubuntu and very eager to learn the ropes. I´m having a bit difficulty working the Terminal though. I'm running Ubuntu 15.10.\nI am trying to install this awesome GRUB modification https://github.com/LegendaryBibo/Steam-Big-Picture-Grub-Theme/blob/master/README.md\nNow it tells me to install it by running the install.sh through root in terminal, I've managed to get root, but I have no idea how I go about installing the script. If anyone could tell me the exact way to do so that'd be great, the Readme is a bit lacking in information for starting people. I did install the font needed though.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The commands to install it from the directory it is saved:\ncd ~/Downloads\nunzip Steam-Big-Picture-Grub-Theme-master.zip\nsudo -i\ncd ~/Downloads/Steam-Big-Picture-Grub-Theme-master/\nchmod 755 install.sh\n./install.sh\n\n(it requires root).\nThe install script will install files to a new directory \"SteamBP\" in one of these directories, in the 1st one it finds: /grub /boot/grub /boot/grub2 and the grub version on the system needs to be at least 1.98.\nThere are 3 settings in the install.sh you can edit prior to installing:\nTheme_Name=\"SteamBP\"            \nTheme_Definition_File=\"theme.txt\"\nTheme_Resolution=\"any\"  \n\nThe 1st notice that all is going well will be a question regarding the resolution if the last option is set to \"any\".\n\nProof:\n\n", "Q: Which VPN to choose? I need to setup a VPN which is compatible with iOS devices (IPSec / L2TP / IKEv2, no PPTP please). My requirements are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encrypted connection to a single server (with a critical application on it that should not be exposed to the internet)\n\n*Only traffic to this specific server shall go through the VPN, traffic to other sites shall not be routed through the VPN\n\n*Multiple clients should be able to connect to VPN to use the app on the server\n\n*Those clients have dynamic IP-addresses\n\n*They don't need to \"see\" each other but if they do it wouldn't be a problem\n\n\nI've read a lot in the last days but the combinations and possibilities for VPNs seem to be endless. StrongSwan has some nice configuration examples, but none seem to match my requirements. I don't need a tunnel or bridge sites. A lot of tutorials show how to setup a L2TP over IPSec VPN to access the internet (e.g. from behind the great firewall) but that's not very helpful in my case.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I need L2TP for this use-case? \n\n*Can't I just use IPSec in transport mode?\n\n*How would I setup IPSec authentication?\n\n*Would IPSec in transport mode allow multiple clients?\n\n*Can IPSec transport mode work with dynamic IPs of the clients?\n\n\nAny hints or directions what to read next or what technologies to use are welcome. A configuration example even better :) \n\nA: Yes, IPSec in transport mode will fit your needs quite nicely and has no problem with multiple clients with dynamic addresses.  In my experience, it is also faster and more efficient than other protocols, and once set up, never requires manual connect/disconnect actions when you want access to the server.  The down side though, is that I have yet to find any decent configuration tools so figuring out how to set it all up on the command line can be a bit of a PITA.\nYou will need to install the IKE client/server daemon racoon and configure it so that when clients want to connect, they can call up the IKE server, provide suitable authentication ( password, RSA, or x.509 ), and generate and configure the session key.\nSee http://www.ipsec-howto.org/\n", "Q: Copying to USB pen drive slows everything Every time when I copy large files from my laptop to any pen drive (USB) on my Ubuntu 14.04, all processes slow down.

So is there like any software which will give me a mouse in there so that I can select text etc? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: GPM is just the application you are looking for! It stands for \"General Purpose Mouse\":\n This package provides a daemon that captures mouse events when the system\n console is active, and delivers events to applications through a library.\n .\n By default, the daemon provides a 'selection' mode, so that\n cut-and-paste with the mouse works on the console just as it does\n under X.\n\nAnd can be installed by running:\nsudo apt-get install gpm\n\n\nScreenshot:\n\nFYI: I have put a red box around the mouse just to make it obvious where and what it is.

In a nutshell, my problem is that my TV is overscanning and I have nothing like a \"Screen Fit\" option in the TV.\nThe TV is a Samsung model LN32R71B that I believe is providing a corrupted EDID file, as my /var/log/Xorg.0.log file contains an \"Indeterminate output size\" line related to this EDID file. Also, xrandr says that the output HDMI1 (this TV) has size 160mm x 90mm, but I think it should be 710mm x 400mm, because it is 32'' and 16:9 (see this Wikipedia entry). Moreover, the resolutions that xrandr shows for HDMI1 are completely different from the ones supported by the TV (as seen on its manual). I tried to manually use different officially supported resolutions without success, for instance, by doing:\ncvt -v 1360 768 60.015\nxrandr --newmode \"1360x768_60.01\"   84.75  1360 1432 1568 1776  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode HDMI1 1360x768_60.01\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --mode 1360x768_60.01\n\nAlso, I tried using gtf instead of cvt, but it did not work.

This is a fine command-line program.\nFor example, with calcurse -a you can display the events for the day.\nHow i can send this info to notify-send, to show a notification on the desktop?\n$ calcurse -a | notify-send\n\nwill not work ...\n\nA: About Calcurse\nAs often, reverting to a (very) basic, but nevertheless complete functionality feels weird, but in a way refreshing. Not sure if I would use it though.\nAlthough the bottom of Calcurse's window suggests an option to pipe, and Calcurse's website mentions \"user-configurable notification system\" I couldn't find a way to use it for automatic scheduled notifications of all events.\n\nAt the same time: indeed such a reminder functionality would be a useful addition. The script below can be used as a plug- in for calcurse to show reminders. I hope you find it useful. \nIt is extremely easy to use; simply run the script in the background. All it does is check the events for today (updated twice per minute), and run notifications at an arbitrary time before expiration.\nWhat is needed to create reminders\nThe output of the command:\ncalcurse -a \n\nlooks like:\n12/29/15:\n * Free today!\n - 12:00 -> ..:..\n    See if this script does its job :)\n\nIt immediately occurs that the scheduled items start with a \"-\", while items for all day start with \"*\". What we need to do is create two groups (lists) of items:\n\n\n*\n\n*the scheduled ones\n\n*the unscheduled ones\n\n\nOf the first category, we need to parse out the time, convert it into a format we can calculate with, so we can show reminder at n- minutes before expiration.\nSubsequently, we need to \"keep an eye on the clock\", to compare the set time (of the event) to the current time. If the time span between the two enters the set warning time, simply show the notification.\nFinally, to prevent repeated notification, we need to add the item to a \"done\" list.\nAdditionally, the script cleans up the \"done\" list; if an item does not occur in today's items anymore (either if you removed it or the day switched during your session), the items are removed automatically.\nThe result\nOn startup (log in)\n\n\n*\n\n*the script shows all today's items, in succession:\n \nOn an arbitrary time before expiration (in this case 15 minutes)\n\n\n*\n\n*the scripts reminds you in a notification:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\nwarn = int(sys.argv[1])\n\ndef get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output(command).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef convert(t):\n    # convert set time into a calculate- able time\n    return [int(n) for n in t.split(\":\")]\n\ndef calc_diff(t_curr, t_event):\n    # calculate time span\n    diff_hr = (t_event[0] - t_curr[0])*60\n    diff_m = t_event[1] - t_curr[1]\n    return diff_hr + diff_m\n\ndef cleanup(done, newlist):\n    # clean up \"done\" -lists\n    for item in done:\n        if not item in newlist:\n            done.remove(item)\n    return done\n\ndef show_time(event, s = \"\"):\n    # show scheduled event\n    hrs = str(event[0][0]); mnts = str(event[0][1])\n    mnts = \"0\"+mnts if len(mnts) != 2 else mnts\n    subprocess.call([\"notify-send\", s, \"At \"+hrs+\":\"+mnts+\" - \"+event[1]])\n\nstartups = []; times = []\n\nwhile True:\n    currtime = convert(time.strftime(\"%H:%M\"))\n    events = [l.strip() for l in get([\"calcurse\", \"-a\"]).splitlines()][1:]\n    # arrange event data:\n    groups = []; sub = []\n    for l in events:\n        if l.startswith(\"* \"):\n            groups.append([l.replace(\"* \", \"\")])\n        elif l.startswith(\"- \"):\n            sub.append(convert(l.split(\"->\")[0].replace(\"-\", \"\").strip()))\n        else:\n            groups.append(sub+[l])\n            sub = []\n    # run notifications\n    for item in groups:\n        # on startup:\n        if not item in startups:\n            # all- day events\n            if len(item) == 1:\n                subprocess.call([\"notify-send\", \"Today - \"+item[0]])\n            # time- specific events\n            elif len(item) == 2:\n                show_time(item, \"Appointment\")\n            startups.append(item)\n        # as a reminder:\n        if all([len(item) == 2, not item in times]):\n            span = calc_diff(currtime, item[0])\n            if span <= warn:\n                show_time(item, \"[Reminder]\")\n                times.append(item)     \n    # clean up events\n    startups = cleanup(startups, groups); times = cleanup(times, groups)\n    time.sleep(30)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as run_ccursereminders.py\n\n*Test- run it with the time you'd like to be warned (before expiration time, in minutes) as an argument.

Your system service management is no longer performed by upstart.

It executes two pretty much entirely different code paths for upstart and for systemd.\nupstart's native service management commands are initctl start, initctl stop, initctl status and so forth.

Never had that before, what causes that then?\n\nA: All credit to @heemayl for the pointers that resulted in this answer. I've accepted that answer, but here's the details of how I fixed it, in case it's useful to others.\nThe issue was caused by a full inode table. As I understand, there are two parts to a filesystem, inodes and space. inodes are related to the number of files, where as space is just how big they are. My system was chock-full of millions of tiny files caused by Ubuntu not removing old kernels. As the system has run for a long time I had over 40 kernels, incl. header files, installed which is too much for a 20Gb system partition's file system to take.\nThis meant dpkg could not complete an installation - it needed more space to complete its work - but unfortunately that meant neither could I create space by using apt to uninstall things!\nThe solution I found was to move all the /usr/src/ files to my other partition, leaving just a symlink to the files on the full fs:\nsudo mv /usr/src /home/usr-src\nsudo ln -s /home/usr-src /usr/src\n\nAfter doing this I was able to let apt complete:\nsudo apt install -f\n\nAnd after that I was able to uninstall all the older kernels that I did not need, freeing up space, and then I could move the src folder back.\n\nA: As shown in the output of df -i, you are running very low on number of free inodes on / and hence the dpkg fails to complete the operation.\nMost of the time, this is caused by numerous small files created somewhere (unintentionally) in the filesystem.\nYou can check the files of size less than 1 KB and start removing them if not needed:\nsudo find / -type f -size -1k -ls\n\nSimilarly you can check with increasing file sizes until you get to the root of the problem.\n", "Q: Display works weird after installing new kernel I've downloaded and installed linux kernel 4.3.2 over 3.19 on Ubuntu 14.04.

The battery indicator is behaving erratically. It goes to critical mode (<10%) immediately after reaching 57%. It charges up pretty quickly (~20 minutes) but discharges quickly as well. The machine (and the battery) are ~3 years old, so it may be a hardware issue. However, I want to rule out any OS related issues before changing the battery. \n\nA: It may be that one or more of the cells in the battery are failing and hence the total capacity is severely reduced.  The battery uevent sys interface should be able to show the design full capacity and you current maximum battery capacity.  For example, I have an old Dell laptop that shows:\n$ cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/uevent \nPOWER_SUPPLY_NAME=BAT0\nPOWER_SUPPLY_STATUS=Unknown\nPOWER_SUPPLY_PRESENT=1\nPOWER_SUPPLY_TECHNOLOGY=Li-ion\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CYCLE_COUNT=0\nPOWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_MIN_DESIGN=11100000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_NOW=12399000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_FULL_DESIGN=4800000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_FULL=2476000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_NOW=2418000\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY=97\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY_LEVEL=Normal\nPOWER_SUPPLY_MODEL_NAME=DELL 00\nPOWER_SUPPLY_MANUFACTURER=\nPOWER_SUPPLY_SERIAL_NUMBER=53355\n\nIn the above example, the CHARGE_FULL_DESIGN is much higher than the actually CHARGE_FULL, showing that the battery has some cell degradation since it cannot be charged to the design full level. \nLithium-Ion laptop batteries can handle about 1000 charge/discharge cycles, so 3 years of usage is probably hitting this threshold.\n", "Q: Why does apt-get marks packages I dont want directly? If I try to install metapackage apt-get install lubuntu-desktop and then see the output of apt-mark showmanual | grep lubuntu I see much more than just lubuntu-desktop: \nlubuntu-artwork\nlubuntu-core\nlubuntu-deskto\n\nSo, apt-get install lubuntu-desktop marks as manually installed not just the package lubuntu-desktop but also it's dependencies or something. But I don't need those packages directly and this behaviour is weird and unexpected. \nIs there any way to configure apt to mark as manually installed just those packages I install by hands, not with their dependencies or something like that?\n\nA: Quick search through apt sources gave me (1). As far as I understand, packages which are in section listed in APT::Never-MarkAuto-Sections, when installed mark their immediate dependencies as manual. So that installing a metapackage which required, for example, browser, then removing the metapackage leaves the browser installed. This seems to be intended behavior. Should be possible to change by clearing the default APT::Never-MarkAuto-Sections value.\n(1) http://sources.debian.net/src/apt/1.1.9/apt-pkg/depcache.cc/?hl=849#L843\n\nA: From Ubuntu:\nPackage Dependencies\n\nPrograms often use some of the same files as each other. Rather than\nputting these files into each package, a separate package can be\ninstalled to provide them for all of the programs that need them. So,\nto install a program which needs one of these files, the package\ncontaining those files must also be installed. When a package depends\non another in this way, it is known as a package dependency. By\nspecifying dependencies, packages can be made smaller and simpler, and\nduplicates of files and programs are mostly removed.\nWhen you install a program, its dependencies must be installed at the\nsame time. Usually, most of the required dependencies will already be\ninstalled, but a few extras may be needed, too. So, when you install a\npackage, don't be surprised if several other packages are installed\ntoo - these are just dependencies which are needed for your chosen\npackage to function properly.\n\nAs per your question,\nlubuntu-desktop depends on the following:\nlubuntu-artwork lubuntu-core lubuntu-desktop ...\n\nThus, the command sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop installs them as well. It's inevitable.\nEDIT: From Ubuntu:\n\napt-mark\n       apt-mark will change whether a package has been marked as being\n       automatically installed.\n       When you request that a package is installed, and as a result other\n       packages are installed to satisfy its dependencies, the dependencies\n       are marked as being automatically installed. Once these automatically\n       installed packages are no longer depended on by any manually installed\n       packages, they will be removed by e.g.  apt-get or aptitude.\n\nshowauto\n       showauto is used to print a list of automatically installed\n       packages with each package on a new line. All automatically\n       installed packages will be listed if no package is given. If\n       packages are given only those which are automatically installed will be shown.\n\nshowmanual\n       showmanual can be used in the same way as showauto except that it\n       will print a list of manually installed packages instead.\n\n\nIt already says in the manpages, that it will also include its dependencies.\n", "Q: Open all grouped windows with Alt-tab I wondered if it is possible to open all grouped windows of one application at once with Ubuntu's (well, Unity's) alt-tab mechanic.

But every time when I try to uninstall this game, I get an error message and it fails. Please help.\n\n\nA: Option 1\nI can't say that this applies to Wine. This is a method of removing software that applies to Windows too (except paths and registry). If the provided uninstaller doesn't work anymore, all you have to do is manually check for:\n\n*\n\n*entries in Program Files folder: ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/. The folder you're interested in has usually the same name as the software you installed or the name of the developing company. Delete it.\n\n*entries in Application Data folder: ~/.wine/drive_c/users/<your_name>/Application Data/. Again, look for folders matching software name or developer company and delete them. You should also check the public application data folder at: ~/.wine/drive_c/users/Public/Application Data/.\n\n*registry entries. Wine stores registry data in three files: ~/.wine/system.reg, ~/.wine/user.reg and ~/.wine/userdef.reg. Open each with a text editor and look for specific keys related to software or developer name and delete those keys.\n\n*some software places files in ~/.wine/ProgramData and/or ~/.wine/Windows. Deleting folders in these places can break your current wineprefix, so you'll end up with Option 2.\n\nOption 2\nBecause that is a Windows application running in Wine, to completely remove it you can delete the current wineprefix\nrm -rf ~/.wine\n\nNote that after this, if you want to use Wine, you'll have to reconfigure it (i.e. install DLLs, runtimes and other software)\n", "Q: How to make a computer running on runlevel 3 ask for password when waking up from suspend in X?

To do it, boot from the Live CD, open a terminal (by hitting Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the following commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt/\n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nexit\n\nNow reboot and your main disk should have a bootloader (GRUB) with the option to boot into Ubuntu.\n", "Q: can't access my Ubuntu server after I changed the SSH port I can no longer access my digitalocean server running Ubuntu: \nI changed the SSH port from 22 to 36734 this way: \nnano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nand I changed the port from 22 to 36734 \nThen I rebooted the server.

I want to extend it to the bottom corners as well. Wondering if it is possible? There is a similar question asked before but it wasn't intended for the default adwaita theme which gnome 3 uses. I found the file /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/gnome-shell.css which contains some radius stuff but I am not good at it. Wondering if someone knows how to round the bottom corners.\n\nA: Here's how you should proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look for border-radius property.\n\n\nCase I: If there is just a single value assigned to it, like border-radius: 18px;, then it means that the borders will be rounded from all the 4 directions (Top, Right, Bottom, Left) equally (18px in this case).\nCase II: Shorthand Property: If there are multiple values, like border-radius: 18px 0px 0px 18px;, then remember the order (Top, Right, Bottom, Left). This means that the 3d value (0px in this case), represents the bottom radius. Set it to a non-zero value!\nNote: It should not be very hard finding border-radius with shorthand notation. For example, my own gnome-shell.css has only 9 occurences where the border-radius shorthand property (2nd case) is used!\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Why am I unable to connect to ftp, or git or mysql server from my ubuntu 14.04 LTS computer?

Right-click this partition, click \"Resize\" and shrink it about 500 MB. This will leave you with half a GB of unallocated space;\n\n*Right-click the new unallocated space and then click new. Create a new partition formatted as ext2!!! in your flash drive (formatting it as ext2 is VERY important);\n\n*Close GParted. Open a new terminal window and run sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt (again, I suppose your flash drive is sdb);\n\n*Run sudo grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt;\n\n*Reboot your computer.

tells you to use LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose before running glxinfo in order to debug the issue! See if that helps you finding out!\ndid you install the catalyst from the amd site and not with a .deb? Generally i suggest you not install any drivers from outside the repositories. \nI can suggest 3 alternatives if LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose doesnt help:\n\n\n*\n\n*uninstall them (i dont really know how) and install the ones from the repository.(Go to Additional Drivers and install them from there) I'm not sure if they are the latest ones, but if not they will probably be updated soon. This is the most recommended solution, since you dont need to upgrade your distro version!\n\n*Need a more recent driver NOW? then i suggest you upgrade to 15.10 and install the catalyst from there (after uninstaling the current driver)\n\n*You dont need to install a catalyst driver, unless you want the latest opengl features and are a heavy gamer. In general the default open-source drivers on 15.10 can play most games and can have better performance in wine (if using gallium nine from  ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers)\n", "Q: Screen Tearing Nvidia GT640m I want to use my Nvidia card on my computer rather than intel hd4000. However it has a outstanding amount of tearing both vertical and horizontal, even there is god damn triangles appearing in video playbacks.

I've cleared the trash and everything, and Nautilus seems to show only 8GB used. However, when I try to shrink the partition in gparted from a live USB, it shows 19GB used, which won't fit on the SSD. It's strange, because the actual files only take up 8GB.

Do I have to file a new report, or do the official people have the ability to move it?

This issue is fixed for me\n  since the release date.\n\nI do not have this issue anymore since a long time. Might be fixed with 14.10.\n\nYou should file a new bug.\nYou could cite the old report. However, since the person who filed that doesn't have this problem any more, and since the post was rather specifically about CtrlAltT, it's not sure you have the same problem, or even that it's related.

You can't destroy anything this way and you'll see what happens.\n\nA: This is \"normal\" if you installed Ubuntu with UEFI with Secure Boot enabled.\none is the normal boot loader, Ubuntu (XXXXX) and the other is the signed one, ubuntu (XXXXX), you can see the diference one begin in Uppercase, the other one in lowercase.\nfor UEFI with secure boot enabled go with ubuntu (XXXXX), the other one never launch because is not signed. you can delete this one with efibootmgr but is no problem if you leave this installed.\nyou can check your boot entries in your system with:\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nand after this, check man efibootmgr, and if you like, delete the boot entry that you are not going to use, the signed one or the normal one.\n", "Q: Simple Zenity script - to select icon? I am trying to make a simple graphical Zenity+Bash script that will list all the icon themes available in /usr/share/icons, then let the user select one and click \"OK\" to replace gtk-icon-theme-name=\"Humanity\" in ~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine to say the theme name they chose instead of Humanity. I am doing this to provide a graphical method of choosing your icon theme under Openbox, since there is no mainstream program for that yet.\nThis is what I have so far:\n#!/bin/bash\nICONS=$(ls -I \"*.*\" /usr/share/icons); SELECTED=$(zenity --list --column=/usr/share/icons \\ $ICONS); echo 'gtk-icon-theme-name=\"$SELECTED\"' >~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine\n\nIt works, except that echo will actually write $SELECTED in the text file, instead of taking the argument and replacing it with the user's choice.\nThank you in advance to anyone who can help me learn to do this and Zenity basics.\n\nA: This is simple. If you want echo to print the value of $SELECT, you should not use single quotes ', do double quotes \" instead. Followings are the meanings of quoting and backslash.\n\n\n*\n\n*The double quote ( \"quote\" ) protects everything enclosed between two\ndouble quote marks except $, ', \" and \\.Use the double quotes when\nyou want only variables and command substitution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Variable - Yes\n\n*Wildcards - No\n\n*Command substitution - yes\n\n\n*The single quote ( 'quote' ) protects everything enclosed between two\nsingle quote marks. It is used to turn off the special meaning of all\ncharacters.\n\n\n*\n\n*Variable - No\n\n*Wildcards - No\n\n*Command substitution - No\n\n\n*Use backslash ('\\') to change the special meaning of the characters or to\nescape special characters within the text such as quotation marks.\nThus your command should be:\n#!/bin/bash\nICONS=$(ls -I \"*.*\" /usr/share/icons); SELECTED=$(zenity --list --column=/usr/share/icons \\ $ICONS); echo \"gtk-icon-theme-name=\\\"$SELECTED\\\"\" >~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine\n\n\nA: In addition to @TungTran's answer, your script begs for some improvements.\nCramming the script on a single line makes it hard to read/understand/debug. Write one command per line:\n#!/bin/bash\nICONS=$(ls -I \"*.*\" /usr/share/icons)\nSELECTED=$(zenity --list --column=/usr/share/icons \\ $ICONS)\necho \"gtk-icon-theme-name=\\\"$SELECTED\\\"\" >~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine\n\nAnother sometimes less troublesome way to embed a variable in text output is using printf:\nprintf 'gtk-icon-theme-name=\"%s\"\\n' \"$SELECTED\" >~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine\n\n", "Q: usb modem not detected I am using Ubuntu 14.04.

I've been using the VM for about a year and it has generally been meeting my needs thus far (despite being extremely slow and buggy); however, I am about to start developing software for computer graphics (i.e. involving software Virtual Reality, WebGL/OpenGL, Unity). Currently I'm unable to even run WebGL programs in any browser (including Chromium) in my Ubuntu 14.04 VM even after having installed Ubuntu Restricted Extras. In addition to this, more immediately, I'm going to need to install a node.js server for some graphics work that I'll be doing soon, which I would think would be better in a Unix like OS; however, the graphics won't be able to run on what I have currently.\nI was considering just dual booting Ubuntu as I've seen that WebGL can run on the dual booted version; however, I have some concerns about doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I like the workflow of being able to jump back and forth between Windows and Linux which is something that dual booting doesn't allow.\n\n*I've seen that virtualization and dual booting are possible at the same time, but I'm not sure of the viability of this nor the associated risks.\n\n*I could only use apps like Unity or Visual Studio through Wine, which wouldn't be ideal\n\n\nThere are some other concerns, but generally, given what my needs are going to be at this point, should I switch to dual booting or is there away to run this software properly in a VM, or is there a way to do both?\n\nA: Well, if you want to develop apps on *nix, you should switch to it. There are similar programs for almost everything you had on Windows, even for Visual Studio (for Mono/.NET I'd suggest MonoDevelop). Unity has native support for Ubuntu, IIRC.\nThe truth is, you can't sit on 2 seats. Dual-boot helps to ease your transfer to the new world and it's the next logical step after virtualization. It is intended for constructing the new workflow, smoothly moving all your stuff to it and finally cut off the old roots. This can be done because Ubuntu supports NTFS (Windows filesystem) while Windows doesn't support Ext4 (Linux basic FS).\nAfter transfer, for most Windows-specific tasks you can virtualize Windows inside your *nix system just like you did before. This means that host will be Ubuntu (if you choose it; there are plenty of another choices) and guest will be Windows. There even exists VMWare, which virtualization level is slightly better than in VirtualBox.\nSo, back up and go forward. We have dozens of ton interesting things here.\nSo, if you want to copy all your files to the new system, there are 2 ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move everything you need to shared folder, install Ubuntu, boot there and access files from there.\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple\n\n*Easy\n\n*Safe\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can loose some important files which are not in home directory\n\n*You will have to tune up everything again\n\n*It takes longer time\n\n\n*And you can copy entire image to physical drive, install GRUB then just boot. Pros and Cons will be mirrored. Consult Migrate from a virtual machine (VM) to a physical system article for tips.\n", "Q: Copy paste key bindings not working in Tilda Terminal? In the Gnome terminal or in the terminator, I use Ctrl+Shift+C for copying and Ctrl+Shift+V for pasting, but these key bindings are not working in Tilda.

I've never encrypted my data and I am thinking about it, but I am not sure which is the best option, I know there are tools like TrueCrypt, that the developers don't recommend now or GnuPG, but i think that if I am going to encrypt at least I should use the most secure option. \n\nA: For encryption you have a few decent options:\nVeraCrypt\nVeraCrypt is a fork of TrueCrypt. It has fixed all the known flaws of TrueCrypt and is actively developed. It is used just like TrueCrypt and is compatible with old TrueCrypt containers.\nPros:\n\n*\n\n*It is flexible, it can encrypt container files or disk devices with no added complexity.\n\n*It has a nice GUI and powerful algorithms to keep your data safe.\n\n*It's available for Windows, Linux and Mac -- cross compatibility.\n\nCons:\n\n*\n\n*It's not available in the repositories.\n\n*No automatic updates.\n\nLUKS\nLUKS works in much the same way as VeraCrypt. It's able to encrypt disk devices (whole disks or partitions) and files. It is also compatible with Ubuntu out-of-the-box.\nTo format a partition as LUKS, use a command like this:\nsudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX #See man cryptsetup for other options such as algorithm and key strength\n\nThen, when this device is plugged in, you should get a password prompt to unlock the device. If this doesn't happen, you must use a command like sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX encrypteddrive\nPros:\n\n*\n\n*Built-in Ubuntu kernel support\n\n*Good degree of configurability.\n\nCons:\n\n*\n\n*No GUI, the drive must be formatted from the command line.\n\n*Not mountable in Windows and possibly Mac.\n\neCryptFS\nThis is a built-in home folder encryption that can be enabled in Ubuntu. However, in Ubuntu it only uses a 128-bit RSA key which seems fairly weak. It also offers filename encryption which also encrypts filenames in the home folder until it is decrypted.\nPros:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu support is out-of-the-box\n\nCons:\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't already enabled it, it's a quite a chore to get your home folder encrypted after-the-fact.\n\n*The 128-bit encryption default is fairly weak.\n\n*Also, not cross-platform.\n\nGnuPG\nAs you mentioned, GnuPG is another option. Though, it doesn't really fall into the same category as the others on this list. It's really only suitable for encrypting single files and there is no transparent way to access the contents without decrypting the whole file, making changes, and then re-encrypting it. This, of course, leaves an unencrypted copy of the file on the disk.\nIf you're only looking to encrypt a few files rather than a partition, then this is a viable option. Anything more than that, however, and GnuPG is lacking.\nPros:\n\n*\n\n*Fairly simple to use, after installing seahorse-nautilus  it's a simple right-click->Encrypt... process.\n\n*Up to 4096-bit encryption is available\n\n*Available for Windows, Mac and Linux -- cross compatibility.\n\nCons:\n\n*\n\n*Can only be used for individual files\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, \"best\" is a matter of opinion and your desired use case.\nIf you're looking for single file encryption, I'd say that GnuPG is your best option as it's up to you which files you want to encrypt.\nIf you're looking for partition, drive, device, or container encryption, I'd say VeraCrypt is probably the best overall option. It has a nice, easy-to-use GUI as well as some powerful features and multiple layers of encryption. However, it wouldn't be suitable for encrypting something like your home folder, since you'd have to unlock the /home partition with VeraCrypt before you were even able to log in.\nFor more-or-less whole OS encryption though, LUKS would probably be the best tool to accomplish the task. However, some setup is required to get this working as expected and would be considered an advanced or expert level process.\nI'm sure there are more options, but these are my mainstays and a few to get you started =)\n", "Q: How do i install ubuntu on a Chromebook I'm wondering how to install Ubuntu on my Chromebook? And what other steps should be taken?\nMatt\n\nA: Short Answer: You can't (In most cases). Especially if your Chromebook is a school or company issued Chromebook. \nLong Answer: If your Chromebook that you wish is NOT part of a Corporate/Education system then you can look into these options: \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nChrUbuntu: ChrUbuntu is a Ubuntu system built for Chromebooks. It works like a traditional dual-boot system. You can restart your Chromebook and choose between Chrome OS and Ubuntu at boot time. ChrUbuntu can be installed on your Chromebook’s internal storage or on a USB device or SD card.\nCrouton: Crouton actually uses a “chroot” environment to run both Chrome OS and Ubuntu at the same time. Ubuntu runs alongside Chrome OS, so you can switch between Chrome OS and your standard Linux desktop environment with a keyboard shortcut. This gives you the ability to take advantage of both environments without any rebooting needed. Crouton allows you to use Chrome OS while having a standard Linux environment with all its command-line tools and desktop applications a few keystrokes away.\nThere are plenty of \"How-To's\" out there right now but I suggest you look here. \nNOTE: A further explanation about why you CANNOT install ANY type of 3rd party Linux software on a Chrombook of workplace or school facility:\nI know this from first hand experience and hours of attempting and failing. All Chromebooks that are purchased by a company or an organization is given a Control Panel that gives the IT Staff the ability to block/disable specific functions of the Chromebook. BY DEFAULT the Control Panel is set to block your access to the part of the developer console required to install Linux. \nThere is a way around this, but it requires you to remove the bottom of your Chromebook. You then flip a switch that can be located on different locations on your Chromebook depending on the Model/Version. That switch will then essentially \"hard reset\" your Chromebook. Doing this however will void ANY warranty. Not to mention if you are not familiar with Linux, the risk of \"Bricking\" your Chromebook becomes dangerously high. \n", "Q: how to backup before update so I just installed ubuntu 15.10 on my Macbook 6,2 core i5 and it is running flawlessly. Now before I got it to where it is now, I had a previous install which didn't work that great. In the previous install I installed the proprietary Nvidia drivers alongside with a bunch of updates and upon reboot, I was stuck at the login screen. I tried uninstalling the Nvidia driver and going back to noveau but didn't work that great either. \nSo I ended up doing a clean installation again and this time I installed the Nvidia drivers first and it worked, Now I have some pending updates to make but I'm afraid that it might break my system. I spend the whole day configuring the system to my liking and I would hate to do it all over again.\nIs there a way I can backup my settings, ala \"Windows System Restore\" style, update and if anything goes wrong, I can just go back to where I was?\n\nA: Yes, you have an option to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot an Ubuntu Live DVD.\n\n*Select Try Ubuntu.\n\n*Now, when you are in live environment, open GParted and look for the partitions you are trying to backup, i.e., /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2\n\n*Next, open three terminals:\na. In one of them write this command, do not press Enter now. Keep it open after typing the command:\nsudo ps aux | grep dd | awk '/root/ {print $2\" \"$11}'\n\nThis command will give you the PID of the dd process used later on.\nAfter you run this command at a later time, you will get a name that would say only dd and a number infront of that, you have to take note of that number then.\nb. In the second terminal write this command, do not press Enter now. Keep it open after typing the command:\nwatch -n 1 kill -USR1 THE NUMBER FROM STEP 4.a\n\nThis command will show you the progress of the dd process in the third terminal.\nc. In the third terminal, type the following, and run it:\nAfter running this command, immediatly run the command from 4.a first and then the command from 4.b.\nsudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdXY of=/path/to/your/backup-directory/anyfilename.iso\n\nHere, /dev/sdXY is the partition you want to backup.\nThis command will actually execute the dd command.\nNow, keep tab on the terminal from 4.c and wait for the command to finish.\nBackup completes on the completion of the command. Now, you can do whatever you want. Cheers!\n", "Q: How to configure existing raid after upgrading to 14.04 from 11 I have a pci raid controller, with two 250G drives.

I'm guessing it was raid0 or some other software configuration of the 2 disks.  \nHow can I get this existing pair of raid disks working again without erasing any of the data?  \n\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 164.7 GB, 164696555520 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 20023 cylinders, total 321672960 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00045ec8\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   315906047   157952000   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       315908094   321671167     2881537    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       315908096   321671167     2881536   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625142448 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0005a448\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1           16065   625137344   312560640   83  Linux\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 251.0 GB, 251000193024 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30515 cylinders, total 490234752 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00003bda\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1           16065   980463014   490223475   83  Linux\n\nDisk /dev/sdd: 251.0 GB, 251000193024 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30515 cylinders, total 490234752 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/sdd doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\n\nA: Stumbled on dmraid.

Time for them to index my whole harddisk is 0.2 seconds[i guess they use the NTFS journal database]. They are automatically re-index instantly if some new files are created.\nI want to locate a file in Linux by just its filename NOT its content. everything does the same in windows.\nIn Linux i have found two options that works for me. Time for them to index my whole harddisk using:\n\n\n*\n\n*1st option: sudo updatedb (mlocate) 3 minutes to reindex the database.\n\n*2nd option: everything via wine ... roughly 5 minutes [it index even ext4 ].\n\n\nNow I am a desktop user so i prefer a nice gui to search them quickly.\n\n\n*\n\n*1st option : use the same everything via wine. Searching file is instant. Problem then arise with mime settings which can be fixed via https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MestreLion/wine-tools/master/wine-import-extensions\n\n*2nd option: catfish uses the power of locate. It does job but displaying file takes around 2 seconds even though all files have been indexed by updatedb.\n\n\n\nHonourable mentions: \n\n\n*\n\n*krunner does the job.. but i hate the fact that baloo indexing takes forever. I guess it search for content inside file as well. If only it would give us to index just the filename.\n\n*unity dash can find the files you touched. But it doesnot locate outside the files/folder which you have touched. \n\n\nSo my question . Does anybody knows how i can index quickly and search the indexed filename with a gui?\n\nA: My first recommendation is ANGRYsearch. Superfast, fully configurable. You can find the official website here. To install, you need some dependencies (if not there already). In a terminal type:\nsudo apt install python3-pyqt5\n\nThen, download latest release from here. Unzip in a folder, and then from a terminal inside that folder type:\nchmod +x install.sh\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nA second recommentation is regexxer. This is easier to install. From a terminal, just type: sudo apt-get install regexxer. Yet, I have not used this so I cannot tell how fast it is.\n\nA: I also recommend FSearch https://github.com/cboxdoerfer/fsearch\nI found that it index my files faster than ANGRYsearch. However searching for files feels smooth with ANGRYsearch. Recrawling is faster with ANGRYsearch. So overall ANGRYsearch feels better.\nFSearch is just in PreAlpha according to git page. So future release may improve it.\nCompiling was little trouble for me. So I am posting following here for my own future reference and it might help others as well.\nI tried the following in Kubuntu 16.04\nsudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev autotools-dev automake libglib2.0-dev intltool gnome-common git\ngit clone https://github.com/cboxdoerfer/fsearch\ncd fsearch\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\nA: I am going for the desktop search feature of the kde plasma. I guess the following is possible ... \nbalooctl config set contentIndexing no\n\n\nA: This is the BEST,\nFSearch is a promising new file search utility for the Linux desktop, inspired by the Everything Search Engine tool for Windows.\nread this OMGUbuntu article about it\ndownload a (64-bit) .deb package from here on GitHub\nInstall with Gdebi or \ncd Downloads                   # or wherever your downloads go \nsudo dpkg -i fsearch*.deb      # replace with exact name if needed\n\n\nA: I would use gnome-do myself. It occasionally froze for me the first time I would use it upon rebooting, but this can be mostly solved by changing its settings to get rid of the shadow and transparency effects. What's more you can change the appearance style (I prefer mini myself) and the colour of the widow to suit your preferences. Also it can if desired auto-start with your computer. To install type:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-do\n\nHope it works for you!\n\nA: another BEST is albert. It is best keyboard launcher out there in linux community. And it has files extension that monitors your filesystem very quick and periodically.\n\n\nA: Why do you need Wine?\nIs it not what you search (on Linux system)? \n\n\n*\n\n*apropos - search the manual page names and descriptions\nman apropos\n\n\n*locate - find files by name\nman locate\nlocate \"fir.\"\n\n\n*find - search for files in a directory hierarchy\nman find \nfind / |grep \"fir.\"\n\n\n*grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines matching a pattern\ngrep -R \"fir.\" /home/yourdir/*\n\n\n*Try to look into thisLink (maybe searchmonkey??) for more options.\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade Ubuntu from 14.04 to the latest release When I try to upgrade, I get the following error:\nsudo aptitude upgrade\nResolving dependencies...                \nopen: 217520; closed: 114638; defer: 5; conflict: 6                            O\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'\n  what():  std::bad_alloc\n\nIf I try using Software Updater, first I get a dialog that says \nnot all updates can be installed\nRun a partial upgrade ...

As a task of my assignment, I used wireshark to capture packets. Now in Client Hello message, I saw compression method:null(0). Now I am confused what is that mean?

Or null(0) is itself a compression technique?\n\n\nA: See section 6.2.2 and section 7.4.1.2 of RFC 5246.\n\nA: Compression method: null (0) means that the data received from the record layer will not be compressed, nowadays SSL is not doing the compression for the data received from the upper layer because HTTP is doing the job for it at layer 7.\nSo usually, you will find this to be set as null.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 15.10 on an old version (8.04) I'm currently running on Ubuntu 8.04 but the original was 15.04.

However, it uses some weird programming to redirect short URLs like http://manpages.ubuntu.com/ls.1 to http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/en/man1/ls.1posix.html, and it always picks the latest release. Otherwise, it works fine when using lynx with the full URL. It even looks like a normal manpage:\n\nThe redirection doesn't work in lynx (or elinks or w3m). Just to check, I tried on my Arch Linux elinks, which apparently does support JavaScript:\n$ elinks -version\nELinks 0.13.GIT a3751107033599b835eaafa61177c8d4dda4b7ef-dirty\nBuilt on Oct 31 2013 20:43:18\n\nFeatures:\nStandard, IPv6, gzip, bzip2, UTF-8, Periodic Saving, Viewer (Search\nHistory, Timer, Marks), Cascading Style Sheets, Protocol\n(Authentication, File, CGI, FTP, HTTP, URI rewrite, User protocols),\nSSL (OpenSSL), MIME (Option system, Mailcap, Mimetypes files), LED\nindicators, Bookmarks, Cookies, ECMAScript (SpiderMonkey), Form\nHistory, Global History, Scripting (Lua, Spidermonkey ECMAScript), Goto\nURL History\n\nedbrowse didn't redirect either.

Is there a program which can bring up the online manpage, preferably for the running Ubuntu version? In case of matches in multiple sections, it should behave like man does.\n\nA: You can just give lynx the search url with the man page you want. In the search results use the lynx l command to list the returned links and choose the one you want.

Then I decided to install Ubuntu 12.10 64bit in space of Linux Mint. I successfully installed it by using the Mint Partitions.\nFirst Problem : Laptop didn't show GRUB menu and instead directly loaded Ubuntu without showing an option for Windows.\nTried Solution : I solved this problem earlier too using boot-repair from the ubuntu live usb but this time it showed some errors. Then I ran some command on terminal after looking for the solution online which formatted my whole 500GB hard disk.\nI then used my ubuntu live usb to boot and created a partition table using GParted.

I want to monitor the rm, mv and mkdir commands in Ubuntu Server. \nHow could this be achieved? \n\nA: If you want to log the usage of these commands, you could make some shell scripts to wrap them.\nFor example, for rm:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho $(date +\"%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S\") $USER: $0 $@ >> /tmp/rm.log\n/bin/rm.real $@\n\nAssuming you named this file rm_log.sh, you install it like this:\n$ sudo mv -n /bin/rm /bin/rm.real\n$ sudo cp rm_log.sh /bin/rm\n\nNow whenever someone uses the rm command, you get a new line in the /tmp/rm.log file.

If your PC is still playing from NAS, you should be able to log in using ssh (if server is installed). This way you can kill vlc.\n2.) Add a cron job to kill vlc in the morning. This will also show you if the vlc is the reason for the freezing screen or if some thing else is going on.\n", "Q: Ubuntu gone after installing windows 8 I had two OS on my PC Windows 7 and Ubuntu in separated partitions. After trying to change windows 7 to windows 8, it works good but Ubuntu has disappeared and the weird thing is that, its partition appeared on my hard drive but I can't switch between them. How can I get Ubuntu back?\n\nA: You should install grub again (because windows rewrites you MBR). To do this boot from your ubuntu cd/usb and  type in terminal:\nsudo mount /dev/sda4 /mnt && sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\nIn this case sda4 is the linux partition. \nThen reboot and grub menu should be there and you will see Ubuntu too.\n\nA: Just in case.\nBoot from your installation media (DVD/USB). Select the 'Try Ubuntu' option, this should run Ubuntu from the DVD/USB then you can open a terminal window & enter the command that Nikolay mentions.\nThumbs up Nikolay, was looking for this myself the other day :D\n", "Q: Does Wily have inherently better WiFi performance than Trusty? I started with 15.04 on a Lenovo G70-80 and after a few days upgraded to 15.10. WiFi performance on 15.10 was noticeably better than it had been on 15.04. Then I downgraded to (installed afresh) 14.04 from 15.10 and noticed significant WiFi speed drop. To see if WiFi performance is really contingent on OS versions, I again upgraded to 15.04 and then to 15.10. I noticed speed increases as I upgrade.\nIs it a fact regarding OS versions (and kernel coming with OS's)? Or is it my hardware? And I have a weak-to-fair WiFi signal because of router's distance from machine.\nI had 64-bit GNOME flavor in all cases.\n\nA: The OS will not influence radio signal strength. But the firmware of the WiFi HW and its setup may do. With every Ubuntu you get firmware files (located in /lib/firmware). Depending on your WiFi HW one of these files may be loaded at startup. If you experience such an obvious difference, you should check the difference of the firmware file in question.\nIt may also depend on some configuration settings, especially the country setting is influencing the transmission power. Have a look at\niwconfig\n\nand the Tx-Power value. Some WiFi HW has two or more antennas which can be configurated. But for these deeper details the type of HW needs to be known.\nLast point is self made interference. For example the beaglebone black is known to interfere WiFi with its own HDMI output. So this shall be disabled for better WiFi results. Every PC may have components interfering its own WiFi. So WiFi performance depends on the operation state of these.\nBut NO Wily does not overall have a better WiFi performance than Trusty.\n", "Q: Changes in grub configuration file not allowingg to login in ubuntu 14.04 I have changed the following entry in grub configuration file as follows:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\" \n\nAfter this change I am unable to login in ubuntu 14.04. Whenever I am login it is coming to same login window.\nplease suggest me what should I do now. I have tried to loging through window that comes after pressing ctrl+alt+f1 but not able to login through that as well.\n\nA: Boot your computer. When the GRUB menu (the one that lets you select your OS) shows up, select Ubuntu and press 'e'. If this menu does not appear, keep pressing Shift right after the computer boots until it does.\nAfter pressing 'e' on Ubuntu you will see some kind of text editor. Find the line that begins with linux and go to its end. Remove nomodeset from the end of the line and press F10. Ubuntu should boot.\nOpen a terminal window and run the following commands:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nChange the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\".\nSave the file and exit.

Did blkid -U of each and non is /dev/sda8 which the swap is supposed to be. I got sda's 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, and /dev/mapper/luks-****. The last of which I think is the other encrypted partition that I left untouched during installation (was encrypted by 12.04).\nI also tried the following answer. Did not work either.\nUpdate:\nI ended up reformatting the partitions and re-installing the system. It seems working fine now.\n\nA: cryptswap1 (skipped, device /dev/disk/by-uuid/df55bf68-b824-4f21-83f3-dfa80a0b74ab does not exist)\n\nWhatever volume had UUID=df55bf68-b824-4f21-83f3-dfa80a0b74ab, when that /etc/crypttab entry was generated, doesn't exist any longer.\nHow to fix it\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo swapoff -a just to make sure that all swap spaces are released. The output of swapon -s should now be empty (apart from a column header line).\n\n*Remove (or comment out) the lines about swap in /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab. Make back-ups, if you're unsure.\n\n*You say you want to place swap on /dev/sda8. Ignore it's current content for the remainder of these instructions; treat is a garbage data. You will lose all data on sda8 in the process! Make a backup, if you value it!\n\n*Set up a new swap space on /dev/sda8, either unencrypted or encrypted.\nMy previous advice (please use the above one instead)\nSince raw devices (or raw dm-crypt devices) don't have UUIDs, you'll need to resort to other device identifiers. Kernel names (/dev/sd* and friends) aren't stable across boots, so your best bet is to find the entry inside /dev/disk/by-id/, that links to your intended encrypted swap partition. Those are stable enough in my experience (barring changes in the kernel or udev scripts).\nAssuming that /dev/sda8 is the intended place for the encrypted swap partition, you can find it's ID-based path(s) in the output of\nls -l /dev/disk/by-id/* | grep sda8\n\nor more elaborately with:\nfind -L /dev/disk/by-id -samefile /dev/sda8\n\nYou can use one of the results for the second column of the crypttab entry.\n\nA: I think you have an error in your /etc/fstab file. You swap does not have mount point.\nChange the line\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nto\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 swap swap defaults 0 0\n\n", "Q: Wireless doesn't work on Lenovo z50 (with Qualcomm Atheros) on Ubuntu 15.10 I just installed Ubuntu 15.10 on a Lenovo Z50 laptop and the wireless does not work. \n\n$ sudo lshw -C network\n\nGave me *-network UNCLAIMED at first.

How can I solve this problem and watch my DVD?\n\nA: The mentioned package gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad is a package containing codecs needed to decode and play DVD video content. Here is its description:\n\nDescription-en: GStreamer plugins from the \"bad\" set\n\n\nGStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters\nwhich operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do\nanything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just\nabout anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means\nthat new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by\ninstalling new plug-ins.\n\n\nGStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared\nto the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing\nsomething - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a\nreal live maintainer, or some actual wide use.\n\nIt is not installed by default in Ubuntu, because it contains proprietary or non-freely licensed codecs. You may still use them legally, but the Ubuntu developers preferred to only ship open-source software with the default installation.\nThe following command typed in a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) should solve the problem:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nAlternatively, click the red button below which will take you to a site that helps you installing the package through your Software Center.\nHowever, I strongly recommend using the terminal, because the other method might lead to problems because the Software Center fails to display you the License Agreement.\n\n\nIf you want, you can probably also just install the requested gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad  codec package only (not tested by me, I can't guarantee that this will work):\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad\n\n", "Q: I can't install google product (google adwords editor ) via Wine I updated Ubuntu to 15.10 and I can't install Google adwords editor (11.2.1) .

If this link also stops working, you can contact Google Ads support directly and ask for them to send the most recent version file to you.\n\nI've found you can get AdWords Editor to install if you work from the .msi file rather than the EditorSetup.exe file. The instructions here generally work; you might have to fiddle with your Wine settings a bit and make sure you get the right .msi version.\nRemember that Google uses 4 digits in the version number for the .msi download.

First, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nIf these changes do not help, please try:\nsudo modprobe -r rt2800pci\nsudo modprobe rt2800pci nohwcrypt=Y\n\nIf it helps, make it permanent:\nsudo -i\necho \"options rt2800pci nohwcrypt=Y\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/rt2800pci.conf\nexit\n\nFinally, Network Manager will default to ethernet if it's available. Please make your tests with the ethernet detached.\n", "Q: Open a file with gedit over ssh I am trying to display a file with gedit, from my home, when connected to ssh in a machine of my uni.

I'm using an external Audient iD14 audio interface with a Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04 dual boot system. I mainly use Windows for FL Studio and the Adobe Creative Suite, but I like to mess around with Ubuntu from time to time, especially for programming.\nEverything works great except that for some reason, Ubuntu lists my audio interface as Analogue Surround 4.0 when it actually only plays in stereo. As a result, the audio plays louder in the right channel than the left channel. While I can get it to work by adjusting the balance with the slider, it still sounds a little off. It's not bad, but it just doesn't sound as good as it does on Windows.\nSo is there any way to force Ubuntu to treat sound devices as stereo? I know the problem might be that there are no Audient device drivers for Linux, but I wanted to make sure before I just accept to live with slightly poorer audio quality.\n\nA: I found solution in Linux Mint and Lubuntu, maybe it will work in another Linux...\n\n*\n\n*In software manager, type alsa and install qashctl,\n\n*then in menu Sound and video find and open qashctl,\n\n*and on the right side, Mixer device, under hw: select Audient iD14\n\n*and on the left side under \"Mixer\" open Speaker playback volume and turn up volume to the top -127db and both channel work same and sound is very good.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu (Linux in general) is correct in assigning 4 outputs as there are 4 outputs on the iD14.\nAs you and I both know, only one pair of outputs are physically accessible. Outputs 3&4 are primarily used to send alternate mixes to musicians and are only accessible via the Audient mixer and/or DAW. The iD14 is class compliant in as far as it is recognized and some audio can be heard. Unfortunately that is as far as it goes (currently) as there is no mixer available to ALSA or Pulse e.t.c.\nIf you open a terminal and run alsamixer, press F6 and select Audient iD14, it will report a broken pipe error. ALSA (or Pulseaudio) has no way of knowing how to allocate the outputs, so assumes all 4 detected outs are available, but also has no way of directing signal appropriately. It \"MAY\" be possible to create a new sink and assign it as stereo, but you may still get an imbalance in left and right, or worse, have left and right output on one channel only. Also, all the digital inputs and Scroll Control functions will not work.\n\nA: a little late, but I found a workaround. You can't make Ubuntu recognize it as a stereo device. What you can do is configure your pulse daemon to play stereo sources only in stereo, instead of \"remixing\" them into surround.\nPut this in your /etc/pulse/daemon.conf:\nenable-remixing = no\n\nAfter that, simply run a:\npulseaudio --kill\n\nYour pulse daemon will restart, and hopefully you hear smooth stereo sounds.\n\nA: If anyone still reads this. I just tried it with my iD14 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and out of the box I had the sound only on one ear.\nFirst of all, setting the output configuration to Analog Surround 5.0 Output at least got the sound to both ears (but not on equal volume).\nAnd I got to equal volume by just raising the System Volume slider to max.\nFor some reason, Ubuntu only controls the volume of the right ear and not the left so if the system volume is all the way up there is no difference and you can control your desired volume on the iD14.\n", "Q: unable to locate mingw32 I'm trying to compile from source everything I need in order to build Ubuntu touch for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.

My hardware is a Dell XPS running XP. It would be OK to lose everything on the 10.04 but I am not sure how to go about reformatting the Ubuntu partition. Can anyone help this newbie?\nThanks,\nSick Berry\n\nA: Warning before you proceed:\n\nIn any case when upgrading an OS perform a backup of any valuable data on an external storage medium just in the unlikely but not impossible case something goes wrong.\n\nRegular upgrades will only work without issues through still supported releases, i.e. from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS. A release that reached end of life like 10.04 can be upgraded but it may not give us desired results. A much faster, easier, and more reliable way would be to just perform a fresh install of the new release over the old release.\nThis is possible with keeping our HOME, leaving our personal data untouched, and it may even try to preserve application settings whenever possible. We then only may have to re-install our additionally installed applications, and we will also have to restore the user accounts (which shoulf be easy if we had chosen identical user names)\nTo do so we will be presented a screen similar to below on installing from a CD or USB with a more recent version (shown here for \"upgrading\" 15.04 to 16.04 by skipping release 15.10, which is similar to \"upgrading\" 10.04 to 14.04 or 15.10):\n\nOn choosing the \"Upgrade\" option your drive will not be formatted, data in the HOME directory will not be deleted, and the dual boot option will be preserved.\nAdvanced users can also fine-tune the partition layout by choosing \"something else\" but this bears a much higher risk to accidentally remove partitions or files we wanted to keep.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu comes with two firewalls by default? I realised Ubuntu comes with two firewalls by default iptables and ufw. But why? I mean running more than one software firewall on one computer can be bad because it can cause conflicts. I don't understand why it has two by default - won't that be bad?\n\nA: It doesn't come with two firewalls. From the Ubuntu wiki page on ufw (sic):\n\nThe Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables and is\n  particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls. ufw provides a\n  framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface\n  for manipulating the firewall. ufw aims to provide an easy to use\n  interface for people unfamiliar with firewall concepts, while at the\n  same time simplifies complicated iptables commands to help an\n  adminstrator who knows what he or she is doing. ufw is an upstream for\n  other distributions and graphical frontends.\n\nOne is a frontend to the other. There is only one firewall.\n\nA: Both ufw, gufw, and a number of alternate \"frontends\" all create configuration for iptables. They aren't firewalls, they are config editors for the firewall.\nThey work only \"work\" when you open them and edit the options. After you \"save\" the config IPTables just applies the changes and starts working using the new config, but it really doesn't matter what you use to load or edit the config. Various config editors may \"conflict\" in that if you created a setup in one, another may fail to load it properly and you will be editing it \"from scratch/from default\" and not from \"currently active\", and applying it will override the current one instead of merging with it. But otherwise, IPTables doesn't care what creates its config, and config editors don't care what other config editors are next to them. \n", "Q: Bug in system information script 'inxi' - displaying folder content instead of info I just ran inxi -m (version 2.2.16-0ubuntu1 on Ubuntu 15.10 64-bit), which should...\n-M   Show machine data.

It always occurs when there is a * character anywhere in the fetched system information.\nIf this bug affects you too and your Ubuntu repository package version is still below 2.2.32-00 (compiled before 2016-01-03), you can download the executable script from smxi's server and replace your current version with it using the following command:\nsudo wget -O /usr/bin/inxi smxi.org/inxi\n\nThis will replace the executable of your currently installed (e.g. through apt-get) inxi version with the latest version.\nIf you had the version from the official Ubuntu repository installed before, this command will not mess up anything.

What is being set in the settings goes into gsettings ( which is a framework for storring app settings, that's slightly different ) and then relays whatever shortcuts you set to gnome-settings-daemon or unity-settings-daemon.  That means we have to alter Compiz settings first.\nThe steps I personally took were as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager with sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n*Open compizconfig-settings-manager with ccsm command form terminal or from dash's search\n\n*Under Ubuntu Unity Plugin option find Key to lock screen option, click on the button describing the shortcut. \nYou will see the a small popup window. Unckeck the enabled option.\n\nAt this point you can go to Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts and set custom shortcuts with keybinding Super + L as dm-tool lock command.\nTested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Trusty\nEdit\nSince OP is using Ubuntu Gnome and not Unity, I used my 15.10 Ubuntu Gnome virtual machine, and found that in a normal session there's no compiz processes running , however the Super+L appears to be hard codded within the gnome-shell itself. \nWhat I've successfully achieved is the following : run  the gsettings command bellow and in the Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom  menu set custom shortcut CtrlAltL to dm-tool lock command. \n  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen true\n\nAfter  running the command and creating shortcut, instead of the usual builtin gnome lock screen , I was able to use lightdm.  OP also confirmed this in our conversation in the chat , but wanted Super + L to be the actual accelerator, and with better speed of locking. At the moment I am unable to address these issues, and it seems the key combination OP wants is hard-coded, hence unchangeable, but i am not 100% certain . \n", "Q: Files in fstab mounted CIFS folders are not available automatically I'm using Ubuntu 15.10, and I've mounted some NAS folders using /etc/fstab.

Is it possible to create, through the use of debconf, a package that validates the minimum system requirements to run the software? Is debconf pre-install config script the way to do it?\nThanks\n\nA: You can display warnings during package installation. However, aborting the installation is a bad idea - you will leave the package system in a broken state and until the user removes your package, every package installation will end with an attempt to finish installing yours. That will be terrible user experience.\nYou can use a postinst script to do this - I suggest postinst since you might have to install packages as dependencies to detect the hardware, etc., and packaging policy specifies that prompting be done in postinst:\n\nIf a package has a vitally important piece of information to pass to\n  the user (such as \"don't run me as I am, you must edit the following\n  configuration files first or you risk your system emitting\n  badly-formatted messages\"), it should display this in the config or\n  postinst script and prompt the user to hit return to acknowledge the\n  message. Copyright messages do not count as vitally important (they\n  belong in /usr/share/doc/package/copyright); neither do instructions\n  on how to use a program (these should be in on-line documentation,\n  where all the users can see them).\nAny necessary prompting should almost always be confined to the config\n  or postinst script. If it is done in the postinst, it should be\n  protected with a conditional so that unnecessary prompting doesn't\n  happen if a package's installation fails and the postinst is called\n  with abort-upgrade, abort-remove or abort-deconfigure.\n\nWith debconf, a db_input command with priority high or critical could display the warning.\nIt might be better to write a wrapper script for your software executable which checks the requirements, and shows a more visible message, with possibly an option to uninstall your package.\n", "Q: Intel vaapi : can't play mkv with vlc I can find why I can't play any mkv file with vlc, it seems there is a drawing error, is there a workaround or something ?

On my Ubuntu computer I have Iptables,ufw and gufw installed on it but I am trying to figure out if I need to remove one so I did a experiment and removed iptables and I saw ufw and gufw was removed automatically with iptables I reintall iptables and it did not  automatically came with ufw or gufw I install gufw without installing ufw and ufw was install automatically with gufw It like there are all connected to function properly but that just a experiment I went a true answer?\n\nA: The answer before mine is right. But let's see if we can make it sound simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*iptables is the main firewall. It talks to the kernel. It's  more complicated.\n\n*ufw wants to make it \"uncomplicated\" (\"ufw\" stands for \"uncomplicated firewall\"). It talks to iptables. It's a command line tool.\n\n*The G in Gufw must stand for \"graphical\", which should provide a click-click interface for ufw. It talks to ufw. It's a GUI.\nNow I hope we could make out their functions and dependencies. ;-)\n\nA: gufw is a graphical front end to ufw which is a front end to iptables.\nSo if you wish to use gufw, you need all 3 packages.\nYou can remove gufw and use ufw or gufw and ufw and use iptables.\nSee also http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/iptables and http://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/firewall-ubuntu-desktops/\n", "Q: Sound is working, but not playing? Running Ubuntu 14.04. Recently my sound for Youtube, Spotify, VLC etc. stopped working.

The good news is that your card is supported through the kernel using ath9k driver. The not so good part, but still good, is that to enable bt, you must manually enable the coexistence on the card. \nIF all is correct, and with any luck, running modprobe ath9k btcoex_enable=1 in terminal will enable coexistence and get it running. \n$$ How do i do that ? \n$$$ can you please explain me ?\n*in terminal just type modprobe ath9k btcoex_enable=1 and hit enter.\nFor more on kernel modules check this wiki\n", "Q: How to stop Ubuntu tracking process? As far as I know Ubuntu is using a process to track user usages and maybe personal information, some like google and other websites use cookies to provide you with \"more suitable add\".

It isn't for advertising purposes.  It is to display information to you about recent files, log events, and other things you may find useful and display some of that information to you when searching in the dash. Some of this information can be shared and you can decide what is ok to share by using the answer from @DnrDevil.  Be aware that this information also has benefits for you as well in the Dash.\nUbuntu does have services for monitoring systems like Landscape that is intended for Enterprise usage, or for a savy individual with many Ubuntu systems and not really for Canonical/Ubuntu Community. \nI think what you may be confused about is Canonical having included in the dash \"Online Search Results\" which are sometimes linked to Amazon links with their affiliate code.  Not exactly tracking your usage of the desktop though.  This will be removed from what I have heard in 16.04 the next LTS.\nAlthough if you don't have a need for this you can turn it all off easily.  You can also easily remove it as well.\nYou can remove landscape if you never plan to use it.  I haven't removed any of these things as I usually just disable them though so make sure you research doing that.\nTo understand privacy here is a great resource - http://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy\nTo disable and move Zeitgeist - Disabling Zeitgeist\nAlso if any Scopes in the Dash bother you, you can always disable ALL of them.  Just right click on the dash plugin while browsing the dash applications tab.

One 1TB HDD (/dev/sda) and one 120GB SSD (/dev/sdb). Windows 8 is installed on the HDD (sda) and Ubuntu 14.04 was installed afterwards on the SSD (sdb).\nNow my HDD is dying: gnome-disk-utility tells me that there are issues and a Seagate tool verifies this. Hence, I made a backup of my data from the HDD and I am about to buy a new 1 TB HDD to replace the old one.\nMy plan is to replace the defective hard drive with the new one and install Windows 10 on it. I have got a Windows 10 key and a iso file from which I intend to create a bootable USB drive. \nMy question is now, how the installation is done in detail. I always read that it is not recommended to install Windows after Ubuntu, because the MBR gets overwritten and so on.\nI am not sure, where grub is currently installed (from gnome-disk-utility I see that /dev/sda2 (type EFI-System) is mounted in /boot/efi, does that mean that grub is installed on sda (=defective HDD)?). I also do not know what will happen if I remove the HDD. Will it still be possible to boot into Ubuntu?\nSo my schedule would be as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all data from /dev/sda (=old HDD)\n\n*Create Ubuntu bootable USB flash drive\n\n*Create Windows 10 bootable USB flash drive (different USB stick)\n\n*Remove old HDD from notebook and plug in new one\n\n*Check if I can still boot into Ubuntu (I guess no?)\n\n*Boot from Windows 10 USB flash drive and install Windows 10 on new HDD\n\n*Boot from Ubuntu USB stick and create Grub menu (this point needs clarification!)\n\n*Done. Dualboot with Windows 10 on new hdd and Ubuntu on \"old\" SSD\n\n\nIs this a reasonable plan? Where might there be problems? What about this whole (U)EFI business - do I have to keep something in mind here?\n\nRemarks after the installation\nEverything worked out without any problems. After removing the old HDD and plugging in the new one, I was not able to boot into Ubuntu again (just as expected). With the Live USB I booted Ubuntu and formatted the new HDD to NTFS. Then I booted with the Windows 10 USB drive and started the installation. However, Windows did not like the ntfs (or whatever) and so it refused to install. Deleting the partition and letting Windows do it stuff resolved this. After the installation of Windows 10, I booted again into Ubuntu with the Live USB, ran boot-repair with the recommended settings and now I got my parallel boot back. Everything works just fine!\n\nA: Your plan sounds good to me. If your MBR is installed on sda then you are right in assuming that you won't be able to boot into Ubuntu easily.\nPoint 7 will be the one that you will want to look at boot repair.\nYour other option could also be to clone your dying drive. If you can temporarily replace your SSD with your new hard drive (or use a USB to SATA connector), you could use dd to copy over the information from your old hard drive. This would save you the reinstallation of Windows, your programs, your data and your MBR. \n\n\n*\n\n*You can do that by having both your old hard drive and your new hard drive connected to your computer. \n\n*Then you start up the computer with a Live CD (or USB). \n\n*Use dd to copy your old drive: sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=16M\nYou will need to replace /dev/sdX with the drive letter of your old drive, and /dev/sdY with your new drive.\nYou can find out the drive letters with sudo fdisk -l .\nYour new drive will be the disk with no partition information. \nIt will take a couple hours to copy it, and you won't see any progress updates during that time. If you want a more verbose solution that will even try to copy bad blocks of data, you can use the excellent 'ddrescue' program as well.\nTo use ddrescue, you will need to enable all repositories in the LiveCD, do a apt-get update and then install it (sudo apt-get install gddrescue). The command is a bit different too: sudo ddrescue /dev/sdX /dev/sdY\nHope this helps. Let me know if you need more information. \n", "Q: error trying to exec 'cc1': execvp: No such file or directory (possible SAGE/python issue) I see that there are a number of topics on this error message, but I've tried every solution I have found to no avail.

For some services (ex: bluetooth) I have entries in both /etc/init.d/ and in /etc/init/ directory.\nHow do I know how this service is started ? By sysvinit or upstart ?\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: You may have two sets of scripts, but you only have one active init system. On Ubuntu 14.04, that's Upstart.\nSo no matter whether your script is under /etc/init.d or /etc/init, the answer for which init system runs your script under Ubuntu 14.04 is always Upstart. \nYou can watch what happens when you try run an /etc/init.d script by using strace to log the system calls to STDOUT:\n sudo strace /etc/init.d/bluetooth start\n\nFirst you'll see that the init script first loads some header functions through /lib/lsb/init-functions\nopen(\"/lib/lsb/init-functions\", O_RDONLY) = 3\n\nPretty soon you'll see the activity diverted to an Upstart related script:\nopen(\"/lib/lsb/init-functions.d/01-upstart-lsb\", O_RDONLY) = 3\n\nThat's just a shell script, so you can open it and read the source to see what it does. \nAs you continue to full the output, I think you'll see that command is redirected to start the script using the Upstart script instead of the SysV init script.\nWhat's interesting to see is that on 16.04, Upstart further redirects the control to systemd, and the related systemd service is started instead:\nwrite(1, \"Starting bluetooth (via systemct\"..., 53Starting bluetooth (via systemctl): bluetooth.service) = 53\n\nThe bottom-line advice to use Upstart scripts and service management commands on Ubuntu 14.04 to avoid the complexity and potential confusion of the SysV init compatibility layer. Likewise, once you upgrade to 16.04, start using the native systemd unity files and systemctl command to avoid involve unnecessary compatibility layers.\n", "Q: How to configure new disk for UEFI boot using grub2 I am using an ASUS N53J that is currently using MBR boot.  I have enabled UEFI booting in the bios can can seem to boot USB drives that have been configured with gpt tables.  Though I have not figured out how to make use of a dedicated EFI boot partition on the USB drive as yet.\nSeparately I have connected a second  hdd to the laptop via the external SATA connection, created a gpt partition table, esp boot partition, and the filesystem and swap partitions.\nWhen I run grub-mkconfig on the internal hdd, it finds the new linux image on the external hdd.  I can boot to that external image and confirm that the esp boot partition gets mounted at /boot/efi, so it appears that I should be able to configure grub2.  However, if I run grub-mkconfig when executing from the external drive, its own image does not get found, only the linux and windows images on the internal drive.\nI also cannot get efibootmgr to run.  The tutorials I have read either are not clear on both the how and the why so I can troubleshoot myself or use commands that I cannot find in the packages I think they are using.  Does anyone have a good pointer on how to configure the disk before I install it as the primary boot disk?\nThanks.\nUpdate 2015-12-30\nI have progressed to making a USB drive that will at least boot into grub rescue.  I do not know why grub won't run from this drive but it at least allows me to manually boot  to my target OS.  Since I have now booted via a UEFI boot efibootmgr is available.  \nI performed a new grub-install targeting the esp partition mounted at /boot/efi.  This completed without errors.  However, when I select the target system for booting the firmware loader stops at a blank screen.  This occurs whether the disk is connected via ESATA or has been moved to be the primary disk in the machine.\nthe output of efibootmgr -v is:\nBootCurrent: 0003\nTimeout: 2 seconds\nBootOrder: 0005,0002,0003,0004,0000,0001\nBoot0000  Hard Drive    BBS(HD,,0x0)\nBoot0001  CD/DVD Drive  BBS(CDROM,,0x0)P1: Slimtype BD  E  DS4E1S    .\nBoot0002* ubuntu 15.10  HD(1,GPT,8b6800c2-0b24-4f00-aa66-b1378052604e,0x800,0xfa000)/File(\\bootx64.efi)\nBoot0003* grub  HD(2,GPT,b07e72fd-9168-4924-a17c-b75e55ed685c,0x800,0xfa000)/File(\\Shellx64.efi)\nBoot0004* UEFI: SanDisk Cruzer Micro 1.26   PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1d,0x0)/USB(1,0)/USB(2,0)/HD(2,GPT,b07e72fd-9168-4924-a17c-b75e55ed685c,0x800,0xfa000)\nBoot0005* ubuntu15.10   HD(1,GPT,8b6800c2-0b24-4f00-aa66-b1378052604e,0x800,0xfa000)/File(\\EFI\\ubuntu15.10\\grubx64.efi)\n\nThe desired target is Boot0005.

Both Boot0002 and Boot0005 behave similarly.\nBoot0003 (grub) is the USB drive and the only means to boot, though it only starts in grub rescue.\nAny ideas where I should explore or what additional information may assist diagnosis?  \nMore progress:\ngrub rescue> set  \nprefix=(hd0,2)/boot/grub  ...

If normal does not start the boot option page the following will:\ngrub rescue>configfile /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nI can eventually get the target to boot from the menu.\nMy synopsis is that grubx64.efi on the USB drive is not configured with the necessary modules for the boot method being used.\nWhile efi-booted into my target filesystem I created a new USB drive, also with a gpt partition table, this time with esp boot as partition 1.  I only mention that to assist with reading the bios boot table presented later.\nmounting USB partition 2 to an appropriate node:\nmkdir -p /boot/efi\n\nmount (USB partition 1) to (USB partition 2)/boot/efi\ngrub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=(USB partition 2)/boot/efi --removable\n\ngenerates EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI.

I now this is getting rather long.  How can I document this to be more readable?\nStatus Update \nBrowsing on the web I have discovered grub-mkimage.  I have not started working with this and will report progress once I have done so and can either understand the results or can pose a new question about it.\n\nA: After experimenting with other hdd's I have determined my problems appear to be related to the esp,boot partition on the original hdd.  When I originally made the esp,boot partition I had accepted the default offset of 1 MB suggested by gparted.  Through exploring why I could boot from USB drives and another hard drive connected via ESATA the common attribute on the successful media was the esp,boot partition being 1st on the drive and with 0 offset.\nMy attempt at moving the esp,boot partition was not successful.  However, I did not check to make sure the UUID and PARTUUID were not modified so I do not know if this failure was due to the move not configuring the disk so the BIOS could figure out how to read it or if I failed by not re-configuring grub.\nIn any case, I learned how to:\n properly move the filesystem to new hdd\n configure the problem hdd from scratch.\n move the filesystem back\n modify /etc/fstab to reflect the new UUID's for mounted partitions\n the esp,boot partition had a copy of Shellx64.efi in its root directory\nI then:\n  reinstalled the hdd into the internal drive bay\n  started the system in BIOS setup mode\n  initiated Shellx64.efi from BIOS\n  typed \"c\" to get to the grub prompt\ngrub> linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2\ngrub> initrd /initrd.img\ngrub> boot\n\nThis started the filesystem (as it always would previously if I had a means to get to grub). This time when I grub-install and grub-mkconfig and  reboot, the BIOS can read grubx64.efi from the proper location on esp,boot partition.

This means that you cannot login as root directly or use the su command to become the root user. Nevertheless, you are able to enable root password by the command:\nsudo passwd\n\n\nNOTE\nEnabling the root account is rarely necessary. Almost everything you need to do as administrator of an Ubuntu system can be done via sudo or gksudo. If you really need a persistent root login, the best alternative is to simulate a root login shell using the command sudo -i.\n", "Q: Missing Steam Packages In Ubuntu 14.04, when I try to install steam via .deb file, it shows:\nSteam needs to install these additional packages: libgl1-mesa-dri:i386, libgl1-mesa-glx:i386, libc6:i386\n\nThen it asks for my password.

Sometimes I want to attach a PDF to an email in Thunderbird. I can drag and drop from Nautilus to Thunderbird, but if I already have the PDF open in Evince, it's nice not to have to hunt down its location.\nCurrently I am using \"Open Containing Folder\" and then dragging and dropping the PDF from Nautilus to Thunderbird, but I'd prefer to skip the additional steps and just use Evince directly.\nCan this be done?\nI am using Ubuntu 18.04, which comes with Evince version 3.28.4.\n\nA: In the options menu in the upper right of the evince window, click on the 'share' symbol (the third one in the row):\n\nThis opens an empty mail window with the pdf as attachment. From there you either write your mail or you can drag and drop the attachment from one mail window to the other.\n\nA: Try File->Save-As from Evince. That will open a dialog that offers to save the PDF with the same filename but instead of going through with the save, just copy the full path to your clipboard (or select the PDF in the save-as dialog and ctl-c to copy). Note that even if you copy a file, it will paste as a path in a text input field. Now in Thunderbird, when you add an attachment, just past the full path of the PDF that you have in your clipboard. Done.\n\nA: In short, no, there is no direct possibility to add a PDF file viewed in Evince as an attachment to an already composed mail in Thunderbird (or other email client). This would need to be implemented in Evince.\nStill, there are shortcuts that eliminate the need to manually hunt down the PDF that is already open in your folder tree in a file manager or in a file dialog.\n\n\n*\n\n*The most direct way is the one you use now: use the menu option \"Open in containing folder\". The file manager is opened with the file highlighted. From here, you can\n\n\n*\n\n*with the mouse: drag into Thunderbird\n\n*with the keyboard, hit Ctrl+c to copy the path, and in the attach dialog in thunderbird or any other , Ctrl+L and then Ctrl+v to paste the path.\n\n\n*The suggestion of Muclux, where you use the \"Share\" function is the shortest possible approach if you want to create a mail with the PDF attached. However, also here it takes extra steps to attach the PDF to an already composed mail. In Thunderbird, you can drag the PDF from the empty message Evince created to another already composed message.

Is this possible, or is there a workaround? \n\nSure you can. If the content is not too large, and if you want to run multiple commands to parse the content, then it's a good thing to cache it in memory rather than re-download every time.\nTo store the result of curl in a variable:\nipinfo=$(curl ipinfo.io/8.8.8.8)\n\nTo run commands on it:\n<<< \"$ipinfo\" awk ...\n<<< \"$ipinfo\" sed ...\n\nThe double-quotes no `\"$ipinfo\" are important to preserve all the whitespace characters.\nA \"workaround\" to not saving the content in a variable is to figure out a way to process the content in a single pipeline, like @kos did. \n\nA: In general there are more appropriate ways of parsing JSON objects, but since in this case the JSON object is very simple you may store curl's output in a variable (which is possible) and just use AWK:\nvar=\"$(curl ipinfo.io/\"8.8.8.8\" 2>/dev/null)\"\n<<<\"$var\" awk -F'\"' '$2==\"city\"{printf(\"%s, \", $4)}$2==\"region\"{print $4}'\n\n% var=\"$(curl ipinfo.io/\"8.8.8.8\" 2>/dev/null)\"\n% <<<\"$var\" awk -F'\"' '$2==\"city\"{printf(\"%s, \", $4)}$2==\"region\"{print $4}'\nMountain View, California\n\nHowever unless you want to use curl's output multiple times you may just use a pipe:\ncurl ipinfo.io/\"8.8.8.8\" 2>/dev/null | awk -F'\"' '$2==\"city\"{printf(\"%s, \", $4)}$2==\"region\"{print $4}'\n\ncurl ipinfo.io/\"8.8.8.8\" 2>/dev/null | awk -F'\"' '$2==\"city\"{printf(\"%s, \", $4)}$2==\"region\"{print $4}'\nMountain View, California\n\n\n<<< is a form of input redirection called \"here string\"; it redirects the STDIN of a command from the terminal to a string.\nWhat happens here is that $var is expanded between the double quotes; the STDIN of the AWK command is redirected from the terminal to the expanded string and AWK consequently reads the string as its input file.\n\nA: Another easy and more readable way to do this, you can use python, which exists in all linux based systems, to parse the json for you \nSimply, Import json and sys packages to load the json object, then print from the result object any property you need: \ncurl ipinfo.io/\"8.8.8.8\" 2>/dev/null | \n  python -c 'import  json,sys; \n             result=json.load(sys.stdin); \n             print(result[\"'city'\"] + \", \" + result[\"'region'\"])';\n\nI added the script in a more readable way however you should put in one line or add \\ by the end of each line if you need to write it in multiple lines.\n\nA: Since the output of curl will be JSON the appropriate/simpler tool seems to be jq (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor):\n$ curl ipinfo.io/\"1.1.1.1\" 2>/dev/null | jq --raw-output '\"\\(.city), \\(.region)\"'\nWhite Hall, Alabama\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 Long boot time issue I installed ubuntu 15.10 on my desktop running on core i7 4930k, nvidia 780ti, 16gb ram, 120gb ssd.\nEvery time I try to boot to ubuntu, it takes around 4-5 minutes.

I then repaired GRUB 2 with boot-repair on a live disk, since GRUB 2 would no longer display and the PC would boot Windows directly.

My question is: are regexes only used with characters or also with filenames?\n\nA: If a filename is a string for you, you can use regex also for filenames. For example: if you want to find filenames matching a regex you can try:\nfind ./ -regex '.*[abc][xyz].*'\n\nThe command looks for files which have a, b or c in the name followed by x, y or z. This is just one example. There are endless possibilites.\n\nA: Regular expressions and file name globbing are two very different things.\nRegular expressions are used in commands / functions for pattern matching in text. For example in the pattern parameter of grep, or in programming languages.\nFile name globbing is used by shells for matching file and directory names using wildcards. The capabilities of globbing depend on the shell. Bash, for example, supports wildcards like:\n\n\n*\n\n** match 0 or more characters\n\n*? match 1 character\n\n*[...] match a character in the specified set\n\n\nThese wildcards may look similar to regular expressions, indeed [...] has the same meaning in globbing and regex. But * and ? mean different things in globbing and regex.\nIn a comment you wrote:\n\nbut how the interpreter difference * whether it's a joker or regex ? for example : grep a*b a*.txt ?\n\nEasy. Sort of.\nFirst of all, the shell tries to interpret the wildcards, by matching them against filenames. If there are files starting with \"a\" and ending with \"b\", the shell will replace a*b with the matching filenames. Same goes for a*.txt. If there are no matching filenames, the shell will pass the arguments to grep as they were, literally.\nHowever, the first parameter of grep should be a pattern.\nIn 99.999% of practical use cases you don't want the first parameter to be interpreted by the shell. So most probably the intention was this:\ngrep \"a*b\" a*.txt\n\nThanks to quoting a*b, the shell will not interpret it using globbing, and instead pass it directly to grep. In turn, grep will interpret that \nas a regular expression (by design).\nTo sum it up, the shell interprets the command line following its own globbing language, which is using wildcards. Commands, programs interpret their parameters in whatever way they were designed by their authors.\n", "Q: Nautilus (Files) 3.18.2 show other partitions as other locations, not under home directory listings In order to be able to install evolution 3.18.2 to Ubuntu 15.10, I had to add the gnome3-team ppa and the gnome3-team staging ppa. As a result, Nautilus (Files) is version 3.18.2. This is a problem (versus older versions) is that other partitions show as other locations, not under home directory listings. Just about all my data are not in my home directory by design.\nHow can I fix it ?\nNautilus (Files) 3.18.2 screenshot\n\nA: It is possible to downgrade nautilus but a better solution is mounting that partition via fstab in a specific directory and then add that directory as a bookmark in nautilus. In order to do this, open the fstab file from this path: /etc/fstab and then add 3 lines to the end of fstab with a structure similar to this:\nUUID=1A2345B678901234 /path/to/dir            ntfs    user,rw              0       0\n\nYou have to replace values in this line with uuid of your file system, directory which you want to mount the partition in, partition type, options, dump and pass. Then click on menu key in nautilus and add mount points as bookmarks to the sidebar of nautilus windows.\n\nA: It's not a bug, but a feature. (Seriously, not a good one, i hate it too :-) )\nA workaround for this is bookmarking your partitions so they appear in the list below \"Other Locations\"\n", "Q: Insalling Ubuntu 15.10 on MSi GS70 2QE I have bought a new Laptop and I use Ubuntu for everything.

If you need read/write access then you have to disable journaling with OS X before you can continue.\nYou can identify the volume with:\nsudo diskutil list\n\nand take note of the volume with type \"Apple_HFS\", usually named \"Macintosh HD\"\nTo disabile journaling in OSX type in a terminal:\nsudo diskutil disableJournal volumeName\n\nIf you want access in rw mode for a non root user you need to change your Ubuntu User ID (UID) to match your UID under OSX.\nAssuming you are logged in as a regular user who has sudo rights. Substitute the username for the Linux user you wish to enable HFS+ write access for and 501 for the relevant OSX UID. You have to modify also the linux UID for the user's home:\nsudo usermod -u 501 <username>\nsudo chown -R 501:<username> /home/<username> \n\nIf there are in your system others files that belongs to the user you can change alla UIDs in one command. Take note of your UID (with id command), then:\nfind / -uid <useractualUID> -exec chown 501:<username> {} +\n\nYou may also want to fix your login screen, by default Ubuntu doesn't list users with a UID < 1000.

Tips for organizing disk space for Win10 and Ubuntu 14.04 To begin with, I have no practical experience with Ubuntu or similar systems so please forgive me if I ask the obvious questions.\nI am intending to buy a new laptop (no OS preinstalled) and set up a Dual Boot for Win 10 Pro x64 (retail from Dreamspark MSDNAA) and Ubuntu 14.04. I have read about dual booting and setting up partitions and I think I can manage this but I would need some advice on disk space organization. I want to set up my laptop once and leave fiddling with the disk space alone.\nMy idea is to set up three partitions (not counting the boot and swap partitions): one for Windows, one for Ubuntu, one for data storage. The OS partitions are intended to store software and OS only, so if anything goes bad i restore the OS and software without loosing data.\nSo the question is: Is it possible to set up a disk partition so it is accessible with read/write privilege under both Windows and Ubuntu? I intend to access and modify Windows software specific data under Win10 (Ansys, Inventor, MS Office) and Ubuntu specific software data under Ubuntu (Latex, OpenFOAM.)\nIf my idea is not feasible or not advisable, please guide me with some tips and tricks on organizing disk space for dual booting.\nKind Regards\nJJ\n\nA: You can access FAT32, NTFS and, with extra packages, even exFAT file systems (mostly) transparently from Ubuntu through the file and disk manager.\nAccessing ext2/3/4 file systems from Windows is very finicky, but possible.\nSo, yes, it's possible to share data on a partition between Ubuntu and Windows.\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 14-3452 BIOS refuses to boot Ubuntu After installing Ubuntu 15.10 x64 (I also tried 14.04 x32), whenever I booted, it told me:\n\nYour system seems to be having trouble starting.

But whenever I click the button to grant access, it reverts back to \"off\" after maybe three seconds. What's happening and how can I solve this?\nP.S.\nI already tried using Pidgin but I still get the same error.  Sometimes I get the \"authorization failed\" error as well.\nAlso, I can log into my FB account using my web browser.\n\nA: A note upfront: It appears that Empathy doesn't support Facebook's messaging service, but Pidgin, a similar multi-messaging client based on the same library libpurple, does with a plug-in as described below.\n\nThe purple-facebook plugin is a replacement for the builtin Facebook XMPP plugin. Facebook is in the process of shutting down their XMPP service, which will inevitably break existing support.\n\n(Source)\nThe following instructions are written for Pidgin and while they should work for the same for Empathy in theory (since they're both based on libpurple), people report that Empathy doesn't accept this plug-in for some reason.\n\nTo install purple-facebook in Ubuntu, Linux Mint and derivatives, you can use its official repository. To add the repository and install the plugin, use the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jgeboski/xUbuntu_$(lsb_release -rs)/ /\"\nwget -O- 'https://jgeboski.github.io/obs.key' | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install purple-facebook\n\nIf you don’t want to add the PPA, you can download the DEB from HERE (but you won’t receive any updates unless you add the repository). Or, grab the source and build it yourself. […]\nOnce installed, add a new account in Pidgin (Accounts > Manage Accounts > Add) and in the Protocol dropdown, select “Facebook”\n  (important: NOT “Facebook (XMPP)”):\nPidgin Facebook I should also mention that in the username field, you can enter either your emil, your Facebook username or phone number associated with your Facebook account.\n\n(Source with some modifications)\n\n\n*\n\n*Official installation instructions\n\n\nAs of October 18, 2015, jgeboski's GSoC work was merged into the mainline Pidgin project. It will appear in the next major release of Pidgin.\n\nThis means, future libpurple versions in Ubuntu (and probably earlier in the Pidgin PPA) will include purple-facebook and supersede the above procedure.\n\nA: If I remember correctly - Facebook changed their API, which effectively prevented several packages from accessing your account and utilizing the API options - such as chat.\nYou can find more information with a simple Google search, for example: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/04/facebook-chat-api-empathy-pidgin-stop-working\nLast I heard, Pidgin and Empathy teams are working on a solution, I wish them the best of luck too.\n\nA: *\n\n*I follow the steps for installing The purple-facebook plugin for\nPidgin. \n\n*I install Pidgin. \n\n*Created facebook account in Pidgin.\n\n*In Empathy, import the facebook account from Pidgin. 5- Removed\nPidgin software after facebook account imported.\n\n\nAnd its working\n", "Q: system-wide git settings I would like to set git defaults for all users on my system.\nWhere can I find the global system-wide configuration?\nThere is no such file as\n/etc/gitconfig\n\nThanks.\n\nA: If you installed the git* package(s) from the default repositories, the system-wide Git configuration is supposed to reside in /etc/gitconfig (since $(prefix) is empty for those Git installations). See the following git-config(1) manual excerpt:\n\n--system\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*For writing options: write to system-wide $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig rather than the repository .git/config.\n  \n*For reading options: read only from system-wide $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig rather than from all available files.\nSee also FILES.\n[…]\nFILES\nIf not set explicitly with --file, there are four files where git config will search for configuration options:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig\nSystem-wide configuration file.\n[…]\n\nIf there is no such file, sudo git config --system <name> <value> will create it for you. Alternatively you can create it manually with your favourite text editor. This is the same behaviour as for global (~/.gitconfig) and local ($GIT_DIR/config) Git configuration files\n", "Q: Windows 10 Ubuntu 14.04LTS I have a PC running on Windows 10 with which I am very pleased.

Some software provides binaries for different releases: Trusty, Utopic, Vivid, Wily, ...\nIn this case, should I download a binary for Trusty or that for a newer release name as far as the software provides?\n\nA: Upgrading your LTS release to a newer kernel line does not change the release name.\nSo you still have Ubuntu 14.04 trusty.\nSee about HWE\nLTS releases allow to install kernels from non-LTS main releases.\nlinux-generic-lts-wily installs the kernel from 15.10 \"wily\" release.\nIt will be default in Ubuntu 14.04.4.\nThis may be a bit confusing.\n\nA: Ubuntu releases and the kernel versions are independent from each other.  \nOpen a terminal and check the Ubuntu release version with this command :  \nlsb_release -a  \n\nThe output shows something like :  \nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.10\nRelease:    15.10\nCodename:   wily\n\nOpen a terminal and check the running kernel version with this command :  \nuname -r  \n\nThe output shows something like :    \n4.2.0-22-generic  \n\nThis was a PC running Ubuntu 15.10 - here is a PC running Ubuntu 14.04 :\nIf you opt into the hardware enablement stack for Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty),\nthe outputs will show that the release still is 14.04 and the kernel is 3.19.\nlsb_release -a  \n\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty  \n\nuname -r  \n\n3.19.0-42-generic\n\n", "Q: Does changing the login password also change the keyring password? I use a computer where I'm not the admin, so my password could be changed at any time. My question is, does changing the login password to my account also change the password to the keyring? I don't want the admin looking at my Chrome passwords. \n\nA: Known facts about the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*The procedure to change the account password includes a hook to update the keyring password in the process.\n\n*The keyring password can only be changed (successfully), when the previous password is supplied to the process that changes it, since the key securing the keyring needs to be decrypted with the old and re-encrypted with the new password.\nAssumption about the \"attacker\":\n\n\n*\n\n*A system administrator running sudo passwd degru (or doing something equivalent) doesn't (typically) know the previous account password for user degru.\n\n\nConclusion: The keyring password is only updated during an account password change, when the account owner changes the password. The system administrator cannot decrypt the keyring simply by changing the account password.\n", "Q: WiFi not working after suspend (14.04) My WiFi did not turn on after suspending.

In fact, it looks like the CodeBlocks IDE doesn't know how to handle it either, so is defaulting to attempting to execute it as a shell script. \nWhen you give your file a .cpp extension the IDE and compiler treat it as C++ code and the file is successfully compiled.\nNote that a .o file is an object code file rather than an executable program: that is essentially the difference between compiling and building.\n", "Q: Installed to external drive, Grub using wrong architecture I installed Lubuntu on a flash drive as you would an HD (not live/squashfs). But whenever I boot it I get a grub rescue prompt.\nIt says it can't find /boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod which explains the rescue prompt. However, it's installed for x86_64. The folder for that arch is there with all the modules. When I did grub-install I targeted it to x86_64. When I try to explicitly insmod it it says wrong arch elf magic. So it is definitely looking for i386 and in the right place, but why and how do I fix it?\nMy question is different than the suggested duplicates because there is no Windows installation on the flash drive, which must be machine-independent. Also, the solutions provided in either do not help - even boot-repair doesn't fix it.\n\nA: I found the solution. It was booting in Legacy mode because it failed to boot in UEFI. The EFI partition contained EFI/Boot and EFI/ubuntu. It was looking for two files, grubx64.efi and MokManager.efi, in /EFI/Boot, but they were in ubuntu, so I did cp EFI/ubuntu/*.efi EFI/Boot and that fixed it! To clarify, the root problem was that the installer put the boot files in a location that is only suitable for fixed drives, and the solution was to cp -r the files to the correct location.\n", "Q: Can't update Google Chrome in Iran Google lets users in Iran to download chrome deb from google.com/chrome, however the repo dl.google.com/linux is inaccessible!\nSo running apt-get update and upgrade results in a lot of error messages.\nIs there an alternate repo for Chrome?\n\nA: Using Tor and torify\nsudo apt-add-repository universe\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tor\nsudo apt-get install torsocks\n\nIf tor and torsocks is also not available, run (for Ubuntu Trusty)\nwget https://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/t/tor/tor_0.2.4.27-1build0.14.04.‌​1_amd64.deb\nwget https://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/t/torsocks/torsocks_1.3-3_amd64.d‌​eb\nsudo dpkg -i tor*.deb\n\nAfter that use torify\nsudo torify apt-get update\nsudo torify apt-get install google-chrome-stable\n\n\nA: I managed to do it using tsocks and shadowsocks:\nsudo apt-get install tsocks\nsudo tsocks apt-get update\nsudo tsocks apt-get upgrade\n\nAnyway this is still slow and annoying.

So I have a Windows folder, let's say F:\\UShare . I want to use/mount that folder inside my VirtualBox Ubuntu installation.\nIt is still unclear to me what I have to do, even after reading this.\n\nA: If I understand correctly - your Windows OS is the host and Ubuntu is the guest VM.\nIf you're using VirtualBox with GUI - just click on a VM and go to it's Settings. In there you'll find the Shared Folders tab - and click the plus sign to add F:\\UShare into the guest.\nThis link might help: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders\nOf course the same can be done using CLI, and if you're not sure on how to do that, please look in here: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html\nTo manually mount the folder open a terminal and use mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda? /media (in which I assumed that your windows hard drive is NTFS formatted - and you should replace the ? in which ever sda is correct in your computer)\n\nA: I had many problems getting this to work.\nThen, I discovered Vagrant. Depending on what you are trying to accomplish with your guest VM, you might do well to use Vagrant. Vagrant provisions VirtualBoxes according to a formula. You search for an appropriate Vagrant file for your purpose (like Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla, etc.) and then type \"vagrant up\" and it all just happens for you. [Of course, there's that bit of learning curve to figure out how Vagrant works and modifying the Vagrantfile, but it's pretty magical to pull a Vagrant file off Github and use it with no mods and, boom, you have an entire Virtualbox in very short order.)\nThe other option is to use Samba to serve files from your Windows host to Linux guest, or vice versa. I use a Samba server on my Linux host to share files with my Windows guest and it seems to work much better than the shared directories. My shared directories got corrupted when things reset or rebooted unexpectedly and that corruption seems to happen less with Samba.\n", "Q: Activate window only if it's on the current workspace I use Unity Desktop Environment and have multiple workspaces enabled.\nSeveral windows are open (some are minimized to the launcher) and spread across my workspaces.

I am using Deluge BitTorrent Client in Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS for handling torrents. I wanted uTorrent Desktop Client (like uTorrent for Windows); I searched couple of times but only found this way of installing the uTorrent server. Am I correct to assume that there is no uTorrent Desktop Client available for Ubuntu (post-14.04 releases included)?\nEdit: if so, why? Does the Linux environment not allow it OR the developers didn't make it?\n\nA: That's right, there's no µTorrent desktop client for GNU/Linux. (see the official download page)\nAlternatives are to use a Wine environment to run µTorrent for Windows or a native Torrent client like Transmission or Deluge. More clients are available through the Software Center with the search term \"torrent\".\n\nA: Transmission has the best GUI, but it is a little low on options. For linux I would suggest ktorrent which with the media player plugins allows for sequential downloads: i.e. watching videos before they complete the download (non copyright ones offcourse). Even µTorrent only does this for paying users.\nBoth allow you to select individual files - see here for Transmission(but be aware that the file will download with the sector it is in - so you might get more than just that file).\np.s.\nQBittorrent also does that- So i would also recommend it.\n\nA: You may be able to download seperate file in a torrent.\nOpen Transmission, click on the torrent, go to the Properties tab and choose only the file (files) you want.\nIf the uploader did their job correctly, the majority do, the torrent should not be only one file but an amalgamation of seperate, smaller, files.\nBut, if you have the bandwidth to spare, do everyone a favor and download everything so you can be a node.\n", "Q: How can we read a VCD disk into Ubuntu?

I then extracted the PPD drivers from a win 7 driver but the printer config program is not detecting them.\nEventually I downloaded the Linux compatible drivers from the Xerox webpage (a .sh file) which I installed with:\nsudo sh <filename>.sh\nhowever, after accepting a Xerox licence agreement, nothing happened and the system still uses the older drivers.\nI am on Ubuntu 14.04.\nWhat can I do to effectively install the correct drivers? \n\nA: Using Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS, I've successfully printed a Test Page to a Networked Xerox Phaser 6600DN. Here is how:\nFirst, Download the aforementioned \"Linux Intel Driver (x64) Debian\" from Xerox's Driver Download Page; but after that, Change \"Operating System\" to ANY Windows version between \"XP\" and \"10\" (32 or 64 Bits), and get the installer for \"Windows XXX PostScript PPD Driver Files\". Inside that little \".exe\" file, there are 4 PPD Files. You want to extract \"xr6600dn.ppd\", and copy it to \"/opt/Xerox/prtsys\" (to keep it available System Wide).\nYou can easily  extract the appropriate PPD File from the EXE with \"7z\", found in the \"p7zip-full\" Package (although, I extracted it with \"7-Zip File Manager\", which runs perfectly well through WINE).\nAfter installing the Linux Driver, run sudo xeroxprtmgr in order to configure the Printer Queue. For this, click on the top leftmost square button in the Interface that will open, to perform a \"Discover\". Then, click on your Printer in the List (IMPORTANT!) to \"Select it\", then click on the left button to \"Add Printer\".\nNow, click on your Printer in the List, then click the top right button, then \"Queue Preferences\". Now, I suggest you jump right to \"Configuration\" (rightmost tab), and click on \"Bidirectional Configuration\"; then click \"Yes\", and enter your Printer's IP Number in the text field, then click OK. By doing that, you'll have real time Printer Status monitoring, plus all your Printer's Setting will be \"imported\". Now you can configure all your Printer's Parameters the you like.\nNow, go to \"System Settings\" --> \"Printers\", and REMOVE any Printer Queue the Xerox Utility might have added by itself.\nNow, add your Printer. It should be automatically discovered in 2 or more \"flavors\", from which I chose the \"AppSocket/JetDirect network printer via DNS-SD\" one (I assume all your Printer's Protocols are \"ON\"). Then, \"Manually Provide a PPD File\" you just stored at \"/opt/Xerox/prtsys/xr6600dn.ppd\", configure a Queue Name.\nApart from the Printer's Name and Description, there is not much you can configure here. Just DON'T TOUCH the \"Connection\" String, and go print a Test Page.\n", "Q: What's goin' with Youtube under Ubuntu 15.10? guys!\nI have problems to access youtube.

I manage my personal website on this server and the only thing I did a couple weeks ago is installed a new plugin from the Wordpress repository, due to lack of time to research a proper configuration I hastily activated it and configured it, and it bricked the front end of my site. So I deactivated it, and decided to give it a go later on. After that the kernel errors started happening. \nSo I uninstalled the plugin completely thinking it might be the cause, but it didn't solve anything. The plugin would have only had write access to my web directory and would not have been able to change any core configuration settings. I'm not sure if there's a connection there, but I thought I would mention it.\nI have also been running this PHP configuration since October with no problems. I haven't added any new/weird modules in PHP. It's basically out of the box, except for a few security precautions. Before seeing the error I executed a dist-upgrade as a part of my regular maintenance:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nThis was around the same time as the plugin installation. In an attempt to fix the errors, I executed the commands again, thinking if there were a bug surely a patch would have been pushed. This, however, didn't help. So I'm at a loss of what I can do to beat this.\nUpdate: I rolled back to a previous snapshot, and everything worked for about a week, then I started getting emails again about the same seg fault issue shortly after Christmas. So I am back to square one.\nAny advice would be great! I'm running LEMP Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server. How do I debug an issue like this? Thank you for any help ahead of time.\n\nA: If you think the error is related to Nginx, you should post your related Nginx logs. There are references to resolver in your logs posted, which might relate to Nginx. \nIf the Nginx resolver is at fault, you might be able to workaround the issue by using raw IPs in your Nginx configuration instead of domain names. \nAlso, check your current version of php5-fpm vs the latest version available in their Git repository. Then check the Changelog for the project for changes that are newer than the version you are using. If there is a newer version available, see about upgrading. \nSegfaults imply a software bug, not a configuration problem. Even if the face of a bad configuration, software shouldn't segfault.  Since it appears php5-fpm was the process that segfaulted, consider reporting the bug on their mailing list or issue tracker if it's not fixed in the latest version. \nIt's also possible the software running via php5-fpm is what segfault'ed and php5-fpm is just the messenger delivering the notice of a segfault. Again, the php5-fpm project will be the authoritative reference for figuring how out segfaults with that software. \n", "Q: Monodevelop and Ubuntu 15.10 I have installed the latest Mono Develop from the project site on Ubuntu 15.10.

It turned out to be an odd entry in the monodevelop.desktop file. I have no idea how it happened, but here's how I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open alacarte (you might need to install with sudo apt-get install alacarte)\n\n*Find the MonoDevelop menu entry (I found it under Other, not Programming - YMMV) and open it\n\n*Change the command from monodevelop /usr/lib/monodevelop/bin/MonoDevelop.exe to monodevelop %F\nIt worked fine after that. I don't know how the command gets changed, but that's why your MonoDevelop installation things it's supposed to be opening that solution.\nIn my case, after I installed monodevelop I started it from the command line, right-clicked the icon in the launcher, and chose \"Lock to Launcher\". Since that seems like a pretty standard practice, I'm not sure how I (and you as well?) managed to end up with the same issue.\nI checked both the main desktop file at https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/blob/master/main/monodevelop.desktop and the linux packaging desktop file at https://github.com/mono/linux-packaging-monodevelop/blob/master/monodevelop.desktop and they look correct to me.\n", "Q: Will I lose my data if I downgrade to 14.04? So I upgraded to Ubuntu 15.04 and I am having A LOT of problems!!!\nI have decided to go back to 14.04 LTS through my CD.. So I just wanted to know if I will lose my apps and settings if I downgrade using the CD, because basically I will be reinstalling 14.04 if I do so.. If yes, is there any other way to downgrade without losing my settings?\n\nA: The application you are looking for is aptik. With this app you can backup yout current application LIST, ppa and their settings. You cannot backup your installed applications. But, since you backed up your application list and their settings, so, next time when you restore your applications, it will download all the previously installed applications, restore your ppas and apply the previous settings on them. \n\nA: Yes, you will lose your data if you reinstall 14.04. And no, there's no proper way of keeping your software. I recommend you to backup your files to an external drive and take note of all the programs you installed with APT (you can get a list of them with the command dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall). After reinstalling, get your files back from the external drive and install your apps again (I recommend doing it from the terminal, it will be faster with sudo apt-get install package 1 package 2 package 3 ...).\n\nA: It depends how you installed ubuntu in the first place. If you made a seperate partition for /home you will lose nothing. Though, by default ubuntu installs /root & /home in same partition. You can check withgparted whether /home is on same or different partition (i.e. sda followed by different number). If in doubt, post image here\n", "Q: How can I export ubuntu terminal's profile in another computers? I use this command to save my current terminal profile settings:\ngconftool-2 --dump '/apps/gnome-terminal' > gnome-terminal-conf.xml\n\nAnd this other command to load profile settings:\ngconftool-2 --load gnome-terminal-conf.xml\n\nBut it does not work. I have Ubuntu 14.04LTS and I would like to export my current terminal profile to other machines that run on Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.04 and 15.10, all this with a Bash script.\n\nA: Have you tried backing up the folder ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal? You can  even try = but it's not the best solution - copying `/home/kostasz/.gconf/apps/gconf-editor.\n\nA: So, the xml file alone will not work from what I understand.

It used to work fine. Since a week or so the connection is not recognized anymore (not shown). My history tells me it has been 11 days ago I last connected. The wireless connection of the router itself is shown and working and other wireless connections (neighbours) are also shown. I tried deleting the connection and adding it again as if it was a hidden connection but that does not work.\nThe wifi connection still works fine with my android phone.\nI tried:\n- resetting router\n- reinstall of broadcom drivers (PCI ID: 14e4:43b1 rev 03) using this:\nInstalling Broadcom Wireless Drivers\nbut did not work.\n\nA: As I have two of these asus repeaters I noticed the other not having the problem.

That part is working. But i need to add some user input that will ask the user before every renaming if he wants to rename the file or not.

The command I have only renames all files that matches the string.\nfind . -type f -exec rename's/(.*)\\/(.*)string1(.*)/$1\\/string2$2string3$3/' {} + ;;\n\n\nA: You could use the find command's -ok action in place of the -exec\nFrom man find\n-ok command ;\n          Like  -exec but ask the user first.

I set the partition of that HDD to autostart in Disk Utility, and ever since I rebooted, GUI would not appear and I would only have a text console. After logging into the console, it tells me:  \n/usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available: 39: /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available/: cannot create /var/lib/update-notifier/updates-available: Read-only file system  \n/usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-fsck-at-reboot: 33 /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-fsck-at-reboot: cannot create /var/lib/update-notifier/fsck-at-reboot: Read-only file system  \nThese 2 errors seem to be related to a drive being mounted as Read-only, however the drive that I applied the mount option to is not in any way a system drive, and has only Steam games on it.\n\nA: After hours of studying the boot process, I had to recreate the fstab file. First of all, I logged into the console as root and entered the command  \nmount -o rw,remount /  \nThis temporarily restored the GUI allowing me to do further work.

I am currently using Ubuntu MATE 15.10.  While setting up Ubuntu, I accidentally selected the Colemak layout when I wanted the QWERTY layout.  Now, when I am entering my password for sda_crypt at startup (which I believe is my LUKS encryption key?), it types in Colemak.\nI've tried changing my default layout from System Settings, but this does not affect the layout I use at sda_crypt.\n\nA: On an Ubuntu 18.04 machine, I did:\ndpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nwith root permissions. That regenerated the initramfs automatically, and I was able to use the new keyboard layout to type the key on the next bootup.\n\nA: I think I've mostly solved this (except the other way round, trying to escape QWERTY), on a 16.04 LTS install.\nSince the prompt is after GRUB, but before the encrypted root partition is accessible, we know the layout choice is embedded in the initramfs (mini file system loaded into memory before the real root filesystem, containing everything necessary to load the real one).\nThe initramfs is built by initramfs-tools, which is a giant list of scripts for copying stuff into there. It looks like the specific one affecting this is /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/console_setup, which re-uses the same /etc/console-setup/cached.kmap.gz that's used (I think?) for the normal serial/tty consoles.\n(I would appreciate some clarity on this if anyone has any. Running dpkg -S on that \"hook\" shows that it comes from the keyboard-configuration package which could be a clue.)\nAnyway, the console-setup keyboard layout comes from /etc/default/keyboard, which has some variable assignments in it. To give an idea how to set this, you can figure it out from your normal xkb layout (this is the one that \"System Settings\" changes), by running this in a terminal:\n$ setxkbmap -print\n\nxkb_keymap {\n    xkb_keycodes  { include \"evdev+aliases(qwerty)\" };\n    xkb_types     { include \"complete+numpad(mac)\" };\n    xkb_compat    { include \"complete\" };\n    xkb_symbols   { include \"pc+us(dvorak)+inet(evdev)+capslock(backspace)+shift(both_capslock)\" };\n    xkb_geometry  { include \"pc(pc105)\" };\n};\n\nMy layout's a bit weird, but the important bits are xkb_symbols ... us(dvorak) and xkb_geometry ... pc(pc105). From this we derive the following /etc/default/keyboard variables:\n$ sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard\n\nXKBMODEL=\"pc105\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"us\"\nXKBVARIANT=\"dvorak\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"\"\n[...]\n\nOnce you've edited /etc/default/keyboard, you need to trick console-setup into updating. I have no idea how to do this so I just rebooted, which seemed to work. (It could actually be because I'd already done the next step before this reboot, although it didn't work this time around.)\nAfter that, just run sudo update-initramfs -u. It will say 'Generating /boot/initrd.img-{latest-kernel-version}' and take some time while it copies a bunch of stuff into a new initramfs image. After that, your next reboot should have the layout you want in the dm-crypt prompt :).\nTL;DR:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/default/keyboard based on the output from setxkbmap -print.\n\n*Reboot (or figure out the proper way to update console-setup).\n\n*Run sudo update-initramfs -u.\n\n*Hopefully enjoy the next reboot slightly more.\n\n\nGood luck and I'm sorry to only have had the same issue now. Maybe in another 18 months someone with the same problem will let me know how it goes?\n", "Q: Some open file dialogs don't see other partitions I tried to get some photos from my second internal HDD (native SATA at Chipset) to Wallch. But I don't see any of my internal and external HDDs in the open dialog's left pane (Places), except for the partition with Ubuntu (see image below). I can see the hard drives in Unity Launcher, but not in the open file dialog. \nI experienced the same with OBS and Variety, so I think it is an Ubuntu problem. Normally I can use the HDDs well and I didn't experience any problems.\n\nUbuntu 15.10/Clevo P771DM/i5-6600K/Intel Z170/970M\n\nA: That's a QT file/folder dialog which doesn't show (un)mounted drives in the left column. This happens because the developer(s) of those applications didn't add places and URLs to the dialog sidebar using QFileDialog::setSidebarUrls().\nYet, you can still access mounted drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the HDD and click on it in the file manager to get it mounted.\n\n*In that file dialog, navigate to /media/<username> or /mnt folders and you should see the hard drive partitions as folders there. You can browse in them the contents of the drives.\n\n\nYou must navigate to the mount point of the partition. There you'll find its contents. You can see mount points in Disks utility (gnome-disks).\n\n\nA: To view all available partitions you can try and use the lsblk command. \nOpen your terminal with Ctrl +  Alt +  T then type:\nsudo lsblk \n\nthis will give you a list of all the drives / partitions available on the system.\nOnce you know the device you can mount it using the:\nsudo mount \n\ncommand.\n", "Q: Upgrade to ubuntu 15.10 Willy Werewolf My latest V14 of Ubuntu asked me if I wanted to upgrade to Willy Werewolf last night. \nOf course I accepted the update and now my whole system is dead, tried to boot in recovery but still get to the same screen.\nRather than spend hours wasted on trying to repair it, Would I be able to successfully reinstall over the top and keep my data?\nI use this as my household server and it had quite a lot of valuable data.\nThanks\n\nA: Okay, first of all try to boot your system using a live CD or USB of Ubuntu. If you already created the one of Wily (15.10) boot with that one.\nInstead of starting the installation, try to access the hard-disk. You should be able to open it from the Desktop or File-Manager.\nLook for the home directory and try to backup it. You can insert another USB-drive or hard disk or anything big enough for your data.\nAfter completing the copy of the whole home directory, install Ubuntu and let the drive to get formatted so you will have a fresh system. \nTry to use the same user-name as you used in previous system so you will be able to access the stuff more easily.\nAfter the installation do not reboot yet. Copy the contents back to the newly created home directory and let it overwrite existing data. \nIf you cannot login after that. Try to change to the terminal (With Alt+Ctrl+F1) and become Super-User.\nYou might need to ensure that you have the right permissions and they might differ compared to the old system.\nFor that from the terminal do the following:\nsudo -i \nchown -R <username> /home/<username>\n\nNow reboot your system with reboot. You should be able to login, unless the contents of your home directory are odd. You might be missing your favorite software which you can install and it might use your previous configuration, for example with pidgin that works very good. You should find your Desktop as you left it in the old system but with upgraded Wily.\n", "Q: Failed to bootstrap during Openstack autopilot installation I'm installing Openstack autopilot on Ubuntu 15.04 server.

Can I somehow set a hook for that? Can I do it with systemd?\nWhat I want to achieve is to mount automatically on login a disk image that lays in the encrypted home directory.\n\nA: An already encrypted home?

I have a laptop an desktop that both have Win10 on them and I was going to add Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit on a side by side install. I've seen lots of issues with machines that already had Ubuntu installed alongside Win 7 or 8, that showed up when attempting to upgrade to Win10.\nI have not seen anything about problems of adding Ubuntu with Grub to an existing Win10 machine. Any dangers in doing this?\n\nA: There is always a slight risk when dealing with partitions on a disk, and there is always that risk that you could corrupt your drive. \nHowever, it will most likely work fine. The 15.04 installer has an Install alongside Windows option built-in, which means you may not even need to mess around with partition tables:\n\nIf you don't want to risk anything, I would suggest booting the CD/DVD/USB and using Try Ubuntu and see if you're happy with it before installing.\nSo in summary: YES there are dangers, but if you don't do anything, you cannot do anything wrong either (nor anything right).\n", "Q: Zombie partitions This issue has evolved. IT'S ALIVEEEEEEEEEE!!!\nAfter giving the disk a brand-new partition table (or that's what gparted would have me think it's done), this is what gparted shows:\n\nHow great! Magical partitions and magical data that I killed a week ago have come back from the dead!\nFine, maybe gnome-disks can help the problem.\n\nEvidently, udisks and gparted are conspiring to make me smash my head on a brick!\nWell, no matter, perhaps it will comply if I format it using gnome-disks... never mind.\n\nThen I tried formatting it with gparted again and it seemed to comply! However, as soon as Ubiquity tried to format it / run partman on it for an Ubuntu installation, Ubiquity crashed as it has before, at this screen:\n\nWhat do I do? Is there a magical tool which will soothe my Ubuntu installation woes, or need I buy a new disk? I really don't want to buy a new disk. I'm poor, okay??\nI'm not tempted to believe I need a new disk, i.e. that this one is physically damaged because it's a few-months old SSD. It never leaves the compartment on my laptop, so I don't see how encrypting it equates to physical damage, but whatever.\n\nA: I am just going to throw this out there, but maybe you can try clearing the memory cells if you don't want any of the data on that drive.  \nHere is a great step-by-step for memory cell clearing on a SSD drive.\n", "Q: Trash Has Reached Maximum Size I'm running Kubuntu 14.04 and my trash folder won't accept any files larger than a text document. Yes, the trash is empty.  I've checked all the related threads here, as well as played with the size settings for the Trash folder in Dolphin, and I've spent a couple of hours on Google trying to find alternative solutions. All I've come up with so far is that this seems to be a somewhat Kubuntu-specific problem, and it's a real pain to resolve. Any ideas or should I just upgrade to v15.10 and hope for the best?\n\nA: It is possible that you put something into trash as root!\nTo access the Trash as root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Then type in the following command:\n\ngksudo nautilus /home/your_username/.local/share/Trash\n\nYou may need to install gksudo with:\n\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\nbe sure to replace the \"your_username\" with your actually username!\nThen delete everything in there (or just items you don't need)!\n", "Q: Is .bashrc correctly setting the graphical terminal title?

It appears the .bashrc author intended it to be displayed in both places just to the left of user@host but in fact it did not make it into both places. The evaluation of debian_chroot happened in defining PS1 but it was not meant to be evaluated at that time, rather it was meant to be evaluated at the time of prompting. The root of the problem is that when building strings \"\" quoting evaluates and '' quoting does not. The evaluation was early because the whole thing enclosed in \\[ \\] was meant for the title. Is interpretation correct?\n\nA: I would say the whole thing is irrelevant. debian_chroot is set in /etc/bash.bashrc. It is a fair bet that, in the normal course of things, if the variable was set, a new shell has been started - why would /etc/bash.bashrc be sourced otherwise? And in that case, ~/.bashrc would be sourced as well. So, either the variable is set when PS1 is set and modified in the lines you show, or it isn't, and it won't be. The effect is the same.\nI can only guess at why the original developer used single quotes while setting PS1 in the first place. Presumably, the dev has learned caution and uses \"\" only when necessary, which it is when modifying PS1.\nNote that :+ just means do nothing if the variable is unset.\n\nA: ${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)} insertion depends on the presence of $debian_chroot variable or /etc/debian_chroot file. \nHere's a simple example. In the screenshot bellow I'm connected through ssh to my Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu Snappy on it, which has $debian_chroot variable set ( by default ), while my laptop's Ubuntu does not. You can see the resulting prompt in the tabs, and in both cases variable for $TERM is xterm\n\nNow if the variable $TERM was something else, it wouldn't alter the GUI terminal title. That could be connecting to a screen session, for example, where variable $TERM is screen. \n", "Q: Unzip .zip on Ubuntu 15.10 I've updated to 15.10 from 15.04. My laptop has a pre-installed Ubuntu since I bought it.\nEvery time I try to open a .zip file, this error message shows:\nPhoto\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The easiest way is with the GUI, right click on the file you want to open and choose \"Open With\" option, scroll down to p7zip, if installed, and use that option.\nIf P7zip, or whatever you use, DOES NOT appear, you'll have to search for it by opening a terminal and entering 'whereis p7zip'.\nGo back to 'Open With', choose other and go to the above directory and choose p7zip, make it the default option, and proceed.\n", "Q: Setting correct permissions on var/www/html/ After reinstalling 15.1 I have a lot of problems with my permissions. I constantly have to adjust them manually. That means I'm doing it wrong. \nHere is what I do: \nI create a folder. The permissions are: Owner: Me, Group: Jos (I'm the only user). Both have create and delete files. With those settings Joomla doesn't remove the installation folder. \nAfter manually removing it I get the error message: \nNo configuration file found and no installation code available. Exiting...\n\nNow I use the command:\nsudo chown -R www-data:jos /var/www/html/my_site\n\nOwner is now www-data (create and delete) Group is jos (create and delete). Installation works fine. Site works. But I can't do anything in it, as I am not the owner. www-data is, and I have only Access Files permission.\nI am using Lamp.\nHow do I set it correctly? \n\nA: Your web user should not have write permission on your content, so to fix this what you should do is add yourself to the www-data group and then flip your chown command:\nsudo usermod -a -G www-data jos\nsudo chown -R jos:www-data /var/www/html/my_site\n\nThen set your permissions to 2755 (directories) and 644 (files) or if you're wanting to be extra secure (or paranoid) 2750 and 640 respectively:\nfind /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\nfind /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 2755 {} \\;\n\nThis will allow your user (jos) to have the write permissions on the content, and the www-data user to have the read permission that it needs. This is also a better security practice as prohibits the www-data user from modifying content thus limiting damage a potential attacker could do. One other thing to note here is that if joomla or some other program does need to modify content in the /var/www/html/my_site folder, I'd recommend manually adding the write permissions to those files/directories only.\nchmod g+w /var/www/html/my_site/joomalwriteshere/\n\nSince I noticed you mentioned joomla here's a link to the source about their recommended permissions: https://docs.joomla.org/Verifying_permissions\n", "Q: cannot access ubuntu after restart chromebook I downloaded Ubuntu on my Samsung Chromebook 2, and I really enjoy it!

I want to automate pulling git repo and building that repo unattended.\nIs there any way I can clone repository and run make immediately after running git clone?\nSomething like:\ngit clone << myrepo >> && make\n\n\nA: An unattended build after a git clone makes not really sense. Most of the time you'll need to install additional libraries beforehand. Partially also configurations are necessary.\nIf after these adjustments, the project can be built, then you can automate the process, e.g. after a git pull using git hooks.\nTo use git hooks, place or link a script with the name post-merge in the .git/hooks folder of the project.\nA simple post-merge script looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\nI have two examples for you that I use myself.

I also booted off of the windows 7 install DVD and it booted with no issue with the 4gigs installed, \nI also tried Ubuntu versions 15, 14, and 12 in the amd64 versions and they all will not boot with the 4gig of ram installed but will with only 3gig. again 32bit versions load without issue with the entire 4gig installed.\nThe laptop comes with 3gig of Samsung memory 1x 2gb, and 1x 1gb.

I have a FS Amilo laptop with 2GB of RAM. I have Kubuntu, Lubuntu, and Puppy Linux installed on it. I chose Lubuntu for speed, but my experience isn't as smooth as I expected. \nThe desktop environment is a bit faster in Lubuntu, but using Chrome or Firefox seems to be in fact slower in Lubuntu than in Kubuntu, which is very puzzling. I have also tried to run Chrome (and Firefox) via an Openbox login, to absolutely minimize other RAM demands, but there isn't any difference (with 2GB of RAM, I wouldn't expect any such issues anyway).\nIs there anything I could check to exclude any fixable issues, such as some RAM settings or other? I should note that browser activity is sluggish even in simple pages (e.g. Facebook), I'm not talking about watching HD videos on youtube or something. \nI suspect the lack of a graphics card is partially responsible (alas, the curse of laptops), but I wouldn't expect this to be such a visible issue. And the perception that Kubuntu seems a bit faster than Lubuntu when the browser is running makes me suspicious.\n\nA: I'm no high fi technical person, but I believe I understand your concern..\nI'll try to explain with a different viewpoint.\nLubuntu is customized to work on a low cpu speed and RAM, when you use system with 2GB or more RAM and multicore CPU's most of the resources are not in use while running Lubuntu, but Kubuntu or Ubuntu uses all the resources of a high end newer computers.\nHave you ever tried to run a Ubuntu 12.10 or higher on Dual Core CPU and 1GB RAM?

Ideally, make sure you can still type if USB is turned off (for example, on a laptop you have a built-in keyboard)\nAs you are saying you are using a server, you could setup SSH to the machine to be able to type if the keyboard gets disactivated while trying this.\nA reboot can probably solve a disabled keyboard as well.\nAs for disabling it on the fly just after booting, put these commands in a script (adapt to your own situation):\nsleep 20 #try if this is needed, needs an increase etc\necho '3-8' |sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind # detach device 1\necho '2-1' |sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind # detach device 2\nsleep 5\necho '3-8' |sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind # attach device 1\nsleep 5\necho '2-1' |sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind # attach device 2\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to install 64 bit ubuntu desktop/server to a Compaq Mini 110?

But when I connected the second pc I lose the internet connection on pc but I won the internet connection on another pc. Basically I can't have two pc with internet connection within the same networking.\nOne of the pc has IP static and the first, which loses internet connection when I connect the second pc, the second pc has Automatic DHCP. But despite losing the internet connection I can access the second PC. Therefore I have networking between all pc on my networking but on the first pc I lose internet connection when connected the second pc in networking (note: the second pc has internet connection despite the first lose).\nHow can I resolve this problem? Which configuration might I do?\nThanks\n\nA: Use DHCP on both PC and try again.\nDoes your ISP allows to connect multiple clients to the router provided by them? Some ISP only allows a single IP through their router/modem. If that is the case you will have to plug the cable from ISP router to a new router and connect the devices to the new router(not an ordinary switch).\nSo first try by using DHCP on both systems.\nIf that doesn't work try different static IP on both systems.\nIf that too doesn't work check if NAT(Network Address Translation) is enabled on router or does it support such feature.\nIf that doesn't work, then please replace the switch with a new router.

I am saving it on external hdd. Now how do I upload that image to my 1 TB HDD thats in my tower. Also should I format that 1TB to EXT4 or NTFS. \nThank you in advance\n\nA: Quick answer... use the reverse (of / if) of your dd backup command to restore to the new medium.  The partitioning and formatting should be automatic.\nOther details:\nTested and verified on Ubuntu 14.04LTS\nCloned with dd (from 50 gig drive):\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda | bzip2 > /mnt2/datadrive/Files/now/image.bz2\n\nRestored using dd (restored to 100 gig raw, unformated unpartitioned drive):\n$ bzcat /mnt2/datadrive/Files/now/image.bz2 | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb\n\nThe restore process restored the the three partitions (sda1 (Ubuntu Install), sda2 (extended partition), and sda5 (swap partition).  It left the other space (as identified by gnome-disk) 54 Gig Free Space.\n\nAn alternate resolution for cloning and restoring is Clonezilla.\nThis is a gui utility that will facilitate both the backing up and the restorer.\nThe only thing you need to be sure of is to make sure the restore-to drive/partition is at least the same size or larger than the backed up one.\nClonezilla has fail safe features such as to alert and refuse to process on insufficient available space.  It also shows a progress status of running time.\nUsing Clonezilla you'll have the option of choosing which partitions you want to bring back to the new media.  To bring back partitions you would first create the partitions using a program such as Gparted.\nThe gparted home page is: http://gparted.org.\nBodhi.zazen provided you with the https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DriveImaging link with details of usage.\nThe specifics from the page indicates that you should use the use the reverse of what you used for your backup... reverse the if and the of values.\nAlso, specific to your question, you may have to format and partition your target drive (ie. /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, etc).\nWhen restoring to a larger drive Gparted can facilitate re-sizing and organizing the extra space.\n", "Q: Cannot find how to disable a screensaver Sorry for a 2nd stupid question in a row.\nCan you please tell me how to disable screensavers in Kubuntu?

At first, the computer was set up with Windows 8. I was recommended to upgrade to Windows 10, once the initial Windows 8 configuration was done, which I did.\nIt's only after configuring Windows that I decided to install Ubuntu, but -not my best move- I only allocated about 18G to my main Ubuntu partition. It wasn't very long before I lacked space on it two days ago. I couldn't do the smallest thing without getting pop-up messages telling me the drive was full.\nI've looked online to find out how I could simply resize my Windows partition in order to cut 20G from it and reallocate it to my Ubuntu partition. I must've done something wrong because right after resizsing my C: drive (after having defragmented it) Ubuntu won't boot. The GRUB screen appears, I select \"ubuntu\" (which I the first and default choice when I boot) and then, after a few seconds of Ubuntu's loading screen, everything goes blacks and I have to reboot.\nI am currently on my LiveUSB. Here are some pictures of the situation, including from the Windows Disk Management (with which I cut off the 20G from the C:) and GParted.\nWindows is installed on sda4, Ubuntu on my sda7. It's on the latter that I'd like to allocate the 19.53G of free space.\nhttp://antoinemalette.com/documents/part2.jpg\nhttp://antoinemalette.com/documents/part3.png\nThanks a million for your help.\nDon't hesitate to ask if you need more informations. True to my habits, I must have forgotten to specify important things.

There, I was given this advice:\n\nBonjour,\nTu bootes avec ton Live USB. Dans Gparted, tu désactives ta swap. Tu\n  déplaces ta partition sda6 vers la gauche. Tu agrandis ta partition\n  sda7 vers la gauche.\nEnsuite, tu vérifies que les UUID sont correctes dans ton fstab. Tu\n  montes la partition sda7 et :\ncat /media/xxxxxxxxxxxx/etc/fstab\n\n(tu peux aussi afficher ton fstab en graphique) Puis :\nsudo blkid\n\nSi les UUID correspondent, tu peux rebooter.\nA+\n\nwhich translates into something like this:\n\nHi,\nYou boot with your LiveUSB. Using GParted, you desactivate your swap.\n  You move your sda6 partition to the left. You enlarge your sda7\n  partition to the left.\nThen, you make sure your UUID are correct in your fstab. You mount the\n  sda7 partition and:\ncat /media/xxxxxxxxxxxx/etc/fstab\n\n(you can also show your fstab graphically.) And:\nsudo blkid\n\nIf the UUID match, you may reboot.\n\nI haven't done it yet, not being home before tonight, but will try it as soon as I get back. I must admit that I'll have to do some preliminary readings as I don't know what UUID and fstab are... Anyway, I'll let you guys know.\n\nA: Bonjour Antoine,\nThe reason your Ubuntu is going black after boot is probably due to lack of disk space as you have mentioned. I don't think it has to do with your defragmentation nor removing 20 Gb from your windows paritions because you haven't physically allocated it to Ubuntu partition yet, reading from your GParted screenshot. \nI believe your Ubuntu will be running normally after properly allocating that 20 Gb. \nFrom your live usb, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click sda6 and select Swapoff\n\n*Right click sda6 again and select Resize/Move\n\n*Drag (do not resize) the block all the way to the left, then click Resize/Move\n\n*Right click sda7 and select Resize/Move\n\n*Resize to include the unallocated 20 Gb into the sda7 partition, then click Resize/Move\n\n*Click on apply all operations (check mark)\n\n\nRestart Ubuntu and let us know!\n", "Q: Mount FAT32: Can't find a valid FAT filesystem Xubuntu 14.04. nfts-3g is installed.\n/dev/sdc is the Flash drive.

The target file is within the same share and permissions aren't the issue.\n\nA: Assuming the ?? in the symlink target are literally ??, you could easily give the symlinks what they are asking for. Namely, just create a directory named /??/D: with sudo mkdir -p '/??/D:' (don't forget the single quotes to keep ? and : from being interpreted as special characters). Then do sudo mount -o bind /mnt/share '/??/D:' to make the contents of /mnt/share accessible also at /??/D:.\nIf this does what you want, you can make it permanent by adding this line to /etc/fstab:\n/mnt/share /??/D: auto bind 0 0\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu support for 5K (Dell UP2715K): adjusting details I've recently purchased a Dell UP2715K which has a resolution of 5120x2880 and have installed ubuntu 15.10 to go with it. The UP2715K is connected to a GeForce 960 GTX (2 displayport cables since 1 cable alone would not handle the bandwidth), and as such the display is actually seen as two 2560x2880 monitors, hardware-wise.\nUbuntu installs just fine, and after installing nvidia drivers the display ran at its native 5K resolution + HiDPI scaling works, and the image is just wonderful. However, ubuntu still seems to think there are two displays for a few purposes, and I still have two small issues: \n\n\n*\n\n*top menus don't go across the whole screen \n\n*maximizing windows only leads to them occupying one side of the screen \nQuestion is: How can I fix these issues? Is there any way the OS will really only see one big 5120x2880 screen?... I tried poking around with display settings + nvidia configs but didn't manage so far...\nEdit:\nUnfortunately the maximization issue also means I cannot view content such as netflix in true fullscreen... which is rather frustrating. No success so far, tried several distros too (Kubuntu, Mint, ...)\n\nA: The driver does see the monitor as one screen but it also tells the window manager that there are two independent panels, which the window manager then uses when maximizing windows. \nYou can enable the Video Wall script in KDE to make it use the whole monitor under some circumstances, like for video players, without using Xinerama. See the answer here.\n\nA: Yes, and no.\nTo make the basic system see one large screen, you will have to enable Xinerama (the NVidia documentation is incorrect in this sense, and states you must disable it).\nHowever, even with Xinerama enabled and basic functionality working correctly, you will still have issues with some things not wanting to work properly, such as attempting to view flash videos full screen, or some games will have issues, only being able to perform full screen on half of the monitor; or just not working at all.\nPart of the problem is Xorg. There are some new features in the latest version of Xorg included in Ubuntu 16.04, which should help with this, but which are still unstable and very difficult to configure, as well as having the problem of not retaining configuration across restarts of the Xorg server. Then there are the drivers. The NVidia drivers are just not as good as they claim to be, and just don't keep in line with kernel and Xorg development.\n", "Q: dependency error while installing openssh client As you can see from the image I am unable to install openssh-client because of dependency error, I have tried this process on a different machine and it worked but it doesn't work on my machine can anyone tell me why?\n\n\nA: Running apt-get install openssh-clients is preferred way as already mentioned, but I just wanted to answer your questions:\nFrom repository using apt-get you will get not only the actual package (deb), but also dependencies (dependent packages). This can't happen when installing using dpkg, because dpkg does not have any information about your repositories and just install what gets as a file. The dependent packages are in different deb files you would have to provide separately.\n\nworks on one machine and why it doesn't work on another. \n\nThe reason why it does work for you on different machine is probably simple that you have libssl already installed on the one machine, but not on the other.\n", "Q: Can't upgrade old Ubuntu, error processing package fontconfig I'm running old Ubuntu Server 13.04 (raring), and trying to upgrade or even install any packages I'm getting the following error:\n\nroot@oem-mobilidade:~# sudo apt-get upgrade -y\nLendo listas de pacotes...

All you would need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the ISO:  http://gparted.org/download.php\n\n*Burn the ISO to a CD.\n\n*Keep the CD in the drive.\n\n*Reboot the computer.\n\n*If your computer does not automatically boot from the CD, enter BIOS or boot options (F1, F2, F9, F10, F12, ESC, case depends on computer), then select the CD.\n\n*You can select to use the defaults, but if your computer doesn't automatically go to the GUI, then go to the next step.  If it does go to the GUI, skip to step 9.\n\n*You will get asked what language and keyboard settings to use.  If you can read English, and have a standard QWERTY keyboard, you can use the defaults.  If not, languages and keyboard layouts are noted with a two digit number at each step.\n\n*If it has issues with your video card, configure it manually with Forcevideo, and then give it the desired resolution with widthxheight (1024x768 as an example).\n\n*By now, you should see the GUI.  Just open up GParted by double clicking the icon.\n\n*Now you should see a window listing the partitions on your hard drive.  Just select the one you wish to erase, and select delete.\nMore information can be found on their web site.

The 3D mode displays both of these correctly. It does not support UDMF however. It will allow you to write ACS scrpts, but NOT compile them. For this I use Slade.

First, make sure you set all the environmental variables correctly (such as ORACLE_HOME) something like one of these should show you the path that is currently set but make sure it is correct by doing an ls on whatever the path is shown:\n$ /usr/bin/env |grep ORACLE\nor use:\n$ echo $ORACLE_HOME\n\nNext, you can try to manually start the listener and replace [listenername] with your listenername store in listener.ora (found under $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/ usually):\n/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/server/bin/lsnrctl start [listenername]\n\nNote: the default path is /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/server/bin/lsnrctl, however yours may be different since your path above is looking for /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin\nIf you can get the listener started then try to connect using sqlplus:\n$ sqlplus\nSQL> CONNECT SYS as SYSDBA\n\nI'm guessing if the installation completed without error (you can check the logs) that it's probably just ORACLE_HOME is set wrong but the logs will reveal the kind of specific error messages that will really help you trouble shoot this.

I'm on Ubuntu Gnome 15.10.\nI am regularly downloading large files (~800 MB), but I have a very slow Internet connection. It usually take a relatively long time to download it. \nSince I am not continuously working on the laptop, it automatically goes into sleep/hibernation mode. \nWhen I press any key after it has gone to sleep/hibernation mode, it wakes up and takes me to the login screen. \nI was able to find the power settings, which gave surprisingly few options:\n\nHowever, I am unsure about a couple of things    \nIs there a way in which my computer does not suspend during downloads, but my screen is still shut off when I am not working on it during download? Are there settings to be made to achieve this, or other solutions?\n\nA: On the edge of a dupe of this question. The difference with that question is however that you want the computer not suspended, but the screen still shut off during downloading large files nevertheless. Although seemingly a small difference, it does make a substantial difference in the answer (script).\nAbout the solution\n\n\n*\n\n*The solution is a background script to run as a Startup Application, that will disable suspend for as long as the download takes.\n\n*At the same time, a second thread inside the script, keeps track of the idle time with the help of xprintidle. xprintidle is triggered by keyboard- and mouse events. After an arbitrary time, to set in the head of the script, the thread shuts down the screen(s), while the other (main) thread prevents suspend for as long as the download is active.\nThe download is noticed by a change in the size of the Downloads folder, as measured by periodically checks, using du -ks ~/Downloads; if the size of the folder does not change any more during five minutes, the script assumes the download to be finished. It then and re- enables suspend.\nNote\n\n\n*\n\n*As always (- should be) with background scripts, the additional processor load is nihil.\n\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nfrom threading import Thread\n\ndef get_size():\n    return int(subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()[0])\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\n\n#--- set suspend time below (seconds)\nsuspend_wait = 300 # = 5 minutes\n#--- set time after which screen should blackout (seconds)\nblackout = 300 # = 5 minutes\n\n\n#--- you can change values below, but I'd leave them as they are\nspeed_limit = 0      # set a minimum speed (kb/sec) to be considered a download activity\nlooptime = 20        # time interval between checks\ndownload_wait = 300  # time (seconds) to wait after the last download activity before suspend is re- activated\n#---\n\nt = 0\nkey = [\"gsettings\", \"get\", \"org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power\", \"sleep-inactive-ac-timeout\", \"set\"]\nset_suspend = key[0]+\" \"+key[-1]+\" \"+(\" \").join(key[2:4])\nget_suspend = (\" \").join(key[0:4])\ncheck_1 = int(get(\"du -ks ~/Downloads\").split()[0])\n\ndef get_idle(blackout):\n    shutdown = False\n    while True:\n        curr_idle = int(subprocess.check_output([\"xprintidle\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip())/1000\n        time.sleep(10)\n        if curr_idle > blackout:\n            if shutdown == False:\n                subprocess.Popen([\"xset\", \"-display\", \":0.0\", \"dpms\", \"force\", \"off\"])\n                shutdown = True\n                print(\"shutting down\")\n            else:\n                pass\n        else:\n            shutdown = False\n\nThread(target=get_idle, args=(blackout,)).start()\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(looptime)\n    try:\n        check_2 = int(get(\"du -ks ~/Downloads\").split()[0])\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n    speed = int((check_2 - check_1)/looptime)\n    # check current suspend setting\n    suspend = get(get_suspend).strip()\n    if speed > speed_limit:\n        # check/set disable suspend if necessary\n        if suspend != \"0\":\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", set_suspend+\" 0\"])\n        t = 0\n    else:\n        if all([t > download_wait/looptime, suspend != str(download_wait)]):\n            # check/enable suspend if necessary\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", set_suspend+\" \"+str(suspend_wait)])\n    check_1 = check_2\n    t = t+1\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses xprintidle:\nsudo apt-get install xprintidle\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as no_suspend.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the desired \"normal\" suspend time (since the script will re- enable suspend), and the time before you'd like the screen to shut down:\n#--- set suspend time below (seconds)\nsuspend_wait = 300 # = 5 minutes\n#--- set time after which screen should blackout (seconds)\nblackout = 300 # = 5 minutes\n\n\n*If you want, you can set other values:\n#--- you can change values below, but I'd leave them as they are\nspeed_limit = 0      # set a minimum speed (kb/sec) to be considered a download activity\nlooptime = 20        # time interval between checks (in seconds)\ndownload_wait = 300  # time (seconds) to wait after the last download activity before suspend is re- activated\n#---\n\n\n*Test- run the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/no_suspend.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > add the command:\npython3 /path/to/no_suspend.py\n\n", "Q: How do I disable mouse acceleration? I tried to install Mouse settings from software center and it works, but i have to run mate-control-center packet every reset\n\nA: I assume you would like to disable mouse acceleration automatically and not running mate-control-center every time. The command to control mouse acceleration is\nxset m <acceleration> <threshold>\n\nI guess\nxset m 0 0\n\nwould disable acceleration completely. You can experiment with parameters until you find the setting you like. When you are satisfied with the settings you can start the program with your settings (How do I start applications automatically on login?).\nThis is copy from xset manual for the mouse parameters explaining the parameters:\nThe m option controls the mouse parameters; it may be abbreviated to 'm'. The parameters for the mouse are 'acceleration' and 'threshold'. The acceleration can be specified as an integer, or as a simple fraction. The mouse, or whatever pointer the machine is connected to, will go 'acceleration' times as fast when it travels more than 'threshold' pixels in a short time. This way, the mouse can be used for precise alignment when it is moved slowly, yet it can be set to travel across the screen in a flick of the wrist when desired. One or both parameters for the m option can be omitted, but if only one is given, it will be interpreted as the acceleration. If no parameters or the flag 'default' is used, the system defaults will be set.\nIf the 'threshold' parameter is provided and 0, the 'acceleration' parameter will be used in the exponent of a more natural and continuous formula, giving precise control for slow motion but big reach for fast motion, and a progressive transition for motions in between. Recommended 'acceleration' value in this case is 3/2 to 2, but not limited to that range.\nIf you will not be able to get the proper xset settings, I have found also that disabling acceleration with xset is not a proper to do any more. It says on https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mouse_acceleration#Disabling_mouse_acceleration:\nDisabling mouse acceleration\nMouse acceleration has changed dramatically in recent X server versions; using xset to disable acceleration doesn't work as it used to and is not recommended anymore.\nRecent changes on PointerAcceleration can be read here.\nTo completely disable any sort of acceleration/deceleration, create the following file:\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"My Mouse\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"yes\"\n    Option \"AccelerationProfile\" \"-1\"\n    Option \"AccelerationScheme\" \"none\"\n    Option \"AccelSpeed\" \"-1\"\nEndSection\n\nand restart X.\nSince libinput1.1.0-1 and xf86-input-libinput0.15.0-1 you can use a flat acceleration profile which will give a 1:1 mapping of physical to virtual mouse movements. To enable it put this in the following file:\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"My Mouse\"\n    Driver \"libinput\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"yes\"\n    Option \"AccelProfile\" \"flat\"\nEndSection\n\nand restart X.\n\nA: One way is by writing a script and enabling it at startup applications\nTo do that type the following command:\ngedit /path/to/script/anyname.sh\n\nThen, add the following lines to the file:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n\nmate-control-center\n\nexit 0\n\nNow, save the file. Go to dash and type startup applications. Then, add the following in the Command section:\nbash /path/to/script/anyname.sh\n\nFilling up the rest of the fields is completely up to you. \n", "Q: mounting network attached hdd( mybook) on ubuntu permission denied I have tried following the suggestions at How do I access an external hard drive plugged into my router? and tried both the usage of smbfs as suggested by the accepted answer(gave problems with smbfs) and cifs (as suggested by @LEO). which resulted in an error mount error(13): Permission denied after sudo mount -a. \nThe hard drive in question is a mybook external hard drive that has recently been formatted to ntfs (received it this way) and is supposed to function both as a NAS and backup disk. It is attached to a DLINK dir885lr router. When connected via USB rather then network Nautilus doesn't have full access to the disk either but I can use the terminal to operate on the disk. Any solution is welcome and I'm fine with formatting the disk however it would be nice if it remains possible to use it to store backups for a windows and linux system as well as serve as a general dumping ground for files to be shared between systems (multiple partitions?)\n\nA: The mount error is being caused by a rejection of the user in general, so it does not mean there is a problem with read / write rights on the disk.  \nThe method explained in the provided link tries to access the shared drive via a guest account, thought some router might allow this by default I think most do not.\nFor the mentioned router please check via the webpage of the router:\n\nhome>usb device>go to settings>windows file sharing enabled>Allow all users to access\n\nSince the filesystem is translated to CIFS or SMB it will not matter which filesystem you use as long as it is accessible by the router, for this NTFS will be just fine. (In fact I can not even find if the router will be able to read EXT3 or 4, mostly this means it does not!)\nRegarding your difference between Nautilus and terminal (this is actually a separated question), this appears to have been a bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/1021375\nand should be solved doing:\nRemove /home/[username]/.config/nautilus directory and restart or logout and in again.\n", "Q: Can you configure postfix in ubuntu to send a automated email when a user submits php webform?

Is there any reason to use a third language to accomplish this?\nSimply configure the sendmail_path in php.ini and use PHP's mail() function.\nSummary of the instructions\nStart by configuring PHP to use sendmail, by modifying sendmail_path in your php.ini file.\nOpen /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini in a text editor.\nUpdate the line already containing sendmail_path. If no such line exist, simply add it on a new line.\nIt should look something like this:\nsendmail_path = \"/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i\"\nNow you can use a simple PHP script to send mail instead of saving it to a database first. There might still be good reasons for saving the mail to a database, such as logging and traceability, but there is nothing preventing you from combining the two methods.\nReplace your PHP code with the following (Note, this is untested code, so make sure you understand it and test it before putting it into production)\n<?php\nif (isset($_POST['Enter'])) {\n    $to      = $_POST['name'] .

Many plugins synchronize the video output to the audio output (so that it does not get out of sync) and can cause extremely laggy playback if there is a problem with sound.\n\nyou should try out the solutions from the Pipelights help page first. E.g.: Bad performance / Install 32 bit graphic driver files.\nYou can also try to get the direct stream from your site and try to play it with VLC Player. Just install VLC, start the terminal and run:\nvlc -vvv http://ecache4.m2d1.cdn.onet.pl/ceph/d15b4bf9-dff4-45d1-a39d-6d95f519e29e.1451738861.317688.mp4\n\nI extracted the link to the MP4 file using developer tools of Google Chrome. You can do the same if the link isn't working anymore.\nAlso using -vvv option will tell VLC to print all kind of output messages. You should look for some warning or error messages like: picture is too late to be displayed etc. You can also check how many frames were lost by clicking Ctrl+I and going to the Statistics tab.\nIf the same problems appear using VLC you can be sure that this has nothing to do with your Pipelight plugin. I would then suggest to download  the video and try to play it offline:\nwget http://ecache4.m2d1.cdn.onet.pl/ceph/d15b4bf9-dff4-45d1-a39d-6d95f519e29e.1451738861.317688.mp4\nvlc -vvv d15b4bf9-dff4-45d1-a39d-6d95f519e29e.1451738861.317688.mp4\n\nIf the video plays without any problems now, then probably something is wrong with the TCP transmission. Here you can play around with Wireshark and sudo sysctl -w ... commands.\nIf the offline video playback is also lagging, then your system is either too slow, or badly configured.\nI hope that I could help you a little bit.\n", "Q: How can I downgrade openssl via apt-get? After a recent upgrade, I am having some SSL connection problems.  I would like to downgrade openssl temporarily to see if the issues go away.\nThe current version of openssl installed is 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.32 and the previous version was 5.31.  However, when I try:\napt-get install openssl=1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31\n\nI get:\nE: Version '1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31' for 'openssl' was not found\n\nI thought this was the correct procedure for installation a specific version?\n\nA: I do not believe that a downgrade will solve your problem. But you asked:\nThe package openssl=1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31 isn't longer in the Precise repositories, because the latest version is now 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.32. But the package is still available in the PPA of the “Ubuntu Security Team” team.\nFor version 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31\nwget https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+build/7531893/+files/openssl_1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i openssl_1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31_amd64.deb\n\nBut I suspect that you have to downgrade other packages listed here.\nThe downgrade is temporary. After a\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nor for a better feeling a\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nthe latest version will we installed again.\n\nA: According to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl, there is no version 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31 of the package openssl in any 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) repository any more.\nThe only available versions of openssl for 12.04 as of today (2015-12-30) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*1.0.1-4ubuntu5.32 from the main repository's updates and security channel (2015-12-07)\n\n*1.0.1-4ubuntu3 from the main repository's release channel (2012-04-19)\n\n\nThe 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31 version you want to downgrade to was replaced and is no longer available. You can only downgrade to 1.0.1-4ubuntu3, if you don't mind a 3 years old version (which probably contains a few serious bugs and security holes!) or find a PPA hosting a not that outdated version of openssl.\n\nA: Apt can only install stuff that is actually in the repositories. Superseeded packages are removed from the respositories. Debian makes older versions of their repositories available in an apt-get compatible form on snapshot.debian.org but I don't know of any direct equivilent for Ubuntu.\nOlder versions of ubuntu packages are available for download on launchpad. Unfortunately the procedure for finding them is not especially obvious. As far as I can tell you will have to manually download such packages and install them with dpkg -i\nIf you go to a source package on launchpad (e.g https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl ) you can click on \"view full publishing history\". This will take you to a page with a long list of versions. Find the one you want and it will take you to a page for that version (e.g. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31 ) on that page you will find links to the builds for different architectures and those pages will have download links for the packages built from the source. You can then download them.\nNote: in thie case the links for the builds go to pages referencing the \"security team PPA\". Afaict this is because security updates are first built in a PPA and then only later migrated to the main ubuntu archive.\nP.S. Note that the \"openssl\" binary package contains tools. The openssl libaries (which are what I think you really care about) are in the \"libssl1.0.0\" package.\nP.P.S If you don't want your next run of apt-get upgrade or similar to upgrade the package again you will need to set up some form of hold or pinning to stop it doing so.\n", "Q: How to purge SDDM/Plasma completely I recently installed KDE just to give it a go. I didn't really like it, so ran sudo apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop plasma-desktop. That seemed to fix it initially, after two reboots everything was back to Ubuntu and using lightdm as the login manager.\nHowever, it has since started this very annoying habit of using sddm as the login manager. This then messes up all sorts of stuff, including sound and TTYs 1-6.\nSo, I figured I would run sudo apt-get purge sddm and be done with it. Wrong, I get this:\n$ sudo apt-get purge sddm\n[sudo] password for user: \nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information...

When lightdm is the login manager everything works just fine.\nIs there any way I can stop this from happening?\n\nA: I ended up resolving this as far as I can tell by running sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm and selecting lightdm instead of sddm and rebooting.\nThen, from the login screen I was able to enter TTY1 via CtrlAltF1 and run sudo dpkg -R sddm. \nThis seemed to work, as sddm is no longer an option under dpkg-reconfigure lighdm and I've had no issues since with the audio or graphical glitches.\n", "Q: Can't get Juniper working on Ubuntu 14.04 The pieces work but whole does not I really need some help troubleshooting this. \nI've been here already: \nHow to install Juniper VPN on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?\nhttp://mad-scientist.us/juniper.html\nThe client opens and then closes.

I made a bootable usb for ubuntu,however when I was trying to install it,I saw instead of showing 'install alongside windows' it was showing 'install inside windows'.Then through a bit of searching over internet I found that it shows such type of options when you have 4 partitions already.So next time I clicked 'something else' in the installation dialog box and it showed something like this.Now being a newbie I am totally struck how to tackle this problem so please help.\n\nHere is a link that shows : \nmy partitions in windows ,[how to adjust so that I dont loose data]\nAnd one more thing I dont know why but it is showing windows 8 in the ubuntu installation dialog box while I have windows 10 installed in my pc\n\nA: Backup first, things can go very wrong when changing partitions.  Then it looks like you have \"dynamic\" partitions, instead of \"basic\", which is a problem -- those \"dynamic\" partitions need to be converted to basic first.  Then it looks like you have enough free space in the \"G:\" partition (59G) for a root and swap.  \"G:\" is 100% free, so looks like it may be deleted, then the Ubuntu installer can make the partitions needed in the free space (or do it yourself in \"something else\").  \nIt isn't clear to me if this is a UEFI machine, or what disk partitioning (gpt or msdos) is used.  If msdos is used, then you will need an extended partition to hold the new logical partitions you create.  If gpt, then you can just make the new partitions.\n\nA: You can create extended partitions, that can have multiple partitions within them.\nChoose \"try ubuntu\" from your USB, and open Gparted application from ubuntu. From there you can create an extended partition.\nIt should look at little like this when you are done:\nHere\n", "Q: How do I find all custom-created symbolic links in the entire system? I've created several symbolic links in different places.\nI can't really recall where each one of them is in the system and I've already removed programs they are associated with.\nIs there a script / program / whatever that can search the entire system and remove any symlink which is custom-created?\n\nA: find . -user \"$USER\" -type l\nLists all symlinks under the current dir and subdirs created by your user. This also means created by a program your user (you) started, but if you can remember creating the listed symlink it should be fine. Verify the last access time if unsure. If you also want to follow the links, pass -L.\n\nA: As you have removed the associated/target programs, they should become broken. So it should be easy to search for broken symlinks:\nfind . -type l -exec sh -c \"file -b {} | grep -q ^broken\" \\; -print\n\nChange . for different search folder.\nSource: How can I find broken symlinks\nYou can also filter using expected link name or target name instead of testing them.\n\nA: There's no way to distinguish \"custom-created\" symlinks from \"non-custom-created\" symlinks.\nIf all of them were created without sudo / being root you may use this, which will output the full list of symbolic links owned by your user (which should be very short):\nfind / -xdev -user \"$USER\" -type l\n\nOtherwise you're out of luck.

I cannot get the powerdirector 9 software that came with my ion video 2 pc adapter to install. I keep getting an error message that says something about error loading the archive. Also, I can't get my canoscan lide 110 software to install, either: same issue. They both worked fine in Windows 10. What gives?\n\nA: PowerDirector is a Windows-only program, so unless you have WINE installed, it unfortunately will not work under Ubuntu.\nThere are three ways we can go about this:\nFirst Method:\nYou can install WINE and then try to install PowerDirector under WINE. However, it appears that (at least with version 8) it doesn't work well with WINE.\nIf you want to try this, I suggest looking at this very extensive answer.\nSecond Method:\nThe second option you have is installing and using an alternative to PowerDirector such as openshot , Cinelerra, or kdenlive . I personally recommend Kdenlive, however, OpenShot is a bit simpler and easier to use for basic editing.\nThird Option:\nThe third way would be to install Windows inside of VMWare/VirtualBox. This would give you access to an actual Windows environment where PowerDirector would run natively.\nHowever, you will get less performance out of a VM than you would previously had when you were running on Windows, as the computer is essentially running two OSes at once.\nIf you decide to go with this method, I suggest reading this question for a more in depth solution for installing Windows.\nHave your pick of these three. I wouldn't suggest using WINE, for the reason listed, but either of the other two are fair game.\n\nAs for your second issue, you should just be able to use the included scanner software, Simple Scan, after installing the proper scanner drivers via\nsudo apt-get install sane xsane xsane-common sane-utils libsane libsane-common libsane-dbg libsane-dev libsane-extras libsane-extras-common libsane-extras-dbg libsane-extras-dev\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Concerning the software for the PowerDirector, you're trying to run Windows software in a Linux environment.  You might be able to get it to run in WINE.  If you don't already have WINE installed, just open up terminal (default shortcut keys are CTRL+ALT+T), and run:\n\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nThen you can run the Windows installer by right-clicking the .EXE file, and then selecting run with WINE.\nYou can also try the various editors under Linux.  My favorite so far would be OpenShot, which you can install in terminal the same way as WINE:\n\nsudo apt-get install openshot\n\nAs far as the drivers for your Canon Lide 110, you should be able to use the included drivers in Ubuntu.  On the software side, you can use Simple Scan to scan and save documents and photos.\n", "Q: Milter-greylist socket always owned by root?

Your new server is behaving correctly, but you haven't configured your private network to accept that behaviour!\nYou would do best by leaving .local in the server name, and adding .local  to the TCP/IP search domains on your various clients.

An Ampersand in the replacement part is replaced with the text that matched the pattern. An example:\n$ before=\"time&again\"\n$ after=\"to&fro\"\n$ sed \"s/$before/$after/\" <<END\n> hello\n> world time&again !\n> END\nhello\nworld totime&againfro !\n\nSo, the matched text time&again is replaced by to&fro, except the & between \"to\" and \"fro\" is itself replaced by the matched text.\nThe solution is to escape the ampersand in the replacement side. Using bash parameter substitution will give the desired results:\nsed \"s/$before/${after//&/\\\\&}/\"\n\n", "Q: Wireless driver for Lenovo Ideapad Y700? Is anyone working on a wireless driver for the Lenovo Ideapad Y700 ?\nI bought one for my son, who is in high school. The deal was that he had to run dual OS (Windows and Ubuntu) get familiar with Ubuntu, but at the moment the only way to establish a network connection with Ubuntu on this PC is by cable not the best \"sales argument for Ubuntu\" for this dad.\nWireless controller: Intel 8260-AC (rev 3a). \n\nA: While I am not running dual-boot, I did install Ubuntu 16.04lts on my new Lenovo Ideapad Y700 (first thing I did after making a disk image), and wifi worked out of the box.

When I boot linux from my USB, the install option won't show the win7 os so I get the no os options and the advanced options, which I'm not familiar with as a linux novice. Any advice on how I can get the Win 7 os to show up?\nI took this snapshot after extending my partition back out to see if that would fix the problem.\n\nI also tried running bootrepair after partitioning my hard drive again. Extending it didn't fix it.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/14297910/\n\nA: I have seen this before. Windows does not always write data in sequential order on a drive partition. When you resize the partition or create a new partition outside of Windows it is possible to delete part of the MBR or OS as it is not stored in the earlier sections of the partition. What this means is if Windows has written data to a sector is on the partition that you've shrink you will have no noot or corrupt OS. This is also part of the reason why users have trouble cloning a larger hard drive to a smaller SSD and this explains why you are not able to boot into windows anymore. The best solution is to reinstall windows and create your correct partition size then install Ubuntu in its own partition.\n", "Q: cron.hourly sendmail errors even though my scripts do not involve sending mail I have only one very simple shell script in /etc/hourly.cron.

Any help would be appreciated. \n\nA: By default, any output produced by things run by cron is sent by e-mail to the owner of the crontab. To disable this, either make sure your scripts do not produce any output, or redirect it to /dev/null in your crontab, or add MAILTO=\"\" at the top of your crontab.\n\nA: Just set in top of the cron file\nMAILTO=\"\"\n\nAnd no mail will be send\n", "Q: The time on the clock is wrong ubuntu 14.04 I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 on my Lenovo G50-70 yesterday, removing windows 10. When I boot up the machine, the clock was showing the wrong time, even though the timezone was correct. The clock was running ahead by three hours. How do I fix the clock?\n\nA: I got a workaround. I used the following command to set the hardware clock to correct date and time:\nsudo hwclock --set --date \"mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss\"\n\nand then used the following command to sync it with system clock:\nsudo hwclock -s\n\nI logged out and back in, and the problem was solved.\n\nA: Check this for details about setting up NTP synchronization.\nUbuntuTime\nFrom the above page:\nCommand Line ntpdate\nUbuntu comes with ntpdate as standard, and will run it once at boot time to set up your time according to Ubuntu's NTP server. However, a system's clock is likely to drift considerably between reboots if the time between reboots is long. In that case it makes sense to correct the time occasionally. The easiest way to do this is to get cron to run it every day. With your favorite editor, create (needs sudo) a file /etc/cron.daily/ntpdate containing:\n#!/bin/sh\nntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nMake sure that you make this new file executable:\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/ntpdate\n\n\nA: If your computer has only Ubuntu installed, you should change the hardware clock (in the BIOS or whatever your computer uses) to UTC time, as this is how Ubuntu expects it. Right now, it is probably set to your local time, since that is how Windows expects it.\n\nA: Goto NTP and check your zone for ntp server. Then, type the following to set it to your zone:\nsudo service ntp stop\nsudo ntpdate -s YOUR TIME ZONE SERVER ADDRESS\nsudo service ntp start\n\nThis should update and correct your time.\n\nA: Answered by utamav: This is a common problem when dual booting with Ubuntu/Linux. Linux gets it's time from BIOS assuming it is UTC while Windows does it assuming it is your regional time. So each OS keeps messing the time for each other. The easier way is to change time in Linux. \nIn linux, go to:\n/etc/default/rcS\n\nChange:\nUTC=yes to UTC=no\n\n\nA: For me none of the above worked. \nThe solution I found here worked for me:\n    $ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime\n\nA: try this out, it worked for me.\nopen system setting, choose time&date, try changing zone and revert back to your timezone. This surprisingly seems to work on my local system.\n", "Q: Black screen after Grub2 menu with Live USB on Acer E15 with Windows 10 I just bought an Acer Aspire E15 (E5 573G-71L9) with an NVIDIA Geforce 940M, Intel Core i7-5500U processor, 15.6'' FHD LED LCD, and Windows 10 Home pre-installed. The default boot method is UEFI - Secure Boot.\nI created 700 GB free disk space by shrinking the Windows partition in Windows 10. I created a bootable USB stick using the Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu with an ISO of Ubuntu 15.10 64-bit (the checksum is correct).\nAfter having changed the boot order to have the USB stick first, I got the GRUB2 menu. After selecting 'Trying Ubuntu without installing', I got a blank/black screen. The 'working light' on the USB stick did not flash anymore, indicating that nothing was happening.\nI tried the following proposed fixes, without success:\n- Replacing 'quiet splash' with 'nomodeset' (assuming it was the graphic card)\n- Using an external monitor (for the same reason, using both 'quiet splash' and 'nomodeset')\n- Setting the boot method to 'Legacy' (no valid boot device was found)\n- Disabling 'secure boot' in UEFI (still blank screen after grub)\n- Adding the two files in BOOT/EFI (or was it EFI/BOOT..) to trusted boot methods and putting them on top of the boot order (still blank screen after grub)\nWith that, it looks like I covered virtually all suggestions given in 'similar questions' and I have no clue how to continue. Suggestions, pointers to similar questions that I may have missed and other help would be much appreciated. Thanks.\nUpdate 1 January 2016: in addition, I tried to run the live USB of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Mint 17.3 (normal and compatibility mode). I also burned Ubuntu 15.10 on a DVD. In all cases, after having selected an option from the menu, I got a black screen. Both the CPU and the graphic card are used in 'Ubuntu certified systems'. \nAre there any tests that I can carry out to find the probable cause of the black screen?\n\nA: This answer was given in the Acer community: \"Have you installed the latest BIOS?\"\nUpdating the BIOS from version 1.25 to 1.31 did the trick indeed. The reason is that version 1.25 did not support Linux at all (probably a bug).\nIt still did not work out of the box: I had to manually add \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi to the boot sequence in order to get the GRUB menu (the entry was not automatically added).\nSo now I have a working Ubuntu environment. But... the wireless lan is not working. I will have to look into that tomorrow, but looking at the first quick search results, it seems that the network card is not supported...\n", "Q: I want to wipe a new laptop of Windows10 and install Ubuntu from an iso on a flash drive Long story short, bought the gf a cheap new laptop for Christmas, and it only has a 32gb drive.

I know that you can just open up Archive Manager and extract them. But what is the actual difference? Which should I use? What flags should I give tar to extract them in CLI?\nEDIT:\nWhat is the difference between the xz algorithim and the gz algorithim?\n\nA: The .tar (standing for Tape ARchive) files are  the ones created by the tar utility. It is capable of putting several files in one single package, but it can't compress them. That's where the .gz, .xz and .bz2 extensions enter. The gz format provides the best speed but a \"regular\" compression ratio. The bz2 format provides a mid-term between speed and compression, while xz is excellent when talking about compression but a little slower.\nThe big difference between .tar.gz/bz2/xz files and .zip/.7z/.rar files is that the \"tar\" ones pass through two processes to reach their final forms while the others do it in a single step.\n\nA: Tar allows you to pack multiple files into a single file, while the other extensions (gz, bz2, xz, lzma, etc.) are the compression types. Specific to your question, .gz compression is the fastest and largest, while .xz is much slower and more effecient.\nAccording to this question from 3 years ago, tar can recognize and extract the files without any special flags.\n", "Q: How do I get two Eclipse sessions running at the same time? When I used Windows I could simply click the Eclipse icon and run a session, then click it again to run another. This way I could compare 2 different projects.  With Ubuntu 15.04, is there a way to do this?\n\nA: I take it you don't want to use tabs to compare the projects, anyway I'd recommend that if you use Eclipse from the Ubuntu repositories-which are very very outdated-to download an updated version from the official website https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\nFor the Mars release there is a helpful Eclipse Installer or just download and extract the package you require.  \nTo start open the file \"eclipse\" within the extracted folder. Opening this file again gives you another Eclipse instance. You can drag the icon into the Unity toolbar for easy access. Generally running more than one instance is only a problem if the same workspace is being used, because when saving modifications one instance would interfere with the other.   So if you want to compare 2 different projects in 2 instances of Eclipse just have them in different workspaces. You could just quickly copy a workspace into the same directory, call it workspace2 and open the other instance using workspace2. \nWhen playing around until you get the setup you need, a backup of your workspace(s) isn't a bad idea\n\nA: It's a duplicate question. Btw, you may do as directed here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/118243/open-multiple-eclipse-workspaces-on-the-mac\nI did exactly same on Ubuntu 14.04LTS and it worked perfectly. Give it a try.\n", "Q: error message not enough disk space I have a older macbook, which is a 13 inch laptop. I was running OS X Lion and decided to erase my hard drive and start over with Ubuntu. Now when I try to download Ubuntu or other software, I get an error message that says I do not have enough free disk space to even start the download. How can this be if I just erased my hard drive? In addition to this I am not sure I erased my computer correctly. I am not computer savvy and will appreciate any insight for this problem. \nHere is the latest error message: Safari could not download the file “regservo_2.0.5.0.exe” because there is not enough free disk space.\n\nA: *\n\n*On a computer install Ubuntu onto a usb drive.\n\n*Boot onto the drive.\n\n*Click on install Ubuntu.\n\n*Continue through the installer until you get to something like this:\n\n\n\nYou want the one that says \"Erase Ddisk and install Ubuntu\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Click install now!\n\n", "Q: dig times out while host works I'm currently running a relatively fresh installation of Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 on a notebook connected via Wifi. Other network interfaces are present (mobile broadband, ethernet) but apart from the lo interface not connected.\nWhen running dig example.com or dig @8.8.8.8 example.com the query times out while host example.com works fine.\nThe network routes fetched via route -n look fine to me. As far as I'm aware there are no filters present on this network.\nI've used Debian from only command line for a few years, but I'm quite new to Ubuntu - especially with a graphical shell. I'd appreciate your help!\n\nA: The timeout of the response from 8.8.8.8 in your network maybe greater than 15s, the default timeout of dig command. You can use +time to set the timeout for a query to n seconds. The default timeout is 5 seconds. And also use +tries set the number of times to try UDP queries to server to n instead of the default, 3:\ndig +time=10 +tries=5 @8.8.8.8 example.com\n\n\nA: O.K. something weird is going on here. This problem is not Ubuntu related, but caused by some sort of weird network filtering on the network I'm using. As to why this is or what causes this I have no idea.\nApperently UDP based DNS lookups are blocked on the AP I was connected to or by the ISP. Appending the +tcp flag to dig fixed that and so does changeing the network (I couldn't try that before due to the lack of an alternative). \nFrom what I can tell from here the ISP is Versanet (Germany) and the network uses both gear from TP-Link and Netgear. Since this is not my network I probably cannot really dig much further here.\nThank you Tung Tran for your help anyway.\n", "Q: Can't select to boot another operative system after installing Ubuntu on a secondary drive I have a Windows 10 machine installed on an SSD, installed another hard disk and I installed Ubuntu 15.10 on it. I didn't specified anything when installing, but now it boots directly into Ubuntu. It doesn't give me the option to select which OS to boot. \n\nA: First try to go into your Terminal Ctrl+Alt+T.\nNext type in:\nsudo grub-install\n\nwait for that to finish, then do:\n sudo grub-update\n\nFinally restart your computer and see if the windows 10 shows up in the boot menu, it might say windows 8 loader which is what mine says.If that doesn't work I will look for something else.\n\nA: You have one of two options, here they are:\nOption 1. Type Ctrl+Alt+T\nand type in the following command\nsudo grub-install\n\nonce that finishes do:\nsudo grub-update\n\nnow restart your computer and you should see a list of operating systems.. \nChoose whichever you prefer / want.\n-\nOption 2. Power off, and then turn on your computer..\nWhile it is turning on press the f12 button on your keyboard.\nYou should see a list where you can select windows (using your arrow keys)!\nGood luck!\n\nA: Enter the boot menu when you're at POST screen and choose your SSD, it should boot into Windows 10 as long as you didn't modify the MBR.\nYou can as well edit the default boot drive in your BIOS.\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes when copying files to shared drive Ubuntu 15.10 64bit\nWhen moving or copying files to either a USB Pen Drive or a Network Share Drive Nautilus (Files) hangs. The copying/moving process starts but then freezes. I know Ubuntu cannot handle large files, however, the file I am moving is only 922MB (.MP3).\nI've tried using the cp (copy) command in terminal but now the terminal hangs. A file does sometimes copy, but a file this size can sometimes take up to 30 mins.\nI have tried both on a wireless and hard wired network connection.\nI have no internal Firewalls.\nI can copy to the Network Share Drive, which is on a PC running Ubuntu 14.04.3LTS using SAMBA, from my Win7 PC with no issue and from an old laptop running Linux Mint17.\nWhen looking at System Monitor, I am barely using any CPU or Memory when this issue occurs, so it does not appear to be a lack of memory, etc.\n\nA: This is very odd that you're seeing it with all of your attempted tools (Nautilus, cp etc.) and that you're seeing it on both USB and Samba shares. That's suggestive that something else is going on.  I would recommend installing iotop (must be run under sudo/root):\n$ sudo apt-get install iotop\n$ sudo iotop\n\nThis will help you get an idea for what's going. If things look like they're hanging you could throw in a 'sync' command to see if something is getting hosed up with the file getting stuck. \n$ sync\n\nAlso using:\n$ top\n\nCan allow you to monitor the process to see if it's hanging.\nFinally, I use rsync for my network transfers (for a variety of reasons like the ability to resume and to view progress) so you may want to explore using rsync.\n$ rsync -v --progress /path/to/myfile /path/to/destination/\n\nThere are other reasons you could see this too that could be related to hardware or impending hardware failures. \n\nA: I think it may be a bug, I read that gvfsd-trash uses excessive CPU usage, though I did not record this. However, by limiting gvfsd-trash cpu usage I found it resolved the issue. So, hopefully future updates may resolve this issue.\nI used this here to limit this process, seemed to work for me.\n", "Q: I run a \"outdated\" command that may have harmed Ubuntu! I run a possibly dangerous and unpredictable command, please I need help in reverting wichever changes it may have done. Without reinstalling Ubuntu if possible.

And the dangerous part is that even if the command is suggested on a Ubuntu help page, the page itself says it's outdated at the top and should not be used various times.\nThis is the official prompt (and starts with the command typed).

So, far so good, but there was just one part in your command that might have caused some problems. The part of the command where it said:\nlinux-image-`uname -r`\n\ndeleted your active kernel and then re-installed it.

If you recently spilled anything on your laptop or eaten near it, you might have a stuck key. Not stuck enough to show up in the full OS, but enough to cause GRUB to beep.\nIf you pop off the key-caps on the keyboard and clean underneath them, that might resolve your issue as sometimes little bits of food (or even just stuff from regular use) can get underneath the keys.\nEDIT: We were able to figure out the issue in chat. \nOP had to edit the /cdrom/isolinux/menu.cfg file and edit the menu title Installer boot menu^G line by removing the ^G from the end.

And then select 'Ubuntu Recovery Mode'\n\nThis will bring you an utility that will help you to recover most of the common problem caused during booting. \nSelect a menu option and press Enter to use it:\n\n\n*\n\n*clean: Attempts to make free space on your file system. If your storage is full and this is causing some sort of problem, this can help free up space.\n\n*dpkg: Repairs broken software packages. If a package failed to install properly and your system doesn’t work because of it, this may help.\n\n*failsafeX: Boots your computer in a failsafe graphic mode. If there’s a problem with your Xorg graphical server configuration or graphics drivers and that’s causing your Ubuntu system to boot to a black screen or preventing the graphical desktop from loading properly, this can get you back to that graphical desktop.\n\n*fsck: Performs a file system check, which scans the computer’s file systems for errors and automatically fixes them. \n\n*grub: Updates the GRUB boot loader. If you could use the GRUB boot loader to get to this menu, this option probably won’t help.\n\n*network: Enable networking, which is disabled by default in recovery mode.\n\n*root: Leaves the menu and goes to a root shell prompt. From here, you can mount the file system in write-mode and run commands that may help fix problems with the system. You should only do this if you know what you’re doing — it’s a way to fix the problem by hand if you know how.\n\n\n\nIf Problem still persists Reinstall your Ubuntu\nTo do this, insert Ubuntu live DVD or pendrive and boot from it. Start installing Ubuntu. While doing this, Ubuntu should find your existing installtion and should give you option to reinstall it. Choose Option 'Reinstall Ubuntu', this will keep your files and programs as it is withtout any problem. \n(Though it's still good idea to keep backup of your important data, just in case)\nThis should solve your problem.

Ubuntu 14.04\nI know that Ctrl + Pagedown/Pageup is used for tab switching\nAlso we can change it in Edit > Keyboard shortcuts.\nI want to change the shortcut to Ctrl + Tab (forward) and Ctrl + Shift + Tab (previous) but it doesn't let me do so. I am habitual of changing tabs with these keys (as in browsers). Is there anyway to change the shortcut to Ctrl + Tab?\nSo far I am using ` and ~ (exactly above the tab key) for my ease. but tab would be wonderful.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: This has been known for years. Referring to this bug report from 2007 it says:\n\ncomment from upstream:\n\"There are a couple of keys which are not candidates to be keyboard\n  accelerators, independently of the modifiers. Tab is one of those\n  keys, as it (with various combinations of modifiers) are reserved by\n  gtk for its own use and the window manager.\n\nIn other words, for gnome-terminal Tab is a special key and you cannot use it as part of a shortcut.\nThe alternative I can suggest is to assign Ctrl + Tab to the xdotool key Ctrl+Page_Down command.  xdotool is a program that allows simulating mouse behavior,key presses, and window controlling functions (very very versatile tool). I have used it quite a lot, so by this point  if it's installed by default, so you will need to install it with sudo apt-get install xdotool. Basically you will be pressing Ctrl + Tab but xdotool will simulate the Ctrl + Pg_Down. Same idea with the reverse cycling shorcut.\nThe big disadvantage is that this is a global action, meaning that if some other program has Ctrl + Tab shortcut that isn't for tab switching, it will definitely conflict with that program. Another disadvantage is that you cannot hold Ctrl and keep on pressing Tab repeatedly. Only the whole shortcut works and once at a time.\n", "Q: Keystrokes Delayed or Missing in SketchUP Under Wine I am trying to use SketchUp 2016 Make under Wine 1.7.\nKeystrokes seem to be delayed or missing. For example after choosing the Move/Copy tool, pressing the Ctrl key to invoke the Copy function sometimes works immediately, sometimes it has to be pressed several times or holding it for several seconds before the + sign emerges.\nSame for selecting elements and hitting the Delete key. Sometimes it works, sometimes the same annoying behavior. \nUbuntu version is 15.10.\nThanks for considering.\n\nA: Do you play games? Is there such a problem, or is it specific to only this app? If you have no such a problem anywhere else, then most probably it is caused by a partially (or not at all) implemented function — then I'd advice you to update to wine 1.8, and check if the problem persists. If it's still there, consider filling a bug.\n\nA: I had the same problem, after installing SketchUp the shortcuts did not work (wine 1.7.x and 1.8.0). I solved it by resetting all shortcuts in the SketchUp shortcuts menu (Window - Preferences - Shortcuts - Reset all).\nGrtz\n\nA: I am using wine 1.8 ubuntu 14.04 and sketchup 2016 64bit. I had loads of trouble getting keyboard input to work properly for shortcuts. I had to hit a key multiple times or hold it down so it repeats.  I changed the windows version to 10 in wine configure for sketchup and it now works as it should. \n\nA: Please ignore my other post I inadvertently ignored the first rule of fault finding, only change one thing at a time. Ubuntu 14.04 wine 1.8 sketchup 2016. Shortcuts called by keyboard strokes stop working reliably when the default tray in sketchup is brought up with the instructor enabled. The workaround is to disable the instructor in the tray selector menu. Something in the instructor is messing with the keyboard focus. After doing this you need to restart sketchup to make keystrokes work again.\n\nA: I reset all my keyboard shortcuts didn't work.

That being said you may get more bang for the buck choosing a different SSD that does not have capabilities only available for Windows.\nedit: second thought, that piece of software should not really be of any concern, its a good SSD for Linux.\n", "Q: gdisk unable to write GPT table I'm trying to recover a disk which appears to have a corrupt ID for the protective MBR.\nYesterday I took a backup of the GPT and protective MBR, and dumped to file.\nAt that time fdisk reported the MBR type ID as 83, where it should be EE for a protective MBR.\nThanks to a great set of pages at http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/gdisk.html I decided the best course of action was:\n\n\n*\n\n*invoke gdisk and select the GPT option (it was showing MBR as present, but not in protective mode).

This almost always signifies failing hardware, which is also consistent with your other symptoms. I recommend you check the disk's SMART status to see if it's failing. If SMART says the disk is OK, you could try replacing its cable or moving it to a different SATA port (if the computer's a desktop), since bad cables and connectors can sometimes cause problems. If the SMART results look bad or if a cable swap doesn't help, you may need to replace the disk.\n", "Q: My cat stepped on keyboard, now VLC has no sound As described in the title, my dumb ass cat stepped on my keyboard, and now VLC has no sound. \nI have determined that it is not a problem with the speakers or connection by playing youtube videos with sound.

In my case, i have a GPS connect via RS-232 (DB-9) to USB cable to Raspberry PI (Raspbian SO), for that i use ttyUSB0.\nIn the line that says fname, you can indicate the destiny and name for the file to want capture the info.\nIf you want to use .dat or .txt format its no problem.\nAnd one thing more.

That makes me think, this might not be a good idea.\nSo, is this possible at all, and if yes, is it a good idea?\n\nA: That's not how .deb packages work. They contain pre-compiled software, you can't just make a deb package with source code. I have a suggestion: why don't you make a .tar.gz package containing your source code and a script to compile it?

For background, I previously asked this question.\nI am using stderred to turn stderr text in red when diplayed on a terminal.  This works nicely on most occasions, more specifically for what appear to be binary executables as opposed to bash scripts.\nI realized that stderred does not appear to work when stderr is referred to directly from a command called from a terminal.\nFor example, using stderred I still do not have red if I use redirection as with the following:\necho \"pomme\" 1>&2\n\nHow is redirection any different than other cases with regards to the stderred hook?\nHow can I have red for stderr output if I redirect 1>&2 in a /bin/bash context, as I do in my bash scripts (Ubuntu 15.10)?\n\nA: If you look at stderred's README, you'll note that it modifies the write() function (and associated stream functions):\n\nstderred hooks on write() and a family of stream functions (fwrite,\n  fprintf, error...) from libc in order to colorize all stderr output\n  that goes to terminal thus making it distinguishable from stdout.\n  Basically it wraps text that goes to file with descriptor \"2\" with\n  proper ANSI escape codes making text red.\n\nEmphasis mine.\nWhen you redirect stdout to stderr, they point to the same thing, true. However, the function calls that wrote to stdout still refer to it as stdout, no matter what redirection you do. They still access file descriptor 1, not 2.\nIf you want to write to stderr, and have it coloured, normal shell redirection will not suffice. You'll need to use something that writes directly to stderr. The awk function in the similar Unix & Linux post can be adapted to work with multiple arguments:\nerror () (\n  IFS=' '\n  awk -v msg=\"$*\" 'BEGIN { print msg > \"/dev/stderr\" }'\n)\n\nI used /dev/stderr since that's easier to read and mentioned in the GNU awk docs. Also note that I have used ( ) instead of { } for command grouping. This causes the commands to be run in a subshell, so I can safely modify IFS without the calling shell or script being affected.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal codes (ANSI/VT100) introduction on the Bash Hackers' Wiki \n\n*ANSI escape codes on Wikipedia\n", "Q: Custom command - one less than current brightness level I tried using xbacklight, but it wasnt working so I made some custom global commands to control the brightness.

UEFI is a step forwards and Microsoft is supporting 3rd party OSes to their best efforts on Windows certified x86 platforms (that is what you actually buy, a piece of hardware some manufacturer designed according to Microsoft's requirements, Linux is just compatible to this platform, like many others that may be inferior in design, locked or crippled in performance like Chromebooks).\nFormer Microsoft CEOs may have said stupid things but don't let statements from past times cloud your judgment, we're not in the 1990's anymore, Microsoft hires new talent and anti-FLOSS agenda may have already been unpopular in the company during the last years where Ballmer was still CEO.\nSo check that you are booting UEFI and everything will be easy: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nIn case you still have to boot MBR, then muru is right: How can I install Windows after I've installed Ubuntu?\nYou can setup a EFI system partition and probably tar-backup an existing MBR partitioned installation then restore it to a GPT partition table to utilize all space on big drives and add as many partitions for different operating systems as you like once you figured out how the parts come together. I repeat UEFI is a step forwards.\n\n2) Here are my partitions:\n\nShould I just increase the size of the unallocated space? Or create a new partition?\n\nYou're really asking a question about Elementary on a Ubuntu-only site. You're on the wrong site. Please migrate/transfer your question to the correct SE site. Everyone who claims that Ubuntu sites or any other not-directly to the project related site is a proper support channel for Elementary users is deliberately misguiding users or too lazy to properly answer questions. Stop listening to these people.\nThat being said check the type of your partition table (you probably have a working UEFI setup), be careful and read up how to properly resize LVM.\n\nA: It should be easy if you have an Ubuntu (or elementaryOS or whatever) Live media (CD/DVD/USB). The big trouble of installing Windows after your Linux system is that Windows' bootloader will overwrite GRUB. Install Windows and boot from your Live media. Open a terminal and run:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nReplacing X with your disk letter (if you have only one disk, which is probably true, the letter will be a) and Y with your Linux OS' partition number.\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX --root-partition=/mnt\n\nAgain, replacing X with the letter.\nsudo chroot /mnt\nsudo update-grub\nexit\n\nNow reboot and GRUB should be back as the default bootloader. Done!\n", "Q: Share files in one house Ok here is the situation, there are few pc in my house, so I want to share files from one file to others. Samba is not an option, it finally broke on host ubuntu pc. before today only windows 10 pc couldn't connect to this pc now it is fully broken.\nSo i want an open-source app (some other way) that will allow me sharing files from one pc to another \n\nA: There are a number of file sharing resources.  However, the easiest is actually Samba.  Out side of using Samba you may have to install something special on Windows to access the shares.\nSome common share resources are, NFS and FTP.\nSharing with Samba (easiest)\nMicrosoft file sharing is already activated by default on Windows machines.  It's easily configured on Ubuntu.  You might consider posting (in another question) a description of the error's problems you're having with Samba and have a simpler solution.\nOn Ubuntu you can actually activate the Windows file sharing just by browsing to the folder you want to share (from the default file browser, Nautilus), right clicking on it, then click Local Network Share and then answer the gui prompt for configuring access.  Local Network Share is also one of the tabs when clicking on properties of a folder.\nFTP Sharing\nTo sharing via FTP install vsftp.\nTo consider ftp for both uploading and downloading you'll have to edit the /etc/vsftpd.conf file.\nYou would have to uncomment the write_enable=YES option if you want others to be able to upload files to the shared space.\nYou can manage users by creating accounts for the users you want to give access and uncommenting the local_enable=YES option.\nThere are other details for setting it up of which you can get by reviewing  ubuntu's documentation page, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/vsftpd.\nNFS sharing\nReview the Ubuntu NFS documentation at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo.\nFor this you would create directories that you want to share and specify the access parameters.  For instance (from the documents page):\n/export       192.168.1.0/24(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)\n/export/users 192.168.1.0/24(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)\n\nThe directories that you specify for sharing are referred to as exports.\nWindows will have to be specifically configured to access the NFS shares.  You might have to get details from one of the Windows forms for the details of setting up the Windows Client.  Micorsoft has provided this page: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732891.aspx\n", "Q: i8kutils i8kmon uses wrong thresholds after resuming from suspend Laptop is Dell Inspiron 15 3521. No dedicated GPU, right fan only.\nI have it set to only turn on the fan at 70 C, but when I close my laptop and open it again, it starts turning on the fan at some random temperature between 53 C and 60 C. It keeps the fan running until it gets below 50 C. None of my thresholds are set like this. Restarting the i8kmon service seems to fix the problem temporarily. How do I fix this permanently?\nHere's my i8kmon.conf:\n# Sample i8kmon configuration file (/etc/i8kmon.conf, ~/.i8kmon).\n\n# Kernel I8K status file\nset config(proc_i8k) /proc/i8k\n\n# Kernel APM status file\nset config(proc_apm) /proc/apm\n\n# Kernel ACPI status file\nset config(proc_acpi) /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/0/status\n\n# External program to control the fans\nset config(i8kfan) /usr/bin/i8kfan\n\n# Applet geometry, override with --geometry option\nset config(geometry) {}\n\n# Run as daemon, override with --daemon option\nset config(daemon) 0\n\n# Automatic fan control, override with --auto option\nset config(auto) 1\n\n# Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option\nset config(verbose) 0\n\n# Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option\nset config(timeout) 5\n\n# Temperature display unit (C/F), override with --unit option\nset config(unit) C\n\n# Temperature threshold at which the temperature is displayed in red\nset config(t_high) 80\n\n# Minimum expected fan speed\n\n# Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n# These were tested on the I8000.

Apparently when going to sleep and resuming the i8kfan settings are not retained and control is given back to BIOS or whatever controls the fans by default. Having i8kfan 0 0 automatically run on resume fixes the issue. \n", "Q: GNU Grub Boot Screen My Asus laptop was working fine and one day, I got an error screen when I started it and the top says \"GNU GRUB version 1.99-21ubuntu3.4annan1\".

After completing step 4 of OpenStack Autopilot Test Drive, the autopilot-config script will also print out a large message banner on the command line which will direct the user to the URL where Landscape (the Autopilot) is running and the credentials you need to login and see the cloud installer.\nAlternatively, if you missed that message on the console when you last ran autopilot-config you can still dig up those details for the Landscape URL and credentials cached in /home/ubuntu/deployer.cfg file.\nThe file is YAML, and you will want to point your browser to the IP specified at maas-server:ipaddress. The credentials for your install are in the openstack-services section as admin-email and admin-password.\nIf you want a script to report the 3 items out of YAML, here is an ugly one-liner that you run on the command line where your deployer.cfg lives. It will extract the URL for the autopilot UI and credentials from the YAML.\npython -c 'import yaml; cfg=yaml.load(open(\"deployer.cfg\")); print \"https://{} Credentials: {} / {}\".format(cfg[\"maas-server\"][\"ipaddress\"], cfg[\"openstack-services\"][\"admin-email\"], cfg[\"openstack-services\"][\"admin-password\"])'\n", "Q: ceph version on ubuntu ports repository for armhf I'm trying to install the lastest version of ceph on my armhf platform.

I am trying to concatenate multiple JPEG images into a single PDF document. \nI used LibreOffice to make a great thumbnail collage, but it isn't acceptable to the agency to which I am trying to send it.

My son put Ubuntu on my laptop a couple months ago and I am not as familiar with it.\n\nA: You can use LibreOffice to save as a PDF, DOCX, or pretty much anything Word can do. To save as a PDF in Writer, simply click File and then Export as PDF... about halfway down. If you happened to use Impress or any other LibreOffice program, the steps are exactly the same. \nTo save as DOCX from Writer, go to File >> Save As... and change the All Formats box in the bottom right of the window that pops up to Microsoft Word 2007-2013 XML (.docx). Simple as that ;).\nIf you need, I can edit my answer to include images.\n\nA: A command-line way is to use the convert command from the imagemagick package:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\nconvert file1.jpg file2.jpg … filen.jpg  output.pdf\n\n\nA: img2pdf can do this:\n\nLosslessly convert raster images to PDF. The file size will not unnecessarily increase. It can for example be used to create a PDF document from a number of scans that are only available in JPEG format. Existing solutions would either re-encode the input JPEG files (leading to quality loss) or store them in the zip/flate format which results into the PDF becoming unnecessarily large in terms of its file size.\n\n\nA: Agreed to zacharee1 answer , but still if you can't find pdf option just press alt and write pdf , you would be shown an option export to pdf\nif you don't know how to do something , just press the alt key , write that something and below would be the options , click on it.\n**If you still can't get it  , update the question , there are many alternatives to do the above and if you think , your problem would be solved by microsoft word then do the below steps\n**\nsteps to install microsoft office in ubuntu :\n\n\n*\n\n*press ctrl + alt + t\n\n*type sudo apt-get install wine\n\n*enter the password, no letters would be shown , but enter the correct password \n\n*press enter\n\n*Download Microsoft Office from the website \n\n*after downloading the office , right click on setup.exe\n\n*open with -> other application\n\n*select wine, (if you can't find wine , then click on the view all application button and then scroll and find wine\n\n*press ok\n\n*install microsoft office next -> next -....->finish\n\n*insert your images in word\n\n*go to file , export and convert to pdf\n\n*although this procedure is long but you can run any windows program in ubuntu\n\n", "Q: Telnet and Firewall I would like to transfer file from one machine to another using telnet.

When I click to turn on VPN, it flickers to \"on\" for not even a second, but then immediately goes back to \"off\".\n\nHow can I diagnose and fix this problem? It seems to be limited to just Cinnamon, though I can't understand why a desktop environment would treat VPN differently.\nUpdate: I found this error by running sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog:\nNetworkManager[636]: <error> [1451684252.150609] [vpn-manager/nm-vpn-connection.c:1980] get_secrets_cb(): Failed to request VPN secrets #3: (4) No agents were available for this request.\n\nI looked it up on the internet, and found suggestions that I should clear out the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory, reinstall network manager with sudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager, and then reinstall Private Internet Access. Unfortunately, none of this helped and the problem persists exactly as before. The same error message in syslog still occurs after having taken all these steps.\n\nA: Maybe some of the following can help:  \nReinstall following package:  \nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n\n\nPIA-Ubuntu OpenVPN\n\nWhen in Cinnamon have you tried manually adding a OpenVPN connection or importing a saved VPN configuration from Network Connections?\nTo import a saved VPN configuration go into:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Network Connections. Click Add.\n\n*Select: Import a saved VPN configuration. Navigate to where the .opvn file is (usually /etc/openvpn). \nIf you can't find the .opvn files (or don't have them) on your system:\nhttps://www.privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn.zip\n\n*Gateway and CA cert may have entries filled in, along with other provider specific details in Advanced settings. Note \"Connection name\" (not Gateway) or change it to something that stands out for you e.g. \"testLondon\" if you picked a London gateway.  \n\n*Enter your User Name and Password (you can choose to store it or ask every time) from PIA and save.  \n\n*While connected to the internet select this new connection e.g. \"testLondon\" from your drop down menu, depending on your settings it may or may not ask for your VPN password.\nAn attempt to connect to your Gateway will be made and a un/successful notification should pop up.\n\n\n\nAfter seeing your error log and trying the following, the Cinnamon GUI did seem a little glitchy but if it's not a username/password problem then I have no idea what it is. \nSo I finally found a friend with PIA and installed Ubuntu 15.10 with Cinnamon on a VM: \nAfter a base Ubuntu 15.10 install, I installed Cinnamon using package:\ncinnamon-desktop-environment\nupdated the entire system and rebooted into Cinnamon desktop then followed PIA-Ubuntu OpenVPN, after installing relevant packages it asks for username (or rather number).  \nWhen the script was finished I got the same GUI that you've posted. I then clicked the VPN Connections toggle switch to ON and then it immediately turns OFF (I expected this as I had no password for any VPN gateway, so there was no default VPN gateway to connect to). \nI then selected \"PIA-AU Melbourne\" from the list and a \"Authenticate VPN\" dialog box pops up, I entered the password and a few seconds later got a system notification telling me that the VPN connection has been successfully made. A white dot appears in front of \"PIA-AU Melbourne\" in the GUI list. I checked the ip and yes it's Australian. I then checked PIA's site and yes it's a PIA ip. Success so far.\nI wanted to log what was going on for the next connection so I clicked the VPN Connections toggle switch to OFF and ran sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog I clicked the VPN Connections toggle switch to ON and it connected to \"PIA-AU Melbourne\" straight away (no dialogue box as the password is now stored in the keyring). No problems in syslog.\nWith syslog still running I then selected a different gateway, \"PIA-Brazil\", the password dialogue box came up again but I selected cancel and got a similar error log as you did in syslog (). I selected \"PIA-Brazil\" again, input password and no problems again. So the only thing I can think of in your case is a username/password problem.\nIf the password dialogue box (probably the user agent) didn't pop up for you, after running the PIA Ubuntu script again, go to Network Setting from the GUI in your picture and select any PIA profile e.g. \"PIA-AU Melbourne VPN\" and go into its settings and check if your password is in there (your username and other settings should already be in there because of the PIA Ubuntu script). Then select that gateway from the GUI in the pic. Maybe try it out in a VM first\n", "Q: QtCreator scroll jumps after mouse click I've already asked on the Qt forum, but apparently Ubuntu users aren't there.\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place the cursor somewhere.\n\n*Scroll down with a mouse wheel so the cursor is not in sight any more.\n\n*Select some text.\n\n*Start scrolling up or down with the mouse wheel.\n\n\nAnd instead of scrolling, it jumps up for a big amount.\n3.5.1 or 3.1.1\nIs it a bug?

It should be temporary problem (probably with your ISP network) if all other devices in your house have this issue.\nTroubleshooting Steps\nMost of these aren't likely to help if you didn't tamper with your Ubuntu installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try changing your DNS to google's DNS servers -> 8.8.8.8. The reasoning being your default ISP DNS can be discarding requests owing to load issues.\n\n*Check if you router has some blocking policies turned on, like specific URL's being blocked.\n\n*Check if you are using some proxy server that is configured to drop requests (seems the most likely issue).\n\n", "Q: Wireless stopped connecting in Ubuntu 14.04 I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Lenovo G50-70 2 days back,and the wireless was working fine.

There is a program running infinitely on remote shell, which doesn't give me access to its login shell.(i.e, Whenever I login I see that program running on the console).\nI wan't send SIGKILL or SIGSTOP or SIGSEGV etc to stop it via ssh.\nIs it possible to send and access the normal shell?\n\nA: If the problem is in /etc/profile, note that, over SSH, it is sourced for interactive shells that SSH itself starts. If you run another command, it is not sourced, even if that command is your shell:\nssh -t user@server bash\n\nWhen a command is specified, SSH assumes you're not running it interactively, and doesn't allocate a pseudo-tty (which can cause problems with some programs). The -t is needed to tell it to allocate a pty anyway.\nAll of this is moot if your SSH server uses a ForceCommand option. If it does, no matter what you specify to the ssh command, whatever the server's configured to run will be run.\n\nA: It sounds like the login shell for your user is non standard.\nHave you tried logging in with ssh user@host /bin/sh?

Investigating the problem I found that the folders where the shares are mounted have weird ownerships. Most of them are owned by the user root and the group root. One of them is owned by my user but then there are strange ones. One has speech-dispatcher as the owner and utempter as the group. Then there's one that's owned by the group 1005 and one that's owned by www-data group.\nThese shares are served from a Ubuntu server and I believe these groups and owners come from there. The ones that I said have root:root owner are currently disconnected from the server. The one that is owned by me is a personal home folder share. Could it be that the server tells my machine the ids of the shares and because they don't map one to one on my machine and the server they are seen as these strange groups and users? And since my computer doesn't have a group with id 1005 it shows as just the number in ls -la?\nHow do I fix this?

This worked partly: Now I can access the share that had root:1005 owner, but the ones with a group or user id which is found locally too don't work.\n\nA: You must define the user and group when you configure the fstab mount for the share if you want to control the user (uid) or group (uid).

I've seen some posts say that you need to change the EFI or Legacy boot settings by at least with my NUC that had no effect.\nHere's two work arounds that I found - perhaps the will help you.\n1) Use the GUI program Boot Repair - This requires you to boot to a working system using a USB stick or CD using Kubuntu or other LiveCD style installer. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair for information. The default or \"Recommended Repair\" doesn't work, but I selected the \"Advanced Options\" and uncheck \"SecureBoot\" but keep all other default options then follow the instructions, the system correctly boots to the newly installed OS. \n2) Install Ubuntu 15.04 first, then upgrade to 15.10. I found that if I install 15.04, run all updates:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nthen run\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nthen 15.10 will successfully boot.\n\nA: According to this, NVMe support didn't land into the linux kernel until version 3.3, and according to distrowatch, 15.04 is still using kernel version 3.19. It looks like you will need to upgrade to 15.10 which uses the 4.2 kernel. \nHowever, in order to boot from the drive, the BIOS also needs to support NVMe, and I'm not sure about NVMe support in the latest Intel BIOS for the NUC. \nI've been thinking about buying this exact equipment combo, so I'm hoping you try this and report back. \n", "Q: Console login not working So I'm having some issues with Ubuntu that require console login.

Or straight to Ubuntu?\n\nA: Whether or not your system boots off of the USB drive or the internal hard drive you just installed Ubuntu onto depends on 2 factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Whether or not the USB drive is still plugged in\n\n*If your BIOS/UEFI boot order has USB drive prioritized above or below the internal hard drive.\n\n\nThe easiest solution would be to just remove the USB drive, and boot up your computer. That will boot up into Ubuntu 14.04, regardless of what drive it is installed on, because it's the only OS available.\nIf you want to change your boot order, there is a function key that you will need to hold down, and that function key is motherboard-specific. Look on the bottom of the screen as you turn on the computer, and it has the computer manufacturer on the screen. On the bottom there will be something like Settings: F7, or similar. Press that button, and you will be taken to your BIOS/UEFI settings.\n\nA: So you've just installed Ubuntu, what now ?\nWhen the installation USB reports to you that the installation process is over and you may reboot the computer, simplest course of action is to shutdown the computer , remove the USB, boot the computer. As explained in zwork's awesome answer ,  chances are that your computer has higher priority for booting USB devices than hard drives, and if it's so , it will check for USB disks plugged in and boot from them if they are present. By default the HDD should have boot priority, but you or someone else may have changed that setting in the bios.\nSo installation media is out, computer is off, and I now boot it up. What may happen?\nThere exists something known as bootloader, the basic program that comes up and allows you to choose from the Operating Systems installed on your disk(s). By default, Ubuntu's bootloader (named GRUB) sets Ubuntu as default option. Again, this is something that you yourself or the person who was installing the OS would have to alter, so you can be sure in 99.99% of the time that it will go to Ubuntu.\nIf it does not boot at all, or there is some error, there's something seriously wrong, and there is need for troubleshooting.\nOK, well what about C and D and other drives ?\nHere's the difference between Ubuntu ( and Linux in general ) and Windows. Under Ubuntu disks are listed as devices, /dev/sda being the main disk. Disks in turn have partitions, chunks where OSs reside. For example, my HDD has /dev/sda2 as Windows 7 partition and /dev/sda5 Ubuntu partition. You will have something similar if you chose \"Install alongside Windows\" option during installation. Linux also uses something known as swap partition - a way to use disk space as extra memory. On my SSD , I only have Ubuntu, so there is /dev/sda1 , but to save disk space I didn't create swap. \nLet's come back to booting part. How do I know that I am booting from the same drive as windows ?\nSimplest way is through command line IMHO, hence showing you that. Open Terminal ( aka command-line, by pressing CtrlAltT together ) and type sudo blkid. If you see multiple lines starting with /dev/sdaX (where X is a number ), and one of the lines says TYPE=\"ntfs\", that means that's your Windows partition. Congrats ! You've installed Ubuntu side-by-side with Windows . If you don't see it, then you either intentionally or unintentionally clicked \"errase the disk and install Ubuntu\" option. Time to either use recovery DVD that came with the computer , save up for new Windows installation DVD, or just stick with Ubuntu and enjoy the ride. \n\nA: If you have chosen \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\", if you pull the USB out out should be able to boot from it with no problem. If you have only one hdd/ssd there is no more C: or D: partitions.\n\nA: Considering that no other OS is present then GRUB should automatically load the available OS which is Ubuntu 14.04 in your case that is it would load Ubuntu when you turn your system 'on'. Moreover here you won't find the nomenclature used in windoes to mark drives i.e C: or D: etc, you will have your boot disk which may look something like /dev/sda 1/ and your other drives would take up the similar system of naming. \n", "Q: How to lock screen 30 minutes after unlock I would like my children to only use the computer for 30 minutes, at which time I would like the screen to be locked.  At that point, if I choose to unlock the screen again, I would like the screen to lock again in another 30 minutes.  \nHow can I write a script to do this?  \n\nA: Run the script below in the background, and it will lock the screen after an arbitrary number of minutes:\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\nt = 0; max_t = int(sys.argv[1])\n\nwhile True:\n    # check runs once per minute\n    time.sleep(60)\n    # check the lock status, add 1 to current time if not locked, else t = 0\n    try:\n        subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"-cf\", \"lockscreen-mode\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n        t = 0\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        t += 1\n    # if unlocked status time exceeds set time (in minutes), lock screen\n    if t >= max_t:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"gnome-screensaver-command\",  \"-l\"])\n        t = 0\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as lock_screen.py \n\n*Test- run it from a terminal with the lock- time as an argument (minutes)\npython3 /path/to/lock_screen.py 30\n\n(Although for the test, I'd take a shorter time)\n\n*If all works fine, add it to Startup Applications Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\npython3 /path/to/lock_screen.py 30\n\n\nA: The script presented bellow starts upon user login and waits certain amount of time before locking the screen. Two caveats must be kept in mind: the script must be part of Startup Applications and it must be executable.\nTime for each session can be configured within the script itself by changing TIME variable, according to /bin/sleep usage. From man sleep:\n\nPause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be 's' for seconds (the\n  default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.\n  Unlike most implementations that require NUMBER be an integer, here NUMBER may be an arbitrary floating  point  number.\n\nThe script can be started manually or as part of Startup Applications to be called upon each GUI login. Refer to  How do I start applications automatically on login? for that.\nSimple Setup\n\n\n*\n\n*Create folder named bin in your personal HOME folder.\n\n*In bin folder create file named sessionLocker.sh. Copy the source code into that file\n\n*Give executable permissions to the file by right clicking on it, go to Properties -> Permissions tab, check \"Allow executing file as program\" option. Alternatively, use chmod +x $HOME/bin/sessionLocker.sh in terminal\n\n*Run Startup Applications. Add full path to script as one of startup applications. Example: /home/MYUSERNAME/bin/sessionLocker.sh\n\n*Restat your Unity session to test.\n\n\nThe script is also posted on my personal github. Use git clone https://github.com/SergKolo/sergrep.git to download the source code. \nScript Source\n#!/bin/bash\n##################################################\n# AUTHOR: Serg Kolo \n# Date: Jan 2nd 2016\n# Description: A script that locks session every x\n#       minutes. \n# TESTED ON: 14.04.3 LTS, Trusty Tahr\n# WRITTEN FOR: https://askubuntu.com/q/715721/295286\n# Depends: qbus, dbus, Unity desktop\n###################################################\n\n# Copyright (c) 2016 Serg Kolo\n#\n# Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n# of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in \n# the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\n# copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of \n# the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, \n# subject to the following conditions:\n#\n# The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all \n# copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n#\n# THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, \n# INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A \n# PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

do is impossible with this setup. Both machines are in different subnets and both machines have a different gateway. This will only work if there's a third device that is part of both subnets and that is capable of routing packets between the both subnets. Otherwise you have to change one of the subnets.\n", "Q: how to proxy specific repo in apt I recently switched to Ubuntu 15.10.\nI need to use a proxy to connect to external internet.And on my local internet there's a repo that doesn't require proxy to connect.\nSo I wrote something like this in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy\nAcquire::http::Proxy::google.com \"http://XXX:8087\";\nAcquire::http::Proxy::spotify.com \"http://XXX:8087\";\n\nUnfortunately,this doesn't work, apt-get update says failed to connect google spotify.\nI also tried change it to this.\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://XXX:8087\";\n\nI can connect to google and spotify now, but I can't connect to my local repo.\n  Isn't there a better workaround?\n\nA: Create a file: /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99proxy and in this file insert the following:\nAcquire::http::Proxy {\n    your.local.repository DIRECT;\n};\n\nThis tells apt to use a direct connection (so not via proxy) to access your local repository.\nChange your.local.repository to the correct location of your local repository.\n", "Q: Cannot revert sound output back after using HDMI[14.04] I used HDMI to my TV with success, outputting both sound and picture.\nAfter unplugging the HDMI from my desktop PC, however the audio persists outputting to \"HDMI / Displayport\", if I toggle +/- for sound.\nHow do I revert it back to the original audio output?\nI have attempted rebooting with the HDMI not plugged in.

I am relatively new to Ubuntu, and I still have much to learn.

Whenever I start a full-screen application or game, for instance CS:GO, and have it running full-screen on my main monitor, upon clicking on the smaller monitor causes the game to minimize, as well as default the mouse's position the center of the main monitor.\nIs there anyway to force the application to remain fullscreen, without running it in full-screen windowed, when performing tasks in another monitor?\n\nA: Add the following line:\nexport SDL_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS=0\n\nto /etc/environment and reboot.\n", "Q: Changing UUID with tune2fs gives \"NOT A DIRECTORY\" ERROR I had a self-inflicted complete failure on my Ubuntu 15.10 partition (/dev/sda5).  I had a complete backup using Systemback, which I installed successfully after booting to the LiveCD.  As happens when I completely reinstall Ubuntu on the partition using either Systemback or tar, the UUID was changed and I get this error:\nNo controller found\nNo caching mode found:\nGave up waiting for root device.....\nAlert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/####-####-#### (i.e., the UUID) does not exist.

I have searched everywhere for the Not a directory while trying to open error in conjunction with tune2fs, and have come up with nothing.  \nAaaarggghh!\n\n\n*\n\n*NOTE: I also tried to update the UUID manually in /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/grub.cfg then chrooting into /dev/sda5 and updating\ngrub -- it didn't work!!\n\n\nA: The trailing slash was the culprit! What a stupid mistake. Thanks so much for catching it. I did also have to change the /etc/fstab UUID, because using tune2fs only changed the partition id, not the fstab.

Like  \necho -e \"Enter your name : \\c\"\n\nBut when we include such kind of statements inside a shell program (.sh file), it produces a mysterious error. It prints \n-e Enter your name : \n\nIt doesn't need that -e option with echo command as if we write like this\necho \"Enter your name : \\c\"\n\nIt shows output with no errors, but that doesn't work in shell.\nSo what is the reason? I am using bash shell and Ubuntu 15.04 version.\n\nA: I guess you haven't used a shebang  (#! /bin/bash as the first line of your script). In that case, the script is run using /bin/sh, which is /bin/dash. And echo in dash doesn't support the non-standard -e (have a look at the POSIX standard). You really shouldn't use echo -e. Use printf instead for far more portable behaviour. See Why is printf better than echo`? on Unix and Linux. The following commands should behave identically:\nbash -c 'printf \"%s\" \"Enter your name\"'\ndash -c 'printf \"%s\" \"Enter your name\"'\n\n", "Q: Finding modules on python Python can't find my modules on the IDE but can find it from the terminal.

Completely deleted Ubuntu 14. However, running a 3GHz with 1 gigabyte of RAM, I'd think Ubuntu would 'fly'. Ubuntu 15 is much slower than Ubuntu 14 was and I wouldn't begin to know why. Any advice?\n\nA: Ubuntu isn't typically very fast with only 1 GB of RAM. As time goes on, it will expect more and more RAM because it's designed for fairly recent computers, and 'fairly recent' changes as time goes on.\nSome alternatives that can handle that much RAM much better are Xubuntu and Lubuntu.\nThey both are officially approved by Canonical (Ubuntu's manufacturer), work fine with all the applications available for Ubuntu, and have exactly the same apt-get and other typical terminal commands.\nInstalling on an existing Ubuntu machine\nOpen a terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T), and type one or both of the following:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nThen, you'd log out, choose to use either Xubuntu (XFCE) or Lubuntu (LXDE), and log in under it.\nInstalling from scratch\nIf you want to install from scratch, make sure you get the 32-bit version of either. It will still work just fine on 64-bit systems, but it uses up even less RAM.\n", "Q: SSD + HDD partitioning I'm currently using Ubuntu 14.04 on a HDD and I recently bought a 120GB SSD. \nI'll make a clean install with / on the SSD, but I'm not sure if I should put /home on the SSD or the HDD. \nI'd like, for instance, to have my steam games installed on the SSD, but I would prefer to have my media files (and other programs) on the HDD. \nIs there a way to achieve this? \n\nA: In the Steam settings, you can manually specify a library location, or you can select a different (or create a different) library when you install a game on a game-by-game basis.\nI would recommend just formatting both as ext4 in the installer, and just do Steam on the SSD.\nEDIT: You could also add /bin and /usr to the SSD, as that will improve performance and speed in both day-to-day operation as well as booting up, as most programs are run out of those directories (mostly /usr).\n", "Q: Weird Files and Folders I have a folder in the Lubuntu which has following structure:\nsoprano (4,2 KB)\n.ecryptfs (26,8 GB) - *this folder was hidden*\nlost+found (16 KB)\n\nInside the folder .ecryptfs:\nsoprano\n\nAnd inside the soprano has:\n.Private (26,8GB)\n.ecryptfs (4,1KB)\n\nInside the folder .Private:\nHas thirty folder, with genre names ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWZvWTNIrxgWSURD and files with genre names ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWZvWTNIrxgWSURD.c6GzJjBSTpPKX0MXUeFVD-aTDzlxJi8CTnZwtWk2U--\nIn turn, folder .ecryptfs has this files\n.wrapped-passphrase.recorded\nwrapped-passphrase\nPrivate.sig\nPrivate.mnt\nauto-umount \nauto-mount\n\nI don't know how this folders and files was created, but I guess this files corresponding the older data which was on pc.

Could anybody explain me?\n\nA: awk splits input record into fields, and uses the Field Separator (FS) to do so. The -F option is used to set FS. When FS is multiple characters long, it is treated as a regular expression.\nIn this case, FS is [ ()+:]+:\n\n\n*\n\n*[...], called a bracket expression, is used to match one of many characters. [ ()+:] means any one of the space, either parenthesis, + or : characters.\n\n*+ after a character or a bracket expression, etc., matches one or more of that character, expression, etc.\n\n\nSo, the pattern means one or more of any of space, either parenthesis, plus or colon.\nSplitting into fields using this expression, you'll see that:\n\n\n*\n\n*) ending the line means the last field is empty\n\n*1+10:31 and 00:02 both split so that the second and third last fields are the hour and minute, since + and : are both used to separate fields.\n\n", "Q: ubuntu compatible macbookpro11.5? my macbook pro 11.5 el capitan is compatible ubuntu ? \nInformations matériel :\nNom du modèle : MacBook Pro\nIdentifiant du modèle : MacBookPro11,5\nNom du processeur : Intel Core i7\nVitesse du processeur : 2,5 GHz\nNombre de processeurs : 1\nNombre total de cœurs : 4\nCache de niveau 2 (par cœur) :  256 Ko\nCache de niveau 3 : 6 Mo\nMémoire :   16 Go\nVersion de la ROM de démarrage :    MBP114.0172.B07\nVersion SMC (système) : 2.30f2\nNuméro de série (système) : C02QM4VEG8WP\nUUID du matériel :  DB224F20-0576-5D22-AC07-3D80CFF14C58\n\nmerci beaucoup \n\nA: Ignoring that you seem to have given up with English after the first sentence, I'll explain a bit about Ubuntu.\nYou should never have to worry whether or not your computer will run it as long as it is a somewhat recent model and contains somewhat well-known hardware\nSince Macs generally have very generic hardware (HPs are almost exactly the same for some reason), they generally work pretty well with Ubuntu. I believe, however, that there is a rather advanced step you need to take, involving the installation of a third-party bootloader (or whatever the name is -- I'm too tired to remember).\nMost people recommend installing rEFInd, but I personally prefer the Clover bootloader, which is very easy to install and supports booting from Mac, Linux and Windows, and even hybrid boots of legacy and EFI. (It's also highly themeable)\nHere's a handy guide to installing Ubuntu using rEFInd. If you want to try out Clover, ignore the instructions involving the rEFInd installation and just install Clover instead.\nTo directly answer your question, yes, your computer should work perfectly fine with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Alain, I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in my macbook pro 11,1 without any issues, but only after doing a few minor tweaks.

I have also  searched in Google for XAMPP Ubuntu install and AskUbuntu XAMPP UI but I only found articles that didn't deal with a UI install solely.\nIs there way to install XAMPP via the UI/GUI ?\n\nA: Open a terminal and use the below command to unpack the downloaded XAMPP file.\nsudo tar xvfz xampp-linux-0.0.0.tar.gz -C /opt\n\nOnce extraction is complete start the service.\nOr\nYou can try GUI control using below commands:\nsudo /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 system requirements I have a Ubuntu 14.04 installed in partition on my laptop.

I have 64 bit version installed but I feel I should have installed 32 bit one. Not sure how do I downgrade it.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 or Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit should run OK on your hardware, so there is no point in reinstalling a 32-bit operating system on your Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop. For more information about system requirements see the accepted answer to How do I find out which version and derivative of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minimal system requirements?.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 14.04 have its own 'Task Manager'? Does Ubuntu 14.04 have its own 'Task Manager'? Like the one in Windows, where you would check what program is using how much and such.\n\nA: You can use top.\nJust open a terminal enter top command and it will show you which process is consuming how much Memory and CPU. Visit the link it will really help you\n12-Top-commands\n\nA: Open 'System Monitor' application ; it's very similar to task manager in Windows.\n\nA: The nice thing about the Task Manager in Windows is that you can use a keyboard shortcut to bring it up, even if the computer is frozen.\nThe System Monitor in Ubuntu is accessible from the Dash: click on the Dash and type “System” and it should come up. This, however, is fairly slow: it involves the graphics-heavy Dash and a search through installed programs and files.\nAs another answer points out, it may be quicker (and more portable to different versions of Ubuntu), to open the System Monitor from the terminal: just type the command gnome-system-monitor. (The Terminal itself can be opened from the Dash, or by the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T.)\nHowever, the best option is to create a new keyboard shortcut. This option is available from System Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts. You’ll want to create a new shortcut with the name System Monitor and the command gnome-system-monitor. The key combination you choose is up to you (I went with Ctrl+Alt+End). Now you’ll be able to launch the System Monitor even when the computer is freezing.\n\nA: use the following command\ngnome-system-monitor\n\nif  not found then run\nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-monitor\n\n", "Q: Disk Partitioning for ubuntu 15.10 to have a NTFS drive I have a 500 GB HDD. I want to install ubuntu 15.10 on it and also want to have an NTFS partition on the drive. What would be the best partitioning scheme for it? \n\nA: Use gparted.  This is available on the Live ubuntu install disk.\nWith this gui application you can create new partitions, resize any existing partitions, or delete partitions and more.\nDecide how big you want your Ubuntu partition to be and how big you want your Windows partition to be.  Also create a swap drive.  Your swap drive should be at least the size of the ram you have in your computer.  You might consider making it 1.5 times amount in case you increase your ram in the future.\nWhen installing your OS'es both Ubuntu and Windows, you will have the option during install to choose the specific partition for the install.\nKeep in mind that in the normal legacy mode a disk can only have 4 primary partitions.  You might consider making one primary partition, then and extended partition.  Under the extended partition you can create as many partitions as you want.  This way you can have partitions for your OS installs, a swap partition and other DATA partitions.\n", "Q: How to prevent graphical applications from being started with sudo I am persuaded that I should never use sudo to start a graphical application. How can I prevent it from ever happening? Getting more sleep might be the correct solution but I want a better one.\n\nA: The problem is not using graphical applications per se, but rather the fact that many graphical applications create (or change the ownership of) dotfiles in the invoking user's home directory, and that sometimes prevents the application from starting again when run as user.\nA possible solution might be to always run sudo with the -H flag:\n-H, --set-home\n            Request that the security policy set the HOME environment\n            variable to the home directory specified by the target user's\n            password database entry.  Depending on the policy, this may\n            be the default behavior.\n\nIf policy allows it (which it does, in current Ubuntu installations, AFAIK) then this will cause applications to write any such data to root's home directory /root instead of the sudoer's home directory.\nA way to achieve that would be using an alias i.e. add alias sudo='sudo -H' to your interactive shell's startup file (e.g. ~/.bashrc).\nI can't think of a situation in which -H would be undesirable in a sudo command, but if there is one then you can invoke the unaliased command as \\sudo somecommand.\nFor a more detailed discussion, including options to preserve $HOME globally via the sudoers file, see How is sudo set to not change $HOME in Ubuntu and how to disable this behavior?\n", "Q: How to completely reinstall linux I was wandering if there is a way i could possibly due to factory reset Linux?\nIf someone could help that would be great.\n\nA: I would delete the partitions associated with Ubuntu (be careful), then run the setup utility again. Or you could just run the utility and choose to override your current installation.\n", "Q: trying to overwrite externaldepsdlg.h which is also in package codeblocks-headers OK I'm kind of confused here.

However, I did not find a solution for my situation.\nWhat I want to achieve: My HDD (Hitachi Travelstar 5k1000) in my notebook should go into standby after ~5min and the load cycle value should only increase moderately.\nMy setup: Ubuntu 14.04 is installed on an SSD and the HDD is only used for data. I checked the APM values for the HDD via sudo hdparm -B /dev/sda and got \n\n/dev/sda:\n   APM_level  = 254\n\nfor AC and for battery\n\n/dev/sda:\n   APM_level  = 128\n\nRight now the HDD never goes into standby mode. However, if my notebook runs on battery, the Load_Cycle_Count increases tremendously (2-3 per minute). \nAs I understand it, an APM level <=127 allows the HDD to go into standy (=spin down?), so APM=128 prevents standby but still increases LCC heavily. What are my options to achieve my goal?\nMaybe related: Up to now I do not use any laptop-mode-tools or TLP etc. If it is useful/helpful I would also appreciate solutions which make use of TLP (for example).\n\nA: This is quite simple with TLP.\nLCC: as a first guess i suggest to configure\nDISK_APM_LEVEL_ON_BAT=192\n\nand monitor LCC afterwards.\nSpindown: configure\n DISK_SPINDOWN_TIMEOUT_ON_AC=\"60 0\"\n DISK_SPINDOWN_TIMEOUT_ON_BAT=\"60 0\"\n\n(assuming HDD is sda)\nIt's all in the TLP FAQ btw.\nps. some more explanation: there is no conflict using APM >= 128 (hdparm -B) and spindown (-S) at the same time (i use it myself). It's however important to always set spindown after (or together with) APM because hdparm -B clears the -S setting. TLP considers this automatically. \n", "Q: When counting lines with wc, don't print an error whenever is a directory I want to count the total number of lines in all /etc files but not the files in the sub directories, so I typed: wc -l /etc/* | tail -1 and the output is like:\nxxxx is a directory \nyyyy is a directory\ntotal 1752\n\nMy question is, how can I rid of (delete) these comments, and is there a better way to do this type of count?\n\nA: Isolate files and run wc on them\nWhat wc -l /etc/* does is that * will expand to all items inside /etc/ directory. Thus the goal is then to isolate files and perform wc on them. There are several ways to do so.\nfor loop with test\nThe test command, or more frequently abbreviated as [ can be used to find whether an item is a regular file like so:\n[ -f \"$FILE\" ]\n\nThus what we can do is iterate over all items in /etc/ and run wc on them if and only if the above command returns true. Like so:\nfor i in /etc/*; do [ -f \"$i\" ] && wc -l \"$i\" ; done             \n\nfind\nWe can also use find with -maxdepth, -type , and -exec flags\nfind /etc/ -maxdepth 1 \\( -type f -o -type l \\) -exec wc -l {} +\n\n\n*\n\n*-maxdepth informs find how deep in the directory structure to go; value of 1 means only the files in the directory we want.\n\n*-type f  tells it to look for regular files, OR (represented by -o flag) for sybolic links  (represented by type l ).  All of that goodness is enclosed into brackets () escaped with \\ so that shell interprets them as part of to find command , rather than something else.\n\n*-exec COMMAND {} + structure here runs whatever command we give it , + indicating to take all the found files and stuff them as command line args to the COMMAND. \n\n\nTo produce total we could pipe output to tail like so\n$ find /etc/ -maxdepth 1 \\( -type f -o -type l \\) -exec wc -l {} + | tail -n 1           \n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \n 11196  total\n\nSide-note\nIt's easier to just use wc -l /etc/* 2>/dev/null | tail -1, as in \nL. D. James's answer, however find should be a part of a habit for dealing with files to avoid processing difficult filenames. For more info on that read the essay How to deal with filenames correctly\n\nA: find does that easily:\nsudo wc -l $(find /etc/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname '*')\n\nOutput:\n...\n828 /etc/mime.types\n25 /etc/ts.conf\n66 /etc/inputrc\n 0 /etc/subgid-\n8169 total\n\nBUT if you just want the number as output and nothing else:\nsudo wc -l $(find /etc/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname '*') | grep total | awk '{print $1}'\n\nEDIT: newlines error kos said prevails. Only using -exec rectifies it. Also, /etc doesn't contain such files.\nOutput:\n8169\n\nAs pointed by kos, the above command can be reduced to:\nsudo wc -l $(find /etc/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname '*') | awk 'END {print $1}'\n\nEDIT: newlines error kos said prevails. Only using -exec rectifies it. Also, /etc doesn't contain such files.\nOutput:\n8169\n\n\nA: Using z-shell (zsh), the queen of the shells, instead of bash.\nsudo wc -l /etc/*(.) | tail -1\n\n\nA: You can output the error messages to /dev/null\n$ wc -l /etc/* 2>/dev/null | tail -1\n\nWith this command you are only seeing the number of lines in the files that are world readable.  To see the number of lines of all the files you would have to elevated the command with sudo.\n$ sudo wc -l /etc/* 2>/dev/null | tail -1\n\n", "Q: Virtualbox Windows 10 Guest installation is freezing up in 14.04 I've installed VirtualBox using the Software Centre and I'm running a system on Ubuntu 14.04 with 8gb RAM, 64-bit dual core processor.\nI want to run Windows 10, I've tried both 64 and 32 bit versions, in virtualbox.

My computer's gone mad to a point it is hardly usable (though I am somehow writing this now). There are numerous symptoms, including the mouse cursor keeping disappearing and reappearing, window appearance keeping changing (font size, positioning of elements inside the window, the menu bar appearing and disappearing under the title bar - this is for all windows, not for a particular program), slow reaction time (or at least no immediate visible reaction part of the time, perhaps correlated with appearance changes), system not reacting to my keyboard shortcuts and some programs failing to open (including the keyboard layout selector, system monitor and some - though not all - of the system settings). Also, when I type fast sometimes the letters get mangled.\nIf anyone knows what's causing this and/or what would solve it I'll be very grateful. One clue I have is that running ps I saw dozens (or even hundreds) of instances of /usr/lib/unity-settings-daemon/usd-locate-pointer. Maybe this holds the key to the mystery?\nI'm using Ubuntu 15.10 with Unity.\n\nA: Well, I've found out what the problem was, and I'll describe it here in case someone else gets here having similar issues.\nSomething was preventing unity-settings-daemon (hereinafter usd) from operating properly. In my case this something was indicator-keyboard (hereinafter indkbd) which failed to load because of some reason I still don't quite understand, but it has something to do with me adding a new keyboard layout (why it caused it to crash – and without as little as an error message too! – is beyond me). And apparently, indkbd crashing caused usd to crash as well (again, without an explanation of the cause).\nI don't know which process runs usd, but it seems it kept launching it again and again. This was responsible for much of the weird behaviour I was witnessing (like the constant fluctuation between two themes and the constant disappearing and reappearing of the mouse cursor). Also, anything that usd takes care of after indkbd was not taken care of, which explains why some other things were not working.\nI managed to find where the problem was by running dmesg and examining the segfault's: they were from uncountable usd processes, plus a couple of indkbd's – which made me suspect indkbd was not loading properly, which was indeed solved after restoring my keyboard layout list (/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml).\nThe titular usd-locate-pointer seems to be responsible for attracting visual attention to the mouse cursor upon hitting Ctrl. It probably has nothing to do with the problem I had, it's just that more and more instances of it were launched by usd as the latter was constantly relaunched (which burdened my system even more).\n", "Q: Can't connect VPN with OpenVPN on Network Manager Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I would like to connect to my new VPN (HMA) with openVPN and Network Manager on Ubuntu 14.04LTS.

You need to treat the partition as if it is a USB drive, so it may be hard to find a program that'll burn the ISO to it. It should work fine if you extract the installer ISO and copy the files to the partition. Make the partition NTFS or FAT32. If you have EFI, then use the BIOS EFI boot menu to select the partition as the boot source. If you can, disable Secure Boot in the BIOS.\nI have done this before, and I think it was with Ubuntu, but I also had a third party bootloader, since I was also doing Hackintosh at the time. I don't remember whether or not I tried the built in selector to boot from the partition installer I made.

You don't need to reinstall. Even if you have the normal Ubuntu 14.04 now, you can install MATE over what you have.\nTo upgrade from an LTS release (I'm assuming you're using 14.04 and not 14.10), you need to let Ubuntu check for any new release to upgrade to instead of just LTS releases. Open the Update Manager app by searching for it. Once that opens, click the Settings... button in the bottom left corner. Go to the Updates tab and change Notify me of a new Ubuntu version: from For long-term support versions to For any new version. Now, press the Close button and put in your password.\nBack in the Update Manager app, press the Check button and let it check for new updates. Once that finishes, press Install Updates, put in your password, and let the updates install. You may need to reboot. If that is the case, do it and open the Update Manager app again.\nNow, press the Upgrade button near the top right, next to the message saying \"New Ubuntu release '**.**' is available\". Your computer should start the upgrade to 15.10. There are some menus you will have to click through during the upgrade process, so don't start it and leave.\nIf you need images, here is a guide for upgrading 12.04 to 12.10. The steps should still apply: https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-12.04-lts-precise-pangolin-to-12.10-quantal-quetzal-desktop-and-server\nNow, once you are in 15.10, you need to install the MATE desktop environment, assuming you're not currently using MATE. To do that, open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and run sudo apt-get install mate-desktop-environment.\nAfter this, you should be done, and using 15.10 MATE.\n\nIf you still want to go the USB method:\nIt sounds like you're in the BIOS setup, trying to change the boot priority and put the USB stick first. That is unnecessary. Instead, you can just press the key to get into the boot menu and select the USB stick from there. Since you didn't provide much about even which version of Ubuntu you want, I can't tell you what that key is.

For a special task I have a root server running Linux Ubuntu 14.04. The server has a very minimalistic installation with ssh on a non-standard port and no root access. \nBasically the servers primary purpose is to collect and process large amounts of data coming from a number of clients. There is only one single application with a TCP listener handling the client requests.\nLast year I've been using iptables and I noticed in my logs many ICMP, DoS and DDoS attacks to my servers ip address. Some of these attacks caused a lot of unwanted traffic. I can see this in the traffic reports I get from my hosting provider. In one case, due to the unusual traffic, my ISP even blocked the access to my server.\nAs I didn't know how to resolve the issue I temporarilly deactivated iptables and to my big surprise, my traffic statistics went back to normal! Now I'm asking myself what was wrong? Is it even better to have no iptables installed, because I have only 2 ports open to the Internet at all? How can iptables contribute to the protection of my server in this case?\n\nA: Iptables is a firewall which allows you to keep open the nonstandard port n for SSH access and block any connection attempt on any other port.  If you disable iptables, you make possible for attackers to try an exploit to any other port and possibly do something malicious to your server (due to a service that you forgot stopping, a bug, or similar).  So yes, you must keep it on and configured to open only the ports you need. \nThere is no correlation between the attacks stopping and you disabling iptables -- it was purely by chance.  Either that, or perhaps iptables was misconfigured.\n\nA: It seems as if the iptables were configured incorrectly.\nMany sites on the internet show iptables rules which restrict the ICMP very strongly or totally block it. Only on the example of ICMP, which has a seemingly very bad reputation. Try to adapt your rules to network requirements, even if it takes some time.\n\nA: Let's first look at one of your comments:\n\nLast year I've been using iptables and I noticed in my logs many ICMP, DoS and DDoS attacks to my servers ip address. Some of these attacks caused a lot of unwanted traffic.\n\nFirst one to tackle: DDoS.  There's nothing you can do at the server/firewall level to protect against a DDoS.  These're designed to target and overload your entire network pipe, and only the ISPs, really, have any methods to 'filter' out DDoSes.  Most times you have to pay for it (and 99% of residential class connections don't have the option).\nSecondly, ICMP and DoS.  ICMP is a very common packet type; it's not necessarily an attack as most of your standard traffic interprets ICMP packets too.  You are likely looking to ratelimit these, rather than outright block them.  DoS is similar, but are going to be attacking your specific software on your system/server to exploit and crash it.\n\nNow onto whether iptables is at fault.  It most certainly is not.  It doesn't generate any of the traffic you've indicated; when configured it will tell you about that traffic via log and then drop rules, but it will ultimately not be generating that traffic.\n\niptables is a firewall - not a comprehensive solution for protecting your server or network from attacks.  It's designed to allow you to have some level of control over what can or cannot connect to your server, what you wish to block automatically given certain criterion, what you wish to block, etc.  It's not going to protect against DoS, and certainly not DDoS.\niptables being on or off won't change traffic coming towards your network - what you're seeing is more or less a coincidence, because someone's trying to access your server and is just trying again anyways when they fail.  Your ISP is likely not blocking the connections based on your iptables rules, and are likely instead dropping based on the incoming traffic to your system; this is something you would have to talk to the ISP about.\n", "Q: Trying to change the nameservers, I am stuck by the complexity I found I am trying to change the nameservers being used by my Ubuntu machine (just my laptop, not a server).\nIn the good old days in which I was using Slackware I just needed to edit /etc/resolv.conf and my job was done.\nAfter figuring out that /etc/resolv.conf is actually generated by resolvconf I edited /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head as such:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nBut my job is not done. I see that an unwanted line is still added in /etc/resolv.conf:\nnameserver 127.0.1.1\n\nI don't like this because I want the name resolution to fail just after trying Google's nameservers.\nThis line isn't in any file in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/ and here my confusion begins. By sudo netstat -ltnp I see that I have a name server daemon running on my laptop:\ntcp        0      0 127.0.1.1:53            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4889/dnsmasq    \n\nWhy would I need that? I cannot remove the package containing dnsmasq (which is dnsmasq-base) because these packages depend on it:\n  checkbox-gui checkbox-qt dnsmasq-base network-manager network-manager-gnome plainbox-provider-checkbox plainbox-provider-resource-generic ubuntu-desktop\n\nIs this service running on port 53 really necessary to the well-being of my machine? How can I prevent it from running without using GUI tools and without compromising NetworkManager?\nAttempt to a solution\nTried altering /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and restarting NetworkManager by commenting the line referring to dnsmasq\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\n#dns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nThe aforementioned unwanted line in resolv.conf did indeed disappear. But, unfortunately it seems to be replaced to this line: \nnameserver 192.168.0.1\n\nWould be nice to have some elucidation on the meaning and purpose of such behavior.\nA temporary fix is to remove the link /etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf and creating a new /etc/resolv.conf file from scratch. This would work.. somewhat. It would not add other useful name informations (such as the search directives) that come from the DHCP.\nSo, a definitive solution that allows resolv.conf to be generated by resolvconf or NetworkManager still needs to be found.\n\nA: First of all, you generally don't need to edit files in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/ in order to obtain the desired behavior. Editing those files should be regarded as a temporary hack. Generally you want to configure your interface configurer (in your case NetworkManager) to behave the way you want.\nTo remove nameserver 127.0.1.1 you did the right thing, you commented out dns=dnsmasq in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. That prevents NetworkManager from starting a local forwarding nameserver (a dnsmasq instance) which listens at IP address 127.0.1.1. When that address is not registered with resolvconf, resolvconf exposes other nameserver addresses in /etc/resolv.conf that have been provided to it. The address 192.168.0.1 that appears in your resolv.conf must come either from one of the files in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/ or from an interface configurer which sends nameserver information to resolvconf. You are using NetworkManager so what you want to do is to configure NetworkManager not to use (i.e., not to forward to resolvconf) any nameserver addresses that it receives from the DHCP server. The configuration dns=none (suggested by Serg) would do this. However, the more conventional thing to do is to leave /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head alone (i.e., with just the warning comment) and to use NetworkManager's connection editor to select Method: Automatic (DHCP) addresses only and the desired addresses (in your case, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) in the Additional DNS servers field on the IPv4 Settings tab.\n\nA: The rationale behind the introduction of dnsmasq as a local DNS relay is stated here in a blogpost by Stéphane  Graber.\nCiting the main reason:\n\nThis was done to better support split DNS for VPN users and to better\n  handle DNS failures and fallbacks. This dnsmasq server isn’t a caching\n  server for security reason to avoid risks related to local cache\n  poisoning and users eavesdropping on other’s DNS queries on a\n  multi-user system.\nThe big advantage is that if you connect to a VPN, instead of having\n  all your DNS traffic be routed through the VPN like in the past,\n  you’ll instead only send DNS queries related to the subnet and domains\n  announced by that VPN. This is especially interesting for high latency\n  VPN links where everything would be slowed down in the past.\n\nYou'll also find many comments following !\n", "Q: Problems encountered when installing Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 8 I was trying to install linux Ubuntu version 12.04 alongside Windows 8 on my Toshiba Satellite but when I restart I can't find the place to switch between the windows and Ubuntu.

You can either install the VirtualBox Guest Additions using the official Ubuntu package (what I recommend), or you can install the kernel headers and try again. I'm going to provide directions for installing the package. Since the VirtualBox Guest Additions have already been packaged, building them from source yourself is just wasted effort.\nAnyway, make sure you have all of the standard repositories for Ubuntu 15.10 enabled in your guest, and then run sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms linux-headers-generic. This will install the VirtualBox Guest Additions using DKMS, which means that the modules will automatically be rebuilt whenever you get a kernel upgrade.\n", "Q: Are any other systems' manpages available on Ubuntu?

Implementation of -m on FreeBSD concerns the machine architecture, not operating system.\nTo answer your question's title, at least GNU/kFreeBSD manpages are available, but not using the documented method of viewing them.\n(As an aside, initial commit to NewOS repository is from 2000, but initial commit to GNU man-db man(1) source shows a copyright from 1995 along with a reference to NewOS, as does the most recent version of man-db in Debian bo.

But since this flag was on the root partition and thus was not visible in the first tier of partitions (an NTFS, another NTFS, a block of EXT4s and another NTFS), the system was giving a \"Boot device not found\" error.  \nSolution:\nThe following set of step helped me solve this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a LiveCD of Ubuntu on a USB drive/CD\n\n*Boot from that drive and select Try Ubuntu\n\n*Use gparted to change the flag of the whole block of EXT4 partitions (or whole ubuntu partition; shaded as grey in the figure) to boot, this will make sure that a drive with a boot flag is visible in the very first tier of partitions\n\n\n\n", "Q: Working with screen sessions in LXD-managed containers I have been trying to attach and detach screen sessions in LXD-managed containers; initially, I wasn't able to even start one, but that problem was answered here.\nHowever, being able to start a session, then detach it, isn't sufficient. To work with screen sessions, one must be able to re-attach to a certain session.\nI can initiate a session with\nlxc exec my-ubuntu -- sh -c \"exec >/dev/tty 2>/dev/tty </dev/tty && /usr/bin/screen -s /bin/bash\"\n\nbut then, when I issue\nlxc exec my-ubuntu -- sh -c \"exec >/dev/tty 2>/dev/tty </dev/tty && /usr/bin/screen -x\"\n\neither nothing at all happens (I just get another command line) or, if I've issued the first command more than once, I get There are several suitable screens on: followed by a list of sessions, and a suggestion to re-attach to them with \"screen [-d] -r [pid.]tty.host\". However, that also fails silently. I've also tried to issue\nlxc exec my-ubuntu -- sh -c \"exec >/dev/tty 2>/dev/tty </dev/tty && /bin/bash\"\n\nand then screen -x from the resulting terminal, to no avail.\nWhat can I do?\nEDIT:\nIf I use the last command to get a terminal inside my container my-ubuntu, I can initiate screen sessions just typing screen, and detach them with CTRL-a followed by d. However, screen -x then fails silently just as described above, and if I try CTRL-a followed by n from within a session, it reports no other window.\n\nA: I suggest:-\nlxc exec <container> --mode=interactive -- bash\n\n", "Q: How do I fully configure Cinnamon? I've installed Cinnamon over LXDE in Ubuntu 15.10, and I removed everything LXDE-related. \nWhen the computer wakes from sleep (i.e, when I close and reopen the lid), I enter my password (into a non-Cinnamon unlocker) to unlock it, and the Cinnamon panel has vanished. \nAs far as I can tell, Cinnamon is configured properly, and comes back after a reboot, but as soon as I sleep the PC again, it vanishes. My desklets stay working, as do some other Cinnamon extensions, just the panel vanishes.\nI could run cinnamon --replace but that would not honour my user's configurations, nor is it what I want to have to do every wakeup.\nAm I missing a package?

It has a Intel N3540 CPU and a integrated Intel HD Graphics GPU. It has a UEFI and I ran dualboot Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10. Under Windows no problems, but I prefer Ubuntu... While just working and surfing it runs, but when I look at videos (mp4) it takes sometimes only seconds sometimes minutes until the machine full freezes, no keyboard and no ssh access to it. So also no logfiles from the crashes exist. I still tried to change the GPU frequency with intel_gpu_frequency from the lowest to highest value, already switched off bluetooth, but no change... I also still tried the latest evaluation version of Ubuntu with the 4.3 kernel and the 01.org intel drivers but also no change. Does anybody know what to do? I think more people have those freezing problem, is there a programmer who wants to find out and fix this for the next version?\n\nA: I have an issue that sounds pretty similar also on an N3540 CPU. I'm pretty sure this kernel bug may be the culprit, as the identified workaround fixed the problem for me. \nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109051\nLooks like it has something to do with the Baytrail CPUs changing to a different c-state (idle power state). The consensus seems to be that a workaround is limiting the c-state to a max of 1 by setting the kernel parameter intel_idle.max_cstate=1. Presumably, with a cost of less power savings when your machine is idle. \nInstructions for setting kernel parameters:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters\n", "Q: Boot from USB: BIOS proceed to Grub 2 Using Grub 2 back in the days, I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a dual-boot way with my existing Windows 7 installation.

I've tried several suggestions that I've found both here and in other forums.\n# Clean + -f install #\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get -f install\n# Output: 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove, and 0 not upgraded.\n\nI've also tried removing the repository and adding it again with no luck. I tried purging the repository then adding it again as suggested by this post and now terminal won't even find the package, much less try to install. I also tried installing aptitude as I've read that it may be able to install packages somewhat forcibly (also failed, because I also get unmet dependencies when trying to install aptitude). Lastly I also get unmet dependencies when trying to install gimp, which leads me to believe it might be a system problem instead of a package/dependency problem, so I went so far as to re-install the system from scratch with no luck. So far the only things I managed to install in the system are the firmware-b43-installer for the wireless (Broadcom BCM4312) card and ubuntu-restricted-extras.\nSo now, I'm looking for solutions that I haven't tried yet or something I might have missed. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Okay, I don't know if this qualifies as an answer, but I re-installed the system one more time and third time was the charm. Pipelight installed this time. I still don't know why it didn't install before, but the problem got solved anyway, so thanks to everyone who at least took a look at this question.

I personally don't think it's a nice and clean solution, but it should be able to do the job. What this solution does is the following:\nInstead of directly starting the program in the container, there is a two-step launch going on: First, a small script is launched with docker, which basically creates a new user in the container, and then executes the main program as this new user.

I want to be able to boot to it like a normal Ubuntu installation and be able to do system upgrades, etc.\nI've seen suggestions to use tools like rEFInd, but I'm not wanting to mess with my Mac's EFI or primary drive. Since the Live USB boots just fine with no modifications (by holding option on boot and selecting it), it seems like it should be possible to boot a full installation the same way.\nOr am I doing something that doesn't make sense or is impossible? If it helps, this is a 15\" MacBook Pro Retina (Mid 2015) and I'm using a USB 3.0 drive that claims 180MB/s reads and 50MB/s writes. \n\nA: First, you MUST understand the differences between two boot modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI -- This is the Mac's native boot mode. To boot in EFI mode, you need a boot loader on an EFI System Partition (ESP) called EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi (or EFI/BOOT/bootia32.efi for older Macs with 32-bit EFIs). (Macs can also boot from HFS+ volumes, but I'm not sure of the rules for booting them from external disks using HFS+.) Ordinarily, the boot loader for Ubuntu will be GRUB 2, but it could be something else, including ELILO, rEFInd, gummiboot, or even a Linux kernel. Note that it's far easier to boot in the EFI's native bit depth than otherwise in EFI mode -- that is, if your EFI is 64-bit, you should install a 64-bit Ubuntu. In theory, if you've got a 32-bit EFI, you should install a 32-bit Ubuntu; but Ubuntu's 32-bit images provide no EFI support, so you'll have to jump through significant additional hoops to do this.\n\n*BIOS -- Apple's EFIs include a BIOS compatibility layer, aka a Compatibility Support Module (CSM) or legacy boot support. If you prepare a disk with a BIOS-mode boot loader in the disk's MBR (and follow-on locations), it should be bootable by the Mac. Ubuntu sets up GRUB 2 as its default BIOS-mode boot loader, but you could use something else if you prefer, such as LILO or GRUB Legacy. If you've got a 32-bit EFI, a BIOS-mode install is likely to be simpler.\n\n\nIt's unclear which way you tried to set up your system, or if you even know which way you tried. Ordinarily, the Ubuntu installer will attempt to install a boot loader that matches the way it booted -- that is, it sets up an EFI-mode boot loader if it booted in EFI mode and a BIOS-mode boot loader if it booted in BIOS mode. Unfortunately, the installer's boot mode is not always obvious. The easiest way is to drop to a shell and look for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've probably booted in BIOS mode. Controlling the boot mode can be tricky. The Mac's built-in boot manager might present two boot options for the installer, but the installer must also be prepared properly for the desired boot mode. You may need to experiment with multiple tools for preparing the installation medium to get the thing to boot the way you want.\nFurthermore, tweaking the boot loader installation for an external medium can be tricky, especially in EFI mode. If you want to do an EFI-mode installation, your best bet is to launch the installer in \"try without installing\" mode and then type ubiquity -b. This will cause the installation to proceed without installing a boot loader. You can then install a boot loader manually to the external disk's ESP, using the filename EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi (or bootia32.efi). This will require considerable knowledge of your boot loader to configure it, though. The easiest to configure is likely to be rEFInd. I know you said you don't want to use it, but you can install to the external disk and even configure it to hide its menu so you don't see it.\nA BIOS-mode installation is likely to be easier to set up; you mainly need to be careful to tell the installer to put GRUB on the external disk (probably /dev/sdb) rather than the internal disk. The risk here is that the external disk might not be bootable because Macs are pretty finicky about booting external media, especially in BIOS mode.\n", "Q: How to ssh into a server running on a home network, behind a router? Okay, so I have a PC in my home network, running Ubuntu on a VM with openssh server installed. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I remotely access it from another computer outside the home network, using the internet?\n\n*What IP address do I use to connect to it?\n\n*What kind of port-forwarding do I need to do?\n\n\nA: My personal setup is the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*On the router forward port 22 from remote machine to 2222 of the local machine, let's say 192.168.0.33 for example. That way you can still have ssh access to the main OS on the machine, while 2222 is for the virtual OS.\n\n\n\n*On the virtual box, forward host OS 192.168.0.33 port 2222 to the guest OS's port 22. The IP of the guest can be found with the ifconfig command on the guest itself.\n\n\n\nNow if you know your router's IP, you can ssh to your router's IP, and it will be automatically forwarded to port 2222 of your physical machine. Physical machine will give that connection to port 22 of virtual machine (provided that VM is running). \nIf you want to ssh from local network, use ssh -p 222 192.168.0.33\n\nA: There are multiple things you need to do:\n1) Like fkraiem mentioned in his comment, make sure your VM is accessible on the local network. Using a 'bridge' network connection in the VM settings should accomplish that. Then using one of your other computers (even your host), check to see if you can log into the SSH server. If you can, congrats, let's move to the next step.\n2) Next you need to know how to port forward on your router. Since you didn't mention what router you have, you will have to figure that out yourself. Port 22 is the one used by SSH. Of course you can listen on a higher port on the router to avoid having your logs filled up by a bunch of script kiddies trying to hack into your server, and then forward the port to 22 on your server. For example, lets imagine your local IP for your server is 192.168.0.10. Your WAN (Internet) IP is 99.99.99.99.\n99.99.99.99:60022 -> Router -> 192.168.0.10:22\nWhat you want to do is tell your router to listen on port 60022, and forward that to IP 192.168.0.10, and port 22.\nTo figure out what your WAN IP is, simply google 'what is my IP address'. There are other ways, but it is the easiest.\nNow, after you setup the router, try to connect with an outside computer to your WAN IP with the higher port. You could tether with your cellphone to a laptop to accomplish that. \nIf you could connect with that, congrats again.  \n3) Now you have to make sure your IP addresses stay static on your local network, and you would need to get a dynamic DNS entry for your WAN IP address. This way you would use a domain name instead of your WAN IP. Google 'dynamic dns' to find some free service.\nHope that helped. \n\nA: ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) has worked well for me for this purpose. After install it's simply:\n./ngrok tcp 22\n\nwhich will start an ngrok session and display a tcp address and a port which you can then ssh to:\nssh username@address -p port\n\nThis will not require any port forwarding or changes in router config, as it is a reverse tunnel. However, the free version does not provide static addresses/IPs.\n", "Q: What music streaming services work on Ubuntu?

This is usually solved by checking the proper \"Additional Drivers\" installation and/or setting up the proper Graphics Resolution (Please have in mind that some GPU's won't be able to \"draw\" fast on certain screen resolutions, and reducing the screen size will help a lot).\n\n*Your Hard Disk Drive speed: Which is -nowadays- the cause of the majority of the slowness in modern equipment. Remember that the delays on your hard disk drive read/write rates will result in a slower performance.\n\n*Among other drivers/hardware based issues...\n\n\nBut, if you wish to have the benefits of working with Linux and more specifically Ubuntu, in a low resources computer, please have in consideration the next list of advices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Please consider using the 32 bits version of the regular Ubuntu LTS\n\n*Using Ubuntu \"out of the box\" may result in a nightmare if your computer is not ready to perform Graphical Accelerated Tasks, such as 3D rendering, smoothing in the on-screen effects, overlay, etc. So, the usage of a different Desktop Environment or Window Manager will represent a major benefit to your computer's OS. Personally I use the i3WM in a low resources computer such as a Compaq Mini CQ10 and an Acer Aspire One ZG5. But you can also use the KUbuntu Desktop (KDE) in which against all odds, you'll have a faster experience when working on the majority of the applications and/or browsing your files and the web.\n\n*Remember there are lots of different desktop environments which will represent a major benefit for your experience, but don't forget to adjust your screen resolution in order to lease the pain on your graphics processing unit (GPU) thus releasing resources which can be used for a different purpose on your system.\n\n\nThat's where I would start and I suggest you to try these advices and let us know about your experiences on this.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working on Ubuntu 15.10 with BCM43142 update:\n$ lsusb\nBus 003 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp. \nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 04f2:b3aa Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd \nBus 001 Device 002: ID 0489:e062 Foxconn / Hon Hai \n\nI cannot get the same Bluetooth message in terminal as Bluetooth Broadcom 43142 isn't working \nThe Raw Question:\nI'm a newbie for Ubuntu.

However, when running a CMake job where the destination is on the share, the job hangs or goes very slowly, and files do not get written to disk.  The smbnetfs.log file reads:\n2016-01-02 17:44:16.758 srv(1942)->smb_conn_srv_read: errno=13, Permission denied\n2016-01-02 17:44:18.779 srv(1943)->smb_conn_srv_read: errno=13, Permission denied\n2016-01-02 17:44:18.801 srv(1944)->smb_conn_srv_read: errno=13, Permission denied\n2016-01-02 17:44:20.822 srv(1945)->smb_conn_srv_read: errno=13, Permission denied\n2016-01-02 17:44:22.838 srv(1946)->smb_conn_srv_read: errno=13, Permission denied\n\nI also saw entries in the log file related to CMakeError.log, but no log file was ever written.

For both techniques there are plenty of budget solutions coming with sender or receiver modules ready to plug in to our existing systems. In case our sender is already equipped with a Bluetooth module we will only need a single additional BT-module on the receiver side. This will be the most lightweight or least expensive solution.\nAudio streaming through our local wireless network\nTo be able to stream audio to any audio receiver we need a device capable of connecting the audio receiver to our wireless network. It may be best to look for devices we already own to keep costs low. The receiveing device could be anything from:\n\n*\n\n*a network-capable Smart-TV or BluRay/DVD-PLayer.\n\n*an outdated tablet-PC or smartphone.\n\n*a gaming console such as the XBox 360 you had mentioned.\n\n*an old first-generation Airport Express module.\n\n*a spare laptop or old computer capable of running a lightweight Ubuntu distribution.\n\n*a dedicated HTPC-box which could range from a RaspberryPi to a small factor mini-PC (e.g. NUC).\n\nReceiving the audio streams through the wireless network\nDepending on the hardware we chose we again have a choice of streaming methods depending on what the receiver supports.\n\n*\n\n*Smart-TVs or an XBox can be attached as a DLNA renderer.\n\n*If possible we may receive our private Internet Radio we had created.\n\n*In case we run Ubuntu on the receiver side we can just use pulseaudio network streams.\n\n*Running xbmc/Kodi (or any other home theater application) on the receiver side lets us chose from several streaming methods including Internet Radio, Pulseaudio, or DLNA.\n\n", "Q: sed Error with Cordova for Ubuntu Touch i've run into an sed error while trying to build an app for ubuntu touch.\nhttp://pastebin.com/uj1VnhFu\nFor some weird reason cordova still uses 14.10 framework as default.

I noticed that some python scripts start with\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\ninstead of\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nAre python scripts the only ones that use #!/usr/bin/env? Are there any scripts that start out with for example #!/usr/bin/env bash or #!/usr/bin/env perl? If not then why are python scripts different?\n\nA: In addition to the answers given above, the use of /usr/bin/env allows your Python to be installed in non-standard places, and as long as your PATH is set-up correctly, the script will run unmodified on any UNIX-style system that has /usr/bin/env. This includes any modern version of Linux and OS/X.\n\nA: Using env in the shebang of a script\nPython scripts are not different from scripts in any other language on this.\nEither the usage of #!/usr/bin/env python or #!/usr/bin/python plays a role if the script is executable, and called without the preceding language. The script then calls the language's interpreter to run the code inside the script, and the shebang is the \"guide\" to find, in your example, python.\nUsing #!/usr/bin/env python instead of the absolute (full path) #!/usr/bin/python makes sure python (or any other language's interpreter) is found, in case it might not be in exactly the same location across different Linux- or Unix -like distributions, as explained e.g. here.\nAlthough #!/usr/bin/python will work on a default Ubuntu system, it is therefore good practice to use  #!/usr/bin/env python instead.\nAbout env\nenv is an executable in /usr/bin, or, as mentioned by @hvd (thanks for the hint!), available as a compatibility symlink in /usr/bin to env, in pretty much all Linux distributions.\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nenv is a shell command for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to either print a list of environment variables or run another utility in an altered environment without having to modify the currently existing environment. Using env, variables may be added or removed, and existing variables may be changed by assigning new values to them.\nand in relation to your question:\nIn practice, env has another common use. It is often used by shell scripts to launch the correct interpreter. In this usage, the environment is typically not changed\n\nMore on env is to be found here, and, as always, in man env (from a terminal).\n\nAdditional information on the shebang; why doesn't #!python work?\nIn a comment, it was asked why we cannot simply use #!python as a shebang. Since the interpreter is in $PATH, the idea is understandable.\nThe reason is that an executable is executed by execve, as we can read here. Specifically the lines:\nAn interpreter script is a text file that has execute permission enabled and whose first line is of the form:\n#! interpreter [optional-arg]\nThe interpreter must be a valid pathname for an executable....\nexplain that execve demands a full (valid) path to the interpreter. That makes sense, since scripts (in any language) can e.g. be run at any moment during startup as well, possibly before $PATH is set at all.\n\nA: Jacob's answer explains it well. However there is one more point I would like to mention.\nUsing /usr/bin/env/ in python serves one more purpose. As python supports virtual environments, using /usr/bin/env python will make sure that your scripts runs inside the virtual environment, if you are inside one.\nWhereas, /usr/bin/python will run outside the virtual environment.\n", "Q: Cannot mount cdrom drive I cannot mount cdrom drive on xubuntu 14.04.

If you have an iso image of windows, you can make bootable cd by copying image directly or you can make a bootable usb using Rufus. If you dont have an iso image, you can download a free trial Here. But it is only a trial for limited time.\n", "Q: \"crepitation\" when viewing videos on facebook with Firefox Problem only occurs when I try to view videos on my facebook wall in Firefox. There is no sound for the video, only a very loud \"crepitation\". Using Ubuntu 14.  \nI already tired to reinstall pulseaudio, didn't helped. I tried to clear the cache/cookies/history in Firefox, didn't helped. I tried to reboot the notebook, didn't help. \nQuestion: how can I fix this? Or the solution is to clean install a fresh Ubuntu 15?\n\nA: Search google for\nstatic noise facebook firefox\n\nand you can find that facebook made a new proprietary video serving method, that is only supported in Ubuntu 15 (at least it works on it)\n", "Q: How to uninstall OS from dual boot system? I have HDDs with different configurations of Windows and Ubuntu versions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7\n\n*Ubuntu 15.10 and Windows 8\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 10\n...\n\n\nI would like to uninstall Windows from some discs. \nI have also other OSs in some discs so it would be great if there exists some generic approach which leaves only one OS in the system i.e. Ubuntu. \nAt the moment, I have replaced such systems by installing a fresh OS on top of them but it is inefficient because I lose everything there. \nI would like to maintain their content. \nHow can you uninstall Windows in some discs?\n\nA: Download GParted\n\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nFrom your Ubuntu delete or format the partitions on which your particular Windows is installed. (Every disk is shown by a letter. You have sda, sdb and sdc.)\nAfter removing your Windows from the disks update your Grub\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nThat is it!\n\nA: If you wanted to keep Windows only, you could do something similar with EasyBCD updating your boot information.  Below is a link for configuring a dual boot with Windows and Ubuntu:\nhttps://neosmart.net/wiki/easybcd/dual-boot/linux/ubuntu/\n", "Q: Worse gaming performance after downgrading to 14.04 LTS? I was previously using Xubuntu 15.10, but I decided that I wanted to switch to LTS releases, so I reinstalled Xubuntu using a bootable USB with 14.04 on it. Everything worked fine and I installed the latest Nvidia drivers (352.63) but upon playing Saints Row 4 and Dead Island, I noticed a significant decrease in performance. \nSaints Row 4 wasn't playable at all, with ~20 FPS. My previous installation ran at ~40-60 FPS with the same exact settings. Dead Island is still playable at 30-40 FPS, but 15.10 ran it at 40-60 FPS.\nIs this normal behavior, or did something go wrong with my installation?\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPU: Zotac GTX 950 AMP Edition\n\n*CPU: AMD A10-6800k\n\n*RAM: 8GB\n\n*OS: Xubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\n\n\nA: I realized that 352.63 wasn't the latest driver and upgrading to version 358 fixed the problem. 3 days of low frame rates for this...\nHow I updated the driver:\nFirst I added Nvidia's proprietary driver PPA and updated sources:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\nThen I went into Settings > \"Additional Drivers,\" selected the latest version, and clicked \"Apply Changes.\"\nFinally, reboot to apply changes.\n", "Q: Issue with Software Updater installing new kernel I woul like to know if anyone could help me with a software updater/apt-upgrade issue (or not).\nWhen I run the software updater, it prompts the updates for the kernel 3.19.0-42.48, but when I click on install now, it loads \"something\" and closes automatically, without any advise.\nWhen I run apt-get upgrade, it shows me the available update, I accept them but kernel is not downloaded.\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update to update repositories and package information\n\n*sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to update packages and their dependencies\n\n\nThis should update your kernel as well.\n", "Q: Terminal: Check the status/progress of a running application? Let's say I run a process on machine 1: sudo badblocks -sv /dev/sdb and I'd like to check the status of that running process on machine 2. Of course I'd SSH into that box, but what kind of Terminal trickery would I use to see the status/progress of that running process?\n\nA: You need to use a terminal multiplexer like screen or tmux they let you detach from a terminal session then reattach when ever you like. They are fairly easy to use but I would suggest for your first steps to use an application call byobu so on the machine where you are going to run your commands on you would do the following\nsudo apt-get install byobu -y\nbyobu-enable\nbyobu\nsudo badblocks -sv /dev/sdb\n\nAt this point you will be able to close your terminal and it will still be running .  Then just ssh back to your machine and it will automatically put you back in the session.\nOnce you get comfortable with that then look at using tmux really powerful tool for doing this.\n", "Q: archived .deb file error-specified file is not found using dpkg i think my problem may be simpler than i am making it, but i am still learning linux servers the hard way.\ni cannot install or update packages, and i managed to track it to an archived version of the linux kernal, or that is what it looks like.\ni attempted to fix through the software center (i installed a GUI desktop for easier management option) and attempted to use 'sudo dpkg -p' with the file, the software center failed, dpkg was unable to locate the file specified, but i copied the name exactly from the error prompt in terminal\nfile name is:\nlinux-image-3.16.0-49-generic_3.16.0-49.65-14.04.1_amd64.deb\nis there another way to fix this without potentially losing all information on the system, i use this for a family server and would prefer to keep all of our info on it, though if no other option the information is recoverable.\n\nA: What is the reason for attempting to install linux-image-3.16.0-49-generic_3.16.0-49.65-14.04.1_amd64.deb manually?\nIf you're trying to update your system, please try the following commands.

This can be done in python or in C. An example can be found here: http://conjurecode.com/create-indicator-applet-for-ubuntu-unity-with-python/\nIn order to run a shell script, you would need to use the subprocess module in python. In order to start using the appindicator module in python you would need to install the package python-appindicator by running sudo apt-get install python-appindicator:\n", "Q: No Audio when booting from Windows or vice versa I have an interesting problem that I'm currently stuck on. I'm using Ubuntu 15.10 alongside Windows 10 in a dual-boot system on a 2015 XPS 13. But every time I restart to another OS, my audio stops working. \nTo fix this issues, I shut down my computer, wait a couple of seconds, then boot again. Sometimes I need to repeat this procedure multiple times before it gets back to normal.\nAny ideas what might be the cause of this problem?\n\nA: It is a known bug with the I2S Audio Interface. \nFor the moment there is no workaround. Just wait for the bug to be fixed (let's hope for Ubuntu 16.04).\n", "Q: Android Studio sdk directory I installed android-studio through ./studio.sh command in terminal and manually created desktop-entry with following details in it :\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.5.1\nType=Application\nName=Android Studio\nExec=bash -i \"/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\"\nIcon=/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.png\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=jetbrains-android-studio\nName[en_GB]=android-studio.desktop\n\nWhenever I launch android-studio through icon launcher it again runs the setup wizard and ask to download sdk. I have already downloaded and configured android studio with sdk. (The location of sdk is /root/Android/SDK whereas the new setup wizard tries to find sdk in the /home/user/ directory).\nHow do I launch the installed SDK via .dekstop file?\n\nA: Once you launch Android Studio, you should have a screen like this: \nClick on Configure and this will bring you here: \nStart the SDK Manager and then edit the Android SDK Location. \n\nA: This is happening because your sdk is in /root/Android instead of /home/user/Android.\nYou didn't install sdk for the account from which you are logged in, instead you installed it for root user. In this state studio will run normally if you log in as root (highly discouraged). Normally, sdk should be located in /home/user/Android or /opt/Android. Just move the sdk to the right place and everything would be alright.\n", "Q: Ubuntu writes the number 5 without beeing pressed I was looking at the bitcoin charts and when selecting 3 Years firefox stopped working for a short time and when it continued to work it wrote many 5 in the top bar like when you hold the key.\nUbuntu or more percisely has to be the cause of this problem because I have Kubuntu and Windows installed too and on them I've never had such problems.\nThis also happened to me when I left my pc alone. When I returned I saw that there were many letters in the password field.\nNow it happened again but I can't say how.

It did not work as suggested and part way through the upgrade I was faced with a grub rescue prompt. I found some help with this at this page - grub-rescue. I couldn't make the highest voted method work due to being unable to find the bootable partition using ls (hd0,msdos6)/ etc. etc., so used the second highest voted method which requires booting from a rescue-usb and running boot-repair.

Upon restart the windows 10 upgrade continued and finished as expected, except the boot menu doesn't appear with the option to boot into Ubuntu.

This can be installed by typing:\nsudo apt-get install arandr\n\nUse ARandR to  configure your screens, save it to a script (Layout > Save As), and set it to run as a Session and Startup > Application Autostart item. (You may need to set it to sleep 5 first before running the layout script.)\nPanorama background\nI recommend calculating your total screen space (3 of 1280x1024). Your total width is 3840px x 1024px height. Then I would search for panorama images somewhere like Google Images. Then your images can be cropped to fit the overall screen width and height. Right click on the far left desktop > select Desktop Settings > find the directory with your new images > Style (Spanning screens). Your monitors are all the same size. My center one is larger with two smaller same-size ones on the side. You may need to adjust the correct pixel height so the image lines up precisely. This can be done in the script you saved. Here is mine. Note the second pixel value after --pos. (That one side monitor is 4px higher than the other.) \nxrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 1440x900 --pos 0x30 --rotate normal --output DVI-0 --mode 1440x900 --pos 3120x34 --rotate normal --output HDMI-0 --mode 1680x1050 --pos 1440x0 --rotate normal \n\nBIOS setting\nI also use three monitors at work. The Dell at work and Lenovo at home both have a BIOS setting where they reserve 1 GB of RAM (given each card is 1 GB). In the Lenovo the BIOS setting is called Surround View. You have two 512 MB cards so your BIOS may be reserving about 1 GB of your RAM. If you have that setting in your BIOS, you can disble it now that you are using the arandr script to load the layout. \nBIOS Showing 8 GB RAM while Xubuntu only Showing 7 GB\n", "Q: Purge print jobs older than say 30 days Is there something like this in Ubuntu, or a way to immediately delete jobs after print succeeded?\n\nA: And I had http://localhost:631/admin/?ADVANCEDSETTINGS=YES set to 1d (I suppose this means 1 day) not working.

Say I execute a command with sudo, then if I use sudo within the next 15/5 minutes (not sure how long it remembers me for) it won't prompt me for a password. It will only prompt me again if I haven't used it for at least that long.\nHowever, if I suspend my machine, wake it up, and login before that time period has ended, I can just execute a sudo command again and it won't ask me for my password because I haven't let it be for the certain amount of time.\nSo how can I make it so that no matter how long I haven't used sudo for, it will definitely prompt me for a password after the suspend once I've logged in again, even if I'm still within that time frame where the 15/5 minutes of not using sudo haven't passed yet?\nThe most likely thing that will work is to get it to execute a command to remove all identity caches for sudo upon the execution of a certain command which is executed on wakeup.\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: Only if you are that paranoid! You can use the -K option of sudo.\n-K, --reset-timestamp\n       When used without a command, invalidates the user's cached credentials.  \n       In other words, the next time sudo is run a password will be required.  \n       This option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to revoke\n       sudo permissions from a .logout file.\n\n       When used in conjunction with a command or an option that may require a \n       password, this option will cause sudo to ignore the user's cached credentials.  \n       As a result, sudo will prompt for a password (if one is required by the \n       security policy) and will not update the user's cached credentials.\n\n       Not all security policies support credential caching.\n\nfor example,\nsudo -K <command>\n\nOr you could just leave your computer in a metal box guarded by robots :)\n\nA: From man sudo:\n     -K, --remove-timestamp\n                 Similar to the -k option, except that it removes the user's\n                 cached credentials entirely and may not be used in conjunc‐\n                 tion with a command or other option.

I have an Ubuntu server working fine in the Intranet and I need to access my files from the internet. I read forums and don't understand them well. Have an easy way? Security is not the priority now.\n\nA: Security is always a priority and I'm afraid there is no easier way than this:\nPort forwarding\nYou will need to setup port forwarding for all ports that you want accessible through the internet. Note that every open port poses a potential security risk, so be sparse here. Look at a list of port numbers by service to get an idea, which ports to forward. The most commonly forwarded are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Port 22: SSH (for remotely managing your server)\n\n*Port 80: HTTP (websites)\n\n*Port 443: HTTPS (encrypted websites)\n\n*Port 989-990: FTP (file sharing)\n\n\nThe exact procedure for forwarding a port differs from router vendor to vendor and even between models. You will have to consult your router's manual and/or the internet for your specific router. Below, I attached an image of what the menu looks for Ubee my cable modem. \nBasically you specify the incoming port range (80-80 for http), the local IP of your server to forward packets to (192.168.10 in my picture) and the port range on the server that requests should go to (again 80-80 in my example). \nNote that some internet service providers block port 80 precisely to keep you from running your own home web server. This not much more than annoying, because you can just use another port. Many dynamic DNS services (see below) allow to specify an alternative port. To get very comprehensive info about your internet connection, including which ports are blocked, you can use the netalyzr of UC Berkely. If it doesn't work, you can use something else or check if you allowed Java Applets in browser\n\nAccess via internet IP\nOnce you've done this people can access your web server already via your internet IP. They just have to enter the IP and port, e.g. 213.109.33.44:80, in the address field of their browsers. In this example I specify port 80 explicitly, which generally not needed. If port 80 is blocked, use something else instead. As one of the many ways to get your internet IP, you may enter the following command in a shell:\ndig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com\n\nThe problem with accessing your server via IP is twofold:\n\n\n*\n\n*IPs are hard to remember \n\n*IPs are subject to change, if your internet service provider decides to (sometimes without notice), that is unless you're paying for a static IP. \n\n\nDynamic DNS Service\nTo get around those problems, you can either register a domain with your national authority and update the IP associated with the domain there manually or automatically every time it changes or use a dynamic DNS provider. I will talk about the latter a bit.\nI use noip, they are free and only pester you every month or so to upgrade to their paid accounts. That's just a personal choice based on what was available 5 years ago. You should consult a recent comparison of dynamic DNS provides to choose. \nIn turn these dynamic DNS services will provide you with a redirect from an URL such as www.your-server.no-ip.com to your actual IP. For noip your server's address will be a sub-domain of one of their top-level domains (here no-ip.com). Generally you can chose the sub-domain name to be whatever you like, e.g. fluffy-bunnies.no-ip.com.\nAutomatically updating IP at dynamic DNS provider\nOnce you have the account, you can configure your router (if it supports that - see its manual) or Ubuntu to update the external DNS service. The service needs to be notified of your changing server IP periodically. Again, the exact procedure depends on your dynamic DNS provider. They usually have instructions on their website. I've found that ddclient is a good way to do it. It supports most common providers. To install it use:\nsudo apt-get install ddclient\n\nThen edit the config file in /etc/ddclient.conf. Mine for noip looks like this:\nprotocol=dyndns2\ndaemon=36000\npid=/var/run/ddclient.pid\nssl=yes\nuse=web, web=checkip.dyndns.com/, web-skip='IP Address'\nserver=dynupdate.no-ip.com\nlogin=confus\npassword='1234321'\nconserve.no-ip.org\n\nRestart\nChanges will take effect after server reboot or after you restart ddclient with:\nsudo service ddclient restart\n\n\nThis works for Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (Trusty Tar) and ddclient 3.8.1.\n\nA: Like @fkraiem said in the comments, you need to set up port forwarding on your router. Not all routers actually have this available, but newer Linksys/Belkin routers have it available, and Cisco routers should all have port forwarding.\nSince you didn't provide very many details, I can't give an exact tutorial, but if you do happen to find the port forwarding menu in your router's web interface, you will want to forward port 80 to the IP address of the server.\nNOTE: Many ISPs actually block incoming connections to port 80 for \"safety reasons.\" You may have to change your web server to run on port 8080 and forward that.\nOnce you have port forwarding set up, you need to know your external IP in order to connect. You can just Google \"what's my IP\" to find it. Be aware that this IP is usually dynamic, which means it changes periodically. If you would like a permanent address, I recommend using No-IP to set up dynamic DNS.\nIf you need more details, leave a comment with yur router model, and I can help out further.\n\nA: Putting your server online may not be related to the server that you created, instead it would require the process of setting up your router/firewall to allow access from the internet to the server. This process has several different methods. You should consider your networks topology, the structure of it, before you allow inbound traffic from the internet to your LAN. I would suggest that you take a look at PFSnense as a firewall, and use this to create a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) on your network. This is a branch of your network that your primary LAN has access to, but the DMZ does not have access to the LAN. This is where your server hardware will be. Also, the type of wide area network address that you have makes a difference in being able to access the services provided by you server. If you have an address that is provided via DHCP (dynamic host control protocol) then you will need a dynamic DNS provider. I will assume that this is the case since static IP addresses come at a cost and there would be no reason for you to by one if you have never put a server online before. That being said, the process should go as follows:\nStep 1)\nGet an old computer to function as a fire wall. Make sure it has at least 3 ethernet controller ports. Install PFSense, and set it up such that one controller is the LAN port, one controller is the DMZ port, and one controller is the WAN port. For setting up a firewall in this configuration, please view the following page.\nhttp://linoxide.com/firewall/install-pfsense-firewall/\nand then\ndoc.pfsense.org/index.php/Example_basic_configuration\nStep 2)\nSet up a dynamic DNS url:\nhttp://freedns.afraid.org/\nor (a bit easier, but may cost money)\ndyn.com/remote-access/\nStep 3)\nCreate a cname alias for your domain name that points to your dynamic DNS url.\nStep 4)\nConfigure your PFSense installation to use whichever method of dynamic DNS you selected.\n\nIf you choose not to use Dynamic DNS, which may totally be the case, you will need to configure your WAN port of the fire wall to use a Static IP address. Then you will need to point your URL's @ A record to that Static IP address.\nStatic IP Step 2)\nportal.pfsense.org/docs/manuals/c2758/getting-started.html\nStatic IP Step 3)\nThen log into your domain name registrar and update the @A record to point to the static IP address on your wan port. Be sure that you do the first step of setting up a DMZ before doing these. There are a lot probers out there looking to break into your server and use it maliciously.\n\nnote\nI'm sorry, I could only post two links in this explanation.

Some software that I'm using needs a higher-than-default value in /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches. I can modify this value with a text editor or from the terminal, and for a little while, everything is fine. However, after restarting my computer (not just logging out and in again, which works fine), the value has reset to 8192.\nWhy does this happen, and how can I make the change permanent?\n\nA: From: /usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-default.conf:    \n\nTo override settings in this file, create a local file in /etc (e.g. /etc/sysctl.d/90-override.conf), and put any assignments there.\n\nSo create the file: nano /etc/sysctl.d/90-override.conf.\nAnd populate it with: fs.inotify.max_user_watches=65536.\nThis will now be used when you restart your server to populate: /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\nThere is no need therefore to edit /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches. Once you've followed the above you can restart your server for the new setting to take affect. \n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04 the following worked for me...\necho \"fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo sysctl -p\n\nwhere 524288 is the higher-than-default number that I'm using.

Would anyone be able to help, please?\nthanks!\n\nA: As you have probably figured out, this has very little to do with Plex.  All Plex does is look at the folders presented to the local linux machine as the active Plex user, which by default is the user 'plex'.  \nGiven you are being prompted for a password, this is likely the sticking point, or at least the first sticking point to begin addressing fault finding - (the second one will be just making sure that the files and directories have appropriate access).\nBefore I say anything further though, I've personally found NFS to be much more reliable and simpler to set up.  Basically NFS is less CPU intensive and works better between *NIX systems anyway.  If you want to go down that route, here's an example of one of my NFS lines in my fstab in case it helps:\n192.168.43.15:Video   /mnt/Video  nfs   rw,hard,intr    0   0\nAnother option for you is to use the chmod command and make sure that read only is set to everyone.  That way, you could omit the password altogether.  So, on your NAS (and in a console) type in 'sudo chmod -Rv 764 yoursharedirectory'.  I'd say that would do the trick.\nI've now written a whole guide on plex permissions, which can get into quite a complex topic but I've tried to keep it as simple as possible.\nHave a look at the link below and let me know if that helps or you need anything further.\nhttps://www.tech-knowhow.com/2016/03/how-to-plex-permissions-linux/\nLet me know how it goes.\n@marshalleq\n", "Q: XRDP Problem Ubuntu 14.04.1 I have 14.04.1 installed on a laptop in the basement with no working display.

I would suggest you to try to connect to your remote ubuntu machine using either mstsc.exe from a Windows machine or install on your linux machine next to remmina another remote desktop client.   You can install rdesktop or xfreerdp client (they are command line based client).  for the rdesktop, there is a basic gui interface called grdesktop. \nIf you can connect through these clients, the problem is remmina. if you cannot, xRDP might be the problem and you can start looking into the logs (in /var/logs/xrdp *  and in your ~/.xsession file to see  any connection issue \nHope this help \n", "Q: What is $Recycle.Bin in LS output?

This processor (according to the Intel page here) is of a 64-bit architecture. If your computer has 2 or more Gb of RAM, the 64-bit version of Ubuntu (or derivatives) is (are) recommended and will run quite well. If you have less than 2Gb of RAM,then the 32-bit version will involve a significant enough reduction in memory overhead that it will run better on your machine than the 64-bit version.\nTL;DR:\nyour computer can run either, but if you have less than 2Gb of RAM use the 32-bit version.

I have 2 questions is what I did with the scaling actually a solution or just a temporary fix and if so is there an actual solution? And what can I do about the text font being so small in Firefox?\n\nA: By default, Firefox sets the size of icons in the toolbar, home button, etc., based on the size set by your system, using a value of -1.0 on  layout.css.devPixelsPerPx.\nIf you've adjusted the icon sizes in Settings, or with something like Gnome Tweak, this could affect the size of your icons in the Firefox toolbar.\nYou can oveeride this in advanced preferences:\n\n*\n\n*Open an new tab and type about:config into the address bar\n\n*Search for layout.css.devPixelsPerPx\n\n*Change the value from -1.0 to 1.5 or a size that suits you\n\nMake sure you don't change it to below 1.0, otherwise the icons could become to small to interact with.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Studio 15.10 - icons not appearing in Kdenlive I get no icons in the toolbars of Kdenlive in Ubuntu Studio 15.10.

In all cases, I have tried changing the settings (in Kdenlive) from \"Text alongside icons\" to \"Icons only\", but to no avail.\nI tried changing themes, which didn't solve the issue, and Kdenlive didn't allow me to configure the themes in Settings, resulting in the error Cannot start Colors Settings panel from KDE Control Center.

I'd prefer not to install Plasma 5.x or the Kubuntu Desktop, since I've read it messes up the whole OS.

This solved my issue with missing Kdenlive icons.\nMake sure you have installed Oxygen default icon theme.\n\nA: Ok - this is a late answer and the ones already given cover most cases. But I want to add that sometimes the impression that icons do not appear stem from kdenlive's compact and expanded modes of showing tracks. In the compact mode it does not show icons. Like that:\n\nIt might be the default in your case - you're not seeing the familiar icons because it is not in \"big\" (expanded) mode. You just need to click the discreet icon \"Bigger tracks\":\n\nAnd then, BAM!

The only problem is, that the effect stack hides itself under the Kdenlive window, but I can bring it back or drag Kdenlive to the side to reach the effect stack. Actually, this also happens in the pre-installed 15.08 Kdenlive of Ubuntu Studio 15.10.\nSo Kdenlive is quite buggy in Ubuntu Studio 15.10, but better than in Linux Mint 17.3.

This PC only has Ubuntu 14.10 on it as well as I can tell.\n\nA: EDIT: before doing anything, have in mind that you can install Cinnamon (Mint's Desktop Environment) in Ubuntu and it will feel pretty much the same.\nFirst download and install Mint into your USB stick. Boot from it.\n\n\n*\n\n*First step: check if everything works.\n\n\nYou're going to erase Ubuntu and leave your system without any OS until you finish installing Mint. So make sure everything you need (and even what you don't need) works. Check internet connection (wired/wireless), software updates, video/audio streaming, software installation, configuration, etc. After you are absolutely sure that everything works we can go to the next step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup everything from Ubuntu.\n\n\nReboot your computer into Ubuntu. Put all your files in an external drive. Also get a list from your installed apps so you can reinstall them on Mint afterwards. To do it, take a look at this topic: askubuntu.com/questions/17823/how-to-list-all-installed-packages\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase Ubuntu.\n\n\nBoot from your Mint Live USB. Open a terminal and run:\nsudo gparted\nGParted (GNOME Partition Editor) will open up. You can use it to manage your disks/partitions. It should automatically open your main disk; to make sure, click GParted tab>Devices and make sure your main disk is selected. I suppose you have only one HDD/SSD, so it should be /dev/sda.\nThe following are instructions to remove everything from your disk. If you want to restore Windows (if it's still there) make sure to NOT delete its partition (it should be NTFS formatted). No changes will be made until you click \"Apply\".\n\n\n*\n\n*To remove everything from your disk, right-click every single partition listed in it and click \"Delete\". After you've deleted everything there will be a single, gray unallocated space. Right-click it and click \"New\". Make sure it is selected to use the whole disk space and format it to ext4. Give it a label, e.g. \"Linux Mint\". Click \"OK\". Now click \"Apply\" (the green check symbol) and the changes will be written to the disk. It shouldn't take more than 1 or 2 minutes. Ubuntu (and all the disk content) is now removed.\n\n*Install Linux Mint.\nClose GParted and the terminal window. Start Mint's installer. It's pretty much the same as Ubuntu; you should already know how to install it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Test if everything works.\n\n\nIf Mint was successfully installed, the installer will ask you to reboot. Do it and test your new system!\n", "Q: Clean Installed Ubuntu 14.04 - Second HDD is Read Only - How to gain permissions?

I says about ntfsfix in ubuntu but have not tried it. \nI too have dual boot:Windows 8.1 and Ununtu 15.10 and solved this problem by disabling the fast startup.\n\nA: The paging file on the NTFS disk is holding memory contents from hibernation,or at least the file system has it marked that way. To prevent irreversible destruction of a previous Windows session, and because NTFS is not completely understood by Linux NTFS reverse engineers, the NTFS package in Ubuntu will not permit rw access, because it doesn't really know Windows will never restore the hibernated session.\nSo, you can remove the hibernation file with  linux # sudo ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sdb1 /path to mount point Change sdb1 to whichever device Windows was on (NTFS volume). Should mount rw after that.\n", "Q: zsh suggesting what packages to install I love using zsh but there is one feature that bash has that I miss.

I'm looking for the equivalent of FrontPage for Ubuntu.  FrontPage is a site and not just a page editor because it maintains links as pages graphics are moved around and even when the architecture is changed.  And, very important to a busy executive, it has an auto-thumbnail feature.\nSo far the advice has been \n\n\n*\n\n*Learn HTML and Javascript.  zero interest or time.\n\n*Blue Gryphon - gimpware that will probably go away with Mozilla's XUL API.  I've tried it and find it a decent page editor but not a site editor.  Plus he's abandoned 32 bit users.\n\n*Amaya - I think it would be a nice Page editor if it would run properly on my machine (12.04LTS).  As is, there is a 1 or 2 pixel line where the tool bar should be.  And it won't render anything until some toolbar action is taken.  I can work at it and hit a toolbar item with the cursor, whereup the page renders.  IT still appears to only be a page editor, though.\n\n*Brackets - HTML editor.  Not applicable.\n\n*Use a CMS - I have a blog on WordPress.  Over my Hughsnet link it takes approximately 15 seconds for the first page to load while WP sends out seemingly hundreds of files.  My personal site's FrontPage-created index page loads in a second.  Maybe I'm the last guy on earth who cares about load times but I do.  I realize that not everybody has or can get a gigabit connection.\nSo I ask again, is there a website editor out there for Ubuntu?  I'll even consider a commercial product.  Or do I have to continue editing with FrontPage in a VM?\n\nA: you could always try to run frontpage through wine, then at least you don't have to use virtual machine... maybe it will work, but cannot promise you anything. if you already have the frontpage installer you could try it very easily by right-clicking the setup file and opening it with wine program loader.. if you do not have wine you can always install it.. it is free. http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Wine-on-Ubuntu\n, but remember that open-source is always nicer than proprietary. even though the website editors are a bit of a devil. \nmaybe also there are some online editors that can help you, try searching for that. Also php can be quite magical.. once coded = no more worries\n", "Q: I need help cleaning my /boot I'm a linux nubie. For some reason my /boot is really small.

I took a screen shot of what is on my /boot, any help in what is extra and what I should remove is appreciated. thanks!\n\n\n\nA: A safe way to remove the old kernels is to install Ubuntu Tweak.  Then click on \"Start Janitor\", check the \"Old Kernel\" box on the left, check the \"Old Kernels\" entry that appears in the middle, then click \"Clean\" and input your password.  You're done. \n\nA: To remove kernel version 3.19.0-xx-generic, just do\nsudo apt-get remove --purge linux-image-3.19.0-xx-generic\n\nIn case you also have the kernel headers installed, likewise remove linux-headers-3.19.0-xx.\n", "Q: Byobu shift-arrow key shortcut After using GNU screen for years I have recently started to use Byobu. The F shortcuts are a bit far for my my liking so I want to use shift/alt - arrow keys. Alt-left/right arrow works find for switching between windows, and Alt-up/down arrow works fine for sessions switching, however Shift-left/right/up/down arrow do nothing except scroll the konsole (I am using KDE so Kubuntu). I am sure they probably work when only in a terminal, for example, when I SSH in via putty however when at my PC locally they scroll. My guess was that these shortcuts are set globally somewhere by something else, but I have searched everywhere and can not find any shortcuts to disable.\n\nA: Konsole doesn't work with some (many?) of Byobu's key bindings.  It seems that Konsole \"eats\" some of these key presses, unfortunately.

Maybe this is that way because my monitor is pretty old. This is in no way a correct answer to the larger problem i.e. the inability to set the correct resolution through xrandr but I will live with it.\n\nA: You need to create a new mode and apply it.\nThe commands to be executed in order:\ncvt 1440 900\nxrandr --newmode \"1440x900_60\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nThe part of the line after xrandr --newmode is similar to the ouput you should get when using the cvt command, so copy the output from the \"resolution_refreshRate\" (\"1440x900_60\" here) point to the +vsync point and add it to xrandr --newmode.\nThen:\nxrandr --addmode LVDS1 resolution_refreshRate (don't use speechmarks)\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode resolution_refreshRate\n\nIf you want to make the changes permanent:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bash script, xrandr.sh for example, and place your xrandr commands into it: #!/bin/bash\nsudo xrandr --newmode \"\"1440x900_60\"\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nsudo xrandr --addmode LVDS1 1440x900_60\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1440x900_60\n\n*Make the script executable with chmod +x xrandr.sh\n\n*Search for \"Startup Applications\" in the dash, run it, and add the script as a startup application.\nThe commands will now run every time you log into your account.\nNote: I'm using LVDS1 as the supposed monitor name, but yours probably won't be the same.

You should have an application installed that can execute .is files (I.e. a browser), so the launcher should open it in one of them.\nI'm not familiar with SublimeText, but if you're using the terminal at all, it would probably be more convenient for you to just create an alias or a function that executes your file:\nalias go=chromium-browser myfile.js\nUsed like:\ngo\nOr\nfunction go() { chromium-browser $@; }\nUsed like:\ngo differentFile.js\n", "Q: Unable to locate package libapache2-mod-auth-mysql Trying to install this package on Ubuntu using sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-auth-mysql, but I get the message in the title.

But I can make it bootup as a USB HDD. \nCan any one help please ?\n\nA: Some older machines cannot boot off a USB device.  If in the BIOS boot order you have a USB choice, then you can boot off USB.  If you don't, then you need to boot some other way, and then run the programs on the USB device.  \nAssuming you can boot off USB, the USB device will probably be given a different name than the internal hard disk(sda).  If you have ever run update-grub or installed an updated kernel, then any actual devices mentioned in the grub.cfg file will have been converted to a UUID reference, which is device independent -- you should just be able to move the disk anywhere and even if the device name changes, the UUID will not, so it should still boot.  \nThe new machines with Windows 8 preinstalled, have a new boot mechanism, and are called UEFI machines.  The legacy boot mechanism starts with code sitting in the first block of the disk, while the UEFI boot runs bootloaders from a FAT filesystem.  The internal hard disk would have a bootloader order (in case of several bootloaders) to run from the filesystem.  If you move the disk to an external enclosure, then the internal order may not be valid, so the default bootloader for \"removable media\" would be used (/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi).  That default bootloader may or may not have been set up by your installer, since it typically is not used for an internal disk, but it can be just a copy (renamed to bootx64.efi) of the bootloader typically run.  Anyway, UEFI may not apply here.  \nIt's usually pretty easy to just move an internal disk to an external enclosure.\n", "Q: Can I override a Linux install? (Replace Distro) I was wondering...Say, if I install Ubuntu on a secondary partition (Windows dual-boot), and wanted to try another distribution - could I just make a bootable ISO (live USB) and just select the existing Ubuntu partition for the new distribution? If so, would all my files be in place?\nThanks.\n\nA: That depends on the versatility of the distro's installer. Ubuntu is able to recognize previous Ubuntu installations on dual/multi boot computers and provides the option to replace all or keep existing Documents and programs. I'm sure that the other Ubuntu-like distros do as well. Debian Jessie might. With Mint, it depends on the version number. I doubt Arch will.\n\nA: Yes, you can do this and yes, most of your files (especially your home folder, but probably not most programs) will be preserved provided you select the preserve my home folder option in the installer, or backup your home folder.\n", "Q: How to create a new folder from a terminal with administrative permissions? I want to install JAVA, but the installation instructions ask me to create a new folder, called /java/, into the standard /usr/ folder.\nBut this folder is blocked. I mean, I can not to create a new folder on it, with the PCManFM file manager, because that option is grey.\nSo I guess there should be a command to create it from a Terminal session. (With sudo, maybe?)\nHow can I get it? Which is the right command to get it?\n\nA: I'm going to address two parts of your question: java installation and folder creation. \nJava installation\nWe already have a question about that: How can I install Sun/Oracle's proprietary Java JDK 6/7/8 or JRE?.All of the necessary commands are there, and I strongly suggest you read their manual pages with man COMMAND in terminal. \nThere's also open-source version of Java, Open JDK. Installation of that is somewhat simpler\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jdk icedtea-7-plugin\n\nThat's pretty much it - apt-get will take care of everything. When you install some package with apt-get or dpkg there should be preinstall and postinstall scripts that come along with the package, and run automatically to set up whatever program you're getting.\nFolder Creation\nFolder ( in linux terminology - directory ) creation, just like file creation, depends on the permissions. If a folder has the following permissions,\ndrwxr-xr-x 15 testuser  testuser   4096 Nov 22 12:34 testuser/\n\nthat means the owner of that folder testuser can read-write-execute stuff there (first rwx), and group testuser can only read and execute stuff there - that's the r-x part, and final r-x part means read execute for any other groups or users.\n/usr folder is owned by root user, so only root can write there, that means create files or folder. Hence for that you need sudo to gain root privileges temporarily.\n\nA: You have a few choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*gksudo pcmanfm will request you enter your password, then open PCManFM as root, which is somewhat dangerous because if you are not careful you may unintentionally modify system files.\n\n*sudo mkdir /usr/java will create the directory directly.\n\nA: Create the folder from a command line terminal using:\nsudo mkdir /usr/java\n\nYou need sudo to make changes to /usr because /usr is owned by the root user.\n\nA: Creates folders and files\n\nmkdir -p ~/example(Folder)/text(Folder)\ntouch ~/example(folders)/text(Folder)/text{1..420}.txt\nchmod -R 757 ~/example (folder with rights)\n\n\nMove the text to another created folder\n\nmkdir -p /Sturrage/V1Tst/Memes\nmv ~/example/text/text{1..125}.txt /Sturrage/V1Tst/Memes\n\n\nSame thing but with another folder to put all the text files that are left behind and with rights and user.\n\nmkdir -p /V1Tst/Trash\ncp ~/example/text/* /V1Tst/Trash\nchmod -R 727 /V1Tst\nchown -R user:group /V1Tst\n\n", "Q: Alfa awus036h wireless adapter acting strange I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, I recently got an alfa awus036h and plugged it in. whenever I go to network settings it keeps connecting and disconnecting repetitively. the light on the adapter also flashes every time it connects.\nI installed the drivers from realtek's website and it still does the same. does anyone know what I should do to fix this problem?

I can connect to the internet via Network Manager but I can't call with it. So I tried to install modem drivers (which has *.exe extension and includes connector application) with WINE, but the connector did not launch.\nSo my questions are:\na. Is it possible to install Windows drivers with Wine? If it is possible, how?\nb. If it is impossible, how can I call with my modem?\nI did not find any answers in the Internet. So, I am sorry, if it is duplicate.\nModem type: ZTE CORPORATION MF190V\nWine version: 1.7\nUbuntu version: 15.04 vivid\n\nA: You seems to have a bit of misunderstanding. At first, if you can connect to the internet, then you already have drivers for that modem, and they're working. The drivers have nothing to do with making phone calls via modem, they're only provide networking.\nI guess you have GSM modem, right? Hypothetically you can do calls with AT commands, but I'm pretty sure, you wouldn't want doing that by hand ☺ You can try Modem Manager GUI. Or you could try to get to work the app, which is shipped with modem, through wine. I think, there should be a way to get it work, because working with GSM modem from the user level boils down to sending AT commands with data into a serial port (COMx in Windows, also there's nothing wrong with the fact that the modem is actually USB — it's just virtual serial port being created). Though I think it could be not that easy.\nConsider also sending a mail into ZTE of why aren't they ship the GNU/Linux GUI. Be intrusive — the more attention everyone brings, the more possibility they would start building GNU/Linux GUI too.\nAnd just for the check: no, you can't install drivers with wine.

I'm in OS X. In the refind-install script, there's a bless command that is running, but doesn't seem to work:\n   elif [[ \"$TargetDir\" != \"/EFI/BOOT\" ]] ; then\n      bless --setBoot --folder \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir\" --file \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir/$Refind\"\n      echo BLESS COMMAND: bless --setBoot --folder \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir\" --file \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir/$Refind\"\n   fi\n\nI added the extra echo line to see what the command looks like, and this is the output:\nBLESS COMMAND: bless --setBoot --folder /Volumes/efi///EFI/refind --file /Volumes/efi///EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi\n\nI'm running the install script like this:\nsudo ./refind-install --root /Volumes/efi\n\nwhere /Volume/efi contains the root of a custom EFI System Partition on disk0s6, not my MacBook's default disk0s1 ESP.\nAny idea why it doesn't work and how to get rEFInd to boot by default?\nEDIT:\nAlright, I think I might know what's wrong. So, I was able to make it work by replacing the --root option to refind-install with the --usedefault option, like this:\nsudo ./refind-install --usedefault /dev/disk0s6\n\nNow, what happens next is that the script ignores /dev/disk0s6 and goes ahead and install rEFInd to /dev/disk0s1, the main OS X ESP (which isn't what I desired, but it works).\nThe script then goes ahead and runs the other bless command:\n   if [[ $InstallToEspOnMac == \"1\" ]] ; then\n      bless --mount \"$InstallDir\" --setBoot --file \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir/$Refind\" --shortform\n   elif [[ \"$TargetDir\" != \"/EFI/BOOT\" ]] ; then\n\nAfter rebooting, this works, and rEFInd boots by default. I have a hunch that this is working due to rEFInd being installed to the default /EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi inside the OS X ESP partition.\nBut this isn't what I want. I'd like to have refind installed on /dev/disk0s6, in /EFI/refind/ instead of /EFI/BOOT.\nEDIT:\nAlso note that when using the --usedefault option, the install script installs refind_aa64.efi into /EFI/BOOT of the OS X ESP (disk0s1) but when using the --root option to install to disk0s6 the script instead installs refind_x86.efi\nAlso, I'm not sure if perhaps having the --mount option in one bless command but not the other is what made the difference.\nEDIT:\nI was able to copy over /EFI/BOOT from disk0s1 to disk0s6, then run the same --mount bless command as in the script, and that worked.\nEDIT:\nAlright, we're getting closer. I modified the script, and changed\n   elif [[ \"$TargetDir\" != \"/EFI/BOOT\" ]] ; then\n      bless --setBoot --folder \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir\" --file \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir/$Refind\"\n   fi\n\nto\n   elif [[ \"$TargetDir\" != \"/EFI/BOOT\" ]] ; then\n      bless --mount \"$InstallDir\" --setBoot --file \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir/$Refind\"\n   fi\n\nand now that works as I want: refind installed to /EFI/refind on the partition whose mount point I specify with the --root option. Although this gives me the result I was looking for, there is now one small problem: it takes around 30 seconds or more to finally arrive at rEFInd when booting, which is really slow for some reason. I'm going to reset NVRAM and try again...\nEDIT\nAha! Before resetting NVRAM, I tried adding the --shortform option to the bless command, and that fixed the lag issue in the previous edit!\nWhy is the second bless command in --folder mode? It seems to work better in --mount mode.\nSo, for now, the solution was to modify the second bless command in the script to be exactly like the first, so that part of the script looks like this:\n   if [[ $InstallToEspOnMac == \"1\" ]] ; then\n      bless --mount \"$InstallDir\" --setBoot --file \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir/$Refind\" --shortform\n   elif [[ \"$TargetDir\" != \"/EFI/BOOT\" ]] ; then\n      bless --mount \"$InstallDir\" --setBoot --file \"$InstallDir/$TargetDir/$Refind\" --shortform\n   fi\n\nand I used the --root option for refind-install to specify the mount point of the target partition.\nmkdir /Volumes/efi\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s6 /Volumes/efi\nsudo ./refind-install --root /Volumes/efi\n\n\nA: First, the --root option is not used to specify an ESP; it's used to specify your normal installation's root (/) directory. It's intended for use when installing rEFInd from a Linux emergency system, although it could be used from an OS X system (but would likely not be very useful there, except maybe in conjunction with --notesp -- but I've not tested that). Thus, you're basically \"barking up the wrong tree\" in trying to use that option.\nThe refind-install script doesn't really have any explicit options to install rEFInd to a secondary ESP. In Linux, you can control the ESP by mounting the one you want at /boot or /boot/efi; but in OS X, the ESP isn't normally mounted, so the script tries to find the ESP, and if you have multiple ESPs, it's not guaranteed to use the one you want. In such a case, you pretty much have to fall back to manual installation, as described here:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#osx\nAlternatively, you could use --ownhfs to install rEFInd to a dedicated HFS+ volume. Note that having two ESPs is not likely to be helpful. I know you say you want two ESPs, but you haven't said why you want that, and in the absence of a reason, my suggestion is that you forget about it because there's probably no benefit. The ESP is meant to be shared across OSes. There is a danger of one OS messing up another OS's files on the ESP, but keeping a backup should enable you to recover from such problems.\nAFAIK, the --folder option to bless works when installing to an HFS+ volume, but not when installing to a FAT volume. Some of the details of this command don't seem to be well-documented, though -- or at least, I've not found good documentation. IIRC, when I wrote refind-install, I took examples from various sites and experimented until I got something that worked, then tweaked it over time using feedback from other users.\n\nA: I might be wrong, but if you want to have refind showing up after boot, I believe you must choose your ESP partition for refind.\nAre you trying to instal from Linux or from Mac OS X?\n", "Q: GEFORCE GTX 660 Ti Driver issues Preface: I am somewhat tech savvy, but a complete newbie when it comes to building my own PC and also a complete newbie with Linux/Ubuntu.\nSo, I recently built my first PC and loaded Ubuntu 14.04 on it.

Both mean nothing to your system\nThe script is based on the usage of xprintidle.  xprintidle keeps track of both keyboard- and mouse events and measures the time there was no activity. If the demanding process starts, it is immediately paused (since the computer is obviously used) with the command: \nkill -STOP <pid>\n\nIf, subsequently, the idle time exceeds a certain (arbitrary) time limit, the process is resumed, using the command:\nkill -CONT <pid>\n\nSubsequently, if idle time returns to below the set time limit, the process is paused again and so on.\n\ncpu usage before/during/after idle time, rendering a large video with kdenlive using melt\nAbout kill -STOP and kill -CONT\nAlthough the arguments -STOP and -CONT are mentioned in man kill, it is not explained, strangely. However, for example here we can read what it does:\nBasically kill -STOP 1234 will pause the process with pid 1234, and kill -CONT 1234 will resume it. It’s as if you can sleep individual applications instead of your entire computer.\nThus the demanding process is put to sleep while the computer is used (un- idle).\nFinding the process to be paused\nThe script runs with the process name (you'd like to be paused if you use the computer) as an argument.\nThe trick is to find the correct process to be paused. It won't be the name of your video editor, since it will certainly use external tools to render. In my case, kdenlive used melt. The script successfully paused melt and resumed rendering after a defined idle time.\nYou can use the top command if you are unsure about the process name. Run top in a terminal and press Ctrl+M to sort on memory usage. The demanding process will be in the top.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\nlimit = int(sys.argv[1])\nproc = sys.argv[2]\n\ndef get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output(command).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef check_runs(proc):\n    try:\n        return get([\"pgrep\", proc])\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\npid1 = check_runs(proc)\nt1 = int(int(get(\"xprintidle\"))/1000)\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(5)\n    pid2 = check_runs(proc)\n    # (only) if the process exists, manage its activity\n    if pid2 != None:\n        t2 = int(int(get(\"xprintidle\"))/1000)\n        # if the process just started, obviously the system is not idle ->\n        # pause the process (try in case it was killed by user in between):\n        if pid1 == None:\n            try:\n                subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", \"-STOP\", pid2])\n            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n                pass\n        # If there is a change in time status (breaktime entered or ended)\n        else:              \n            if [t2 > limit, t1 > limit].count(True) == 1:\n                if t2 > limit:\n                    cmd = [\"kill\", \"-CONT\", pid2]\n                else:\n                    cmd = [\"kill\", \"-STOP\", pid2]\n                subprocess.Popen(cmd)\n        t1 = t2\n    pid1 = pid2\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs xprintidle\nsudo apt-get instal xprintidle\n\n\n*Copy the script above into an empty file, save it as manage_proc.py\n\n*Test- run it by the command\npython3 /path/to/manage_proc.py <seconds> <process_name>\n\nwhere <seconds> is the idle time in seconds before you'd like your process to start. \nStartup the consuming process after the script started.\n\n*If all works fine, add the script to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command:\n python3 /path/to/manage_proc.py <seconds> <process_name>\n\n", "Q: Remote SSH command requires a terminal So for one of my servers, most of what I do is edit files with vim. Is it possible to do something like ssh me@myserver vim ?\nWhen I try to do that, I get \"Warning, output is not to a terminal\", and vim is unusable.\nI read the ssh manpage, but bash doesn't like the escape character ~C to create a command terminal. \n\nA: Theory\nSSH sessions can be started with – or without – the remote server allocating a pseudo-terminal (PTY) device.\nUsually when you connect to a remote host via SSH (without specifying a command), you run your default login shell after authenticating correctly. When running this shell on a remote host, a pseudo-terminal is automatically allocated for the interactive shell. This allows the shell to write to the user’s screen so that it can do things such as display its prompt.\nDuring the interactive session, the SSH_TTY environment variable is set to the device node of the remote PTY device, e.g., /dev/pts/10 and when the pseudo-terminal exits, ssh prints the following message:\nConnection to <remotehost> closed.\n\nFor non-interactive SSH sessions, i.e., specifying a command to run on the remote host, no pseudo-terminal is allocated and the command output is sent to the stdout of the local terminal. This default behaviour works well when running commands that simply read input from stdin and print to stdout and/or stderr, e.g., ls, ps, etc. In this case the SSH_TTY environment variable is not set and I’ve also noticed that the TERM environment variable is set to dumb. When operating without a pseudo-terminal, the escape characters such as ~C are not supported; this makes it safe for programs to transfer binary files which may contain these sequences.\nHowever, programs such as vim or top need to be able to redraw the screen using various terminal capabilities (typically using the ncurses library). For this, they require a terminal device – or a device which emulates a terminal. The ssh client features a -t option which forces the allocation of a pseudo-terminal. This -t option is described in the SSH man page:\n\nForce pseudo-tty allocation.  This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful, e.g. when implementing menu services.  Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.\n\nConclusion\nSo, adding the -t option to your SSH command is all you need to do to provide Vim with a terminal device that it can use:\nssh -t me@myserver vim\n\n", "Q: Black screens installing 15.10 I'm having some huge problems installing ubuntu 15.10. Here's the story:\n1) I used to have 14.04 on my PC and everything was working very happily. However, yesterday, I got a window proposing me to update to 15.04; during the usual update procedure I got plenty of error messages saying many packages couldn't be properly configured. At the end the installer said the update failed and tried to reset to old configuration. But something must have gone wrong, since I couldn't restart the pc. Thus, I decided to erase and install directly the latest version.\n2) To backup I used an old 13.04 live CD and everything worked.\n3) Meanwhile I created a 15.10 live USB. When I tried it, it couldn't create a live desktop, freezing on a black screen after the ubuntu logo. Also selecting \"install\" brought to a freeze immediately after the install window appeared.\n4) I read for some hardware one needs to set \"nomodeset\" in grub and I did it. This indeed allowed me to begin the installation procedure; however, it freezed trying to connect to WiFi.\n5) I connected to WiFi using the live 15.10 and launched the install afterwards. Everything worked.\n6) However, when rebooting I get again a black screen after the ubuntu logo. Setting nomodeset in grub seems to be of no help now. I also tried to add nomodeset in /etc/default/grub in recovery mode, but the file opens in read-only mode with nano, so I cannot edit it\nDo you have any suggestions?\nMany thanks\n\nA: Boot into recovery mode by selecting Advanced options for Ubuntu in the boot menu and then the option that has appended recovery menu to the latest kernel version string. If the Grub menu does not appear when booting, press Shift or Esc while booting.\nYou will be presented with several options as seen below:\n\nChoose the Enable networking option (you need a wired connection at this point). After that is finished choose the option to Drop into root shell prompt.

Copy the folder on the laptop using the live CD and then in the recovery mode root shell do:\n$ cd /path/to/driver.run\n$ chmod +x amd-driver-installer-XX.XXX-x86.x86_64.run\n$ ./amd-driver-installer-XX.XXX-x86.x86_64.run\n$ amdconfig --initial\n$ reboot\n\nYou should be able to boot into Ubuntu normally now.\nNOTE: for nVidia systems use the following commands after dropping into root shell:\n$ ubuntu-drivers devices\n== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.4/0000:03:00.0 ==\nmodel    : GM107M [GeForce GTX 960M]\nmodalias : pci:v000010DEd0000139Bsv00001028sd000006E1bc03sc02i00\nvendor   : NVIDIA Corporation\ndriver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin\ndriver   : nvidia-352-updates - distro non-free\ndriver   : nvidia-352 - distro non-free recommended\n\n$ apt-get install nvidia-352  # the number must match the version you got above\n$ nvidia-xconfig\n$ reboot\n\n", "Q: Merging two partitions (Gparted) - Error: Cannot delete partition Apparently, during the installation of Ubuntu 14.04, it did not delete an existing partition.

My Lenovo E531 have dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04. The problem is, that grub just disappear. I install Ubuntu normally and use it normally. I don't install nothing yet. Today I turn on the Laptop and appears a screen that show \"Grub rescue>\". So I turned it off and boot from \"Boot-Repair-Disk\" tool.\nThis tool didn't offer the repair option, only the Create a Bootinfo summary option.\nHere is the summary -> http://paste.ubuntu.com/14398335/\nHow can I fix it?\nThank you.\n\nA: It looks like your disk is badly damaged. Your partition table appears to be intact and is sensible, but Boot Info Script says the partitions all contain unknown filesystems. This suggests that either the partition table information is wrong or the filesystems have all been damaged by something -- improper use of low-level commands like dd, a malicious virus, a failing disk, etc.\nRecovery might be possible, but will require considerable expertise. If the partition table is damaged, TestDisk might be able to recover the partitions, but I don't think that's the problem. If I'm right in this, your best bet is likely to be to wipe everything and recover it all from a backup. You do have a backup, right? If not, you might be able to pull your important files off the disk with PhotoRec or something similar, but you'll need a clean disk for recovery. The last I checked, PhotoRec did a poor job of recovering filenames, so you might end up spending a lot of time reviewing and renaming files. Some Windows-specific tools supposedly do a better job recovering filenames, but I have no specific pointers.\nIn case your disk is failing, you might want to run a SMART examination of the disk before you restore data to it. If the disk is physically failing, there's no point in trying to re-install to it, since you'll just hit problems right away.\n\nA: click this link:\nhttps://arisantos.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/troubleshooting-kendala-booting-di-ubuntu-14-04-dan-muncul-grub-rescue/\nmay be your solution :)\n", "Q: Fast switch between three keyboard layouts - from Unity DE to Gnome Shell I use ubuntu 15.10 and have 3 keyboard languages layout.

From a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rtlwifi-new-dkms linux-firmware\n\nReboot and let us hear your report.\nPlease check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\n", "Q: Ext4 partition problems I have an 1.5tb external hdd. Yesterday morning it worked well.  The system accidentally freezed, and i restarted the system and i cant mount the partition. \nI removed the hdd from the cage, and used ddrescue to copy the partition image into a file.. \nThe copy was successfull without any errors, so the hardware seems ok. \nBut i cant mount, the e2fsck freezes as well. If i start, eats some cpu for 1-2 seconds then stops working. \nWhat can i do ? I've read lot of threads, but i havent found anything about this problem. \nIf nothing will work, is there any way to rescue few directories ? It would be very very important. At christmas night my main hdd damaged, this hdd was my backup disc. I bought spare hdd  thats why i started to copy files from this disc when this happened, so i dont have any backups. \n\nA: Possibly the problem was with the jorunalling fs, and fsck and the mount cannot handle the problem well. So i mounted the fs with the following mount flags: \n-t ext4 -o ro,noload. \nThis worked for me well. \n", "Q: external 3TB USB disc will not stay powered off Running Ubuntu desktop 14.04, and having problems powering down an external USB 3TB drive. \nhdparm -y /dev/disk/by-uuid/736gyh3juhg64 doesnt work because of \nG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]: error\nI did manage to find a workaround using sudo sg_start --stop /dev/sdc and this seemed to work for a while, but today I noticed that the drive immediately mounted & powered back up again immediately after being shut down. \nI attempted to power off the drive using the gnome-disk-utility, and the same thing happens: the drive immediately powers back on again after being shut down.

Now I'm warned I run out of space in the /var partition. Looking there in I find 3 huge files: kern.log, syslog and ufw.log, each 1.2GB. How do I force some existing routine (if there is one) to anticipate the scheduled job of cleaning/compressing/or-whatever the logs?\nThank you\n\nA: Take a look @ logrotate package, you can see a tutorial on this page\nyou could either\n\n\n*\n\n*Lower the level of logging of your firewall: modify the LOGLEVEL directive into the /etc/ufw/ufw.conf file to one of 'off', 'low', 'medium', 'high' and sudo service ufw restart\n\n*reconfigure your firewall so that it logs in another part where you have more space\n\n*configure logrotate to rotate the logs more frequently instead of being into /etc/cron.daily/logrotate for example into /etc/cron.hourly/logrotate (see this post) \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ln -s /etc/cron.daily/logrotate /etc/cron.hourly/logrotate\n\n*Modify the /etc/logrotate.d/ufw file according to this post to manage the size of rotation and man logrotate for more configuration options. It could be that your file is not rotated because of file size which is not setted, by default the size directive is not setted into the  /etc/logrotate.d/ufw file so it is only rotated weekly according to the configuration file directive. So changing it putting a size directive (for example size 300M) will do what you expect maybe. Please note: If the size directive is used, logrotate will ignore the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly directives. If you want logrotate to consider both log size AND timestamp, the minsize directive should be used. \n\n*Run manually if you want the logrotate job to test it with sudo /etc/cron.daily/logrotate\n\n*Check the logrotate jobs into the /var/lib/logrotate/status file (see this post) \n\n\n*If you don't want ufw to log into your kern.log check this post\n\nA: I just deleted the log and posted a bug : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/logrotate/+bug/1530904\nFor kern.log and syslog I hope the night will help.\n", "Q: Frequent 2 minutes pauses on web browser requests A few days ago I did a clean install of Ubuntu (15.10), and applied all updates. Everything seems to be fine, except an annoying issue with web browsing. I've seen the same issue in both Chromium and Firefox.\nFrequently (roughly every 5-10 minutes), I request a page (via a link, or bookmark, or directly typing the URL) and the browser just pauses on that request. It doesn't hang - the browser is still fully responsive - just the request does nothing. With the developer tools open, I see the request appear as a row in the Network tab, but nothing happens. 2 minutes later, the request times-out, and the browser shows me its own error page, then (in the case of Chromium) it automatically refreshes the page and everything works fine.\nIf I manually refresh during the 2 minute period, I seem to just get another request that pauses similarly, although I have a feeling that if I refresh towards the end of the 2 minutes, it does seem to work; I haven't established a definite time period after which it always starts working.\nThe same thing seems to happen for all sites (at least, all those I've encountered during normal browsing - Google, Gmail, Facebook, this site, Amazon and various other online shops), I haven't tried with anything hosted locally, because I'm still setting up the box, so don't have anything running locally to test.\nDuring the 2 minute pause, I find the same problem in other tabs, windows, and both browsers, but get normal responses when I ping the site(s) I'm waiting for, or any other site.\nI don't think it's an issue on my home network, because 2 Macs and various mobile devices don't experience the same issue, although I do only have a cheap, ISP-provided router, so it is a possibility. I see the same symptoms on both a wired and a wireless connection.\nFinally, I think the same symptoms are occurring for AJAX requests as well as those directly initiated by me - if I leave the developer tools open with an AJAX-heavy page (Facebook, for example), I see requests timing-out then working properly, just as I do when I click a link.\nAlthough I'm a relatively comfortable user of Ubuntu, I'm far from any kind of Linux expert, so not really sure what to look at next to help me diagnose this issue. I appreciate that what I've included here probably isn't enough to get a simple answer, but I'd certainly appreciate pointers for anything else I can test, to get more useful information.\n\nA: I figured out a resolution, although not an explanation - taking out the ethernet cable made the problem go away. I'm a bit confused, because even when I was connected wirelessly, and could see traffic using the wifi connection, just having the cable plugged in caused this problem. If anyone has a suggestion for what that might be, I'd be keen to hear it, but for now, not using a wired connection is good enough for me.\n", "Q: Using Virtualbox, with Ubuntu as host, do I have to re-install Windows as the guest? I am running dual boot, so I have both Windows and Ubuntu.\n\nA: When you already have Windows installed on your hard disk, usually there is no need to install it in VirtualBox. The only advantage to additionally create a Windows VM in VirtualBox is to launch Windows from within the running Ubuntu system ... but does this really make any sense at all ... ?\nIn case you you decide to only use Ubuntu and wipe Windows from the hard disk - it would make more sense to create a Windows VM in VirtualBox for occasionally using Windows as a guest OS.\n", "Q: How do I delete / remove a file I am a beginner with Linux / Ubuntu, and I'm trying to remove / delete a file.\nThe specific is a wallet I created in Electrum to import a paper wallet; I can see the wallet in the file list but can't delete it.\nI do understand that one uses the rm command in the Terminal, but I am not sure how to word the actual command. The file I'm trying to delete is home/duncan/.electrum/wallets/import key, but but if I type that into the Terminal it is rejected - i.e. \nrm home/duncan/.electrum/wallets/importkey\n\nis rejected.\n\nA: Mind the space! That tells \"rm\" there will be a 2nd file after the 1st one. \nAnd since it is 1 file you need to take care of the space. What will work:\nrm /home/duncan/.electrum/wallets/\"import key\"\n\nor\nrm /home/duncan/.electrum/wallets/import\\ key\n\nby \"escaping\" the space or\nrm /home/duncan/.electrum/wallets/import{tab}\n\n(keep hitting tab til it shows the file name).\n/home/duncan can be abbreviated by ~ (ie. rm ~/.electrum/wallets/\"import key\") \n\nThe file name was Import_keys. So the shorthand version for Duncan: \nrm ~/.electrum/wallets/Import_keys\n\nNo need for \"'s. The capital I probably was the culprit.\n", "Q: Unable to restart apache2 after installing SSL certificate I installed an SSL certificate from Comodo.

I am using a Ubuntu 15.10 machine and everything was just fine until yesterday..when I decided it might be cool to run kde on my system, so I installed plasma and that's when things started to get bad.I logged in to plasma, and tried to play a video using vlc, and I there was something weird.Even in fullscreen, the video occupied only about a quarter of the screen, and I was unable to fix it.So I logged out of plasma and back to unity, and the problem was still there.Since then I have tried many possible solutions without avail.I tried reinstalling vlc,using synaptic to remove vlc and reinstall, using purge to remove vlc, and finally that issue is gone but there is new one.

I'm keep digging for a solution for last few days but could not get any solution so far. I use WD Elements 2TB external USB HDD in USB 3.0 port for maximum optimization but the problem is that even after I safely remove from my file manager or Unity Dash it keeps rotating which I can feel very clearly.

What 'Safe to remove' means that nothing needs to be or is being  written to the drive.  The drive itself needs to slow down from 5200rpm to zero,  This process, obviously,  needs to happen  only after the drive itself finishes ITS read/write cycle.\nIn other words it is safe to immediately  remove the external drive without creating problems,  but being the self aware paranoid  that I am,  I wait the extra few seconds before removal.

Please let me know what shoud I do to fix this.\n\nA: Have you tried to change the setting/configuration of pulseaudio?

Run:\nnano $HOME/.bashrc\n\nGo to the end of the file, create a new line and write:\nexport mgf=\"/media/prasanth/01D0F888E7BC91801/github projects\"\n\nHit Ctrl+O and ENTER to save the file. Hit Ctrl+X to exit. Now log out and log in. When youn open a terminal (running bash) you can run cd \"$mgf\" to change to your directory.\n\nA: It seems like you're looking for cdargs.\nIt provides bookmarks for the cd command.\nYou can add a bookmark by executing mark NAME in the directory that is bookmarked. Then you can change to this directory from anywhere using cv NAME with NAME being the name of the bookmark.\n\nA: You could have a look at autojump.\nIt basically learns as you use cd by building a database of folders you visit and assigning weights to them: the more you visit a folder, the higher it is in the database.\nThen, after you cd a few times to a directory (even once suffices):\ncd /media/prasanth/01D0F888E7BC91801/github projects\n\nyou can jump there by using the j command:\nj proj\n\nYou can use any part of the directory name as an argument to the j command and it will jump to the first entry that matches, so that's helpful when you don't remember the full path.\nIt has some other capabilities which are pretty neat such as jump to child (jc). I encourage you to inspect it.\n\nA: Bash has a handy little misfeature called CDPATH. When cd foo looks for a relative path, it looks in the current directory by default. By setting CDPATH to a colon-separated list of path prefixes, we can go to that target instead if no match was found. This works similarly to the PATH variable when looking for executable files.\nIn your case, you could export CDPATH=.:/media/prasanth/01D0F888E7BC91801/github/ in your ~/.bashrc, and then execute cd projects/foo from anywhere to get to /media/prasanth/01D0F888E7BC91801/github/projects/foo.\nHowever, this will not work if your current directory contains a matching entry, so this can have some confusing error modes. There are some people that swear by this methods, I myself rather prefer symlinks in the home directory as suggested by Paul Grove.\n\nA: So far two great have been given in other answers, I have one more possibility:\nln -s /media/prasanth/01D0F888E7BC91801/github/projects ~/mygitfiles\n\nWill create a symlink to the long path in your home.\nSymlinks are like shortcuts that point to another file or directory, and most programs will treat them as normal.  you can safely rm the symlink without effecting the path it points to. you can observe where the symlink points to with ls -l.\nYou can use the symlink as if it was a real directory and do cd ~/mygitfiles.\nNote that ~ is simply an alias for your home directory, which might be a sensible place for such a symlink.\nBe aware that using this symlink ultimately effects your current working directory.\nIn the general case I would suggest Nicolas Delvaux, or Eduardo Cola's answer, but using a symlink might be just as - or possibly more useful.\n\nA: I would type\ncd /media/prasanth/01D0F888E7BC91801/github projects #demo-proj\n\nthe first time I run that command. The content after # is a comment.\nThen to call it, I would CtrlR and type in de (a convenient substring of demo-proj), till the previous command comes up.     \n(reverse-i-search)`de': cd /media/prasanth/01D0F888E7BC91801/github projects #demo-proj\n\nI can hit CtrlR again for even-earlier uses.\n\nThis has no need to set/replace permanent aliases. I also do this for long commands or even netstat -tulpn which I find cryptic.\n\nA: You should use aliases. See help alias.\nIn a nutshell, you can define an alias by typing:\nalias whatever=\"cd /media/prasanth/01D0F888E7BC91801/github/projects\"\n\nThen, typing whatever will move you to the defined folder.\nYou can put the alias command in your ~/.bashrc to keep it permanently.\n", "Q: canon LBP6030/6040/6018L how to install the canon LBP6030/6040/6018L on the tosthiba satelit laptop?\ni'm using the ubuntu 14LTS and i can't find a driver for it. \nsorry i'm reading the forums for almost 4 h but i cant find the problem.\nit let's me to recognize the printer as mentioned above only with generic driver.\nrecognizes as canon LBP6030/6040/6018L\nlocation usb://Canon/LBP6030/6040/6018L?serial=0000A1F3K9K3\nmake model: Generic text-only printer\nprinter status : Idle or Idle - File \"/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstocapt3\n\nA: *\n\n*Download Linux driver from official site.\n\n*Execute file located in gzip directory Debian\n", "Q: How can I find the source code for linux commands? I often come across interesting Linux commands that make me wonder; what are these commands actually doing?\nYes, they might be 'force-removing dependencies', 'installing programs' and doing lots of other stuff, but I'd like to know how they're doing it.\nLooking into the source code seems the right thing to do then, but where am I supposed to get it from?\nI suppose they'll be written in C?\nEDIT: I'm not talking about packages installed using apt-get. I'm looking for the source code of linux/unix commands.\n\nA: Syntax: apt-get source command-name\nExample: apt-get source netstat\nIf it cannot find:\nAdd a Source URI to sources.lst\ncat /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb-src http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian lenny main\napt-get update\n\nA: I think you're talking about GNU/Debian commands. Linux does not have commands. Most Linux distributions use GNU utilities (that's why we should call them 'GNU/Linux') and their own commands (such as Debian's APT system). For example, in Ubuntu, commands such as cp, cd, mv are part of the GNU Core Utilities, which are part of the Ubuntu core (base) system. They are represented by the package coreutils. There is an apt-get paramater that you can use to get packages source code: apt-get source. To get coreutils' source code, use sudo apt-get source coreutils. It's important to know that commands are nothing more than binaries placed in the paths of the PATH environment variable. These binaries are usually written in C. Also note that commands from some other Unix-like systems, even though they have the same names, are not from the GNU project and sometimes have different syntax. This is the case with the BSD's (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD) and OSX (based in FreeBSD).\n", "Q: How to change monitor resolution in my case?

How do I do this?\nFor ex. I write a program and i just have a exe file of it this porgram calculate amount of velocity \nIn other program i wanna use velocity that calculated in exe file \nHow can I open exe file in the main body and read velocity from it? \n\nA: Executables don't directly contain the code used to produce them.\nHowever, they can be decompiled, producing equivalent code in a high-level programming language such as Fortran. Unfortunately, this won't usually be very legible. Expect random variable names and terrible spaghetti code.\nSearching the web for \"Fortran compiler\" finds a few applications, however I haven't tested any of those.\n", "Q: SMB encryption for connection from internet I use Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS with all updates and use built-in Samba 4.1.6. Because I use Samba from internet, I set smb encrypt = mandatory. This is fine, works great (even if I see login name when I listen the communication, but password and all data is encrypted).\nBut because I have slow comp (Atom D330), maximum speed is around 8-9 MB/s. When I turn off smb encryption, speed is about 60-70 MB/s.\nIs there any option how to encrypt all connections from the internet, but don't encrypt connection from local network (192.168.88.0/24)? Encryption on the local network is useless and greatly reduce the speed.\n\nA: One way is to disable encryption, as well as direct access from the Internet, and use a VPN instead.  Another is to set up a second instance of samba ( on an alternate port ) just for serving access from the Internet and configure that one to require encryption, but not the local instance.\n", "Q: Can't install VLC Ubuntu 14.04 because of dependency issues I am trying to install VLC on my Ubuntu server.

You should download the 32Bit version or buy a new CPU. If you are having a 64Bit CPU but running it inside a virtual machine make sure you have victimisation enabled in the BIOS\n\nA: If you are using virtualization software, like VirtualBox or VMware Player, you'll need to change the OS version for the VM to its 64-bit equivalent. VMware Player is especially bad at this, because the 32-bit version just has the name of the OS, like \"Ubuntu\" and the 64-bit version actually says \"Ubuntu 64-bit\".\nYou should probably run the 64-bit version of the OS on a 64-bit CPU, even if you are running less than 4 GB of memory.

What do Kernel command line parameters (also also known as boot options) mean?\nWhen you go to Ubuntu (or better, GRUB) options, you have things like nomodeset, quiet and splash. What do these options mean?\nI am also interested in other parameters and would be interested to see descriptions of any kernel parameter (like acpi), but these are not essential. \n\nA: These are instructions passed to the kernel during the boot time. In Ubuntu, they are managed by the GNU GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader).\n\n\n*\n\n*quiet - this option tells the kernel to NOT produce any output (a.k.a. Non verbose mode). If you boot without this option, you'll see lots of kernel messages such as drivers/modules activations, filesystem checks and errors. Not having the quiet parameter may be useful when you need to find an error.\n\n*splash - this option is used to start an eye-candy \"loading\" screen while all the core parts of the system are loaded in the background. If you disable it and have quiet enable you'll get a blank screen.\n\n*nomodeset - tells the kernel to not start video drivers until the system is up and running.\nThere are lots of other boot parameters, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*3 - starts the system in runlevel 3 (default is 5). If you append this parameter, you will be dropped in a command line environment (runlevel 5 is needed for a GUI).\n\n*init - indicates the location of the \"init\" script. This script is the first process started in an Unix-like system, and is responsible for start all other processes. Syntax: init=/path/to/script\n\nA: These are not \"Ubuntu boot options\". They are \"kernel boot options\".\nIt is not possible to describe all kernel boot options in one answer. Many kernel modules have some kind of options that can be used in grub.\nYou can easily find what nomodeset does.\nOther options can be found too.\n\nA: Unlike Microsoft Windows where the laptop hardware manufacturer (OEM) tests viability of the OS for the hardware, Ubuntu offers these OS kernel flags to allow end users to tweak how the OS interacts with the hardware.  \nDuring Ubuntu install various scripts are run to probe your hardware to identify how best to configure the OS.  Example : when that automated decision is insufficient the laptop may boot up with a blank screen, so these flags enable the end user to manually do the tweak to correct the OS config to better match your hardware.\n\nA: Sorry but you can check that \"splash\" is NOT a kernel options in the sense that you can see, it is not listed as kernel parameter in the list.\nI imagine that is due to the fact that \"splash\" and \"nosplash\" are read by Plymuth, not by the kernel itself, but I am not sure about it.\nAnd also note that \"nosplash\" is different from just deleting the option \"splash\".\nThe option \"nosplash\" saved my life with an Intel integrated video that after an update (Ubuntu 20.04) worked only in recovery mode and deleting \"splash\" just did not worked at all...\nThose parameter are unfortunately undocumented...\n\nA: From this question, about nomodeset:\n\nThe newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the\n  kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock rates\n  and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than in\n  the X driver when the X server starts.. This makes it possible to have\n  high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker free\n  transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on some\n  cards this doesn't work properly and you end up with a black screen.\n  Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video\n  drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\n\nFrom Unix & Linux, on quiet splash:\n\nThe splash (which eventually ends up in your /boot/grub/grub.cfg )\n  causes the splash screen to be shown.\nAt the same time you want the boot process to be quiet, as otherwise\n  all kinds of messages would disrupt that splash screen.\nAlthough specified in GRUB these are kernel parameters influencing the\n  loading of the kernel or its modules, not something that changes GRUB\n  behaviour. The significant part from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT is\n  CMDLINE_LINUX\n\nThis answer covers acpi, noapic and nolapic:\n\nIn general, such boot parameters are not needed unless there is a\n  problem with your BIOS and how it handles these standards, or it just\n  might be old enough where these standards were not fully implemented\n  properly.\nACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard for\n  handling power management. Older systems may not support ACPI full, so\n  sometimes it helps to give the kernel a hint to not use it. \"acpi=off\"\nAPIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is a kind of feature\n  found on newer systems. The \"local\" version is called \"LAPIC\". What\n  this controller can do is be set up to generate and handle interrupts,\n  a signal the hardware uses to pass messages. Again, some\n  implementations of APIC can have problems on older system, and so it\n  is useful to disable it. \"noapic\" and \"nolapic\".\nSometimes the APIC is working, but it slows things down by getting in\n  the middle of messages being passed around. This can mess with audio\n  and video processing, for example. Folks might disable it for that\n  reason as well.\n\nAdditional parameters can be found here.\n\nA: Although, only some of them are commonly used/changed in grub configuration, there are far more boot parameters.\nFor a full list, see the official documentation: The kernel’s command-line parameters\n\n", "Q: Simplest way to get bootable ISO with installed/persistent Ubuntu? Sometimes I need to boot specially setuped Ubuntu and I think that better way to do this - load iso from hdd. I already know how to boot from iso, but what is the simplest way to get iso that can save my setting for next boot, for example installation of new software? Strange that we can not download such image from official Ubuntu download page, as VM-images too. I found nothing in DuckDuckGo about such type of iso.\n\nA: Just to be clear, you want to boot from an ISO residing on your hard drive? You are opposed to booting from a USB stick? If you're willing to go the USb route, you have MKUSB, which is very user-friendly. I ended up using MKUSB, after having some problems with some of the popular live USB installer apps.\nIf you want to boot (with persistence) from an ISO on your HDD, without installing your Linux distro on the HDD, there is no short answer I can give, though more experienced users might. Therefore I'll take the liberty to point to this link from the Linux Mint forums, but it applies to Ubuntu as well.\nhttp://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/1849\nOne more thing, you can install an extra distro in another partition(s). It seeems to me to be the most logical way, unless you want a portable Linux, but then USB is the way to go, in my opinion.\n", "Q: iam not able to install java and android studio dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/gconf-service_3.2.6-3_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gconf/gconfd-2', which is also in package gconf-service-backend 3.2.6-0ubuntu2\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/gconf-service_3.2.6-3_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: For Java:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*Open Terminal. \n\n\n*\n\n*Type in sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk openjdk-7-jre\nFor Android Studio:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo add-apt-repository ppa: paolorotolo / android-studio\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo apt-get update\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install android-studio\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the repository you installed it in and right click, then select \"Run in Terminal\".\n\n\n\nYou may need to connect the jdk to Android Studio, depending on which version, and if you get an error then try installing OracleJDK instead.\n", "Q: How to fix hdajackretask error tee: /sys/class/sound/hwC0D0/reconfig I tried using hdajackretask to make my mic jack act as another headphone jack, but when I hit apply it would say \ntee: /sys/class/sound/hwC0D0/reconfig \n\nand then wouldn't work.\n\nA: I was able to fix it by making the changes (Microphone→Headphones, Channel 3→1) and then setting it as a boot setting.

If I want to alias a executable file in /usr/local/bin , Is there a correct way to make such an alias? and how can I make one? Softlink? Hardlink? Something else?\nFor example, when I \napt-get install vim;\n\nAptitude will alias /usr/local/bin/vi as /usr/local/bin/vim (if I recall correctly)\n\nA: Technically speaking, there is a way to \"alias\" default apps. What you are encountering with sudo apt-get install vim is Debian Alternatives System. \nBasically , that system has list of default apps in /etc/alternatives/ folder, which are symlinks to whatever default app you have. Before installing vim you have vim.tiny, so vi gets symlinked to /etc/alternatives/vi , which then is symlinked to /usr/bin/vim.tiny. Once you get the actual vim, those symlinks all get updated to ultimately point to vim. \nOf course there is manual way through sudo update-alternatives --config vi. And there of course is nothing stopping you from creating your own symlinks there. However for programs that aren't going to have many many different implementations, like screen for example, you could just leave them alone. Provided that /usr/bin is in your $PATH variable (which it should always be), you can just type in myappname and it will run.\n\nA: Whatever you do, don't hard link.\nHard links lead to confusing issues when, for example, you try to delete the file, because if you don't remember to delete it twice it's still there.\nIn the case of a program, this can lead to hard-to-debug behaviour, because the program may still be found at the hard link location. Depending on the content of the PATH environment variable, it could be executed under different circumstances to what is the case now.\nHard links are like gotos in programming: a hangover from an older time, now considered harmful.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04 with UEFI I'm trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my new Odys Trendbook 12. It came with Win 10 pre-installed.\nMy problem is that I don't have the option to disable Secure Boot in the UEFI Settings. I created a bootable Ubuntu USB, and when I choose to boot Ubuntu via EFI I get following error message:\nubuntu/winboot/wubildr.mbr is missing or corrupted\n\nI read that WUBI is incompatible with EFI, but I also read of people who got it to run properly with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled.\nIs there a way to create a bootable USB drive with Ubuntu that works with Secure Boot?\n\nA: Older versions of Ubuntu are less likely to be UEFI-compatible. I can tell you that I installed Ubuntu 15.10 via bootable USB on my new Win10 computer last night without having to tinker with UEFI settings. You can try changing the boot order in your bios so that the computer will try booting from USB first. It might say \"USB Flash\" or \"USB CD\"\n", "Q: Problem with nVidia GPU, not working lightdm I'm trying all day to get my nVidia GT650M working, but without success.

Hopefully your problems get solved soon!\n\nA: A local AskUbuntu user, Pilot6, provided a PPA (ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi) containing the required drivers to ensure that the RTL8723 chipset works with your machine.\nEssentially, you need to add this PPA to your system:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi && sudo apt update\n\nNext, install the appropriate DKMS modules and drivers to your system:\nsudo apt install rtlwifi-new-dkms linux-firmware rtl8723au-bt-dkms\n\nThese two commands (combined) will install the required drivers to your system and kernel. Additionally, this will work after any kernel update, due to the nature of DKMS.\nFurthermore, you are also installing linux-firmware, which allows for some (better) firmware support for similarly quirky devices.\n\nIf you would rather compile from source, you can see this answer, which also includes (further) PPA information.

The line is split into fields as with word\n    splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME, the second\n    word to the second NAME, and so on, with any leftover words assigned to\n    the last NAME.  Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word\n    delimiters.\n\nSo read willl read one line from STDIN and split it on the characters contained in $IFS, assigning each field to each NAME and potential excessive fields to the last NAME.\n$IFS by default contains a space, a tabulation and a newline, so by default read will split its input each time a space or a tabulation is found (the newline by default is used by read to split records, so it will be used to split records rather then to split fields, even if a newline is contained in $IFS).\nSo you should set $IFS based on how you want to split the input.\nAssuming that you want to store space-separated values (and hence splitting the input on the characters contained in $IFS by default is fine), you should do something like this:\nread a b c\necho $a $b $c\n\n$ read a b c\naaa bbb ccc\n$ echo $a $b $c\naaa bbb ccc\n$ echo $a\naaa\n$ echo $b\nbbb\n$ echo $c\nccc\n\nIf you want to store e.g. comma-separated values, set $IFS to , for the scope of read's execution:\nIFS=, read a b c\necho $a $b $c\n\n$ IFS=, read a b c\naaa,bbb,ccc\n$ echo $a $b $c\naaa bbb ccc\n$ echo $a\naaa\n$ echo $b\nbbb\n$ echo $c\nccc\n\nIf you want to store newline-separated values (or if you want to input each value separating it from the next one using an ENTER keystroke for that matter), you'll have to read the input three times:\nread a\nread b\nread c\necho $a $b $c\n\n$ read a\naaa\n$ read b\nbbb\n$ read c\nccc\n$ echo $a $b $c\naaa bbb ccc\n$ echo $a\naaa\n$ echo $b\nbbb\n$ echo $c\nccc\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS IP address nonexistent I am a complete beginner when trying to set up a web server.

I've found a lot of helpful information on running Ubuntu on a Macbook Pro from 2006.  This is the 1.1 macbook pro, and I can't see any tutorials that use a Macbook Pro this old.  \nI have installed refit and burned my start up disk, but I have had a hard time running the disk on startup.  I am given about 7 choices including the mac and Ubuntu OS.  When I choose Ubuntu and begin start up I have a choose cd-rom screen, and my keyboard is locked.  I have seen forum posts of this but with no solution. \nDid I burn my start up disk incorrectly, or can a Mac this old not run Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, installing Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS on a MacBook Pro (2006) works out of the box.\nI have not been able to make the computer boot from USB-stick, but if you have a burnable CD or DVD available you can easily get it done.\nIf you have a burnable CD available with room for 700MB data, use the Network installer (mini.iso).\nIf you have a burnable DVD available you can use the standard 16.04.2 LTS desktop iso.\nNOTE that this computer has a 32-bit CPU, so you must select the i386 and not the amd64 images.\nOnce you have your CD/DVD ready restart/turn on your computer, press and hold the C-key until you see the Ubuntu installer boot-menu.\n\nA: This site indicates there is likely no known version of Ubuntu that works on a MacBook Pro 1.1:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro\nAlbeit, that is not directly stated.  I would be more accurate to say \"there are no known Wiki's that tell you how to install a particular version of Ubuntu on a MacBook Pro 1.1\"\nI have a MacBook Pro 5.1 and I have had success installing Linux Mint 17 Xfce.  The Xfce desktop works better for my mac than the other desktops.\nI believe Linux Mint 13 is a fairly stable OS for older computers - you might want to try that one out.\nI did not use rEFIt or rEFInd.\nWhen you boot from the DVD, there is a \"Window\" option and an \"EFI\" option.  If you have an EFI based system (and not a BIOS based system), use the EFI boot.  My mac required the EFI boot.\nAnother error I experienced when booting required me to add \"nomodeset\" to the grub boot command.  (I suspect this is the point where you \"choose Ubuntu and begin start up I have a choose cd-rom screen, and my keyboard is locked.\")  To add nomodeset, press the \"e\" key when you see the grub screen & your desired boot option is highlighted - this will take you to a screen with the boot commands behind that option.  Find the line (probably second from the last line) that contains \"quite splash --\" and modify it to read \"quiet splash nomodeset --\".  You can tinker with deleting the word quiet and/or splash, but leaving them in generally works best for me.\nI actually saved all of my steps for installing Linux Mint 17 Xfce on my MacBook Pro 5.1 in an Excel sheet.  If what I gave you is fruitful, I can post everything else I did.  It might take a few days for me to do that though.\n\nA: I was able to install Lubuntu 15.10 on my 2006 Core Duo model, though not without some problems. Nothing fatal, but some pretty major annoyances. So I don't recommend this route if you can get rEFInd/rEFIt to work at all, but here's what I did. \nWith Boot Camp, I repartitioned the drive, put in an XP disk I had laying around, then hard reset the laptop once the installer was running. Then I held down Alt on startup, ejected the XP disk, and put in my Lubuntu disk and chose the \"windows\" option in the alt menu. \nLubuntu is running fine now (in legacy BIOS mode) and I even found out the battery wasn't dead after all! \nAgain, this is a stupid method, so I'd really consider it a last resort. But I thought you might like to know Ubuntu/Lubuntu will at least run on one of these machines. Happy computing! \n", "Q: Bluetooth on laptop doesnt work.

Please be gentle ;)\nI decided that whatever the default temperature thresholds at which i8kmon sets the fan speeds were inadequate. I would seem to kick the fan on under load, and then never shut off (probably because the lower threshold temperature is set too low?).\nSo I set off creating the custom config file (as described in the i8kmon manpages) in /etc/default/i8kmon. The contents of the file were exactly this:\nset config(0) {{0 0}  \"-\"1  60  \"-\"1  65}\nset config(1) {{1 0}  50  70  55  75}\nset config(2) {{1 1}  60  80  65  85}\nset config(3) {{2 2}  70 128  75 128}\n\nThis however, is not seemed to be liked by i8kmon, as it no longer works after placing the config file.

(Note that it was copy-pasted verbatim into the config file).\nAlso would be interesting to note this; that I have successfully gotten this working in Fedora 23 (albeit the work was of a more manual nature). The key differences (that I can recall) are that 1), the file is placed in /etc/i8kmon.conf, rather than /etc/default/i8kmon (notice no .conf here in  Ubuntu for some reason), and 2), the fedora manpage for i8kmon doesn't call for the weird quotation marks around the dashes.\nAny thoughts on this?\n\nA: You should place the configuration file in \n/etc/i8kmon.conf instead of /etc/default/i8kmon.

Any issues there?\n\nA: First off the output from ddrescue should be viewable, and you should see the numbers steadily rise.\nThere are a large number of factors that will determine how long 2TB will take to process, but the ddrescue command should show a current and average rate in kB/s which can be used to calculate how long you should expect to wait.\nIt's been a long time since I've used ddrescue, but I recall that you should specify a mapfile.  From the manual:\nThe format for running ddrescue is:\n\n ddrescue [options] infile outfile [mapfile]\n\n infile and outfile may be files, devices or partitions. mapfile is a regular file and must be placed in an existing directory. If mapfile does not exist, ddrescue will create it.\n\n Always use a mapfile unless you know you won't need it. Without a mapfile, ddrescue can't resume a rescue, only reinitiate it.\n\nIf you used a mapfile, and you are worried for whatever reason you can safely interrupt the process, (ctl-c or kill will work) and then start the process again, carrying on from where you left off.\n", "Q: How do I change LAN settings in Ubuntu 15.04?

The root directory is indicated by / and contains the other directories within it.\nThis also contains a directory called home, which lists the only user on my system, sridhar.\nNow there is another directory under / called the root folder directory (not same as / I understand) which I cannot open.\nApparently that contains the home directory of the Super User.\nSince there is only 1 user in my system, does that mean the contents of the home/sridhar folder same as the /root folder? What does the /root folder contain?\n\nA: No. You actually have two users: sridhar AND root. The /root folder is the super user's home directory. If you log in as root (this is not possible in Ubuntu by default) and use your programs, the configurations made by the super user will be stored in /root. If you use wine, for example, a wine prefix will be created under /root. So no, the contents from your home directory and /root directory are not the same.\n\nA: On GNU/Linux there is the standard root user, which always exists, this is different from your user account that you created when you installed Ubuntu.\nYour user's home will be in /home/sridhar.  The root user's home will be /root\nAside from your user, and the root user there are a great number of other system users too, but these are used to run various background services used by the system only.\nIf you are familiar with windows the root user is very similar to the Administrator account, it's always there, as a fallback, but in general should only be used when you have to, 99% of the time you should use your regular user account.\n--edit\n\nWhy do I use sudo every time I install a program?\n\nOnly the root user has access to the whole filesystem, which is needed when installing new software into the root (/) filesystem.\n\nOnly the root user can install programs and updates??\n\nA regular login user usually only has access to his or her home directory, this prevents the user or a program run by the user from accessing important system files.\n\nIf I understand correctly I can never actually login as root.. Only as a user right\n\nYou can login as root, sudo -s or sudo su - do this providing a root shell, additionally you could set the root password: sudo passwd root, and then you could log in as root like a normal user - don't do this!\n\nThen why is there a home for the root user?\n\nThe root user still needs a home, this is where software looks for config files related to the user's preferences.  when you use sudo su - and then run a program, if that program needs a config file, it will likely look in the root users home directory.\n--edit again\nA final note, the root user can access EVERYTHING, and should not be used for general day to day tasks.  If a regular user account is compromised (say a bug in a webbrowser allows an attacker to run code on your machine), then only data in your user directory will be effected, and as a whole the system will be fine, and other users will be fine.\nIf you we're running your webbrowser as root and an attacker got in, they would be running code as the root user and have access to anything and everything.\n\nA: /root\n\nIs the root users home directory, it is not the same as /home/sridhar. The root user has no password set on Ubuntu and you are discouraged from using the root user in preference of the sudo command which allows you to run programs as a super user. \nYou can in fact use sudo su - to switch to the root user and then use ls /root to peek inside, but you should really use sudo ls /root instead. You will probably be disappointed as there is nothing in there.\n\nA: The /home/<username> directory is the home directory of your user account, and the directory you will use as your home directory.\n/root is the home directory of the \"root\" account, and there is rarely a need to use it.\nWhat is the root account?\nThe root account is a special account on the system that has all superuser privileges.  It's never intended for regular use, only when performing maintenance that requires modifying the system.\nOn Ubuntu, superuser access is more commonly gained using the sudo command instead of by logging in as the root account.  However, it is still possible to log in as the root account, so the system has to have a directory set aside to be the home directory during the period you are logged in as root.  It doesn't make sense to store any of your files in there.  If you ever use it at all, you could perhaps just use it as a temporary holding place for files you are working on while you are doing things as root.\n", "Q: How to check how long the last uptime if it's not shutdown correctly?

Malware could have infected key operating system services, or downloaded additional services to run on the system, or any thousands of potential additional problem-causing tasks.\nThe tried and true way, unfortunately, to get rid of malware is to rely on backups of your critical data for restoring, and then blow away the system.  From that point, you would then reinstall the OS and packages you need, and then restore critical files from known clean backups.\nThis is, unfortunately, one of the only ways to be absolutely sure that you got rid of the malware and any traces left over of it.

Right now I am windows user but I am thinking of using of ubuntu. So if I install ubuntu do I need to install motherboard and graphic card drivers like windows?\nMy motherboard is Gigabyte B75M-D3V and graphic card is Sapphire Radeon HD6450 (2GB)\n\nA: You do not need to install \"motherboard\" drivers.\nBut you probably may want to install proprietary video drivers from System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers\n\nA: Let me explain some facts about Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux is \"Plug and Play\" in 99% of the cases. Most drivers are present by default in the Linux kernel, and that means you'll rarely need to install any additional drivers (unlike in Windows). For example, if you buy a brand new flash drive you can be pretty sure that you'll connect it in your Linux box and it WILL work.\n\n*The same happens with most hardware. Video cards/GPUs, wireless adapters, bluetooth cards... If you have extremely new hardware, prefer getting a newer Ubuntu version (current is 15.10). The kernel is more up-to-date and new hardware will probably be recognized. If you have older hardware, prefer a LTS version (current is 14.04), which comes with more stable packages and is usually very trusty (get it? Trusty Tahr?).\n\n*Ubuntu comes with an application called \"Additional drivers\". You can use it to easily manage your hardware drivers. Ubuntu automatically selects the open source drivers for your GPU, for example, but you can install proprietary drivers to have better performance, if you want.\n", "Q: Gimp does not respond when I use Cage Transform tool When I use Cage Transform tool and I select the cage, the program works fine.

I installed rEFIt first than rEFInd,\nI'm booting through two consecutive steps:\n-rEFIt that proposes either mac or rEFInd\n-rEFInd that proposes either mac or linux\nI'd like to go only through rEFInd.\nMy mac's / directory shows no EFI files/directory\nMy linux's /boot directory is filed with old kernel version of EFI files (abi,config,memtest,initrd.img,vmlinuz etc..) that I'm not sure to know how to get rid of.\nI tried autoremove with no success.\nThanks for your advices,\nRaphael\n\nA: There are at least three ways to do this, although each has the potential to go awry:\nMethod 1: From OS X\nFrom OS X, you can use bless to set rEFInd as the default boot manager. This process is described in the rEFInd documentation:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#osx\nNote that's the complete manual rEFInd installation process. You really only need steps 1, 2, and 8.\nThe problem with this approach is that, if your rEFIt installation includes rEFItBlesser (as it does by default), it may reset rEFIt as the default boot loader. You can work around this by removing /Library/StartupItems/rEFItBlesser. Alternatively, you can re-install rEFInd in OS X via the refind-install script, which should give you the option of removing rEFItBlesser.\nMethod 2: From Ubuntu\nIn Ubuntu, typing sudo efibootmgr -v will produce a list of boot options. You can then use the -o option to efibootmgr to change the BootOrder line to set rEFInd as the first option. (For instance, you might type sudo efibootmgr -o 0081,0080 to make Boot0081 the default option, with Boot0080 as a secondary boot option. The details of what values you type will vary from one system to another; that's why you start with sudo efibootmgr -v -- that shows you what options exist on your computer.) This will often work on Macs, but Macs are weird, and on some models it might fail. You may also run into the rEFItBlesser problem noted in the previous approach, so you may need to remove rEFItBlesser manually. (Note that re-installing rEFInd in Ubuntu won't remove rEFItBlesser in OS X.)\nMethod 3: Delete rEFIt\nYou can completely delete rEFIt from the computer. It normally installs itself to EFI/refit in OS X, but depending on how you installed it, it may be somewhere else, such as on the ESP. (The ESP is normally not mounted in OS X, but may be mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu.) With rEFIt gone, the computer should boot to its second boot option, which may be rEFInd or OS X. If it starts booting straight to OS X, you'll need to re-install, or at least re-bless, rEFInd. There's a small chance that the computer will refuse to boot at all after you delete rEFIt. If so, holding down the Option key as you start up should produce the Mac's own built-in boot manager, which should enable you to get to OS X and recover.\n\nA: Ok thanks for that very thorough answer. \nFor the record I went for option 3 got rid of every efi files I could find. As expected the refind boot went trash with the refit one.\nI re-installed refind thanks to a live-usb img through linux directly to avoid the SIP issue.\nWorks like a charm.\nRaphael \n", "Q: RAID 5 status = \"Initialize\" I recently built a PC and loaded 14.04 on it. My motherboard (ASRock z97 Extreme 4) has the capability to run a RAID array built into it (pardon my terminology if I'm wrong, I'm not really that good at this stuff). I have a 250GB SSD in slot 0 and five 3TB hard drives in slots 1-5 that I plan to use to store media for a Plex Server.\nWhen the PC is booting, I have the option to go into the RAID configuration utility. I create a RAID 5 Volume and set the 5 hard drives to be disks to be used. After this point, it shows that a RAID volume exists, with the status set to \"Initialize\". It never changes past that point. When viewing the disks after booting up, the 5 hard drives show up individually, but the RAID Volume does not show up.\nAny thoughts? Thanks!\nEdit: all of my hard drives are showing up as being a RAID member. I guess my real question now is how to \"Initialize\" the volume and then mount it?\n\nA: The \"initialize\" message you are seeing is most likely because the RAID 5 array is building right now. It takes up to 24 hours (or longer if your array is in use) to initialize/rebuild your array.\nI have a 7 disk (2TB) Raid 6 that takes nearly 30 hours to rebuild when I swap out a drive. Mind you, it is in use during that time so it takes longer. Your disks are 3TB, and because they are bigger it will take longer.\nA reason that Ubuntu is not seeing the RAID could be because you need to install 'dmraid' first, which enables the system to see the RAID array correctly. \nSee if running this command will help:\n\nsudo apt-get install dmraid\n\nAlso, unless you are trying to setup a dual boot with Windows, I would recommend using 'mdraid' over 'dmraid'.

Now, Cmake will find the pkg-config.\n\nA: Try:\nsudo apt-get install pkg-config\n\n\nA: https://github.com/vitalif/grive2/issues/74\nSOLUTION that worked for me:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall pkg-config cmake-data\n\n", "Q: Newbie, Unable to install scanner Software for Brother MFC L8850CDW?

To run portable applications do not need to have root rights. However, can they harm the system? For example, I heard that there are portable applications for Windows that cause crashes in the system. (Application led to a critical error and the blue screen of death). How things work in Linux? For example, in Ubuntu. Tell me please about it. \n\nA: By not using sudo, you protect most files outside your home folder from being written/removed, and sometimes, read. But remember that anything that's executable may cause harm to you. For instance, I could create a script that removes everything in your home directory without needing root permissions. Or I could create a script that reads your browser's configuration directory and sends me the contents.\nAs on Windows' BSOD issues, poorly written applications may crash on Ubuntu too, but I yet have to hear the first story where such an app without root permissions caused damage to the system.\nThe bottom line is: be careful with everything you download from outside the Ubuntu repositories.\n", "Q: Error: \"The value for the SHELL variable was not found the /etc/shells file\" when running `pkexec` On Ubuntu 14.04, I am getting the error \"The value for the SHELL variable was not found the /etc/shells file\" when running pkexec to run a script.\nMost likely this error started after I removed the fish shell, that was set as my default shell.\nThe content of /etc/shells is:\n\n# /etc/shells: valid login shells\n  /bin/sh\n  /bin/dash\n  /bin/bash\n  /bin/rbash\n\nHow may I fix this?\n\nA: The problem is this one: pkexec is accessing $SHELL to determine which shell to use to evaluate the remainder of the command; since you uninstalled fish but didn't do anything else, $SHELL still contains /usr/bin/fish, but pkexec doesn't deem /usr/bin/fish as a valid shell, since /usr/bin/fish has been removed from /etc/shells.\nYou need to do these two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a new shell for your user, so that the next time the environment is load $SHELL will contain a path to a valid shell. E.g. to set Bash as the new shell for your user (replace user with your user's username):\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash user\n\n\n*Log out / log in to reload the environment so that $SHELL contains the path to the new shell for your user.\n", "Q: projector issues with Ubuntu 15.10 A fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10 on HP Pavilion m6. When I hook up a projector or second monitor to this laptop, the display defaults to the second monitor or projector and shuts down the main display. The only window I can open on the second monitor is the terminal and nautilus. I suspect that other apps are attempting to display on the main screen, but nothing is showing. I cannot adjust the monitor settings using the GUI and I'm not familiar enough with terminal to be able to turn the main display back on. Suggestions?\n\nA: From the command line, try\nunity-control-center\n\nFrom there you want the \"Display\" options. From there you should be able to set up mirrored display, extended display, whatever you like.\nThis launches the usual system settings dialog. Usually this is easy to get to via the Unity launcher in the top left, or from the Super key. Then you would search \"Settings\" or \"Display.\" \n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu 14.04 in Dell Vostro 15 3000 series Laptop with i5 processor Unable to install Ubuntu 14.04 in Dell Vostro 15 3000 series Laptop with i5 processor.Installation gets stuck & small vertical line remains on the screen.Windows 7 got installed successfully but I want it to make dual boot with Ubuntu.Laptop has Ubuntu 14.04 Compatibilty & sticker on it.\n\nA: Every disterbution of linux has differentimages for different processor .So \nfor AMD Processors :-ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64\n&\nfor intel processor:-ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-i3/i586\ndownload accordingly from utorrent\nProcess to dual boot:-\nHere’s the basic process you’ll need to follow:\nInstall Windows First: If you already have Windows installed, that’s fine. If not, be sure to install Windows first, before you install the Linux system. If you install Linux second, it can set up its boot loader properly to happily co-exist with Windows. if you install Windows second, it will ignore Linux, and you’ll have to go through some trouble to get your Linux boot loader working again.\nMake Room for Linux: You’ll need free space on your Windows system drive to install Linux, or possibly a second entirely different hard drive if you have a desktop PC. You’ll usually need to resize your Windows partition to make room for Linux. If you’re installing Windows from scratch, be sure to leave some free space on the drive for Linux. This will save you some time later.\nInstall Linux Second: Choose your Linux distribution and put its installer on a USB drive or DVD. Boot from that drive and install it on your system, making sure you select the option that installs it alongside Windows — don’t tell it to wipe your hard drive. It’ll automatically set up a Grub2 boot loader menu that lets you choose your preferred operating system each time you boot your computer.\nInstall Windows First\nYour PC probably already has Windows installed on it, and that’s fine. If you’re setting up a PC from scratch, be sure to select the “Custom install” option and tell Windows to use only part of the hard drive, leaving some unallocated space left over for Linux. This will save you the trouble of resizing the partition later.\nMake Room For Linux\nYou’ll probably want to resize your Windows system partition to make room for Linux. If you already have some unallocated space or a separate hard drive for Linux, that’s perfect. Otherwise, it’s time to resize that existing Windows partition so you can make space for a new Linux partition.\nYou can do this in several ways. Most Linux installers allow you to resize Windows NTFS partitions, so you can do this during the installation process. However, you may just want to shrink your Windows system partition from within Windows itself to avoid any potential problems.\nTo do so, open the Disk Management utility — press Windows Key + R, type diskmgmt.msc into the Run dialog, and press Enter. Right-click the Windows system partition — that’s likely your C:\\ drive — and select “Shrink Volume.” Shrink it to free up space for your new Linux system.\nInstall Linux Second\nNext, make installation media for your Linux system. You can download an ISO file and burn it to a disk or create a bootable USB drive. Reboot your computer and it should automatically boot from the Linux installation media you’ve inserted. If not, you’ll need to change its boot order or use the UEFI boot menu to boot from a device.\nOn some newer PCs, your PC may refuse to boot from the Linux installation media because Secure Boot is enabled. Many Linux distributions will now boot normally on Secure Boot systems, but not all of them. You may need to disable Secure Boot before installing Linux.\nGo through the installer until you reach an option that asks where (or how) you want to install the Linux distribution. This will look different depending on your Linux distribution, but you want to choose the option that lets you install Linux alongside Windows, or choose a manual partitioning option and create your own partitions. Don’t tell the installer to take over an entire hard drive or replace Windows, as that’ll wipe away your existing Windows system.\nChoosing an Operating System and Customize Grub2.\nOnce you’ve installed Linux, it will install the Grub2 boot loader to your system. Whenever you boot your computer, Grub2 will load first, allowing you to choose which operating system you want to boot — Windows or Linux.\nYou can customize Grub’s options, including which operating system is the default and how long Grub2 waits until it automatically boots that default operating system. Most Linux distributions don’t offer easy Grub2 configuration applications, so you may need to configure the Grub2 boot loader by editing its configuration files.\nYou can use this process to triple or quadruple-boot multiple versions of Linux along with Windows, multiple versions of Windows along with Linux, or multiple versions of each. Just install one after the other, ensuring there’s enough room for a separate partition for each operating system. Be sure to install Windows before you install Linux, too.\n", "Q: Linux screen program behaves strangely when moving cursor up and down while viewing a file I'm trying to use the Linux program Screen to code on my Ubuntu laptop but its behaving really strangely.  When i open a file, the file looks like it should but as I move down to the bottom, brackets appear in strange places.  These brackets seem to match the bracket placement of the line before it.\nHere's a screenshot of my cursor at the top:\nCursor at top\nHere's a screenshot once its reached the bottom:\nCursor at bottom\nNotice all the extra brackets everywhere?  There also seems to be two separate line counters in the bottom right hand corner.\nAnother weird thing is that my cursor is limited in its movements.  ON line 3 my cursor can only go as far as the 1st closed bracket, as if it was on the line above it.\nAnyone have any idea whats going on here?\nEDITS:\nI tried to use tmux but I got the same issue.\nShould also mention I don't have a .screenrc file.\n\nA: I've seen a similar issue on Cygwin, and one work-around is to resize your terminal window after starting screen.\nI don't know why this happens, but screen misreads the number of lines in the terminal on startup.  If you re-size your terminal after that, the issue is corrected for that session.\nIn your screenshots the terminal is maximized.  Quit out of Vim and type the following:\ntput lines\n\nThis will tell you the number of lines screen thinks you have...\nNow reduce the terminal size and re-maximize it, then re-run the command:\ntput lines\n\nAre you getting the same answer?\n\nA: 1. It looks like you're using gnome-terminal. Try using xterm and see if the problem goes away. I'm not saying switch to xterm (okay, I am), but just see if that's where the problem is. If you're already using xterm, try gnome-terminal, or rxvt, or whatever.\n2.

For example, when I hover over Firefox, I get a label next to the icon saying Firefox Web browser, but with sublime text, it says /var/www/html/forum/index.php - Sublime Text (UNREGISTERED). This is strange because this filename is not open in Sublime Text but still displays on the label. How can i reset it so it displays only as Sublime Text again?\nIt even says /var/www/html/forum/index.php - Sublime Text (UNREGISTERED) in the Dash Home\n\nA: Not sure how it could happen, but some process must have either created- or edited the local sublime-text.desktop file.\nHow to solve?\nIf you installed Sublime Text globally (and thus the file /usr/share/applications/sublime-text.desktop exists) simply remove the local one:\nrm ~/.local/share/applications/sublime-text.desktop\n\nand log out/in to make Unity find the global one.\nIf /usr/share/applications/sublime-text.desktop does not exist, open the local one:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/sublime-text.desktop\n\nand look for the first line, starting with Name=.

I contacted Jaybird support and they showed me how to factory reset the headset to wipe all pairing, but adding it back on my system it pairs but no audio controls are present.\nWhen I use the bluetooth manager to set up the device I get a message saying \"Device paired successfully, but failed to connect\". I have it marked as 'trusted' (whatever that means) but it hasn't helped.\nWhen I go through system settings for Bluetooth I see the device, it shows it's paired, but the connection button is ghosted:\n\nSince my trackpad works just fine, I'm not sure this is a BT driver issue, but perhaps an issue with my headset, though the headset is paired with and works fine with the Windows 10 installation on this laptop, and also on my Nexus 6 and a workstation at home which is also dual-booted as Linux/Win10. Jaybird tells me the headset can pair with up to 10 devices so it's not a limitation of pairing too many times.\nEDIT: Jaybird says pairing must use passcode 0000 yet there's on option for that in Ubuntu 15.10 ... I only get options for pairing using a random PIN or not to connect at all. I'm curious if this is the root of the problem, and how I should get the '0000' option back? (it's been there in previous Ubuntu versions)\n\nA: Turns out to be a bug in pulseaudio, not bluez.\nThe accepted answer on this post solved the problem for me:\nPulseAudio can not load bluetooth module 15.10/16.04/16.10\nIt feels like a bit of a hack workaround, but it works.\n", "Q: Change HDMI resolution on Nitrogen6x board with Ubuntu I started working with an Freescale i.MX6Q rev1.2 at 792 MHz a few days ago. I got the Nitrogen6X board with 2GiB DRAM and I am using an Ubuntu image from https://boundarydevices.com/.\nSo I connected a monitor to the HDMI port. The monitor is capable of many resolutions (I want to use the max resolution 1920x1080). The image however has not this resolution.\nI connected the board via serial interface to my laptop und checked the output during the boot process. Here, U-Boot tells me, HDMI is used and resolution is set to 1024x768.\nNo panel detected: default to HDMI\nDisplay: HDMI (1024x768)\n\nI've used google and found some solutions, but they didn't work for me:\n1.)

Specific to Node.js, developers can choose from one of the currently supported releases and get regular automatic updates directly from NodeSource. Node.js versions 6, 8 and 9 are currently available, with the Snap Store being updated within hours, or minutes of a Node.js release.\nNode can be installed with a single command, for example:\nsudo snap install node --classic --channel 9/stable \n\nThe node snap can be accessed by the command node, for example:\n$ node -v  \nv9.9.0\nAn up-to-date version of npm will installed as part of the node snap. npm should be run outside of the node repl, in your normal shell. After installing the node snap run the following command to enable npm update checking:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/your-username/.config\nReplace  your-username in the above command with your own username. Then run npm -v to check if the version of npm is up-to-date. As an example I checked that npm was up-to-date, checked the version of an already installed package named yarn with the command npm list yarn and then updated the existing yarn package to the latest version with the command npm update yarn\nUsers can switch between versions of Node.js at any time without needing to involve additional tools like nvm (Node Version Manager), for example:\nsudo snap refresh node --channel=8/stable\n\nUsers can test bleeding-edge versions of Node.js that can be installed from the latest edge channel which is currently tracking Node.js version 10 development work by switching with:\nsudo snap switch node --edge\n\nThis approach is only recommended for those users who are willing to participate in testing and bug reporting upstream.\n\nInstall Electron\nElectron requires a Node.js version >= 4.5, so if you have installed the node snap package you are ready to install Electron locally; just open the terminal and type:\nnpm install electron --save-dev --save-exact\n\n\nA: I encountered the same problem and I updated npm to the latest version:\n\n$ npm -v\n1.4.21\n$ sudo npm install -g npm\n...\n$ npm -v\n3.5.3\n\n(Weirdly, I had to sudo npm install -g npm twice to get it to work.

The more general question: How do I pass arguments/switches to the client in Network Manager?\nIn order to connect to a Juniper VPN using OpenConnect, I use the following command-line:\nsudo openconnect --juniper -u me vpn.juniper.example.com\nI've installed network-manager-openconnect, but it fails to connect (I get a \"XML response has no \"auth\" node\" message in the log window).\nHow do I configure the vpn client when using Network Manager?\nUpdate\nIt may not be as simple as passing the --juniper switch.  I renamed the client and put a shell script in its place to call the client with the --juniper switch added and saw no difference in the behavior when trying to connect.  So the general question remains: how to configure the client when using Network Manager?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 17.10, it seems to \"just work\" as long as you install not only network-manager-openconnect but also network-manager-openconnect-gnome . \nThe connection can then be configured via the settings UI: Under Network, VPN click the +, then choose Cisco AnyConnect Compatible VPN, then in the new connection dialog choose Juniper / Pulse OpenConnect and fill in the details. \n\nA: The current stable network manager doesn't support this feature just yet but it is in developement. It seems it will be possible in the 1.4 version.\nSource: http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openconnect-devel/2016-July/003752.html\n\nA: I don't use Network Manager but you may get the same result with the following command line.\necho \"PutHereYourPassWord\" | openconnect --juniper -u userName --passwd-on-stdin --no-cert-check --authgroup=Users -i tun1 --useragent 'NetScreen-Remote 9.0' --os linux https://10.10.10.10\n\nNote: Replace userName, Users and tun1 with your UserName and corresponding GroupName. Also make sure to select correct tunX device. If your GW does UA sniffing, you may need to set a valid UserAgentString.\nIf you don't want passwords in CLI, remove corresponding flags, like so:\nopenconnect --juniper -u userName --no-cert-check --authgroup=Users -i tun1 --useragent 'NetScreen-Remote 9.0' --os linux https://10.10.10.10\n\n\nA: See the \"Getting Help\" section of the OpenConnect web site at http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/mail.html\n", "Q: 14.04 software centre problems after trying to download dropbox After trying to download Dropbox I get an error message in top bar of screen:\n \"Unknown error ''(E:Malfomed line 56 in source list/etc/apt/sources.list(distparse))' This usually means that your installed packages have unmet dependencies.\"\nIt suggested running Package Manager or apt-get in the terminal but that produced nothing very helpful.

I'm rather new to Ubuntu and just trying to figure a few things out.\nJust as an example, I have a program that writes a lot of log files to a folder called /var/logging/data123.\nI'm running out of space, so i physically added a 2TB hard drive to my server, partitioned and formatted the drive.\nAm I able to mount this drive to the folder /var/loggingdata123 so as far as the program is concerned nothing has changed, but i have just gained 2TB of hard drive space.\nAm I correct in thinking this is possible or am I off the mark?\nThanks\n\nA: Sure, that's absolutely possible. If you want to automount it, proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute sudo blkid to get the UUID of the partition you want to mount. This will give some lines like this\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"0cde5cf9-b15d-4369-b3b1-4405204fd9ff\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nUsing the UUID instead of the device file name sda1 makes this entry more consistent in case you choose to install another drive in the same machine, which will have another UUID, but may receive the device file name the current drive now has\n(Windows analogy: If you plug in one USB stick, it may receive the drive letter F:, if you remove it and plug another, this other one will most likely get F: instead. If you now plug the first stick again, it will receive another letter, e.g. G:, so you can't rely on that).\nFind out which one is your new drive (sudo parted -l gives some more information on the partition). Best open a text editor and copy and paste it there, so you'll have it at hand.\n\n*Mount the hard drive somewhere, e.g. in /mnt/logs:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/logs\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/logs #Replace XY by the actual value\n\n\n*Move the existing log files to the new hard drive and check if there are any files remaning (files starting with a . will not be moved by this)\nsudo mv /var/logging/data123/* /mnt/logs\nls -Al /var/logging/data123 #Shouldn't print any files, else move them also\n\n\n*Unmount the drive\nsudo umount /mnt/logs\nsudo rmdir /mnt/logs\n\n\n*Open the file /etc/fstab with a rooted text editor, e.g. with sudo nano /etc/fstab and add the following line at the end:\nUUID=<uuid> /var/logging/data123 <format> defaults 0 2\n\nOf course, replace <uuid> with the partitions UUID and <format> with the partition format you chose, e.g. ext4. Save the file (When using nano, use Ctrl+O) and exit the editor (Ctrl+X)\n\n*Have the system automount the drive and check whether it worked:\nsudo mount -a\nmount #This will print a list of mounted drives, your new entry should be here\n\nFrom now on, the drive will be mounted in /var/logging/data123 on each boot automatically.\n", "Q: Permissions on secondary internal HDD So I recently reinstalled ubuntu on a computer at work and now I am setting up the secondary internal HDD. I followed the directions here for mounting the drive (the drives was already formatted into two partitions and had data on them so I only had to mount them). Everything went fine, except for permissions on the drives. I followed the instructions of changing the group of the drive to plugdev and the chmod lines below that. Myself and the only other user currently on the computer are both in the plugdev group. But I still have to use sudo to do a lot of things on the drive (was compiling q-chem earlier and had to sudo all of the commands that I normally wouldn't).\nI'd like to get this figured out, and to make sure that any time a new user is added to the computer that they will automatically be given permissions for the drive. I know I can probably just chown the drive, but I am not sure if multiple users can own the drive at the same time, and I don't want to have to do that every time a new user is created. Thanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: Why not just use thunar to access the permission for the mount, and set it to be read/write for everyone, as this seems to be what you are looking for?  Probably will need to sudo your way into thunar to give yourself privs to change the privs on the mounted location, so fair warning.\n", "Q: Lost data due to installing Ubuntu on the wrong partition I installed Ubuntu on the wrong partition, and lost a lot of important data.  What can I do to recover as much of the lost data as possible? I already booted into a live USB and I have read that it is good to use Foremost, but I don't really know how to use it. So I'd be really grateful for some guidance.\n\nA: To minimise the risk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not boot the system\n\n*Use a live system and mount the device as read only\nThere are certain data recovering programs (list on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_recovery_software). \nThis software will not recover all data (because it is overwritten) and file names might be wrong. But it's better than nothing.\nTo prevent this happening again it is always recommended to make images of your important volumes.\n", "Q: How to automatically \"live\" synchronize a single file in one direction How can I use a script to automatically and immediately update the backup of a single file?\n\nA: You can create an script (or even an alias) to copy the file before edit it using command cp and --backup=t like this\ncp --backup=t /path/to/file /path/to/backup.txt\n\nto get each time a backup of the file.\nIf you want everything inside one file named backup.txt you should use \ncat /path/to/file >> /path/to/backup.txt\n\nto attach the current file to backup.txt\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a harddrive that is already partitioned with Vista and win10 So I'm really new to Ubuntu and I would like to replace my vista OS with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.(Or 15.04 if that would be easier)\nMy hard drive has 2 partitions with 2 different operating systems currently (vista and win 10). I don't know if this makes the process different.\nMy Vista is completely bare, I've uninstalled everything and deleted every file that is not needed to run, I'm not worried about losing anything on this side of the partition. \nEssentially I want to delete vista and install Ubuntu as the new operating system (much like installing a new version of windows). I keep seeing the  procedure as: Install as a new partition, delete operating system, then delete partition that said operating system was on\". Is there any other way?\nAlso how advanced is this task? Can a beginner manage within the next week or will it take some reading?\n\nA: I suggest you read about some dual booting tutorials about Ubuntu. Well, I guess that when asking you about partitions, you should choose the 'something else' option and pick the vista partition there. Set it as root ( / ) and pick the ext4 file system.\n", "Q: How to see current interface/wifi speed I can see the download and upload speed for all interfaces using glances. In the network section we can see the Rx/s and Tx/s columns where I can see the value in Mbps.\nHowever I want to store this value in a variable. Is there any other command, which gives the current speed (bps, or Kbps, or Mbps) so that I can save that value in a variable in a bash script ?\nI want to do this for wlan0 interface.\n\nA: There is not a single command to do this. However, you could use this:  \neval $( \\\n    iwconfig wlan0 | \\\n    egrep -o 'Bit Rate=[0-9]+ [^ ]+' | \\\n    sed -e 's/ /_/;s/=/=\"/;s/$/\"/' \\\n    )\necho $Bit_Rate\n\nOn my system, currently, I get:  \n$ eval $(iwconfig wlan0 | egrep -o 'Bit Rate=[0-9]+ [^ ]+' | sed -e 's/ /_/;s/=/=\"/;s/$/\"/')\n$ echo $Bit_Rate\n54 Mb/s\n\niwconfig wlan0 outputs a bunch of information about wlan0 (try it and see).  \nThen egrep matches \"Bit Rate=\", followed by 1 or more digits, a blank, and 1 or more non-blanks. Because of the -o option, egrep outputs only the matched string.\nsed then changes the first blank to an underscore, the '=' to '=\"', and the end-of-line to '\"', producing a string like Bit_Rate=\"54 Mb/s\".\neval then interprets that string in your current shell. \nfor further education, read  \nfor i in iwconfig egrep sed bash ; do  \n    man $i\ndone\n\n", "Q: Degrading streaming video performance (Google Chrome and 15.10) I'm currently running Ubuntu 15.10 and the latest beta of Google Chrome 48.0.2564.48, and whenever I try and stream video through Chrome, performance drops off rapidly. I can start a video, but after a couple of minutes it stutters, and eventually stops. \nLooking at \"top\" in another window shows a rising load average (increasing through 4-5 when performance begins to drop) and when this reaches c. 10, the computer stops responding altogether. This seems to show a lot of chrome processes, even when running in incognito mode with no extensions active.\nI thought this might be an Adobe Flash issue, so I uninstalled that and am now running an opensource Flash player, but performance is still choppy (and even for Html5 video).\nWhat could be causing this? Is this a Ubuntu issue or a Chrome issue? \n\nA: It appears (after much fiddling about) that it was a unity/compiz issue.

On the other hand this box will establish an OpenVPN connection to the router of the first network, in which it will get IP address 192.168.2.162.\nSo I have one box with 2 IPs:\n- eth0: 192.168.93.11\n- tap0: 192.168.2.162\nIn both networks I have a router in which I can configure a static route so that any traffic for the other network is forwarded to the local IP of the ubuntu box.\nMy question is, how can I get the ubuntu box, presumably using iptables, to forward traffic for the other network, from eth0 to tap0 and vice versa?\n\nA: Try this on your box after all of your static routes are in place on your routers and your box is connected to the VPN (so that tap0 is available):\nroot@yourbox:~# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_foward=1\nroot@yourbox:~# iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.2.0/24 -d 192.168.93.0/24 -j ACCEPT\nroot@yourbox:~# iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.93.0/24 -d 192.168.2.0/24 -j ACCEPT\n\nWhat the above 3 commands will do is\n1) Enable IP forwarding in your kernel in order for it to route packets between the two networks\n2) Accept any traffic that is coming from the 192.168.2.0/24 network and destined for the 192.168.93.0/24 network\n3) Accept any traffic that is coming from the 192.168.93.0/24 network and destined for the 192.168.2.0/24 network\nHope this helps. :)\n", "Q: Unable to Scan wifi Network with Reaver I'm trying to crack the WPS code using Reaver!\nSo far I can only get to the step where it is supposed to scan the networks...\nWhat am I missing?\nhere is what I accomplished already: \nroot@xlr8nsys:~/Desktop# iwconfig\neth0      no wireless extensions.\nmon0      IEEE 802.11bgn  Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Tx-Power=14 dBm\n          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any\n          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=14 dBm\n          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Encryption key:off\n          Power Management:off\nlo        no wireless extensions.\nroot@xlr8nsys:~/Desktop# airmon-ng start wlan0\nFound 2 processes that could cause trouble.\nIf airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after\na short period of time, you may want to kill (some of) them!\nPID Name\n14493   avahi-daemon\n14494   avahi-daemon\nInterface   Chipset     Driver\nwlan0       Atheros     ath9k - [phy0]\n                (monitor mode enabled on mon0)\nroot@xlr8nsys:~/Desktop# ifconfig mon0 down\nroot@xlr8nsys:~/Desktop# macchanger -a mon0\nCurrent MAC:   08:ed:b9:38:47:ea (Hon Hai Precision Ind.

In instances where one is a .flac, I'd like to get rid of the dupes and keep the .flac. I'd like to only compare files that are in the same folder, as these represent albums, which is a useful way for me to organize my music.\nI'm running Ubuntu 15.10, with a bash shell.\nI would appreciate your help with command line tools.  Thanks so much,\n\nA: Before I answer your question, I have some assumptions:\nSay you have a directory like this \n$ ls -1 myMusics\nmusic1\nmusic1.flac\nmusic1.mp3\nmusic2.mp3\nmusic2b.mp3\nmusic3.flac\nmusic4.flac\nmusic4.wav\nmusic5b.flac\nmusic6\nmusic6.mp3\nmusic6.wav\n\nIn the directory above, only music1.flac and music4.flac duplicates will be removed, because music2.mp3, music2b.mp3, music3.flac and music5b.flac have no duplicates to be removed, and although music6 has duplicates, non of them have .flac extension. I've also assumed that there is no file such as music1.backup.flac in your directory. If such files exist, they will be treated as music1.flac duplicates ( if any ).  \nBased on the assumptions, you can do so:\n$ shopt -s extglob\n$ for i in `ls | egrep .flac$ | sed 's/\\.flac$//'`; do rm \"$i\".!(flac);done 2>/dev/null\n$ shopt -u extglob\n\nNow let's see what the above commands do:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Second one lists all the files that have .flac extension at the end (ls | egrep .flac$),\n\n*then removes the .flac from the end of the name (| sed 's/\\.flac$//),\n\n*then for each of the names that are result of two    previous steps, removes all of the files that has that name plus an extension,\n\n*except    for the ones which has .flac extension. rm \"$i\".!(flac) removes    every file that starts with \"$i\" and excludes the ones    that have    .flac extension. If you don't run shopt -s extglob (    that is, if    you don't enable extglob ), patterns like    \"$i\"!(.flac) will not    have any special meaning and bash searches    for the file name \"$i\"!(.flac) exactly. ( the name \"$i\" followed by ! and then a ( and so on. )\n\n*At the end, you can disable extglob using shopt -u extglob.  \n\n\nYou can see the following about extglob in man bash:\n\nIf  the  extglob  shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin, several extended\n  pattern matching operators are recognized.  In the following  description,  a  pattern-list  is  a list of one or more patterns separated by a |.  Composite patterns\n  may be formed using one or more of the following sub-patterns:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*?(pattern-list)\n  Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns  \n  \n**(pattern-list)\n  Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns  \n  \n*+(pattern-list)\n  Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns  \n  \n*@(pattern-list)\n  Matches one of the given patterns  \n  \n*!(pattern-list)\n  Matches anything except one of the given patterns\n\nAlso, take a look at this SO question:\nHow can I use inverse or negative wildcards when pattern matching in a unix/linux shell?\n", "Q: How do i change my locale safely? 1) How do I check which locales are supported on my system?\n2) How do I change my locale safely? \n3) What are some of the side-effects of doing this?\nReason I'm asking these questions is because I want to use a different collating sequence rather from the proper dictionary order so I can use regular expressions globally, but I'm not sure how this will affect pathname expansions.\n\nA: To check which locales have been generated and are currently available to use, run:\nlocale -a\n\nTo check 'the current locale', i.e. which locales have been set for the various locale categories, run:\nlocale\n\nThere is a designated collate locale category: LC_COLLATE.

The install went without issue and plugging the USB stick to the running system I am able to see the file system structure.\nHowever, whenever I restart a machine with this USB stick plugged in, the system installed there never boots, the boot process always falls back to whatever is internally installed in the machine. I have tried this USB stick in different computers (making sure in all of then the USB is first in the boot order), I have re-installed Ubuntu to it, but I never manage to boot from it.\nMy best guess is that something might be wrong with the installation, but I have no idea what. Any ideas on what may be amiss?\n\nA: As it has been determined in the comments, sudo dd if=/dev/sdb iflag=fullblock bs=512 count=1 2>/dev/null | strings showed no trace of GRUB on the device.\nSo the problem is that the device lacks a bootloader, which explains why trying to boot it didn't avail: the BIOS of the machines in question simply fell back to a bootloader present on another device to boot an OS, which had the effect of booting another OS.\nThe fix is either installing GRUB on the device or reinstalling Ubuntu on the device making sure that GRUB gets installed to the right device:\n\nOn a side note, installing GRUB to another device had the effect of either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding an entry for the USB device if the target device had GRUB installed in it already;\n\n*Installing GRUB if the target device didn't have GRUB installed in it already.\n\n\nSo you might want to fix that as well.\nThe first problem is easily solvable by removing the relevant entry from GRUB;\nFor the second problem, have a look at one of these two answers, depending on whether you installed Ubuntu in legacy mode or in UEFI mode:\nLegacy: https://askubuntu.com/a/168517/380067\nUEFI: https://askubuntu.com/a/304892/380067\n\nA: There might be many possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your USB stick has a problem: try installing on a new USB stick.\n\n*The installation source is not \"healthy\": check it by installing on the machine or download it again and re-install.\n\n*You forgot to choose the right boot device from the boot option: press \"ESC\" or \"F1\"...etc to get into the boot menu or modify it from the BIOS.\n\n*(less probable) you chose the wrong partition: re-install and choose it carefully.\n\n\nAbove is what I can provide for it.

Is it safe to delete the PPA after successful installation of the package?\nFor example: Yesterday, I put a PPA in the list cause of the Trackpad function. Now, it works, but will it work when I delete it?\nIn my understanding PPAs are just the sources for the packages and after installation there is no need for them, is this right?\n\nA: If you delete the PPA then you'll still able to use the application normally since the PPA is just a software resource nothing more.Read More\nBut, you may use the PPA for next release, updates ,security , bug fix, patches, etc...\nSo, it's better not to delete the PPA if you want to be up to date with these software\n\nA: Adding a PPA to our sources give us the advantage to install newer application versions that did not yet find their way into the official repositories.\nHowever by doing so we may also introduce instabilities from not yet fully tested releases.\nIn case we keep the PPA active this will also automatically install any software upgrade that was provides from this PPA. By this new bugs may be introduced. It is therefore good practice to inactivate a PPA after we had successfully installed a package we are happy with.\nThis can be done by just unticking a PPA from Software & Updates. By this we can easily activate it again in case we want to upgrade later:\n\nOnly if we are sure that we always want a fresh new release of any package, and the PPA will not provide updates for other packages we may keep it active.\nFew PPAs will also provide security updates. In this case we also may want to keep the PPA active. However in general having packages from a PPA is not without risk.\n\nA: \nIs it safe to delete the PPA after successful installation of the package?\n\nDepending on what you consider \"safe\". Yes, you can delete any software repository from your sources.list you wouldn't notice. But, you also will be unable to upgrade the packages from that repository, which may offer bugfixes or security patches.\nIt is recommended that unless you have a very good reason, you keep the repositories on your sources.list (apt 1.1.10+ changes the strategy to update package lists, which improves performance) and allow upgrades. If you want to keep a package on a specific version, you may instead prevent upgrades of that specific package until you are ready to upgrade it, without affecting other packages that the repository provides.\nNote that it is normally unnecessary to remove a line of the sources.list since you can comment it out (# at the start of the line), which prevents you from forgetting from what repository you installed a specific package.\nPPA's maintainers are known for not following the packaging guide thoughtfully which may cause problems. If you are able to get the package through Ubuntu's own repositories, you are less risky of running into problems.\n", "Q: I can't reinstall mscorefonts I need to use Times New Roman Font.

I have installed VS Code using Ubuntu Make, how do I update it to the latest version?\n\nA: This has been extensively discussed on this upstream issue (and its duplicate) a while ago.\nBasically, the philosophy is that the upstream tool has a better idea on how to update itself than us, so we let it (and that's why we don't install it in a zone requesting root access.\nFor instance, all JetBrains' based IDEs like IntelliJ, PyCharm and Android Studio have their own update optimization, downloading only the requested delta (can be few megabytes instead of the whole IDE) and dealing with configuration migration.\nSo, the vast majority of frameworks and IDEs supported by Ubuntu Make should just be updatable via the auto-update mechanism in the tool itself. For others not supporting those, the easiest way is to reinstall it (with the same command you use to install it first). Ubuntu Make will catch the current installation path (even if you modified it), will warn you that it's not empty and will download latest available version (with optionally new requirements). If all that is fine, it will replace the older version with the new one.\nJust a note, be use to grab the Ubuntu Make ppa if you are not running the development serie in case the upstream web pages parsing changed.\n", "Q: dpkg and systemd: unit file silently disappears I try to package my self-made daemon into debian package.

The system is simple, an augmenting number followed by a letter, the rest of the file name contains only letters and underscores. Notes for a certain topic are called: 16115P-foobar.md whilst the code files for that topic are: 16115P-foobar.c 16115P-barfoo.h etc. \nAs the program progresses with each lesson, I am copying all program files before modifying them; So as to have files of each step of the course. As it is required of me to modify the program using the lessons topic; the first thing I do is copy and rename the files.

Then we read in the new number from user interactively, and stick that new number for each cropped filename.\n$ ls\n16115P-barfoo.h  16115P-foobar.c  16115P-foobar.md  updateNames.sh*\n$ ./updateNames.sh 16115*                                                                                                        \nEnter new number for all specified files: \n17121\n17121P-barfoo.h\n17121P-foobar.c\n17121P-foobar.md\n$ cat updateNames.sh                                                                                                             \n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ $# -eq 0  ]; \nthen\n    echo \"<<< Error: no arguments provided\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"Enter new number for all specified files: \" \nread NEWNUMBER\nfor file in \"$@\";\ndo\n  BASE=\"$(echo \"$file\" | awk -F '-' '{ gsub( /[[:digit:]]/,\"\"); print }')\"\n  echo $NEWNUMBER\"\"$BASE\n  # uncomment this line for actual copying\n  # cp \"$file\" $NEWNUMBER\"\"$BASE\ndone\n\n$ \n\n", "Q: Realtek RTL8723be doesn't have good reception Only when I'm closer to the router, it shows any signal, but when I'm just little far from it, it is not showing wifi routers signals.\n\nA: With Ubuntu 16.04 and later, go to Parameter settings as nothing needs to be downloaded\nProgress from Larry Finger from here\nIf you installed rtlwifi-new-dkms from Pilot6's PPA, it will need to be removed with sudo apt-get remove rtlwifi-new-dkms\nReboot, then\n\n\nsudo apt-get install git build-essential\ngit clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new\ncd rtlwifi_new\nmake\nsudo make install\nReboot and then\nParameter Setting\nsudo modprobe -rv rtl8723be\nsudo modprobe -v rtl8723be ant_sel=1\nTest wireless, if no change then\nsudo modprobe -rv rtl8723be\nsudo modprobe -v rtl8723be ant_sel=2\nTest wireless again, one or the other should result in better reception\nWhen you find that one works better than the other\necho \"options rtl8723be ant_sel=X\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtlbtcoex.conf\nWhere X is 1 or 2- whatever resulted in better performance, in the case of Swapnil Sharma it would be\necho \"options rtl8723be ant_sel=1\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtlbtcoex.conf\nThen the parameter will be remembered following a restart\n", "Q: How do I install Vivaldi beta 2 on Ubuntu 15.10?

I have a HUGE SSD, so I want to expand /boot, NOT delete files there.

Details differ depending on your partition layout. If most of your disk space is in an LVM setup, shrinking it requires jumping through some extra hoops. There are numerous existing questions that answer these questions, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to resize partitions?\n\n*Why I'm seeing a lock besides the partition I'm trying to modify with gparted?\n\n*How can I resize an LVM partition?

I am using Ubuntu 14.04. with Unity DE.\nHow can I make keyboard shortcuts work on key release, not on key press? \nFor example, if I want to use the windows key for multiple shortcuts, it works only for the one that's triggered by the win key alone, because the shortcut works before the next key press is registered.\n\nA: Not exactly an answer, but maybe a solution.\nAFAIK, the keys you mention are modifier keys which are intended to modify the effect of another (non-modifier) key being pressed simultaneously.\nI'm not very well versed in hardware, but I believe some of the modifier processing may actually occur in the keyboard hardware or in the drivers - so they're not easily accessible at the application level. I know that some keyboards I had many years ago put out 8-bit ASCII characters and actually modified some of those bits when you pressed Ctrl or shift.\nThat being said, running xev shows that \"higher level\" software can get access to the actual scan codes coming out of the keyboard \"device\", so I expect that it is possible to write your own replacement keyboard driver which will do anything you are skilled enough to code, but doing that might involve a lot of knowledge of the kernel and other internals of Linux.\nInstead of growing hair on your eyeballs learning all of that stuff, first consider a few alternatives that may serve some or all of your needs:\nThe xmodmap command allows you to alter your keyboard layout by changing what individual keys do. This takes place before any applications see the keystrokes, so it should work transparently.\nAutoKey is a keyboard macro processor which allows you to define text phrases and hotkeys which trigger phrase substitutions or run entire macros written in Python.\nIt is designed for use in gui environments which are supported by either GTK or QT, but also will work fine in a terminal window.\nEach macro or phrase can also have an associated window filter so that it will only work in windows which pass the filter (and not do inappropriate things if invoked in a window which it was not designed to work in.)\nOnce a macro is invoked, you're essentially running a Python program which can do almost anything Python is capable of - limited primarily by your programming skills - because there are Python modules for almost anything you might want to accomplish.\nSince AutoKey is designed to emit keystrokes that look exactly as if you typed them, it should work with almost any program. The program will just think you typed whatever keystrokes AutoKey emits and won't even know that you didn't type them. (There are some fine points to this, but it mostly just works.)\n", "Q: Uninstalling programs in Ubuntu In Ubuntu, is there something like the control panel of Windows from where I can uninstall a program?\n\nA: open software center, there you find the installed software option, click any software you want to uninstall and remove it.\n\n\nA: Open a console and type the following:\nsudo apt-get remove $PackageName\n\nPlease note that doing so will NOT remove dependency to prevent breaking your system.\nBest regards,\nGael.\n", "Q: How to install ionic-lab on Ubuntu 14.04 and run app?

In both instances, if there were other users in the www-data group, they would also have rw permissions on that file.\nThe only difference that comes to mind between user and group permissions, would be files within any directories that have the 'sticky bit' set on them.

It shall contain all these \nsnd-powermac \nsnd-aoa \nsnd-aoa-fabric-layout\nsnd-aoa-soundbus\nsnd-aoa-i2sbus\nsnd-aoa-codec-tas\n\nIf it doesn't then that might be the reason why your sound doesn't work. You can modprobe these into the live session. Type:\n$ sudo modprobe snd-powermac\n$ sudo modprobe snd-aoa \n$ sudo modprobe snd-aoa-fabric-layout\n$ sudo modprobe snd-aoa-soundbus\n$ sudo modprobe snd-aoa-i2sbus\n$ sudo modprobe snd-aoa-codec-tas\n\nNow check and see if the sound works. If it does then we have to put these into /etc/modules so they load at startup. Open /etc/modules in your favorite text editor and add:\nsnd-powermac\nsnd-aoa \nsnd-aoa-fabric-layout\nsnd-aoa-soundbus\nsnd-aoa-i2sbus\nsnd-aoa-codec-tas\n\nRestart the computer to insure that modules are indeed loaded on boot. In case it doesn't then you might have blacklisted them somewhere. You can find the file containing the text \"i2sbus\" with sudo grep -rnw '/etc' -e \"i2sbus\".\n", "Q: How many times can I use a bootable USB flash drive to install Ubuntu? If I have 100 computers, and I want to install Ubuntu Linux, can I put the flash drive into the first computer, install Ubuntu Linux, pop it out, put it in the next computer, install Ubuntu Linux and so on or do I have to wipe and recreate the bootable flash drive?\n\nA: The point is that Ubuntu, like all forms of Linux, is free*, and so there are no restrictions on the number of times you may install it using whatever medium you like. Therefore, until your flash drive falls apart, from extended use, max # of read/write cycles exceeded, etc., you may keep installing Ubuntu and reinstalling it to your heart's content.\n*Insert appropriate interpretation of \"free\" here, or whatever.\n\nA: You can use the flash drive to install as many computers as you want. You don't need to wipe and recreate it.\n\nA: You can use it as many times as you wish, there is no limit on how many times you can use the bootable USB to flash Ubuntu.\n\nA: As has been pointed out by several answers, the flash drive won't wear out or run out of reads (for this application).  However, one comment suggested that each install could take an hour or more.  You may wish to consider buying a dozen flash drives and install systems in parallel.  Rather get it done in a day than a week, unless you need the job security.\n", "Q: Getting wrong resolution on old samsung monitor Today i connected my pc with old samsung sync master 591s monitor and getting strange display resolution.

I have Windows 7 and Ubuntu dual-booted on my hard drive. My Ubuntu installation became kind of messed up and I don't know how to fix it. So it would just be easier for me to just do a fresh install of Ubuntu over the existing partition. Is there a way for me to do this without reformatting the whole drive and having to reinstall Windows?\n\nA: Sure. Just choose \"something else\" during installation for manual partitioning and reformat the partitions that Ubuntu is supposed to use. Obviously, all their data will be lost in the process, but no need to touch Windows partitions.\nRelevant comment by TrailRider:\n\nThe answer is correct but may have be more complicated that needed. You should be able to boot from the cd/usb and after clicking the install button, the choices window should give you the option to \"Erase Ubuntu and reinstall\" . Selecting that would format the Ubuntu partition only and do a clean install of Ubuntu.\n\n", "Q: Looking for some simple webcam software It seems that uvccapture might meet my need for a simple webcam application.

I have a printer hosted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS that I've been tasked with locking down. The printer needs to be accessible to both legitimate Windows (7/10) and Ubuntu 14.04 users, but not generally accessible.\nAt this point, I can get the printer to broadcast via both CUPS and Samba, and I can print from the printer from any Windows computer, but I can't get the server to challenge the print attempt with a request for authentication. The Samba config challenges for a username/password when attempting to access a shared folder on the Ubuntu server from a Windows machine, but not when adding a printer.\nPlease let me know if I can provide any additional information, or if what I'm trying to do is impossible.\nThank you\n\nA: I had a similar problem recently and the linked post in the singular comment above didn't actually answer the question posed here (setting up Windows with Samba authenticated printer shares, NOT the other way around).  I wanted to only allow authenticated access to printers shared from Linux.  In addition, I'm running Ubuntu Server LTS, which means command-line only access (via SSH in my case) so most tutorials/guides I'm finding show the Ubuntu GUI and are therefore useless to me.\nThe [printers] section with the option printable = yes defines the mapping to CUPS.  Setting browseable = no prevents this option from being displayed in printer lists.  It's the actual printer spool for print jobs, so that makes sense.  However, by default, anyone with a correctly configured printer setup pointed at and can access the Samba server has implicit access to print without privileges (i.e. anonymous access).  To force authenticated access to the print spooler, I used the valid users = bob, joe, mary option.\nWindows looks for the print$ share name for printers.  The associated section [print$] declares browseable = yes, which grants anyone who connects to the Samba server the ability to see the available printers.  Even though guest ok = no is the default, Samba still allows what I consider to be anonymous access to any printer.  To force authentication, I used the valid users = bob, joe, mary option.  If you want to hide printers from being seen in the first place from unauthenticated users, you can try using browseable = no and then use the include = /etc/samba/print.%U.conf option to change browseable = yes for specific users as per this Unix StackExchange post:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/245785/show-specific-samba-shares-only-to-some-users\nBringing it all together, /etc/samba/smb.conf now looks like:\n[printers]\n   comment = All Printers\n   browseable = no\n   path = /var/spool/samba\n   printable = yes\n   guest ok = no\n   read only = yes\n   create mask = 0700\n   valid users = bob, joe, mary\n\n[print$]\n   comment = Printer Drivers\n   path = /var/lib/samba/printers\n   browseable = yes\n   read only = yes\n   guest ok = no\n   valid users = bob, joe, mary\n\nOne side effect of requiring authentication that I ran into on Windows was that attempting to double-click on a printer to Open it (the default verb on Windows) as an unrecognized user caused an \"Access Denied\" message box to appear but was never prompted for credentials.  Windows was probably passing along that user's logged in Windows credentials in that instance.  Fortunately, right-clicking and selecting the \"Connect...\" option prompted for credentials.  After connecting successfully, I was able to Open the printer, which asked me to manually set up my printer drivers since I don't attempt to deliver those via Samba and is beyond the scope of the answer to this question.  Then I successfully printed a test page and all was well.\n", "Q: I need a chroot user to now have ssh public key access I have previously setup a chroot to lock sftp users to their home directory only.\nSo I have this in sshd_config\nMatch User theuser\n    ChrootDirectory /home/theuser\n    AllowTCPForwarding no\n    X11Forwarding no\n    ForceCommand internal-sftp\n\nand I'm assuming I need to remove the ForceCommand internal-sftp to allow ssh connection, but this gives me a 'Broken Pipe' message if I try to ssh from theuser.\nI then need to allow public key access for that user, and hope to allow them to ssh-copy-id theuser@1234IP.. \nI am also assuming my answer is something to do with setting - authorizedkeysfile\nbut this seems quite disruptive at best. \nAny help is most appreciated - \nThanks.\n\nA: There is more than that.

In case you're wondering, I'd like to have access to everything in /home as well as everything in /usr like icons, themes, and so forth. \n\n*Would the partition scheme above work?\n\n*I know that some of these are going to have to be Logical partitions, however I have no experience using them.  How would you go about setting that up if you were me? \n\n*Assuming everything above seems legit, I seem to remember reading somewhere that whenever /usr is on a separate partition, you have to go through some extra steps in order for the OSes to boot up properly.  If that's the case, what should I do to get this working properly? \n\n*Let's also assume that I'm fairly new to linux but am learning so much about it very quickly.  What are my chances of getting this right the first time?  How about my chances of messing everything up altogether and having to re-install a single distro until I have more experience?\n\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.  I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about this idea of mine.  I'm very excited to hear what you have to share with me about this little project!\n\nA: I don't think that /usr would be a good idea because of then things might clash and replace each other with their Distro's files but for /home, even though it would be less damage than /usr on the same 2 distros, I still wouldn't recommend it unless you also want a corrupt system (Especially if you do things such as Hibernate, etc).\n\nA: Sharing /usr between distributions is so close to impossible as to make no difference. That's where program files reside, and one of the key differences between distributions is their different program files. Thus, the only way that sharing /usr would make any sense is if the two distributions were just different installations of one distribution, or possibly minor variants (like Ubuntu and Lubuntu). Even then, you'd have problems with conflicts because of different packages being installed, different package versions (even when they differ only during package upgrades), etc. Overall, it might be theoretically possible to share a /usr partition in some limited cases, but actually managing it would be impractical in the extreme; and in most cases (Ubuntu and Fedora, say), sharing /usr just plain won't work.\nSharing /home is more practical, but still presents some challenges. Basically, user configuration files (~/.config-for-some-program) often include distribution-specific references -- for instance, pointers to icons that might differ from one distribution to another. Differences can even exist between different versions of one distribution (Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10, for instance). Thus, although sharing the /home partition is practical, it's important that you take steps to ensure that users on the different distributions have different home directories. In the case of Ubuntu, and many other distributions, this is most easily done by giving the users different usernames -- for instance, use a username of ubuntu for Ubuntu and fedora for Fedora; or trusty and wily for Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10, respectively. After installation, you can change the username without altering the home directory location by using a tool like usermod, although this is best done from another account. (Personally, I usually activate direct root logins for things like this, although that's something that's discouraged by Ubuntu's security policy. That issue is a long debate in and of itself.)\nOne more point: You refer to the \"Bios Boot partition,\" but I think you mean a separate /boot partition. Such a partition should not be shared between distributions. In most cases, a separate /boot partition is not required; but if you do use one, you'll need a separate /boot partition for each distribution. The issue is similar to the one of /usr, but less extreme -- kernels and GRUB configurations reside in /boot, so there's a possibility of file conflict, particularly for closely-related distributions.\nOTOH, the name BIOS Boot partition refers to a small (typically ~1 MiB) partition in which GRUB stores part of itself. This partition has no filesystem; GRUB just dumps its code there \"raw.\" It's used only by GRUB, only on GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks, and only when booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode (rather than in EFI/UEFI mode). On a new installation on new hardware, I recommend using EFI mode rather than BIOS mode, which obviates the need for a BIOS Boot Partition, but creates a need for an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a ~100-1,000 MiB (I recommend >= 550 MiB) FAT32 partition that holds the EFI boot loader(s). One ESP can be shared between distributions. I realize I've just tossed out a whole bunch of terminology and concepts with which you may not be familiar. If so, good; you'll be better off learning about these things now rather than later, after you've botched your installation because you've made mistakes because you didn't understand what you were doing. Here are some references to help you avoid making such mistakes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*A question and answers on the differences between BIOS and EFI booting on Superuser.com -- This provides the basics of the preceding, but is more concise.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than the preceding one.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\nThis is all simpler when single-booting because you don't need to coordinate boot modes between multiple distributions -- you can install one distribution in either BIOS mode or EFI mode and it doesn't really matter which mode you use. If the boot modes differ between two distributions, though, that's where the troubles begin.\n", "Q: Can't boot from USB after bundled install On a carbon X1, I attempted to install 15.10 via usb boot disk.

This comment led me to mkusb \nI used mkusb with a newly downloaded lubuntu iso. \n\n\nStatus: It's working. \n\nA: Try RUFUS for Windows, this USB Installer is one of a kind in that it can also UEFI Bootloader Tag a USB Drive that it's writing the ISO to meaning that the drive is bootable from UEFI.\nPS: Download Rufus at: https://rufus.akeo.ie/\nPS: It needs Windows to run; from my experience, IT WILL NOT WORK ON WINE OF VIRTUAL MACHINES.\nPS: Darn, it really is broken, by the looks of it, you have no init!!\n", "Q: How to export a profile in Toxic? I recently installed the Tox client Toxic and created an encrypted profile with it, however I now want to export my profile in order to import it into another Tox client, but after going through the /help section, I am not sure how to do this. It said for more information not covered in its built-in help section to go to its manpage, however after typing:\nman toxic\n\nThis is the output:\nNo manual entry for toxic\nSee 'man 7 undocumented' for help when manual pages are not available.\n\nSo as I can't seem to find the manpage, nor any documentation documenting how to export a Toxic profile I am lost... So how do I export it? It says here that there is a way.\nI am running the latest version of Toxic and Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: According to tox wiki page, the profiles are stored in ~/.config/tox/ , specifically the file is profile_toxic.tox.  Exporting simply is a matter of copying that file and saving it. To import profile on another machine, simply copy over that file into the ~/.config/tox directory, or use toxic -f /path/to/saved/profile_toxic.tox\n", "Q: module ndiswrapper not found So,  just installed 14.04 on dual boot with Windows 10.\nPleasantly surprised that installation went without a hitch but when I first booted there were no drivers for my USB wifi adaptor  (NetGear WNDA3100).\nNo problem I thought.. I'm sure I played this game in the dim and distant past.\nFound the driver I need (bcmn43xx64.inf). now just need to install ndiswrapper.\nIt shows up in the program manager as available from a \"universal source\",  but having no internet that's not much help.\nReading a few forums it seems that it might be on the installation DVD.  It isn't.\nI manage to find files online including:\nndisgtk_0.85-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb\nndiswrapper-1.59.tar.gz\nndiswrapper-common_1.59-2_all.deb\nndiswrapper-dkms_1.59-2_all.deb\nndiswrapper-utils-1.9_1.59-2_amd64.deb\n\nmost seemed to install in the program manager except one which insisted on me inserting my DVD ?!?!  I did this anyway and it still refused to install.\nThere was no obvious way to try running it other than through the terminal so I tried ndiswrapper -V.   A load of info about bits being missing and out of date.\nI'm pretty much at the point of giving up.  Surely it can't be this hard?\nAny help would be most gratefully received.\nEdit to add:\nsudo dpkg -s ndiswrapper-common      Install OK\nsudo dpkg -s ndiswrapper-utils-1.9   Install OK\n\nOther information:\nlsusb - 0846:9011 Netgear, inc.  WDNA 3100V2 [Broadcom BCM4323]\n\nAm trying to use \"bcmn43xx64\" \nndiswrapper -l shows it listed as installed but not working / error state.\nEdit No.2\nManaged to uninstall the invalid driver and have reinstalled with the same file from a different source.  \nRunning ndsiwrapper -l  it now shows the driver as functional and the hardware as present.\nMy only remaining question is how do I get Ubuntu to recognize it?  I have tried rebooting and it isn't appearing.  Is there a set up wizard I can run or will I need to do some kind of manual set up?\nAny help appreciated :)\nEdit 3.\nStill no luck getting this to work.  Nothing is \"appearing\" to let me use the hardware.\nThe only other clues are from ndiswrapper -V  which says the following:\nmodinfo: ERROR: module ndiswrapper not found. Module version is too old.\nUtils Version: 1.9, Utils version needed by module '0'\nModule Details: Modinfo ERROR: Module ndiswrapper not found.\n\nNone of that looks particularly healthy and I assume is somehow linked to the problem..  though I have no idea what any of it means.\n\nA: It doesn't look like NDIS wrapper kernel module was installed successfuly. Make sure you installed the DKMS package for NDIS wrapper, that you can find here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/ndiswrapper-dkms (also, meet packages.ubuntu.com where you can download all the packages that Ubuntu provides directly without 3rd parties or trawling through FTP sites).\nAfter you install the DKMS module, it should report something like this:\nSetting up ndiswrapper-dkms (1.59-2) ...\nLoading new ndiswrapper-1.59 DKMS files...\nFirst Installation: checking all kernels...\nBuilding only for 3.19.0-26-generic\nBuilding initial module for 3.19.0-26-generic\nDone.\n\nndiswrapper:\nRunning module version sanity check.\n - Original module\n   - No original module exists within this kernel\n - Installation\n   - Installing to /lib/modules/3.19.0-26-generic/updates/dkms/\n\ndepmod.......\n\nDKMS: install completed.\n\nThen sudo modprobe ndiswrapper should succeed.\nAfter that, ndiswrapper -v should say something like:\nutils version: '1.9', utils version needed by module: '1.9'\nmodule details:\nfilename:       /lib/modules/3.19.0-26-generic/updates/dkms/ndiswrapper.ko\nversion:        1.59\nvermagic:       3.19.0-26-generic SMP mod_unload modversions \n\n(your version numbers will probably be different, I'm running 15.04 vivid)\nThen you should try to reinstall the driver using ndiswrapper -i.\nFinally, all this may not be needed - Linux has a driver specifically for Broadcom USB wireless adapters called rndis_wlan. As detailed here. If when you plug the device, the rndis_wlan driver is not loaded automatically (you can check by running lsmod | grep rndis), then try to load it manually using modprobe rndis_wlan and it may detect and enable your device. If not, run dmesg | tail to check for kernel errors and report them here.\nAnother thing to note, is that if you can't get your wireless to work, then its often easy to just plug the computer to a wired network and do all your troubleshooting with full network access - which will allow you to apt-get packages.\n", "Q: Samba authentication fails I have been endlessly searching for what went wrong, and can't figure it out.

First,\nGrab Your Gear\nYou'll need a blank USB drive with at least 2 GB of free space on it.\nNow download your prefered version of Ubuntu (currently 14.04.3 LTS or 15.10) http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nAnd finally grab the Universal USB Installer program: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nCreating a Startup Disk\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your USB drive\n\n*Open the Universal USB Installer\n\n*Select 'Ubuntu' as the distribution, select your .iso file, select your USB drive, and click Create.\n\n\nBooting from USB\nHere's where it gets a little tricky. Every computer is different, so I can't give exact instructions. When turning your computer on, look for the boot selection screen. Not all computers have one. \nIf you don't have one, enter BIOS (usually F2 or F8), enable USB boot if needed, and re-arrange your boot options so that USB drive is at the top. Now reboot your computer with the USB drive plugged in, and you should boot into the installer.\nInstalling Ubuntu\nThe installer may take some time to load, but once it does, it will give you step-by-step instructions on how to install Ubuntu. Since you don't have anything else on the laptop, you can select the option to erase everything and install Ubuntu.\nAnd that's it! The rest of the instructions are in the installer, and everything else should work like a charm! Unless, of course, it doesn't, in which case we'll be here to help with any problems.\n", "Q: Package dependency problems with broken packages but none listed to fix I am trying to install wine on Ubuntu 15.04, I had it working before but I think something went wrong with 32 or 64 bit installations so I tried removing it to start again.\nNow I am trying to install it again but running apt-get install wine\nroot@pc-ubuntu:/home/dav# apt-get install wine\nReading package lists...

The new monitor does not have a driver for linux but I assumed a driver is not needed. \nNot even sure how to debug this.

To install Ubuntu, I chose the option install alongside Windows 10 or something similar to this. Then I created a new partition for Ubuntu and installed it. After installation, the boot menu did not show up. Initially I thought Ubuntu has not been installed, but when I plugged in the USB drive and wanted to install Ubuntu I saw an option of reinstalling Ubuntu on my machine. So, I found out that Ubuntu is installed. Pressing F8 and F12 also does not help.\nCan anyone help me bring up the GRUB boot menu?\nIn Windows, I also entered the command bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi in cmd, but still the boot menu does not show up.\n\nReply (Himanshu) :\nJust boot in bios and, if you can, add boot option with name say ubuntu and path EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi. No need for live PCB or anything. Move the boot option to top. This is for dell GUI bios but I assume it works for all. Or you may want to see this or this, where you can enable Windows Boot Loader for one boot or forever as you wish, and boot Ubuntu from it. If you want now, you can use the installed Ubuntu terminal to use the commands update-grub to use GRUB instead. (Not enough reputation to answer properly btw.)\n\nA: I have read many answers and tried accordingly but the problem was still there, so I decided to do it myself as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Click the Start menu and select Settings.\n\n\n*Select UPDATE & SECURITY.\n\n\n*Click Recovery.\n\n\n*Under Advanced startup, click the Restart now button. The system will restart and show the Windows 10 boot menu.\n\n\n\n*Select Troubleshoot.\n\n\n*Choose Advanced options.\n\n\n\n*Select UEFI Firmware Settings.\n\n\n*Click Restart to restart the system and enter UEFI (BIOS) setup utility.\n\n\n*F10 BIOS setup -> System Configuration tab ->\nBoot Options -> OS Boot Manager ->\nUbuntu -> (select the Ubuntu option and move this option up to the top of the list) ->\nF10 Save and Exit (press F10 to save Ubuntu as the default boot option) ->\nF10 (press F10 again to save the changes to the BIOS/UEFI setup utility)\n\nWhen the computer restarts, the Ubuntu boot menu will be shown.\n\nA: Live boot Ubuntu and select try Ubuntu option from the GRUB menu that appears and then install boot repair by typing in following commands. \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\nA: I'm presuming GRUB successfully installed, but something is clearly amiss. I know you said you already tried bcdedit, but here's the command to set it: bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi. If you set this and could not boot, as you have indicated already, don't forget to rescind the change you made using bcdedit /deletevalue {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi.\nTry following the steps detailed in Enkouyami's answer (i.e. chrooting into your installed Ubuntu system from the live CD and then reinstalling grub manually).\nIf the above fail, you could try installing grub2win. This allows you to boot grub2 from your Windows EFI firmware by making edits to the boot code. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully on the project's page if taking choosing method.\nAnother method instead of grub2win is Super Grub2 Disk, which is a live CD that allows you to boot into a variety of operating systems. I would try this first instead of grub2win, as there is less risk involved if something goes awry. I have not used Super Grub2 Disk personally, but I hear it is an incredibly useful tool. Using this tool, you can restore grub by following the instructions here.\n\nA: There is a setting in /etc/default/grub called GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden which prevents the GRUB menu from showing during the timeout period unless you press the Esc key. Check to see if this setting is enabled by GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden, and if it is enabled open the /etc/default/grub file for editing in nano text editor and disable it.\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nComment out the line that says GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden by preceding it with a # character. Make sure that the GRUB_TIMEOUT value there is set to a value larger than zero, for example GRUB_TIMEOUT=10. Save the file. \nThen run the update-grub command and reboot:\nsudo update-grub  \nsudo reboot\n\nNano text editor keyboard shortcuts\nUse the keyboard combination Ctrl + O and after that press Enter to save the file to its current location.\nUse the keyboard combination Ctrl + X to exit nano. \nOther useful links\n\n\n*\n\n*How to repair GRUB2 when Ubuntu won't boot  \n\n*Using EasyBCD to boot to GRUB from Windows boot menu   \n\n*Installing GRUB2 Ubuntu documentation wiki\n\nA: *\n\n*On Windows 10, go to the start menu.\n\n*Search and open Recovery Options.

On the live session, open a terminal and enter the following commands in:\n\nsudo mount /dev/sda# /mnt\n\nReplace the hashtag in /dev/sda# with the number representing the  partition where you had Ubuntu installed. You can check using gnome-disks or gparted.\nsudo mount /dev/sda# /mnt/boot/efi\n\nReplace the hashtag in /dev/sda# with the number representing the EFI partition.

Look for boot option priorities and move Ubuntu above the Windows Boot Manager. Go to the option to save the changes then reboot.\n\n*Lastly you can try using Boot-Repair.\n\nA: There's no need for live PCB or anything.\n\nJust boot in BIOS (press F2 in Dell Inspiron) and, Add boot option with name say ubuntu and path EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi.\nMove the boot option to top.

It returns a \"PrimaryConnection\" that is activated.\nYou can then query the activated connection and see if it matches the connection you are interested in.\nFor example:\n\nqdbus --system --literal org.freedesktop.NetworkManager\n/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/Whatever\norg.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.GetAll\norg.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Connection.Active\nqdbus --system --literal  org.freedesktop.NetworkManager\n/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/AccessPoint/Whatever org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get\norg.freedesktop.NetworkManager.AccessPoint.Ssid\n\n(probably just simpler to run iwgetid -r after you detect the property change)\n\nA: While it's certainly possible to use dbus , personally I'd go with simple bash while loop + awk\nwhile [ \"$(iwconfig 2> /dev/null |  awk '/Access Point/ && /XX:YY:ZZ:11:22:33/ {print \"true\" }')\" != \"true\" ]; do : ; sleep 0.25 ;done ; echo DONE\n\nWhat is happening there ? While loop keeps running, testing output of iwconfig filtered out with awk. So far as the awk doesn't find  the mac address of the access that you want to connect to, loop continues running. As soon as awk sees that you've associated with that particular AP , the test condition [ \"String1\" != \"String2\" ] becomes false, loop breaks , and goes on to the echo DONE command. Of course , echo DONE is what can be replaced with the program that you want to run.\nThis command can be ran manually or placed into a script, and the script added to the Startup Application list.\nSimple, straightforward, and does the job. Like I said in the beginning, it is possible to use dbus , but is not as simple.\n", "Q: Keyboard stopped working on 15.10 I recently restarted after an update on 15.10, and now the keyboard on my laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga) doesn't work. I can't even ctrl-alt-[N] to get to a virtual terminal, nor does a USB keyboard work. The keyboard does work in BIOS setup and GRUB mode, but that's it. Also, the touchscreen stopped working at the same time. I had also changed a line in a xorg.conf.d file, affecting the synaptics driver prior to this, but I can't work out why this would kill the keyboard and touchscreen. \n\nA: OK; looks like the xorg.conf.d file was the problem; I dropped into a recovery boot and reverted that file. When it had the line Driver \"synaptics\" under InputClass the keyboard no longer worked. Reverting this to MatchDriver that was there previously (And I think is in error) meant I've got keyboard again.\n\nA: In my ubuntu 14.04 keyboard was working up to the grub menu, after that it stopped responding.\napart from this, my network also not working.\nSo, I have restarted ubuntu in recovery mode and selected a different kernel.\nNow both keyboard and network start working.\nWhat I understood from this is - my latest kernel failed to load these modules.\n", "Q: SSH Key with user and root with shell script Is it possible to ssh login to a server as a user with shell access and then change to root user both with the help of ssh key using a bash script?\n\nA: There are two ways you could do this:\nOne key: ssh directly from localhost to root@remote\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate a new keypair if you haven't already.\nssh-keygen -t dsa -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa -N \"\"\n\n\n*Copy the public key into the root account of the remote machine:\nssh user@remote sudo -i bash -c \"mkdir -p .ssh && cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys\" < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\n(You will need to enter one or two passwords.)\n\n\n*Test to see if it worked:\nssh root@remote.host\n\nTwo keys: ssh to user@remote using your local key, then ssh to root@remote using the user's key on the remote\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to the remote machine as the user\nssh user@remote.host\n\n\n*Create a key pair on the remote machine (follow step 1 above)\n\n*Copy the key into root's account:\nsudo -i bash -c \"mkdir -p .ssh && cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys\" < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\n\n*As user on remote, test it:\nssh root@localhost\n\n(No password required)\n\n\n*Log out and attempt both hops from your home machine:\nssh user@remote.host ssh root@localhost\n\n\n*If that works, now you can block root login attempts from external IPs.\nIssues\nIf the tests fail:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may need to check /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the remote host to ensure you have a line with no # comment:\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n\nand either:\nPermitRootLogin without-password\n\nor:\nPermitRootLogin yes\n\nIf you do need to change any lines, restart the ssh server afterwards:\nsudo -i service ssh restart\n\n\n*You may need to set a password for root on the remote machine (even if you don't intend to use it!):\nsudo -i passwd\n\nThat is not really desirable, but could be helpful for debugging.\nTo disable the root password again, run:\nsudo passwd -l root\n\n\nA: At the end of your ssh config file (/etc/ssh/shd_config probably), write:\nMatch User SomeUserName\n        ForceCommand echo \"*** Now Becoming Root ***\" && sudo -i\n\nyou would enter the passwords manually, if you are using passwords...\nanyhow, restart ssh to have the configuration file reloaded. \nsudo service ssh restart\n\n", "Q: Disabling 'auto-hiding' of application windows in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Suppose that there is Mozilla Firefox and Sublime Text open.

I am running it on Windows 7 Virtualbox.\nIs it safe to upgrade the Ununtu from inside the VM to latest version of Ubuntu?\nIs it possible at all?\n\nA: Upgrading Ubuntu in VirtualBox is the same as upgrading Ubuntu in a physical machine. The available direct upgrades are the next Ubuntu release and also the next Long Term Support release if you are upgrading from an existing Long Term Support release. \nThe problem with upgrading vs. a fresh install is that upgrading Ubuntu in VirtualBox takes 2-3 hours whereas a fresh install of Ubuntu takes only about a half hour, but you can still use Windows 7 while Ubuntu is upgrading. If you see a black screen during the upgrade, that is because the screensaver is running, and you can show the Ubuntu desktop screen again by moving the mouse. I have received a few error messages in the terminal while upgrading Ubuntu in VirtualBox which I ignored and let the upgrade continue to run, but despite the error messages I didn't have any problems with Ubuntu in VirtualBox after I upgraded it.\nYour personal data should be safe, but you should take the usual precautions about backing up your personal data that was in the Ubuntu guest OS before you start a distribution upgrade.\n\nA: Yes you can upgrade ...No problem with it\n", "Q: Shell very slow to load - Ubuntu 14.04 Opening my terminal (ctrl+alt+t), it takes a long time to load my prompt.

My laptop has this card, what should I do? What version of linux should I get?\n\nA: I think it is supported from linux 3.13 .... Install ubuntu 15.10 (which has kernel 4.2)\n\nA: According to this answer, the Linux kernel includes a driver for the RTL8723BE wireless network adapter chipset since (at least) version 3.13, which is included in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Alternatively the most recent release 15.10 has a newer kernel version that should work just as well.\n\nA: Actually there were/are problems with the Wifi chipset RTL8723BE. Here is a link to my blog post describing couple of my attempts to solve this with different kernels:\nhttps://artofcode.wordpress.com/2017/08/29/problems-with-wifi-signal-under-linux/\nOne conclusion: newest kernel doesn't automatically mean better support for this chipset.\nIt's not that bad if you can use antenna selection configuration. If I recall correctly this was the case with some kernels in versions 4.15.0-X where X < 33. With the kernel 4.15.0-33 you need to compile a kernel module which may be not obvious for less advanced users.\nIn worst case it was like that: antenna selection configuration was ignored and source code of an alternative kernel module was not compatible with the kernel...\nThe best is to try different Linux kernels using live versions.\n", "Q: Fan not spinning after suspend in new kernels (Asus X453M) More often than not, when my laptop is resumed after being suspended, the fan will no longer spin, resulting in overheating when a heavy process is running.\nThis happens on Ubuntu 14.04 with 3.13.0 and 3.19.0 kernels.\nI had no fan problems on Ubuntu 12.04 with a 3.5.0 kernel.\nA reboot (soft or hard) always starts the fan again.\nSomething which sometime works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutting the lid and waiting for some time.

I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows, so I downloaded the iso image. I then formatted my pendrive then using universal USB Installer I copied it to my USB and made it bootable. But after restarting I get grub> command line screen when I try to boot through my pendrive. \nI dont know how to proceed afterwards. I have tried using ls command to find all directories, I get hd0 hd1 hd2 hd2,gpt1..7,hd3. But when I try to access them it shows undefined directory. hd2,gpt1 and hd2,gpt2 have some folders like Windows/ Boot/ Efi. In the Boot/ folder there is a file named boot.efi.(something). I dont remember exactly. \n\nA: 1) Your USB drive needs to be formatted as FAT32\n2) I found https://rufus.akeo.ie/ to be very reliable for UEFI (recent, > 2009) systems (this may not be the case with universal USB installer)\n\nA: I have checked some Dell Manuals and I guess there should be something wrong with your USB Installer or ISO Image and you should try to format your USB as FAT32 \n\nA: Tools to create bootable USB drives from .iso files are not created equal. I'm not very familiar with the one you mention, so I can't comment on it specifically; but as a general rule, if you run into problems like those you describe, one of the first things (perhaps the first thing) I recommend doing is re-creating the USB drive with another tool. I generally use dd in Linux to make the drive; but Rufus (as Smile4ever recommends) and Unetbootin both seem to work pretty well. Even they might fail sometimes, though; unfortunately, some computers are just plain finicky, and if a disk isn't exactly to the firmware's liking, it might not boot or might exhibit other problems.\n", "Q: Cannot move file to trash after auto-mount in ubuntu 15.10 I have set my NTFS partition for auto-mount in Ubuntu 15.10 using the GUI utility as follows - \nAuto-mount settings\nAll the options provided are the defaults options.\nAfter I restart, the partition is automatically mounted. But the \"Move to trash\" option is missing when I right click on a file.\nIs there any way to fix this by using the window as given in the image above, without having to alter the rules by myself as mention in this page Cannot move file to trash warning when trying to delete a file in Nautilus since I'm not good in doing it?\n\nA: Don't forget to adapt /home/user/shared to your scenario. It is the place where your NTFS partition is mounted. Please note that the directory you specify must exist already, if not create it. It can be anywhere, but in the home folder it is easily accessible. So if your username is \"bart\", a good location would be /home/bart/ntfs:\nsudo mkdir /home/bart/ntfs\n\nAs you are saying you use an auto mount, you probably have a fixed location already (so the above command is unneccesary).\nCreating a trash, GUI method\nYou can do this in GUI by adding uid=1000 to the options just above mount point. Don't forget the comma :). Do a reboot to let this take effect.\nCreating a trash, CLI method\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/fstab with an editor, for example gedit:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n\n*Now add the option \"uid=1000\" to the NTFS mount line (something like this):\n/dev/sda3 /home/user/shared ntfs defaults,uid=1000,noatime 0 0\n\nThis will make you the owner and should create a .Trash-1000 folder where deleted files will be placed.\n\n\n*Once you have saved the fstab file, umount and remount the partition (or reboot your computer):\nsudo umount /dev/sda3 && sudo mount -a\n\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1499345\n\nA: I had the same problem.  I owned the Trash folder, so that was not the problem.  This worked for me:\nEdit /etc/fstab or use gnome-disks so that the mount is not auto.\nMount with both of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*File system must be ntfs-3g\n\n*Option uid=1000 must be used.\n\n\nMy fstab has it like this:\nLABEL=HOME /mnt/HOME ntfs-3g nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show,uid=1000 0 0\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mounting as \"ntfs\" did not work\n\n*Mounting as ntfs-3g without uid=1000 did not work.\n\n\nMust do both.\n", "Q: How To Run Program, installed from source To give you a little background: I am currently running on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and want to use the application pan newsreader.

From a terminal window use genisoimage to create the .iso file.

With the -l and the -D options you can change this up to 31 characters and more than 6 levels.\nOther options allow you to set a volume label (-V), to insert a copyright of up to 37 characters (-copyright) or to exclude up to 1000 individual files.\n", "Q: GNOME classic on Ubuntu 15?

Please, how can I delete that iso file? If I deleted it in Windows, Ubuntu didn't start.\n\nA: You have to open the Virtual Media Manager window. Under Ubuntu's Virtual Box it is located under File -> Virtual Media Managers. Then you can go to the Optical disks tab and delete the iso image from there. Once deleted, you can remove the actual iso image file stored on your Windows host.\n\nIn addition, I would recommend to open the settings of your virtual machine and delete the iso image from the  Storage tab. Typically if you delete actual iso image, the virtual box will complain and you have to remove the iso from list in Virtual Media Manager like I said before, but just to avoid extra unforseen issues , delete it from Storage tab as well\n", "Q: Compare the first field of each line whose first field is \"2000\" till a different field is found My goal is to compare the first field of each line whose first field is \"2000\" till I find a different field.\nLet say the different field is located in line number 6, as in the provided example; in that case I'd ask Bash to print line number 5, which is the line before the line \"No Living Leaves\":\n  2000 255    17.    11.     0.    30.  0.05  97. 0.110  6.7  6.7  596. 0.03 0.27  0  0\n  2000 256    17.    11.     0.    30.  0.05  97. 0.109  6.7  6.7  596. 0.03 0.22  0  0\n  2000 257    17.    11.     0.    30.  0.05  97. 0.109  6.7  6.7  596. 0.02 0.20  0  0\n  2000 258    17.    11.     0.    30.  0.05  97. 0.109  6.7  6.7  596. 0.02 0.16  0  0\n  2000 259    17.    11.     0.    30.  0.05  97. 0.109  6.6  6.6  596. 0.02 0.18  0  0\n  No Living leaves\n\n\nA: From the comments bellow kos's answer it is apparent that you want to print last line before one that differs.

On my ubuntu 15.10 with unity this works fine using the command setxkbmap de us.\nThe problem is, I have to run this command after every boot/after every wakeup from sleep. How can I configure my system to permanently use the mentioned layout? I know I can use some form of autostart (unity's or .xinitrc), however this won't work after suspend. I also read about setting the layout in org.gnome.desktop.input-sources here, but this won't give the desired results using the string 'de+us'.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Note for other searchers landing on this page: this is apparently peculiar to the de-us layout in the Unity environment, because for some reason it lacks an entry in a particular configuration file.\n\nHow keyboard data is stored in Ubuntu\nIn Ubuntu, there is a folder called /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols which contains a few subfolders as well as a number of text files, each representing a different layout.  Most, if not all, of these layouts, have a number of variants.  The one we're interested in is the us variant of the de keyboard, so we open the file de and scroll down to the following entry (it was at line 686 for me, but I'm not on 15.10).\npartial alphanumeric_keys\nxkb_symbols \"us\" {\n    include \"us\"\n\n    name[Group1]=\"German (US keyboard with German letters)\";\n\n    key <AC01> { [           a,          A, adiaeresis, Adiaeresis ] };\n    key <AC02> { [           s,          S,     ssharp,     ssharp ] };\n    key <AC10> { [   semicolon,      colon, odiaeresis, Odiaeresis ] };\n    key <AC11> { [  apostrophe,   quotedbl, adiaeresis, Adiaeresis ] };\n    key <AD03> { [           e,          E,   EuroSign,   EuroSign ] };\n    key <AD07> { [           u,          U, udiaeresis, Udiaeresis ] };\n    key <AD09> { [           o,          O, odiaeresis, Odiaeresis ] };\n    key <AD11> { [ bracketleft,  braceleft, udiaeresis, Udiaeresis ] };\n    key <AE03> { [           3, numbersign,    section,    section ] };\n    key <AE11> { [       minus, underscore,     ssharp,   question ] };\n\n    include \"level3(ralt_switch)\"\n};\n\nThis defines the keyboard to be identical to the standard QWERTY variety us, with changes to\n\n\n*\n\n*keys 1 (A), 2 (S), 10 (;), and 11 (') on the home row\n\n*keys 3 (E), 7 (U), 9 (O), and 11 ([) on the top row\n\n*keys 3 (3) and 11 (-) on the numbers row\n\n*the ALT key used to access the special characters\n\n\nWe check that it's properly formatted, not missing any brackets or anything, and it is.  This is why setxkbmap de us succeeds, if only temporarily.  We'll copy the description from this entry later on.\nHow Ubuntu accesses that data\nUbuntu has a registry setting where it saves the name of the keyboard or keyboards the user wants.  However, we have to fix an entry in another configuration file before Ubuntu will accept our preferred keyboard.  The file that needs to be modified is /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml.\nThis file has three major sections:\n\n\n*\n\n*a list of known keyboard models (describing the physical arrangement of buttons)\n\n*a list of known keyboard layouts (describing the logical assignment of characters to keys)\n\n*a list of options (describing possible modifications to the layout)\n\n\nWe need to open this as root so we can save it later.  Since we want to use the us variant of the de layout, the relevant portion of the file is going to be the second section- specifically, we modify the German layout (in my copy, this begins on line 3176).\n<layout>\n  <configItem>\n    <name>de</name>\n\n    <shortDescription>de</shortDescription>\n    <description>German</description>\n    <languageList>\n      <iso639Id>ger</iso639Id>\n    </languageList>\n  </configItem>\n  <variantList>\n    <variant>\n      <configItem>\n        <name>us</name>\n        <description>German (US keyboard with German letters)</description>\n      </configItem>\n    </variant>\n\nNotice the structure of this section.  Each layout contains a configuration and multiple variants.  I've added a new variant entry (the last six lines), immediately after the tag opening variantList, the content of which matches what I found in the keyboard data file above.\nAfter saving, change the registry setting to select our newly added entry:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources [('xkb', 'de+us')]\n\nI found it necessary to log out and back in for this change to take effect, but after that, the layout worked as one would hope, including surviving suspend/resume cycles.\n\nA: Add new script into /etc/pm/sleep.d, name it 20_my-layout\ncase \"${1}\" in\n    resume|thaw)\n        DISPLAY=:0.0 ; export DISPLAY\n        setxkbmap de us\n;;\nesac\n\nSource: How to execute a command after resume from suspend?\n\nA: TL:DR add the command\nsetxkbmap de us\n\nin the files ~/.gnomerc and ~/.zshrc.\nFound this solution while I implemented the detailed solution provided by Aoeuid. During this I stumbled over the already existing 'de(us)'-Section in the file /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/de that contains almost the same configuration as listed in Aoeuid's solution.\nThis section is also part of the solution described at https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/589273\nAbout my environment\nDebian 11.2.0 (Bullseye), 64-bit\nGNOME Version 3.38.5\nWindowing System X11\n\n", "Q: Using already installed Windows from Ubuntu I have both Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 installed on my system.

By the way, I'm using Ubuntu Gnome 14.04.\n\nA: First, I'd recommend using an xterm alternative instead of customizing it.\nBut since you asked, there is this utility called xfontsel (in the x11-utils package) that gives you the font names for font resources.

I am not asking for the full script, I am new (-ish) to Ubuntu, and I do not know how to access files on another drive, but i know that C:/Windows/System32/ will not work. I do not know  how to access those files with the command line, (the script) and would like help on this.\nI am running Ubuntu 15.10\n\nA: G'day Ty,\nThis doesn't sound like something you'd need a script for, unless you were intending on repeating the action multiple times (say, more than twice).  Anything less would just be creating more work and possible points of failure.  To write a script would require more in-depth knowledge of exactly how your computer and drives are set up, or would have to make assumptions which may be incorrect.  I hope you don't mind if I give you step-by-step instead.  I've also provided the rough commandline equivalents to each step.\nTo accomplish what you're asking, your main steps would appear to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*mounting the correct partition read/write\n\n*renaming the relevant files\n\n*saving changes/unmounting (ensuring writes-to-disk)\n\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu on one drive, and the windows drive is physically separate, then it's likely (but not definite) that your Ubuntu drive will be referenced as /dev/sda, and the Windows drive as /dev/sdb.  You can do most (if not all) of what you want in GUI programs though.\nManual Steps\nFirstly, you'll want to open the Disk Utility (see https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/disk-partitions.html) - you should be able to find this easily enough by simply typing 'disk' into the Dash.\nThis will present you with a graphical representation of your disks (including hard drives), and from here you should be able to get the mounting part sorted.\nFind your Windows partition (this will be easier if it's labelled or you recognise the approximate size), and try clicking it to select it, then click the little play symbol that shows up on it.  That will attempt to mount the partition.  If it works, it'll give you a text link you can click, to open that location where it's been mounted to, in your default file manager.  If that's successful, you can skip the next two paragraphs.\nIf it doesn't work, and brings up an error about the filesystem being 'unclean', 'not safely shut down', or 'hibernation file present', we'll need to go through an additional step or two in order to get the partition mounted properly so that you can make changes.\nFor any of the above errors, one workaround is to boot into Windows 10, press Win+R, type \"shutdown /s /t 0\" into the Run box and press Enter.  This should execute a proper shut down, rather than hibernation or 'hybrid shutdown' which causes such problems.\nOnce you've got a Windows partition that can be mounted writeable without errors, you can navigate to the drive using the handy link provided by the Disk Utility, saunter on into your Windows folder, and make your changes.  You can rename files by right-clicking them and choosing Rename, or by pressing the F2 key when they're selected.\nOnce you're done, you can use 'Eject' or 'Unmount' in the right-click menu on that drive, in the left hand pane of the file manager, or return to Disk Utility and use the Stop icon for that partition there.\nIf you run into any bumps along this road, just post back whatever information you have on the new problem, and I'll endeavour to assist you further :)\nCommand line equivalents\nList all drives and their partitions: sudo fdisk -l\nThis should allow you to work out which partition is your Windows one, based on size - you can also use the Disk Utility to determine this information to use in your scripts, as the /dev/sdX-style enumeration is displayed underneath when you select a partition in the interface.  I'll assume /dev/sdb2 for the following instructions.\nCreate a location at which to mount your Windows partition: sudo mkdir -p /mnt/win\nThe -p parameter is used to avoid errors if the destination already exists (but will still show any other relevant errors).\nAttempt to mount the Windows partition, letting the system do all the guesswork: sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/win\nIf this fails, attempt mounting with some typical options: sudo mount -t ntfs -o defaults,locale=en_US.utf8,rw /dev/sdb2 /mnt/win\nChange to the relevant folder: cd /mnt/win/Windows/System32\n(case matters, though you can use the Tab key for auto-completion after you've typed the first couple of letters of each folder)\nRename the files in question: mv Utilman.exe Utilman.bak\nThen cp cmd.exe Utilman.exe\nUnmount the partition to ensure changes are saved: umount /mnt/win\nIf you use a mount point under /media (e.g, /media/ty/win) then your file manager should also have the partition show up in its sidebar - but again, to script this we'd need to know more information (in this case, your username).\nIf you need further clarification please let me know.\n\nA: You need to mount the drive (assuming it's not already mounted) with\nmkdir ~/Windows ; sudo mount /dev/sdb ~/Windows\n\nFrom there you can run\ncd ~/Windows\n\nAnd you will have the filesystem from your windows machine.  Keep in mind, this filesystem can be finicky with some of the newer Windows versions.  You may have to enter the Windows OS and disable Quick Boot or Hibernation, depending on what version it is.  Simple way to shut down cleanly in Windows is\nshutdown /s /t 0\n\nThat should perform a full shutdown in Windows.  Now you can cd and mv around just as if you were in Linux.  Just make sure you use / instead of \\ in filepaths.\n\nNow. for my question to you: Why on earth are you trying to rename Utilman.exe and cmd.exe?  And why do you need to do this multiple times?  We here on Stack Exchange aren't just here to provide answers, we're here to help make sure you don't do something dangerous, irresponsible, or foolish.\n", "Q: Can't drag files from Dolphin to Chrome Up until a couple of weeks ago, when I would try to drag and drop files from Dolphin (the default File Manager in Kubuntu) to Chrome (e.g., to add to an email or upload a video to youtube), there were no problems.

It is not possible to use an old ICD2 in GNU/Linux with the old MPLAB IDE or MPLAB X, but you may use Piklab to use the ICD2. The issue here is that Piklab is not as a good IDE as the old MPLAB. I have used the old MPLAB under Wine in Ubuntu 12.04 very succesfully, programming the ICD2 from Piklab. It is not as smooth as you may wish, but it works. The other option is to use the ICD3 with MPLAB X; this is fully supported to work under GNU/Linux.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run GUI programs without a desktop installed?

When I use LXDE on another system, I can run gksudo gedit to launch the program but this command isn't recognised in this case. Also, running sudo gedit results in the message \"Cannot open display:\".\n\nA: The Xorg server is what takes care of drawing a graphical environment. When Xorg is launched, it also launches an application with a GUI. When this application exits, so does Xorg (if I recall correctly). In Ubuntu, this application is the Unity desktop environment.\nYou should be able to install a barebones Xorg server, and use the command line (I think xinit gedit should do it) to make it launch the application you want. Alternatively, you can install a lightweight window manager like Openbox. These are typically less user-friendly than full-blown desktop environments like Gnome, Unity and KDE Plasma, but they are also a lot smaller and faster.\n", "Q: Ubuntu live USB won't start with CSM disabled I copied files from the ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso to a FAT32 formated USB drive. When I boot on the USB and select Ubuntu live the startup get stuck at a black screen with the message Ignoring BGRT: invalid status 0 (expected 1). Additionally it sometimes (sometimes no) cause my UEFI to boot very slow afterwards, I have to cut the power off to restore a normal speed boot (https://superuser.com/questions/1023102/uefi-startup-randomly-gets-longer). This happens when I have CSM disabled on my motherboard, if I enable CSM and boot ubuntu in UEFI mode it starts fine.\nAny idea on what is happening ?\nEdit : I have to add that when CSM support is enabled the screen resolution is low while when it's disabled the resolution is high. So could this be because of some kind of graphical drivers or something ?\nEdit : In the CSM compatibility menu I have 3 option :\nLaunch PXE OpROM Policy\nLaunch Storage OpROM Policy\nLaunch Video OpROM Policy\n\nFor each I can chose UEFI only or Legacy Only. The only one I need to run in Legacy mode only in order to avoid the bug on ubuntu is Video OpROM policy any idea on what the problem might be ? (this is what make my screen resolution be high or low, low for Legacy, high for UEFI)\n\nA: Okay after removing quiet from the kernel options I saw that the error message was fb : switching from nouveaufb to EFI VGA and I saw a thread on the internet that said adding nomodeset to kernel options was solving the problem and it does indeed whatever it is.\n\nA: I see you've found a workaround. My suspicion is that the cause is that enabling the CSM is changing the way the EFI interacts with the video hardware. I've seen this on one of my own computers, which shows a lower-resolution display during EFI-mode booting when I activate the CSM than when it's inactive. Another possibility is that the kernel is able to use the CSM-provided video interfaces but has problems with the EFI interfaces provided by your firmware. Either situation is likely to be an indication of a firmware bug, so updating your firmware (what the manufacturer probably calls a \"BIOS\") may be in order.\nOrdinarily, I recommend leaving the CSM disabled when you want to boot in EFI mode, since activating the CSM complicates the boot path, which creates possibilities for things to go wrong. The sort of problem you've encountered is one of the exceptions to this rule, though.\n", "Q: Error while burning CD-R, check if it's burned correctly I tried to write an .iso file on a CD-R, but I got an error in process.\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_set_current_action\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_get_session_output_size\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_set_current_action\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_get_session_output_size\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_set_current_action\nBraseroLibburn SCSI error condition on command 5Ch READ BUFFER CAPACITY: See MMC specs: Sense Key 3 \"Medium error\", ASC 10 ASCQ 00\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_get_session_output_size\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_set_current_action\nBraseroLibburn SCSI error condition on command 2Ah WRITE(10): [5 64 00] Illegal mode for this track\nBraseroLibburn Closing\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_set_dangerous\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_set_current_action\nBraseroLibburn Libburn reported an error SCSI error on write(1136,16): [5 64 00] Illegal mode for this track\nBraseroLibburn called brasero_job_error\nBraseroLibburn finished with an error\nBraseroLibburn asked to stop because of an error\n    error       = 1\n    message = \"SCSI error on write(1136,16): [5 64 00] Illegal mode for this track\"\nBraseroLibburn stopping\nSession error : SCSI error on write(1136,16): [5 64 00] Illegal mode for this track (brasero_burn_record brasero-burn.c:2856)\n\nWhen I opened the resulted disk, most files are ended up written there, but I'm not sure if that's all of them.

Suggest using regular logout method, if you started with startx it should go back to character mapped text display.\nIf you still see the graphical login, and/or if you don't care to save changes or logout normally, or if something has crashed, sometimes I will run from the virtual tty killall -u $(whoami) which get things done rather fast. Looking forward to also trying killall xinit which sounds effective. Both are fairly brutal ways.\nYou can logout of graphical while keeping a terminal running with tmux. You need to start tmux before you realise the job is long mind.\nI want a long running terminal app to keep running through my logout and terminate X11, I will go ctrl-alt-f4 to login on the \"black and white\" screen, then su to myself (or another user if I wanna do killall user), then start a tmux session, then ctrl-alt-f1 back to the GUI and go:\ntmux attach\nI can then alt-F4 this or logout and session is still there.\n", "Q: How to get backup and restore the software from a unbootable hard drive I have an Ubuntu partition that is unbootable although still mountable, and I'd like to create a newly installed system with the exact same packages as this system. The way to restore the list of packages I assume is to mount the unbootable root partition during a live-usb session and navigate to the /mnt/var/lib/dpkg/ folder assuming its mounted on /mnt and perform sudo dpkg -l --admindir > ~/Packages.list which would produce a list file which could be manipulated to include 2 columns, one for the package name and the second is the word install. Then follow the something similar as the advice in this link. The problem is how to retrieve the apt keys from the unbootable partition. \nI have seen many site that show how to backup and restore the apt keys from a bootable OS partition. The way to do this found at this link. There seems to be no information about how to automate the backup of keys from the mounted partition (un-bootable).  \nIn a nutshell I would like to perform sudo apt-key add ~/Repo.keys in the newly installed system and retrieve all keys for Repo.keys. How to create this file from an unbootable system is what I need. \nCan I just copy the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg file over to the new system and that's it? Or maybe a way to export the keys to a text file or something?\n\nA: Mount the drive from the live-usb session, do chroot /mnt (assuming the drive is mounted at /mnt), followed by the first three lines from this answer (as if the drive were bootable). Depending on the exact directory structure on that drive, you may need to replace ~/ with some directory that you know exists.\n", "Q: Having problems while building or running a code using Codeblocks 13.12 One of my mates told me that she is having problem while trying to build or run a code in Codeblocks (version 13.12).

If I install it on the SSD is there any SSD optimization I should take care of so that Grub reduces the number of writes?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: The \"noatime\" is an extx filesystem attribute, which may have an equivalent for ntfs, but will probably be called something different.  The purpose of the SSD optimizations is to reduce the number of writes, and you certainly don't want to force a write to update the time you read a file, so you would want that particular optimization if it exists for ntfs.  Apply only the optimization which make sense, i.e. system related ones probably don't apply, unless you want some performance improvement instead of a longevity improvement.  \nThe Windows bootloader -- can't say.  \nGrub on the SSD does not write much, and will certainly improve boot speed.  That said, If you want to put grub on the HDD, you can leave the SSD untouched (assuming you can boot either).

So I've been trying figure out where Ubuntu saves all the program information for installed programs. Is there a config file or a log that an app like Crossover would write when it was installed?

I'm trying to figure out how to fork/clone a terminal that retains the history of its parent.\nI understand there are solutions that allow all terminals to share a history, but this is not quite what I'm after.\nSometimes I am working in a directory and realize I need an additional terminal - but still want easy access to the command history in that terminal without switching back and forth to its parent.\nNote: There is no need for the two terminals to continue updating each other's history once the child is spawned.\nExample: \n\n\n*\n\n*Super-long-weird-command-executed-in-terminal-1\n\n*Need an additional terminal - Terminal 2 has entered the game.\n\n*After some time, I end up launching nano in Terminal 1\n\n*Need that super long command from Terminal 1 - but luckily its in the history of Terminal 2!\n\n\nA: In a nutshell:\nTo open a new terminal window with the same full history as the current session, run:\n history -a && gnome-terminal\n\nFull explanation:\nThe Bash history works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You open a terminal which starts a Bash session. \n\n*Bash loads the old history from $HISTFILE, which is usually ~/.bash_history.\n\n*You can enter commands into the Bash shell. Those commands will be stored in a temporary history in memory.\n\n*You exit the Bash session or close the terminal window.\n\n*Before Bash terminates, it synchronizes the temporary history in memory with the one saved in $HISTFILE on the disk. \n\n\nNote that for both the temporary and the persistent history may have size limits and get truncated when they become too long.\nAs each Bash instance only writes to a temporary history in your memory, the actions from a running session do not appear if you start a second session in parallel: It will load the old version of the persistent history file!\n\nIf you need to synchronize the temporary histories of two Bash instances, you need to do this via the persistent history file. There is a command to help you: history\n\n\n*\n\n*To flush the current Bash session's temporary history from RAM to the $HISTFILE on the disk by appending the new command lines to it, you run:\n history -a\n\nThis command gets automatically invoked whenever you exit a Bash session.\n\n*To re-read the $HISTFILE from the disk and add the new command lines from it to the current Bash session's temporary history which you can use, you run:\n history -r\n\nThis command gets automatically invoked whenever you start a Bash session.\nNote the leading space in front of both history commands. It prevents that the history command itself will appear in the Bash history. If you want it to appear there, just omit the space at the beginning.\n\nSo to open a new terminal window that has access to all the current history, you need to flush the current temporary history first, and then open a new terminal with a new Bash session:\n history -a && gnome-terminal\n\nAgain, note the space in the beginning to prevent this command to appear in the histories. If you want it to appear there, omit the space in front of the command.\nIf you want a short command for that, create a Bash alias:\necho \"alias newterminal='history -a && gnome-terminal'\" >> .bash_aliases\n\nYou could also add a context menu entry to the Gnome-Terminal launcher if you want. Ask for it in a comment if you need it.\n\nTo synchronize the histories of two already open terminal windows, first flush the history of the first window, then reload the history file in the second window:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal 1 (source):\n history -a\n\n\n*Terminal 2 (target):\n history -r\n\nIf you need a two-ways synchronisation, first run the history -a commands on all windows, then run the history -r everywhere.\n\nMore information about the history command can be found when you execute\nhelp history\n\n", "Q: couldn't find IP in eth0 I have installed Ubuntu 14.04.

The current release provides full\n access to POSIX, plus important non-POSIX extensions, such as\n complete sockets support. \"Full access to POSIX\" means: fork, exec &\n wait, sockets, full read, write, open & close, seek & tell, complete\n file-system access, including stat, chmod/chgrp/chown, symlink, FIFO\n & directory access, tty & pty support, file locking, pipes, select,\n file-name pattern-matching, time & date, environment variables,\n signal handlers, and more.\n .\n This package contains the architecture-independent files.\nDescription-md5: b67b8d361914d72dc0e5b30aaca2650b\nHomepage: http://www.scsh.net/\nBugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug\nOrigin: Ubuntu\n\nThe installation process is marked by dpkg this way:\nemd@luna:~/Downloads$ dpkg -l | sed -n '1,5p; /scsh/p'\nDesired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold\n| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend\n|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)\n||/ Name                                                        Version                                    Architecture Description\n+++-===========================================================-==========================================-============-===============================================================================\niU  scsh-0.6:i386                                               0.6.7-8                                    i386         A `scheme' interpreter designed for writing system programs\nii  scsh-0.6-doc                                                0.6.7-8                                    all          Documentation for scsh, \"The Scheme Shell\"\nii  scsh-common-0.6                                             0.6.7-8                                    all          A `scheme' interpreter designed for writing system programs\n\nOnly differences I see is that the package scsh wants scsh-common-0.6:i386 but the provided package is scsh-common-0.6:all... but that shouldn't matter should it?\nAlso, I'm also running:\nemd@luna:~/Downloads$ cat /etc/*release*\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=15.10\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=wily\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 15.10\"\nNAME=\"Ubuntu\"\nVERSION=\"15.10 (Wily Werewolf)\"\nID=ubuntu\nID_LIKE=debian\nPRETTY_NAME=\"Ubuntu 15.10\"\nVERSION_ID=\"15.10\"\nHOME_URL=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\"\nSUPPORT_URL=\"http://help.ubuntu.com/\"\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/\"\nemd@luna:~/Downloads$ uname -a\nLinux luna 4.2.0-23-generic #28-Ubuntu SMP Sun Dec 27 17:47:31 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n\nA: I did more research on this problem, and found an Ubuntu bug listed against scsh on this topic. This bug references a Debian bug on the topic. The problem is that there is no scsh-0.6 build on the amd64 platform. There is no direct scsh 64-bit build. The \"fix\" (as shown in the Debian bug report) is to recompile the code, forcing it to compile for ia32 despite running on amd64. This breaks other code, but when you need it, you need it.\nIt took a few tweaks to get the source to build properly with Wily (the patches are against older versions).\nAfter building the deb files, install them with:\ndpkg -i scsh*.deb\n\nAnd finally, add /usr/bin/scsh:\ncd /usr/bin\nln -s scsh-0.6 scsh\n\n(Why this last step isn't automated, I have no idea.)\n", "Q: Why does alias in /etc/bash.bashrc not apply to sudo? I've added the line \nalias ll='ls -l'\n\nto the /etc/bash.bashrc. After a restart, the alias ll from that file affects me, which I checked by commenting out the corresponding alias in my ~/.bashrc (and logging out and back in after that edit). However, it seems to not affect root, as when I type sudo ll, I get \"no such command\". Shouldn't the alias work in any situation if it's in the system-wide .bashrc?\n\nA: sudo will ignore any aliased commands from .bashrc.\nYou can work around this by creating an alias for sudo too --> alias sudo='sudo '\nYou need the space after sudo, since man tells us:\nIf the last character of the alias value is a blank, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.\n\n", "Q: Lost Menu and Taskbar Inadvertently clicked something that removed menu and taskbar in 15.10.

Not all that tech savvy. Thanks\n\nA: You may have just \"hidden\" the menu. \"Slap\" (bounce your cursor into) the mouse (cursor) into the top-left corner of the screen, and see if it pops up / appears.\nIf it is indeed \"lost\", someone else more savvy than I may be able to answer this.

When I don't have IP forwarding and Masquerading enabled (via the script in that article) it all works as expected but as soon as I use that script the forwarded ports do not work.\nI've obviously missed something and do not know enough about iptables to figure out how I can still forward traffic from p4p1 to tun0 and still allow external access via the forwarded ports.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated - if you'd be willing to provide an explanation of the solution you provide I would love to understand whats going on further.\nThank you!\n\nA: Your problem is likely occurring due to the following rule:\n-A FORWARD -i \"$EXTIF\" -o \"$INTIF\" -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT \n\nThis is only accepting RELATED or ESTABLISHED connections passing into the tun0 (external) interface and out of the p4p1 (internal) interface, so when outside connections attempt to connect to your port-forwarded service, the connection is dropped because it is NEW. You must modify that rule to either exclude the conntrack module altogether, or include the NEW parameter.\nEither of the two below rules should solve your issue:\n-A FORWARD -i \"$EXTIF\" -o \"$INTIF\" -j ACCEPT\n\n\n-A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Network icon on unity panel gone in Ubuntu 15.10 I recently noticed that the Network / Wifi icon is missing in Ubuntu 15.10 unity panel.

I cannot find anything under 'edit connections' for that matter.\nthanks\n\nA: To connect to a hidden wireless network:\n1. Click on NetworkManager in the top panel.\n2. Select Connect to a hidden wireless network. Ubuntu will then open\nthe “Connect to Hidden Wireless Network” window.\n3. In the Network name field, enter the name of the network. This is also\nknown as the ssid (Service Set Identifier). You must enter the name exactly\nhow it was given to you. For example, if the name is “UbuntuWireless,”\nentering “ubuntu-wireless” will not work as the “U” and “W”\nare both uppercase in the correct name.\n4. In the Wireless security field, select one of the options. If the network\nis an open network, leave the field set to “None.” If you do not know the\ncorrect setting for the field, you will not be able to connect to the hidden\nnetwork.\n5. Click the Connect button. If the network is secure, you will be prompted\nfor the password. Provided you have entered all of the details correctly,\nthe network should then connect, and you will receive an on-screen\nnotification informing you that the connection was a success.\nAs is the case with visible wireless networks, hidden wireless network\nsettings will be saved once a connection is made, and the wireless network\nwill then appear in the list of saved connections.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu Core mature enough for commercial production?

Well I'm building a computer and the components are windows compatible in description, so if i get them and run Ubuntu in BIOS, will they work?\n\nA: Windows and Linux are not comparable. \n\"Windows compatible\" tells you nothing about \"Ubuntu compatible\" and the other way round.\n\nA: Hello and welcome on Ask Ubuntu!\nAll of those components which has the corresponding drivers in kernel or has proprietary support are compatible. Windows and GNU/Linux systems have different structures so drivers are not universal - except for some network card you can try to get working with NDISWrapper.\nSince your question has the tag 'graphics' I assume you would like to know that does your VGA have support. In case you have Ati/AMD or nVidia card or an Intel IGP I can surely tell you - absolutely have! (aside from rare exceptions, but without any clue that is the most detailed answer I can tell).\n\nA: As other answers have stated, unfortunately the moniker \"Windows Compatible\" promises only that the hardware will work in windows.\nHardware support in the linux kernel is and has been very good for recent years.\nMost graphics hardware from Intel, AMD and NVIDIA will usually worth, but still check, sometimes drivers for cutting edge cards are a bit late on linux, and sometimes older cards have limited support. All intel and amd x86 based processors will work, and additionally any motherboards which support them, along with memory which is standardised and will also always work.\nHarddrives will always work.\nIn general however I would still recommend checking online for each piece of hardware you plan to purchase, and see if anyone has mentioned any incompatibilities.\nIf you plan to use wifi, I would defiantly suggest checking this, and any dedicated sound cards (rare these days), or any other obscure hardware you intend on purchasing.\nBe aware that any hardware which come with specialised software will probably, unless stated not work, or not work to their full potential (I'm thinking gaming mice and keyboards here).\nSpecialist hardware such as drawing tablets, also are worth checking first.\ntldr; If you care about wasting money, check everything just to be sure, but generally these days most things work on linux.\n\nA: The words \"compatible with windows\" guarantees to you that parts support Windows, but this does not exclude the compatibility with Ubuntu. The answer is therefore a maybe. Not all components are compatible with Ubuntu and Linux. I suggest you do a search to see if the components are compatible.\n", "Q: Landscape on IBM Power 824s Has any one got Landscape standalone working on IBM Power8 824s system?

Now execute\nsudo parted -l\n\nand find out which one is your installed Ubuntu's root partition. You'll need the device file of drive (/dev/sdX) and the partition number of your root partition (hereafter called Y), being formatted ext4 or btrfs.\nAfter you found that out, use\nsudo mkdir /mnt/ububtu\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/ubuntu\n\nto mount the root partition.

(Yes, I know that shared libraries are much more resource efficient, but I don't care much about it).\nI would like to know if the Linux ecosystem has something similar to self-contained programs. You know, something like Windows's portable programs that are stored in one directory, dependencies and all, or something like Mac OS's app directories.\nSome time ago someone mentioned to me Ubuntu Core's Snappy system, suggesting that it might be what I am looking for. I did some research on the web, and I found out that Snappy is not meant to work on a normal desktop installation of Linux, being meant for things like Raspberry Pi devices etc.\nCould someone confirm to me that Snappy cannot be used on a normal Ubuntu desktop installation? If it can, how can I do it?\nAny other suggestions about an alternative to Snappy (even on distros other than Ubuntu) would be very welcome.\nThanks a lot,\nHerb\n\nA: You're right-- Snappy sounds exactly like what you're looking for, while retaining the ability to have shared libraries. However, you're also right, currently they do not run on Ubuntu Desktop. However, that will change as of Ubuntu 16.04 (due to be released in April). You can see early efforts to accomplish this here.\nBeyond that, it's worth noting that you can accomplish a lot of what you're trying to do via static linking.

The numbers after the resolution 1920x1080+0+0 are the offset. It's important to add this offset according to your needs.

(/etc/hosts) This local link will work even if the computer does not have an internet connection.\nAccessing from the server IP sends a connection through the internet. Your connection would get routed to the destination (server IP) via the server's internet connection on wlan0 or eth0, depending on the setup.\nIf the server is behind a router, you will need to forward port 8080 to the server's internal IP address, otherwise the connection will be stopped at the router. If you still can't connect, then you need to make sure that the port is open on your ISP, as well as on your computer's firewall.\n", "Q: Desktop is distorted, launcher in the middle, double image, bad resolution I am very new to Ubuntu. I followed this YouTube tutorial on replacing Windows with Ubuntu on my crummy laptop. When the installer loaded up there were resolution problems where two versions of the screen were being displayed at once, with an overlap in the middle (almost like a venn diagram). I assumed this was a little glitch and that it would disappear after finishing the installation. As far as I can tell, it didn't. A couple of reboots later, it's still there.\nI am running the 64-bit version of 14.04.3 LTS. The laptop has Nvidia graphics (could it be as simple as trying the 32-bit version? I have the specs for 64!)\n\n\nA: Have you tried updating device drivers?\nGo into the dash menu and open Additional Drivers and select the latest proprietary driver on the list. It should say something like NVIDIA Binary Driver. Afterwards, press Apply Changes and then reboot.\nIt should look something like this:\n\nIf you have an Optimus laptop, you might need to install Bumblebee.\nIf you can't use the settings menu because of your display issues, you can install proprietary drivers if you manage to get into a shell by typing:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\n\nThis will install Nvidia's 352.63 driver which is the latest stable one at the time of posting as far as I know (future readers may need to adjust the command.

I've ruled out ZFS because it just doesn't expand/grow well. My current NAS is mdadm / ext4, no complaints. But, everyone is saying how great btrfs will be \"some day\". Most of the comments on it are a year old. The Ubuntu wiki on it hasn't been updated since 2013.\nI've decided I will try btrfs. I've got decent backup capabilities and I can let this thing run for a few months before making it 'production' to get a good feel. \nThe first step was upgrading the kernel to one of the latest. This is where I don't understand things very well. I'm running 14.04.3 just because of the LTS. There is no 4.X 'ubuntu kernel' for trusty (14.04.3) yet. I'm assuming the LTS is part of that reason. \nI downloaded the 4.3.3 Wily kernel instead. Things seem fine (meaning it rebooted and didn't die). \nSo, two questions. \n\n\n*\n\n*Will I regret running the 4.3.3 Wily kernel on a Trusty build?\n\n*Would it be better to run btrfs under Ubuntu 15.X? \n\n\nAny other thoughts/comments are welcome. \nThank you in advance for taking the time to read this. \n\nA: I think there is no definite answer to your question. Although sometimes there are regressions introduced in Linux Kernel, in general you would always be better off when you run the latest stable kernel you can get. I think this statement is true for every aspect of computing on Linux,  btrfs being no exception. But no one will tell you how much exactly it is.\nWhat makes developers flag something as \"stable\" is not a single event like adding a killer feature, but rather a intuitive/statistical impression of the time trend of the severity and quantity of discovered bugs in the code. \nPersonally I am using almost exclusively btrfs for 3-5 machines for at least 3 years in various configurations (mixed with layers of lvm, software RAID, bcache and LUKS; I use no btrfs RAID, but I do use snapshots). For last 2 years I found no serious problems with it. \n\nA: Will I regret running the 4.3.3 Wily kernel on a Trusty build?\n\nYes. the idea about LTS Releases is that you are going to use packages only from the release, updates, backports and PPAs for this version. You maybe don't have problems now using the manually kernel from wily, but, if you have some problem or need updates and is related with kernel packages, don't expect any official support from Canonical or the community.\nNow, if you are using 14.04 LTS, you can have support extended for kernel packages and xorg via LTS Enablement Stack (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack) that gives to you, updates for kernel and xorg from non-LTS version that come later. Now (2016) you can install kernel backported from wily and xenial beta.\nWould it be better to run btrfs under Ubuntu 15.X?\n\nNo, because non LTS releases only have support for 9 months and if you like to put this in production, you will need to update from 15.04 to 15.10 before use 16.04 LTS now.\nAny other thoughts/comments are welcome. \n\nToday you can try wily (or xenial) kernel from LTS Enablement Stack. But my recommendation is: wait some weeks for release for 16.04 LTS or try 16.04 LTS Beta now. You are going to have better (and stable) support for btrfs with this release and will be supported for 5 years.\n\nA: Kernel 4.2 is available for Ubuntu 14.04 and it is default in 14.04.4.\nIt can be installed by \nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-wily\n\nKernel 4.4 is also available in Ubuntu repositories, but there may be issues with building proprietary kernel modules, like video drivers because of an old version of gcc in trusty.\nThis should not be an issue for a NAS\nKernel 4.4 can be installed by\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-xenial\n\nAnd yes I am using btrfs as a filesystem on 14.04 with kernels 4.2 and 4.4\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software Updater selecting problem It pops up as usual, yet there are some updates that are unselected and i can't select them. I deselect all, and select all, yet again they are still unselected. I did \n sudo apt-get update\n\nand after a time it popped and yet again they are still there. How can I fix this? Is it just related with my ubuntu or general issue?\n\nA: sudo apt-get update only searches your current repositories for any new/updated packages. If you actually want to update the packages, you need to run sudo apt-get upgrade.\nYou didn't provide many details, but I'm going to assume those packages that aren't getting selected have linux-image-generic in their names. If you want to upgrade those, the sudo apt-get dist-upgrade command is what you need to run (after sudo apt-get update of course).\nFor more information on what the difference between upgrade and dist-upgrade is, I recommend taking a look at this answer.\n\nA: You can try to update from the command line. Open terminal and type the following in order:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y\n\nThis should fully update all packages on your system.\n", "Q: Reinstalling Broken PostgreSQL 9.1 on Ubuntu 14.04 After upgrading Ubuntu from Precise to Trusty, I was attempting to upgrade PostgreSQL from 9.1 to 9.3 and have hit a bit of a snag. When I ran pg_upgrade in \"check\" mode, it complained about being unable to load the library pljava even after I had dropped the language.\nAfter much head-scratching, I had the brilliant idea to try a clean reinstall of PostgreSQL 9.1 and so blithely uninstalled the package, only to discover that I cannot now install it again, as Synaptic reports the package as being broken. Thus, I now have the 9.3 binaries and a set of data files created with 9.1 and no idea how to safely access them.\nCould someone please tell me EITHER\n\n\n*\n\n*how to reinstall PostgreSQL 9.1 so I may complete the migration process, or\n\n*how to complete the migration process safely without reinstalling the old binaries?\n\n\nA: The root of the problem appears to be that I was trying to use Synaptic Package Manager to do the install. Running the following commands:\nsudo apt purge postgresql-9.1\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1\nsudo pg_createcluster -d /path/to/existing/data 9.1 main\n\ncleared up the installation problem.\n", "Q: I need the best film production video editor I recently installed my ubuntu and am new to it.\nI have some projects with me related to video editing and since you can see, I have switched from windows to linux. I wanna know the best video editor for Ubuntu/Linux\nthanks in advance for your suggestions.\n\nA: I've been using Kdenlive for a couple of years now and really like it! I only ever had one issue with it. And it's great because you can proxy the clips which help a lot while editing on an older machine. These are examples https://www.youtube.com/user/garykennedy message through there if you need any help.\n\nA: I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenShot: a light, easy, full-featured video editor for Linux. You can use it to make some simpler projects.\n\n\nPros: extremely easy to use, intuitive, user-friendly, stable.\nCons: lacks a few advanced options for professional edition, such as audio waves. Its keyframe system is pretty poor.\nInstallation: in a terminal, run sudo apt-get install openshot frei0r-plugins.\n\n\n*\n\n*KDEnLive: an advanced video editor for Linux. It has an interface very similar to Openshot and is very good at professional video edition.\n\n\nPros: very modular (you can install plug-ins, edit your entire interface, etc.), stable, user-friendly, gets frequent updates (unlike Openshot), excellent for simple AND advanced tasks.\nCons: it's not as easy as Openshot, rendering times are long even with low settings (unlike Openshot), requires better hardware (crashes frequently if you have low RAM).\nInstallation: in a terminal, run sudo apt-get install kdenlive kde-runtime frei0r-plugins.\nI personally use Kdenlive because it suits all my needs, but used Openshot for a long time. If you need video compositing, you can also take a look at Natron and Lightworks.\n", "Q: How can I dual boot Ubunutu alongside a corrupted Windows 7 So here's the situation. While running CCleaner, something in my Windows files got deleted. After rebooting my PC, I got some bad news.\nSo, I ran the system repair to no avail. I had no applicable restore points, nor do I have my Windows 7 disc (my PC came preloaded). So, thankfully I remembered that I had Ubuntu on my flashdrive.\nSo, here's the situation now. I'm currently running Ubuntu on my flashdrive, however, I won't be getting a new PC for a few months (and I'm not going to repurchase Windows 7 in the mean time, since that'd be a waste), so I want to install Ubuntu so I can access my files and continue using my computer on Ubuntu in the mean time. I can't get into Windows, so I can't safely shrink my partition. I also don't have an external harddrive, so I can't really backup my files and risk doing it via Ubuntu.\nSo, what I want to do is install Ubuntu without affecting any of my Windows files, as I'd like to access them and eventually transfer them to my new builds. What are my current options, if any?\nI'd appreciate any help.\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I have another PC running Windows 7, so if I can somehow use that to fix my error, that'd be possible.\n\nA: One of the Ubuntu install features is to dual boot.  If you already have a partition you can use the option of something else\nYou would also have the option (which you are probably already using) to Try Ubuntu.  With this option you can use the gui partition manager, gparted to allocate space by resizing your partition.\nFrom the live boot disk (again, what you appear to be using) you can back up your windows Files.  You can actually purchase a 60 or 120 gig USB stick for under $50.00 for your backup media.  There are also many other backup media options, such as USB drives.\nOf course you already said you didn't want to change anything on your Windows, so that might be out of the question.\nResizing your partition and making space for a new Linux partition wouldn't change the data, it would just change the size of the windows partition.\nYou could also install a secondary drive and install Ubuntu on that drive.\nAs far as installing along size Windows, that's just as easy.  Run the install program and choose that option.  It'll give you a graphic slider and automatically make the partition size adjustment according to your specification.  It's relatively seamless.\nThe latter, by the way, also makes some changes to your computer.  If you don't have any other partition space available,  you will inadvertently be making the windows partition smaller.\nFinally, when installing Ubuntu you will be installing a different boot manager.  You can boot into Windows with the Linux (grub) boot manager.  But you can't boot into Linux with the Windows Boot manager.\nBy the way, you could consider a full install of Ubuntu on an external drive.\n", "Q: Cannot Install Libc-bin?
