["Q: Why is my launchd job running at boot even with RunAtLoad key set to false? I have a launchd plist file that I use to run a program at a selected time every day. It works, but it also runs the program whenever I boot the computer or unload and reload the job using the GUI program LaunchControl---even though I have the RunAtLoad key set to false?\nThe complete plist file is below; it is located in /Library/LaunchAgents/:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.adbot.plist</string>\n    <key>LowPriorityIO</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Users/wcm1/programming/ricedh/adbot/adbot.py</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/com.adbot.plist.err</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/com.adbot.plist.out</string>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>10</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>30</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThoughts?\n\nA: You likely have an interaction between the SuccessfulExit and RunAtLoad keys. The launchd plist manual page mentions an inversion takes place if RunAtLoad is set\n:\n\nSuccessfulExit \nIf true, the job will be restarted as long as the program exits and with an exit status of zero.\nIf false, the job will be restarted in the inverse condition.  This key implies that \"RunAtLoad\" is set to true, since the job needs to run at least once  before we can get an exit status.\n\nOthers have struggled with this behaviour, see launchd ignores RunAtLoad=false.\n", "Q: How to Convince IT to Let me Use MacBook at Work My company (about 130 people) is almost exclusively a Windows shop.  There is a small number of designers who use Macs due to business need.  I asked my boss and the IT guy if I could use my MacBook instead of the Windows 7 laptop they gave me.  \nThey're considering the request, but the vibe I got is that there has to be a really compelling reason to allow it (and \"because I like Macs better\" isn't good enough).   They cited \"infrastructure concerns\" and \"business needs\" as reasons why most people are on Windows.  \nI counter-cited efficiency, productivity, and a more secure OS.  I hate having to work on Windows - keyboard shortcuts are different, the mouse wheel scrolls the opposite way, and it just doesn't \"feel\" as solid as Mac OS.  \nHas anyone else run into this situation and managed to convince the \"powers that be\" to let them use a MacBook at work?\n\nA: They likely have little to no control over the designer's Macs, not because it isn't available but because they aren't knowledgable and don't need to worry about it for only a couple of people who require Macs out of necessity. This presents the concern for them that they wouldn't be able to properly manage and/or assist you. Whether or not the OS is more secure is irrelevant to them, they are already tasked with securing the Win 7 environment so the Mac would only present (potentially) more work for them as they would need to add management options for it or deal with it on a per help ticket basis.\nYour best bet?\nGet a couple of higher up executives/directors to ask for Macs as well. A higher percentage of people, especially when it includes those with influence, asking for Macs is much more likely to open the door than just one or two people.\nMy organization (roughly 500~ people, now about 200~ Macs) had this same situation, and what I just described is exactly what opened the door (which opened a flood of requests) for Macs.  Initially only the creative departments (working with video, publication, graphic design) had Macs, maybe 10-15 in the organization which used to be quite a bit larger.  4-5 years ago several of the directors and executives enjoyed the experience they had with their iPhones & iPads so much that they started to push for Macs as their work computers.  Not long after MacBooks, MacBook Pros and iMacs were added as options for people to order when they were hired or due for a computer replacement.  Jump to now and Macs make up 35-40% of the organization.\nThe flip side, reason I have a job, IT was met with a new technology that they didn't know how to handle.  Macs were hogging bandwidth with software update downloads, Active Directory integration only allowed for some management, new Macs required a lot of effort to configure for use, no one was experienced enough to troubleshoot them properly, etc.  This made it a necessity to hire a Mac admin, which led them to me.  From what I understand desktop support has been much less stressed since I joined, which I can believe from the work I've had to do to \"tame\" the Macs.\nMaybe not the answer you're looking for but I know of several other businesses that have had Macs approved in similar ways.  Hopefully the contrast of what it likely means for your IT team will help as well.\n", "Q: Why is my Airplay lagging? When I use my airport express to play music, the media is still 3 or 4 seconds late but if I change the volume the result is instantly applied.\nMy Airport is connected throw WiFi to my router and so is my MBP.\nAm I the only one facing this? Or is this a common issue? If so, how to explain that the volume settings are instantly applied whereas the music is always late?\n\nA: This is a \"feature\" of AirPlay. There is a 2-3 second buffer that makes sure the audio playback is smooth. This only applies to starting/pausing playback, because the volume adjustment is done on the source device, before the audio is even sent to the AirPlay speaker. You will experience this on all devices that support AirPlay.\n\nA: The volume is controlled by your device, and that's why it is instant.\nThe media you are playing is being transported over WiFi, and is therefore subject to a number of speed-influencing issues including:\nInternal/External Causes (Streaming from a home device such as a computer on the same network, some issues also cause problems to external sites and services like Netflix)\n\n\n*\n\n*Distance from Airport\n\n*Different vertical levels from Airport (eg. First to Third Floor). Wifi prefers to travel horizontally.\n\n*Interference on the channels caused by several devices using the same WiFi \"channel\"\n\n*Speed capability of Airport and Media Server\n\n*Hardware (sending and receiving devices experiencing hardware issues)\n\n*Software (sending and/or receiving devices experiencing software issues)\n\n\nExternal Causes (Internet)\n\n\n*\n\n*Internet outage or issues that are out of your control, and usually last 15 mins to several hours, but not a permanent problem.\n\n*Router is having connection issues with ISP (hardware failure, communication errors, etc.). This would be a more regular problem and requires a tech support call to your ISP.\n\n*Streaming service (eg. Netflix) is having issues (Generally, there will be some kind of website update if this is a widespread issue affecting all customers)\n\n\n\nYou should monitor whether you have this problem all of the time, or some of the time, and try to isolate the situations where it seems to be at it's worst. Keep in mind that streaming from the Internet is completely different than streaming from your internal Network.\n\nA: I live at an apartment complex with lots of other wifi networks. I used mac's 'airport' tool to find which wifi channels everybody was on (1 & 11), logged into my router, and switched the channel default from 11 to 4. Worked like a charm.\nThat was the last thing I did that really budged the needle. Before I did that I followed most of the standard suggestions, namely enabling home sharing on both my apple tv and my computer (via iTunes) so there was no possibility the video stream could be coming in over the internet rather than the WLAN which apparently is possible now with Yosemite, some people even say its default. The new upgrade to Yosemite screwed some things up in general though. We might have to blame Popcorn Time for that, I don't know.\nYosemite currently breaks some Development Tools stuff too, if you don't have Yosemite yet, future reader, don't upgrade at all unless you absolutely have to.\n", "Q: How to stop apps from opening automatically when I plug things in I do iOS development work, and I can't stand how iTunes and iPhoto automatically open when I plug in a device.\nI don't want anything to ever open automatically when I plug something in.\nHow do I make it so?\n\nA: In iPhoto > Preferences > General select \"Connecting Camera opens: no application\"\nIn iTunes select your device and go to Summary and make sure \"Automatically sync when this iPhone [or whatever device it is] is connected\" is unchecked.\nI'm not certain the second one will completely solve opening iTunes since I can't test it as I don't have a cable here with me. \n\nA: I can confirm that iTunes no longer opens upon iPhone connect when you un-check the \"Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected\" option under the \"Summary\" tab when in your iPhone settings in iTunes (see below) :)\n\n", "Q: USB Boot iMac 4,1 I have a Fat32 USB that I would like to boot on my iMac 4,1.\nThe Mac does not recognize the device from the boot menu (option key on boot) and I have tried the Plop disk but it freezes when it says loading boot sector.\nHow can I get this USB to boot?\n\nA: You need to use Disk Utility or a 3rd Party App designed to create Bootable Disks. If using Disk Utility, you need to follow some steps to create a Boot Disk, and use the proper format (which is not FAT32 for a Mac). You should be using the HFS+ format (Mac OS Extended Journaled), and there are some additional steps you need to take to make the disk \"bootable\".\nCult of Mac has an excellent article on this:\nhttp://www.cultofmac.com/180925/how-to-make-a-bootable-disk-or-usb-drive-of-os-x-mountain-lion/\nFAT32 is good for having a drive that can be read/written from a PC or Mac, but you cannot boot a Mac from that format.\n", "Q: Safari adds links on any page I had strange issue with Safari on Macbook today.  It add on any pages I had visited links to other sites.  It looks like an advertising.\nFor example, if I had the page with next text:\n\".... answers for you Apple question ...\" \nSafari changed page so \"Apple\" was hyperlink to other site with an advertising of Apple production.  I can see it on any page and with different words.\nI have not install any Safari extensions last time and the only thing that looks suspicious is the new Apple update which I have installed today.\nI have restarted Safari and now all looks fine, but I just want to know what it had been and what I can do now to find the reason this strange behavior and to dispose future risk to security.\n\nA: I think what Rob is getting at and what I think might be happening is that you have some malware (virus, etc) on your Mac (yes they do exist) that could be adding things to web pages.\nIt could be as simple as a browser extension or plug-in with some hijacking code in it, or something more system wide.\nyou could try resetting Safari (from the Safari menu select Reset Safari), turning off extensions (Safari menu -> preferences -> extensions. then turn them all off) or going into private browsing mode (Safari menu -> private Browsing). \nOptionally you could try another browser, Chrome or Firefox would be my choices. If they do the same thing then it may be system-wide and time for a virus checker or a visit with your favorite Mac repair shop (Apple store or local reseller) to determine what is going on.\nAlso some routers and some ISPs inject ads and other stuff into web pages. Try it on a different WiFi (Starbucks, etc...) and see if the issue goes away\n", "Q: How to turn off my speakers when no sound is being played? I just bought a wattmeter and realized that my speakers are using 15 Watts on idle.\nIs there a way to detect that no sound is being currently played in order to turn off my speakers ?\nThe system sounds are currently being played by my monitor through HDMI, and the audio output of my Macbook Pro is connected to my speakers through a jack cable. Applications that are likely to play sound are: VLC, iTunes, Chrome. \nI didn't want to formulate this question as a XY problem, so I'll just enumerate a few ideas that came to my mind to solve this. I'm open to any kind of solution, high or low level.\nTurning off the speakers will most likely be done with a relay controlled with an Arduino.\nI don't see any obvious way to detect if sound is being played programmatically, but I would be interested to know if this is possible. Maybe there is a system call that I could use to estimate the current audio level ?\nThe launching of the screen saver is more or less a good indication that it's time to turn off the speakers. It's probably possible to create a Quartz Composer composition that would be used as a screen saver, and also turn off the speakers when it's starting, but Quartz Composer seems to be dying slowly. Who knows if it will still exist in the next OS X release ? \nAlso, a totally external hardware solution would be great, maybe some kind of circuit that would detect if sound is currently being played, and activate or deactivate a relay accordingly.\nThe speakers are these ones:\nhttp://www.amazon.fr/CREATIVE-I-Trigue-L3450-Enceintes-2-1/dp/B0000CD7I8\nHere are the specs (in French):\nPuissance (Totale) Nominale de Sortie: 48 Watts\nPuissance Max de Sortie du Système Audio: 100 Watts\nDétails du système haut-parleur: 1 x Caisson de basses 30 Watts, 2 x Haut-parleurs satellite 9 Watts\n\nMy cheap Chinese wattmeter reads 11.8 W when idle; the same Chinese wattmeter gives me plausible measures with everything that I have measured so far (from a charging 12W iPad charger to a running 2300W boiler).\n\nA: You describe the problem as having 11.8 watt on the speakers while there is no sound coming from them. \nTry using Mute, to make sure no sound output is send to the speakers.\nYou also say you have 2 sound outputs one to the monitor via HDMI for the system sounds on external monitor the other to your external speakers true the headphone jack. \nThat is possible but requires special settings in the System Audio or 3D party audio application.\nIt is not possible to have 11.8 watt (as measured by your wattmeter) of audio power going to speakers without them making any noise, unless the speakers audio amplifier is junk. \nIt is possible that your speakers draw power because they have defective audio amplifier. I suggest looking in to it or returning the product.\n", "Q: Script / Automator for conversion of Apple Works docs to .odt docs With about 2500 AppleWorks docs, dating back to 1995, which I cannot open in the newly purchased Apple Pages ( but with LibreOffice), I need a script or some other automation to do it. (Most of the AW docs are textdocs, some are spreadsheets, those LibreOffice cannot open yet).\nSo I need some (shell?)

If you have any Virtual Machine software (like VMWare), grab yourself a copy of Snow Leopard Server. It has to be server to run in a VM, but given it's age, I think you may be able to find a copy for a bit less than the original $500/$1000 price tags.\nOnce you have a Snow Leopard machine running in your VM (which you can run on any modern Mac), now you can install the last version of AppleWorks on it! Snow Leopard can still run PPC apps through rosetta. \nThis doesn't fully solve your problem, you still need to make an applescript. But you can make a script that works on AppleWorks directly, \"saving-as\" all of your documents to the appropriate type. Maybe .rtf for text and .xls for spreadsheets.\n", "Q: How do I keep from activating facetime while on a call When making a call my cheek hits the screen and turns on facetime etc. \nHow do I stop this?\n\nA: Modern touchscreen phones have a proximity sensor, that emits IR light and measures the bounce back from nearby objects (if any). It's meant to detect your phone's proximity to your face. Perhaps you have a malfunctioning proximity sensor that's never detecting your face.\nDoes your screen go black when you cover the top (from the top of the display and up) with a finger?\n\nA: Actually once the phone is answered or ringing just hit the lock button on the top of the phone. It should still continue to operate as a phone but you have locked out the screen.\n", "Q: Remove Quicklook Syntax Highlighting with TextMate2?

While it is possible to create nice looking equations, it takes an enormous amount of clicking of the mouse. \n\"Back in the day\" (I got my first Mac, a 512k, in 1987), you could type cmd-option-backslash, and this would get you into \"inline equation editing\" mode.  You could then type your equation (with intuitive words for common symbols). Klutzy, but fast. Fast forward, it seems that Word on the PC still has such a feature, although the keyboard shortcut is Alt-=\nI am quite familiar with the equation typesetting available on some of the sites here on the stackexchange network, where typing something like $\\sum{\\frac{\\alpha_i x_i}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}}$ will produce a nice looking equation. For people who have good keyboard skills, this is vastly better than a graphical interface.\nSo here is my question: does this feature (still) exist in Word for the Mac? If it does, how do I access it? If it doesn't, is there an add-in that I could use instead? Or should I just abandon using Word and write in LaTeX... I have to admit that the more Word \"evolves\", the less I am able to use it. It makes me feel like a dinosaur.\nI did see this answer to an earlier question which goes some way to what I want - but I would very much prefer not to have to store my equations in one document, and copy/paste pictures into Word (and don't get me started on the non-intuitive way images, image placement, captions and word wrap are handled in Word...). Can't I just have it all?\n\nA: Word:Mac supports linear formatting and Math AutoCorrect.  If you go to Insert -> Equation, you can start typing the way that you expect to.  For a keyboard-only experience, you could create a custom shortcut to insert an equation.  \n", "Q: What is the length of a frame in Final Cut Pro in seconds? Possible to specify it? It took 23 frames and 0.92 seconds for the ball to travel from the first picture to the second so one frame is 0.04 seconds long, with 0.1 slowness (so the speed of the ball is roughly 150 km/h). How can I specify the length of the frame? Is it possible to specify arbitrary precise frame length in time?\n\n\n\nA: The length of a frame is proportional to the frames per second of your clip.  \nProfessional films, and HD television are typically set with a base frame rate of 23.98fps.  So 1 frame will be 1/23.98th of a second.\nFurther details on specifying and adjusting the base frame rate in Final Cut Pro can be read indepth here:  https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=D%26section=4%26tasks=true\n", "Q: Help Removing Last Traces of Genieo Some of that darned Genieo got on my computer.

It works pretty well at mirroring changes in .mp3 files names changes I do (i.e. My_Song.mp3 to MY_SONG.mp3), new files I add or files I delete. \nBut there are two things I can't sync right now. Playlists and files info attributes (i.e. when I switch the soundtrack Genre of one of my soundtrack it doesn't sync with the same soundtrack on my other mac). \nI know I can export+import playlist but I don't know how to actually sync using Google Drive. iTunes has a special way of \"storing\" playlists. What I want is, for example, I create/modify a playlist on my Mac1 and it sync to Mac2 via Google sync. I allready put all my mp3 files in my Google Drive. That doesn't help synching the two iTunes library. \nSo, how can I make my playlists + any changes I make on my soundtracks (not the mp3 files) sync between my Macs using Google Drive?\n\nA: I find Hazel to be a very useful app for this and many other tasks. It works similarly to Folder Actions, only it has more flexibility and actions, uses less resource, and it actually works. On Mac1, I assigned the Sync action to each of the iTunes folders I want to keep in sync. (I advise against syncing the Applications folder. It requires user interaction.) It only syncs one direction, so it won't start deleting or duplicating items on Mac1.\nOn Mac2, I assigned the Import into iTunes action to the parent iTunes folder, naming a generic playlist. It detects any new files added to any of the subfolders and adds them to the library.\nThe only thing is that it will also delete files if you delete them from Mac1, and it doesn't delete them from the library in Mac2. I have a scheduled job for Track Sift to run routinely, anyway, and it cleans up dead tracks, amongst other housekeeping chores.\n", "Q: RSYNC recursive over Time Machine Backups identify unique files i have an issue with my Time Machine Backup. To fix the mess i thought about waling recursively over all TimeMachine Backup folders.\nOldest Backup\nRSYNC to NEW_TARGET\n\nRecursively go over every Backup folder (Oldest Backup +x Days) and only copy files which don't exist on NEW_TARGET.\nBut there's a pitfall. The folder names got changed so:\n\"insurances\"\n\nin the Oldest Backup Folder might be renamed to\n\"insurences new\"\n\non a more recent backup folder but might contain a lot of same files AND NEW files. So i'm looking for a solution which could handle renamed folders in some way.\nI hope someone has a clue how to achieve a solution.\nChris\n\nA: Modifying Time Machine back-ups directly is difficult. Time Machine uses hard links and other tricks to work. So probably best to try and reconstruct the contents on a new drive.\nI would divide the problem into parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fix the folder names\n\n*Merge the folder contents\n\n\nRenaming\nYou can automate the renaming of files and folders matching specific patterns. See Rename multiple files by replacing a particular pattern in the filenames using a shell script for a collection of approaches.\nYou could also use AppleScript or Automator for this task, if you need more involved logic.\nMerging\nrsync is probably a good starting point for extracting the contents from the Time Machine drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*which is the rsync command to «smartly» merge two folders?\n\n*Synchronizing folders with rsync\nIf rsync does not quite provide enough for your needs, consider unison.\nunison is designed to keep folders synchronised, with the merging taking care to ensure the destination contains only the latest files. Unison can be used on local folders.\n\nA: For me:\nrsync -abviuPEh --stats\n\ndid the job.\na = archive\nb = backup (preexisting files will be appended by default with ~)\nv = verbose\ni = itemize (displays a summary what rsync did with a file)\nu = update (skip files that are newer on the dest)\nP = partial/progress\nE = extended attributes for HFS+ Mac OS X\nh = human readable output\n", "Q: How do I run this command in verbose output mode? I want to update my OS X Mavericks USB key and would like to be able to see what my mac is doing after I enter the following command.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app --nointeraction\nWhen I run the command as it is currently, only some information is output to the terminal, and while the install is copying over, the terminal does not display any info about what is going on.\nI know that --v usually displays each step in the terminal window as it takes place, but I tried adding that to the end of the above command and it did not work.\nI tried both with -verbose I get a not a valid mount point error.\nWhen I tried --verbose I got the following error\ncreateinstallmedia: unrecognized option `--verbose'\nUsage: createinstallmedia --volume <path to volume to convert> --applicationpath <path to Install OS X Mavericks.app> [--force]\n\nArguments  \n--volume, A path to a volume that can be unmounted and erased to create the install media.\n--applicationpath, A path to copy of the OS installer application to create the bootable media from.\n--nointeraction, Erase the disk pointed to by volume without prompting for confirmation.\n\nExample: `createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app\n\n\nA: You can use the verbose option only if the command itself provided it, which means that the programmer of the command you want to use has to check for the verbose option and set a flag its code so that the program outputs additional information. So if a command does not have a verbose option you cannot do anything about it. However it might output some information in system log files.\n", "Q: Suggestions for a Comprehensive Network Monitoring Solution We are looking for something that can provide a view (GUI or CLI) of all network traffic on our network.  We are running all Apple computers, with SonicWall routers.  Essentially, we'd like to have the ability to see what someone is looking at on the Internet when we notice that they are exceeding a regular traffic quota.\nI know we could use wireshark; but, I'm not sure if we can run that on the entire network and still be able to sift through all of the data that it would return, in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nA: Rubbernet\nYou can do this with Rubbernet. Install the daemon on all the Macs you want to monitor, then remotely monitor the apps (and the servers) that are using bandwidth.\n\nNote that this screenshot is from an older version of the software and doesn't show the reverse IP lookup — it is possible to show the domain rather than the IP.\n\n\n*\n\n*Real-time network dashboard\nRubbernet provides real-time monitoring so you can keep an eye on the exact state of your live network connections.\n\n\n*Remote monitoring\nMonitor all computers on your network from one Rubbernet instance on your Mac.

After that, they sit quietly in the background and provide the app with live data with minimal resource consumption.\n\n\nA: The above-suggested Rubbernet's domain name appears to be parked, and no product information available. Perhaps they've gone the way of Lithium (which went 'fut' a couple of years ago).\nWhile I do not have enough, recent, or long-term experience with InterMapper, I know they have been around for quite a long time, so you'd be less likely to run into issues like the above (putting resources and time into a product that disappears a few years down the road).\nThere are, of course, lots of open-source solutions, which require various levels of comfort and competency in setting them up. However, perhaps you might want to take a look at InterMapper?\n\nA: Another suggestion for OS X would be ntopng, which has a nice web GUI interface and will show you bandwidth utilization per node on your LAN.

And DivX discs to fit more of your videos on a disc.\n\nI use it all the time for burning mp4s to DVDs, the finished product will also work with DVD Players too.\n\nA: A lot of what you are trying to do depends on what you plan on doing with the resultant DVD. If you just want to play that file on a Mac than all you have to do is put it in a folder, right-click and select the option for burning the folder to disk (sorry, it's been a while since I did this and don't have a current Mac to reference at work for the exact procedure.)\nHowever if you then want to play the DVD in a DVD player hooked up to a TV you may have issues with that. Look at the manual for the DVD player (or find it online) and see what disk formats it supports. Some do support movie files of various types burned to a CD or DVD (note that DVD+R is a newer format designed to avoid licensing the original [now called DVD-R] format and not all players play both kinds of discs.)\nAlso burning a DVD+R in the Finder will give you a Mac formatted disc that will not play on a PC and MAY not play on a DVD or Blu-Ray player. Check the specs on the DVD player for that as well.\nIf I need to burn an actual DVD (like you get movies and TV shows on commercially) I use Toast which can transcode the MP4 file into a format any standard DVD player will understand. I haven't done that in a number of years as I just play those files using Plex on a Mac Mini plugged into my TV. \nToast is a commercial product that you'll have to purchase. There may be shareware/freeware programs that do this but I don't know what they are.\n\nA: Apple has removed iDVD from their suite. You will need to use a tool like iMovie (which is no longer free), or a 3rd party utility like burn\n\nA: There are a few articles listing 3rd-party options; the top free one seems to be Disco, which was originally a commercial app.\nmiDVD is available in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: While iDVD is no longer included in Mac OS releases or in the App Store, it is still available from the Apple Website.\n\nA: UFUSoft Blu-ray Creator for Mac is reputed to be the most professional Blu-ray burning software for Mac users. The best Mac Blu-ray burning software enables you to make DVD folder/DVD disc (DVD-5/DVD-9), Blu-ray folder /Blu-ray disc (BD-25/BD-50), as well as ISO Image File out of various videos in a super easy way. To get individualized DVD and Blu-ray disc, this program allows you to design menu with customized theme, background picture, background music, button, caption and more. On top of this, the internal impressive video editing features will make it a piece of cake for you to personalize videos via options like Trim, Crop, Rotate, Effect, and Watermark. Apart from this, the powerful 2D to 3D video conversion function will enable you to obtain vivid 3D DVD/Blu-ray disc on Mac with ease. \n", "Q: Some apps don't open even if deleted and reinstalled!

In my old GarageBand App under New Projects there was a \"Voice\" tab.  How do I locate that or is it no longer in the app?\n\nA: They have taken that option out of the new project area in the latest version. You can use \"Songwriter\" and delete the drums and guitars, or chose \"Empty Project\" and add a vocal track.\nIf you want to get the settings you've used before you can open an old project and use \"Save As...\" after deleting all the audio (not tracks) to get a blank project with the settings you like. \n", "Q: Homebrew: can't remove 'keg-only' OpenSSL application Given the recent OpenSSL scare I'm trying to clean out older versions from my machines but Homebrew won't let me:\n$ brew dirty\nopenssl (1.0.1e, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1g)\n$ brew cleanup openssl\nWarning: Skipping (old) keg-only: /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1e\nWarning: Skipping (old) keg-only: /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1f\n$ brew dirty\nopenssl (1.0.1e, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1g)\n\nHow can I purge these old versions of OpenSSL from my Mac?\n\nA: As of Homebrew f4d2141 there is a --force option.\nbrew cleanup --force openssl\n\nReferences: man brew\n", "Q: Trackpad on MBA keeps automatically clicking I always keep 'Tap to click' off because I like the physical feedback when clicking and I tend to automatically touch the trackpad.\nI reinstalled Mavericks last week, because I wanted to start completely fresh.\nNow my trackpad automatically 'clicks' often. Sometimes I just move the mouse, and it will drag things, making it super annoying to use the mouse.\nIs this a known problem, and is there a solution? I'm post-applecare so I hope I don't have to bring it in to get it repaired.\n\nA: This sounds like either a faulty trackpad or possibly a swollen battery.  I know the battery suggestion sounds strange but the reasoning is that as a battery swells it puts pressure on the components behind it, which for most of Apple's portables includes the trackpad.  Basically it could be slightly pushing on the back of the trackpad at all times, causing even minor touches to register as a click.\nThe only way to check for this is to remove the bottom case, which you may or may not be comfortable doing.  iFixit has a guide for replacing the battery that shows the steps to remove the bottom case and provides a reference for what a healthy battery should look like.  If the battery is not swollen then the other likely hardware fault is the trackpad, which isn't common but isn't all that uncommon either.\nBefore you tear into your Mac though you can at least rule out software as the culprit.  You can boot to your recovery partition by performing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power down your Mac normally ( > Shutdown)\n\n*Hold option while you power on your Mac\n\n*You should see a list of hard drives, one of which is likely 10.9 Recovery, select that and press return.  If you're instead presented with a password request you will first need to enter your firmware password before seeing the list of drives.\n\n\nOnce you're booted to the recovery partition you can test your trackpad but clicking/not clicking on items.  If the issue persists then it's likely one of the hardware faults I outlined above.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Do i need the 32 bit or 64 bit version of Mysql for use with php 5.5 First time Mac user, I am just about to download MySQL for Mac, which version do I need for use with PHP 5.5? Apologies if this is a really simple question.\nThanks\n\nA: If your Mac is 64 bit, the 64-bit version would be preferred. If you are on a 32-bit system, you'll have no choice but to go with the 32-bit version. See the How to tell if your Intel-based Mac has a 32-bit or 64-bit processor to determine what you are running.\n", "Q: How can I reset the service battery warning? I learned from one of my other questions that the \"Service Battery\" warning will limit your CPU power and slow your computer down - this is a problem I've been having with my MacBook Pro. \nI have 906 cycles on it but I'm still getting good life and unfortunately, I don't have time to go to get my battery replaced ATM since it's the middle of exam season for me. \nResetting the SMC gets me going for a while with full CPU speed, but then it slows down again.\nHow can I disable this warning and get my computer back for the next week?\n\nA: The bad news is you can not reset the cycle counter, it is a part of battery circuit. Your battery is at its end of life (EOL).\nTemperature\nHow to keep battery running just a bit longer, keep it cold.\nDo not have your laptop on your lap even if the name says so.\nGo to your fridge and get one of those jelly-packs and put it under the laptop.\nEnergy Saving\nQuit or disable any applications you are not actively using.\nDim the screen as much you can.\n\nA: I don't thin you can reset the warning, but just in case you missed it, check out my reply to your other post about the original problem you're trying to solve. \nConstant SMC resets required\n", "Q: Replaced hard drive - trying to do a clean install of OS-X on 2011 Macbook Pro I've seen plenty of how to's on how to upgrade if you have a working installation of OS-X, however I purchased this macbook used, it needed a hard drive and a keyboard.\nSo I put a new hard drive in it and installed Ubuntu temporarily.\nHow do I get the image of the newest OS-X onto a USB thumb drive? I can't access the mac store since I don't own any other Apple products.\nKeep in mind I'm using a regular, non-mac external keyboard until my new one shows up.\n\nA: Well if you have no other Mac, nor access to another Mac that you can download Mavericks with then you'll have to use internet recovery.\nBoot the Mac holding down COMMAND-R (on a PC keyboard that would be WINDOWS-R) And if there is no recovery partition you go into internet recovery and get the OS your Mac shipped with (Possibly Mountain Lion).\nProbably best to use a wired connection otherwise it will take hours.\nI gather it's not difficult to do, but Apple has a knowledge base article here with the details.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nOnce you get Mountain Lion installed you can use the App Store to download Mavericks. \nAnd if you just have to start with Mavericks, you'll have to find a friend with a Mac that can download that installer for you...\n\nA: The official answer from Steve Chambers will work in almost all cases. It's been a year, so the details aren't fresh in my mind.\nBut for some reason still, I could not access recovery mode! What I ended up doing was installing an older version of Mac OS X by DVD (Snow Leopard is what I used). \nThe install would fail, but it would set up a recovery partition. The recovery partition gave me access to the internet recovery option, which I in turn used to install the original operating system!\nGetting the Snow Leopard DVD ISO isn't too difficult. \n", "Q: Copying and pasting text between applications without style When pasting text, some applications (Chrome, Microsoft Office, etc.) will do what they can to re-render copied text with style, and some of those applications do not appear to offer an option to paste without style.\nThis results in spending lots of time removing formatting (where it is even possible) and then cleaning up the mess left behind, just to get clean text.\nI want to prevent text styling from attaching itself to text that I copy and paste between applications. Is there an OS-level way to do this, i.e. one that can apply to all applications? Failing that, is there a per-application way to tell Chrome, Safari, Word etc. not to copy and/or paste with style?\n\nA: O/S X does have a \"universal\" key combination to paste without any style, it's SHIFT-COMMAND-OPTION-V\nUnfortunately Microsoft uses their own text engine rather than the Mac's built-in one so that does not work there. The only options I have found for word is to create a Macro to paste plain text. You could download one of this but the one's I found were for the PC version and I never got them to work in the Mac version.\nBut I just find it easier to paste it into a plain text editor (I use Bbedit or TextWrangler, the free version.) Then copy and paste that into my word document. Annoying but it works for me.\nI believe there are a number of clipboard utilities that will do what you ask. A quick visit to macupdate.com should help with that.\n\nA: You can use the edit option Paste and Match Style which actually works by inserting copied text as plain text. By doing so, you can just copy and paste without the notes detour in your work-around. The default shortcut is ⌥⇧⌘V (ALT/SHIFT/CMD-V) but see below how to configure a simpler one.\nSome applications provide the same functionality, but name it differently in their edit menu. For these, you can add an entry to App Shortcuts with those applications' different Menu Title but with the same shortcut.\nTo do so\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*click the plus button to add a new shortcut\n\n*select All Applications\n\n*enter the app's Menu Title for pasting unformatted text \n\n*enter the Keyboard Shortcut by pressing the keys (at the same time)\n\n\nThe default shortcut ⌥⇧⌘V requires quite some finger artistic skills. To set up a simpler shortcut, just follow the above steps but enter a different key combination. For example, I use ⌥⌘V (ALT/CMD-V) which is similar to the original shortcut, but much easier to handle.\n\nA: Alternately, AppleScript can type the clipboard for you. \ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke (the clipboard)\n\nSave that and bind it to a keyboard shortcut, using something like FastScripts or Alfred, and you have a nifty way to paste plain text. As an added bonus, it works in this pesky forms that refuse to let you paste.\nAs an example for Alfred, \non alfred_script(q)\n   try\n      the clipboard as text\n      display notification \"Success! The clipboard has been typed.\"\n   on error\n      display notification \"Error typing the clipboard.\"\n   end try\n\n   tell application \"System Events\"\n      keystroke (the clipboard as text)\n   end tell\nend alfred_script\n\nIt'll even show a notification when it's done!\n\nA: I use Keyboard Maestro to manage my function key.  I write the applescript below which I bind to function key F3.\non run\n    try\n        set fromUnix to do shell script \"pbpaste -Prefer ascii | pbcopy \"\n    on error errMsg\n        log \" error...\" & errMsg\n    end try\n\nend run\n\n\n", "Q: Circuit simulator tool for OS X?

After you create the account, login using that account and try to restore your iPod.   This should eliminate any corruption issues in regard to iTunes, the IPSW file and your primary account.\n\n*Make sure you have totally disabled your Windows firewall.

I, however, didn't stop the installation process.  Instead, I continued with the option of later recovering/restoring the files from the Time Machine, believing that all data on my hard disk would be wiped out.\nMac OS X Mavericks was successfully installed, and all files/programs seems to be intact.  What did I do right?  In the case where there was a disk corruption, how could I determine,\n1) which files were corrupted?\n2) whether or not a log file was generated outlining the corrupt sectors/allocation units?\nAlso, how would I go about using Time Machine to restore the corrupt files (if any), as I have not done this before?\nAny advice/suggestions would be appreciated.\nEdit:\nI suppose my question is whether or not the installation process did, indeed, fix the corruption.  If so, where would I find the 'lost+found' folder (that is, if one exists)?\n\nA: Sounds like you are good to go.\nDuring the install it run in to a problem of incompatible software, but once that was out of the way the installer finished the job.\nIf you want to verify your install, run cmd-r and the restore (online) function. That might take a while so it is your choice to do or not.\nThe second question:\nEnable the Debug in Disk Utility, that will allow you to see the hidden partitions. It is very well hidden, because Apple does not trust us been able to handle our property.\nEnter the following command at the Terminal prompt:\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\n\n\nA: If you are feeling adventuresome, you could try forcing a re-write of the GPT.  I remember way back when it was de rigeur for solving a disk problem.\nYou need to enter Disk Utility and go to the Partition tab. Reduce the size of the disk a little. Click on \"Apply\" and let it finish.  Then you can expand it again to the original size and \"apply\" again.  This only serves to make it do the re-write.\n\nNo guarantee this will solve anything!\n", "Q: Is there a way to cycle between full screen windows on OS X? I have multiple Safari windows in fullscreen mode and I'd like to cycle through them using the keyboard (pretty much like command + ` works when windows are not fullscreen'd). I know I can control + ->/<-, but that will make me pass through all my non Safari windows. Is that even possible?\n\nA: The short answer is no. OS X, by default, does not have a method which allows you to contextually change between spaces, staying in the current application.\nFrom my experience, your best bet is likely to focus on tabs for your navigation, replacing (or augmenting) spaces. Safari tabs can be switched between with the keyboard using Command+Shift+{ and Command+Shift+}, which would give you functionally the ability to quickly switch between pages, while still not worrying about other applications getting in the way.\n\nA: I just tried having multiple Safari tabs open at once and was able to do the 3-finger swipe to switch between each space, which got me to the tabs.\n\nA: I've tried something like that but it seems that fullscreen apps turn into new desktops.\nWhen you open exposé(F3) with fullscreen apps running you can see the \"new\" desktops for each app.\n\nA: I don't have a Mavericks machine to test with but older Mac OSes use CMD+` to cycle through an application's windows.

So i have been given a macbook by my employer which was used by previous developer for iOS development. Now Appstore is asking me to update XCode to new version and when I am trying to update , it keeps asking me to login using Apple ID. In pop up window, it keeps showing me old user's apple id and doesn't let me change also. It is frustrating that Apple doesn't allow a different user to update the software unless that user has installed it. Any solution for this problem? \nI came across https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10395077/updating-xcode-using-different-apple-account this. The solution here says to delete the XCode from launchpad and then reinstall it. My question is if I delete XCode , will it affect existing iOS project files which were created using XCode?\n\nA: Delete the app from /Applications and then re-download it from your preferred Apple ID. Launchpad deletion is a bit cleaner, but does the same thing, preserving user files created by Xcode, but deleting the application itself.\nUnless you stored project files in /Applications, you won't affect project files or user settings since they get stored by default in /Users\n\nA: To make the AppStore forget the old credentials with which the app was downloaded, you must remove the _MASReceipt directory in the XCode app package itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and navigate to Applications\n\n*Ctrl+Click XCode and choose \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Expand the Contents directory and click _MASReceipt to select it\n\n*Press Cmd+Delete to delete the directory permanently—you will be prompted for your credentials since this is a protected file.\n\n*Quit and restart AppStore.\n\n\nFrom https://stackoverflow.com/a/13613340/81234.\n", "Q: Set Safari 7 dv tools console to clear on reload?

I know Activity Monitor exists to view disk i/o and other performance metrics. However, does Activity Monitor have the ability to log any of these metrics?\nIf not, how can I log these metrics into a database or csv file and how often should these be logged? Every second?\nI'm looking to run reports to see at what times of the day the server has a lot of disk i/o for capacity management. Also want the ability to log used and free space every 15 minutes.\n\nA: You can use traditional unix tools to start monitoring now.\niostat 60 | tee /tmp/iostat_60.log\n\nThe free space statistics can be generated with the df command, but you might just set your warning levels on server app and rely on alerts to notify you when space fills. I can't imagine needing to track storage space more than once a day to graph the growth or manage things, but your needs might be quite different.\nI'd say 15 minute (900 seconds for iostat) snaps of io activity would be sufficient and hourly or daily disk space logs would be overkill for most servers. You would probably decrease the monitoring interval during an investigation / performance tuning period, but day in and day out these\nstats usually just chew up CPU and disk space and don't really help you manage the server.\nOnce you decide upon how often you want to capture the data, you can get more fancy with a wrapper to start and stop the script / cut and process the log files daily, etc...\nI would say you're going to want to instead look at the tools you want for actually analyzing and acting on the data. For one server, you could probably get away with one free instance of splunk running and just log the data to syslog. \nFrom there you can graph / extract to spreadsheet / act on the data in a very flexible manner. Also, you might look at elasticsearch, logstash and kibana.\nThere is an excellent write up at http://krypted.com/windows-server/stashbox-turning-a-mac-mini-into-a-logstash-server/ by Charles Edge explaining the how and why you would use those tools to tame the logs and graph things. If you had that, sending the statistics to the system log might be a very easy way to solve your problem of monitoring IO on your server.\n", "Q: Unable to toggle Time Machine on Have been backing up an iMac to Time Machine on an USB drive for some time.\nI now find that in the System Preference for Time Machine the toggle for OFF/ON is grayed out and cannot be shifted to the ON position.\nSelecting \"back up now\" from the menu still works fine.\nThe user is an admin, running 10.9.2.

Unplugging the drives and plugging them back in will mount them. I'd like everything to mount and Dropbox to start up automatically for this user, which worked on the old Mac mini she was using. Now she has to go through multiple steps every time she restarts, which is not ideal.\nAny ideas what might be causing this behavior?\n\nA: Open a terminal window and enter the following command:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/autodiskmount AutomountDisksWithoutUserLogin -bool YES\n\nThat will prevent macOS X Lion, Mavericks and Yosemite from un-mounting drives at logout. Maybe that's the problem you're seeing as well.\n\nA: It recently happened to me that my 1TB Seagate drive doesn't show up in diskutil in a iMac and in my Macbook Pro as it used to be.\nI noticed that sometimes it doesn't show up on windows notebooks due to inadequate current supply in USB ports. \nSo my solution is just to replace the USB wire with another one (one comes with a LaCie disk), and every thing got fine.\n", "Q: How to disable Full Screen Animation on OS X 10.9 When an OSX window is promoted to be full screen there is a one second transition animation. How can this be disabled system wide? We would like the transition from small window to full screen to be instantaneous - except for the unavoidable lag from rendering.\n\nHere are two for examples of solutions that DONT work, so no need to repeat them:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1691359\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1plzmq/is_there_a_way_to_speed_up_or_skip_fullscreen/\nMost popular \"solutions\" are two:\n\nTerminal\nType \" defaults write NSGlobalDomain\n  NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool NO\"\nHit enter\nClose all applications before you do this to make sure the\n  setting propagates.

Nothing will change however you like to set it.\n\nThere is a app called TotalSpace (or Spaces) that I know is able to disable some transitional animations.\nURL: http://totalspaces.binaryage.com\n\nIn reality, Total Space can disable some animation switching between screens, but when you play a video on, say Yahoo Screen, the animation from a small video to a full screen video still remains - and in fact that is the actually annoying animation (takes about 0.5 second to complete therefore breaks the video experience).\n\nA: What I do for this is:\nEdit the Info.plist file for each application I want to run in full screen mode and add this key:\n    <key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>\n    <integer>4</integer>\n\nThe Info.plist of the application is located at /Applications/APPLICATION_NAME.app/Contents/Info.plist. For example for Chrome: /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/Info.plist\nIf you just open this file and you have Xcode will open with the Xcode editor. I prefer to edit with a plain text editor like sublime or text mate, it's just a simple XML file.\nSome applications when you edit this file will fail in the checksum and will ask infinite times to allow access to the osx keychain. Chrome or HipChat for example will have this issue when you edit the Info.plist. To solve this issue just open your Keychain Access and search the application with this issue and edit. right or double click on the application, click on the Access Control tab and then check Allow all applications to access this item -> Save Changes and the just restart the application.

I have 10 - 15GB of music on my PC. But iTunes is broken, even Apple couldn't fix it. So I can't update my ipod. Is there / what's the best way to itunes on my mac, so I can update my ipod, but not store the music on the Mac Hard Drive?\n\nA: I use a USB 3.0 enclosure that has 4 disks in RAID 10 to store my very large iTunes Media library.\nHowever, any external drive will work. Simply point iTunes to use the external drive.\n\nA: Preferences->Advanced->iTunes Media Folder location and point it at the iTunes Media folder on your external HD (or on your USB stick or whatever).\nIf you've got an existing one on your PC, you can copy that to the external first and iTunes should scan it for music when you first point to it.\nBTW, I fought the \"Let iTunes keep my library organized\" options for years before deciding they were actually pretty cool. If you let it organize all your files for you, they're organized by metadata and this incentivizes you to keep your metadata groomed and correct rather than just relying on file names.\n", "Q: How to switch to windows that dont belong to any running application? So, I installed an application that runs in the menu bar in OS X Mavericks. When I open that application's window (from the menu bar), there seems to be no obvious or intuitive way to switch back to that window with the keyboard after I've moved focus away from it.\nWhen I try Cmd + Tab, I see the list of running apps (Finder, Chrome). I thought that this window was possibly associated with Finder. However, when I switch to Finder (using Cmd + Tab) and then try to use Cmd + Backtick, the window never receives focus.\nI don't think it matters what the application is; I'm betting that this problem would occur with any app that runs in the menu bar and opens a new window. I will confirm this as I continue to install apps. However if you think it matters, the app in this case is called \"Spectacle\" from spectacleapp.com.\nUPDATE:\nThe same exact issue happens when you open a window like \"App Store Help\" from the AppStore. The OS basically leaves a window that is orphaned from the Cmd + Tab list or any other keyboard centric way of setting focus.\n\nA: Have you tried F3 or F9?  One of those should get you in to Mission Control which will show you all your open windows grouped by application.  This works for me with the window for Net Monitor.\nIf neither of them works, go in to System Preferences -> Mission Control to set up a key or hot corner.  \n\nA: Those windows do usually belong to some application, but the application is a UI element application that has no menu bar and is hidden from the Dock and the application switcher.\nIf you know what application a window is from, you can open the application with for example Spotlight or Alfred.\nYou can also select some of those windows with control-F4, which cycles through windows in the current space.\n", "Q: Custom Caching Limits for OS X Server In Server Manager, you can set predefined limits for the caching server.

Quick problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*My wife takes videos with her iPhone 5S (with iOS 7.1)\n\n*She downloads the videos from her camera roll to iPhoto and removes from the phone\n\n*She tries to sync the videos back to the phone through iTunes on her Mac (iTunes 11.1.5, Mac OS 10.9.2) but they won't sync\n\n\nYes, \"Include videos\" is checked and the specific album that has the videos in it has 47 videos on the Mac and shows 47 in iTunes but when they are synced to the phone, we see 27.\nThis happens with brand new videos taken with the iPhone, synced to iPhoto, deleted, and then synced back - they don't make it to the phone. I perform these exact same steps on my phone (same phone, same version of iOS, same iTunes, iPhoto, Mac OS) and the video syncs to my phone.\nI've gone back and forth trying to fix this problem and it seemed like I fixed it after messing around with the sync settings for a long time but we had to restore the phone because her work wiped it when she left and I'm not able to replicate what I did this time..\nAt this point, I'd really like to just reset the connection between iTunes and the phone and try to sync again like it's a brand new phone. Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: I have had similar problems with music and photos. Often, if you look at the files on the iPhone list via iTunes, they will be listed, but grayed out with a 'sync next time' icon next to them.\nSomehow, these get in a halfway state, where the iPhone thinks they are queued for sync, but then they never do.\nThe only way I have found that resolves this issue is to first backup the phone on iTunes, then restore it, which wipes the phone, reinstalls iOS, then reloads your backup. When I do this, the sync list is cleared, and the files will sync as normal.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Enterprise App Installation on iOS that is too old We have an enterprise app for which we are ending support of iOS6. During a recent test, we created a build of the app, and set the following values in Info.plist\n<key>MinimumOSVersion</key>\n<string>7.0</string>\n\nThe app was built with the iOS 7.1 SDK. If it matters (and I'm not certain that it does), it is a Xamarin.iOS project.\nAs we were testing, we expected that when we attempted to install on iOS6 that the installation would be rejected early in the process, since we were installing on an unsupported version of iOS. We anticipated that the previously installed version of the app would continue to function as it had before, without all of the new features.\nInstead what happened was that the installation failure happened later in the installation than expected, and the old version of the app was unusable after the upgrade failed. \nTo double check a couple of things, I downloaded the IPA file, and unzipped it. Inside the bundled Info.plist, I see this:\nMinimumOSVersion = \"7.0\";\n\nwhich is a good sign. However I think that it also explains why the attempted installation broke the previously installed version.\nFor regular apps, i.e. apps from the iOS App Store, you aren't given the option of installing applications for which your installed iOS is too old, and the installed version of the app remains unchanged.\nIs there a way to do such a thing for Enterprise Apps without having to build everything out?

See this stackoverflow question and answers for a few links to some details.\nAccording to this article, one of the consequences of setting the deployment target is to add a MinimumOSVersion string to the Info.plist file, but perhaps there are others too (in the binary itself?).\nIf you haven't tried this already, try searching for details on \"deployment target\" rather than MinimumOSVersion.

Will my hardware be able to run 10.9 efficiently ?\n\nA: \nThe question is, will Mavericks operate faster than Mountain Lion on my MacBook ? Will my hardware be able to run 10.9 efficiently ?\n\nYes. Mavericks has the same system requirements as Mountain Lion, but offers huge gains in energy efficiency, memory management, graphics performance, etc. And it's free!\nIf you're already in the process of moving over to Mountain Lion, I can't think of any reason not to jump directly to Mavericks instead.\n\nA: I am coming back to post my personal experiences, after having upgrade a bunch of macs (many 2008-2011 models) to mavericks and Yosemite. \nIt's true that both Mavericks and Yosemite are performing way better than the previous lions OS's.\nAlthough I have heard people complain that after upgrading their mac became slow, I believe that this is not because the OS is not working well, but mostly on factors like lack of adequate Ram, Hard Disk slow performance or very heavy system caused by too many applications, files etc.\nA few notes/tips:\n1. Clean Install against Upgrade over old system.\nIn all the upgrades I did, I got better results when I installed Yosemite or Mavericks as a clean install on the hard disk. Whenever I was just upgrading over the previous OS, the installation itself was taking longer time to complete. Also the computer wasn't performing that fast with the whole old system/configuration been upgraded.\nGenerally I saw a lot better results when I was formatting the hard disk, re-installing only the applications needed, and only restored personal files/settings of the user - not the complete user library.\n2. Ram\nAlso, in most cases 4GB of Ram seems to be sufficient, but wherever there is more, the computer can perform better with more apps/processes run at the same time. \nI have noticed also that many people ignore the fact that their computer has specific memory installed and that when the computer uses it at full, then every process becomes slower. I have connect with teamviewer to so many macs that their owners said that they are slow and I was always seeing that they had many open apps, browsers with too many tabs etc and just a few MB of available ram in their system. \nAlthough Yosemite and Mavericks are doing very good job in managing RAM and CPU, speed performance issues can still arise if what we are trying to do is more than what the computer is capable to offer. So using it wisely is important. \nThere are some apps in Appstore, that can automatically clear and free memory when there is none left available, so this may come in handy for many.\nSSD\nLast but not least, the BIGGEST PERFORMANCE GAME-CHANGER is to use a SSD drive. An SSD drive will boost your macs speed performance up to 10-15 times. \nI can say that my macbook pro, is running faster than ever before.\nMacBook Pro 15-inch, 2.53 GHz, Mid 2009.\nMemory: 8 GB \n500GB SSD\nYosemite\n", "Q: Terminal Command to Check Available USB Ports I recently took a trip and was utilizing a USB GPS Device push coordinates to a file.

Google tells me a plug-in called MailTabs was created for this back in 2011, but it's now defunct, and I can't seem to find any other options. Thanks!\n\nA: MailTabs previously would only install up to Lion.\nI just confirmed MailTabs can now install on Yosemite, since it seems to be detecting 10.10.1 as 10.1. Messages that are opened as separate windows will fill the window as if taking up a tab. The Shift-Command-LeftSquareBracket and Shift-Command-RightSquareBracket keys work in that you can navigate between the messages and the normal app view, but there are no actual tabs present. The messages do not stay open between closing the app and re-opening the app. The full-screen view is very broken, and it even got stuck for me, leaving me only with the option to Force-Quit.\nThis plugin would be extremely useful if it was revived, as it can give you the tab functionality available in Thunderbird.

All the information I can find says to connect the mac to the network through an ethernet cable first, but I don't have one handy. I need to be able to do this through wi-fi.\nIt's not critically important, but it is an interesting problem.\n\nA: Your Mac would need two WiFi interfaces to do that. You could add a USB plug-in one, or you could use an Airport Express as a WiFi extender with no connection needed to either computer. I see older AExes listed on Craigslist for $40 - $50.\n\nA: When sharing the Internet connection using the Sharing system preferences pane, it only allows you to share 'from' one interface 'to' another.\nAs a result of this, I think it is likely to be difficult to do what you are trying to do, if it is at all possible.\n\nA: I'd strongly recommend against trying this kind of identical network to network sharing. You are likely to lose more time troubleshooting than the cost of putting in simpler equipment to get this right in the first place.\nWhat work great here would be to take a basic router and using it as an access point sharing out the wifi internet connection over ethernet to both the Mac and the PC. A good router is likely to grab a cleaner signal than either of the computers. If your ethernet cables are even two or three meters, you'll have a lot better opportunity to tune the position for better reception.\nAs a specific example of how ethernet can help on a wireless connection, my Huawei B200 offers much better performance via ethernet than it does when sharing out is 3G connection via wifi (ping times are 15ms instead of 80ms, connections all start fast instead of fits and starts).\n\nBuilding as much of your networks as wired as possible will save you a tremendous amount of time and offer substantial performance wins.\n", "Q: Blocking websites on OS X I would like to block some websites on the guest account, so my cousin cannot browse things that are not safe for my computer.\n\nA: You can do this using Parental Controls on the Guest account.

That Macbook has a 32-bit processor (http://ark.intel.com/products/27237/Intel-Core-Duo-Processor-T2600-2M-Cache-2_16-GHz-667-MHz-FSB), so there's no way to have it use 64-bit software.\n\nA: \nCan I install 64 bit software on this mac?\n\nShort answer\nNo.\nLong Answer\nYour MacBook has a i386 CPU on it. The instruction set doesn't have any forward compatibility with the newer 64-bit architectures such as AMD64 or IA-64.\nThe reason AMD64 has backwards compatibility with x86 (not sure about i386), is that it was designed to be an extension to the x86 architectures while still allowing CPU instructions to grow as large as 64 bits in length, as opposed to x86, where instructions are just 32 bits in length.\nWhere as i386 was designed without ever having thought that, perhaps one day, instructions will be of 64 bits in length, and hence why 64-bit support was never built.\nYou might want to look into virtualizing a 64-bit OS. I'm not entirely sure if your MacBook supports it, but you might want to look into enabling VT-x to virtualize a 64-bit architecture.\n", "Q: iMac with 8GB RAM -- memory always almost full I have a 27'' iMac (Late 2012, OS X 10.9.2) with 8GB RAM. The usage of memory is always above 7GB, even though I don't think I am running that much stuff. This leads to the occasional hanging of a program and occasional feeling of the computer being lagged.\nThe heaviest thing I am running is a Parallels virtualization of a defunct Windows laptop (for my Windows-only programs; work-related). Then I mostly surf with Chrome (10-20 tabs, some with youtube videos). Of course I have other things opened, like Mail, Evernote and a few more. But I don't think a 8GB RAM computer should be overwhelmed by that. I could be wrong.\nI am willing to provide an export of processes from the Activity Monitor. I tried looking into it, of course, and I am running A LOT of small processes (unknown to me) -- system stuff I presume. I am a long-time PC user and I know my way around process management in PCs, but not on Mac.\nWhat do you think? Do I just need more RAM or it doesn't feel like it?\nRegards,\n\nA: Because OSX manages memory (as does Windows) it is often difficult to tell if performance issues are caused by memory limits. Technically, you really want the OS to capture all the available memory and allocate as needed, in which case, you would see all of the memory being 'used', even though there may be memory available but not allocated by the OS. \nThis is somewhat analogous to what is happening in OSX and Win7+. However, Apple has made it confusing in the past with many memory classifications, like Wired, Swap, Real, etc.\nLuckily, you are running Mavericks, and a new feature of Mavericks is the Memory Pressure graph, described in the Apple support document here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5890\n \nBasically, if the memory graph shows Red, you need more RAM, if its Green, you are good. I suggest reading the article for more details, but the Red, Yellow, Green is a great visual tool to help guide where you might be seeing problems.\nDepending on your model, I have personally found Macs suffer more from hard drive access speed than memory limits, so an SSD, if your iMac does not have one, has a huge impact (and unfortunately quite a bit of work to put into your iMac)\n\nA: As any modern operating system, OS X tries to make use of RAM as much as possible. For example, OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*keeps data in memory when an application quits to gain time if it’s launched again;\n\n*caches recently used files from your (slow, slow) hard drive for faster later access.\n\n\nObviously, this memory is still available for other uses if need be. But the system rightfully see no need to “free” it right now: it waits for the need to appear.\nThis means that, after running for a while, your computer will always indicate that your memory is completely used or almost. It doesn’t mean you don’t have enough RAM, just that the system doesn’t let it go to waste.\nTo know if you’re actually lacking in memory, you should mainly check if you’re swapping often. I would refer to @cmason’s excellent answer.\n\nA: Get yourself an SSD. 10.9.2 knows quite well how to efficiently manage your RAM and you should not worry about it. As it is said above OSX will try and keep as much memory used as possible, for healthy reasons.\n8GB is right for normal usage (heavy video/graphic editing not considered normal in this context).\nI have an early 2011 15\" MBP w/8GB that just became a different, way faster, machine when I installed an SSD. I run Win7 virtual machines off VirtualBox, with the virtual machines on an external FireWire 800 drive, no problem.\n\nA: I like @cmason's answer, but I'd like to clarify a few foundational things.\nYou have two separate questions here: (1) The lags you report is most likely hard disk-induced, as hinted by some answers. Going to the right place in a hard disk takes often on the order of ~10 ms, and these delays build up to be visible to a user. (2) Memory is full because the memory is used as cache of the disk.\nThe only relation is that when the system needs to read again the same stuff from disk, having more RAM used as cache could help (if what you need was kept in RAM).\nBut whenever the system reads new stuff from the hard disk, only a faster disk (an SSD) can help (alternatively, some systems try to guess what the system is going to read from the disk and read it in advance, but this cannot do miracles in general, since computers don't have crystal balls to predict the future).\n\nA: A RAM upgrade is cheap and easy so just do it rather than try to understand the complexities of memory management under OS X. \nAn SSD upgrade is expensive and hard (especially on an iMac) but will make a far more immediate and noticable difference. I’ve never tried it but I suspect that even running OS X off an external Thunderbolt-connected SSD would be faster than the internal spinning disk (although slower than an internal disk).\nMost likely, between Parallels and Chrome, OS X ends up swapping memory to disk and disk i/o on a rotating disk is sloooooow. My experience is that browsers are reluctant to release memory over time so try restarting Chrome when you notice the problem. Most likely that’s easier than restarting Parallels.\n\nA: 8 gigs of ram is fine for your mac brother...ive got a 2014 mbp w/8gs, and have the same issue. the memory looks like its always almost used up, but its actually just in the app and file cache...i personally like it to show all my mem and not be in the cache(s), but what can ya do? lol...\nand btw - ive got an ssd. ive also been nothing but a mac user my entire life, and i can honestly tell ya it makes a WORLD of difference....from a bootup time of about 1 min & a 1/2 usually, to a bootup time of about 5 seconds.....NO BS  ;)\n\nA: People recommending RAM upgrade - wasting your time and money. Monitored the issue for a while now on brand new 30\" desktop Mac, had 8Gb to start with. RAM use just climbs up and up over days and apps are not releasing any, after 3 days Firefox seats with 4GB RAM, other apps holding on to plenty leaving nothing to the system and it's absolutely crazy slow and unusable. \nUpgraded to add another 8GB to total of 16. And what do you know? 3 days later all 16GB exosted, Firefox at 5GB, Atom text editor at 4GB, other apps similar, mail holding onto 3GB. \nThis numbers are insane, they are not normal, this doesn't happen on real PC's ie Windows or Linux. This is entirely Apple OS fault and poor RAM management.\nSo don't buy more RAM, save the money. I am still looking for hopefully a programmatic solution to force it release the ram from the apps.\nUpdate: turns out curtain apps are smart enough to have their own RAM management, editing Firefox about:config:\nbrowser.cache.memory.enable - true\nbrowser.cache.memory.capacity - something sensible\nconfig.trim_on_minimize - true\nbrowser.sessionhistory.max_entries - 10\nnglayout.initialpaint.delay - 0\n\n", "Q: How can I let Windows XP read Mac OS Extended (Journaled) drives?

As long as you keep your account you should have access to the content, but I think you'll need to make a new account once you get a credit card in the new country. I don't know if you can have 2 accounts active in iTunes at the same time but I'm pretty sure you can switch between accounts. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro can't boot: shows Apple logo then grey screen There is a MacBook Pro from 2012 with Mountain Lion that won't boot.

The hardware was fine, so I continued to look for error messages.\nAfter booting in Verbose mode (Command (⌘) + V), I saw that securityd crashed, and that a crash log was written to /Library/Logs/CrashReporter/securityd_2015-06-23-120634_localhost.crash. So once again I rebooted to get a shell in Single user mode (Command (⌘) + S). The log showed that the crash was caused by a call to CFDictionaryContainsKey (which triggered an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error). This fed my suspicion that the crash was caused by a bad configuration file.\nI eventually came across this blog post, which suggests to use fs_usage to monitor and log the file activity:\nmount -uw /\nfs_usage > /var/log/fs-usage.log &\nexit\n\nAfter restarting, I looked in /var/log/fs-usage.log and found that securityd accessed private/etc/authorization before crashing. Then I viewed the content of /etc/authorization, and it was indeed broken beyond repair.\nTo recover this file, I searched for the original version of the file in the source of the securityd package (referenced at OS X 10.5.2's source code). I eventually found etc/authorization.plist, which had some similarities with the corrupted /etc/authorization.\nTo complete the recovery, I put the new etc/authorization.plist on a USB stick, plugged it into the Macbook (still in single user mode) and mounted the drive as follows:\nmount -uw /\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.kextd.plist\n# Wait about 20 seconds\n\nmkdir /Volumes/usb\nmount -t msdos -v -o ro /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/usb\n\nThen I copied the file to its destination, unmounted the USB stick, synced and rebooted successfully:\ncp /Volumes/usb/authorization.plist /etc/authorization\numount /Volumes/usb\nsync\nreboot\n\n\nA: I would recommend following Apple's guide regarding the gray screen at startup.\nHave you installed any new firmware/drivers or software that might be the issue? Worst-case scenario is a re-install I'm afraid.\n\nA: A verbose boot (Command-v) will tell you where the install is hanging.  It'll spew a lot of text, then hang (presumably) on some line.  That's where you can start to see what's going wrong.  Post that line here and there may be clues.\nYou can try a single user boot (command-s) as well, which skips the UI and drops you to a command line, but that can be harder in terms of diagnostics.  \n\nA: I had success with this method:\nBoot into single user mode by holding down commands as soon as you hear a boot chime. This works on Bluetooth keyboards too.\nIt should boot to a command line.\nOnce in single user mode do the following commands at the command line.\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nrm -f /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist\nrm -f /var/db/.AppleUpgrade\nreboot\n\nA: http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nApple has issued a Repair Extension Program for Video Issues.

These MacBook Pro systems were sold between February 2011 and December 2013.\nApple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will repair affected MacBook Pro systems, free of charge. See below for details on affected models and service options.\nSymptoms\nAn affected MacBook Pro may display one or more of the following symptoms:\nDistorted or scrambled video on the computer screen\nNo video on the computer screen (or external display) even though the computer is on\nComputer restarts unexpectedly\nProducts affected\n15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro models manufactured in 2011\n15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina models manufactured from Mid 2012 to Early 2013\n\nA: I had a very similar problem. I went through all the reboot procedures, but still nothing but gray screen. I finally took it to a local mac repair shop, and my FileVault is defective. They turned it off and all is well. They recommend that I leave it off otherwise the same thing can happen, and some cases it wipes out all your data...\n", "Q: Apple ID Password requirements As you know, the Apple ID Password must meet some minimum requirements, such as having at least one lower case letter, one capital letter, one number, etc.\nSo, how come sometimes I see a customer putting in a password just 4 characters long?\nI am thinking probably if it is a very old password, never changed before, it can be still used as a valid Apple ID Password? Or what?\n\nA: There are two types of passwords, the device passcode and the appleid password.\nThe device passcode gives you access to unlock the device, and it can be as short as a 4 digit PIN.\nThe AppleID password must be 9 (I think. It's either says \"8\" or \"more than 8\") or more characters long, contain at least one capital, one lowercase, and use at least one number or special character.\n\nA: It's most likely the case that they have a very old Apple ID and haven't changed their passwords since creating their account. I don't know if Apple had lower password requirements in the early days of iTunes/Apple ID, right now they require 8 character passwords as a minimum it seems.\n", "Q: Free firewall and network monitor Application like the LittleSnitch?

I never even get this on stand by. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/sp655\n\nA: I wouldn't necessarily take Apple's word on how much of use you can get out of your iPhone given it's mostly marketing and reproduced in specific lab conditions. Here are some real world numbers from AnandTech's iPhone 5 review. The differences can be quite significant for instance, 4.55 hours on 3G and 8.19 on LTE.  \nNote that this is presumably for a brand new iPhone 5; if you have one that is more than a year old, it would probably be around 80-90% of it's maximum battery capacity.\nLastly, here are some ideas on maximising your iPhone's battery life:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Location and Background App Refresh for Facebook\n\n*Disable Background App Refresh for Apps You Don't Care About\n\n*Stop Quitting Your Apps in Multitasking\n\n*Disable Push Email Temporarily (especially if you are using Exchange)\n\n*Disable Push Notifications for Apps That Annoy You\n\n\nIt may also be worth doing the test mentioned at the top of that blog post i.e. \n\nSo here's the test: write down your usage and standby time, press the\n  sleep/wake button (or lock button, as some call it) to put the device\n  to sleep, and set the device down for five minutes. When you come\n  back, take note of the change in time. If your device is sleeping\n  properly, then the Standby time should have increased by five minutes\n  and your Usage time by <1 minute . If your Usage time rises by more\n  than one minute, you have a drain problem. Something is keeping your\n  device from sleeping properly, significantly shortening the time it\n  will last.\n\nFrom my own experience, I've noticed that apps that utilise background app refresh in concert with location services tend to be pretty expensive in terms of battery usage. Dropbox and Downcast use these to upload photos and download podcasts in the background respectively - location services appear to be turned on all the time when these Dropbox/Downcast features are turned on. I turned off background app refresh and location services for both of these apps and have noticed quite significant improved battery life.\n", "Q: How to reset OS X volume after sleep using launchd? I'm been trying to write a plist file on which when I return from sleep mode, I always want to make my Mac volume to the minimum amount. However, it looks like the following plist doesn't work, with an error: 1:1: syntax error: Expected string but found end of script.

Only a set of quotes need removing.\nQuotes\nThe quotes are no longer needed in the second launchd job ticket, so change:\n<string>\"set volume output volume 0\"</string>\n\n…to…\n<string>set volume output volume 0</string>\n\nGrouping Arguments\nIn this case, the quotes grouped the set of arguments for osascript to see as one item. Thus osascript gets two arguments, the flag -e and the script. This meets the requirements from the osascript manual.\nWhen called through Terminal.app and thus through the shell, the quotes are needed to perform the grouping. When osascript gets the arguments, the shell has removed the quotes.\nWithout quotes, spaces subdivide each item passed via the shell.\nWhen called through a launchd job ticket, the grouping is intrinsic within the array passed as ProgramArguments. In your first ticket, the array contained nine items and in the second ticket, the array contained three.\nLaunchAgent\nBe sure to add this launchd job as a ~/Library/LaunchAgents as osascript requires an active user with a graphical session.\nThis approach approximates what I do with Power Manager in How to Set the Volume When Logging In.\n\nA: The second plist should work if you remove the extra quotes, but it only runs the command at login and not after waking up from sleep.\nYou can use sleepwatcher to run a command after waking up from sleep.

It appears to work like normal i.e. reading and writing (I've already copied all my data off it)\n\n*I can't seem to either eject the disk or unmount the partition that is mountable. If I hit the eject button in Finder, the partition name greys out and is not clickable but does not go away.\n\n\nVia Disk Utility, I am unable to either mount the Time Machine partition (I get the generic not able to mount partition error message) and I am also unable to run Repair disk on it (error message: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.). Screenshot below. I tried erasing the disk but that also did not work (error message: Couldn’t unmount disk.)\n\nIt sounds like my hard drive has failed (or is in the process of failing) - the only things that I makes me second guess myself and make me wonder if the disk is salvageable are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The non-Time Machine partition appears to mount correctly and can be used as usual (although as mentioned above it cannot be unmounted)\n\n*The drive is not that old all: probably about 18 months old. I have drives that are older that are still ticking along nicely.\n\n\nIs this a simple case of a failed drive (perhaps a defective product) or is this a symptom of a software related problem (e.g. there have been several instances where the drive has been unplugged without being ejected correctly)?\n\nA: I had the same problem and resolved it like this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplugged the drive\n\n*Turned off Time Machine in Pref\n\n*Rebooted the Mac\n\n*Plugged the drive back in\n\n*The Time Machine partition mounted\n\n\nA: I would guess it's most likely a logic corruption/error and not a physical corruption of the drive since the other partition seems unharmed. This has a chance of happening if you are writing/reading data and suddenly unplug your drive. Can't be 100% certain so if I were you I would definitely try to backup the other partition to another drive in case it fails as well.\n(If you could post a picture of how the drive appears in Disk Utility it would be great!)\nWD has a 3(?) year warranty (you can check the warranty status of your drive here) on HDD's that suddenly fail which would cover a manufacturing error.\nBefore going through the tedious RMA process I would try to:\n1) Unplug the drive\n2) Reboot the Mac (without the drive connected)\n3) Connect the drive\n4) Open Disk Utility again and try to repair/fix the partition\n5) Run sudo diskutil verifyVolume /dev/diskN (where N is the volume name not the disk name) to try and see if the file system structure can be read at all.  \n6) Depending on the outcome of the command (it should return something like \"the volume X appears to be ok\" if it's fine) I would try to repair it with sudo diskutil repairVolume /dev/diskN \n7) As a last resort, run sudo diskutil eraseDisk {Format} {NewName} /dev/diskN (replace {Format} and {NewName} with your preferred file system and new name for the drive) which will try to erase the disk and apply a new file system. This will remove your previous partitions and you will lose the data on the disk.\nIf I'm being stubborn I would try to find a good disk repair software and run that to diagnose the drive before doing the RMA-process.\n\nA: So the drive turned out to be alright but Disk Utility was not able to rectify (and exhibited the symptoms listed above). I managed to salvage the drive by erasing it using Disk Management on Windows (where both partitions showed up as 'Healthy') and reformatting it on the Mac. \n\nA: I rebooted the iMac and replugged the WD Time Machine 3 times --it would not mount and \"could not be found\".  Wondering if it simply might be the cable connection I twisted the cable so I could insert the plug into its reverse position.   It immediately mounted as it should as the lighting bolt plugs are reversible.  Perhaps it was just a bad connection on a pin in the plug.  Might need a new cable. \n\nA: I had the same problem with my year-old external drive (3 TB Macbook) – the Time Machine partition wouldn't mount, and the other partition was fine but wouldn't eject. \nEnded up reformatting the drive using a different computer (which read both partitions as \"healthy\"). Works fine now, though I wish I'd known and tried some of the sudo commands first! Wonder if this is something happening in Yosemite/El Capitan; never had this problem previously.\n\nA: The Time Machine partition was not being recognised but the non-time machine partition was being recognised. I couldn't repair or even erase/reformat the Time Machine partition through Disk Utility as it just didn't recognise it.\nI then split the non-time machine partition into 2 separate partitions with the intention of using one of them as a new Time Machine partition. However once the partition had been completed my mac then recognised the old Time Machine partition and everything worked as normal from then on - no idea why doing the additional partition solved it, but it did! \n\nA: just install the DiskDrill application then connect that HDD(which faces the problem) to your macbook and open DiskDrill application which is in your applications folder on your mac after opening it starts loading your drives then while loading external hdd in this application there is a possibility that this application can detect your problem and after correcting problem mount your disk on your macbook it seems like it unlocks something.\njust try this application rather than trying too much commands its 90 % guarrenty that you can resolve your problem using this application.\nif loading does not solve your problem then just go ahead and click on rebuild partition in this application.\nsteps :\n\n\n*\n\n*install DiskDrill application.\n\n*connect HDD(which facing problem) to your mac.\n\n*open DiskDrill application.\n\n*after opening this application it starts loading your drives.\n\n\nwhile loading there is possibility that this application can mount the unmounted drives.\nif not \nthen\n\n\n*wait for load and click on rebuild partition.\n\n", "Q: Thunderbird needs to login google every time (CalDAV) Befor: I use Thunderbird/Lightning for my mails and for my calendar.

Find the correct identifier for the ExFAT partition.\n\nNow run the following in the Terminal:\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume {FileSystem} {Name} /dev/diskN\n\nReplace {FileSystem} with HFS+ or similar (only natively supported on Mac, not Windows/Linux) and {Name} with a name for the partition. Replace /dev/diskN with the identifier for your ExFAT-partition. Make sure you type the right identifier, if you type in the wrong one you could easily wipe your Mac's internal harddrive.\nNow the partition should be reformatted, unless any errors occured. Now you can open up Disk Utility and choose to format the partition as NTFS if you don't want to stick with HFS+.\nThis might not be the most effective way to do it, I'm no expert so anyone with better knowledge feel free to come up with a more effective solution\n", "Q: Spam SMS on iPhone - any chance of stopping it?

Is there a way via an app on iPhone or Mac, to select and delete messages originating from a phone number that matches a pattern?\nSpecifically, I get many text messages every day from my ZWave deadbolt lock. The number the device uses starts with \"1-100\", but the remaining digits are always different (but sequential). This makes the messages not cluster together into a conversation which could be easily deleted.\nAlternatively, maybe there exists a way to group multiple senders based on a range of numbers, as I can't foresee the actual value of the numbers.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT:\nThis one-year-old thread asked a similar question about matching a pattern within a message from same sender. There were no answers, and I wanted to see if there had been any new developments in this direction?\n\nA: I haven't heard of an App that can delete text messages at all, but I can see it's usefulness in a situation like this.\nFurthermore, I don't think there exists a solution to group senders with (partially) unknown numbers, if you new the numbers an ugly and time consuming solution would be to add all possible numbers to one contact, then all messages should hopefully be kept in the same conversation.

I am trying to use /etc/paths.d to add an executable to my path variable but I have no success so far.\nThe full path of the executable file is: /opt/ImageMagick/bin/convert\n/etc/paths.d contains two files: 40-XQuartz and ImageMagick\nThe 40-XQuartz contains one line: /opt/X11/bin\nThe ImageMagick contains one line: /opt/ImageMagick/bin\nMy echo $PATH gives:\n/Users/Administrator/.rbenv/shims:/Users/Administrator/.rbenv/bin:/Users/Administrator/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin\nSo it seems that only the first file (40-XQuartz) does its job.\nThe permissions of the two files (40-XQuartz and ImageMagick) are exactly the same so my question is why the first one works and the second one is not.\nI am running OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: Running\necho /opt/ImageMagick/bin|sudo tee /etc/paths.d/ImageMagick;bash -l;echo $PATH\n\nadds /opt/ImageMagick/bin to PATH on my installation.\nAre you overriding PATH in some other place like ~/.bash_profile?\nThe paths in /etc/paths.d/ are added to the path by /usr/libexec/path_helper, which is run from /etc/profile, /etc/zsh.env, and /etc/csh.login. path_helper is not run by graphical applications or when bash is invoked as a non-login shell.\nYou can also set a default PATH in /etc/launchd.conf:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run for example setenv PATH /Users/Administrator/.rbenv/shims:/Users/Administrator/.rbenv/bin:/Users/Administrator/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/opt/ImageMagick/bin|sudo tee -a /etc/launchd.conf.\n\n*Either restart, or run launchctl</etc/launchd.conf;sudo launchctl</etc/launchd.conf and relaunch processes.\n\n\nI prefer changing the path in /etc/launchd.conf, because it also affects programs that are not started from shells, like text editors and programs started by launchd jobs.\n\nA: Have you started a new login shell since adding the new file for ImageMagick?

The issue occurs when I close all open tabs and Terminal windows with ⌘ + w, so that the app is still running but there are no windows visible.\nThe behaviour of Terminal on 10.7.5 is as I would expect. When I open a new window with ⌘+n the new terminal window opens with \"Homebrew\" settings.\nThe behaviour with 10.9.2 is not what I would expect (maybe I need to have it explained).  Again if all windows are closed but Terminal is left active and I start a new window using ⌘+n the new window has \"Basic\" settings instead of \"Homebrew\". I have checked this behaviour and it is consistent on both a MBP and Mini I have running with Maverics.\nIs this behaviour normal?\nIf so, is there a way to modify it, so that Maverics behaves like 10.7?\n\nA: You probably just missed a setting. The \"Default\" button makes whatever you have selected in the Preferences menu the default.\n\n(Selected in red)\nI do find it kind of annoying that you can't set Terminal to just open with the default settings, so you have to change it in two places. edit - turns out I'm completely wrong, it does change the Startup automatically if you change the default.

Someone told me today that I could plug this into my mac and split it up and use half the space for the Mac and half the space for Windows files. I'm only looking to do this in order to use Time Machine. I wasn't sure how to do this or if it's recommended.\n\nA: You could absolutely do this. I've been using a setup like that for a while now and it works great.\nWhat you want to do first is backup the files you have on the drive (backup the backup, haha) just so you can create two separate partitions on the drive. Formatting and partitioning the drive will make the data currently on the drive unavailable, so back up anything important!\nNow, open up the Disk Utility application and select the external drive in the left pane of the window. Then click on the Partition button and here you can select any amount of partitions you wish to make. Unless you know you will need more later you could settle with two, one for Time Machine and one for important documents/files.\n\nContinue by pressing the dropdown menu Volume Scheme and select 2 Partitions. You can now name each one and set their respective sizes, obviously a full Time Machine backup requires a fair amount of space so depending on how many backups you intend to have you might want to give this partition a bit of extra space.\nYou also want to specify which format (file system) to use for each partition. This is important if you intend to use the drive with other systems, for example Windows and Linux systems are not very fond of Mac OS Extended (Journaled) (aka. JHFS+). The Time Machine partition should be partitioned as Mac OS Extended (Journaled), but the other partition is up to you.\nFAT32 (called DOS or MS-DOS sometimes) is the standard file system used by Windows (I believe), it can be used with Mac without any problems. The only drawback is that you can only store files that are less than 4Gb each, which is a pain if you handle large video files.\nNTFS requires additional software for Macs to write, but it's (arguably) the most cross-compatible file system if you want to move files between different operating systems.\n\nIf you're only going to use the drive with a Mac, choose to format both partitions as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and press Apply. This will create two new partitions that should work natively with any Mac.\nQuick edit:\nExFAT can be an alternative to NTFS, depending on your Windows machine you might need additional software to read/write data to it.\n\nA: Well, thats right. You have to partition your external hard drive into two partions - one for Mac (formated withHFS+)m the other for Windows (formated with FAT/ExFAT or NTFS). But you couldn´t do this without to loose your data that are already on these hard drive.\nIf you want to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your external hard drive to your Mac.\n\n*Open the program \"Disk Utility\".\n\n*Select your external hard drive (be shure that you really select the external hard drive, not the partition).\n\n*Select third flag \"partition\"\n\n*On the lower left side click on the Plus sign to get a second partition.\n\n*Use the mover between the partions to correct the sizes.\n\n*For the Mac partition choose \"Mac OS Extended (journaled)\".\n\n*For the Windows partion choose \"ExFAT\", \"FAT\" or \"NTFS\"\n\n\nThat´s all (I hope so).\n", "Q: Can I install adobe Illustrator cs6 on 32-bit mac I have mac book pro, Processor: 2.16 Ghz intel Core Duo, Memory: 1 GB 667 Mhz DDR2 SDRAM, Model Identifier: MacBookPro1,2, Total Number Of Cores: 2, Boot ROM Version: MBP12.0061.B03.\nI tried to install adobe illustrator cs6 on it but I got forbidden mark on the application.\nIs there is any luck with that, or I have to buy new mac, I hope not\nThanks\n\nA: After checking the system requirements on the Adobe web site I could say: No, you can´t use Adobe CS6 Illustrator with your Mac because of the lack of RAM (1GB instead of 2GB) and no 64bit processor as Apple said it on your support document.\n", "Q: iMovie 10 Project Lost I created a new iMovie 10 project and there was no option to associate it with an event when I created it, which there is when I create one now.

How do I get it back?\n\nA: Make sure that it shows nothing over here:  under today's date or the title that you have given it. If there is indeed nothing, then try File > Update Projects and Events. If it still doesn't show up, then your only hope is that you have a time machine and that you backed it up. \nJust asking, what version of iMovie are you using?\n\nA: I had the same problem and this fixed it.

Syncing the phone enacts whatever your options are set to. In my setup that meant, hitting \"sync\" would cause: \n1  Backup- iphone backed up to the PC,  \n2  Calendar - iphone calendar synced with Oulook calendar on my computer\n3  Contacts, that is the iphone contacts (phone nums, and any other info like street address, email address)  - synced with gmail contacts.\nNOTE: In 2 & 3 syncing meant that any new contacts put in the iphone since the last sync, would be added to my gmail contacts and any new contacts in my gmail contacts that were not in my iphone were added to the iphone. So the syncing worked both ways. Handy, as if I ever lost my phone (apart from having the backup on the PC) my phone contacts would be in my gmail. \nI did not do the above sync for some months and when I went to do it recently I find that Apple has changed things. The dropdown list that had gmail on it for selecting which email application you wanted your iphone contacts to sync to, no longer had gmail on it and it had to defaulted to Outlook. Certainly don't want contacts to go there.\nSo I unselected the contacts sync so now when I sync only my calendar gets done.\nApple apparently wants to be less connectable to non apple entities, so wants people to sync contacts with icloud. Useless for my purposes. :(\nMy question:\nHOW TO sync, if possible, my iphone contacts with my gmail contacts even if it is a 2 step process. There are a lot of questions similar to this on the site but none seem to deal with the fact that I want to be sure that I do not cause any iphone contacts to be wiped in favour of what is in my gmail contacts or vice versa\n( Back a few years, I thought I would make a new start with a clean slate on my gmail contacts so wiped them all and then synced, thinking all my iphone contacts would appear in my gmail contacts. Because the syncing process updates the other entity with the latest actions from and to each other, the iphone was updated by the latest actions which were in gmail contacts, so wiped the iphone contacts clean! \nWas not happy)\nWith all this in mind, can anyone tell me how to do a 2 way update (sync) or if this is no longer possible to at least update my gmail contacts with any changes in my iphone contacts?\nHELP is appreciated. \n\nA: All google syncing is done through the wireless connection now.  Go to the Settings app, and choose Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\nChoose Add Account... and select Gmail from the list.  Follow the instructions to connect to your google account, and then select whether you want to sync more than your contacts.\nTested on my iPhone 3GS with iOS 6.1.3 (6.1.6 just updates a few security issues, no change to the contact/gmail sync)\n\nA: Here is link to a wiki on how to do it:\nHow to Import Contacts from Gmail to Your iPhone\nDepending on what iOS you are running the steps may be a little different, but I don't think so. iOS 7 doesn't have the \"mail, contacts, calendar\" setting, but I don't think the 3GS can update that far anyways. I don't think that this will wipe out your iPhone contacts, but one problem I seem to have with it, is that it creates a lot of duplicate contacts if you have duplicates in both accounts. I fixed this by getting an app called Simpler. It cleans up duplicates and works much better for merging contacts than the stock contacts app, among many other features. It actually replaced my contacts app. It may not be compatible with your phone though. \n", "Q: how to play local video files in thumbnail overlay (similar to skype video calls)?

It's simply the only App that can handle your device completely.\nIf you want to organize your media professionally, tag them manually or via great tools like Picard (from MusicBrainz), Metadatics, Tagger or something else. Organize it in Folder you like inside your Music Folder and don't let iTunes organize them. Then (if tagged correctly) drop them into iTunes.\nTo be sure you added the files, maybe add a Finder Tag to remember yourself in the future.\n", "Q: Editing the master of a single slide in Keynote In keynote, I know how to edit the theme and create a new master slide.

This might be the cause too.\n\n\nUpdate 2: The bounty and the accepted answer are both great - couldn't decide so I split the accept and the bounty between them.\n\nA: It sounds as if it could be a problem with the charger; I've seen a phone automatically pressing buttons etc on a touch screen device! Try using a different charger (both wall plug and cable) to see if that helps.\nThe fact you're having the issue on two devices suggests that it's not a device or iOS related issue.\n\nA: From http://www.righto.com/2014/05/a-look-inside-ipad-chargers-pricey.html?m=1\nYou might wonder if the power quality actually matters. The biggest impact it has is on touchscreen performance. The interference from bad power supplies is known to cause the touchscreen to behave erratically.[16] If your screen malfunctions when plugged into a charger, this is probably the cause.\nNote sixteen on that page links to a further technical explanation.\nYou probably have a faulty charger or perhaps even a counterfeit one.

Generally, this is the best use of your RAM, even if it doesn't 'look' like it's being used for anything.\n\nA: It depends on your daily workflow. I think it will not boost performance if you symlink some cache directorys to RAM (for example Safari) - your internet connection will be the bottleneck.\nBut for some special application (for example Photoshop) a working directory as a RAMdisk will give the application the needed kick.\nIf you want to try this have a look at Florian Bogner.

Is there any way to improve performance?\n\nA: Assuming that you are not using the full computational power of your CPU (if you were, then that would be the end of the optimization process, overcloking put aside), the only thing you can optimize is cooling.\nCPU can get throttled quiet heavily at high load after a certain point if the cooling system fails to evacuate the remaining heat, for two reasons : \n\n\n*\n\n*Fans and radiator can get quiet dirty, hence obstructing the airflow\n\n*The heat paste can be aging and/or of poor quality, not transferring heat between the CPU (the place were heat is generated) and the heatsink (the place were it is evacuated by the airflow), hence the heat buildup and necessity to throttle the CPU to prevent it from damaging itself.\n\n\nSo, as for the solutions : \n\n\n*\n\n*Cleaning the fan(s) AND radiator with pressurized air will get you a performance output proportional to their dirtiness and is quiet straightforward (just need a a Phillips and T6 screw driver).\n\n*As for the state of your thermal paste, and can diagnose it easily by putting your computer under a maximum load and looking at the reading of temperature sensors (the iStat Nano widget is enough) for both CPUS and Heatsink; too much a temperature difference between your CPU (should be 90-95°C) and your heatsink(should be more than 60-65°C) is the sign that could benefit from changing it. Be careful, as it is a very demanding and precise work, but could give you the extra performance you are looking for (don't expect too much of it though, maybe 10-20% ?).\n\n\nGuides are available on iFixit for all these operations.\n", "Q: Why does secondary screen turns black when selecting \"Mirror Display\" I have a MacBook Retina.\nWhenever I attach a secondary screen, projector or monitor and select the \"Mirror Displays\" option, the secondary screen turns all black.\nIt does not matter what connection I use.

I want to read PDF files in iBooks on an iPad.\nWhat is the current method to put PDF files on an iPad ? Is there a method that allows me to drag files somewhere so that the files will subsequently be pushed on the device ?\nUsing iTunes 11.1.5, when I select the Books tab with no device, I have a some kind of list ('Books') under Synchronize.\nHow do I add books to this list ? File -> Add to library doesn't do anything.\nPS: I'm not interested in techniques that involve a third party service, like sending to one self by email or using a file hoster. I'm looking for the most direct technique that involves only one iPad, one Mac and one wired or wireless connection between the two devices.\n\nA: Books are managed by the OS X application iBooks. You have to use iBooks in order to add books to your library. There is no Books section in your iTunes library where you can drag files to.\nSo just launch iBooks and drag files into the application window, and the books section in the synchronize tab will update immediately. Then, synchronize your device.\nAlso, if you try to add PDF files using File -> Add to Library, iTunes seems add those files as sound files, and they end up in the Music section of your Library, but won't be copied to your iOS device as PDF files.\nHere is thread on discussions.apple.com, and the answer that pointed me to the right direction:\nStumbleSally     Midwest - US\nRe: how to upload pdf to ipad\nMar 7, 2014 6:56 PM (in response to dawnrber)\nWith the recent update to iTunes (I'm now on iTunes 11.1.5), the previous directions for uploading an PDF and syncing it with iBooks didn't work for me because iBooks is now a separate program at least on Macs.  Maybe iBooks has been separate for a while, but anyway, here's what I had to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start iBooks.\n\n*Drag the PDF from my desktop to iBooks.\n\n*Start iTunes.\n\n*Plug in my iPad.\n\n*Stop the auto-sync/back up process in the center window by pressing on the small \"X\" (yours may not be set to auto sync when plugged in).\n\n*Select my iPad name in the left column.\n\n*Select Books from the menu bar just under the iTunes center window (you can skip this step if you want to sync all of your books).\n\n*Select the checkbox for the PDF(s) you want to sync (skip if you're syncing all books).\n\n*Select the Sync button in the lower right.\n\n*Once synced, go to iBooks on your iPad and in the Library, select Collections.\n\n*Select PDFs.\n\n\nYou should now see all of the PDFs you synced.\n\nA: If you don't want to connect the iPad to a computer, or load iBooks onto your computer, you have a few other options:\nIf the PDF is already online\nMost of the PDFs I load onto my iPad are already available online.  Go to the PDF in the iPad web browser of choice (Safari is fine), and then tap the middle of the page and choose \"Open in iBooks\" or \"Open in...\" and choose iBooks.  This will load that PDF into iBooks on the iPad for you.\nIf the PDF is on your computer, or not available online\nIf you don't have an online source for the PDF, you can load it into dropbox.  You then have two choices, either make the dropbox folder public and then go to the URL and follow the steps above for an online PDF, or load the DropBox app onto your iPad, and then use the \"Open in...\" function to open the PDF in iBooks.\n\nA: You can simply drag a PDF to the iTunes icon, and iTunes will add the PDF to the iTunes book list. You can also drag to the Library section of iTunes, if you have it open. (Note: OSX 10.9 adds a slight change to this answer. 10.9 Mavericks introduced a separate iBooks app, see below)\nHowever, the first time you add a PDF, iTunes creates a collection called PDF. You can see this collection above the list of book icons in the Books view of the Library.\n\nThis same Collection is then created on the iPad. Normally, by default, the iBooks apps opens the Books Collection, so you need to select \"Collections\" next to the 'Store' button in order to see the PDFs. It is very easy to add a PDF and not see it in the book list, because you forget to check the PDF collection!\n\nAlso, be sure to tell iTunes to sync the PDFs by selecting them just as you do books, but in the PDF 'folder' in iTunes.\nEdit: if you are running Mavericks (OSX 10.9), Apple has separated the iBooks function OUT of iTunes, and created a separate iBooks application. However, it functions in exactly the same way: just drag PDF to iBooks, and they will show in the PDF collection. (iTunes continues to sync books, even though they do not show in iTunes).\n\n\nA: I love my iPad but hate iTunes and it's needed to sync everything.  With all the cloud technology, you can simply download an app for say the OneDrive or Dropbox and download the pdf individually to your iPad.\nThat way, its also easy to sync it with your pc.\n\nA: Under your Books section in your iTunes Library (!= not your iPad library), just drag and drop your PDFs.\nThen synchronize your iTunes Library with your iPad. \n\nA: Use GDrive App for this issue:\nSync your iPhone with iTunes and open Apps. Then find GDrive, do drag and drop of your pdf or any text file in GDrive Documents section, sync again and it's done!\nTested\n", "Q: Apple's Profile Manager (MDM) is suddenly unable to updates settings on enrolled iPads So I just noticed that all new iPads (and old ones that we removed from groups and added to other groups) is no longer able to push settings to the iPads.\nThe iPads are all on very different networks, and installing apps on them all seem to work.\nI'm guessing this is a bug that was introduced in the last Server update.

If you want a quick recommendation, I'd say do not delete anything in this folder, simply because there's no way to know exactly how it'll effect your devices/syncing either today or in the future.\nI'm a programmer with over 15 years of experience and after running into an issue with iCloud that escalated Apple tech support didn't know how to solve I decided to start investigating how iCloud works. I've sifted through the guts of every part of iCloud & its syncing service for a couple weeks now. What I've found may help you and others at least understand why issues like this exist.\nSome of what I've found so far...\niCloud Secretly Syncs Data -> \niCloud syncs an enormous amount of information and a lot of it is done silently without your permission or knowledge. This raises security concerns as well as obvious privacy issues. \nSome examples of data being synced silently:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder preferences and tags\n\n*Search histories for Mail, Finder & Spotlight\n\n*Recent items including File names opened, folders, server/computer names you've accessed on your network\n\n*Wifi connection histories as well as the passwords that go along with them (encrypted)\n\n*Data from your Maps app\n\n\nThe list goes on, but you get the idea. I actually discovered a spotlight search I'd done over a year ago on an old Mac I no longer own synced to my brand new Mac with a clean installation. Perhaps Apple plans to do something visible with this synced data in the future, but without an advanced GUI to manage this kind of thing, they're taking a lot of liberties with your data. What I'd recommend is that you enable iCloud on as few computers as possible unless you know for certain no one you don't want will have access and that nothing you do on your synced computers includes activity you wouldn't want exposed.\nI'm not suggesting any of this is malicious. It is however, quite irresponsible to pass around data like this storing it on every device that connects to your iCloud account, which of course includes Apple's servers.\niCloud Sync Data is Complex\nI created a way to track how iCloud's sync data is stored on each computer. Hundreds of files are being synced, the data is coded (not encrypted) and very difficult to track, and the preferences for what's to be synced and how are mirrored in dozens of locations on your computer. All this makes it nearly impossible to fully understand the changes that occur during a sync. This is not only scary since developers have a hard time keeping things clean, but it also pretty much ensures a lot of issues when a sync goes wrong or there's a conflict in what's being synced. Check boxes just won't help you solve an iCloud issue.\nThe reason I went into all that is to illustrate the importance of not trying to adjust iCloud files manually. You could really cause a lot of damage and possibly lose data.\nThe bottom line... The number of iCloud issues like yours are growing and until Apple overhauls the system and/or offer a user interface to allow advanced management of the data being synced, I don't think it's going to get any easier.\nUnless you can get some insight on that folder's purpose directly from Apple, I'd leave it alone.\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: How to open a new Terminal tab in current working directory?

As a test, I selected a few messages and archived them, and afterwards they do not seem to show up in the trash or in any of the main email folders on my account.\n\n\nA: When you archive things in gmail, it just removes the 'inbox' label on it.

I asked to have this replacement power supply replaced one more time, and the 3rd power supply works fine.  Very odd, but things are operating fine now.\n", "Q: Selective Time Machine copy My Time Machine backup has 100+ dated backups.  What I'd like to be able to do is extract the backups for a particular folder to another location, with the result being like TM's archive (where multiple references to unchanged files are just links to 1 copy).  Effectively, this would be a copy of the original TM archive, but only for the selected folder (and it's subfolders).  Is there any utility which can do this?\n\nA: ditto didn't cut it, but rsync did.  It has a --link-dest option, that uses files in that folder as the base to link to for duplicates.  It's important that the source path for rsync end in /.\nTo prepare, in the location I'm going to store my copy, I create a symlink to the 1st archived folder I want to copy: ln -s -h -f /Volumes/MyBook\\ 2/Backups.backupdb/Mini/2012-08-02-003832/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/jerrybarrington/pathtothefolder/ /Volumes/MyBook\\ /Volumes/MyBook\\ 2/CK2.backup/Last.\nThen to copy: sudo rsync -a --delete --link-dest=/Volumes/MyBook\\ 2/CK2.backup/Last/ /Volumes/MyBook\\ 2/Backups.backupdb/Mini/2012-08-02-003832/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/jerrybarrington/pathtothefolder/ /Volumes/MyBook\\ 2/CK2.backup/2012-08-02-003832/.\nLastly, update the symlink to point to the new copy: ln -s -h -f /Volumes/MyBook\\ 2/CK2.backup/2012-08-02-003832/ /Volumes/MyBook\\ 2/CK2.backup/Last.\nFor each subsequent copy, repeat step 2, changing both instances of 2012-08-02-003832 to the next date I want, and then repeat step 3.\nsee http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/ for my inspiration.\n", "Q: How to restore the computer's username in Terminal?

I use the following script to attempt to eject all disks that aren't internal:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    eject (disks whose ejectable is true)\nend tell\n\nThis has the advantage of skipping volumes like MobileBackups as well as several others.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't eject network shares.\nIs there any way to get connected network shares in applescript?\nAs a +1, ideally this would skip things like optical disks as well.\nEDIT: Both answers so far have shared ways to eject specific network disks. This, of course, is easy and I know how to do it. What I'm specifically asking for is a way to attempt to eject every disk other than system internal disks, regardless of their name.\n\nA: I use Automator. I inserted 'Get Specified Finder Items', and named the target disks that I wanted to 'Get'. Only those named get chosen, but network drives do work. I then pipe this to 'Eject Disk'. \nThat's it.\n\n\nA: Easily done by using the -t option of the umount command. From the man page which you can read using man umount:\n-t type\n             Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on filesys-\n             tems of the specified type.  More than one type may be specified\n             in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be\n             prefixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types for which\n             action should not be taken.  For example, the umount command:\n\n                   umount -a -t nfs,hfs\n\nSo,\ndo shell script \"/sbin/umount -a -t nfs,smbfs\"\n\nshould umount all NFS and Windows/Samba shares mounted.\nEDIT: You may also want to use the -f option to force the action. Read the man page for details.\nEDIT2: Apologies, umount isn't behaving as advertised, at least on my Snow Leopard. So I'd do it like this remembering to change msdos to your desired filesystem type:\nset mounts to {}\nset mounts to paragraphs of (do shell script \"mount | grep msdos | cut -d ' ' -f3\")\n\n# Umount non busy filesystems\nrepeat with mount in mounts\n    set pid to (do shell script \"fuser -c \" & mount)\n    if pid is equal to \"\" then\n        # We use diskutil since classic unix umount cmd needs sudo/password \n        do shell script \"diskutil umount \" & mount\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nHTH\n\nA: Or you could just call the shell command..\ndo shell script \"/usr/sbin/diskutil unmount /Volumes/some_network_share\"\n\nNote that this might fail if you have open files so you can add force as such\ndo shell script \"/usr/sbin/diskutil unmount force /Volumes/some_network_share\"\n\n\nA: The command line utility /sbin/umount may be another solution to what you're looking for. The Mac OS keeps an alias to each of your mounted disks in a folder /Volumes. You can use this to your advantage and amount a drive listed there:\n$ umount /Volumes/Video\n\nSo you might want to create a shell script that lists the contents of /Volumes and attempts to eject them all, like this one:\nfor var in `ls /Volumes` ; do\necho Ejecting /Volumes/$var\numount /Volumes/$var\ndone\n\nIt will, however, fail to eject drives that cannot be ejected, like the current startup disk.\n\nA: This will only eject all network volumes:\n$ find /Volumes -maxdepth 1 -not -user root -print0 | xargs -0 umount\n\n\nA: If you want an AppleScript, I adapted the script posted at:\nShortcut to eject all external hard drives but not MobileBackups\nto this, and it works great.  I've placed the applet for this in my dock to use right before I unplug.\nset exceptionsList to {\"MobileBackups\", \"startup disk\", \"home\", \"net\"}\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set diskList to the disks\n    repeat with mountedDisk in diskList\n        if name of mountedDisk is not in exceptionsList then\n            eject mountedDisk\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Java applets in a browser on Mavericks? Is it possible to run a Java applet in any browser in MacOS 10.9.2? Chrome does not work with Java applets because it's a 32 bit app and the Java plugin is 64 bit only. Firefox and Safari both should be able to use Oracle's Java plugin, but it does not seem to work.\nThe official java.com download from Oracle is \"Version 7 Update 55\". It installs via a .pkg installer but the plugin still does not work in Safari or Firefox. I did verify that /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin exists, but it is not showing up in Safaris' list of plugins.\nOracle's installer adds a new \"Java\" system preference, with a security tab with a checkbox \"Enable Java content in the browser\". This is checked off. I check it on, click \"Apply\", and am prompted for my password. Then the dialog flashes and the box remains checked off. The plugin still does not work. I do note my console has a log line FAILURE: Job com.oracle.java.deployment.Helper is not loaded in launchd. There is an unresolved bug against OpenJDK for this problem that may be why it's not working. It is several months old.\nSome searching frequently turns up advice to re-enable Java 6.

Its sole HDD is a 750GB drive, formatted with Bootcamp. It's still running reasonably well, but in running a defragment pass on it, I've identified that there are a bunch of files which are refusing to be moved by the defragmenter (iDefrag).\niDefrag reports a POSIX error code of 5 when accessing the files. Picking one at random and trying to copy the file to another location in the shell also reports an error, which makes me think the problem is real and with the disk / FS. Output of cp is:\ncp: unity_nophysx.nexe: Input/output error\nError code 5 is 'access denied' as far as I'm aware, but the defrag process is running as administrator and running cp using sudo on the suspect file makes no difference.\nDisk Utility, fsck and the Apple Hardware Test all claim the disk is fine. No SMART errors reported, and while there were some permissions errors, they weren't with the files iDefrag is complaining about, and Disk Utility claims to have fixed them without complaint.\nThere are maybe a hundred or more corrupted files, but still a very small fraction of the drive. As far as I can tell, no system files or crucial data are affected. While it would be nice to retrieve the data, I don't mind reinstalling or going to backups. At this point I don't know if it's really the drive dying, just some bad sectors due to the drive being moved while writing, or some other minor corruption that can be worked around. I'm assuming the worst case, and that most likely I'll have to get a slightly larger HDD and clone the existing drive to avoid having to rebuild the system. \nMy question is really how I go about marking those broken files as properly broken and fixing or purging them, so that a clone of the disk will succeed and not get hung up on files / blocks it can't access. Disk Utility isn't seeing the problem, and I don't know of any command line or third party tools which will do the job. I don't want to write off the entire disk and start from scratch, as the drive seems otherwise healthy, so I'm looking for repair / diagnostic tools.\n\nA: If you are facing a healthy file system at the level of its structure and want to find files which have disk faulty blocks, here is how I would proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a full backup of your disk with Time Machine or Carbon Copy Cloner\nCheck this backup.\n\n*Run the following heavy and risky (in case you do have bad blocks outside of your filesystem structure) command (make sure the {} is quoted so filenames containing spaces work):\nfind / -type f -print -exec dd if=\"{}\" of=/dev/null bs=1m \\;\n\nThis heavy find command will print for any plain file its name (thus not reading it, but just its directory entry) and then continue making a full and fast read of all its data blocks.\nUpon hiting the first file containing bad blocks, this find will cause the kernel to log read error on /var/log/system.log, and it will either slow down or bring your system to a total halt.\nThis will mostly depend on the hard drive capacity to relocate the bad blocks found on its internal pool dedicated to this usual fix task.\nThis file containing bad blocks will be the last name printed by find.\nWrite down this file name on a piece of paper!\nLet's say that this file name is:\n/.DocumentRevisions-V100/.cs/ChunkStorage/0/0/0/9\n\nAt this point you may have the possibility to kill find quickly by hiting ctrl+C. If killing it nicely is failing, just crash your Mac.\nUpon rebooting your Mac, directly check the file containing bad blocks:\ndd if='/.DocumentRevisions-V100/.cs/ChunkStorage/0/0/0/9' of=/dev/null bs=1m\n\nIf the command terminate correctly, then the error was light enough for your disk to be able to read this file and reallocate the bad blocks.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the command doesn't terminate, you won't be able to kill it\nnormally, your data is totally lost, and you will have to crash your Mac\nonce more.\nIn this last case, you have to consider replacing your disk and to work from your last backups. Some other files might also contain bad blocks and may have stayed undetected since a long time as long as you didn't read them.\nThe kernel won't fire a read error on a block you never read.\n\nA: Reboot in single user mode by holding the Command + S during boot. When you see a prompt (should look like root # or something similar), type fsck -f and press Return. This is Mac's built-in filesystem consistency check tool and allows you to find and repair errors with the startup file system. Run this command until you don't see **The volume [volume name] was modified.** or the tool fails three times in a row.\nIf the tool fails, it might be indicative of a larger problem (but I couldn't tell you what without seeing the output of the tool). In any case, make sure you've backed up everything you can before running any disk tool. When you've finished, type reboot into the prompt and press enter to (you guessed it!) reboot your computer.\nFor extra information you can find the fsck manual pages here.\n\nA: I would highly recommend DiskWarrior for rebuilding disk catalogs and for scanning for potentially damaged files. \nDuring the catalog rebuild, it can also let you know if it experiences a delay because of disk malfunction.\n\nA: Working off Buscar's answer, you can do this automatically using some pretty heavy command line foo.\nsudo find / -type f -print0  | xargs -0 -I{} dd if='{}' of=/dev/null bs=1m 2>&1 | grep 'error' >>badfiles.txt  & \n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo:Admin mode \n\n*find -print0: absolute path\n\n*xargs -0 -I{} : substitute {} in the next command\n\n*dd 2>&1: redirect std error to stdout\n\n*pipe stdout to grep looking for string error\n\n*Append results to a list file.( note: This should be on external media if you believe your internal drive is iffy)\n\n\nA: As you say, it is not even clear those files are damaged, at least your Mac does not thinks so.\nEvery OS makes unmovable files that are needed for its operations (Restore points, currently active files ect....). Some defrags will show them, some will not.\nThe fact that you can not access or move them does not mean they are damaged.\nNormally Mac's are very good in taking care of them self.\nUsing Apple maintenance is done by: open the Terminal and type: \nsudo periodic daily weekly monthly \n\nfollowed by Return, enter your Administrator password, and OS X will take care of things for you.\nLook in the Console for the reports on those if you are interested.\nWhile in the Console look (search) for any I/O errors that would indicate your disk is starting to have problems, to compliment the Disk Utility and the fsck findings.\nOn occasion I use a free tool called OnyX for additional maintenance task. It is made by French and as they food it is just great :)\nOnyX is a multifunction utility for OS X which allows you to verify the startup disk and the structure of its system files, to run miscellaneous tasks of system maintenance, to configure some hidden parameters of the Finder, Dock, QuickTime, Safari, Mail, iTunes, login window, Spotlight, and many of Apple’s applications, to delete caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become cumbersome, and more.\nWith all this said, I am not questioning your decision for using the defragmenter (iDefrag) since I do not know it, but rather offering alternative solutions.\n\nA: As unreasonable as it sounds, before doing anything you should duplicate all your data to a known good drive. If booting from the installer and copying the data fails, there is a command line utility called 'dd' that can do low-level duplicating and in a far more uncompromising way.\n man dd\n\nfor more information on dd including use and proper syntax.\n\nAnother vote for Matt's post, boot single-user mode, and run\n fsck -fy \n\nover and over until fsck stops reporting errors.\n\nA vote for Adam's post, DiskWarrior is a simple to use but very powerful application that will report HDD failures, check individual files for errors and repair them if possible, and rebuild and optimize directory structures.\n\nAnother possible solution that may sound unreasonable but is often a last ditch attempt to recover data with a lot of annacdotal evidence for success is to pull the drive, protect it from moisture using a couple layers of freezer bags, and place it in your freezer for 30-45 minutes. Then while the drive is cold, mount the drive in an external usb dock, and use another temporary system to again attempt to copy the corrupted data to another drive. Generally, this is used if there is a hardware problem and the drive is failing. If you can duplicate the entire drive with your data intact, this is ideal, as often a repartition and reformat will give the drive a new lease on life.\n\nA: For a single file that cannot be read in its entirety due to a disk read error, you can use the dd utility to duplicate the file to an external volume, substituting NUL bytes for the blocks that cannot be read. It is highly recommended to duplicate to a different volume (e.g. \"USB Disk\" in the example below).\nExample:\ndd if=/path/to/damaged/file of=/Volumes/USB\\ Disk/file bs=512 conv=noerror,sync\n\nBy using 512-byte blocks, the maximum number of readable blocks will be recovered.\nRecovery may take a long time, as the kernel will block for some time on each failed read.\n", "Q: Is my iPhone locked with iCloud or not? I don't have SIM Card yet I bought an iPhone 5C from a friend and I'm not sure if it's Activation Locked or not and I don't have a SIM card yet. He hasn't used it and didn't know anything about that, he got it second hand.  \nWhen I got the phone it was stuck at the lock screen because of too many password attempts. I've put it in restore mode, and now the phone is \"formated/restored\"\nWhen turning the phone back on, it first asks my country, then it wants me to connect to Wi-Fi, which I do, and next it says I need to put a SIM card (not pin-locked) in.\nIf the iPhone was Activation locked, does it ask for the Apple ID after you connect to Wi-Fi or after you put a SIM card in?\nCan you provide a step-by-step guide?\n\nA: The easiest manner to check is from this web site:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/\nIf that fails, the older method still works in all cases and Apple describes the steps here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5818\nExpand the portion that says (in the english version) How do I check for Activation Lock before purchasing a used device?\nIt states:\n\nFollow each of these steps to make sure that you can use the device\n  you purchase:\nTurn the device on and slide to unlock. If the passcode lock screen or\n  the home screen appears, the device has not been erased. Ask the\n  seller to completely erase the device by going to Settings > General >\n  Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Do not take ownership of any\n  used iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch until it has been erased.\nBegin the device setup process. After choosing a language, choosing a\n  country, and connecting to a network, the device will begin\n  activation. If you are asked for the previous owner’s Apple ID and\n  password, the device is still linked to their account. Hand the device\n  back to the seller and ask them to enter their password.\n\nOn iOS 7, the part where you are asked if you want to enter your Apple ID is the step that means it's not locked to another iCloud account. If you cannot enter your new Apple ID from the setup you will see a prompt to enter an existing password and can conclude that it's not released from the previous owner.\nSince you're not getting to that step, either get a SIM card that satisfied the carrier lock on that device or perhaps connect it to iTunes and see if you can restore the device. In my experience, iTunes also checks if the device is locked and will tell you to remove the iCloud lock before it lets you restore the device when it's at the point where you can start the setup assistant.\n", "Q: 4s phone screen is frozen Screen on phone is frozen diplaying wall paper and slide to unlock.

While I need converter to use iPhone5S charger, instead I am using an iPad2 charger. \nIs it OK if I do that? What's the different (in terms of voltage, ampere, and so on) of iPad2 and iPhone5S charger? \n\nA: As you can see from Apple's product page for the 12W USB Power Adapter, it's compatible with iPhone 5S. The output voltage is the same in both, except the 12W adapter gives a higher amperage (2.4A instead of 1A), but your phone can regulate it's intake.\nI use my iPad Air's charger occasionally with my iPhone 5S with no problems.\n", "Q: Google Calendar subscription shared with iCloud Is it possible to share a Google Calendar subscription with multiple iCloud users?

I have been notified that this calendar will now be updated on a regular basis. \nI have been unable to locate any type of sync settings or app that would keep these two calendars in sync. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You can not sync a Google calendar and an iCloud calendar out of the box.

So I reset my iPad signature to \"sent from my iPad\".  Guess what? An email Is sent from my iPhone g-mail app was signed \"sent from my iPad\". Does anybody have a fix aside from just using the signature \"sent from my iPhone/iPad\"?\n\nA: The Gmail app syncs your signature to your account, not just your device.

Blued is your Bluetooth daemon process and syslogd is is your logging console daemon (crash reported, console log files etc). Blued is connected to your console daemon so I guess that blued is actually the cause of your problem while the syslogd issue is only a result of the blued's problems. Looking at the error it seem that there is an communication error and your blued process is just waiting for a response from a device.

This note may help:\nhttp://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2009/12/fixing-keyboard-type-problems.html\n\nA: It might be this since you have the second input set as Pinyin-\nAutomatically switch to a document’s input source\nChoose an input source for a document and have it used every time you work in the document until you close it, even if you switch to other documents that use other input sources in the meantime.\nThis option appears only when you add a second input source.\nChinese input sources (such as Pinyin-Simplified or Pinyin-Traditional), Korean input sources (such as 2-Set Korean or HNC Romaja), and Japanese input sources (such as Romaji, Hiragana, or Katakana, grouped in Kotoeri) include numerous options. If you added one of these input sources, switch to it, then open and search its help to learn about the options.\n", "Q: If I bought someone's Macbook, can he spy on me? What if someone sold me his Macbook he doesn't need anymore?\nWhen I remove old home profile and reinstall OS via Cmd+R (btw, would I need sudo pass for that?), after that would previous owner be able to block Macbook remotely or get any data about it?\n\nA: In short:\nTo be completely sure you would want to go to disk utility when booted with Cmd+R and erase your MacOS partition. \nSome more:\nAt this point (after erase+reinstall), assuming there were no hardware modifications (in theory you could install hardware tracking modules, wireless microphones and such, but it's rather corporate espionage/P.I./high profile legal domain) you should be good to go.\nBooting with Cmd+R and doing just reinstall, without erasing partition can - in theory - leave some parts out.\nRemote access is then controlled from system settings and remote wipe can be performed, if you are connected to iCloud (or have some 3rd party app running, which after partition erase you would not have).\nThe most careless would be to just remove user profiles on newly bought Mac, as there might still be some apps running in background, that you would not even see in Applications folder.\n\nA: I second @Marek, and want to add: You should also make sure you reinstall from a clean installation disk / or an OSX installer you downloaded on a clean machine. The installer on the installation partition might also have been tampered with.\nIn the end, it depends on the level of paranoia you choose to satisfy...\n\nA: Yes, someone could spy you. There is one user that could be enabled named \"root\". When this user is enabled and can be used as a Mac OS X user he can not only spy you but he can do everything to your machine he likes. Sudo user is not the same as the root user because a sudoer is given root privileges for a certain time, the root user has no privilege limits at all.\nTo make your mac \"safe\" it's better to do a clean install.\nEDIT: Requested a more detailed solution\nYou can install your mac in multiple ways (optical disk, USB/FireWire/Lightning connected external drive, network and recovery partition) but when launching your mac you can ask the machine for it's startup disk menu when holding down the option key (alt key) when you turn on the machine. Choose the startup disk that has the recovery/installation software. An installer or recovery will start up and need to follow the steps below. \nNote: If you don't want to lose all of your data make a (time machine) backup first \nAfter booting recovery or installation software and you're inside the recovery/installing mode you need to do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*start disk utility \n\n*erase the volume where Mac OS X is current installed (probably named Macintosh HD)\n\n*quit disk utility \n\n*start Mac OS X installer\n\n*Select the erased volume if needed and start continue the installer\n\n*After a while the machine will reboot as if it came out of the factory. \n\n", "Q: Can iTunes be configured to have the 'Store' be default screen at startup? I like to use iTunes predominantly to check things out on the iTunes store (and make the occasional purchase), not to browse a library of downloaded media by default.\nIs there a setting or way to make the store be the default initial screen in iTunes for Mac?\n\nA: There may be other even more elegant ways to do it, but here's one way to automate the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Keyboard Maestro (it's a paid app, but you can try it out at least and see if you like it - it's an extremely powerful app that is worth purchasing if you are committed to enabling tweaks such as this one), and open the app.\n\n*In the 'Macros' pane, click the + button at the bottom of it to create a new Macro. Give the Macro a name as prompted. Click on 'New Trigger' and select 'Application Trigger'. Select iTunes. Then under iTunes where it says 'Activates' click on that and change it to 'Launches'.\n\n*Now click on 'New Action' further down. An 'Actions' pane will appear to the left. Scroll down or search within the pane to find 'Execute an Applescript'. Double click on it or drag and drop it into the 'No Action' box in the right-hand pane.\n\n*Insert the following code in the Applescript box:\ntell application \"System Events\"\ntell application \"iTunes\" to activate\n    delay 1.0\n    keystroke \"H\" using {command down, shift down}\nend tell\n\nAnd the process is complete. It is already enabled in your list of active Keyboard Maestro Macros and you can test by opening iTunes afresh to see the Store Home open by default when it opens.\nN.b. there's a 1 second delay in the above Applescipt code due to it not working if I didn't include the brief delay. Tweak it as desired, maybe less than a second is fine but 1 second is not much to wait when launching the whole app anyway.\nAnd also to explain: ⇧+ ⌘ + H is the default assigned hotkey for Store > Home for iTunes in OS X, so that's all this Keyboard Maestro macro is emulating. (Obviously, the hotkey combination can be customised in System Preferences keyboard shortcuts.)\nUpon brief googling it appears there may not be any free apps/tools available to automate such a 'execute applescript/hotkey action upon app launch so Keyboard Maestro might possibly be the only way. But I only did a quick search, there's probably some tool on github somewhere that can do it, and it'd be nice to know of any free solutions for this problem too.\n", "Q: Screen Shot or convert an ArtPro file using Automator I am attempting to turn an ArtPro (.ap) image into a pdf, but I can't find any existing or downloadable actions to do anything other than open a .ap file. Because of this I have resolved to Screen Print the picture, save, then convert, but now I can't find anything that will screen capture the image either D: Please help!!\n\nA: You can use the Grab tool, or just a variery of keyboard shortcuts to screencapture any part of whole screen.

We met to do the exchange. When I tried to set up, she couldn't remember the ID or the password. Now I can't get hold of her and am stuck with an iPad that doesn't function. What can I do?\n\nA: You cannot do anything technically to get past it.  Your only method is to get back to the seller.  If they have disappeared, then perhaps you might want to entertain the possibility that you have been sold a stolen iPad.  In this instance, then rather than have a very expensive paperweight, you might want to report it to the Police.  There is a slim chance that it has been reported as stolen, and they may be able to reunite it with it's true owner, in which case there is also a chance that they may reward you in some way to make up for your loss, or (perfect scenario) they will have already replaced it on insurance, and will simply unlock it for you and let you keep it.\n", "Q: How do you delete albums (or large groups of songs) from your iOS device using iTunes Match? I forced my iPhone to download everything in iCloud (create All Music playlist, download, wait...). Now I want to delete about 25% of my music from the device. iOS 7 only allows you to delete one song at a time. How can I delete albums or ideally large groups of music at a time?\n\nA: First, turn off iTunes Match (temporarily) on your iOS device: Settings > Music > iTunes Match > Off\nConnect the iPhone (or iPad) to iTunes. Under DEVICES, find yours and highlight Music. Manually organize and delete songs, albums, artists, genres, etc. \nOnce iTunes is done updating, disconnect.

Is there a way to insert uparrow that is not a wingding in word with a keyboard shortcut? Whenever I insert the symbol from the character browser it switches my font to wingdings and it's frustrating because then I have to manually switch back to the original font.\n\nA: Use something like Dash (Free with IAP) or TextExpander (Paid) to define custom shortcuts for those symbols. Next time you want to insert Up Arrow, you just have to type .upar and it won’t change your fonts (since they’re pasted as plain text).\nUpdate: I didn’t realize that you change the font manually. This still can be solved with TextExpander (but not Dash). All you need to is to choose Rich Text (selecting font that have Up Arrow) for the expanded custom arrow, and put a space afterward in the font you use in Microsoft Words.\nEg. You use Monotype Corsiva in Microsoft Words — by assuming that it doesn’t contain Up Arrow. Define your expanded words where Up Arrow is selected as Lucida Grande that supports arrows. Right after the arrow, change the space into Monotype Corsiva. This way, you use two fonts in Microsoft Words, but only Up Arrow is in Lucida Grande. \n\nP.S. There is an Alfred’s worflow called Symbols that lets you search through the unicode, paste it into your active Text Editor. Take a look at how it works.\n\nA: I think that must be a Word \"feature\" to change to Wingdings, instead of an OS function. \nIf this is something you need frequently, you can try this solution from @0942v865:\nTo summarize: copy your favorite arrow symbol and put it into a text file.  \n{\n    \"~a\" = (\"insertText:\", \"⬆\");\n}\n\nSave it to: ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict\n(You will probably have to create the folder.)\nRestart your application, and now you should be able to type optiona (a for arrow) to get an up-arrow...\n", "Q: Mirroring iPhone 4 (iOS 7) to Mac without AirPlay Mirroring As the iPhone 4 does not support AirPlay Display Mirroring, is there any way to mirror the phones display OTA onto a Mac (or even any other computer) without using a non-OTA method such as a VGA/HDMI adapter or either Veency, ScreenSplitr/iDemo, or Display Recorder (I have no intent on recording the screen, however the 'Live View' feature of Display Recorder does not work on this device)? \nNote: This particular phone is running iOS 7.0.6 and is jailbroken.\n\nA: I don't have any experience with jailbreak, but I think one possible solution would be to see if you can run a VNC server on the iPhone.  VNC is a screen sharing protocol: the server runs on the machine whose screen you want to view and control, the client runs on the machine that you want to sit in front of.\nI did a Google search for \"iPhone VNC server\" and came up with this link which describes how to set up Veency (jailbreak required) to do this.\n", "Q: To how many bluetooth receptors can I send sound from my MacBook?

Apple details how you can store documents onto your iCloud Drive here\n\nA: As this question has been reactivated, I will give an answer based on macOS Sierra and iCloud Photo Library.\nIf you photos are not already in the Photos app, import them into the Photos app.\nThen in your iCloud settings (System Preferences > iCloud), ensure the check box next to \"Photos\" is selected, then press \"Options\" for Photos and ensure the check box for \"iCloud Photo Library\" is selected as shown:\n\nThe images will then upload to iCloud, one thing to be aware of as you mention thousands of images - the free tier of iCloud is 5GB, so you may need to purchase extra storage.\n\nA: You can save them to Photo Stream. Import the photos into iPhoto and they will be uploaded to Photo Stream (providing Automatic Upload is enabled).\nYou can then find the photos in the Photo Stream section of iPhoto or in ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub/\n", "Q: How to properly backup OS X Server (Mavericks) I've been reading various articles from a Google Search on this topic and it seems there is no clear solution as many debate what works/doesn't work.

I run the following services on it: Caching, DHCP, DNS, File Sharing, Open Directory, Profile Manager, Software Updates, Time Machine, Websites, VPN, and Xcode. \nI'd like to use Time Machine, but read it won't backup Open Directory. Carbon Copy also states it will not backup OD. I'd like to be able to restore my entire system from a disk image if possible if something were to go wrong. \nWhat solution(s) do any of you OS X Sys Admins perform to accomplish this? Also, is there a way to automate creating an archive of Open Directory?\n\nA: I use Carbon Copy Cloner (actually Super Duper - but same idea) to back up my system drive to another drive.\nAdditionally, I have another CPU which acts as an Open Directory Replica in case the first one goes down.\n(granted, this means you need 2 CPUs - so it's not the cheapest solution!)\nYou can find some more info about OD Replica here:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/12/a-power-users-guide-to-os-x-server-mavericks-edition/2/\n", "Q: Can I delete this recursive link to my Home directory?

We don't want to hack it in and we don't want to violate any EULA's, we just want virtual Mac OS X in our environment. Does this mean we need new hardware in the data center to support this?\n\nA: You can't run OS X virtualized or not, on non-Apple-branded hardware per the software license agreement.  You would need Apple hardware to virtualize it and be compliant with the EULA.\nMavericks EULA\n", "Q: How fast is 256GB to 128GB on mid-2013 MacBook Air? I've tried finding the comparison reviews of the performance differences between 128GB and 256GB PCIe SSDs of mid-2013 MacBook Air 11\" and 13\" (which now have been carried over as the early-to-mid-2014 MacBook Air 11\" and 13\", too), but some comparisons don't even mention which SSD they've tested, and others only present a single size for the mid-2013 Air models.\nHow much faster is the 256GB SSD compared to the 128GB on mid-2013 MacBook Air?\n\nA: Sandisk/Marvell drives are about ~500MB/s write and Samsung drives are ~700MB/s write speed. Both have around 700MB/s read speeds.\nIt's important to note that while these are different, under regular use it's very unlikely that either will have any sort of performance implications. Benchmarks tell very little about day-to-day performance.\n\nA: According to Macworld testing of mid-2013 and early 2014 MacBook Air 11\"  and 13\" laptops, it would appear that 128GB drives are generally capable of 3xx MB/s to 4xx MB/s sequential write speeds and 6xx to 7xx MB/s for read speeds, whereas the 256GB model is capable of 5xx to 6xx MB/s writes and 6xx to 7xx MB/s reads.  The numbers are from Blackmagic Disk Speed Test, which presumably is smart enough to test with a higher queue depth.\nAccording to AnandTech, the 256GB model has 3xx MB/s for both the sequential writes and reads with a queue depth of 1, and 700MB/s for write and 800MB/s for read with a queue depth of 32.  AnandTech is also providing information about random writes/reads, but only for the 256GB model, so, it cannot be compared with the 128GB one.\nAccording to other websites that have tested the 128GB and 512GB models, the 512GB doesn't go above 7xx MB/s for either reads or writes, either.\nSo, if you're interested only in performance alone, then 256GB would appear to provide an extra kick compared to 128GB, but 512GB would hardly make a difference to 256GB (at least as far as sequential reads at an unknown queue depth are concerned).  THIS IS ONLY BASED ON THIS INCOMPLETE TESTING DATA AND SEQUENTIAL WRITES/READS AT UNSPECIFIED QUEUE DEPTH.  Random writes/reads are what would matter for swapping, and comparison test data is missing for such metric.\nIn other words:\n\n\n*\n\n*sequential writes (with XXX queue depth) on 128GB is about 1&half;× slower compared to 256GB and 512GB model (and the difference between 256GB and 512GB is negligible)\n\n*sequential reads (with XXX queue depth) are effectively the same between 128GB, 256GB and 512GB drives -- from 6xx to 7xx MB/s\n\n*sequential writes (with queue depth of 1) are XXX\n\n*sequential reads (with queue depth of 1) are XXX\n\n*sequential writes (with queue depth of XX) are XXX\n\n*sequential reads (with queue depth of XX) are XXX\n\n*random writes are XXX; model XXX is XXX faster than XXX\n\n*random reads are XXX; model XXX is XXX slower than XXX\n\n", "Q: Why can't I copy and paste web content into a Pages document? For some time I have been able to copy content from a web page and paste it into a Pages document and it would accept both text and images. But since the last update to Pages it will only display the text and if I want to include images I have to copy them and paste them individually. \nIs there another way to do this that I am not aware of?\nI am running Pages 5.2 (1860) on OS X 10.9.2\nThanks\n\nA: It is often useful to sleep on a problem, or rather get some sleep after you ask the question. It came to me this morning that the problem might not be pages at all, but the browser. I have been using Chrome recently, so I decided to revert back to Safari to try the same process. I did the copy from Safari and pasted into Pages and the pictures came right in. It wasn't Pages after all.\n\nA: Actually, it IS Pages - at least partially. If you create a new document in Pages and make sure the \"Document Body\" checkbox is checked in the Document section of the Inspector for the new document, the graphic will paste. (Note if you UNCHECK the Document checkbox, the graphic WILl NOT paste.)\nThe work around I use is to create a new document, paste into it, then copy it again in that document and paste it into the original target document.\nIt is a bug in Pages even if it is exclusive to content copied from Safari. It is also something Apple still needs to fix.\n\nA: The following works from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250452308\n\nIf you want to consistently preserve drag and drop links (and text), or those that are copied to the clipboard, then open a blank page in TextEdit (rich text mode), and select Edit menu : Substitutions : Smart Links.\nNow when you drag/drop, or copy/paste from Safari, Firefox, or Brave, into TextEdit, all link information is preserved. It is a simple matter to drag/drop, or copy/paste this TextEdit content of the correct URL link into the Pages document with like effect.\n\n", "Q: Alfred 2 script filter executable loading unusually slowly I created a workflow for Alfred for searching DuckDuckGo and automatically displaying the results in the window, with a script filter. \nIt takes ~4 seconds to start from Alfred.

Also, if I use it and then use it again quickly, that extra wait time doesn't happen. It would be nice to at least allow the cache to live longer if that's possible, but I have no idea what is being cached. \n\nA: I feel stupid now. It turns out that HTTPS was being slow the first time because it has to check the cert or something. It has nothing to do with Alfred.

My iTunes library is, due to its size, stored on an external drive which is connected to my Time Capsule.\nThe problem is that every time I close iTunes (and sometimes even when I haven't closed it) the computer appears to forget where the library is stored. Sometimes it will revert to the default location on my SSD, but most of the time it just goes blank, with no file location stored at all.\nIt's easy enough to re-set iTunes so it can find its library again, but given the library's size it's rather time-consuming for the computer to scroll through everything and tag its file address. And I might end up having to do that every couple of hours while iTunes is running.\nI've already ruled out the strength of my wifi connection as a possible cause. Has anyone else ever heard of this? If so, how did you resolve it?\nThanks in advance...  :-)\n\nA: Mavericks has a new external-hard-disk power management system in place which would turn off the hard-disk (only concerns external drives) if it's not used for a certain amount of time. \nI suspect this is what's causing the lag rather than iTunes forgetting the location of the library. \n", "Q: Mac mini with intermittent wifi connnectivity problems Mac mini (2.4 core 2 duo, 10.6.8) has served well for years. Now it seems to be having wifi connectivity problems with no rhyme or reason to their appearance. Several other devices (laptops, phones) on the same wifi network can all connect and use the network with no issues. Sometimes connectivity is dropped altogether and later re-establishes.

Wifi was \"connected\" but no data was flowing. The other issues (when the connection drops completely) I have not yet reproduced while debug logging.\nIs there some other way I can investigate this problem, or should I just give up, assume the interface is dying, and buy a USB wifi dongle?\n\nA: Sometimes that is caused by WiFi Chanel overcrowding.\nTry changing the WiFi channel for Mac Mini.\n", "Q: Import date of a certificate into keychain?

And is there a fast way to delete all pics or one by one... I have over 2000 pics! I have a iPhone 4S.\n\nA: Camera Roll contains photos you have taken on your device, accessible locally. \nPhoto Stream is a set of photos synced to all your devices, and only takes the last 1000 photos or from the past 30 days, whichever comes first. Photo Stream does not affect your iCloud storage. \n(iCloud) Photo Library is where photos can be uploaded to, outside of the photos you take on your iDevice (so DSLR photos can be in Photo Library) and it does affect and consume your iCloud storage.\n\nA: If you use iPhoto you can copy all the Photos from \"Photo Stream\" (On iCloud and synced to all connected Devices) to the \"Photo Library\" (On your Mac's Hard Drive) and then delete them all from the Photo Stream (Will also be removed from all Devices).\n", "Q: Why the launchd has multiple instances per user (not only me and root, but also _spotlight and _windowserver)? I found that the launchd process has multiple instances in the process list. What is looking interesting is that there are four users under which these launchd processes are running:\n\n\n*\n\n*root\n\n*< current_user[i.e. me] >\n\n*_windowserver\n\n*_spotlight\n\n\nAs described in Apple's docs (Creating Launch Daemons and Agents), launchd will be launched per user. But why are the users which requires launchd such as _spotlight and _windowserver. I would expect only root and <current_user[i.e. me]>. Why both users (_spotlight and _windowserver) require the launchd? I would appreciate for any references to Apple docs or any other resources.\nthe process parent-child relations are as following:\nkernel_task(0,root) -> launchd(1,root) -> launchd(130, _windowserver)\n                                       -> launchd(150, <current_user[i.e. me]>)\n                                       -> launchd(470, _spotlight)\n\n\nA: The clear answer is that by separating processes into users, you separate the permissions that each process inherits. This is a long standing unix idiom for security and control of resources by placing per user limits on things like open files and memory and even threads/processes.\nOn OS X - spotlight needs to spawn processes to index files, window server is responsible for bringing up the lock screen, and things to prepare for the first graphical user to log in. Root is the defacto admin account with broad levels of power and permissions. Each user process gets a launchd to start the programs and things they need.\nAs far as official documentation, I'd start with this article on Daemons and Services.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html\nIt shows the user vs system level split already in the first page. You can search for other launchd topics from that link if needed (or use Xcode to browse the documentation offline).\n", "Q: remote \"desktop mouse\" with Magic trackpad emulator for iPad or Mac Book I would like to control my desktop Mac with a Magic trackpad or Magic mouse \"emulation\".\nI have an iPad and an Macbook Air too.

Most rubiers will tell you don't even bother useing the ruby that ships with OS X. But you can install multiple versions of ruby, and you'll definately need a ruby version manager if you intend to use lots of gems. \nruby was once quite easy to use, but now, the number of versions that necessarily need to be supported are legion, and gem developers sometimes force you to install a new version of ruby at some other version when you already have a perfectly good ruby installation! Grr. ruby is really starting to chafe, because while the support information might be out there, it is looking more and more like a fishing reel that has birdnested. IMO, ruby is broken, someone's going to have to pull it out and get it neatly reeled in for it to be fixed, and I'm just not up to it. I'm not the guy. Not me.\nbrewinistas enthusiasm notwithstanding, the homebrew package manager has growing pains typical of an immature package management solution. I use MacPorts to manage... all my installations, but also the various versions of ruby installations that are necessary to use the gems I want. MacPorts requires an appropriate version of xcode; xcode_5.1.1.dmg is the most recent version for Mavericks. rvm uses MacPorts by default if it is installed. \nIt appears from your provided logs that you're missing stuff. That's what's nice about MacPorts (and any mature package manager); it takes care of the dependecies for you if they're not installed.\nInstall MacPorts\n curl -Ok https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2\n\n tar xf MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2\n\n cd MacPorts-2.2.1\n\n ./configure\n\n make\n\n sudo make install\n\n cd ..\n\n rm -rf Macports-*\n\n sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate\n\nadd MacPorts to your $PATH:\n export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\n\ntake a look at what MacPorts has for ruby\n port search ruby |less\n\nand/or just install nokogiri\n sudo port -vsk install ruby19 libxml2 libxslt \n\n sudo gem install nokogiri\n\n port -vfp clean ruby19 libxml2 libxslt\n\nif there's trouble try\n sudo port upgrade outdated\n\nMacPorts won't affect OS X version of anything, nor homebrew (except to make it superfluous) and keeps everything it installs in /opt making deinstallation a breeze (but this has nothing to do with where ruby keeps its gems, ~/.gem ). But you should really get to know and love MacPorts, it is your friend.\nto completely uninstall MacPorts\n sudo port -dfp uninstall --follow-dependencies installed\n\n sudo port -dfp uninstall all\n\n sudo rm -rf /opt/local  \n\n sudo rm -rf /Library/Tcl/macports*\n\n", "Q: How can I use Torify for an App on OS X I want one of my applications to use Tor; however the app itself does not have proxy setting and it uses the System proxy. The problem is that I don't want to set my system proxy and I just want this one application to use tor.\nI searched a bit for a solution, I came up with torify. I have installed tor and torify using brew and everything works fine and for example I can force curl to use tor like this: torify curl ifconfig.me 2\nTo use torify, I need to start my app from Terminal. For this, I use open -a myapp. However, this does not make myapp to go behind the tor proxy.I think it's because of the open command and I think I have to open myapp somehow directly. By the way, myapp does not work when I try to run it by opening the executable file inside the /Contents/MacOS folder.\nDo you guys have any suggestion?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Tell your command where your myapp.app resides\nYou need to provide the open command an absolute or relative path to the application, unless the executable is already within your $PATH, or you change your working directory to the location in the filesystem where your myapp.app is (in my examples, myapp.app is the Applications folder, the home Applications folder, a folder called someotherplace, and the Shared folder, respectively).\n open /Applications/myapp.app\n open ~/Applications/myapp.app\n open ../someotherplace/myapp.app\n cd && cd ../Shared/ && open myapp.app\n\nYou can also type your open command and hit spacebar, and drag your application from anywhere into the Terminal, and the path will be provided.\nThere is another way\nYou can execute your executable using its full path  and adding the ampersand.  This will run it in the background so your terminal isn't tied up:\n ./myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp &\n /Applications/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp &\n cd /Volumes/externaldisk/projects/thisone/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS && ./myapp &\n\nAnd interestingly, using this method you can launch as many instances of your app as you have memory to do so.\nTo use torify with your myapp.app\nI'm reasonably sure you need to launch it like this to use torify (assuming your myapp.app is in the /Applications folder):\n torify /Applications/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp &\n\nor \n cd /Applications/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/\n torify myapp &\n\n\nA: You're right. open launches the program in the background, so Torify doesn't work. The solution is to start the app by directly invoking its binary. Here's how:\ntorify /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp\n\n", "Q: How to import from OneNote on Windows to the Mac edition of OneNote? I have been working on Windows 7 with Microsoft OneNote 2010. I have a huge amount of work store in OneNote.\nI need to open those notebooks in OneNote running on OS X 10.9, Mavericks, which has been recently released. Is there a way to do so?\nAfter successfully importing, I plan to continue working on the Mac edition of OneNote.  \nIf OneNote on the Mac can not do this, are there any other applications on the Mac, like EverNote or Growly, which can import my work from Windows OneNote and let me continue on my Mac int the way I was doing in Windows?\n\nA: I exported my work OneNote file in Office 2010 this way. File tab -> Save As -> Notebook ->OneNote Package.\nOneNote on the Mac imports that notebook with no problems (or at least it did for me). And syncing with a (free) MS cloud account works great as well.\nIt seems to work largely the same as OneNote for Windows.\nAs for other applications. The only other program like this I tried was Evernote. But I was disappointed that it would not import styled text. So you lose all your formatting (tables, lists, pictures). The only way I found to import OneNote files into Evernote was to paste a screen shot of the page, hardly a good solution.\n\nA: Synchronising Notes Between OneNote Editions\nUpgrade to the latest OneNote on your Windows computer. This edition is compatible with the Mac edition of OneNote.\nOnce upgraded, you will be able to synchronise your files through Microsoft's cloud services. This will allow you to work on your OneNote files on both Mac or Windows.\nThe latest OneNote is free on both Mac and Windows.\nMac Alternatives to OneNote\nIf you do not like OneNote on the Mac, a number of Mac apps exist that import OneNote files. This discussion, can i transfer microsoft onenote to macbook, suggests GrowlyBird.\nIf you want specific alternative recommendations, ask a new software recommendation question mentioning where the free Mac OneNote does not meet your needs. Others with more exposure to alternatives should then be better able to help.\n\nA: Well, here is a one way to open a Windows OneNote notebook in the OSX version of Onenote.  I am particularly interested in opening a Notebook located on a Sharepoint server in a corporate environment and this met my needs.  This article describes the technique:\nhttp://www.benstegink.com/adding-sharepoint-onenote-notebook-onenote-mac/ \nBasically one must open the notebook in a windows machine, grab a link to an object in the notebook, send the link to the mac and then click on the link.\n\nA: I opened my old OneNote Notebook in Windows, Onenote 2010, and also opened a Notebook already stored in the OneDrive cloud (accessible by Mac).\nI then clicked on each tab of my old Notebook and copied it into the OneDrive cloud Notebook.  I clicked on Sync in the Windows version and then everyone was updated.  I could then abandon the Windows version and just use the cloud version via Mac.\n\nA: This worked for me: From the Windows OneNote (v2010 for me), sync your files to MS's cloud drive service.  Then open the Notebooks from the Mac client.  \nThere is no way to import a notebook on the Mac version 15.8.\n\nA: I upgraded OneNote on Windows to the latest version. In the installation process, it says files of old version failed to convert, but that's fine. Once you're done with the installation, open the software where you can find the old OneNote files. Click on property of each notes, convert it to the  2013 version, sync it. Then go back to your Mac; now you can find those notes in the cloud.\n\nA: Don't worry about import/export. Make sure you are using the latest version possible on both platforms, and store the Windows OneNote files in the cloud (OneDrive). This will also allow you to access it using the web version. Then invite yourself to share this OneNote notebook with an email address from your Mac You should now be able to get at the content in OneNote on the Mac and edit/move it as required. \n", "Q: Apple Thunderbolt Display switching between two computers without manually disconnecting the cord? I have connected mac mini to ATD with the ATD's thunderbolt port on the back side using extra thunderbolt-thunderbolt cord, and I sometimes connect my macbook with the thunderbolt cable from ATD's.\nTo make screen active I have to disconnect one of the computers manually, what is pretty inconvinent.\nI know this answer of somebody on Apple store Q&A from 2011 but I would like make sure if somebody not invented somme hack for not doing the switch manually.\nUPDATE:\nsoftware solutions are much more apriciated over the hardware one.\n\nA: What you describe asks for a KVM switch. That would be a small box with 2-4 output ports (non-enterprise class) where you connect one monitor/TB/USB devices and as many computers as you have ports on the switch. Then you switch which one is active and uses screen.\nWhat it effectively does is actually disconnecting computers from the screen, but you don't have to pull the cable, just press a correct button.\nA nice feature with those is that you can also connect Windows/Linux PCs and be able to seamlessly switch between all of them.\nFor example: http://www.atlona.com/Atlona-2x1-Mini-DisplayPort-KVM-Switch.html (it allows to connect 2 mini DP to one screen and switch between them using buttons on the front) [I'm not associated with manufacturer nor the online store, just giving it as an example].\n", "Q: Can't mount a CIFS volume I'm trying to mount a remote volume with cifs.

I like that the Calendar now allows assigning a location to an entry which can then be opened in Maps.\nUnfortunately it appears to be confined to locations assigned to contacts - which make sense if you for instance need to meet at somebodys - but now I had the need to pinpoint a location on the map which I do not intuitively map to a contact (a cinema actually) and use that as the meeting location, and could not figure out how.\nThe search function in Maps found the cinema and allowed me to select it to see it on the map.  The pinhead was red and I could assign it to a contact, but not to a calendar entry.\nIs this doable, and if so, how?\n\nA: Tap the pinhead, click SHARE, click COPY TO CLIPBOARD, paste into location. It works for me, some may think too many steps, but it's okay!\n", "Q: FaceTime contact Does anyone know why a FaceTime contact would show an incorrect facebook name?  When I FaceTime my friend a totally different name comes up under the Facebook contact. \n\nA: When you make a FaceTime call, the only identifying information you send is what you have got set in Settings > FaceTime > Caller ID, which will essentially be either an email address as associated with your AppleID, or potentially (in the case of iPhones not so much iPads) your phone number.\nWhen this information hits the recipient, it's down to their machine to extrapolate any further contact information by looking for a matching entry in their local address book, and then pulling a real contact name to replace the email address or phone number.  If nothing is present, the Caller ID is passed through as is.  If it finds a match, if displays that match.  If it finds multiple matches, then you should get a slightly cryptic looking message that says along the lines of \"Bill Gates or 2 others calling\" etc.\nIn short, if they are seeing a weird name, it's because they have said weird name against your Caller ID in their local address book.  They should search for it to fix it.  My guess is that Facebook contacts syncing has gone weird.\n", "Q: Finder crashing about once a minute: Segmentation Fault I just had to send my MacBook Pro in for a logic board replacement.

Is there a workaround for this or can another model be recommend the runs on OS X Mavericks?\n\nA: From the Alfa web site (no direct link to FAQ entry available):\n\nQ: Does AWUS036H has driver for Mac Lion?\nThe AWUS036H works on 32-bit Mac only. If your Mac system is running on 32-bit CPU and you just upgrade the Mac OS to latest version then your AWUS036H is still compatible to it. However, if you just purchased Mac system with 10.6.8 or later version who is running on 64-bit Mac system then you have to boot your computer into 32-bit in order to run the application with device. And you can find the installation guide through our blog @ http://alfanetworkinc.blogspot.com/2011/08/install-awus036h-onto-mac-os-107.html\nTo identify whether your Mac system is running in 64-bit or not, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3770\nIf you like to use wifi adapter with default 64-bit Mac system then we’ll suggest following models -  AWUS036NH, AWUS036NEH, AWUS051NH, AWUS036NHR and AWUS036NHV.\n\n\nA: You can reboot the system into 32 bit mode by pressing 3 and 2 during reboot, or by passing \nsystemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386\n\nto the command line as root. The former option works until the next reboot. The latter one is persistent.\n\nA: Mavericks only runs in 64bit mode. You can run KISMAC in 32bit by setting the \"Get Info\" checkbox. However, the USB driver for the Alpha is only for 32bit mode. Looks like the Alpha USB driver will have to be re-written to support 64bit.

Its contents date back at least 10 years. I have been asked to find a needle in this hay stack, and I have some guesses as to that needle's name. But I don't know its name for certain. I want to use a single find command in the Terminal to search for alternate names. And I want to include a second set: possible file extensions. In pseudocode, here's what I mean: find [in a given directory] [files and folders whose name matches (*guess1* OR *guess2*) AND whose name matches (*.extension1 OR *.extension2)]. How should I express this in the Terminal?\n\nA: You can do this using ls and grep with regular expressions\nls | grep -E \"(guess1|guess2)(\\.extension1|\\.extension2)\"\n\nOr if you need to recursively look into folders:\nls -R | grep -E \"(guess1|guess2)(\\.extension1|\\.extension2)\"\n\n\nA: Use the command\nfind /dir/to/search \\( -iname '*guess1*' -o -iname '*guess2*' \\) \\\n                    \\( -iname '*.extension1' -o -iname '*.extension2' \\)\n\nfind works recursively.  Use -maxdepth 1 to make it non-recursive.\n-iname does a case-insensitive filename match.\nArguments are implicitly joined by AND, but you can use -o to make it OR.  Parentheses have to be escaped with a backslash to protect them from the shell.\n(It could be written all on one line; here I've broken the lines using \\return for readability.)\n\nA: find is slow. grep and other text search tools are much faster. Unless you think you're going to find the needle in the haystack with the first shot, you're probably better off doing a find into a temporary file, e.g. find . -print > /tmp/find.out, and then searching in that file for file names that meet your search criteria.\n\nA: If the volume is indexed by Spotlight, then use mdfind for fastest results.\nmdfind -onlyin /dir/to/search '(kMDItemFSName==*guess1* || kMDItemFSName==*guess2*)' \\\n                     '&& (kMDItemFSName=*.extension1 || kMDItemFSName=*.extension2)'\n\n", "Q: Can't connect to internet on Wi-Fi since update to iOS 7.1.1 I recently updated to iOS 7.1.1 on my iPhone 5 and for the first couple of days everything was fine.

I've reset my network settings but that doesn't work, or switching the Wi-Fi on and off or switching the phone on and off. My 3G works fine.\n\nA: I had the same EXACT problem when I upgraded my iPhone 4S to iOS 7. I had no wi-fi. I never got it to work, except, if I did the \"freezer\" trick with my phone, sometimes it would work for a little bit. This makes me believe it has to do with power use and heat.\nI kept meaning to take it to the Apple Store to make them do something about it, but never got around to it. Then, when the latest iOS update came out, a couple days later, my phone started working fine again, and it has been ever since.\nI think there is definitely something crazy going on with the power saving algorithms Apple uses. Did you get your iPhone 5 when it first came out? My iPhone 4s was one of the first ones. I stink the hardware changes during the production cycle, and sometimes us early adopters get left out when they start tweaking things.\n", "Q: Does using albums to combine events keep the events intact? If I use albums in iPhoto to combine events for a slideshow will the album keep each event intact and in order rather than combining pictures by date or some other hierarchy?\n\nA: Albums don't affect the contents of an event in any way, so your events will remain exactly how you left them.\n", "Q: Avoiding all apps reopening when OS X crashes Sometimes my computer will crash and restart due to unknown errors. It usually happens when I'm working on something so a few apps are open. OS X has this annoying feature where it tries to reopen all apps when you restart. You can disable it when manually restarting, but it still does it if the computer restarts after a crash.\nI think this feature was built to save time, but all it does is waste more time than it's worth, because whenever the computer restarts from a crash I usually just restart it once more (this time with \"Reopen apps\" disabled) just to get to a workable state. The problem is it'll keep spawning apps and preventing the restart from happening.\nDisabling this feature would prevent me having to restart after a crash altogether. Is there a way to stop OS X from doing this?\n\nA: I found @babca's approach works well, but on macOS Catalina for me it was slightly different. I had two com.apple.loginwindow.*.plist files in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ and they were not plain text - com.apple.loginwindow.AB6XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXX5291.plist and com.apple.loginwindow.111XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXAC43.plist.\nSo I did the following two steps for each file:\nOpened (⌘-O) each Finder into XCode (the default I think in Catalina), removed all the entries under TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin, and saved the file.\n\nGot Info (⌘-I) for each in Finder then check Locked checkbox. Note the preview box shows an empty <array/> inside TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin.\n\nTo undo this change, repeat just the last step for each file but uncheck the Locked checkbox.\n\nA: I introduce a different solution to satisfy a few additional requirements of my own that make it more versatile. The requirements are:\n\n*\n\n*It must be from the command line so I can copy and paste rather than clumsily click through a UI.\n\n*It must be something that can be put in a for loop so I can modify every user on a machine. (DevOps anyone?) Additionally the code should still be able to stand alone, not requiring a for loop, so an end user can run it themselves for themselves.\n\n*It must be able to handle the home directory being in a non-standard location.\n\nWith the help of code located here, I came up with the following, which works in sh and bash on Catalina and Big Sur at minimum...\n# set user name, machine uuid, and home dir\nsomeUser=$(stat -f%Su /dev/console)\nmachineUUID=$(ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice | awk -F'\"' '/IOPlatformUUID/{print $4}')\nhomeDir=$(dscacheutil -q user -a name ${someUser} | grep 'dir:' | awk '{print $2}')\n\n# delete the plist array\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Delete :TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin' ${homeDir}/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.${machineUUID}.plist\n\n# make the file readonly\nchflags uimmutable ${homeDir}/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.${machineUUID}.plist\n\n\nA: Permanently prevent macOS High Sierra from reopening apps after a restart\nWorks in macOS El Capitan, Yosemite, Sierra, High Sierra.\nSolution: deny OS X access to the file it uses to store your session state.\nIt prevents reopening apps even after reboot/shutdown from Terminal, from AppleScript, and system crash.\nGUI method\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Cmd+Shift+G (Go to folder)\n\n*Copypaste ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ and confirm\n\n*Find the file starting with com.apple.loginwindow\n\n*Doubleclick (opens in TextEdit)\n\n*Remove all content and save the empty file.

Also, I do not have cloud set up so this is kind of creeping me out lol.  We have VERY different musical tastes and I'd love for these songs to stop randomly popping up in my iTunes (they are really inappropriate).\n\nA: Yes! You can deauthorize any of the computers or devices authorized for your iTunes account. If you have access to a computer, the easiest thing to do is to open iTunes and go to Store -> View Account in the menus. (That is on my mac iTunes, it might be slightly different on Windows.)\nIn your Apple ID summary, you can see Computer Authorizations and Deauthorize All (you can easily reauthorize your own computers after this, since you have the password -- which you might want to change!)

When it encounters a message that is being sent to mac@email.com, I'd like it to redirect it to email@gmail.com, where the \"From\" field is NOT mac@email.com, but rather is the \"From\" field on the original email that was sent to mac@email.com.\nE.g., I'm Joe Schmo and I send an email from joeschmo@joe.com to mac@email.com. Then the Apple Script runs and redirects that email to send it to email@gmail.com with the From tag as joeschmo@joe.com\nI am planning on setting up a rule in my Mail app that runs this apple script when it encounters a message that is being sent to mac@email.com.\nNote: the emails in this example are fake.\n\nA: You should be able to use the \"Redirect\" option, under the Message menu. Actually, if I'm reading your question right, you should be able to do this entirely through a rule, with no Applescript needed. \nBuilding from \"How to batch forward messages from Mail.app\", if you make a rule that targets emails sent to mac@email.com, just say \"Redirect Message\" to \"email@gmail.com\".\nExample: \nMake sense?\n\nA: Well, there is no definitive answer because it depends on your email provider.\nNormally an email provider will refuse an email with a FROM: field that not matches with the logged-in user. And on the other hand: What you want is a job for your email provider - he could give you the possibility to forward a mail with a preserving FROM: field.\nI can´t give you an applescript because I think you won´t will use it, because of a refusing email provider.\nIf you want to test the whole thing please you could do this via telnet.\n", "Q: New mac - installed tmux but can't use mouse in for pane switching I have the required setw / setg setting for mouse in my .tmux.conf but they aren't working.\nI've done tmux source-file .tmux.conf\nI can use tmux and split windows with my remapped keys and other settings that I have such as remapping the power key ARE working.\n\nA: Turned out I was using tmux with the basic mac terminal app.\nIt mostly worked but a few things didn't.  The mouse functionality is an example.\nThe answer was that I needed to download and use iterm2 as the actual terminal app to use tmux with.\nOnce I did this my tmux mouse settings worked fine with it.\n", "Q: Adding hosts entry to iOS in absence of DNS I am working with an application where my iPhone needs to see my laptop on the network under its host name and not the IP address because the SSL certificate works with the name only.  At the office, I resolved it by adding a DNS entry mapping my host to my IP and it works.  But today I am WFH on my home network which does not have a DNS server capability.\nI was wondering if I can somehow edit some hosts file on the iPhone (or some setting or something equivalent) so that the iPhone can see the laptop under its name.  They are both on the same network and can reach each other via IP but the network has no DNS.\nI also came upon this related material.  Here are my pertinent settings:\n>hostname\nmy-mac.local\n>scutil --get ComputerName\nmy-mac\n>scutil --get HostName\nHostName: not set\n>scutil --get LocalHostName\nmy-mac\n\n\nA: You can edit the hosts file on the iOS device if the device is jailbroken.\nThe hosts file can be found in the same place as on OS X: /etc/hosts. It works exactly the same as the hosts file on OS X.\nSet the hostname of your OS X machine using:\nsudo scutil --set HostName your-hostname\n\n", "Q: How do I find my purchased OS X 10.9.2 which was accidentally deleted from App Store? I have accidentally deleted my copy of OS X Mavericks 10.9.2 from the App Store in the  purchased section under my account.\nIs there any way I can get it back again without paying for a second time?\n\nA: You can´t really delete your purchases - but you could hide purchases.\nApple has a Support file for this case.\nYou have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Mac App Store.\n\n*Choose Store > Sign In, then enter your Apple ID and password.\n\n*Choose Store > View My Account.\n\n*Click on View Hidden Purchases from the Account Information page. \n\n*From the Hidden Purchases page, locate the app you would like to unhide.\n\n*Click the Unhide button.\n\n", "Q: Can't connect to SMB share between two current 10.9.x machines not connected to the internet In two instances I have have a number of Mac Minis and iMacs that were not connected to the Internet but a local isolated LAN have their SMB:// shares refuse to connect, though they worked days or weeks before with no configuration changes.\nAfter some testing I found that AFP:// and CIFS:// connections still worked using the same username and password as the non working SMB connections.\nSince 10.9.x uses SMB by default now I wanted to figure out what was causing the issue instead of switching to AFP or CIFS as many have suggested.\n\nA: Answering my own question since I had not seen this specific question answered.\nAfter some log searching I finally found out that the issue was because the time on one of the machines was drifting causing it to become more than 5 minutes off from the computer it was connecting to and the server (computer connecting to) was displaying this log entry:\n<date> <time> kdc[80]: Too large time skew, client time <time> is out by 356 > 300 seconds -- <user>@LKDC:<SHA1>\n\nAfter finding this log entry I noticed and corrected the local time on the machines and the SMB connection via finder worked right away as expected.\nThe moral of this story is don't trust the Mac internal time without NTP backup; either via the Internet or a local NTP server.\n", "Q: How to add multiple effects in iMovie 10 (Mavericks) I want to add a black and white as well as a film grain effect to the same video in iMovie 10. I can't see any way to do this as applying one effect removes the other. Does anyone know how to do this? Thanks.\n\nA: Not in iMovie 10.0.5, unless you open up a separate project, drag the clip in there, apply the 1st effect, export it, then drag the exported clip it into your main project or 2nd project (if 3 effects or more effects are needed), then add a second (or final effect).\n\nA: You can try applying one effect first and then by exporting and re-importing you can apply the second effect.\n\nA: Click on the video clip, then go to the color palette and bring it all the way down, it will make the clip black and white. Then go in to the effects and add the aged film. \n", "Q: How do I transfer the cellular service from one iPad to another? I have a first-generation iPad mini with Verizon LTE service and I’m replacing it with a second-generation mini. What do I need to do to “transfer” the cellular service from the one to the other? (In other words, I want the new device to seamlessly replace the old one as far as the carrier is concerned.)\nIs it a simple matter of moving the old SIM card to the new device, or do I need to get the carrier involved?\n\nA: I've always involved the carrier, but I don't know if you have to involve VZW in the switch.\nIf you have a shared data plan, then you will certainly want to get them involved to ensure you don't make a stand alone plan when the old SIM hits the new device. I've had no issues with exchanging a device and not had to pay the fee for enrolling the new device since it simply replaced the old one.\nIf you are on a month to month plan and don't mind re-paying the activation charge, you could simply set up the new device and let the old device's plan expire.\nMuch depends on if you use the device to set up the account or want to have verizon enter the details into their system as the different types of accounts have different manners of adding the new device to the plan.\n", "Q: Where does SFTPD log to?

I have a hand-me-down iPhone 4S from my wife running iOS 6.1.3. I have deleted the Facebook app. However other apps (like Instagram) still think my wife's Facebook account is linked to the phone and log in using her account.\nIn the iPhone's Settings app, there is still a Facebook subsection which lists my wife's account. There is a big red button to delete the account. This seems like the thing to do. But before I do, I want to confirm that doing so will only delete the account from this iPhone, NOT her actual Facebook account, which she naturally still wants to access from the web, her new phone, etc.\nSo -- safe to hit the big red button in this case?\n\nA: It only deletes from the phone. It will not delete the Facebook account from Facebook.\n", "Q: Wrong iCloud email How do I change my iCloud account email? I use a different email for iCloud than iTunes for several reasons and I accidentally put in the wrong email for my iCloud and it's not allowing me to change the email, only the password. I don't want to delete anything else on my phone, I just want to change the email. \n\nA: If you log out of the iCloud account (using the big Delete Account button at the bottom of Settings > iCloud), it will only delete the things that came from that iCloud account. Things like contacts, mail, calendars, reminders, etc. \nIt won't delete music, apps, or iMessages.

I am looking to purchase a refurbished Macbook Air from Apple's refurbished store. \nWhen comparing the models there are two I am looking at. The difference between the two is slight but one of the difference is the processor. \nOne has a processor of 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.8GHz) while the other has a 1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.6GHz).\nI am experienced with PCs but not Macs. The price is nearly identical ($20 dollar difference.)\nThe newer model is 1.3Ghz.\nAm I going to see a big difference in speed between the two Macs?\n\nA: 1.3 GHz seems to be mid-2013 Haswell based machine with Intel HD 5000 graphics, the other one is probably mid-2012 Ivy-bridge one with Intel HD 4000.\n\n\n*\n\n*Haswell based CPU is about 5-10% faster than Ivy Bridge according to various benchmarks (so, all in all it should be comparable in terms of pure speed, but read further)\n\n*Haswell chips make SSD drives run faster\n\n*Intel HD 5000 is much better than 4000 (and that will give most significant boost to overall performance IMHO)\n\n\nSo, if all other specs are the same, I'd go for 1.3 Haswell one, the problem is that you never know what you'll get when buying refurbished machine.\n\nA: You mention newer is 1.3 GHz, but you should look at little closer at the specific processor powering the two Macbook Airs (MBA). You can visit EveryMac and based on the year of the two MBAs determine the processor family.\nIf you find that the 1.3 GHz process is from the Haswell family while the 1.8 Ghz is from the previous family/generation, you're better of going with the Haswell chip which will yield better performance and power management yielding better battery life from the MBA.\n", "Q: After Mavericks upgrade Chrome font is terrible I just upgrade to Mavericks and had some issues.

I am considering purchasing a new MacBook Air (early 2014 edition). I'd like to drive two external monitors from the laptop.\nBased on my reading the 2013 Air only supported Thunderbolt 1 and therefore DisplayPort 1.1. With the semi-model-refresh that occurred in early 2014 was the Thunderbolt controller updated to version 2 and therefore DisplayPort 1.2?\n\nA: No, The Early 2014 MacBook Air has Thunderbolt 1 and therefore DisplayPort 1.1.\nSource : Apple Support Page\n\nA: Mid-2012 and later MacBook Airs do support two Thunderbolt displays (see this document from Apple), but if you're not using Apple displays it's a bit more complicated. \nYou'll need to either invest in something like this Mini DisplayPort to dual HDMI adapter, a Matrox DualHead2Go or a DisplayLink USB adapter (those do have issues with newer Macs and Mavericks though, I believe).\n\nA: This french article says yes Thunderbolt 2 but : \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple markets it as a TB2. \n\n*But the processor has only 6 PCIe lines : \n\n*\n\n*1 for the webcam\n\n*1 for the wifi \n\n*2 for the SSD\n\n\n\nLeaving only 2 PCIe lines for the thunderbolt which is barely enough for the TB 1 specs (in terms of bandwidth). \n", "Q: iPhone 5 flashlight strength After having had my bag stolen, I am putting together a new EDC kit, and am wanting to include a flashlight.

Does anyone know how powerful the one on the iPhone 5 is, measured in Lumen?\n\nA: My apologies for not being able to give you a 100% answer. But I did find a informative post about the LED strength of an iPhone 4 (should be the same for the 5 - not the 5S).\n\nUsing a combination of direct and reflection lux meter readings, and comparing the same readings to lights of known lumen output, I'd roughly estimate the iPhone 4 LED is about 5 to 10 lumens in normal continuous use.\nIt briefly gets significantly brighter when used as a camera flash, but it's too brief to measure with my lux meter.

Word for Windows either uses Adobe's PDF creator or its own (depending on which version of Word for Windows you're using), which is why the functionality is different between the two applications.  OS X's built-in PDF creator doesn't do what you want.\nIf you have a license for Adobe Acrobat (not Acrobat Reader, but the full Acrobat), you can use Adobe's PDF creator.  \nAnother option which others have reported having success with (and which doesn't require an expensive Acrobat license) is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your Word document to your computer.\n\n*Upload your Word document to Google Drive.

I am able to do so with any drives on the server (internal or external), but the server application doesn't seem to recognize any drives connected via the Airport Extreme. \nIs there any way to do this, or is my only option to move the drive to the server instead of the Airport Extreme?\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but responding anyway in case people are googling for an answer still.  You can access your Airport Extreme Shared Disk through a VPN from outside the network, all WITHOUT checking \"Share disks over WAN\".  Here is hows it's done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure your VPN server to also push the routes for your home network.  Below is a sample from my macbook routing table once connected to the VPN:\n\n\n\nInternet: \nDestination        Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire\ndefault            172.20.10.1        UGSc          15        2     en0\n10.0.1/24          10.2.1.5           UGSc           0        0     utun1\n\nAs you can see, the home network traffic gets tunneled through the VPN.\n\n\n*Next step is to \"Connect to server...\" in Finder.  You can click on \"GO\" in the top menu bar to get there, or hit Command-K.  Once there you need to provide the url to the file share.  In the case of the Airport Extreme the url should look like this: \nafp://10.0.1.1/NAME_OF_SHARE \nOR\nsmb://10.0.1.1/NAME_OF_SHARE \n\n(replace NAME_OF_SHARE with your shared name, mine is Raid5 so the url looks like this: afp://10.0.1.1/Raid5)\n\n*For the username and password, provide the credentials as you normally would connect.  For cases where a disk password is used instead of accounts, then the username will be \"root\", and the password will be the disk password.\n\n*All set, the share will be mounted as normal.\n**NOTE:  These instructions assume you are on a MAC.  \n", "Q: Locked out of iPhone.

I have a mid-2012 Macbook Pro 13, 2.5 GHZ, non-retina, with 4 GB RAM, running Mavericks. I occasionally get the swirling beach ball when running various applications, such as XCode and iPhoto (not necessarily at the same time), and the overall speed of the computer isn't impressive.  However, when I look at my memory pressure, it is almost always in the green.  The virtual memory is in the 5 GB - 6 GB range, for what it's worth.  Will upgrading the RAM to 8 GB help the overall speed of the machine, or does the memory pressure tell me everything is fine concerning RAM?\n\nA: It might be different depending on what type of app you are using, but generally speaking, it sure is beneficial to update from 4 GB to 8 GB since 4 GB is not a lot for a Mac and you are using Xcode.\nThe iPhoto app might not change much, because it has to load lots of photos, its latency depends more on the disk instead of the memory.\nThe value of virtual memory might not be very informative, you should look more at swap used right below virtual memory, this is the memory that is actually stored on the disk since the physical memory is not enough.\nIf you see that swap used is often more than zero, your priority should be absolutely to change for 8 GB memory. Otherwise, installing a SSD might be a better choice though that's more expensive...\nedit 1:\nGenerally speaking, I would recommend upgrading the memory over upgrading to a SSD.\nA SSD affects only the loading speed of things, that is, the time that it takes for the computer starts up or for an app to load itself. But the size of memory affects the speed of apps when you are opening lots of them. \nOn the Mac, the concept is switching more and more to holding the app inactive in the background instead of closing them completely, that enables the apps to respond quickly since we don't have to load them again from disk. \nDespite Apple's memory compression technology, opening lots of apps still takes a considerable amount of memory, so upgrading the memory prevents the mac to swap some memory to disk, and makes the mac faster when you have lots of apps in the background.\n\nA: You would notice the spinning ball a lot less. Having more memory wont necessarily increase the speed of your computer, but it will help with running multiple applications at the same time.\nCurrently you may be experiencing \"slowness\" because your computer memory has reached the limit. You are then forced to wait for memory to free up, hence the swirling ball.\nIncreasing the amount of memory, would prolong the swirling ball, until 8gb of memory are full.\n\nA: Took my mid-2011 MBP 15\" from 4 to 16 gigs RAM for the same reasons. Definitely helped, but agree with previous poster, if you want a major speed increase, go with 16 gigs and an SSD. The spinning hard drive is really the bottleneck in the system. \n\nA: Ram is not your issue.  Probably permissions issues, rogue preference files, or some rogue application/process causing the slowdowns.\nBeachballs have nothing to do with ram.  It means, for some reason, the application isn't responding.  This is usually because of high CPU utilization (faces in iPhoto comes to mind) or an application blocking the main thread.\nI also use Xcode, iPhoto and Aperture... on a 2008 Macbook Pro with 4 gigs of ram.  The only time i've seen massive beach balling everywhere was upgrading from snow leopard to lion (instead of a clean install).\nBefore buying anything, i'd go grab Onyx http://www.onyxmac.com and see if it cleans up your problems.  Also if you do not have at least a 7200rpm drive, i'd upgrade that before the ram Preferably to an SSD.  OS X is pretty IO hungry for things that aren't cached.  Eventually you'll need at least 8 gigs.    That would help a lot if you have a large iPhoto library.\n", "Q: Updating iOS always bricks my iPad I have been having terrible problems in uploading my iPad Mini 2 of late.  The upgrade to 7.1 and 7.1.1 have both left my iPad in \"recovery mode\" - bricked until connected to iTunes where it forces me to reset all my settings and lose all my data.  \nI had assumed that this was a one off but as it's now happened two upgrades running I'd love to know what's happening in order to fix it for next time - I'm left scared to update!\nThe upgrade had been downloaded over wifi automatically and the iPad had full charge at the start.  The verifying bubble was then displayed, before the iPad restarted and showed only the connect to iTunes logo.\n\nThis is still the case with versions up to 9.3.1 - every iOS update that is applied over the air (downloaded straight to my device) bricks it whilst tethered updates do not.  Does anyone have an idea what is going on?\n\nThe situation has progressively got worse for me in that now even tethered updates brick the iPad briefly.  I also tried to do a factory reset without upgrading and had the same problem!  The iTunes updates just keep failing with unknown errors and eventually the device runs out of charge, at which point turning it on again brings the device out of it's bricked state.  I'm guessing at this point this is likely to be a hardware error?\n\nA: Firmware umbrella may be able to kick the device out of recovery mode after the upgrade:\nhttp://blog.firmwareumbrella.com/\nAlternately, try to do the upgrade through iTunes as opposed to OTA.\n\nA: I stopped doing OTA upgrades on ipad2 and use only tethered because of same issue....no problems now....always backup to computer and never losses data\n", "Q: After downloading file installer process runs and uses all memory When I download a file from the internet a process starts with name \"installer\" and uses all the available memory until my Mac crashes.\nIt's not related to the browser — I tested with Chrome and Safari.\nThe only solution I have is to kill the process from Terminal.\nWhat is installer?

I'm hoping some of you might have suggestions for me as to possible causes and solutions?\n\nA: You do know that RAID 0 is only striping and not only provides no redundancy, but increases the risk of data loss as the failure of any single drive can mean the loss of the entire storage pool? RAID 0 is only for increasing read and write speeds, for example for video editing.\nYou need at least RAID 1 or 5 for redundancy.\nThat being said, if you're losing data, one of the drives may be bad our you have a controller problem.

The application stores the application preferences using the java.util.prefs library. Is there a way I can delete java's stored preferences in Mac? (E.g., in linux, I would just delete the ~/.java folder)\n\nA: From Apple Developer Connection:\n\nThe preferences files generated by the Preferences API are named com.apple.java.util.prefs.

I saw some cable for around $100 with USB+TB to VGA, would that improve the picture?\n\nA: Generally amount of monitors connected does not have that much influence on cpu performance. Also, i7 CPUs shine most where tasks are prepared to use multiple CPUs/cores (code compiling, audio, video, graphics editing, rendering). Thus I don't think you should consider CPU update because of amount of monitors you want to connect.\nFor normal usage andeven gaming I'd just choose the best i5 you can get and get better SSD or more ram instead.\nAs for the cables - you will have 2 TB ports and HDMI - if you want to leave one TB free maybe use those? So, if any of the mentionend monitors has Display Port (DP) you would need 1 mini DP/DP and one HDMIcable.\nI think you can also get TB hub, that will allow you to use one TB to connect both screens, but I haven't tested it.\n", "Q: Make F8 work as F8 on MacBook Pro I would like to make F8 key on my MacBook Pro to work as an F8 key, not Play/Pause key, without having to press fn key at the same button.\nHow do I configure Mac OS X (Mavericks) to work that way?\n\nA: This function can be set up by going to System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard and enabling Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys.\n\n\nA: You can use FunctionFlip which can 'flip' certain function keys instead of changing all keys.\n\nFunctionFlip individually controls your MacBook or MacBook Pro's function keys, turning special keys back to regular F-keys, or vice-versa.\n\n\n\nFunctionFlip's purpose is simply to disable the special features — rewind, play, mute, etc. — on the function keys. For example, if you \"flip\" F7, F8, and F9, those keys — only those keys — will revert back to normal F keys. Press the fn key with the special key to get the special function back. That is, the \"special\" and \"normal\" functions are flipped.\n\n\nYou can also use KeyRemap4MacBook with a private.xml such as this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>F8 as Function</name>\n    <identifier>F8asFunction</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_MUSIC_PLAY, KeyCode::F8</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F4, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_MUSIC_PLAY</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n", "Q: How should I restore a backup of my user account from a .dmg?

Storing the files on the iPhone memory seems to cause LESS trouble since I always have a security backup every time I connect my iPhone to iTunes to make a backup on my hardisk.\nThat's a really DISAPPOINTING experience!\nPS: And strangely, I wasn't even able to open some files stored on iCloud. Only the first file worked. I had to install three times Garageband from the app store to make it working. A really FRUSTRATING experience!\n", "Q: How can I call/message on iPad air with SIM? I have purchased an iPad Air with cellular but I cannot send and receive messages.\nThe name of the SIM company has appeared and I have connected it with my router. There is no icon for calling either, just an icon for messages.\n\nA: You can't without jailbreaking. The SIM for the iPad air is for the data network only.

Switching the cable let me connect my Android device without further problems.\n\nA: My solution strictly involved replacing the cable. I found the original cable for the Nexus 5 and the problem cleared. Two other cabled failed to activate the program in my macbook air.\n", "Q: How can I change this name? This xue drives me crazy, I don't know where it come from, how can I change it?\n\n\nA: It's the current user's home directory. It should correspond to the currently logged in user (shown in System Preferences > System > Accounts). The name xue is the short name for the currently logged-in user.\nIf it's on your Mac and it isn't you and you don't recognise it, then you'd have to wonder who has an account on your Mac that you don't know about. Did you buy it secondhand maybe?\nYou can rename user accounts - see Apple's support website for more info.\n\nA: That is your home folder.

I have OS X Mavericks and I want to try to learn Objective-C(++). For this, I need to install the gobjc compiler, how do it (I've tried to install gobjc from sources but it's still not present)?\n\nA: The most straightforward way to install an Objective-C compiler is by installing Xcode (which is available free from the App Store). It gives you both the IDE and the command-line compilers (there's an option inside Xcode to install the latter). If you don't want to install the IDE, you can install the command-line tools only using xcode-select --install. \nOnce you have the command-line tools installed, you can use them to bootstrap GCC if you'd prefer to use that.\n", "Q: Switching to an open application via BetterTouchTool (making it active) Is it possible to switch TO an open application via keyboard shortcut in BetterTouchTool?\nCurrently I’m using a predefined action “Open Application” instead but it’s not quite the same as I don’t want to switch to the app. if it hasn’t been opened yet.\n\nA: A free solution: Use BetterTouchTool to trigger an applescript similar to the following, which will activate Safari if it's running, and do nothing if it's not:\nif application \"Safari\" is running then\n    tell application \"Safari\" to activate\nend if\n\nA not free solution: Tie a BetterTouchTool trigger to a Keyboard Maestro macro, which will give you plenty of control over when the application gets activated.

With QFix installed, backup became much faster. I/O error still happened twice, but at least no more stuck in the middle of backing up (since QFix, done full backup from the scratch: 27GB).\n\nA: To summarize how I worked around the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*made sure the problem only exists for Mavericks: made sure that another Mac (pre-Mavericks) still backs up to QNAP NAS seamlessly \n\n*made sure that problem is only related to QNAP NAS and Mavericks together, not to Mavericks alone. For this, performed back up to external HDD\n\n*\n\n*when external HDD backup got stuck with progress bar frozen, Standby-Resume of Mac helped to \"unfreeze\" Time Machine most of the time\n\n\n*to achieve first successful backup with NAS, I first excluded every folder that is on \"Macintosh HD\": Time Machine Preferences > Options > Exclude these from backups > +. Having minimal successful backup, I added folder by folder, from smallest ones (all <1MB, then all <1GB, then one by one more and more large, largest in the end.\n\n*\n\n*when backup stopped itself long before the estimated time, it turned out that it actually copied the part last displayed on progress bar. The next time you invoke Back Up Now, the total amount of files to back up becomes smaller by the amount reached previous time.\n\n\n*for QNAP NAS, installed QFix (reboot OS X before invoking new backups). QFix seriously improved copying speed and made the speed consistent, plus resolved \"frozen progress\" problem at least for a full backup from the scratch.\n\n\nStill, the problems left for Apple and QNAP to solve are:\n\n\n*\n\n*progress bar which frequently gets frozen in the middle of copying\n\n*stuck \"Preparing backup...\" after QFix before OS X reboot\n\n*backing up stopping itself in the middle of copying, and/or \"I/O error\" which forces backup progress to stop\n\n", "Q: How can I tell if \"find my iPhone\" has been used We have several apple devices at home.

I took the magnet off quickly, after realizing what I had done, but it seems I was too late! \nThe laptop started making a weird sound so I switched it off, thinking it was the best thing to do. After a minute or two, I turned on the laptop again and it started up but with a folder with a question mark in the middle of the screen. I turned it off and tried again, but the same image came up.\nI'm almost certain I've wiped it, but obviously I'm no genius. Is there any way to fix it without taking the laptop to Apple?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the magnet damaged the data on internal hard disk, which is located near the trackpad inside your MacBook Pro. Data on standard Hard Disks is stored on the disk using patterns of magnetization.\nYou will have to erase and restore from a backup if you have one.\n\nA: Do you need to take it into Apple? \nNot necessarily.  This is something you can do at home as long as you have installation media or a Time Machine backup.\nWhen you see the screen below (any Mac computer, not just the iMac), it means that your computer cannot find the operating system (macOS) from which to boot.    This can happen for any number or reasons like the OP putting a magnet on the HDD and basically erasing it or a drive failure (which affects SSDs as well) to good old fashioned user error.\n\nProvided that you have a working drive, you can reinstall your OS.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Recovery.  ⌘ Command R.

I needed to connect my mac to the monitor so I decided to go for an HDMI to DVI cable since it was cheaper than the Mini Display Port one. \nWhen I plugged my mac into the monitor, the mac's screen flashed and the discrete gpu was activated, which would seem to indicate that it is attached to an external monitor. However, the monitor does not display an image and in a few seconds says that it is \"entering power save mode\" (when nothing is connected it does not display this, indicating that it detects that something is connected). \nI tried using boot camp to see if that would help but there was no difference.

I then tried to do it manually (after checking the \"manage music and videos manually\" option in the summary) but this gave the same result. I even tried another album, which doesn't work as well. Both albums come from CDs and do play normally in iTunes. (In fact, I'm listening to one right now.)\nI do not mind deleting all songs from my iPhone, since restoring that wouldn't take long, even manually (it's just one album right now), but future visitors might benefit more from your answer if it didn't require that.\nWhat I think to be the cause:\nI reinstalled the operating system on the computer with iTunes a while ago (see my previous questions for more info) and didn't want to restore from the Time Machine backup, since I had accumulated a lot of superfluous bytes, and the reinstallation seemed like a good opportunity to get rid of those. I restored my iTunes library by simply restoring only the ~/Music directory, which restored all my songs. But when I connected my iPhone to my computer it asked me if I trusted the iPhone (and the iPhone asked if I trusted the computer). I think my manual restoration of iTunes didn't include some files connected to managing devices with iTunes which causes this now.\n\nA: There could be several reasons for this as far as I can tell, but my solution, after hours of research was rebuilding the iTunes library.\nYou might be able to check if this will actually work by addig some new music to your library and then trying to sync it to your device.\nIf becomes available (black instead of gray in the Music section), then this might work for you.\nThe steps for rebuilding your library are pretty simple, described here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201561\nBasically: \n\n\n*\n\n*Close iTunes\n\n*Go to your iTunes Music folder\n\n*Move the itunes library xml to a different location (e.g. desktop)\n\n*Delete the .itl file (the actual library information)\n\n*Reopen iTunes and import the moved xml (Import Playlist)\n\n\nA: Make sure the iPhone and iTunes are both signed in and Authorized (iTunes 11 > Store > Authorize this Computer). What happens if you just drag and drop the album to the iPhone listing inside iTunes?\n\nA: reset the iPhone and re-import your music.\n\nA: It is possible that the iOS drivers required by your computer to correctly recognize the iPhone are misconfigured or that their installation is corrupt.\nI'd suggest fully uninstalling iTunes and its components from the computer and re-installing it. \nA computer restart after this procedure, and you should be fine. \nLet us know how it goes.\n\nA: I talked to Mac support because all the cd's I have put in my iTunes all of a sudden couldn't be played in my iPhone. they said that it's not possible anymore to add own cd in iPhone unless it is bought in iTunes Store. I WILL NEVER buy my music in iTunes Store period. I have bought the CD and as long as I do it for personal use I can't see the problem. He said that too many people are borrowing cd's from others and recording those so in Apples optic I am a criminal???? Normally one is innocent until proven guilty but not according to Apple. Companies like Apple are having way too much power and should be stripped from it or maybe we, the consumers should go back to PC to gain a certain level of freedom?\n", "Q: How do I change the color of my Dock on Mac I am digging deep into my Mac's files to try and find how to change the color of my mac's dock. I have been able to change little things like the separator, indicator light, trash can, finder icon, etc. But I cannot find the file where the color of the actual Dock is.\nI used this code to immediately go to the Dock folder\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources\nIf you want a picture please ask and I'll edit a good one so you get the idea.\n\nA: As far as I know, there's no image that you can change to change the background of the Dock. However, you can give the image to DockMod which will let you change the background.\n\n", "Q: How do I perform a factory reset of my iPhone? I am giving my iPhone to my daughter. How do I clear my information and set up hers? I want to make sure I do not lose any of my information from my accounts that I use on my current phone.\n\nA: Doing Erase all Content and Settings from Settings / General / Reset will do the trick.\nThis process will remove all settings and information from the device, letting you configure it from the very beginning, as if you had done a reinstall.\nThe process won't delete nor modify the iCloud's account data.\nBear in mind, then, that you should either have an iCloud or iTunes backup or be sure that every possible information synchronizable with iCloud is, indeed, synchronized. To do so you should go to Settings / iCloud and check what's enabled and what's not.\n", "Q: Didn't Apple use to provide USB stick with OS X on it? I'm quite new to the Apple Mac world, and I've been told that some of the older macs used to include a USB stick to boot the OSX Mountain Lion.\nI have a Macbook Pro with Mavericks, and there was no USB stick included. Did they discontinue this?\n\nA: Yes, The USB recovery drive shipped first with a MacBook Air and Lion was also sold as a full retail OS on USB write only format instead of the retail DVD/CD that used to be available for purchase.\nApple discontinued this practice a few years ago and has started distributing OS X via the App Store exclusively as a digital download. You can make a bootable version of the installer from the App Store version if you have a USB stick handy.\nThere's a free, AppleScript-based program called DiskMaker X that will help you build a bootable USB stick for Mavericks. You'll have to download the installer from the App Store first. Just cancel the installation after the download and Mavericks will remain in your Applications folder for DiskMaker X to find and use.\n\nA: Apple did discontinue the practice of including install media (USB or CD) with a new Mac. \nThis has happened because a recovery partition and internet recovery have made it unnecessary. \nA recovery partition should exist on the drive which can booted from by holding down Command+R when booting. \nAdditionally, Apple has also introduced Internet Recovery allows the computer to be booted from the internet even if no operating system or recovery partition exists on the drive (e.g., after the drive has been completely replaced). There are only a limited number of Macs and limited network configurations that Internet Recovery supports.\nDetails are here: About OS X Recovery\n\nA: Having just done this for my employees, I'll add to Ian C's great answer: \n - be sure to first check your Application's folder for any existing Maverick installer. There's probably not one, but if there is, delete it. Otherwise, the App Store will see that it's already there, and not download whatever latest version is on the App Store (no idea why it doesn't recognize that it's an earlier version). No biggie if you create a bootable USB stick from, say, 10.9.1 instead of 10.9.2, but this \"delete first!\" method will save you the time from having to do an upgrade after the installation.\n", "Q: Putting iPhone passcode into Xcode, so I wouldn't need to unlock my iPhone for every build? Is there a way that I could put my iPhone lock code into Xcode, so I wouldn't need to unlock my iPhone for every build?\nIt gets really frustrating that I need to physically unlock my iPhone before every build.\nI know for developing on android they allow you to put the device in dev mode, which restricts the device from sleeping.\n\nA: Could everyone please report this as a bug?\nAs it stands, you either put up with it, or much worse, turn off locking. Neither option is good.\nIf the iOS device is in developer mode, and connected to an active Xcode instance, Xcode should be able to keep the phone unlocked.\nThat way you not only can leave locking on, but it will re-lock the instant you disconnect.\n\nA: You can prevent the device from sleeping in Settings → General → Auto-Lock → Never. This means the device will stay unlocked and you won't need to unlock it. As I'm jailbroken, I have this set automatically when my device is connected to a computer with Xcode running, but changing this setting manually will also work fine.\nAlternatively, you can set Settings → Passcode → Require Passcode to a longer interval so that your passcode isn't required if you need to unlock it. Don't forget to reset this setting back to its original setting after you finish developing.\n\nA: This is a workaround trick.\nIn AppDelegate.swift add this code\nclass AppDelegate: UIApplicationDelegate {\n\nlet isDebug: Bool = {\n        var isDebug = false\n        func setDebug() -> Bool {\n            isDebug = true\n            return true\n        }\n        assert(setDebug())\n        return isDebug\n    }()\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n\n    // for development only\n    // to make iPhone screen always on when developing app. \n    // should be removed when app is released\n\n    if isDebug {\n        print(\"DEBUG MODE\")\n        UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true\n    }\n\n    return true\n  }\n\n}\n\n\nA: As far as I know this is not possible. The only possible solution, obviously, would be to disable the iPhone's passcode during your programming sessions. \n\nA: The real answer is you currently need to jailbreak to do this as @grgarside alluded to. \nUse Activator (install from Cydia if you don't already have it), and set the action for Anywhere -> Connected (Power) to the action that disables the Auto-Lock. Do the opposite (enable Auto-Lock) for Disconnected (Power).\n\nA: In Xcode 7.3 it seems that you only have to unlock your device on the first build. After that, your device stays unlocked until you unplug it or exit the app you're testing.\n", "Q: Disable \"Updates Ready to Install\" Apps from OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) have started to ask me to restart when there are updates ready to install. Is it possible to completely disable this notification?\nScreenshot of notification:\n\n\nA: To stop the notifications, go to System Preferences > App Store and disable 'check automatically for updates.' This will stop the notifications. This was from http://lifehacker.com/how-to-fix-os-x-mavericks-biggest-annoyances-1450220339\n", "Q: Is there a way to shut down, restart or log off without seeing the popup? I would like to know if there is a way to delete the popup shown when you are trying to shut down, restart or log off your Mac with version OS X 10.9 - What I want is that when I click on one of these buttons, the computer makes that action without asking for a confirmation and the countdown of 1 minute.\nI know you can use Alt+Shut down/Restart/Log off but I would like to know if there is a direct way to deactivate that popup via Terminal or something else.\n\nA: There are a few methods to shutdown without confirmation (this will not remove the confirmation from the original method):\n\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal: shutdown -h now, but this force quits all applications\n\n*Make an Applescript and save it as 'Application,' save it somewhere easily accessible, but not prone to accidental clicks: \n\non run\n  do shell script \"shutdown -h now\"\nend run\n\n\n\n*The shortcut Control-⌥ Option-⌘ cmd-⏏ Eject\n\n*Clicking shutdown with ⌥ Alt / ⌥ Option held down (as you said)\n\n*If using Alfred, you can summon the Alfred window and start typing \"Shut down\" or \"Restart\" and then pressing Enter. No Power Pack needed, no force quits, no dialog and no countdown.\nYou could also try following this method by WZZZ, but I haven't checked if it works. It reduces the time to auto-quit apps, so do: \ndefaults write org.x.X11 wm_auto_quit_timeout -int x\n\nA: I'm not sure why you would want to do this, but the only way to have the Apple menu items not prompt for confirmation (and without the use of the option modifier) would involve editing the system's interface files to substitute the \"now\" items that display with the option key for the ones that display normally.\nMy approach would be to expand on item #3 of shub's answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command+Option+Control+Eject - Shutdown\n\n*Command+Control+Eject - Restart\n\n*Command+Option+Shift+Q - Log Out\n\n\nAlso some elaboration on the AppleScript approach:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    shut down           -- or 'log out' or 'restart' or 'sleep'\nend tell\n\nThis won't ask for confirmation but also won't force-quit everything.\n", "Q: Early 2013 Macbook Pro with 4K From what I'm reading online it sounds like 4K displays like Seiki displays will work correctly with a late 2013 MBP or later. I have an early 2013 MBP and am not finding much of any evidence that a 4K display will work with this model. Will a 4K display work at 3840x2160 with at least 30 Hz on a early 2013 MBP? Does anyone have this or a similar setup that could provide feedback or any issues that have? I'm interested in an external display with a high resolution and 4K seems like the best option.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to drive a 4k Display with an early 2013 and even 2012 Retina Macbook.\n1. Download SwitchResX\nhere\n2. Create a new custom profile for your monitor\nSimplified Settings: CVT-RB\nActive: 3840x2160\nScan Rate vertical: 30\n\nHit ok and press cmd-S to save.\n3. Reboot and select custom profile\n\nBased on this thread\n\nA: I have early 2013 15\" retina mbp and I can drive seiki 39 4K TV via HDMI (using supplied cable) just fine.\n\nA: Its possible with SwitchResX and this stuff. Mini DisplayPort 1.2 to HDMI 2.0a Active Adapter 4K@60Hz\nI have a MBP, early 2013, and it's working with 60Hz + 4k.\nThere are many adapters out there, but be sure is 4k + 60hz active, otherwise will not work.\n\nA: I have been using 4K monitors with an Early 2013 Retina Macbook Pro since August 2014, and have an issue which is consistent across both 4k Monitors - the screen will go blank for a few seconds sporadically.  It doesn't happen often enough for it to be a big issue, but it can be annoying.  Most of the time i run at 2560 x 1440, but i can go up to 3840 x 2160, both at 30HZ.  Both of these require a good quality HDMI cable v1.3.\nThe monitors i have used are Samsung U28D590D and Asus PB287Q.  The Asus gives a richer picture, but the Samsung is brighter.\n\nA: On my early 2013 15\" rMBP and LG 27UD88-W 27\" 4K UHD Monitor, and SwitchResX, I tried mDP to DP, HDMI to HDMI, all 4K compatible cables, and finally active mDP to HDMI 4k 60Hz cable. I could not get 60 Hz on any cable at 4K.\n(DP = DisplayPort. mDP = mini DisplayPort. rMBP = retina macbook pro)\nThis LG monitor has DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 2.\nhas DisplayPort 1.1a and HDMI 1.4.\nThis was the last cable I tried:\nhttps://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1616926-REG/ezquest_x40085_active_mini_displayport_to.html\nThe cable I'm sticking with is the Startech mDP to DP, and the HDMI cable I tried was a 4K Belkin HDMI cable from the apple store.\nSwitchResX did help me get more resolution options than the standard display settings would. I am now using 2304 x 1296, HiDPI, at 30Hz. I think I've tried everything.\nI think it's because the early 2013 rMBP is limited to DP 1.1a, according to Dell. Also according to Dell, late 2013 rMBP has DP 1.2, which should be able to do 4K 60Hz\nhttps://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000128111/4k-5k-high-resolution-display-support-by-mac-systems\nAnd according to Wikipedia, DP 1.1a is limited to HBR, which is limited to 30 Hz at 4K / 3840 × 2160.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort\nI'm not sure how the other commenters are getting 4K 60Hz, but I think I've tried everything, and the results I've got are in line w/ the specs I could find. I knew nothing about any of this 2 weeks ago, and this was what I found trying to figure it out.\n\n\nA: No. According to this Apple Support article, 4K Display is not supported. The highest resolution your machine can support on an external monitor is 2560x1600. \n", "Q: Font Editor on OS X? I have some fonts that has the same name (but they are different in weight). The default OS X font controller won't let me change their name. What are the editors out there can do it?\n\nA: There is a method to change the internal name of a font - so you can see it differently from within an app - but you'll need to use Terminal, but it is not very hard: \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are on an admin account \n\n*Install Xcode (You'll need to login with your Apple ID for free, I'm not sure if this is actually necessary, so do it last if the next few steps don't work. I have Xcode installed so I can't tell whether having it makes a difference)\n\n*Download TTX \n\n*Open Terminal (from Applications > Utilities)\n\n*Type cd with a space at the end, find the place at which you downloaded the fonttools-2.4 folder at (in step 3) and drag it onto the Terminal Window. Press enter\n\n*Copy and paste this: sudo python setup.py install\n\n*Enter your admin password when asked. You won't see it being typed it.\nYou've now installed TTX. Now I will tell you how to change the font name:\n\n*Type ttx with a space after it, find your font file and drag it onto the Terminal window. Press enter. OS X stores fonts at many places. Check here for more info. \n\n*Now, in the font directory you just dragged the file from, you will find a new *.ttx file. Open it in Textedit.\n\n*Press Cmd + F. Type in fullname in the Find box. You will find something like: <FullName value = \"*\" />\n\n*Copy the name in the quotes. Press Cmd + F again and paste this in the Find box. In the Replace box, type in your desired Font Name. Click Replace All.\n\nNote: If your font has a name that would commonly be used in a font file such as “Glyph” or “Asterisk” you may get some unwanted text replacement and possibly produce an unusable .ttx file. In these cases you should manually scroll through the font file and replace the instances where the name listed.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*'Save As' the file. Leave the name as it is - or you can change it to anything because this is the file name not internal name. Make sure the filename is *.TTX. Save it in the desired location for the new font.\n\n*Go back to Terminal. Type ttx with a space after it, find your font file that you just saved and drag it onto the Terminal window. Press enter. \nYou will now find the new otf file in the same directory. \n\nNote. If you want to repeat this with a new file, start with step 8.\n\nMore info here (this is a little bit confusing, but it may help.)\n", "Q: How can I update my OS X 10.5.8? This is the first time I've ever had a computer that didn't play out on me before it needed an upgrade and now I'm lost. This is also my first Mac laptop, and I am running OS X 10.5.8 (Yes, I realize it's old…I had it put up for a while)\nCan someone tell me the next step or steps that I can take to do an upgrade?  I have no clue which animal I'm running or what I need to go to. I'm noticing more and more sites/actions are telling me that they are not compatible because my system is no longer up to date.\n\nA: See here: http://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/\nTL;DR: buy a DVD to update to Snow Leopard and then update it to Mavericks (if your hardware supports it).\n\nA: Before you upgrade you should deeply consider the question \"why upgrade?\" \nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard is a mature and stable operating system that has some very interesting and particular features that are not available in most of the more recent OS X releases, including the Classic Environment and a transparent emulation layer that both allow you to run (possibly expensive or irreplacible) software that ran on earlier Mac system software and fundamentally different hardware, respectively, before Apple switched to PPC, released the first versions of Mac OS X, and then switched to x86 based hardware.  After all, what isn't broken cannot be fixed, and often \"fixing\" something that isn't broken will indeed lead to the discovery at the worst imaginable moments that essential functionality is broken or no longer exists. \nThe affirmative answer to the question should be along the lines of:\n1) there are security concerns that you hope to resolve\n2) there are software bugs that you hope to resolve\n3) there are new features available and you wish to take advantage of them\nThere is nothing wrong with remaining at a version of a stable and mature operating system that is perhaps getting long in the tooth, and this is especially poignant with older hardware if after upgrading you discover that you have lost something that you needed. The temptation and immediate compulsion to click \"update\" or \"upgrade\" as soon as it is available or one receives notice of it is definitely not considered a \"best practice,\" regardless of what most users are doing or even what the software or hardware vendor recommends that you do. Only you can decide, after careful consideration, what is in your best interests, as going backwards sometimes is not an option (as is the case with Apple's iOS operating system).\n", "Q: Install windows (bootcamp) without CD or USB Flash Drive I'm currently trying to install windows on my macbook (13in, 2011), but without any success.\nMy CD drive is dead (as a matter of facts its ruining any cds I put in it), and I simply cant boot via USB. Im running Mavericks. I've tried enabling USB burning on bootcamp assistant and codesigning it, and it worked for Windows 8, I could even boot, but couldn't install it on the bootcamp partition. As soon as I get to the screen in which to select the partition, windows refuses to install, with some error code. I've also tried formatting this partition as ntfs from inside the windows installer, but it doesn't work also. After I did that, whenever I restart my macbook, I get an error message saying \"No bootable device found\" or something like that, and I can only get back to OSX by holding option and selecting it manually. After All of that I've tried windows 7, and this time the bootloader (when I hold the option key) doesn't recognize the usb anymore.\nSo, as nothing works, how can I install windows? (It's for gaming purposes).\nMaybe I can make a small partition, burn the windows installer to it and boot from that?\nIt sounds like a plan, but I cant find how to burn a .iso to a partition anywhere.\n\nA: This might seem like a long shot, but it was also the only option for me to install Windows into my Bootcamp partition a little while back.\nIt's also the only option for a Mac that used to have an optical drive but no longer does, since for some reason these devices are no longer able to boot from USB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Disk Utility to create a FAT partition a little larger than your wanted Windows partition.\n\n*Install rEFIt.\n\n*Reboot twice for rEFIt to install properly. As soon as you see the rEFIt boot menu when starting, it's good. Here you choose the 'Partition Tool', with which you'll change the MBR (Master Boot Record). (On a side note: You can easily uninstall rEFIt by renaming the directory at the root of your harddrive)\n\n*Install VirtualBox, Parallels or VMware. I did this with VMware back at the time, but all of these should work as long as you're able to mount the virtual harddrive like any removable disk.\n\n*Use the virtualization software to install Windows into a virtual machine at the size of your wanted partition (not what you made it above, but a little smaller than that). You can of course install from an ISO here, making the state of your disc drive irrelevant. Kill the virtual machine as soon as it reboots the first time after finishing the installation, stopping Windows before being able to configure itself.\n\n*Use the virtualization software's features to mount the virtual harddrive. \n\n*Install a tool called WinClone.\n\n*If your virtual drive is mounted, WinClone should be able to see this in the tab 'Image'. Pull this into an image onto your harddrive.\n\n*Now choose the 'Restore' tab in WinClone and restore this image to your Bootcamp partition.\n\n*Now you can reboot and boot into your Bootcamp partition with rEFIt, which is no longer of any use from this point on, but you can keep it around as well. Windows should now continue configuring itself and finish the installation.\n\n\nI stumbled across this solution here in the Apple Support Community and posted about it here a while ago on a German Apple User Forum, if that turns out to be of any use to anybody.\n", "Q: How do I return a lost de-activated phone to the owner?

By the time I woke up the next morning the owner had obviously deactivated the phone. Is there anyway of returning it to the person? Or if not is there anything I can do with iPhone - as otherwise it's just a useless piece of equipment / wasted phone.\nThanks.\n\nA: If you want to return the phone to the owner after it has been wiped, then you will need to contact the carrier.  Use a small paperclip to remove the SIM tray and access the nano SIM card.  On one of the sides you should see a printed number which is the ICC-ID.  Enter the number here to determine the carrier if the carrier name is not printed on the card.  Call the carrier's customer support number and explain that you found a wiped phone and all you have is the ICC-ID number and the IMEI/MEID number.  That should be enough for them to pull up the subscriber information if they are willing to do so.  The only other information they might need in order to identify the owner is the IMSI in which case you would have to take the SIM card to a phone repair shop to read the number off of the SIM card.  As for whether the carrier will help, I don't know.\nNote, the IMEI/MEID is engraved on the back case, near the bottom of the phone.\n", "Q: how to change NFS share name as displayed in OSX without reconfiguring NFS server?

I have tried to install Mavericks on my MacBook Pro 10.7.5 laptop. It has some software that was added by well-meaning enterprise IT people. \nHere's what I see after downloading and attempting to install Mavericks: \n\nI would like to force this update to happen, but I can't figure out how to make it happen. I should add that I do have root access. Any suggestions appreciated!\nEdit\nAs pointed out in the comments, this error message is almost certainly not from Apple. I agree with this, as when I first encountered this error message upon trying to install the Mavericks upgrade I copied the text verbatim into Google and found nothing. \nSo the question, now, is can I, as a user with root access, force an installation of Mavericks? It seems in principle that it should be possible. However, I have no foggy idea how to make it happen.\n\nA: The message shown in the screenshot is almost certainly not an Apple official message for two reasons: they never refer to the Mac App Store as the 'Apple App Store' and the icon/text layout isn't correct per any other OS X message I've seen.\nThe most likely cause of the restriction is the JAMF MDM software installed on your Mac (based on the log from your last question).\nTherefore, the software that is preventing Mavericks install can't prevent it if you're not booted into that OS. You should be able to create an install media using DiskMakerX. Then, boot into this install media and install Mavericks that way.\n\nA: I would make a backup, then boot the Mac holding Command and R and then follow this instruction.\n", "Q: Internet sharing via WiFi won't work (BSS stopping) I'm trying to start internet sharing on my mac mini (share ethernet to wifi).\nUntil a few days ago, it worked fine, and suddenly stopped working.\nI'm pretty sure my \"graphical\" config is fine (with the System settings app).

home)\n\n*different interfaces (via wi-fi or ethernet)\n\n*reboot (even system updates, currently 10.9.2)\n\n*different DNS (\"automatic\" as well as google 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4)\n\n\nUPDATE:\nSolved! Thanks.... It was a \"VPN over ssh\" client sshuttle that changed my /etc/hosts file to redirect from wikimedia (among >1000 others…)\n\nA: In the assumption that you have no software installed that would explicitly block those sites here is how to block and unblock web sites.\n\nA Mac’s hosts file is a simple text file that dictates what the system\n  should do when specific domains or IP addresses are accessed. \nYou can trigger a “page cannot be displayed” error or even redirect them to\n  other domains/IPs of your choice. \nFor the sake of this tutorial, all\n  blocked websites will be pointed to 127.0.0.1, which is the localhost\n  or system itself.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*To get started, Copy and paste the following code in Terminal:\nsudo /bin/cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts-original\n\n  \n*Terminal will ask for your password. \n  \n*Now we can start editing the hosts file. Copy and paste this code in Terminal (all one line):\nsudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts\n\nThe hosts file will open in TextEdit. \n\nNotice the following lines and do not delete them under any circumstances:\n\n127.0.0.1           localhost\n255.255.255.255     broadcasthost\n::1                 localhost\nfe80::1%lo0         localhost\n\nYou should not have any further data here.\n\nCreate a new line directly under the last one shown above. Type the following, replacing the sample domain with the domain or IP\n  address you want to block:\n    127.0.0.1 sample.com www.sample.com\n\nContinue adding lines following the format in step 6 for each website you want to block. When you’re done, quit TextEdit and save\n  the hosts file when prompted.\n  Back in Terminal, run the following command to flush the computer’s DNS and put the new hosts file into effect. You can restartyour Mac instead, if you prefer.\n    dscacheutil -flushcache\n\nThat’s all there is to it! Websites added to the hosts file will no\n  longer be accessible from any user account on that Mac. \n\nIn your case look for the blocked IP's\n\n  \n*\n  \n*re-enable access to blocked websites, just repeat this process and\n  remove the lines you added in the hosts file. Just remember not to\n  delete the original 4 lines shown in step 5.\n  \n\n", "Q: What is the best way to connect a MacBook Pro to a Samsung TV set? I would like to connect my MacBook Pro, which has Mini-DVI DisplayPort and FireWire ports (I have DisplayPort to DVI converter as well).\nWhat is the best way to connect it to a Samsung TV, which has the ports shown below?\n\n\n\nA: Well it really depends on WHICH MacBook Pro you have as there are a number of output options available.\nIf you have a fairly recent one I would get the mini display port to HDMI adapter available from Apple (or Amazon, or whoever) and an HDMI cable and use that. It also has the benefit of carrying audio as well so you don't need a separate audio cable.\nI use this exact setup with my Mac Mini to play videos I get from the iTunes store on my living room TV set. Works a treat!\n\nA: Mini-DVI does not carry audio, so a Mini-DVI to HDMI cable won't carry audio. However, it is by far superior to VGA or component connections.\nFor the audio, you can use a 3.5mm male to male cable, and connect to the PC/DVI AUDIO IN jack. You can also use a 3.5mm cable to red and white components like the one below. They're of equal quality, so it comes down to what you can find.\n\nThe most favourable option for audio however, depends not on your TV but on your audio system. I see you have an optical audio out cable leading out of your TV, which leads me to assume you have an audio system which accepts at least one optical audio input. Using a toshlink cable with a toshlink to minitoshlink adapter (which are typically sold together) with the audio connection will ensure the highest quality audio (even support surround sound).\n\n", "Q: iPad 1 Software Update A friend of mine has a first gen iPad that needs updating but doesn't have a computer to plug it into to do the update.  Can I use my MBP without trashing my iTunes and her iTunes?\n\nA: Yes, you can use your Mac and not trash anything. (Especially if you know how iTunes syncs to iOS). \nFor simplicity's sake, you might want to create a new account on your Mac so your friend can enter her Apple ID account in to the Mac if needed to update apps.\nThis also keeps her backup separate from your backup and simplifies life if you want to transfer her purchases to iTunes (which iTunes will want to do to ensure it can restore the iPad should the update/upgrade fail for some odd reason).\nI would say, just start with getting a good backup to a new account and then see if the device even needs an update. If you connect her device to your iTunes on your account - you might have some learning and clean up if her contacts mix with your contacts, etc...\n\nA: You can sync multiple devices with iTunes, but new devices have to be deleted. You will recive a Notification if you plug in the device. But if your friend has the original iPad, then he must have pluged it into a computer at some time, because there was no possibility of setting up the device without a computer before iOS 5.\n\nA: Create a different user account for this job on your MB. Remember that the 1st Gen iPad doesn't upgrade further than 5.1.1, so there actually may not be an update.\n", "Q: Create a new (.txt) File in Finder - Keyboard Shortcut I wanted to know if there is way to set keyboard shortcuts to make new files in Finder. For example, by default, you can create a new folder using CMD+Shift+N. Is there a keyboard shortcut to create a new text file? I'm a programmer so this would be extremely useful\nI would also be interested in creating other file type using keyboard shortcuts. \nI have attempted to use automator but I'm finding it quite confusing and I'm not sure how I would connect a keyboard shortcut to it.\n\nA: You could also assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set selection to make new file at (get insertion location)\nend tell\n\nThe insertion location is either the target of the frontmost Finder window or the desktop.\n\nA: Well, here you go with an AppleScript for that.\nFirst, create the AppleScript:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator\n\n*Create a Quick Action\n\n*Set the input to no input\n\n*Drag and Drop the Run AppleScript workflow element onto the grey space.\n\n*Paste the code from below into the AppleScript\n\n*Save the workflow as Create new file\nIf you have iCloud Drive activated, make sure you are saving the file under Library/Services/ in your Home Folder.\n\n\n\ntry\n  tell application \"Finder\" to set the this_folder ¬\n   to (folder of the front window) as alias\non error -- no open folder windows\n  set the this_folder to path to desktop folder as alias\nend try\n\nset thefilename to text returned of (display dialog ¬\n \"Create file named:\" default answer \"filename.txt\")\nset thefullpath to POSIX path of this_folder & thefilename\ndo shell script \"touch \\\"\" & thefullpath & \"\\\"\"\n\n\nTo add it as a shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services\n\n*Scroll down until you find the Service Create new file\n\n*Assign a shortcut to it by clicking on the right side none, which turns into a Add Shortcut.\nClick the Button and type the shortcut you wish to use.\nI use ⌘ Command+⌥ Option+N\n\nA: You can create an Automator Service yourself — it is rather simple to do. Then you can assign a keyboard shortcut to it so that you don't need to activate the service through the services menu (which you can do anyway).\nOpen Automator and select Service as the type of new document.\nSet the service to receive no input in Finder.app and add the New TextEdit Document action to the workflow.\n\nSave the service, then open System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services where you will find the service listed under General with the name that you gave for the service when you saved it.\n\nAdd a keyboard shortcut to the service by selecting the service then clicking 'add shortcut'.\nHere you might have some problems if the shortcut is used already. So get creative to make one that works for you.\n\nA: open terminal and type\ntouch filename\n\nor \n> filename\n\n\nA: I've created an AppleScript very similar to the @YoshiBotX's one, but with some improvements.\nThe idea is to create an Automator workflow and assigning a shortcut to it using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and create a Service;\n\n*Set the input to no input, and the application to Finder.app;\n\n*Drag and Drop the Run AppleScript workflow element onto the grey space;\n\n*Put the contents of this AppleScript in the textbox;\n\n*Save the workflow with a reasonable name (like New File);\n\n*Go to Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services and assign a shortcut to it.\n\n\nNow, let's show the AppleScript:\nset file_name to \"untitled\"\nset file_ext to \".txt\"\nset is_desktop to false\n\n-- get folder path and if we are in desktop (no folder opened)\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set this_folder to (folder of the front Finder window) as alias\n    end tell\non error\n    -- no open folder windows\n    set this_folder to path to desktop folder as alias\n    set is_desktop to true\nend try\n\n-- get the new file name (do not override an already existing file)\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set file_list to get the name of every disk item of this_folder\nend tell\nset new_file to file_name & file_ext\nset x to 1\nrepeat\n    if new_file is in file_list then\n        set new_file to file_name & \" \" & x & file_ext\n        set x to x + 1\n    else\n        exit repeat\n    end if\nend repeat\n\n-- create and select the new file\ntell application \"Finder\"\n\n    activate\n    set the_file to make new file at folder this_folder with properties {name:new_file}\n    if is_desktop is false then\n        reveal the_file\n    else\n        select window of desktop\n        set selection to the_file\n        delay 0.1\n    end if\nend tell\n\n-- press enter (rename)\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Finder\"\n        keystroke return\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nFor convenience, I'm putting this AppleScript in this GitHub Gist. \n\nA: In the new macOS Shortcuts, you can use the \"Run AppleScript\" and below code. In case there already was a file with the same name then Shortcuts will show you a clear run error message that is legible to an end user.\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set selection to make new file at (get insertion location) with properties {name:\"README.txt\"}\n    end tell\n    return input\nend run\n\n\nA: This is a repost of a post that I made last year.  I have had good experience with the following.\nThere are two useful utilities that you can download and install that will enable you to create a new text file (or RTF file) in a currently-open folder that you are viewing using the Finder.\nThe utilities are called NewTextFileHere and NewRTFHere and can be downloaded from\nhttp://mac.softpedia.com/developer/Jonas-Wisser-37498.html\nIcons for either of these apps can then be included on all of your Finder windows.\n\nA: Just what I'd been looking for, Richard Fuhr. Thanks for this. \nOne note: that URL's link for the NewTextFileHere seems to load to an empty page. But I did a search and found the app here: \nhttp://mac.softpedia.com/progDownload/NewTextFileHere-Download-70374.html\n\nA: An alternative, if you already have BetterTouchTools (it used to be a free app, now it has a pay-what-you-want model with a 30 day trial period), you can find the action on \"Utility Actions > Create New File in Current Folder\" which does exactly this, with a pop-up to let you pick the name. Assign the shortcut you want (I picked Option+Shift+N) and you're good to go.\n\nA: In case you are using MacVim there is an option under Finder -> Services to create a new vim buffer:\n\nI have mapped this to the short cut ShiftcmdM in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts:\n\n", "Q: Font rendering issue with Word 2011 and 3rd party font (Admiration Pains) I downloaded the Admiration Pains font, installed it via Font Book, and verified it works fine in applications like Adobe CS and TextEdit. Unfortunately, when I try to use the font in Microsoft Word 2011, the font renders as some generic font (e.g. Times New Roman).  When I highlight the text, Word still reports the font family as Admiration Pains.  \nThings I've tried with no success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting Word;\n\n*Deleting the Font Cache file and restarting Word;\n\n*Changing font size;\n\n*Looked for \"enabled duplicates\" in Font Book;\n\n*Confirmed font is enabled in Font Book and that it Validates w/out issue;\n\n*Using Font Nuke to remove all caches of fonts and restarting computer.\n\n\nAny ideas on how I can get this font to render properly in Word?\nHere's a screenshot of the font trying to be used, where it renders fine in the font drop down, but not in the document:\n\n\nA: My workaround was to use FontForge to open the TTF file and then re-generate the font family in TrueType format. Now Word 2011 shows it correctly.\n", "Q: Open Sans Chrome and Safari Render bug The \"Open Sans\" font for some reason just started looking terrible on both Chrome and Safari (on Mavericks 10.9.2), becoming some super thin and light font. Does anyone know what's up? I tried resetting my font cache, but it didn't work!\nSee the images below, (1) On Todoist.com (which uses Open Sans), and (2) On Google Docs, where my body text uses the Open Sans font. You can see in the 2nd image, the word \"Rhapsody in Red\" in the body is Open Sans Italics, which looks vastly different from the regular Open Sans. The problem does not affect the Italics version, only the regular version.\n\n\n\nA: Try restoring the system fonts using the Font Book.app\nOpen and click Restore Standard fonts.\n", "Q: Enable 3G button missing on iPhone 4s I bought a secondhand iPhone 4s recently with iOS 7.0.4 installed.\nI'm in Indonesia and I am using Telkomsel as my cellular provider.\nWhen I am using it, the battery is decreasing fast. So I updated the iOS to 7.1.1.\nBut, what I got is the battery decreasing faster, and my iPhone is so hot, especially at Micro-SIM card area. Is this normal in iOS 7.1.1 at iPhone 4s?\nWhat I want to do to decrease the heat is changing the network. My iPhone always using 3G connection, so I want to change it to 2G because I rarely use the 3G connection.\nThe \"Enable 3G\" toggle button should be at Settings → Cellular → Enable 3G, but mine is gone!\n\nI compare it with my friend's iPhone which can switch 2G and 3G, and i suspect 1 thing, Carrier. I can see Carrier in Settings → General → About (EE 16.0).\n\nI've been googling and found that this Carrier setting can hide this Enable 3G button, because they want to stop using 2G.\nIs it true, this Carrier setting is hidden the Enable 3G toggle button?\nthen, How to change it to Telkomsel (my cellular provider)?\n\nA: Did you buy your phone from someone in the UK (where the EE network is available)?\nAccording to Apple your phone should automatically update carrier settings when you connect to a new network. I assume you have the correct APN defined? If you're not sure, take a look here - having the incorrect APN may prevent the update from working.\n\nA: jailbreak is the answer for that... When you use your local Carrier, you can already use 3g enabling it in your iPhone settings.\n", "Q: How can I encrypt a folder in OS X Mavericks If possible, how can I encrypt a folder with a password on OS X Mavericks?\n\nA: OS X doesn't ship with a folder by folder encryption. You can create an encrypted sparse bundle which acts as a folder that is decrypted once it mounts and stores all contents in an encrypted form on disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable advanced image options in Disk Utility:\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility advanced-image-options 1\n\n\n*Open Disk Utility (found in /Applications/Utilities/).\n\n*Select File → New → Disk Image from Folder… or press ⌘ cmd+⇧ shift+N.\n\n*Select the folder that contains your files and press Image.\n\n*Choose sparsebundle as the Image Format, and choose the level of encryption you require.\n\n\n*Choose a password to encrypt the image. Make sure to uncheck the Remember password in my Keychain box if you want to be prompted each time you attempt to mount the disk.\n\n*Click OK. Disk Utility will create a sparse bundle to hold your files. Don't forget to delete the original folder.\nYou can make an alias (or a symbolic link, symlink for short) to folders in the encrypted folder to hide much of the difference between a disk image and the actual encrypted folder if desired. Alternatively, you can mount this disk image in a custom folder (instead of /Volumes) for even smoother access.\n\nA: If you are willing to consider an app, there's a review on Tidbits of Hider 2:\nhttp://tidbits.com/e/14740\nIn the comments are references to Knox and Concealer.\n", "Q: 2013 MacBook Pro Retina 13\" vs MacBook Air 13\" I am considering buying a 13\" MacBook.

At first it would not boot up at all, not even showing the grey circle with the line in it or anything at all. I did internet recovery and did some cleaning up of the hard drive but it was saying I had problems with the partition boot. It was giving me some screen saying \"Unable to find driver for this platform\" after booting though. I went back into internet recovery, erased the drive, and re-installed os x. It was giving me the same error at first, but then I started it in safe mode and it worked.

(does require restart)\n", "Q: Launching/showing calendar from the menu bar Is there any app that would allow me to preview the calendar from the menu bar (i.e. show calendar with a single click)?\nIt's all I need, I don't even need to open calendar from that app, though it would be nice.\n\nA: Day-O\n\n\nDay-O is a simple menu bar clock replacement with a simple calendar\n  for your Mac. It’s free, as-is (which means I’m not providing support,\n  taking feature requests, addressing perceived inadequacies or\n  releasing the source code).\n\n\nA: Fantastical\nA dedicated calendar menu bar item, Fantastical lets you view and modify your calendar from your menu bar.\n\nYour events have never looked better\n  Plan your day in style with the most attractive calendar you've ever seen. Fantastical's beautiful design helps you quickly make sense of your schedule.

I have the Do Not Disturb feature scheduled to work from Midnight to 7 am.  This works great.  \nHowever, on the weekend I like to sleep in and would like the Do Not Disturb feature to go until 9 am.  But I do not see this feature.  It's like all or nothing.\nAm I missing something simple?\n\nA: This currently can't be done. Schedules you select apply to all the days of the week.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple on the following page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html\n\nA: It now can be done!\nUse the automation section of the Shortcuts app. \n", "Q: Is there a better way to manage Text Messages? Looking at the space distribution of my phone, I see that Messages account for 7 GB.  \nThere are a lot of photos and videos that have been sent over the years and I am assuming that locating and deleting them would free up some space.  \nHowever, scrolling to the top and tapping Load Earlier Messages is really tedious, not to mention that it becomes ridiculously slow after the 20th tap or so.  \nIs there a better way to deal with getting rid of some text messages?\n\nA: If you are jailbroken, you can use iCleaner:\n\nSource: http://www.iclarified.com/images/news/37323/160771/160771.jpg\n\nMessage attachments: it deletes files sent and received via iMessage or MMS. The “smart” setting only deletes files that do not show up in any message, while “on” deletes all attachments (messages with attachments will show a blank icon).\n\nSource: http://www.funkyspacemonkey.com/icleaner-ultimate-ios-device-cleaning-app\n", "Q: iOS App Store: free limited version of app I would like to have a free trial version of my app, with limited functionality, and at the same time to have a full paid version. The apps can have slightly different names on App Store, say MyApp 1.0 and MyApp 1.0 (Limited).\nDoes this violate Apple's policies? \n\nA: You are permitted to have free, lite versions of your app in the App Store.\nHowever, demo/trial versions are prohibited per the App Store Guidelines.\n\n2.9 Apps that are \"beta\", \"demo\", \"trial\", or \"test\" versions will be rejected\n\nA far better solution is to offer a full featured free trial and then offer purchase and or subscription to maintain the paid app status.  Watch the 2018 WWDC videos on App Store changes to get details on how a developer might implement this.  On the policy side, this is pretty clear-cut and allowable by Apple. \n", "Q: Why is same privileged bash command giving different information from script than from command line? I wrote a bash script to verify various configs on a system, but I am getting different results depending on whether it is run from the command line directly or from the script. Here is the command:\nbt_discoverable=$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep Discoverable)\n\nIf I disable discoverable on the bluetooth and then echo the variable on the command line I get the expected result:\nDiscoverable: No\n\nBut if I echo it immediately after running the same command from a bash script, I get\nDiscoverable: Yes\n\nThe script does elevate its privileges through an internal sudo function, so I commented the block for that function out and ran the script again. This time, things worked as they should. Here is the elevation function:\nRunAsRoot()\n{\n        if [[ \"${USER}\" != \"root\" ]] ; then\n                echo\n                echo\n                echo \"***  Type the password for ${USER} and press ENTER  ***\"\n                echo\n                sudo $1 && exit 0\n        fi\n}\nRunAsRoot $0\n\nThis function is the first thing the script runs, so the code position is a problem.\nWhy does running in an elevated privilege (sub)shell cause this issue? Is the problem Terminal, Bash, or something else I'm ignorant of?\n\nA: The difference comes from the change in shell environment once elevated. I'm not sure how you would write a script that would account for this change easily, but the answer to my original question is that you need to be aware of such differences when you elevate privileges.\nThanks to \"thankyour\" for this lead. I finally posted this as an answer since they didn't for some weeks.\n\nA: This is my workaround\nbt_discoverable=$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep Discoverable)\n\nsudoMe()\n{\n    if [[ \"${USER}\" != \"root\" ]]; then\n    echo \"inside...as: $USER\"\n    sudo $0 && sudoBack\n\n    fi\n}\n\ndoAsRoot(){\n    if [[ \"${USER}\" == \"root\" ]]; then\n        echo \"this as $USER\"\n    fi\n}\n\nsudoBack(){\n    if [[ \"${USER}\" == \"root\" ]]; then\n        echo \"reverse...from: $USER\"\n        sudo -k && exit 0\n    fi\n}\n\ndiscover() {\n    echo $bt_discoverable\n}\n\nsudoMe \ndoAsRoot\nsudoBack\ndiscover\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudoMe will elevate to root by calling the script again.\n\n*All following functions like doAsRoot must check for $USER == root, otherwise will run in first call of script as invoking $USER.\n\n*sudoBack will elevate down using sudo -k\n\n*All following functions like discover will now run as first $USER\nIf we invoke as root like in the answer, there is no way IMHO back with sudo -k in any part of the script.

I can do it through Finder, but this is inconvenient since I can only connect with one username at a time. I read that mounting via Terminal would allow me to connect with multiple usernames at the same time. I found this post: How can I mount an SMB share from the command line? where the command to mount is\nmount_smbfs //user@SERVER/folder ./mntpoint\n\nbut whether I do that or mount -t smbfs instead of mount_smbfs I get the same error:\nmount_smbfs: mount error: [mountpoint path]: Input/output error\n\nSomeone even mentioned getting the same error in that post I linked to above, but no one answered him.\nEdit:\nFor the sake of being complete, here's my actual input and output (with the username and password replaced).

My MacBook Pro is running, ssh works fine, but the screen does not respond anymore. \nThe screen is frozen like the ice of Antarctica. The mouse does not move on the screen. The time of the clock does not change.\nThe Caps Lock light of the keyboard is responding.\nCan you help me to get my screen responding again, please?\nWhat I need is simply having my screen responding, in order to use my Mac and to continue what I was doing.\n\nA: Since you can ssh into the box, you can start killing processes one by one and eventually you will either reboot the box or free up the item that's holding the CPU / GUI frozen.\nI would probably do these things in order of severity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a time machine backup before killing anything tmutil startbackup --block --rotation\n\n*If I don't care to save work (since this kills all apps abruptly) - kill the loginwindow process and log back in.\n\n*If I do care to save some work, kill all user processes not belonging to the user that needs to save work.\n\n*Then kill all user processes that don't need work saved. (Apps and such)\n\n*Then use AppleScript to tell each app that needs to save work to quit. (assuming the GUI isn't responsive at this point)\n\n\n\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Take Five\" '\n\nAt this point, you'll either need to list the specific apps that you need to save work and ask if there are any ways to force a save (perhaps they use autosave and will recover all work anyhow) or just issue a restart / reboot command and get on with using the machine and recover what you can from your last backup.\n\nA: Killing WindowServer will get you out of most situations, but all GUI apps will die and restart with it.\nThe solution is to save data in all apps that don't do it automatically using Applescript\nps ax | grep -i appname\nosascript save.scpt 6546, where 6546 is the PID of your app\nThe script will press Cmd+S and (optionally) Enter\non run argv\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set theprocs to every process whose unix id is item 1 of argv\n    repeat with proc in theprocs\n        set the frontmost of proc to true\n        delay 1\n        keystroke \"s\" using command down\n        delay 1\n        # key code 36 # Enter\n    end repeat\nend tell\nend run\n\nP.S. This works from SSH session for apps like Sublime Text, but I can't figure out the way to tell the app to quit gracefully. It's either kill or reboot. The latter should take care of apps that support \"Resume\" feature.\n\nA: I know this is a late answer, and you may have already given up. I did a quick search and found that you can enable screen sharing (VNC) via SSH without AppleScript.\nsudo  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart \\\n-activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes \\\n-clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw mypasswd -restart -agent -privs -all\n\nI copied that command verbatim from here. You want to omit the restart flag, I believe. Connect to your machine with a VNC client, save all of your work, and reboot the machine. \n", "Q: Accessing OS X built in dictionary lookup in Firefox I am really frustrated that Firefox does not provide the three-finger-tap lookup operation is in built in OS X. What is baffling me is that it supports other gestures such as two finger swipes and taps. So why not the 3 finger tap dictionary ? \nIs this possible to actually implement ? Or is it because access to in built dictionary and trackpad is blocked by OS ?

For example https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/look-up-in-dictionary-7261/\nEDIT (Oct 2017): I'm now using the new e10s Firefox and the dictionary lookup still works. You don't need any plugin, just tap with three fingers or press Control + Cmd + D.\n\nA: One can open the MacOS dictionary by typing dict://word-in-question in the address bar.\nThis extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/macos-dictionary-lookup/ adds a menu item to do it. In order for it to work, you need to do the above process manually, and allow Firefox to open the dictionary app.\n", "Q: Can I get around Bento's Database Password?

Is there a way I can always have the shared folder available and have the computer remember my password for it?\n\nA: Yes, the \"+\" button to the right of the pathname text field will save the path for you.\nAlso, when you authenticate to the server, there should be a checkbox beneath the username/password fields.  The checkbox should read \"Remember this password in my keychain.\"  If that's selected when you successfully authenticate, then your credentials will be saved to your keychain and used automatically when you try to connect.\n\nA: Preferring to limit what I trust to KeyChain for this type of thing, I just make an alias (finder, file menu, make an alias) of the shared folder and park it on the desktop (or in another local folder.) Clicking on the alias will bring up the login window with the name used when the folder was aliased filled in, I type in my password, the share is mounted and I'm in the folder. If the share is already mounted, it just takes me to the folder. \nIf you use the \"save my password\" checkbox, clicking on the alias will just take you to the folder.\n", "Q: Minimum partition size for normal osx usage? I want to set up a linux/osx dual boot on a mbp with a shared zfs pool for data and /home. My question then is, if /Users is on a separate partition, does anyone have any recommendations towards how large the osx partition should be?\nThere're a couple of threads that seem to indicate that it has to be at least 9-10GB (What's the minimum partition size for osx mavericks when dual booting with windows 8?), but this is obviously a bare bones minimum rather than a typical scenario for a normal laptop setup. \nI know that I can easily get away with a <5GB /root in linux, but I have no experience with macs. Thanks!\n\nA: You're on the right track with 9-10GB if you're doing a barebones OS X install.  See the OS X Mavericks requirements. However...\nIf you're keeping the root /Applications on the same volume as the OS, then you might want to leave additional space if you plan on adding applications to the system.  I've never tried to store /Applications on a separate volume from /System (the OS) and /Library (system-wide preferences, support files, etc.), but might be worth a shot if you have time to experiment.  \nMy only concern would be disconnects between core OS X applications and their supporting frameworks.

Evernote itself is signed out, so there definitely wouldn't be a loss if I reinstall it. \n\nA: It won't let you change it because the apps are tied to the account that purchased them.  See here for the legal details.\nBasically, only the original purchaser can update.

It doesn't prevent users from performing certain actions while logged in. That would be done with accounts and other management tools.  Posting from my phone, so I'll add hyperlinks later.  Added links. :)\nMCX - Managed Client for OS X, uses Apple's Workgroup Manager (free) for configuration management. Examples include: showing a message at login, preventing certain applications from launching, forcing restarts at certain times of the day, etc. Workgroup Manager downloads for 10.9 and 10.8.\nCasper Suite - Very robust management tool by JAMF, used widely in education and enterprise. Can do pretty much anything you can think of, but is not free.\n\nA: The main thing that will help you with this is to use standard, non-administrator, user accounts for the student logins.  This alone will keep them from installing most software, tampering with settings, etc.\nIn addition to that I would recommend Deep Freeze, which allows you to configure the Mac however you like it and then ensure that it returns to that state whenever the Mac is rebooted.  For instance, once \"frozen\" a student could change whatever they like, but upon the next reboot the Mac will look like it did when you first set it up.\n\nA: I too am gonna recommend Deep Freeze, quite a cool application that. Additionally using a MCX environment can simply a few things but why not do NetBoots and MCX so that student can log in and you limit what their rights are. \n", "Q: Printer problems I have a Canon PIXMA MX340 and when I try to print sometimes it gives me an error saying \"Support Code : 300 The printer does not respond.

Same problem.\nWhat I didn't try\nI haven't tried marking either individual albums or the artist for inclusion on my phone, just one or more playlists that include these songs.\nI haven't tried swiping to delete individual songs, because I'd first want to determine all of the playlists containing that song, and do a time-consuming before-and-after check on my phone to ensure that removing the apparently duplicated song doesn't change my playlists.\n\nA: What I would try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a current backup your iPhone via either iTunes or iCloud. \n\n*Eject the iPhone from iTunes.\n\n*iPhone Settings > General > Usage > Storage > Music > Edit > Delete\n\n*Reboot your iPhone\n\n*Connect your iPhone to iTunes and attempt to manually sync the playlists in question.\n\n\nA: Assuming the duplicated songs were purchased from iTunes, you can go to Settings > iTunes & App Store, then turn off \"Show All - Music\". This toggle shows all the songs you have purchased regardless of if it is on your device or not.\n\n\nA: What I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync your iPhone with iTunes.\n\n*In iTunes, click Summary and uncheck Manually manage music and videos OR go to Music and uncheck Sync Music.\n\n*When prompted whether you wish to proceed -- because unchecking means the current music files in your phone will be erased, which is what you want to do to resolve this problem -- click Remove and Sync.\n\n*Next, eject the phone. Check phone to see if all music files are marked by the 'cloud download' icon, which indicates you successfully removed all iTunes files from your phone.\n\n*For further inspection, find the problem files that had shown up as duplicates on your phone. For me, the problematic tracks were no longer duplicated.  If you still find duplicates on your phone, then go to iTunes, select 'Music', then select \"Show Duplicate Items\" from the View pull-down menu. Here you can delete any duplicate items. If you are using iTunes 12.01, click the 'Done' button when finished viewing file duplicates. \n\n*Restart your iPhone and connect to computer.\n\n*In iTunes, click Summary.  Now with the problem resolved, you check Manually manage music and videos. OR in iTunes, click Music and check Sync Music.\n\n\nHopefully this works, if not, it's something to do with iCloud. Try disabling that and just backup on your computer. Then do it again.\n\nA: This is a known issue actually.  I have experienced similar issues many times.  When I have an issue where my iPhone playlist contents don't match my iTunes playlist contents, I do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*For this excercise, let's say one of my Playlists is \"Steely Dan\", however iTunes and the Music app don't match, or the songs on my phone won't sort the same as they do on iTunes.  \n\n*Create another playlist called \"Steely Dan 2\".\n\n*In the original \"Steely Dan\" playlist, select all songs, click and drag to the \"Steely Dan 2\" playlist.\n\n*Delete the \"Steely Dan\" playlist.\n\n*Rename the \"Steely Dan 2\" playlist to \"Steely Dan\".\n\n*Plug in your phone and sync again.\n\nA: Try this to view if you really have duplicate items on your iTunes library:\nClick View, and than \"Show Duplicate Items\"\n\n", "Q: Mail 7.2 issues with drafts When I type a reply email multiple copies of this email get saved in drafts.\nI've read over the posts tagged mail.app and I thought I hit the jackpot with this answer by @Kyle, but when I navigate to Accounts>Mailbox Behaviours there is no option for disabling saving drafts on the server, \nor am I missing something?\n\nI am running Mail 7.2 on an MBP with OS X Mavericks 10.9.2\nWhen I type a reply email multiple copies of this email get saved in drafts, then these drafts all appear when I have View>Organize by Conversation ticked.

Break out the Terminal and attempt to discover where the critical configuration files are for Open Directory, and make sure your permissions ( ls -l ) haven't been \"bonked\" <-- (sorry for the inscrutable admin rhetioric ;-)\nAlso, if you find the config file(s) in question, you will be able to examine and edit manually ( sudo cat ____ and sudo vi ____). If these files are in an xml binary form, they can be converted with plutil -convert xml1 config.plist and converted back with pluitil -convert binary1 config.plist -- as always, copy the orginals somewhere else, back them up, and work with copies to experiment, so you can always restore them necessary.\n\nalso you can attempt to use the serveradmin (<---that's hotlinked) command line tool to attempt what the GUI is preventing you from doing. here is another good reasource, as well as here\n\nIt is difficult to diagnose/troubleshoot this without having access to the machine, so I hope I give you ideas to try that may lead to new paths to a solution.

The PATH variable is a series of colon (:) sperated directories that are searched in order to find a desire command. When a command is called, the PATH variable is read, and all the paths is contains are checked for the command in question.\nYou have 2 ways to make your program run without specifying location: either add it to a directory that's already to your PATH variable, or add its containing folder to the PATH variable.\nYou can read your current PATH variable by running:\necho $PATH\nAnd you can edit your PATH variable by following a guide such as this one\nP.S.

I quote 2 images from Google.\n\n\nLook at the tabs. They are totally different. I have just finished migrated to OS X. I always believe that OS X provides a uniform user interface to make their apps more elegant. Additionally, How to turn app's UI in the second image to look like that in the first image?\n\nA: The same Java code (mostly) runs on all OS/architectures. It has several different  APIs to draw forms/windows. Some of these APIs e.g. Swing allow you to change look and feel between emulating different widget sets. So a program can be written so that it allows the user to change the look and feel.\nThe look and feel that is supplied includes OSX (as in the top screenshot) and Windows(several forms) or Motif or GTK. The way to set this in Swing and for more information see this Oracle document Note that even the OSX Look and feel does not full match Apple's guidelines e.g. positioning of the menu in the window and not at the top of the display.\nLike any Windowing system you can always write programs that behave and look different to the expected standard. It happens that for OSX most developers stick to Apple's guidelines, but even using Apple's supplied APIs you can have a different feel between Carbon(originally Mac OS <= 9) and Cocoa programs(originally NeXT). The AppStore allows Apple to have a bit more control but I do not know if meeting display guidelines is actually checked.\n\nA: Java is simply the container and the language chosen by the programmer to describe how a picture should get drawn. Using java means that the developer ignored the standard OS X interface elements that Apple provides to developers along with user interface guideline documents. This example is precisely why java code is often seen as a second class citizen among people that expect typical Apple quality software to run on their Mac.\nThink of a restaurant. The directions to the staff could be written in french and the containers that the food gets delivered could be folded paper boxes coated with wax on the outside. It still wouldn't change what you got if one recipe was for northern italian food versus northern indian food.\nJava alone doesn't proscribe how a button looks - just the library and code to draw the GUI and in your example, different ingredients were placed in the same container with the expected different results.\n", "Q: Unable to set up iCloud email on mail.app after accidentally deleting the ~/Library/Mail/ folder I accidentally deleted the Mail folder (at /Library) that contained a few sub-folders including one called V2.

Does everyone face the same issue as I do?\niTunes v 11.1.5\nOS X 10.9.2 (Mavericks)\n\nA: MP4 is a media container format which can be encoded with many different video and audio codecs like DivX, Xvid, H.264, H.263, MPEG-4, AC3, WMA, AAC, etc. While iTunes only support few video and audio codec like MPEG-4 video codec and AAC audio codec; H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec. If the MP4 video is encode with iTunes unsupported video or audio codec, iTunes will not add and play it.\nSometimes, even if the MP4 is in the right video and audio codec that iTunes supports and we can successfully add and play MP4 in iTunes, but if the MP4 video does meet the technical specifications for iOS devices like video size, bitrates, sample rate and etc, we will fail to sync and transfer the MP4 video from iTunes to iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple TV and etc.\nA recommended solution is to convert iTunes unsupported MP4 to a more compatible MP4 video format using HandBrake.\n\nA: Video is complex!\nMP4 is just a container!\nVideo have these key elements\nContainner, Video, Audio, subtitle, Chapter info, METADATA cover pictures.\nI could tell you what iTunes or iOS need for video\nContainter must be MP4 (m4v m4a) and MOV\nVideo is H.264 (only 8bit are allowed,not 10bit, r-frame must not excied 16)\nAudio (must in AAC, ALAC, or AC3 format, if the video only have mp3 or DTS, it won't add)\nSubtitle only in SRT or Closed captions. no ass/ssa allowed.\nmost video don't come with DETADATA and cover pictures.\nonly the video from iTunes store or my Torrents.\nfor example\nhttps://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&tid=800429\n", "Q: What are the differences between terminal types supported by iTerm2?

How the TERM environment variable is initially set. Your login scripts are changing this if it gets set to screen (or you're using screen or tmux, which always set it to screen)\n2. The \"ansi\" terminal automatically scrolls when the cursor is on the bottom right of the screen. You probably don't want this.\nAs for how the TERM var is interpreted by apps, that's complicated. Most people want xterm-256color unless they're sshing to a host that doesn't support it. In order of capability and support, I'd order them:\nxterm-256color\nxterm-new\nxterm\nvt100\nI probably wouldn't use the others unless I had a really good reason to (they're carried over from the original iTerm code and may or may not work well).\nAnyway, figure out why your TERM var is getting changed to screen and that's probably the cause of your trouble.\n", "Q: Is it unsafe to put router into \"DHCP and NAT\" mode? When I was trying to get my Raspberry Pi online, in airport utility I put my router in DHCP and NAT mode and entered ports (80). Did I open up these ports to the internet? Would this be unsafe to do? \nIf I did not open up these ports to the internet, how can I open them up? \n(just to know what I should not do).\n\nA: Yes, by putting it in DHCP mode you did open up your router to the outside world. Assuming you have changed the default password on your router then when someone tried to connect to your IP Address then it would simply send them to your routers webpage. In theory you would be safe from 5 year olds but it is not recommended.\nJust for some extra information you would only want to open Port 80, Enable DHCP Mode or enable Virtual server if you were planning to host a server from inside your network that you wanted access to from the outside.\nHope this helped!\n", "Q: Macbook pro early 2013 throws contents RAM away I have a MacBook Pro early 2013, running OSX mavericks and filevault(encryption) is enabled. \nAfter a (I suspect) update, the locking behavior has been different. When the screen gets locked (manually or automatically) all running programs die. Including but not limited to spotify(while playing music), Time Machine(while in the middle of a backup, getting interrupted), Transmission(while downloading torrents). \nIt is not suspend-to-disk either, because all programs reinitialize when I unlock the macbook. Some programs do not properly save state, so this is really annoying. \nThe previous behavior was regular lock screen with a screensaver, suspend to RAM after a certain time has passed. Which worked fine for me. I do realize that Apple probably tries to prevent DMA attacks this way, but for me it is really an overkill at the cost of usability. The main reason for enabling filevault is burglary. burglars do not have the expertise to extract the encryption key from RAM anyway. \nIs there a way to re-enable the old behavior(suspend-to-ram) without disabling filevault?\nps: I am assuming this new behavior is because of filevault, I have not been able to test this, because disabling filevault is not an option for me. \n\nA: I have been able to test and this new behavior is not due to file vault. What you can do is in System Preference>Energy Saver set the display sleep to whatever you had the computer sleep at before that way the screen will turn off but all programs will keep going. Next go to System Preference>Security & Privacy and set \"Require Password\" to Immediately. Other than changing any shortcuts you have to lock the screen to turning the screen off then your computer will basically go to sleep keeping all programs running but you still need a password to get back in.

I don't want anyone going to mydomain.com and seeing my site unless they are joined to my VPN.\nRight now I can type in the local IP to see the site, but I prefer to use my domain name instead.\n\nA: Because you want to be able to access the domain only from your local network (which includes the VPN) then you didn't need to get the static IP or domain name. Those are only needed if you want to allow a user to connect from outside the network. For your purpose you just need to set up a domain on your intranet and I found a tutorial at http://www.edugeek.net/forums/internet-related-filtering-firewall/111965-domain-name-intranet-use.html that should work. If it doesn't work then you will be stuck with using the IP Address and out however much you spent on the domain and static IP. However on the bright side you are smart enough not to open up port 80 to the rest of the internet. Good luck!\n", "Q: Search / filter by genre in iTunes Currently the only filters for search in iTunes are by song, album, artist and composer. Is there a way to search by genre in iTunes?\n\nA: In the current version of iTunes, it works when you uncheck \"Search entire iTunes library\" in the search bar. (To get there you click the spotlight-type icon in the iTunes search bar.) I had the same problem, and that worked for me!\n\nA: Seems like you cannot search by genre in iTunes, however you can perform a search request like this in Spotlight: kind:music genre:jazz which will reveal all for tracks that have genre set to jazz in their tags.\n\nA: Assuming you are using iTunes 11 then there is a bar under the window that shows what is currently playing and one of the buttons should say Genre and will usually be 4th from the left. If you click on that then it should sort your library by genre. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Just type genre name (or part of name) in search box in iTunes and it's find all results.\n(Doesn't work in MiniPlayer mode, only in full mode)\nDid you forget to press Return for actual search in library?\n\n\nA: On the left hand side: select songs to show the grid view. Add columns if needed. Go to View in the menu bar, select column browser.\n\nA: I got this to work in iTunes 12.4.1.6: If I have Genre visible as a column, then I can search for a genre in the search box, and it limits the visible songs to those that are in that genre. But I have to make the Genre column visible first; searching by genre doesn't work otherwise.\n", "Q: Late 2011 iMac wont boot after Mavericks install I am not very tech savvy so please answer in lamans terms.\nI recently updated my iMac to Mavericks via App Store.

There is a folder called Documents (and other folders beside that) in iFile\nI tried but can't find the physical location with iFunbox or iTools.\nHow can I find the physical location of that folder?\n\nA: When using a system that doesn't know how to follow POSIX symbolic links (like iFunbox), then you're going to need to know the actual location of the directory. When using iFile, it'll appear to be located at /var/mobile/Documents/, but in reality, /var is a symbolic link to /private/var/. So the answer to your question is: The Documents folder is located at /private/var/mobile/Documents/.\n\nA: If you are looking for the files that have been downloaded to your device and are accessible via the “Files” application try going to /var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/1A268C0D-94CD-4503-9A09-6E08E12387AB/File Provider Storage/Downloads\n\nA: Download Apple file conduit \"2\" from cydia, Once you do you will be able to see everything that you want such as /var in Ifunbox in the raw system files section\n", "Q: Is it possible to submit not sandboxed app to the Mac App Store I have an AppleScript Cocoa application that does a lot of shell scripts like kill or chflags. Is there any way I can try to send it on review to MAS and get it approved?\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nDisallowed types of applications revealed by Apple include new apps\n  that are not sandboxed (as of June 1, 2012). At WWDC 2013, Apple\n  announced that this rule no longer applied, and that so-called\n  \"temporary exceptions\" may be used when the app has a reason not to be\n  sandboxed.\n\nHowever, Apple OS X Developer website states that sandboxing is required for Mac App Store.\n\nA: According to this it is possible but with caveat.\nApp Sandbox Temporary Exception Entitlements\n\nNote: This chapter describes property list keys specific to the OS X\n  implementation of App Sandbox. They are not available in iOS.\nA temporary exception entitlement permits your OS X app to perform\n  certain operations otherwise disallowed by App Sandbox.\nIf you need to request a temporary exception entitlement, use Apple’s\n  bug reporting system to let Apple know what’s not working for you.\n  Apple considers feature requests as it develops the OS X platform.\nNote: If you request a temporary-exception entitlement, be sure to\n  follow the guidance regarding entitlements provided on the iTunes\n  Connect website. In particular, use the Review Notes field in iTunes\n  Connect to explain why your app needs the exception, and include the\n  bug number.\nTo request a temporary exception entitlement for a target in an OS X\n  Xcode project, add it to the target’s .entitlements property list file\n  using the Xcode property list editor.\n\n", "Q: How to mount raw disk images? I'd like to mount a raw dump of a disk, e. g. like those created by dd? Is there something like a loop device in OS X?\n\nA: The hdiutil command given above is correct, however, newer Mac SSDs have a 4096 byte block size and hdiutil defaults to 512 for disk images so if you attempt to mount a 4096 byte block size image it will look like nonsense to the system.\nAdding -blocksize 4096 to the command will let you work with an image created from a newer Mac:\nhdiutil attach -blocksize 4096 -noverify -nomount diskimage.img\n\n\nA: For those encountering the same problem:\nhdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage -nomount filename\n\nthen mount it as you like.\nSource:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/174909/mount-block-file-on-osx\n\nA: This is funny because it's actually really really simple. Rename it to a .dmg extension, as a DMG is a raw image too.\nIn contrast to the above solution, this will work on dd rips of entire drives in addition to partitions.\n\nA: You can create a disk image of the disk using Disk Utility. Select the disk or the disk's partition in the list on the left, then File → New → Disk Image from <disk1>.\nOnce the image is created, you can mount it like any other volume and if you selected read/write you can read/write to the image like a mounted volume.

I'm planning to release an iPhone app next week. I have read that Apple pays out 45 days after the end of month (if threshold is reached). My developer account is linked to an address in India if that makes any difference.\nSo, if I reach the threshold in May, is it safe to assume I will get paid in the beginning of July?\n\nA: Developers get paid within 45 days of the last day of the month. For example, the amount you earned in March should be paid to you before mid-May. For my case in March, 2015, I got paid on April 30.\nAlso note that the minimum threshold depends on the currency and country pair Apple set. If you decide to get paid in the pair Apple set (e.g. HKD in Hong Kong or JPY in Japan), it's $10 USD or equivalent. If not, it's $150 USD.\nThis information is from Apple's documentation in iTunes Connect.\n\nWhen will I be paid?\nPayments are made within 45 days of the last day of the month in which\n  book purchases were made. To receive payment, you must have provided\n  all required banking and tax information and documentation, as well as\n  meeting the minimum payment threshold.\nIf your bank and bank account currency is listed in this table, you\n  must exceed a minimum payment threshold of $10 USD. All other bank\n  countries and bank account currencies must exceed a minimum payment\n  threshold of $150 USD.\n\n\nA: As far as I can tell from https://discussions.apple.com/message/23256906#23256906 you don't get paid for a month after you hit the threshold for payment of $150. Hope this helps!\n\nA: So the reality is that Apple, unlike other app stores, uses a special fiscal payment calendar where months don't start on the 1st and don't end 30/31 days later.\nInstead of using standard calendar months, Apple sets up its own fiscal calendar and uses it to pay developers. Apple’s fiscal calendar is divided into quarters, each with one 35-day fiscal month and two 28-day fiscal months. Furthermore the fiscal calendar is only 364 days, so every 5 years or so Apple has to add an extra week to the December fiscal month to account for leap days and the 365th day of each year.\nHence, based on our expertise with Apple Payments, we at Braavo Capital have created a Apple Payments Calendar tool that tells you exactly when to expect your Apple payments.\n", "Q: Automating ffmpeg using Automator Service I often use ffmpeg off the command line to convert video files into mp4 on my Mac (running Mavericks). Do note, however, that I am NOT re-encoding my videos; am just changing the container from an avi or an mkv to an mp4. The exact command I run on Terminal is as follows:\n/Users/Amit/Documents/Scripts/ffmpeg -i /input.mkv -c:v copy -c:a copy /output.mp4\nAs can be seen, this involves a lot of typing (for example, the entire path for ffmpeg and the source and target videos) and since I do a lot of such conversions, it would be great to have some Automator help here.\nSo, how can one go about creating a Finder Service that automates this activity? I would prefer a Finder Service instead of a standalone app or menu item.\n\nA: You could also add a function like this to a shell configuration file like ~/.bash_profile:\nmp4() {\n  for f; do\n    ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c copy \"${f%.*}.mp4\"\n  done\n}\n\nThen you can just run mp4 input.mkv.\nYou can replace /Users/Amit/Documents/Scripts/ffmpeg with just ffmpeg if you move ffmpeg somewhere like /usr/bin or if you add PATH=~/Documents/Scripts:$PATH to ~/.bash_profile.\n\nA: Automator Service\nYou can use Automator to create a new service or droplet:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator.app\n\n*Create a new service with service receives files or folders in any application\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script action\n\n*Set Pass input: to as arguments\n\n*Within the script, replace echo with the script below.\n\n*Save your workflow as a service.\n\n\nShell Script\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    /Users/Amit/Documents/Scripts/ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c:v copy -c:a copy \"${f%.*}.mp4\"\ndone\n\n\nTo learn more about using Automator, see Apple's Mac Basics: Automator.\n", "Q: Apple Loops Copyright Let's say I used some Apple Loops in a 5 min contest video that's being sold to the contest host (So he can show a reference for this years contest).

The screen is back to normal. I don't move anything at all. If it was a loose connector then putting the display to sleep would presumably not help.\nHere are some other sites describing the same issue:\nhttp://www.geekinheels.com/2008/05/02/apple-replaced-my-macbook-pro-for-free.html\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1633312\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1627678?threadID=1627678&tstart=0\nBut they're fairly old and I have been going through them and I don't see anything definitive.

Probably not possible through Apple anymore since a 2008 MacBook Pro would be considered vintage...\nFor the keyboard/trackpad issue, you might try reseating the flex cables underneath the top case.  iFixit.com has great guides for opening up your Mac. You open your computer at your own risk. :)  If that doesn't change anything, could be a bad top case.  The keyboard assembly and top case are separate on the 2008, non-unibody MacBook Pro, so then it's up to component isolation.\nSummary: Don't spend any money fixing this computer (unless you reeeeeally want to).  Like an older car, it can be difficult to find parts for older computers, but there are places that have them.  My advice would be to use it until 'till you lose it, then purchase a new computer.\n", "Q: How can I deactivate Find my iPhone's Erase iPhone? My iPhone 4s has been stolen and I have activated \"Erase iPhone\" through the iCloud, but I've found out that this disables Find My iPhone too.\nHow can I disable \"Erase iPhone\" to avoid deactivation of Find My Iphone?\n\nA: Apple doesn't provide a way for you to withdraw an erase command from iCloud. Theoretically, if it hasn't been withdrawn, an engineer for Apple could go in and remove it from the queue assuming:\n\n\n*\n\n*They could verify you were really you\n\n*You figured out how to convince them to do this\n\n\nAs for whether you can still track the device after an erase is sent, that depends on the version of iOS on the device. \nIf you have iOS 7 or later - the erase action does not stop tracking or remove the activation lock preventing a thief or someone who finds / buys it from being able to use the device. It will still show your lock message and you can still track the device. Problem solved!\nIf you are on iOS 6 or earlier, you are correct that you will have lost the chance to track the device once it connects and receives the wipe command. If it ever connects to Apple's servers, the wipe will happen and the device will be erased and you should get an email if/when that happens.\n\nA: I recently misplaced my MacBook Pro and used iCloud to locate which didn't help because it was off. Anyhow I used iCloud to erase. Shortly thereafter I was given back my MacBook and couldn't figure out how to stop or cancel the erase.\nAfter much research I followed some very simple directions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchased an external hard drive to back up my MacBook.\n\n*Turned of the WiFi in the house.\n\n*Went into all the Apple devices and removed the MacBook from the device list.\n\n*Signed out of \"Find My Device\" on all devices.\n\n*Turned on the MacBook and turned off the WiFi and did a back up of the MacBook's hard drive onto the external hard drive.\n\n*Turned on the WiFi on the MacBook and kept my fingers crossed.\n\n\nIt did not erase my macbook. Whew that was simple too.\n\nA: As per apple's instructions, if after the erase command has been sent you remove the device from your find my phone list of devices all pending commands (including remote erase command)are removed.\nCheck this page \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201472\nit states;\nIf your missing device is off or offline, you can still put it in Lost Mode, lock it, or remotely erase it.

I moved the files:\ncom.apple.finder.plist\ncom.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\nout of \n~/Library/preferences\n\nAnd then \"turned it off and on again\", ie. restarted. This fixed the issue for me.\nMy hunch from looking at the crash log was that it was somehow choking on Finder itself (the logs in Console.app reported the key found to be null was \"dateModified\"), and that some sort of corrupt settings were to blame.\n\nA: I've found out that removing the color tags (labels) to the files and folders displayed in the FileOpen Finder dialog solves the problem.\nThis worked fine before Mavericks...\n", "Q: Video (.mp4) playing in QuickTime but not in Finder Quick Look or iTunes I just used ffmpeg to convert a video file's container from .mkv to mp4 (just changed the container; didn't re-encode). The resulting mp4 vid plays well on QuickTime and am very pleased with the result. However, it wouldn't play in either Quick Look or iTunes.\nIn Quick Look as well as in iTunes, I am able to just move the play pointer up and down the slider manually but it just shows stills from the video. This is very frustrating as I was hoping to be able to add the video to my iTunes library! Any reason why this would happen?\nOh and if it helps, the codecs are H.264/AC3. Should that matter? A similar question elsewhere was closed with the accepted answer suggesting that the video be re-encoded. I really, really don't want to do down that road if there's ANY way to skirt that. I just want to change the container which is way faster than a full-blown re-encoding!\n\nA: Conversion by QuickTime Player\nQuickTime Player may be swiftly converting the file on opening using OS X's new AVFoundation. This would explain why it can play the file but not QuickLook or iTunes.\n\nIt is likely the movie is not in an ideal format for QuickTime Player on OS X 10.9, thus the conversion. With OS X 10.9, Apple dropped native support for many video formats and containers. Where possible legacy formats are converted on opening.\nSupported MPEG-4\nYou may have a valid MPEG-4 container but the contents are not natively supported without conversion.\nHave you confirmed the movie's encoding using the Finder's Get Info panel?\n\nRe-Encoding\nIt is highly likely you will need to re-encode the movie, as suggested in MP4 movie does play in QuickTime but not in iTunes, if you want iTunes for playback.\nThis questions suggests a slightly different set of flags for ffmpeg to gain iTunes support, Convert a bunch of MKV files to MP4 to read them in iTunes:\n./ffmpeg -i <filename>.mkv -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 384k -strict -2 <filename>.mp4\n\nAlternatives to iTunes\nIf you wish to avoid re-encoding to gain iTunes support, consider looking for alternatives to iTunes. VLC and XMBC are both worthy alternatives; they both handle a wide range of video formats.\n\nA: AAC vs AC-3\nIn my experience, about half the time mkv files are encoded with AAC audio, and half the time with AC-3, and yes this matters. Quicktime will play the AAC and AC-3 formats, but iTunes and iOS media player will not. If the audio in the mkv file was AC-3 and you merely rewrapped it in an mp4 container, it will still have AC-3 encoding on the audio. What you need to do is transcode the audio to AAC when you run that ffmpeg command like this:\n ffmpeg -loglevel panic -i \"original.mkv\" -vcodec copy -c:a aac -strict -2 -ab 160k -ac 2 -ar 48k new.file.with.transcoded.audio.in.acc.mp4 \n\n\nmp4 atom\nffmpeg is a wonderful and fast utility, but it does not care that you are an iTunes user. iTunes and iOS media player are very finicky about decoding video if the mp4 atom is in a place it doesn't like, namely, anywhere except near the beginning of the file. Quicktime also complains sometimes...\n\n...but is definitely better about playing unoptimized video. There's no telling where ffmpeg placed it, but likely its in the same place whomever encoded the original mkv left it.\n\nSubler\nSubler is a utility designed specifically for encoding subtitles, but it also will do exactly what you need it to do in this case. It will not only rewrap, and not transcode, the video to a friendly format, it will transcode the audio from AC-3 to AAC if necessary, and it will optimize the location of the mpeg-4 atom in the resulting file for iTunes friendly use. It uses a friendly drag and drop paradigm. Download Subler, unzip into your Applications folder and launch Subler. Type command-n to begin, and drag your mkv file into the window, and choose from the simple available options to result in a video mp4 or m4v file with identical video but transcoded audio. Make sure to mark the check box under Subler menu/Preferences to transcode the audio.\n\nz264\nz264 is a cool bash script designed to specifically solve the video issues that Mac and iTunes and iOS users face. Here's exactly what it does and how to make it work for you, if you're not too turned off by the command line.\n\ncheck file for AVC encoding and flv, wmv, or mkv wrapper and rewrap in mp4 container otherwise, if not already am mp4, transcode to AVC mp4\nz264 has several dependencies (mediainfo, rmtrash, ffmpeg, SublerCLI, and HandBrakeCLI)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*copy and paste script text into a text file, uncomment binary install section (remove #), save anywhere\n\n*open Terminal.app\nchmod +x z264\n\n\n*run once\n./z264\n\n\n*recomment binary section (replace #) after dependencies install into /usr/local/bin/\n\n*create ramdisk called 'Two' using command in ramdisk section\ndiskutil quiet erasevolume HFS+ 'Two' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://4194304`\n\n\n*double-check command definitions (locations of dependencies), and correct locations (to \"/usr/local/bin/\")\nchange line 231 to read:  mediainfo=\"/usr/local/bin/mediainfo\"\nchange line 236 to read:  rmtrash=\"/usr/local/bin/rmtrash\"\nchange line 238 to read:  ffmpeg=\"/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg\"\nchange line 239 to read:  SublerCLI=\"/usr/local/bin/SublerCLI\"\nchange line 262 to read:  mediainfo=\"/usr/local/bin/mediainfo\"\nchange line 263 to read:  rmtrash=\"/usr/local/bin/rmtrash\"\nchange line 265 to read:  HandBrakeCLI=\"/usr/local/bin/HandBrakeCLI\"\n\n\n*save as z264 in /usr/local/bin/\n\n*use Terminal to call z264 on single file, directory of files, or your entire drive\nz264 directory.full.of.mixed.video.filetypes/*\n\nz264 will examine everything, but will only touch avi, flv, mpg, mpeg, wmv, vob, mkv and mp4 video files, copying video and audio streams and rewrapping if possible, transcoding just the audio if necessary, and transcoding only what video is necessary, and leave you with iTunes friendly, atom optimized mp4 files, leaving the originals in your Trash. It makes reasonably intelligent decisions for you about how to transcode files based on how you set its HandBrake variables (set at lines 312-333).\nminor issues: does not yet count how many background processes it spawns, meaning if there are a lot of transcodes, it will take awhile for them to complete, but they will complete. You also need a lot of memory (8GB is ok). Snow Leopard users will need to install purge command from xcode developer tools.\n\nA: For newcomers who might encounter the same issue.

If the screenshot is right, the User ID should be 502, and the Group should always be \"staff\" on normal accounts.\nIt's possible there's something else wrong as well, but this'll solve at least part of the problem. One thing to check (after fixing the User ID) is to use the Finder's Get Info to check the home folder -- in the Sharing & Permissions section, make sure the correct user account is listed. If it isn't, do not try to fix it in the Finder; there's a way to fix home folder permissions in Recovery mode that's much less likely to break anything.\n\nA: You can also try to restore your system from a Time Machine backup, taken before the incident.\n", "Q: How to set a new desktop image when creating a new desktop in Mission Control?

When opening certain files (e.g. xlsx, pdf) in my encfs volume, I get an error \"X is damaged and can't be opened.\" as well as a suggestion to move it to trash.  However, when I copy that file elsewhere (i.e. not on the encfs volume), it appears to work just fine.  Why is this?\nEDIT: I looked online and found a post involving disabling GateKeeper.  It did the trick.  In essence, you go into \"Security Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere\".\nI understand that the solution works, but I would like to know why it works.  Thanks in advance.\nEDIT 2: Also, if someone could tag my post with encfs, it'd be very appreciated.\n\nA: I've found the answer here (for BoxCryptor):\n\nUnder special circumstances, Mac OS X adds the extended attribute 'com.apple.quarantine' to a file which was e.g. downloaded from the internet. This can also happen to files within the BoxCryptor Folder. If an encrypted file has this extended attribute set, you receive the \"is damaged\" error message when trying to open the plaintext file in the BoxCryptor Volume.\n\nAlso try this, more secure workaround:\n\nx) Open Terminal (Applications -> Utilities)\ny) Run the following command (substitute the path):\n$ xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/encfs/mount/point\n\n\nA: @apmouse is correct: you can repair the file with xattr. But you have to do that repeatedly – every time you save a file it will have the quarantine flag added back to it.\nAs you pointed out, there's a less safe but more convenient alternative: disable GateKeeper.\n\n\nI understand that the solution works, but I would like to know why it works. Thanks in advance.\n\nThe first thing to note is that if you go into Keynote and choose File → Open, you can open the \"damaged\" file without any issues. This implies that it is actually Finder that is intervening to prevent opening the file.\nThe error message \"_____ is damaged and can't be opened\" is actually a signature error (see here – about 3/4ths of the way down), meaning that GateKeeper can't verify a valid signature. Signature verification is supposed to be applied to executables, and I still haven't figured out why it's bugging out in this situation.\nI tried compiling the osxfuse's sample loopback file system and putting the same \"damaged\" file on there and it opens just fine. So I think this bug is specific to encfs – not to osxfuse in general.\nFor what it's worth, there is a ticket open on the osxfuse project for this exact problem. If you're having this problem, post your details on that ticket.\nHope this helps...\n\nA: I don't know why apple don't appear to have a simple way to say \"this volume is safe\", but the problem is fairly easy to solve for encfs. Please find below a script I use for mounting encfs volumes; it automatically solves the attribute problem, and also helps with remembering to close volumes. It could be extended by reading encfs dir and mount point from the command line, but I prefer not to because typos might create security risks. It should be relatively easily adapted to other mount mechanisms, such as boxcryptor. It works for me, but you rely on your own expertise in deciding whether to use it for yourself. Very specifically, I am not a security expert, and am not qualified to judge whether it opens any security holes (especially while it is running, and especially on shared machines).\n#!/bin/bash\n# script to mount encrypted volume\n\nENCFSDIR=<encfs dir>\nMOUNTPOINT=<mount point>\nSAFELOC=<somewhere outside mounted volume>\n\nencfs $ENCFSDIR $MOUNTPOINT\n\ncd $MOUNTPOINT\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine .\nMY_PROMPT='SECRET: '\necho 'noscecrets to finish'\nwhile :\ndo\n  echo -n \"$MY_PROMPT\"\n  read line\n  if [ 'nosecrets' == \"$line\" ] ; then\n    break\n  fi\n  eval \"$line\"\ndone\n\n\\# and clean up\ncd $SAFELOC\numount $MOUNTPOINT\n\nexit 0\n\n\nA: I think I have a more persistent workaround for this rather than a command you need to run each time.  As I just mentioned on the bug report upstream:\n\nI thought to myself, OS X uses system users and system daemons for all\n  kinds of jobs, perhaps the kernel is expecting to be able to do some\n  work as another user, or as root, to these files, and marking them as\n  damaged when that doesn't work.\nSo I marked my sshfs binary as setuid, and I added the -o\n  allow_other mount option to my sshfs command line, and ... I appear\n  to be able to open and edit documents reliably on the mounted volume. \n  I will continue to experiment and follow up if it stops working.\nI am of course concerned about a setuid root binary lying around, but\n  it seems better than the option of running a daemon which requires\n  root privileges on the file server side of things to get NFS or SMB.\n  :)\n\nGiven that allow_other is a FUSE mount option and not specific to sshfs, I believe that this workaround would work for encfs as well.  It would be great to know if someone tried it and it worked!\n\nA: Thanks @Glyph , from what I can tell it appears to be working after following your steps.   I followed these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I had to add a group which I belong to the osxfuse admin group, otherwise the allow_other would fail with operation not supported.  \nsysctl -w osxfuse.tunables.admin_group=12\n\n\n*Then used the -o allow_other to encfs\nI've only tried it for a bit, but the reproduceable failure case I had appears to now be working.\n", "Q: 1 and 2 keys to change tabs in Safari (like in Opera) In Opera browser 1 and 2 keys can be used to change between tabs. Is it possible to set up this shortcut in Safari?

I believe that you would add this shortcut from Automator however I am not on my computer right now so I think that will work but I haven't tested this specific shortcut. If that dosent work then there is always the option of \"⌘+`/⌘+Shift+' \" to go to the next or previous tab.

I stumbled this article explaining how mounting RAM disk can improve OS X performance up to 40× which of course is just a a hyperbole.\nMy question is whether the suggestion made by them valid for modern MacBook that has been powered with SSD and an adequate 4 GB RAM? Does creating RAM disk actually prolong the SSD life?\nPersonally, I think OS X has done a great job managing the resources, but I would like hear more from experienced user who actually know how RAM disk works and affect OS X performance.\n\nA: Yes - anything you do to reduce the number of writes to an SSD will prolong \"the life of the drive\". Also yes - the memory (RAM disk) is an order of magnitude faster (between 10 to 1000 times as fast based on what exact workload you want to measure) than just the SSD. \nWhether you ever get to a point where your SSD fails due to write exhaustion or if something else breaks first (or you sell the device) is hard to estimate even for a statistical group of 1000 machines used in a proscribed manner.\nI wouldn't worry about trying to extend my SSD life and instead worry about making the Mac you have work well for the specific tasks you need. The OS already caches much of the filesystem to RAM, so you'll need a very specific workload to do a better job at caching than the OS already does for free. Also, a repair part is not that expensive should you actually wear out that one part before you're done with that computer. Yes, try not to have un-necessary writes and thrashing an SSD, but since Apple designs the SSD to be covered under AppleCare for three years - it's not in their interest to have lots of SSD needing replacement due to them picking a part that won't last long enough in practice.\n", "Q: How to refer to the bottom in Pages I'm writing a document in Pages, but I want to create a footnote at the bottom of the page.

When issuing the following command:\nsshfs -ovolname=Z user@host:/somewhere/on/the/Y /Z\n\nThe mounting is done correctly.  Using the terminal, everything works as expected.  However, finder displays the volume name as Y, as if the presence of the volname= option didn't matter.  Has anyone else encountered this?\n\nA: The options go at the end of the command, so in your case:\nsshfs user@host:/somewhere/on/the/Y /Z -o volname=Z\n\nI just had a similar problem and this fixes it for me!\n\nA: You need a space between the -o and the volname:\nsshfs -o volname=Z user@host:/somewhere/on/the/Y /Z\n        ^\n\n\nA: Struggling with this issue myself, I discovered that I needed to add the -o local option:\nsshfs user@host:/somewhere/on/the/Y /Z -o volname=Z -o local\n\nBeware that the OSXFUSE maintainers advise against this option, though, as it might invoke unwanted side-effects:\n\nThis option marks the volume being mounted as \"local\". By default, osxfuse volumes are marked as \"nonlocal\", which technically isn't necessarily the same as a \"server\" or \"network\" volume, but is treated as such by the Finder in some cases. For example, the Finder may not show \"connected servers\" on the Desktop or in the sidebar in some cases. If you use this option, you can get around this \"limitation\". However, wait! Don't be too tempted and think local is a magic pill that will solve all your problems. In fact, it may mess things up more than you realize. The operating system can be more aggressive in dealing with \"local\" volumes (a .Trashes. directory will be created, for one). You could run into mysterious problems with Disk Arbitration and other system components. I don't know (and possibly can't know--Mac OS X isn't all open source!) the side effects of using this option. Therefore, treat this as experimental and use with caution.

With a utility like Carbon Copy Cloner (which you can use for free for 30 days, I think), and an external interface for your new hard drive (USB, Firewire, etc.), you can clone--i.e. make a bit-for-bit copy of your operating system and installed programs--the drive that's currently in your computer. Then, when you install the new hard drive, the computer should see it as the boot disk and everything should pick up exactly where you left off--just with a lot more storage.\n\nA: The simplest method to install things is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the new drive to a USB to SATA adapter\n\n*Partition and format the \"external\" drive using Disk Utility\n\n*Download the OS X installer you want and install the OS on to the \"external\"\n\n*When you boot to the external, let migration assistant copy everything to the \"external\"\n\n\nTest that the \"external\" works properly, then and only then, make a final backup of the internal drive and swap the hardware.\nThe benefit of this method is not only that you keep your system unbroken while you test the OS and migration, you can know if you have a working drive and OS without needing to do any \"wrench work\".\nYou could use Disk Utility to simply clone the existing drive onto the SSD, but I prefer a clean install to let the OS place the OS files in the proper place and who knows what errors have crept into the existing system over time. Migration is really solid (it wasn't as robust 5 years or more back, and people rightly wanted to clone a working system more regularly then.) You could also use SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to do the duplication, but again - I really prefer a piecemeal, reinstall as it works best for me time and time again.\n\nA: This can be done with Time Machine. NOTE this will not make an exact bit-for-bit copy of your current harddrive, but will copy over all users' files, settings, applications, etc. (including /usr/local), as well as the operating system files themselves. \n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine does not backup cache directories, files that have been moved to the trash, etc. I have also found it does not backup the saved state of open applications nor Office product keys.\n\n\nThese steps are broadly from: https://www.imore.com/how-back-up-mac-time-machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your backup harddrive and make a current Time Machine backup by going to System Preferences -> Time Machine -> 'Show Time Machine in menu bar'. Then go to the menu bar icon and select 'Back Up Now'.\n\n\n*\n\n*You should be backing up already (right?!?), so this should not take long.\n\n*If you have not made a backup already, enable Time Machine and then start the backup.\n\n\n*Once the back up is complete, swap out your internal harddrive for the new one (following all safety instructions).\n\n*Power on your computer and hold the Command and R keys to enter the recovery partition (this may take a few minutes).\n\n*Select 'Disk Utilities' and ensure that the volume on your new harddrive is formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n\n*\n\n*If it is not, reformat it. This will delete all files on the new harddrive, but there should be nothing on your new harddrive so this should not be a probelm.\n\n\n*Now quit 'Disk Utilities' to go back to the list of utilities.\n\n*Select 'Restore from Time Machine Backup' from the Mac OS Utilities and click Continue.\n\n*Select your Time Machine back-up source and click Continue.\n\n*Select your latest back up and click Continue.\n\n*Select your new hard drive as the Destination.\n\n*This will restore over all backed up files to your new harddrive.\n\nA: You need to download the Mavericks Installer, then create a USB Install.\nSince you already have Mavericks installed, you need to use following simple process.\nOpen Apple Store.\nGo to Purchase Tab\n\nIt will show you Mavericks Download...\nIt will ask you to confirm since you already have Mavericks.\n\nOnce downloaded to NOT run the Installer.\n", "Q: packages installed with Homebrew not found after restore I got a new Macbook Pro and restored from the backup, all of my packages are in still there and the path is still correct, but when I type a command that was installed on the previous system it returns an error. Take for example pstree\npstree\n-bash: pstree: command not found\n\nSomeone elsewhere on the internet suggested reinstalling them, but I have way too many packages installed to go thru them one at a time.\nThe computer is running Mavericks. I used migration assistant to restore from a time machine backup and brew doctor says my system is ready to brew.\n\nA: From your answer above, it looks like you want to relink all your kegs, which is already answered here:\nIs there a quick way to relink my homebrew kegs?\nIn one line:\nbrew list -1 | while read line; do brew unlink $line; brew link $line; done\n\nA: It is documented that Homebrew fails after TimeMachine recovery a on a new Mac or making a Migration as Homebrew builds binaries for your specific machine:\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/583\nThe official solution is to uninstall and reinstall homebrew. Don´t cry it's very easy with this line that remove and restore again all your 'formulae'\nbrew bundle dump && brew uninstall --force $(brew list); brew bundle\n\nA: I actually found a simple, and somewhat inelegant solution: I concatenated brew list into a file calledbrewback.txt then I wrote and executed the following script\n    #! /bin/sh\n    cat brewback.txt | xargs -L1 brew unlink ;\n    cat brewback.txt | xargs -L1 brew link\n    echo \"Done\" exit\n\nI wanted to do both arguments in the same step, as in unlink then link the first program; unlink then link the second, etc. and if someone can describe how in a comment that would be greatly appreciated, then I will mark this problem as solved.\n", "Q: How to make spotlight index files shared over AFP I'm sharing a local folder on a 10.8.5 Mac Mini server via AFP. The share is set to allow a certain user group to write to it. When users in this group place files in the directory, they are owned by that user.  The problem is that spotlight will not index these files.  If I chown one of the files to the local admin user, it immediately gets indexed by spotlight.\n# Observe the initial file ownerships:\n$ ls -el /Shared/mds-test-doc.pdf\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 otheruser  wheel  36279 May  7 15:23 /Shared/mds-test-doc.pdf\n 0: group:somegroup inherited allow read,write,execute,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\n# Observe that mdfind doesn't see it (or any other files containing a period\n# character within that directory)\n$ mdfind -count -onlyin /Shared '.'\n0\n# Change the file's owner to adminuser:\n$ sudo chown adminuser /Shared/mds-test-doc.pdf\n# Sanity check the new ownerships:\n$ ls -el /Shared/mds-test-doc.pdf\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 adminuser  wheel  36279 May  7 15:23 /Shared/mds-test-doc.pdf\n 0: group:somegroup inherited allow read,write,execute,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\n# Now mdfind sees it:\n$ mdfind -count -onlyin /Shared '.'\n1\n# Remove the -count to confirm it's the expected file:\n$ mdfind -onlyin /Shared '.'\n/Shared/mds-test-doc.pdf\n\nSo as you see, just re-owning the files allows them to be indexed (instantly I might add). Obviously one fix would be simply recursively owning all the folder contents.  Many web solutions I've found suggest doing this or making the Repair Disk Permissions tools to do it for you.  Such a solution isn't ideal because:\n\n\n*\n\n*the files are supposed to be owned by otheruser\n\n*a recursive chown only fixes files at that moment, so it would need to be executed periodically (launchd/cron job) to keep the files up-to-date and indexed\n\n\nIs there a better way of fixing this?  Maybe I'm missing a server or spotlight setting somewhere?\n\nA: I found (what seems to be) a good solution after messing around and observing another AFP share that is working correctly.  Turns out that the working folder has ACLs to allow spotlight indexing:\n$ ls -led /Shared\\ Items/Public/\ndrwxrwxr-x+ 19 root  admin  646 May  6 12:47 /Shared Items/Public/\n 0: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit\n\nNew directories created inside a directory with this ACL will also inherit it. Files created inside the directory inherit a similar ACL: user:_spotlight inherited allow read,execute.  As it turns out, applying the allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit ACL to a regular file results in the file getting the simplified ACL (allow read,execute).  So my solution was to add the inherit ACL recursively to the shared directory:\n$ chmod -R +a 'user:_spotlight allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit' /Shared\n\nThis solution worked perfectly. Now all my share content shows up in spotlight searches regardless of who owns them.\n", "Q: How can I get the list of allowed users for Remote Management via Terminal? I want to use a command line tool to get the list of allowed users for Remote Management (ARD). I was able to enable ARD using kickstart, but I'm having trouble finding how you get the information, not set it.\nIs there a com.apple.Sharing or com.apple.ARD somewhere that I'm missing?\ndefaults /Library/Preferences/com.apple.ARDAgent\n\ndoesn't seem to give me the info I need.\nOk, did find\ndefaults /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement\n\nbut that only gave me whether all local users are allowed for ARD. That is useful, but I want a little bit more. Do I need to use dscl perhaps to find ARD groups?\n\nA: I had a bit of a look at my Server and desktop Mac and it would seem that the permissions are stored in the local Open Directory database. The command dscl . -list /Users dsAttrTypeNative:naprivs when run by an admin will give you a list of users who have any privileges set for remote management.\n\nA: @k3vmo in Tony's post.\nReading naprivs as shown in the command suggested by Tony (dscl . -list /Users dsAttrTypeNative:naprivs) does work on Sierra.\nThe Sharing preference \"Remote Login\" is different from the \"Remote Management\" setting, which is what the naprivs attribute reports on.\nIf you are interested in listing users with \"Remote Login\" access (i.e. users with SSH access), use the command:\nsudo dscl . -read /Groups/com.apple.access_ssh/ | grep GroupMembership | cut -d: -f2\n\nRemote Login = ssh access\nRemote Management = screensharing/VNC access\n", "Q: Does Apple's Open Source License permit static linking of a library? I have a closed-source project that I'm thinking of linking against one of Apple's open source libs, modified. As I understand it, I should publish my derived work under the same license stating the changes made.\nBut can I link it against my project statically, or is it limited to dynamic linking only?\n\nA: According to APSL you are allowed to modify and use their library for profit uses as long as you A)Leave the apple copyright code intact and B)you include the modified code. You don't have to make your entire project open-source but the modified library does have to be open-source. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Frequent GPU Panics I'm just praying that I don't need to replace my logic board for this problem; I don't have applecare.  \nRandomly my computer shuts itself off, sometimes just the screen, sometimes the entire system restarts.

Check out this link http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4088?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US. Basically check with your local Genius Bar and update your software. It is a hardware problem so there is no way to fix it through software other than running the graphics off the CPU only. Hope this helps!\n\nA: The last loaded kext before the panic was com.bresink.driver.bresinkx86mlnitoring.  Do you have any Bresnik software on your computer?  Try uninstalling it and see if that helps.  \nIf it doesn't, I agree with Appleguy1999: the backtrace of the panic shows GPU kexts, so it could be a GPU issue if an OS X reinstall doesn't work (to reinstall all the systems kexts). So if removing the Bresnik stuff and reinstalling your OS doesn't help, definitely visit the Genius Bar.  Appointments are always free; repairs not necessarily so.\n\nA: You may be happy to hear that Apple has acknowledged this hardware related issue and there's a Macbook Pro Repair Extension program: http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nAs part of the program you will receive a free repair should those issues appear (probably a logicboard/mainboard swap)\nAffected are the following models: \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch Early 2011) \n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2011)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) \n\n*MacBook Pro (17-inch Early\n2011) \n\n*MacBook Pro (17-inch Late 2011)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15 inch,\nEarly 2013)\n\n", "Q: Automator Newbie question I'm running my Mac under 10.9.2 and have about 75 scanned Tiff files which need to be processed through the OCR app, TesseractGUI 0.3. It works very well for me but balks at .tiff extensions and Alpha enabled files. In small batches I've been using Preview to Export, deleting the second \"f\" and unchecking the Alpha. This manual file adjustment works well.\nTime to put Automator to use. I've gone through Apple's \"Basic Tutorial\" but there's not enough detail to find my way. I've been having a devil of a time getting inexplicable running errors.\nI've conceived of a routine where whatever is put in a \"Process\" folder on the desktop will automatically delete the second \"f\" in the extension and uncheck the Alpha. Then move the revised file to a \"Processed\" folder also on the desktop. That way I'd still have my unchanged originals as well as files TesseractGUI will accept.\nAppreciate some guidance. \n\nA: You can run a Terminal command to batch edit the extensions and move the files to the processed folder:\n\ncd /path/to/folder\n\nwhere /path/to/folder is the folder containing the originals. \n\nfor file in *.tiff; do cp \"$file\" \"${file%tiff}tif\"; mv *.tif ~/Desktop/Processed; done\n\nThis command will leave the originals in the original folder, and move the \"processed (tif)\" files to the \"Processed\" folder. The script is a bit sloppy regarding syntax, but would easily get the job done. I don't know how to automate unchecking \"Alpha.\"\nNote that you can incorporate Shell commands into an Automator routine as well, under Library > Utilities > Run Shell Script. \n", "Q: How do I set up IPv6 on my Airport Extreme? I am trying to set up IPv6 on my Airport Extreme. According to AT&T / BellSouth, my network is IPv6 ready.\nNetwork Setup\nI currently have two parts to my network setup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Westell Model 6200 modem (IPv6 ready)\n\n*AirPort Extreme (fifth generation)\n\n*AirPort Express (the last model that plugs directly into the wall)\n\n\nMy modem is plugged directly into the wall via a DSL cable, and then my router is connected to the modem via an Ethernet cord.\nSetting Up IPv6\n\nI tried setting this up on my own in 2012, but the interface of AirPort Utility has changed drastically since then, and I also recall losing all Internet capabilities when I \"set it up\" last time, so I want to make sure I do it correctly this time.\nUpon choose a manual configuration, I'm greeted with different options about whether I want to choose a Native or Tunnel Mode, whether I want to enable IPv6 Connection Sharing, and more.\n\nI'm not sure which of these options is the \"preferred\" method, or what is required of me to properly configure AirPort Extreme to use IPv6.\nI am willing to plug and play different configuration options to see what works best.\n\nA: *\n\n*In the \"Configure IPv6\" menu, select \"Automatic\".\n\n*In the \"IPv6 Mode\" menu, choose \"Native\".\n\n\nThat should be all that's needed. The device should be able to autodetect the rest of its settings.\nIf that doesn't work, then you may need to check the settings with your ISP.\nSource / more info: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5098\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I came across it looking for the same information - especially what the 'Enable IPv6 Connection Sharing' option did. So, I decided to update this thread on that information:\nA reddit post from ~2016 asks what the 'Enable IPv6 Connection Sharing' is for. The answer there (from an Apple Certified-marked responder) says:\n\nIt allows IPv6 communication alongside IPv4...\n\nI used an online IPv6 test pointed to by my ISP. With 'Enable IPv6 Connection Sharing' selected, I was able to pass the tests. When that box was unchecked, the test said that I didn't have an IPv6 address at all.\nNote: I had the other two options selected as advised by @bennettp's answer. This gave me an IPv6 address and DNS servers from my ISP.\n", "Q: OSX Server.App Mail Server Not Starting I'm having an issue that I've had before, but I've never come up with a solution.

I can't find any useful information in my logs. The last time this happened, I had to start fresh with a new server, but the server has grown to the point that this is no longer feasible. Any ideas?\nUPDATE:\nPer the answer below:\nWhen I try to telnet, I get connection refused errors. Also, running ps ax didn't show the master line.\nMy /var/log/mail.log looks like this when cycling the server:\nMay  7 23:07:23 mail.thoughtspacedesigns.com servermgrd[113]: servermgr_swupdate[INF]: Verifying Software Update catalog configuration.\nMay  7 23:07:23 mail.thoughtspacedesigns.com servermgrd[113]: --Module servermgr_swupdate's response has retain count of 4.\n\nThat's the only thing that popped this time. Other times I haven't been getting any response.\nAlso, in server.app is a \"mail server log\" in the logs section. When I cycle the switch, the only thing that appears is this:\nMay 07 23:07:21 master: Info: Dovecot v2.2.5 starting up (core dumps disabled)\n\n\nA: The first thing I'd try is seeing if you can talk to the SMTP server.\nTelnet to port 25 on the server, on the command line of the server it would be telnet locahost 25 and the server should reply\nTrying ::1...\nConnected to localhost.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n220 <servername> ESMTP Postfix\n\n(If you do connect then just type \"quit\" followed by return to exit.)\nIf not then check to see if master is running with ps ax | grep master which should give a line like\n29   ??  Ss     0:05.48 master -c /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix\n\nThen have a close look at /var/log/mail.log and try sending yourself some mail at your server address and see what happens.\nIf the telnet doesn't work and there is no 'master' process working then postfix is borked. You need to figure out why. If you run:\nmaster -d -v -v -c /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix\n\nyou will be able to watch the postfix 'master' process start up and then in anther terminal window try the telnet trick again. This should give you some more useful information.\n\nA: This fixed it for me...for macOS Server 5 \n\nFollow this article: Setting Logging Levels for Mail Services on OS X Server 5 \nAnd set each below.\nsudo serveradmin settings mail:postfix:log_level = \"info\"\nsudo serveradmin settings mail:postfix:spam_log_level = “info”\nsudo serveradmin settings mail:imap:log_level = \"info\"\nsudo serveradmin settings mail:postfix:log_rolling_days_enabled = yes\nsudo serveradmin settings mail:postfix:log_rolling_days = 3\n\n\nA: I figured out the issue. It turns out that this is actually a common issue that afflicts  OSX Server. Postfix will sometimes corrupt itself when modifying mail server settings. In order to get the server to come back online, I had to replace the /Library/Server/Mail/Config folder with the latest working version. I have Crashplan installed on that computer, so I was able to easily restore the folder back to a previous date with a few clicks, and voila, the server works again.\nFor those of you not as lucky as me (no backup solution), you can try deleting server.app and reinstalling. The network engineers over at CyberLynk told me this would also repair that folder without destroying any pertinent data (such as email accounts).\n", "Q: How does this complex BASH shell script work?

I used Textmate and saved the result as 'linc.sh' so I got syntax highlighting. Then some judicious reformatting/prettying and I had this :\n\nOnce you've done that you will have a shell script and you can see that it is using shell variables and expansion to build the options before running a command then using grep, awk and sed to process to output and make it more readable before repeating the whole thing with another command. There are also some shell functions in there.\nGet a good book on bash programming and with the help of that and the bash manual pages you'll understand it.\n(BTW - this is one of the reasons I do as much of my system administration in IPython, makes for much easier programming and readable code.)\n", "Q: Can I test my iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 apps on an iPad mini retina I'm new to the iOS world.

I did a manual backup of my 4s to itunes then deleted my 5s contents and settings and restored it using my 4s backup.

What did I do wrong or is there no way to restore the 5s to v.7.0.4 using my 4s backup?\n\nA: What happened was correct - the backup only contains your data (apps, contacts, messages, etc) not the operating system version. As your 5S had 7.1.1 installed, restoring your backup kept that iOS version but restored your data.\nIf you'd prefer to have iOS 7.0.4 on your 5S you'll need to install that version first (manually, using iTunes), then restore your 4S backup.

In that case, a Mini will be more than sufficient for development using Xcode. Even the basic 2.5Ghz dual-core i5 has a fast enough CPU, but if you have enough money I'd go for one of the i7 models - they're quad core and that could make a bit of a difference for big compiles, etc. One thing to be aware of - it's not possible to upgrade the CPU, so buy the fastest you can afford. RAM and storage you can upgrade later on, when you have money.\nTwo recommendations I'd make\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have enough RAM. It's probably cheaper to buy this from a third-party rather than Apple and I'd recommend at least 8GB, 16GB if you can afford it. It's easy to install yourself (just remove the bottom cover and slot it in) and won't void your warranty.\n\n*Get an SSD. Again, it's cheaper to go third-party than buying from Apple. Installation is a bit more complex than installing the RAM but it's still straightforward if you're comfortable taking a computer apart (see the various guides from iFixit). Doing it yourself will, in theory, void your warranty, so be careful!\n\n\nI think you'll be just fine using a Mac Mini for software development - I'm perfectly happy using my i7 2012 model for development.\n", "Q: What extra hardware do I have to buy if Mac Mini is my first Apple product? I don't own any Apple product and am thinking of buying the upcoming Mac Mini. Now considering that this Mac Mini will be my first Apple product, what hardware I may have buy if I want to use Mac Mini for software development?\nAnd please be specific if I need to buy that from Apple strictly.\nFor example, I have to buy a monitor, and as far as I know, I can buy any Monitor with DVI (as there is a HDMI to DVI cable provided) or HDMI port.\n\nA: The only things you absolutely need that isn't already included are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The monitor that you have already identified.\n\n*A keyboard; a Mac specific one would make sense, but any PC USB keyboard will do you just need to be careful to use the right settings as the layout will be subtly different\n\n*A pointing device of some sort.  If you are coming from PCs, you may hate Apple mice (I do), but again any PC mouse will work just fine.  Having said that, the Magic Trackpad is fantastic.  I use one on my iMac and do not use a mouse ever on a Mac any more.\n\n\nThings you don't not need but are highly recommended would include:\n\n\n*\n\n*A backup drive!  Backup your stuff!  Make it big (2x your internal drive at least) and make it fast (USB 3 or Thunderbolt if you have too much money)\n\n\nThings which you might fancy but aren't really needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*A headset/headphones of some sort (iPhones headphones with the 3 pin jack work fine)\n\n*An external DVD reader/writer (any brand, USB)\n\n*USB cup warmers (any brand)\n\n*Novelty stickers (any brand, except Microsoft Plays for sure! and Windows license keys)\n\n\nA: Regarding your choice of monitor - you're not limited to the HDMI port. You can also use the Thunderbolt port on the Mac Mini for the monitor. This will connect any monitor compatible with DisplayPort or Thunderbolt.\nFor example I use the Dell U2412M monitors which are great for development with its 1920x1200 resolution. It connects directly to the DisplayPort port without requiring any adapters. For development I would really consider having at least two monitors.\n", "Q: 4s backup from 3gs can I please ask, if it's alright if I do the backup from 3gs to iphone 4s? I mean, does it affect something on the iphone 4s? I read somewhere that the users who did this backup had a problems with iphone (they don't have a siri there for example and the iphone 4s worked after backup just as their old 3gs without the new 4s tricks etc.)\nThank you very very much for any answer. I'll be really grateful.\n\nA: Backups are compatible with later model devices (but not the other way around - ie, you can't restore a 4S onto a 3GS usually). You can safely restore a backup made of an iPhone 3GS onto an iPhone 4S without problem.\nI (and several people I know) have done this multiple times without problem. For example, my current iPhone 5 has data on it that was originally on a 3GS, which was restored onto a 4S and then onto the 5. Siri worked fine on the 4S and works fine on the 5 (along with everything else).\n", "Q: How to re-install an OS on Mac My friend has a Mac book pro. I'm afraid I know nothing else about it.\nFor reasons unknown, and I dare not ask, she decided to rub a magnet over it, beside the touch pad. \nShe heard a strange noise, and powered it off. Then, when turning on, she just saw a question mark on the screen.\nI'm guessing she's either wiped or destroyed the SSD. However, she's asked me to restore it and I know nothing about this. \nWhilst my research shows me that files may have been synced to the Cloud (the cloud? Surely they mean to a server, using the technologies which have been available for years). But it doesn't state if the OS is backed up.\nThe computer didn't come with any discs. \nOn a Windows PC (which I have little experience with), I know that some times the OS isn't included but the serial number is, so you can get an ISO and re-install it that way.\nOther PC's include the installation files on a partitioned hard drive.\nMy question is, is there a uniformed way Apple supply the OS with Mac products (unlike PC's)? If so, what is it?\n\nA: The question mark comes up when the start up files have been messed up.\nI do not know if you can repair the Magnet damage but you can try to restore.\nMac's have a Restore function build in (or online)\nTo access start computer and hold cmd-r\nthat will bring up the restore menu.\nDepending on your computer model you might have the Internet restore option.\nThe sound you heard was the forced computer shut down.\n\nA: Restore OSX using OSX Recovery. To do so, hold CMD+R at the boot chime. If the recovery partition has been wiped as well, you will need to restore using Internet Recovery: CMD+ OPT+ R at the chime. \nFrom either, select \"Reinstall OSX\" from the pane you are presented with. \n", "Q: How to open the next message in the currently selected mailbox in mail.app When viewing a message in a separate window in Apple Mail (Mountain Lion), how can I open the next message in the list with a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: I found navigating email in a thread incredibly frustrating especially for long email that have hundreds of lines of quoted text, and was trying to find the answer to this.\nSo here goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*first highlight an email in a thread: click next to the title, the email borders should be highlighted\n\n*use the right/left arrow buttons to go to the next/previous email in this thread\n\n\nA: There is only one way to do that as far I know.\nWhile in Open message window to see next message use the option cmd N\n\nA: There is no keyboard shortcut for opening the Next Message (as of Monterey 12.4). It is also not possible to create a shortcut using preferences, as the Mail app has no action available for this.\nNot what you wanted, but you can archive or move the email you are reading, so that it gets out of the way and you will have the next email in view.\nArchive this message: ctrl+cmd+A\n", "Q: VPN with two mac users I have two users accounts on my computer, one needs to stay connected to a VPN while the other account, both being logged in, is not supposed to use the VPN. OS X 10.9 seems to only give me global VPN access or none. Does anyone know a solution?\n\nA: I have a very dirty work around. So I hope someone will come up with a better solution.\nWhat I did is setup a Virtual Box virtual machine with some minimalistic Linux that can do VPN. Once the virtual machine is connected the user can use the VPN inside the machine (but other users not). Since I needed to use some apps in the host system I finally set up a proxy in the virtual machine that would forward my VPN users data.\nAs I said dirty...\nUPDATE 2022:\nAs I see this answer still is popular - nowadays it is possible to achieve this through Docker as well. Try using docker-vpn.\n\nA: This is not feasible without virtual machines. Networks exist on a system level and not the user level. Even with per-app VPN, you’re constantly juggling and testing and losing control of things in practice.\nIt was not feasable in the past, but with Apple hypervisor, you can do lightweight ARM VM that scale well or choose a dedicated cluster of low cost Unix devices. They are now economical for this sort of scale out of apps and network customization you contemplate with two accounts on macOS.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/\n\n*https://raspberrytips.com/install-vmware-esxi-raspberry-pi/\n\n*https://williamlam.com/2020/10/vsan-witness-using-raspberry-pi-4-esxi-arm-fling.html\n", "Q: Terminal Equivalent of Finder Sort Order One of the features I like about the Finder is that it sorts numbers \"correctly\", i.e - a file named \"Episode 10\" will come after \"Episode 9\" in a list, rather than after \"Episode 1\".\nHowever, I haven't been able to find a way to replicate this ordering on the command line with any of the basic tools such as ls, sort and so-on, though I may have just missed or misunderstood an option.\nIs it possible to mimic the Finder's alphabetic sort order to sort numbers by value when encountered? If so, is there a means of doing this that is cross-platform (even partially)?\n\nA: GNU ls has the rather useful -v option that will do exactly what you want. Unfortunately there's no similar option for OS X's BSD-based ls. \nA quick solution is to do the following:\n$ ls | sort -n -k1.5\n\nThat sorts the output starting at the 5th character of the first field.\nThe same question was asked at StackOverflow and there are a number of other possible solutions listed there (some are Linux-specific though).\n", "Q: How do I get my HP PHotosmart 7520 setup to scan to mac? I have my HP Photosmart wireless printer setup successfully to print from my MacBook, but cannot get the scan to PC function to work.  Help!\n\nA: Try opening Preview and choosing File -> Import from Scanner\n\nA: I have an HP ColorSmart 309g, a later model, but it is a similar general design with both inkjet printing and scanning functionality.\nThe only way that I have been able to get a scan from the printer to OS X other than sneakernet (i.e. scanning to a memory card or thumb drive, then plugging the card or drive into the computer and copying the files over) is through the web interface.\nIf your printer has a built-in web server like mine, you can visit the IP address of the printer on your local network in any web browser.  Along with diagnostics and ink level info, you should then see a button or menu for scanning.  You just put what you want to scan on the glass or into the feeder, then click the \"scan\" button and the scanned image appears as a web page, from which you can download it.\n\nA: You will need to choose and dowload the full package from HP depending on your OS.\n\nThis download package contains the full software solution for OS X\n  10.9 Mavericks including all necessary software and drivers.\n\nThat should solve the problem.\n", "Q: Black background on any app window Suddenly my computer (iMac 27\" late 2012) screen appears like the screenshot I am attaching (happens with all apps)\nCould it be just software issue that can be fixed or looks like a hw problem?\n\n\nA: Looks like graphic distortion.  If resetting NVRAM and resetting SMC don't resolve the issue (and you don't have any other symptoms, e.g. crashing applications), visit the Genius Bar.\nP.S.  If you feel up to the challenge, run Apple Hardware Test and see what you find.  Then bring your results to your Genius Bar appointment.\n\nA: To rule out software:\n* Create another user account and see if it happens there\n* If it still happens, reinstall Mac OS X (have a good backup in case things go wrong)\nAssuming you have already tried rebooting, I am curious what happens if you power off the iMac and let it remain powered off for a few hours, then try again (if at first it works, and then you get the black backgrounds after a while, that would indicate to me a heat-related issue).\n", "Q: Why isn't my launchctl.plst firing on startup?

For many events in my calendar there are 50-100 instances of the same appointment or birthday.\nIs there a way to downsize my identity file, or make my current one something like .old and start fresh with a new one?\n\nA: Before deciding to split the database / identity, have you tried just rebuilding it?\nI believe Outlook never really deletes things, just marks them as deleted until you run maintenance on the database files that outlook uses inside your identity folder.\nFire up the Microsoft Database Utility (search using spotlight or find it in the Office folder), select the identity and press the rebuild button.\n\nA: This can be accomplished using the \"Microsoft Database Utility\"...\n\n\n*\n\n*Open MS Outlook while holding option\n\n*You should see a window similar to this:\n\n\n*Click the \"+\" sign in the lower left corner to create a new, blank, identity\n\n\n*Once you've created and named the new identity you can set it to be the default (the one that opens when Outlook launches) by selecting it, clicking the gear icon and choosing \"Set as default\"\n\nNow, if you open Outlook it will be empty.  You can add your email account/s by clicking Outlook > Preferences > Accounts and entering the appropriate information.\nAlternately, you can duplicate your original Outlook identity and clean out the original or duplicate, deleting email accounts and removing \"On my computer\" folders, until it's empty, then re-adding accounts and info as needed.  To create a duplicate identity:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, browse to ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities\n\n*Select your current identity (by default it's named Main Identity), right click on it and choose \"Duplicate\" from the contextual menu\n\n*Once it's finished copying you should have a second identity folder named \"Main Identity Copy\" or similar.

When I boot it, the screen is black (no backlight: Apple logo doesn't light up). I do hear the startup chime, and it actually does proceed to boot, but the screen stays dark. After a while, I can hear ticks as I adjust the volume, I can adjust the keyboard backlighting, etc. After it boots, the fans stay on at full speed.\nI did a PRAM and SMC reset, both to no effect. After lots of fiddling with plugging and unplugging an HDMI cable to an external monitor, I eventually got the screen to turn on. Most things seem functional, besides it being a bit sluggish and the fans still stay at full speed (and there seems to be a LOT of battery drain). I'm using gfxCardStatus and I notice it isn't really able to switch to the discrete GPU anymore.\nDoes anyone recognize this issue? I suspect it's a hardware issue (broken GPU? broken connection to GPU?), are there any more tests I can do?\nI notice in the system report at Graphics/Displays, it only gives me something about the integrated \"Intel HD Graphics 4000\". Can anyone else with the same model rMBP verify whether this is normal?\n\nA: Apple has launched MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues which can be found here\n\nApple has determined that a small percentage of MacBook Pro systems may exhibit distorted video, no video, or unexpected system restarts. These MacBook Pro systems were sold between February 2011 and December 2013.\nApple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will repair affected MacBook Pro systems, free of charge.\n\n\nA: I see that you did a PRAM reset, but it doesn't hurt to try resetting PRAM continuously 4 to 6 times in a row quickly. \nIf you have remote access enabled or remote login, I would then boot and try to get logged into the system that way to better diagnose the issue.\nNext I would try booting with various options such as with the shift key to disable extensions. \nNext I would try to load the Apple's Hardware Test utility by holding down the d key on boot.\nNext I would try booting from the System installer SD or DVD holding down the c or option keys, and in the options screen that you can't see, just pushing the right arrow once and guessing at the choice.\nAnd if I had access to an external monitor to try, I would, again to attempt to get more diagnostic info from the system.\nIt does sound like the symptoms have a definite cause, such as a dead clock battery, or a bad graphics card, or even, unlikely though, a virus. If under warranty, contact Apple if you think it is a hardware issue. If not under warranty and you think it is a hardware issue, take it to your nearest Apple Store and ask to see the Apple Genius.\n\nA: I also have a mid-2012 15\" rMBP and have seen similar problems intermittently for the pst couple weeks.\nI only notice it on startup. On the bad startups, the screen stays black and the computer won't start.  The issue persists on reboot, smc reset, pram reset for an hour or two and then goes away. \nToday it started again. After I got it booted in recovery, I noticed in syslog that the processor was thermal throttling. I listened for the fan and was surprised to not hear it, at all. \nThis model may be prone to a bad temp sensor or fan controller issue. \nI put an ice pack on the machine and it eventually booted but is running extemely slowly. Hopefully if I leave it for an hour it will come around. \nI've noticed a couple other electrical oddities recently: right USB port doesn't always work, so I think I might need a new logic board. \n\nA: This seems clearly GPU issue. Previously all 2011 model MBPs had the same issue and same symptoms. I am a victim myself. Take it to the authorized service center immediately. If you are out of warranty then it may be expensive to replace the logic board. I have sworn that I will not buy another Apple Mwith dual graphics.\n\nA: Same thing happened to my late 2013 rMBP. The computer was on, the display wasn't. I got my display replaced by Apple for free under warranty.\n\nA: I have had a similar issue - heard the start up chime but had a black screen. \nI shone a touch through the Apple logo on the back and saw that it was going to the login screen just without the screen lit. I was able to log in using the light from my torch and I didn't have the problem again. \nI know it sound silly it worked for me, I have a mid 2012 mbp also\n", "Q: Searching for apps that will run on an original iPhone – excluding apps that will not run on iOS 3.1.3 Apps for an old iPhone\nI'd like to seek and find apps that will work on iOS 3.1.3 – without wasting time browsing apps that will not. And without a jailbreak. \nApple's App Store appears to lack this capability – no filtering out of incompatible apps, even when using the Store on the handset. \nI found one answer … additional answers will be greatly appreciated. \nThanks\nBackground\nVintApps 3.1.3 might have been ideal. I never tried it. \nThere's an iOS category at MacUpdate but the filters are nothing like what's required. \nNote\nI'll use my first generation iPhone for as long as it continues to work as well as it does. So please, no answers that suggest an alternative iPhone. \n\nA: Seeking an alternative to VintApps 3.1.3 led me to older Apps – MacRumors Forums (2013-11-05), there's a link to an Apple Club article: \nFinding iOS Apps Compatible with Older Devices\nFirst impressions: useful, US-oriented. \nAdapted from what's there: I could use a Google UK search, such as the one below, as a basis for finding compatible apps in the UK App Store: \nhttps://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Aitunes.apple.com%2Fgb%2F%20%22requires%20ios%202.0%7C2.1%7C2.2%7C3.0%7C3.1%22\n… for example, a search for carshare-related apps.\n\nStill, I'd prefer an app – ideally for OS X – with a smart user interface. \n\nA: AppTimeMachine, \nBlackout Store, \n3Store \nAll of these require jailbreak...\nOr, you can use this guy's list:\nhttp://www.ifans.com/forums/threads/apps-for-idevices-running-ios-3-1-3.392703/\n", "Q: Using external microphone in Bootcamp I have an implemented microphone in my headphones (earbuds), Microphone doesn't work at all.. \nAfter searching for sometime i found out its a known problem, Bootcamp doesn't recognize external microhphones\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried this microphone on OS X using same laptop ( and it works perfectly )\n\n*I'm using Macbook Air 2013\n\n\nHowever i solved it by using Parallels Desktop 9 as an alternative virtual machine than bootcamp and it works good, But thats not the solution I'm looking for, I want to get this external mic to work in bootcamp windows 7\n\nA: The short answer is sorry, but there seem to be no driver to support the external input in the headset. My solution that works is to get a cheap USB to headset audio adapter that support the 4 pin 3,5mm jack of the headsets. Here is one that works, but you can surely find others in your local market:\nhttps://www.wentronic.com/de-en/index/artikel/USB-2-0-sound-card-audio-adapter-headset-adapter-96291\n\nA: If you run Parallels or VmWare Fusion, your original Mac will load all drivers and on top of that you will run your Windows environment.\nThere's not really much you can check except clicking the Apple icon (strong text) on the left-top of your Mac and check the About this Mac followed by More Info...\nAfter that click Audio and check the manufacturer. In my case this is Apple Inc. as image below describes. I cannot find any other Windows driver for this. I don't know if any Mac has a different kind of built-in mic, but it's worth checking it out.\n\nAs you might have noticed already, the drivers for the built-in Microphone is only available for OS X. That's the reason why it doesn't work.\n", "Q: Apple Lightning to Micro USB I am in the process of wiring up some iPad carts but they bought keyboards for the iPads that need to be charged by Micro USB.\nThe cart is already wired for Apple's Lightning and was wondering, is there anything aside from re-wiring the cart to go from the male Lightning connector to Micro USB or maybe the male Lightning to female USB so I can plug in the Micro USB cable?\n\nA: The only official Lightning / Micro USB adapter sold by Apple is the Lightning to Micro USB adapter as shown below:\n\nThere doesn't seem to be an adapter for the reverse of this.\n", "Q: How can I troubleshoot an Epson Perfection 1260 scanner that won't play nice with Mavericks? I'm trying to get an Epson Perfection 1260 scanner working with Mavericks. \nWhen I connect the scanner to my Mac it shows up fine in Printers & Scanners in System Preferences. It also shows up in Image Capture, and quite often it will allow me to do an overview scan. However, at some point the (usually green) light on the front of the scanner turns red, and the scanner disappears completely from my Mac.\nHow should I start troubleshooting this?\n\nA: The red light may mean that the scanner has detected an internal error, so start at that end.  First, try the scanner on another system if possible. If it works on another system, then the issue could be the USB connection or the software.\nIt is not unheard of (though rare) to have a bad USB cable, so if you have a spare, swap it for the current one and see if that helps.\nThere were sporadic disconnects in the early versions of Mavericks, so a system update may have solved your problem.  If not, start troubleshooting by making sure your software is up to date, then remove all other peripherals from your system and connect the scanner directly to your Mac ( no hubs ).  Try each USB port in turn, as there are differences in their internal connections.\nI doubt that it would make any difference, but you can download and try a copy of vuescan, (hamrick.com) which uses a different driver.\n", "Q: Sparrow for Mac resets after quitting Every time I quit and relaunch my Sparrow email client I am prompted with the setup screen. All my accounts and preferences are reset. It's as if I just installed the app for the first time again. \nI'm not exactly sure how I got the app into this state but reinstalling it does not fix the problem. I have also tried searching my Mac for and deleting all files and folder that contain sparrow in the name, and then reinstalling but still no luck. \nI've emailed Sparrow support quite some time ago and no response. Has anyone ever encountered this problem? \n\nA: Sparrow's development was halted quite a while ago, and as OS X has developed, Sparrow hasn't kept up.\nMost notably is the addition of Containers for app's data and I speculate that this is causing some problem with some code in Sparrow. Obviously, this is speculation as I haven't seen Sparrow's source code, but I don't think it's something that you can fix yourself—it's most probably a bug in Sparrow's code.\n", "Q: Chrome notifications not appearing on both monitors (dual monitor)? When using Chrome notifications on OS X, how can I set the notifications to appear across two monitors simultaneously?\nI'm using a Macbook Pro and a Thunderbolt Display, and Chrome notifications - for example, a notification of a new message on Meta Chat - only display on the Macbook Pro. I would like the notifications to display on both monitors.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going into the 'Settings' of Chrome Notifications, which only allows \nusers to change what sites can send them notifications.\n\n*Apple's Notification Center looks to control Apple's native notifications, rather than Chrome notifications.\n\nA: This is currently not possible.\nGoogle Chrome uses its own code for displaying notifications which Keyboard Maestro doesn't seem to be able to interact with. There appears to be no AppleScript for even detecting notifications and Google Chrome seems to refuse to provide the content of the message to Keyboard Maestro for any sort of macro.\nAlso, sending Chrome notifications to Growl also doesn't help since Growl still can't show notifications on multiple displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I show Growl notifications on both displays?\n\nA: multiple Chrome instances with multiple profiles\nI didn't originally specify, but the idea is you have one instance of Chrome running on one display, and another running on another, and you are logged into the same Google account from both. In theory, this should give you the exact functionality you want.

In launchd, you can change the path of the log files using StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath in .plist file, but when I used it to output a log returned by the process, the resultant log files didn't add a timestamp and hence I cannot tell when each line is written nor when the process is run to begin with.\nSo is it feasible to add the timestamp information to the log files? The minimum requirement is month, day, hour, minute, and second.\n\nA: The keys you mention don't redirect log files, they redirect the standard output/error streams. It is the responsibility of the program writing to those streams to add timestamp information.\n\nA: You could use the ts command from moreutils which is available from homebrew or MacPorts. One reason to do this is if you dont want to encapsulate everything in a script and still want to use StandardErrorPath and StandardOutPath:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n  <string>/bin/zsh</string>\n  <string>-c</string>\n  <string>/usr/local/opt/yabai/bin/yabai -V 2&gt; &gt;(/usr/local/opt/moreutils/bin/ts -m '[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S] -' 1&gt;&amp;2) 1&gt; &gt;(/usr/local/opt/moreutits -m '[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S] -')</string>\n</array>\n\nthat third <string> is an xml-escaped representation of the below command:\n/usr/local/opt/yabai/bin/yabai -V \\\n  2> >(/usr/local/opt/moreutils/bin/ts -m '[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S] -' 1>&2) \\\n  1> >(/usr/local/opt/moreutils/bin/ts -m '[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S] -')\n\nWhat the above command does is 3-fold:\n\n*\n\n*First, it runs the yabai command with verbose output enabled: /usr/local/opt/yabai/bin/yabai -V\n\n*Second, it redirects stderr (fd 2) into the stdin of the ts program which has formatting specified: 2> >(ts -m '[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S] -' 1>&2)  Since ts is going to output to stdout we need to make sure that we redirect that process's stdout to stderr, which is done by 1>&2.\n\n*Finally, we send stdout to another instance of ts which outputs to stdout: 1> >(/usr/local/opt/moreutils/bin/ts -m '[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S] -')\nBy doing it this way you can preserve launchd's StandardErrorPath and StandardOutputPath output functionality.  There's also the zpty module of zsh if you want to install less stuff on your machine.\n\nA: You could include the date command in ProgramArguments before your program path in your launchd .plist:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/bin/bash</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>date; program-path-here</string>\n</array>\nIt's the equivalent of running /bin/bash -c \"date; program-path-here\"\n", "Q: Adding text around a circle with pages How do I add text around a circle I'm using for a logo?

I'm testing a mobile website and when changing javascript it doesn't seem to refresh it, even when using the \"reload\" in the menu or when appending a random variable, for example \"?test=123\" to the end of the url.\nI also force quite the app but still no luck.\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: Per your comment that \"a way to delete the browser cache completely\" may be suitable, you can go to the Chrome menu → Settings → Privacy and clear the cache.\n\nA: IMO it sounds like client side caching is not your problem. It's more likely you're running into a server side cache problem. If you're using a CDN (cloudflare, cloudfront, etc.) to serve assets, make absolutely sure that you're expiring assets appropriately.\nBarring that, I recommend using Chrome in Incognito mode which does not persist a long lived client cache.\n\nA: I'm aware that this is an old question, but perhaps this will help others.\nIn the browser you're using, tap the address bar, and type:\njavascript:location.reload(true);\nor\ndata:text/html,<script>location.reload(true);</script>\nThis has been tested on iPhone XS, in Google Chrome.\n\nA: Yep. Maybe first you should clean up Chrome browser cache and some temporary files, and see how it goes.\n", "Q: Is Macintosh System Software 1.0 (Classic MacOS) Free? Since Macintosh System Softwsre 1.0 is extremely old, has Apple made it free to download? If so, is there a link to download it from?\nI am just curious to try and run it in an hardware emulator and get a feel for the old operating system...\n\nA: The answer to your question is kind of complex. Here are the bullet points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple has never open-sourced any version of the operating system that ran on Macs prior to Mac OS X.\n\n*Prior to System 7.1 (as it was called at the time), Apple did provide versions of the System software free of charge. System 7.5.3 (and an updater to System 7.5.5) were also eventually made available free of charge, but that didn't happen until years after the fact. None of these versions are open-source.\n\n*On non-PowerPC systems, the System software depends heavily on the Mac ROMs. These have never been made available free of charge. Also keep in mind that the first version of the System software to run on PowerPC systems was System 7.1.2, so everything before then would need a ROM, and you can't get those.\n\n\nA: Back in the day, many MacOS versions were not sold, but available for free - if you installed it on hardware that shipped with MacOS X (that was in the days of clones that shipped legally with some MacOS version). I think that was true with versions up to 7.5.3, possibly 7.5.5 I've never seen any version before 8.0 for sale. You certainly cannot buy MacOS 1.0 for money.\nYou'd have to dig out an old license agreement and read it very carefully to see what is actually allowed. Current versions for example allow running the software on \"Apple branded computers\", while slightly older versions allowed running on \"Apple labeled computers\" (probably changed because some joker put an Apple sticker on a Dell computer and claimed it was \"Apple labeled\"). I would say if someone installs it on something that can be called an \"Apple branded computer\" in 50 years time when Macs are long forgotten, it's probably legal. \nPractically, Apple most likely doesn't mind as long as you don't make loud claims that they cannot ignore. \n\nA: software resources\nIf you're interested in older software, Gamba's site is a excellent resource, as well as Jag's House. You might also register at the Applefritter forums, and the 68k Macintosh Liberation Army forums,\nor Vintage Mac Software Library and the abandonware site Macintosh Garden.\n\nCheck out mess.org\nA sister project to MAME is MESS which emulates just about everything. \n\nrecommended hardware\nIf you are very serious, I'd recommend getting a B&W G3 Powermac with the \"Revision 2\" motherboard (Apple Part No. 820-1049-A), and run OS X 10.5 Leopard. The Disk Utility that came with that version of OS X allows you to initially prepare scsi disks for use with older systems and older macs.\n\nThe \"Revision 2\" units fixed the hard drive controller problem with an improved (UDMA-33) IDE controller that supported the standard IDE master/slave two-drive arrangement. This controller worked flawlessly with any drive within the 28-bit LBA constraint. Most Rev. 2 units shipped with a hard disk bracket designed for two drives (in fact Rev. 1 can hold up to three drives side-by-side, while Rev. 2 can hold up to four drives in two stacks, each with two drives) and also included a slightly updated version of the Rage 128 graphics card. The easiest way to tell if the unit is a Rev.2 is by looking at the CMD chip located on the logic board. The CMD chip on Rev. 1 logic boards is PCI646U2 and on Rev. 2 logic boards is 646U2-402.\n\n\nemulation in browser\nemulation in javascript with JSMESS\n\nA: Apple provides a long list of older software, incl. System 6, 7, and 8 here:\narchive.org: http://www.info.apple.com/support/oldersoftwarelist.html\n\nA: No, System 1.0 is not open source and not in the public domain. Apple provided it with the purchase of a Macintosh. The system software was not available for separate purchase.\nHistory\nWith MacOS 1.0 you are probably referring to the first version of Apple's operating system. \nIn 1984, with the release of the first Macintosh (128K), the system was actually not called MacOS but was just Mac System Software.\nApple has called it MacOS since version 7.6. \nYou can read (and learn) a lot about it on Wikipedia. \nEmulation\nAbout an emulator of the first Mac system. There is one you can use : mini vMac\n\n\n*\n\n*It will require a ROM to run vMac\n\n*and finally a disk image of the system\nUnzip everything, start the mini vMac, it will load the ROM and you'll get a blinking floppy with a question mark because it couldn't find the system. To solve it just drag the system image over vMac and the system will start ! \n", "Q: Jailbroken lockscreen crash I have the iPod touch 4th generation running jailbroken iOS 6.1.6.\nThe iPod is working fine except for when I lock it. When I try to wake it back up again, it doesn't come on. If I leave it for like a minute after trying to turn it on, it restarts the whole iPod for some reason.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Boot into Safe Mode by holding the volume up button on boot. If the problem doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it's a substrate tweak causing the problem. Still in Safe Mode, go to Cydia and uninstall any lock screen related tweaks until the problem is fixed.\n", "Q: Flagged/Starred Messages not working in Apple Mail I just setup two accounts in Apple Mail for the first time, and am having absolutely no luck getting Flagged messages to work, in addition the Starred message folders aren't working.\nI'm using Mavericks v10.9.2...\nFirst off, it's two Gmail accounts, both have the exact same issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Account #1 was created years ago, has nearly 50,000 emails in the archive folder, and has around 25 messages that are actively flagged/starred...\n\n*Account #2 was created this morning, has 6 total emails with 1 flagged/starred.\n\n\nAfter setting up Apple Mail for the first time on BOTH of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flagged emails DO show in the inbox.\n\n*The 'Flagged' mailbox is empty.\n\n*Searching for 'Flagged' messages returns no results.\n\n*A smart mailbox for flagged emails shows as empty.\n\n*The 'Starred' folders on both accounts are gone.  Sometimes they will\nappear after a re-lauch of apple mail, but they disappear a few\nseconds after that.\n\n\nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried rebuilding the inbox multiple times, with no effect.\n\n*Based on another suggestion, I deleted \"Envelope Index\" files and waited for them to rebuild.  Once complete I tried doing a search for flagged messages and waited...  With no effect...\n\n\nIn short: I can't view any flagged messages by any means because the Starred folders are gone (but present on both my iPad and my iPhone), and because flagged message simply will not show up as they normally do...\n\nA: Maybe it's too late for this reply but I found a solution: Just create an empty mailbox in your mac, then drag and drop the emails that should be flagged to that folder. They'll appear again correctly in the Flagged folder.\nI came up with this solution because I found out that new mail that I received and then flagged did appear correctly.\n\nA: You write that you rebuilt the mail index, but I assume your Spotlight index is broken. You should also try to re-index your disk via the Graphical User Interface (Spotlight pref pane) or in Terminal. Good luck!\n", "Q: Is it possible to reassign the \"Pinch with thumb and three fingers\" gesture to activate Dashboard instead of Launchpad? I don't really have a use for Launchpad, but the gesture to me makes sense for Dashboard. I experimented a little with BetterTouchTool, but it doesn't have the gesture available, and I'm not sure it would work well with the sequence of successive pinches and spreads to go from desktop Expose to overlay (normally Launchpad).\nIdeally I'd like to see if there's a plist tweak that can be made somewhere that would keep the gesture behavior exactly the same, but substitute Dashboard for Launchpad.\n\nA: I'm not sure if there's a plist modification you can do to alter the behaviour, but I do know that BetterTouchTool will let you replace the pinch zoom in/out gestures with custom actions. You can assign them to activate Dashboard instead of LaunchPad if you like or any number of other things. It can be a bit involved to set up, but it is very powerful in what it lets you override from the OS X defaults.\nTUAW has an article on customizing a Magic TrackPad using Better Touch Tool that demystifies it a bit.\n\nA: You could take a look at MagicPrefs application.  It has all kinds of custom gestures.  Also the built in command in Apple OS for Dashboard is swiping from the left with 4 fingers on the trackpad.  With MagicPrefs you can change it to anything and also make custom actions.  I have used it from 10.8 and up.\nhttp://magicprefs.com/\n\nA: I tried BetterTouchTool (BBT), Jitouch, and MagicPrefs.  I've been using BBT for more than three years, making me unable to use any mouse other than Magic Mouse (you can't get a mouse with dozens of keys on it...)\nFor overall performance, BBT is the best and is totally free, it has plenty of gesture and plenty of preference with a perfect UI structure.\nMagicPrefs (free) is worst among the 3 because it has very limited gestures and preferences in a neat UI that looks pretty but actually not good enough. \n\nJitouch is not free, BUT! it has two more gesture than BBT:\n3 finger PINCH on trackpad ( this is what NReilingh may want ) \nand \"directional\" 2 finger pinch on magic mouse\n", "Q: How can I force Apple Mail to COMPLETELY refresh an IMAP account? I have a Gmail account that is configured on three different Macs, let's call them Home, Work, and MacBook. Home and MacBook are on iCloud, Work is not, and MacBook is the one experiencing the issue.\nNo matter what I seem to do, Apple Mail on the MacBook, for only this Gmail account, displays no messages in any folder, and indicates two unread messages in the inbox. Home and Work display the same account correctly, with an accurate reflection of the inbox and messages contained in other folders.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Synchronize\n\n*Rebuild\n\n*Disable account, quit, remove ~/Library/Mail/V2/IMAP-address@imap.gmail.com folder, then restart\n\n*Removed the keychain items for the account from iCloud, remove folder above\n\n\nEach time, the account comes back with two unread messages out of zero. The Account Info screen shows accurate numbers for everything except the \"Sent Mail\" folder (though nothing in any folder displays). In experimenting with enabling and disabling IMAP for labels within Gmail, I have seen the item for the \"Sent Mail\" folder in Account Info display with the correct number of messages, but a title of \"Sent Mail\" does not exist. Very odd. Sorry I don't have a screenshot of that.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work for everyone, but I was able to resolve the issue in two parts. To get messages to display properly for all folders on the account, I needed disable/remove the account from iCloud so that it was no longer being synced. Then I removed the mailbox folder described in the question, and added it locally to the MacBook.\nAfter the folders were displaying properly, the index was still a little messed up in that the inbox was displaying an unread count that didn't exist.\nTo get rid of this, I had to rebuild the full index -- this appears to be different from the Rebuild function that exists in the Mailbox menu, and is more similar to what happens when you open an upgraded version of mail for the first time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail\n\n*Navigate to ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData\n\n*Delete any file that starts with \"Envelope Index\"\n\n*Start Mail\n\n*Follow prompts to allow Mail to rebuild the index -- this may take a few restarts of the app.\n\n\nA: You are on the right track with cleaning things \"like an animal\" in ~/Library, but there are some downsides to this.\nThe first thing to do is to make sure it's really not a problem with Apple Mail and Gmail server settings. I would make a new user account on the problematic Mac and set up just that mail account. Your theory that the MacBook is the problem is most likely, but what if both other Macs are corrupt and the MacBook is actually getting what Gmail is sending out (albeit Apple Mail is interpreting those bits wrongly).\nIf I were to mess in ~/Library, I'd do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a good backup of my Mac (time machine or other)\n\n*Zip up Mail Downloads - deleting the mailbox data will leave orphan downloads, so I'll need to sort those later.\n\n*Quit mail and disable all mail accounts in the Internet Accounts pane of system preferences (uncheck them)\n\n*Move the following directories and files to trash.\n\n~/Library/Mail\n  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail\n  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.MailServiceAgent\n  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail-shared.plist  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and empty trash / reverify that the above files are really gone.\n\n*Delete and re-add that one gmail account to Internet Accounts from System Preferences\n\nA: I recommend to prevent the gmail to sync everything.\nThat can be achieved by going to the \"labels\" sections of the gmail settings.\nYou can also go to the IMAP/POP section of the settings and limit the number of messages to sync per IMAP folder, I use 1000 messages.\nI know It's not a solution but certainly help me a lot with gmail sync problems with Apple Mail.app.\n\nA: I tried everything you tried, and I also tried bmike's suggestions. Deleting all the preferences/caches etc caused more problems than it solved, so I put them back and decided to try a more surgical approach. For anyone still reading this, the thing that seemed to fix it in the end was \n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the relevant folders in ~/Library/Mail/V2/\n\n*Editing Accounts.plist in a text editor, and removing the section pertaining to the unwanted account.\n\n\nAs everyone else has suggested, make sure you've got backups before you try anything - but it worked fine for me.\n\nA: Based on the information you gave, it sounds like Gmail is set up incorrectly on the Macbook.  I would make sure that the mail settings in Mail>Preferences>Accounts is exactly the same on all three computers.  It really sounds like Gmail on the Macbook is set up as a POP account.\n", "Q: Logged into 4 iPhones and 2 iPads - how can I remove my account or deactivate them all except one? Logged into 4 iPhones and 2 iPads - how can I remove my account or deactivate them all except one? I am not tech savvy at all and didn't realize they would have access to my info. I only want to keep my info on 1 iPhone & 1 iPad, which are the ones I use. Would this be able to be done without physically having access to the other devices? Or do I need to physically have them, if so, what do i do? I logged into my email account too.\n\nA: If you have the devices simply go to Settings>iCloud turn off Find my iPhone, and sign out of iCloud, then tap on Settings>General>Reset>Erase All Content and Settings.\nIf you don't have th devices the only options you have is remote wipe, or change all passwords for your accounts.  Remote wipe is an iCloud feature.  Go to www.icloud.com from a computer and sign-in. Click on 'Find my iPhone' tap on the device name and you will see an option to 'remote wipe'.  This can be done on your iPad with the Find my iPhone app.\nIf your devices are not found in Find my iPhone then change your iCloud/AppleID password(s) at myappleid.com.

In Keynote prior to version 6, it was possible to set a build in the master slide. Keynote 6 has removed that option. I find I'm manually going through every slide to add this animation.\nIs there some way to do this in a more automated / efficient way?\n\nA: Under the \"format\" menu, you should be able to copy the animation you want and paste it for any other object. Does that not work?\n\nA: In previous version of Keynote you could add animations to a section of the master, and those would apply to all slides with that master. It appears that Apple in its wisdom has disabled this feature. So the previous answer is correct: the only way to \"automate\" is to paste the animation into each slide. \n", "Q: Running second Google Drive Crashes constantly on OSX Mavericks I have been trying to get a second instance of Google Drive to run under another user on my MBP running Mavericks. \nI have been following the instructions here http://truongtx.me/2013/06/30/macos-using-multiple-google-drive-accounts-at-the-same-time/ . \nEach time I try to run the new instance using sudo su user -c \"/Applications/Google\\ Drive.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Drive\" I get the following erors:\n/Applications/Google Drive.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload\n2014-05-09 14:30:15.593 Google Drive[97308:c07] GsyncAppDeletegate.py : Finder debug level logs : False\n2014-05-09 14:30:15.876 Google Drive[97308:c07] CoreText performance note: Client called CTFontCreateWithName() using name \".Lucida Grande UI\" and got font with PostScript name \".LucidaGrandeUI\".

While the iMac is asleep, the hard drive spins up and down every minute or so (without fail), creating an annoying rattling sound as it spins up - characteristic of hard drives. This is incredibly annoying, especially at night.\nIt doesn't exhibit this behaviour when it is powered on, just when it is asleep. I've tried disabling Power Nap, and checking and unchecking \"Automatically put hard disks to sleep when possible\", all to no avail. \nIt sounds more like a software issue than a hardware issue, has anyone else experienced similar behaviour with the Fusion Drive?\nIs there anything I can do to stop this? It's driving me crazy.\n\nA: There are 2 ways to look what is it doing in sleep.\nOne is open the Console in utility, then look at the sleep hours log messages.\nIf you need help with that publish a copy of that segment here in your question.\nThe second way is using the Terminal in the utility.\nIn Terminal window type pmset -g\nThat will show you a list of sleep mode settings and who is preventing the sleep.\n\nA: I had this exact problem and it was driving me nuts! The iMac was going to sleep, I could hear the HDD stopping, then a few seconds later it would spin up for about 20 seconds, stop, wake up again a few seconds later... and so on.\nTried checking print queues, even removed old printing software as a precaution, turned off power/wake settings, checked diagnostics, logged in as a different user, tried safe mode... no good.\nThen I thought about what most recently happened around the same time. Other that upgrading to El Capitan, my wife needed a new laser mouse urgently. I bought a plain black cheap-and-nasty $5 J.BURROWS brand \"Made in China\" model from Officeworks to get by. Great mouse and great value, but there is something quirky about it that keeps triggering the HDD to wake up.\nCheap mouse gone, no more spin-up issues!!!\nSo, if you're experiencing this problem, before you dive into technical software tweaks, go back to basics and try changing keyboard, mouse or any new peripheral you've recently added.\n", "Q: Using visudo to edit sudoers on Mac I have somehow managed to make the sudoers file on my Mac error:\n    $ sudo visudo\n    >>> /etc/sudoers: syntax error near line 45 <<<\n    sudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers near line 45\n    sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\n\nSo, I went and got the standard sudoers file from here, logged in as root and copied it from Documents to /etc, but that didn't solve the problem.\nIf I try to run visudo using root it fires up Sublime Text and I see a blank sudoers.tmp which I understand is the lock file.\nIf I try and copy the contents of the downloaded sudoers file into sudoers.tmp using Sublime I get the above error.\nSo, does anyone have a solution to this?\nWhat should I see when I run the 'visudo' command, Sublime Text and sudoers.tmp?\n\nA: If your visudo does not work as expected, maybe because your editor does not work correctly, try setting the the EDITOR environment variable to a sane value, then launching visudo:\nEDITOR=nano visudo\n\nThis will work for sh, bash, dash, and other compatible shells.\n\nA: I ran into this issue today, and was helped along by the information above, but I wanted to keep my editor set to Sublime for other purposes.  I added the following to my ~/.bash_profile, which solves the visudo issue, but doesn't change my default editor for git, etc.\nalias visudo='EDITOR=vi sudo visudo'\n\nWhen executed, this changes the editor to vi for the command that follows, and lets you edit the sudoers file successfully.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 boot loop, no DFU possible please excuse, I am new to iPhone, as I repair it for a friend.\nIt's an 4S from USA that some other friend of him wanted to unlock for germany.  \nSo I don't know what he did exactly, but:\nWhen I restart by holding home+power, it restarts like expected.

Automator would seem to the appropriative tool, but ehmac.ca is stumped and so has this board been so far — my \"Automator Newbie\" question asked yesterday (my first ever on this site).

But since they did not put any instructions in how this could be done. I will add it here as an alternative option.\nThe input of the service stays the same. And the first action as discussed in the comments should be Get Folder Contents.\nAll other actions can be removed and two actions of Change image type  should be added.\nThe first Change image type  is set to jpeg.\nThe second is set to tiff.\nThats it simple.\n\nOpen bigger image\n\n", "Q: Mapping does not work with some characters in KeyRemap4Macbook I want to map Option+Dot and Option+Comma to word-by-word movement in KeyRemap4Macbook.

They are connected through the headphone jack, to be played through the AUX setting on the speakers. \n\nA: First, plug the speakers into something else to make sure they work as-is.\nNext, check the headphone jack to see if there is a red light emanating from it. I have never personally experienced it, but I have seen reports of MacBooks being tricked into \"thinking\" that it should be in optical output mode and getting stuck that way. If so, sometimes removing and replacing the speaker cable a few times may help.

Since we added a value to the boot-args variable in NVRAM, resetting it will clear it out.\nIf/Once you get back into OS X, try the following per Apple:\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64\n\nRather than write into the NVRAM (which was likely modified by rEFIt), this writes a value to com.apple.Boot.plist and persists on the volume.\n", "Q: Is Maverick faster than Lion on a MacbookPro year 2009? I want to format and reboot my old 15\" MacBook Pro year 2009 (2.4 GHz, Intel Core 2 Duo,  RAM 8 GB). I'll use it with Office, Chrome and VLC, nothing else. Given that, what's the best choice between Mountain Lion and Maverick? \n\nA: That depends.\nFirst of all assuming that your hardware is per requirement for either OS.\nThe 3 apps you mentioned, you will not notice speed improvement in VLC or Office 2011 since those apps are not really speed dependent, but since Mavericks has better overall process task management it could be faster.\nIf you were to use Safari instead of Chrome you would notice improved speed in Safari with Mavericks.\nThe Mavericks does have a better memory (RAM) management them ML that can be helpful even for Office and VLC to make them work faster.\nIf you care about batter utilization then mavericks wins that one.\nIn summary, generally new software are always better (faster) the older one, otherwise they would defeat the purpose of been released as a improvement.\n", "Q: Moving iBooks library to an external drive Is there any way to move the existing iBooks library on my MacBook (Mavericks) to an external drive and also ensure iBooks treats that as the new location for all future purposes? I am running out of space on my default drive and need to unclutter it.\n\nA: You can copy, then symlink, the iBooks folder to an external drive.\nThe iBooks library is stored in the following location:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books\n\nQuit iBooks, then move this1 folder to an external drive.

I'm aware of the Add to Reading List command available in the context menu; I just find it more cumbersome than I'd like, especially for newsletters such as StackExchange's, which are essentially a collection of links.\n\nA: You can use Keyboard Maestro with a macro such as this. The following macro will add the link to the Reading List if the link is clicked whilst holding control and alt.

Since supporting 64 bits on 32-bit hosts incurs additional overhead, VirtualBox only enables this support upon explicit request.\n\nVMWare Fusion says something similar (search the FAQ for \"64-bit\").\nAssuming your Mac Pro is the 2.66 Quad Core, EveryMac confirms that your processor is 64-bit.

I would like to be able to create a disk image (that I can transfer via Disk Utility.app to a large USB storage thumb drive) which is a multiboot installer for provisioning various operating systems from a single USB drive.  I need to be able to create the image in one step to include multiple bootable OS installers (various multiple versions of OS X/Windows/Linux/Linux based Recovery Platforms), all from a single OS X machine.\nI found a nice tutorial for creating a multiboot usb thumbdrive via Linux that will boot OS X on a Mac, and Linux or Windows on PCs or Macs, and obviously, if I already have a Linux virtual machine, I could use YUMI as indicated in the tutorial (and I have seen other, similar tutorials that use a similar utilities to do this from Windows like SARDU and XBOOT), but I am hoping to discover a similar OS X native method or application that accomplishes the same thing.\nI am aware of and own the commercial application iPartition, and obiously have access to  fdisk and gpt amongst other command line utilities available for use which likely could do the job. If I knew exactly how to set up and where to place the specific individual platform partitions, then I might be able to use one of them. I'd be relatively satisfied with an answer with suggested examples of how to set up this complex partition table, with any explanation on what is particular or different about the types of partitions needed and where they go, and maybe some example syntax for the command line utilities as well.\n\nAdding this not to answer my own question, but to help whomever answers, and I hope with even easier instructions. Maybe it can be done another way? Maybe following a guide to create a multiboot Mac would work, except instead of using the internal harddrive, install on a USB drive as though it were the internal drive, and solve the desire to be able to do this without actually having access to Linux and Windows machines. See here, here, and here. I really want instructions my mother could follow.\n\nA: The way to do this is to create multiple partitions on the USB drive.\nThere is a Tech Republic article that gives the full details on how to do this:\nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-create-an-os-x-multiboot-usb-install-drive/\nIn summary, TechRepublic gives the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Disk Utility, create separate partitions for each version of MacOS that will be booted. (Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format; In \"Options\" choose \"GUID Partition Table.\")  It's a good idea to name the partitions for the Mac OS version you'll be booting.\n\n*Copy the relevant contents to the particular partitions.  This is different for different versions of MacOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple OS X 10.7 (Lion), 10.8 (Mountain Lion):\na. Right-click the installer and select Show Package Contents from the context menu;\nb. Drill-down through the Contents | Shared Support directories and drag-drop the InstallESD.dmg to the desktop;\nc. Using Disk Utility's \"Restore\" tab, Perform a Restore into the appropriate partition, using InstallESD.dmg as the source.  This takes about 30 minutes.\n\n*Apple OS X 10.4 (Tiger), 10.5 (Leopard), 10.6 (Snow Leopard):\nSince these were distributed as DVDs, you restore from the DVD or ISO image. (DVD restore will be much slower than the file restore method.) Use Disk Utility's \"Restore\" tab with the DVD or ISO image as the source.\n\n*Apple OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and 10.10 (Yosemite):\nIse the new \"createinstallmedia\" command. If your installer.app is not in /Applications, modify the \"-applicationpath\" argument appropriately.)\nFor example:  \n\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia —volume /Volumes/DRIVE_LABEL —applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app —nointeraction\n\n\nI expect that the method for 10.7 and 10.8 will work for later versions of MacOS as well.\n\nA: While Googling for the same desire (instead, I have Linux/Win as dual boot available hosts) considering to abuse Yumi for it.\nI found Easy2Boot, which looks promising.\nHere's a forum topic about the Easy2Boot tool including YouTube video:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/162640-install-all-windows-install-isos-from-1-multiboot-usb-drive/\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBKh_jDyTmQ\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyQ7xSvVMHE\nI'm about to try it out.\nYou could use the opensouce Virtualbox to get Windows running inside OS X\n", "Q: How can I save all modified files in Preview in one go? When I open several images in preview and apply quick modifications in succession I would like to close preview and save all the files without questions. Unfortunately preview keeps asking for each modified file if I want to save it or restore the original. Which is  anyway quite useless because it only offers the name instead of showing what image is the question about.\nThe only quick and manual way I've found is to use the keyboard shortcuts for save + close window in quick succession.

The clicking noise is probably your internal harddrive beginning to fail. You should back up your data immediately and prepare to replace your hard drive, as clicking is often a good indicator that the drive is about to stop working. You can check the drive's SMART status using Disk Utility.app, but it may not report anything amiss until its too late.\nYou can find detailed instructions on checking the drive's SMART status here, but the meat of it is accomplished just by stealing their image, which I'll link to below.\n\n\nA: 1) The region you are referring to is exactly where the fan is located. This may be what is causing the noise, although it could potentially be the optical drive as well. You can find an extensive DIY guide, along with the needed components, at iFixit.

Additionally, Apple may refuse to service it in the event that you fail to fix the problem. \n3) Yes. \n4) If you are okay with (2), and are able to carefully follow the guide linked to in (1), then yes. It's very possible that either the fan is damaged or there is some small component stuck in its vicinity, rattling around. It's also possible the optical drive is damaged and would require replacement. I wouldn't advise this if you were in any warranty window, but you aren't.

Until now, I was under the impression that ePub was the de facto standard for Apple and the default format used by iBooks. But recently I downloaded some ebooks from the iTunes store and found them to have the .ibooks extension instead. What's the difference between the two? Also, how can one convert an ePub document into an ibooks document, if that is possible?\n\nA: An .iBooks-file is an .EPUB-file with extra properties and features added by Apple once it has been made available via Apple's iBooks. (At this point it can be downloaded from the iBooks application)\nSo basically it is just an extended with some Apple properties epub-file. Like Author publisher details which is visible in iBooks.app as well.\nsource 1 - PC.net\nsource 2 - Zdnet.com\n\nA: EPUB is indeed a common standard, and also the default standard in use by Apple for both .pub and .ibooks files.\nThe difference between the two is the addition to .ibooks files (as others have stated) of undocumented, proprietary XML namespaces and undocumented extensions to CSS, which include options for fonts, mathematical equation rendering, and more interactivity options.  This allows the facility within some author tools like iBooks Author to include what are essentially dashboard widgets to be embedded into documents which are not supported in standard EPUB.\nBoth file types are essentially using either the EPUB 2 or 3 standard internally, but both are typically only viewable using the iBooks applications on iOS and OSX for a couple of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, .ibooks have the aforementioned extensions which are not openly documented and therefore only Apple know what to do with them\n\n*Secondly they are commonly copy protected with DRM.  The FairPlay DRM system used by Apple is again, only intended for use on official iOS and OSX appplications.\nThe EPUB specification does not enforce or suggest a particular DRM scheme, but the standard allows for an additional layer that is not required for publishers to implement. This affects the level of support for various DRM systems on devices and the portability of purchased e-books. Consequently, such DRM incompatibility segments the EPUB format along the lines of DRM systems, undermining the advantages of a single standard format and confusing the consumer.\nConfusingly, because the DRM is essentially allowed but not dictated or enforced not all EPUB files are readable on all readers that support EPUB, as they also require compatibility with the DRM system if one is used.  As such, a DRM'd EPUB from Apple, is only readable on Apple software, but Apple aren't the only people to do this.  Adobe Digital Editions are EPUB files using the .epub filename extension that are not readable using the iBooks applications, as they require online activation to provide authentication in exactly the same way.\nIt's worth noting that not all EPUB files have such DRM, but many, particularly ones bought online, especially from Apple, do.\nFinally, as to how you can convert an .epub to a .ibooks, you would imagine the simplest way is to use the free iBooks Author application from the Mac Apple Store, and simply load it in, and save it out - however despite that iBooks is happily using EPUB under the covers, there is no import option and the tool is intended to be used to create new content from scratch, rather than convert existing stuff.  You can copy/paste to achieve the net result but there is no practical reason to do this, as using the .ibooks format in and of itself confers no extra benefits or functionality than reading it in the original .epub format, in fact it further limits the potential portability of the document which is a net loss in usability.\n\nA: .ibooks files are a special Apple-only multi-touch version of the epub standard.  They can only be created using the iBooks Author app, and they can only be read by the iBooks app on an iOS device or a Mac running OS 10.9 or higher. \nThe main attraction of the .ibooks format for authors is that it can easily incorporate a large variety of interactive features via widgets.  The Apple list is at http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2789 and a 3rd party list is at https://bookry.com/author/widget/library/\n.epub is an open standard which can be produced by a number of apps (including Apple's Pages) and can be read on any platform using a variety of apps (including Apple's iBooks).  There is no way to convert .epub to .ibooks, other than to put the content into iBooks Author and republish it from that app.\nStarting with version 2.3 of June 2015, iBooks Author can also produce .epub format, as long as one of the .epub templates is used.\n", "Q: Remote desktop apps for OS X Mavericks 10.9 I have tried CoRD, Microsoft Remote Desktop and RDC but all three are not compatible with Mavericks 10.9\nCan someone recommend how I can connect to my Windows 7 computer from my mac?\n\nA: In the past, I've used LogMeIn to remotely connect to a Windows 7 system from my Mac.

It should have some wireless signal you can see even if you can't join the network unless the hardware is totally faulty.\nWithout a viable ethernet or WiFi connection, your chances of re-loading the firmware are low and you might have to open it and see if a hardware repair is in order.

Again, there is an Amazon Cloud Player app for iOS as well.\nOn your Mac, Amazon Instant Video is available through the Amazon website itself.  If you have video in your library, you can access it through Your Video Library.  In general, though, any video you have rights to view (e.g. with Prime Instant Video), you can access by finding it on Amazon's website.

How do I delete the items that appear or, even better, only a selection of them?\n\nA: I presume you are referring to Safari.

Paste this into a web browser, download the .ics file, double-click and finally we are there: All holidays for the next 10 years are imported, and all of the unwanted events can be deleted manually.\n\nA: No — subscribing to a calendar will add all the events to your calendar and it is not possible to hide any of them, just all of them by hiding the entire calendar.\n\nA: I basically made copies of the holidays I wanted to show and unsubscribed from the calendar. IE, I duplicated the holidays for this province only and unsubscribed from the Canadian holidays so I wouldn't get holidays from every other province cluttering up my calendar. You can specify how you want the holiday to repeat by selecting yearly, say for Christmas, or custom, such as the third Monday every May for Victoria Day, by editing the settings for each holiday.

I have an external hard-disk with a single Mac OS Extended partition. This disk stopped working couple of days ago. I tried to repair the partition with disk utility but no luck. The error message is the following: \n\nError: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nAny ideas or tools I can try to repair my disk? \n\nA: I had luck with fsck on the command line using slightly different options from above.\nUsed df -hl to determine the path of the disk device as above (in my case my first external USB drive, /dev/disk1s1)\nThen use\nsudo fsck_hfs -r -d /dev/disk1s1\n\nThe -r option rebuilds the Catalog B-Tree. Not sure why disk utility doesn't do this automatically. The -d option shows extra debugging information. See Repair disk from single user mode (fsck fails) and the fsck_hfs man page for details.\nBefore you rebuild the Catalog B-Tree, be sure to run a standard fsck first, as rebuilding the Catalog B-Tree on a corrupted filesystem can lead to further data loss or filesystem corruption.\nYou can also use sudo fsck_hfs -Race -d /dev/diskid instead of sudo fsck_hfs -r -d /dev/diskid to rebuild the attribute and overflow tree as well.\n\nA: You may not need to repair the disk!\nIs this an external drive you're sharing between a Mac and a Windows PC?  I've had this issue a few times with a disk formatted FAT32.  If you don't unmount your disk properly when you remove it from your Windows PC, the whole volume will be marked as \"busy\" and you'll be prompted to repair the volume if you look at it in Apple's Disk Utility.  However Disk Utility will fail to repair the volume, and report:\nCan't open (Resource busy)\nFile system check exit code is 8.\nThe fix is easy, just plug that drive back in to a Windows PC, and unmount it properly before plugging it into your Mac.  \nIt's not uncommon for a USB drive to be disconnected by just yanking out the cable, and usually that doesn't cause any trouble, and integrity is verified when you plug it back in.  Ideally Macs would recognize this common issue and work around it, but it appears they only trust Microsoft to validate that the filesystem is OK.\n\nA: One thing to try that is perhaps extreme is to place the drive in a few layers of freezer bags and cool it in the freezer, and then try to get it to mount, and copy off what data you can until it fails again, and then repeat this process. Its absurd, but it has worked for me and there is a lot of anacdotal evidence that this can help recover data, regardless of the myth-dispelling posts that started to appear on the internet once the idea was picked up by major tech news outlets.\n\nA: I had this issue with an external disk in ExFAT, nothing worked. I was just about to use recovery software but boot into Windows, Windows read it fine. Booted back into OS X and now everything is as it should be. Weird.\n\nA: There is a chance to repair it with command line (in Terminal) with the terminal utility as described in Apple's support docs, shown below:\n\nUse the command line and the fsck_hfs -l command.\nStart up your computer and log in as an administrator.\nOpen Terminal (/Applications/Utilities).\nAt the prompt, type the following command and then press Return to determine your filesytem ID:\ndf -hl\n\nLook for some lines of text that look like this:\nFilesystem Size Used Avail Capacity Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s3 37G 20G 17G 55% /\n/dev/disk0s5 37G 37G 641M 98% /Volumes/Storage\n\nMake a note of the External Disk \"disk\" name that appears after /dev/, such as \"/dev/disk0s3.\" This is your filesystem ID for your External volume.\nAt the prompt, type the following command and then press Return:\ndf -hl\n\nThen type the following command, where \"disk1\" is your filesystem ID you noted in step 4, then press Return:\nsudo fsck_hfs -l /dev/disk1\n\nWhen prompted, enter your admin password, then press Return to begin the verification.\nYou should see messages like these during the disk check:\n** /dev/rdisk0s3 (NO WRITE)\n** Root file system\n** Checking HFS Plus volume.\n** Checking Extents Overflow file.\n** Checking Catalog file.\n** Checking multi-linked files.\n** Checking Catalog hierarchy.\n** Checking Extended Attributes file.\n** Checking volume bitmap.\n** Checking volume information.\n** The volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK.\n\n\n\nA: When you plugin a damaged Apple_HFS disk into Mavericks/Yosemite it runs fsck_hfs on its own.\nYou can see the output (in Terminal):\ntail -f /var/log/fsck_hfs.log\n\nWait for it to finish before running repair yourself.\nAlso repair needs to be run repeatedly to repair some errors. I recently needed to launch it 7 times but it repaired the disk successfully in the end. You can use either fsck_hfs or Disk Utility.\n\nA: Honestly, Apple is rather conservative when it comes to reporting errors. Sometimes (some people would say) to a fault. So when they do indicate an issue like this. It MIGHT be fixable with a third party program but honestly the first thing you should do is Backup Your Data. As it is likely that even if the drive is not toast there is a distinct likelihood of data loss.\nOn rare occasions booting from external media or the recovery partition (COMMAND-R) and running Disk Utility from that, could repair it. Worth a try as it only costs you a little time.\nPersonally I use DiskWarrior and have recovered drives that Disk Utility can't touch, including that exact error message. No guarantee it will do the trick but it's cheaper than a new HD. \nIf you own no other commercial software, that is the one you want. And keep it updated and on bootable media that works on all your currently owned Macs. I do.\n\nA: I've had good experience fixing volumes (even when disk utility says it can't fix it) using Diskwarrior for HFS/HFS+ and/or TechTool Pro for HFS/HFS+/APFS.\nBoth of them are paid, there might be freeware alternatives but I don't have personal experience with any.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my external Toshiba HD- my macbook wouldn't recognize the HD until after unplugging it and then prompted for a password (which hasn't been applicable for months). I tried all possibilities of a previous password, received the same error message in disk utility when trying to repair the HD, and finally was able to correct this error by utilizing the free OS upgrade to Yosemite. Hope it helps!! \n\nA: You first need to determine whether the problem is with the disk hardware or the filesystem. To learn whether the hardware is failing, you can use a utility that will evaluate the SMART data. Apple's Disk Utility does a limited form of this, but it's not nearly as reliable as a dedicated tool. I use SMART Utility -- the free trial will provide all the info you need for a one-time diagnosis. \nIf the hardware is bad, you should not try to repair the filesystem. You are in a data recovery situation.\nIf the drive is OK according to SMART Utility, you should try repairing the filesystem with Alsoft DiskWarrior. DiskWarrior is developed by a team with intimate knowledge of the HFS filesystem, and it's able to fix problems that Disk Utility cannot.\n\nA: For me, Disk Utility on Snow Leopard works at repairing permissions for drives but not on Mavericks. Strange.\n\nA: If Disk Utility can't repair the volume, it means that its directory structure is damaged to point where it can't find all catalogued files any more.\nWhile you can now try copying all files to another disk, this may result in lots of errors, and you may also not get all files that are still theoretically recoverable.\nTherefore, I recommend that you use the product Data Rescue for this recovery job. It scans the entire disk (takes a while), searching for \"lost fragments\" of the catalog, trying its best to recover as much as possible.\nWith a disk that's marked unrepairable, you should not try to keep writing to it (in fact, it should be made read-only, which is, sadly not as simple any more as it used to be long ago), because any further writes may overwrite valid data, due to the damaged catalog.\nSo, get a large enough second disk and start rescuing. Do not attempt to fix this volume unless you do not care for more losses.\n\nA: Short Story: Use DiskWarrior\nMy computer crashed and damaged directory files on my external hard drive. So it wouldn't mount but I could see it in Disk Utility (altho it wouldn't repair). Paid the $120 for the diskwarrior, went thru everything and it was fine. Gives you a preview to grab files too before they go in and fix the bug. Worth the money.\n\nA: Read somewhere about trying to click Repair several times until it worked. It took a while until it took it and I was able to recover the disk , backed it up and format it.\n\nA: Problem with Catalina and NTFS\nIf you are experiencing this issue with your NTFS disk after upgrading your OS to Catalina, install the Paragon Driver https://www.seagate.com/support/software/paragon/.\nI found the answer from a Reddit thread.\n", "Q: Passing a password to an Automator application I have written an Automator application with the following shell script to open an FTP connection on my system:\nsudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to display alert \"SFTP Opened\"'\n\nThis works exactly as expected except that the sudo command needs a password. When the same command is run on Terminal, it prompts me for a password but when run as an Automator app, doesn't prompt me for any input. Is there anyway to programmatically pass the password to this sudo within the Automator script?

And please don’t suggest using Automator’s System variable “IP address” with a separate “Ask for Confirmation” box because I want the IP to be displayed as a part of my existing message in the alert that I am already showing.\n\nA: You can set a variable containing your IPv4, then append the contents of the variable to the contents of the alert message:\nset ipaddress to IPv4 address of (get system info)\ntell app \"Finder\" to display alert \"SFTP opened and your IP address is \" & ipaddress\n\n", "Q: Check FTP status using AppleScript I have an AppleScript Automator application that, when double-clicked, opens FTP and displays an alert confirming the same. It is working perfectly as expected. However, I am looking to make it a tad more intuitive so that it opens FTP ONLY if FTP isn't already open. If FTP is already open on my system, the app should close it.\nSo, basically I want to use the app as a toggle switch which opens or closes FTP depending on its prevailing status. The code I am currently using to open FTP and display the alert is as follows:\nset ipaddr to IPv4 address of (get system info)\nset sun to short user name of (get system info)\ndo shell script \"sudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\" with administrator privileges\ntell application \"Finder\" to display alert \"FTP Launched and ready for file-transfer\" & character id 8233 & character id 8233 & \"User Name: \" & sun & character id 8233 & \"IP address: \" & ipaddr\n\nCan anyone please point me in the right direction? Is there any system variable that can be used to retrieve the FTP status? On Terminal, I could use this:\nftp localhost\n\nAnd the results would tell me if it's open or closed. But how can I let AppleScript know the same?\nAdditional info: Output of \"ftp localhost\" on Terminal\nHere's the result of ftp localhost when FTP is closed:\n\nAnd here's the result when FTP is open:\n\nHere, I just hit return without any input and then it gives this:\n\n\nA: This works as a shell test, if you replace  with your target.\necho \"QUIT\" | telnet <host> ftp 2>&1 | grep  \"Escape character is\" > /dev/null\n\nWe're using hardly any complex tools, we just send a command to the server that makes it close our connection. If this works, the ftp-server is up and running. If we couldn't connect at all, this line returns 1, else it returns 0.\nDigested to an AppleScript it's something like\nset hostn to <host>\ntry\n    do shell script \"echo \\\"QUIT\\\" | telnet \" & hostn & \" ftp 2>&1 | grep  \\\"Escape character is\\\" > /dev/null\"\n    display dialog \"Online.\"\non error\n    display dialog \"Not online.\"\nend try\n\n", "Q: How to install 'MySQL Utilities' using brew or brew cask?

Have any new techniques surfaced since 2011?\nI would rather have a technique without another app, but if thats the only option then that'll have to do...\n\nA: Yes there is a way :\nSimply go go the App, right click and show package contents.\nGo into Application/Contents and open the info.plist with a simple text editor.\nAdd these Lines under the dict key :\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<true/>\n\nYes, there is a difference. NSUIElement is an old key. Since Apple introduced Launchd services, they use the LSUIElement key. This is also working for Adium, I just tested it.\nIf It says it can't save the file, simply copy it out of the folder to you desktop, edit it, and move it back into the App.\nKeep in Mind, that with the LSUI element, the App is working in the Background. It keeps the menu icon, but your app won't appear in the App-Switcher (CMD+Tab) nor in the Force-Quit Menu.\nHere is a Screenshot on how I did it :\n\n\nA: I've found a way that works for me.\nOriginally, the user chillin told me I could just add this to the Info.plist file in between the dict tags using TextEdit:\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<true/>\n\nBut all I saw was some gibberish (look below for screenshots).\nBut then I installed XCode and opened the Info.plist file in Property List Editor. \nTo open Info.plist, go to your HD (eg.

Here's what you have to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are logged in as an Administrator.\n\n*In Finder, under Applications, find the relevant app. Right-click > select \"Show Package Contents\" > select \"Contents.\" You should now see the directory containing your app, which should include a file called info.plist.\n\n*Double-click the .plist file. This should open the file in TextEdit.\n\n*As soon as you try to do anything to the file, you will get a message saying \"You don’t have permission to write to the folder that the file 'Info' is in\" and offering to let you edit a duplicate. Click \"Duplicate.\"\n\n*Make the edit as above.\n\n*Save the (duplicate) file to your desktop. Name it info.plist. (Be careful not to let Finder change the extension to .txt, or add \"copy\" to the name. If in doubt, uncheck \"Hide extension\" in the lower left of the Save window.)\n\n*Copy this newly-edited file back to the \"Contents\" folder you found in Step 2.\n\n\nN.B.

Or am I doomed to be kept using the printer and the pen?\n\nA: I have tried a few apps myself. I really liked UPad. They have a free version of the app which has nearly all the features. What I like about it is the zoom function. You have a nice palm rest where you can write in a zoomed in portion of the page. It makes writing even with a cheap stylus easy. You can also zoom on the whole page, which is nice for drawing. \nThe app also allows you to import PDF and write on them. I have been using it to annotate all of my classes slides this semester. \nIn brief, the palm rest with the zoomed in window makes it easy to write normally. Try the free version, you'll see. \n\nA: Yes, I believe so!\nThe solution that works best for me is to place something under your hand so you can anchor it against the iPad's display without that interacting with the touch screen while writing. \nTo accomplish this, I'd use a large Zeiss Microfiber cleaning cloth folded a couple times to layer it so that it insulates the hand from the touch screen. You can find these at any WalMart Vision Center inside Walmart for a few bucks. However, any soft layered cloth should do the trick without damaging your display.\n", "Q: Where do applications store local settings? Where does OS X store local settings for applications such as license keys, Skype favorite contacts, etc.  \nYesterday I was troubleshooting an issue with an Apple rep and he had me delete a bunch of files and folders, one of which includes ~/library/caches/*  I can't remember the rest though.  Later I noticed NONE of my programs would launch because they required license keys to be input.  All of my EyeTV scheduled recordings were gone. Dock preferences were reset. It's been a nightmare.\nIf I can get the location of these files, I can just recover them from Time Machine.\n\nA: Applications store their data in any or all of the following locations:\n ~/<individual application folders>\n ~/Documents/<individual application folders>\n ~/Library/<individual application folders>\n ~/Library/Caches/*/<individual application folders>\n ~/Library/Preferences/*/<individual application folders>\n ~/Library/Application\\ Support/<individual application folders>\n /Library/<individual application folders>\n /Library/Caches/*/<individual application folders>\n /Library/Preferences/*/<individual application folders>\n /Library/Application\\ Support/<individual application folders>\n /private/tmp/<esoterically named folders>\n /private/var/tmp/*/<esoterically named folders>\n /private/var/db/receipts/\n\nAlso, it is not unheard of for an application to store data within its own application folder structure.\n\nPlease note that Time Machine does not backup everything. It will automatically exclude such things as iOS device backups among other items such as caches, logs, and what's in the Trash. You can view what is excluded by Time Machine automatically with this command:\n cat /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist\n\n", "Q: Merge old exchange contacts to iCloud (with iPhone) I'm trying to export my contact from my old exchange account to my iCloud account. The problem is that I do not have access to my exchange account anymore. All I have, is my contacts saved on my iphone. I tried syncing my iCloud contacts and merge everything, but I get a message saying that exchange contacts can't be merge. Since I don't have access to my exchange account anymore I also can't export them from outlook to a csv file. \nSo basically, is there an app or a trick to get old exchange contacts saved in the iPhone to iCloud?\nThanks!\n\nA: I would try using iExplorer to extract the contacts from the iPhone.  It works on Mac or PC, and it has a free trial version that should allow you to do everything you need.\n\nA: You can get different apps to do this. I have used 'Contact Mover' and it worked fine. You can sync your exchange contacts to your phone which copies them over.  You can also then get an app to merge the duplicates.\nMy issues is: (Somebody please help me!) I cant seem to find an app to extract all my emails from my iphone that are stored on an exchange I dont have access to anymore. I have been told it can be done but I am yet to find out how.  Anyone know how to extract or copy email data/content from an outlook exchange to icloud?\n\nA: I used Smiling Cloud, it's very good. You sync with the cloud and can recover your contacts anytime. At the same time your contacts may be exported from Exchange to Sim or phone.\n", "Q: iCloud Sync Borked on iPhone My contacts, notes, and calendars on my iPhone all disappeared about a week ago, except for a few which look like contacts I have added directly on the phone. \nIt took me a bit to realize it, but once I did I tried syncing my iPhone to get the contacts, notes, and calendars back. This lead to the realization that my sync settings were messed up because iTunes started trying to backup my entire phone. Somehow the \"Automatically Backup...\" had moved from iCloud to This Computer, so I switched that back to iCloud. I'm the only person who has access to this computer or phone, so these settings changed on their own.\nOnce that sync with my Mac finished and the contacts, notes, and calendars were not restored I went looking and noticed that everything under iCloud syncing had been turned off on my phone, including Find My iPhone which is supposed to only be turned off if I enter my password. Again, I'm the only user and didn't change that so that was weird.\nTurning contacts, notes, and calendars syncing back on under Settings > iCloud has not restored any contacts, notes, or calendars to my phone. I waited a couple hours to give it some time since it is set to check every hour. I have also tried turning on push and changing the time to 15 minutes. I even tried \"manual\" but couldn't find a button to push to do it manually. \nI just tried turning off iCloud syncing and using iTunes to sync contacts, notes, and calendars manually. I tried twice, the first time just clicking sync all, and the second I selected \"Replace information on this Phone\". Neither resulted in any contacts, notes, or calendars on my phone. \nSince I still have no contacts, notes, or calendars on my phone despite having iCloud contact syncing turned on both on my Mac and on my iPhone, is there a way to force the phone to do a fresh pull of the contacts, notes, and calendars from iCloud? \n(Alternatively, have I missed something else that might be keeping iCloud from syncing the contacts, notes, and calendars.)\nIf it is helpful: I just noticed that my broswer tabs are syncing in both directions, Mac to iPhone and vice versa. So iCloud sync isn't completely borked. \n\nA: Open Settings on your iPhone and find the iCloud settings page.\nFind Contacts in the list, and switch it on.\nIf your contacts are still in iCloud, they will sync back to your iPhone.\n\nAlso check in System Preferences/iCloud on your Mac, and make sure those settings are correct, with contacts turned on.\n\nCheck your settings in iTunes, paying close attention to anything regarding \"Contacts\" under iTunes info tab\nIn the summary tab, you should have set things to sync to iCloud\nYour info Contact settings should look like this:\n\n\nA: So my phone froze for about a minute this morning so I shut it down and restarted. On restart iCloud was able to sync contacts, notes, and calendars again.\n\nA: Try going to the Apple store.  The recent update jacked up my phone so that I needed to restore it. My iPhone iTunes settings were erroneously turned on to back up to my computer (last back up was a year ago).  I went to Apple and a technician somehow was able to restore my phone from a recent iCloud backup. \n", "Q: iCloud storage recovery not deleting photo albums Can I delete camera  roll and free up iCloud storage without deleting photos in my albums ?\n\nA: No. The camera roll is and is not just another album. Delete that and you delete all your photos, (though I don't believe it can be deleted), but I believe the albums will remain and be empty. Albums don't store extra copies of photos. When you create albums, these aren't filled with distinct copies of photos, but something similar to aliases or links — at least conceptually. Conversly, Deleting photos from albums does not actually delete the photos from your camera role. You have to delete photos by deleting the photos from your camera role. Albums don't really take up any space, or a very tiny amount of space... maybe dozens of kilobytes. Once an album is empty, it can be deleted.\n\nOn your iPhone, under Settings app/iCloud page, turn off photo syncing. Because there is no way to access iCloud other than in the background autosyncing, this should erase your photos from iCloud and leave them on your iPhone. \nIf you don't have your own computer, buy a largeish usb thumb drive and find a friend with a Mac and have her download iExplorer, connect your iPhone to her Mac with a sync cable, and have her transfer your photos to the usb thumb drive for you. Alternatively, if you have an iPhone 5, the Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader (or usb version w/usb thumb)and a decent sized SD Card, 32-128GB, and a thumb-sized usb SD Card Reader for good measure. Use this combination to connect the SD Card to your iPhone and transfer your Photos to your SD Card periodically, to back them up or free up space on your iPhone. SD Cards are more expensive than USB thumb drives, but the advantage is the data is far more \"durable,\" as these cards are water-proof and nearly indestructable, while usb thumb drives are notoriously unreliable afa massive data corruption.\nApple's Camera Connection Kit was not fully compatible with iPhone 4, but I am seeing evidence that the new lightning camera adapters are compatible with iPhone 5.

For example, A6=SUM(A5,1) would return 1, because Numbers thinks A5 and A4 are empty (whereas A3 contains 2).\n\nA: Using way more math than should be needed, there is a formula that works. In the dummy spreadsheet above, you would put this in A3 and then copy it into all subsequent rows in bulk, just as you'd expect:\n1 + ((    SQRT(8*SUM(  OFFSET($A$2,0,0,SUM(ROW(),-2),1)  )+1)    - 1) ÷ 2)\n\n", "Q: NTFS-3G partition name contains increasing number When using NTFS-3G using OSXFuse installed via Homebrew, my Windows drives are mounted but contain a number that is increased every time the volume is mounted:\n\nThese numbers don't seem to be limited.

How may an Apple's USB port be used to control simple electronic devices e.g. LED(s) ?\nI'm happy for any workable answer, but hopefully someone may know of a link to a supplier of a cheap USB interface that can control a LED (light emitting diode) when plugged into an Apple, and some simple script/application is run to change the LED on/off.\n\nA: Arduino ftw\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino\nYou can get simpler than this, and just use the power from the usb port to power a breadboard LED device. You should really have a basic understanding of electronics, be able to read a schematic, etc., before you do this. Its not that you will electrocute yourself, but you may lose the use of the usb port.\n\nA: A cheaper solution would be to buy for example a Texas Instruments EZ430-F2013. It costs 24$ from TI, and might be gotten cheaper other places. I know earlier one they were giving these out for free.\nIt's a small USB-device in a clear case that has a LED on it already.

An example in the UK would be the Virgin hotspots on the London underground network.\nWhat is the technology used to initiate and display this authentication mechanism and is there a way to have the device / desktop remember the password? A workaround is to open a browser which can remember the password but its very irritating that the password is not remembered and there is no option to remember it.\n\nA: As far as I know, it is not called \"Push notifcation\" as indicated in earlier answer.\nThe correct name for this is a \"Captive portal\".\nThe technology is simply that the user's requests are redirected to a specific web page until the user has authenticated (or whatever requirements the specific provider has).\nThe redirection can technically be done via HTTP (i.e. some kind of HTTP proxy), via ICMP redirects or via sending back fake DNS replies.\nApple has added detection of these captive portals to Mac OS X. After connecting to a WiFi system, Mac OS X will try to access an address at Apple - if it succeeds it assumes the user has general access to the internet.\nIf not, it will assume a captive portal is in place, and popup a window for the user to authenticate to the network.\n", "Q: Simulate how a volume is mounted using diskarbitrationd I'm attempting to emulate how a volume is normally mounted for my NTFS volume that I've added to /private/etc/fstab. Normally, when a volume is found, like an external hard drive, it is mounted and then a shortcut to that volume is put on the Desktop and in the Finder left-hand sidebar. However, since to mount a NTFS volume as read-write in fstab, the flag nobrowse must be added, this prevents it from showing up on the desktop and in Finder's sidebar.\nMy research has pointed me to diskarbitrationd as the program that listens for new volumes and mounts them. I'd like to emulate the automatic adding of shortcuts to the desktop and Finder and removal on volume unmounting, and I'd like to make a script that listens for information from diskarbitationd and do the processing for me. \nHow would I hook into diskarbitrationd and listen for new events, then add the shortcuts to the desktop and Finder after the volume is mounted? \nThanks for your help!\n\nA: You hook into diskarbitrationd by using Apple's Disk Arbitration framework. Basically you call DASessionCreate() to create a DASessionRef, and then register one or more notification callbacks.\nYou would need to register for the DARegisterDiskMountApprovalCallback. This gives you a notification whenever diskarbitrationd is going to mount something new. By returning a DADissenterRef from this callback, you can prevent diskarbitrationd from actually mounting the file system.\nThen you can mount the file system yourself and create shortcuts etc. using standard methods, such as the mount() system call.\nHere's a direct link to the page in the programming guide, you'll need to examine:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DriversKernelHardware/Conceptual/DiskArbitrationProgGuide/ArbitrationBasics/ArbitrationBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009310-CH2-SW1\n", "Q: Why does the iPhone have a physical sound-switch? I'm new to the iPhone world, although I've been down iPod lane for a few years. One thing that is well-known (and even parodied) about Apple devices is the slimmed down and minimalist approach.\nSo it strikes me as odd that there's a dedicated switch on the side, just for silent mode.  There's already the control center for many similar 'quick go to' things, which also includes 'do not disturb' (which in turn doesn't seem that different to me). \nSo what's up with the one-function switch on the side?\n\nA: The late Mr. Jobs felt it was essential to be able to mute a cell phone without pulling it out of your pocket, and/or in the dark, with minimal light disturbance, without having to hold it up to see it, without being distracting to the reason you are muting the phone in the first place. IIRC, he actually described something to this effect at the original iPhone unveiling 29 June 2007\n\nA: The control center is an iOS7 feature and did not exist before.

Handbrake can burn in subtitles and create both MKV and MPEG-4 files.\nThe Handbrake wiki contains more information about what is possible with subtitling:\n\nHandBrake can use subtitles tracks as INPUT from the following sources:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*From DVD’s – Either embedded VOBSUB or CC tracks. \n  \n*From Bluray - PGS Subtitles. \n  \n*User supplied SRT files. \n  \n*From Files (such as mkv or mp4)\n  \n*Embedded subtitle tracks. \n  \n  \n  HandBrake has two methods of subtitle OUTPUT: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Hard Burn: This means the subtitles are written on top of the image permanently. They cannot be turned on or off like on the DVD.\n  \n*Soft Subtitles: This means the subtitles will appear as separate selectable tracks in your output file. With the correct playback software, you’ll be able to enable / disable these subtitles as required.\n  \n\n\nA: \nmy smart TV app (samsung UE55F8000) doesn't render non-latin subtitles correctly\n\nI am assuming this is from your experience, and not a \"published feature\" ;-)\nIf you haven't already tried it, Subler is a utility designed specifically for adding subtitles, however it will losslessly convert the mkv wrapper into an mp4. It will not only rewrap, and not transcode, the video to an iOS/iTunes friendly format, it will transcode the audio from ACC to AAC if necessary, and it will optimize the location of the mpeg-4 atom in the resulting file for iTunes friendly use. It uses a friendly drag and drop paradigm. Download Subler, unzip into your Applications folder and launch Subler. Type command-n to begin, and drag your mkv file into the window, as well as your subtitles file, and choose from the simple available options. These will not be hardcoded subtitles, but perhaps having a properly soft-coded subtitled mp4 will allow your non-latin subtitles to appear without hard-coding them. Again, it does not transcode video, only audio.\n", "Q: AirPort Express and Extreme Wi-Fi strength comparison I'm about to buy an AirPort model but I'm not sure if there is any difference in terms of signal strength and range. There have been comparisons between these two models in the past but I don't think there are any up to date comparisons. \nAs I'm not going to use the \"extra\" features, the only thing that matters to me is the range / signal strength of the n signal. (As I don't have any devices supporting the ac signal). Shouldn't there be a significant difference between the two models because of the \"more advanced\" design of the AirPort Extreme? Like the antennas being placed better or something like that? Thanks!\n\nA: Alright, this is an easy catch here.\nIf you compare AirPort Express which has 2 built-in antennas , the AirPort Extreme has 6 built-in antennas. You should be able to do the math here and jump to the conclusion that the Extreme would have a better range and signal because of this fact.\nTo see the source, please click the back url below the Airport Extreme picture here.\nPlease check this comparison model provided by Apple.\nThe difference for you \n\n\n*\n\n*Express max 300Mbps\n\n*Extreme max 1.3Gbps\n\n\nA: According to this article on about.com:\n\nDefinition: 802.11n is an IEEE industry standard for Wi-Fi wireless\n  local network communications, ratified in 2009. 802.11n is designed to\n  replace the older 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g Wi-Fi technologies. Key\n  Wireless Technologies in 802.11n.\n  802.11n utilizes multiple wireless antennas in tandem to transmit and receive data. The associated term MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple\n  Output) refers to the ability of 802.11n and similar technologies to\n  coordinate multiple simultaneous radio signals. MIMO increases both\n  the range and throughput of a wireless network.\n\nIn short, the 802... protocols have not much to do with the Antenna (there are no individual Antenas for each protocol), but the frequency does. The 5Gig does not have wide range then the 2.5Gig, it only allows faster data transfer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now to the numbers:\n\n\nTo make it simple.

I use some keyboard shortcuts on my iPhone. This helps a lot, e.g. when typing gn which is replaced by Good night!. These shortcuts are synchronised to my Mac via iCloud.  On my Mac I use TextExpander as a sophisticated keyboard shortcut tool and don’t need these iOS shortcuts, as I have hundreds of Mac abbreviations and don’t need shortcuts that work on a phone but not elsewhere.\nThe answer to my question is pretty obvious: All I have to do is to unable System Preferences → iCloud → Documents & Data. However, a lot of apps rely on this setting being enabled. \nWhat else can I do to prevent the synchronization/use of these abbreviations on my Mac?\n\nA: You have answered your own question, the syncing is included with lots of other things and granular settings are not available.  The only way around it is to use just text expander on both iOS and OSX, or just the default text substitution tools, but not a mix.  Sorry!\n\nA: Yes there is a quick solution.\nOn any Apple app: Go to Edit>Substitutions and UNCHECK \"Text Replacement\".\nHope this helps!\n\n\nA: I agree with you. I'm not a fan of turning off a primary feature of an unrelated service to solve an issue like this. It's not really a solution.\nAccording to TextExpander's support there's no mention of official iCloud syncing. You may want to check to see if you have the Local Network syncing option on by mistake.\nTextExpander's page on syncing\nIf that doesn't do it, here's the reality and this will probably come as a surprise to you... iCloud syncs all kinds of settings & data between devices (iOS & Mac) without you knowing it or explicitly allowing it. I've done a great deal of digging lately into how & what iCloud syncs and it's pretty upsetting. I'm seeing documents & preferences being pushed to iCloud for apps that don't have any official iCloud support. I've yet to figure out why some of these apps are immune to the situation, but I'm guessing that apps developed using newer versions of Apple's development software (XCode) are putting their settings/documents in places that get picked up by iCloud without the developer even realizing it.\nIn my experience, Mac apps that have an iOS counterpart are sharing information without being listed under Documents & Data in System Preferences. Basically Apple seems to be automating some syncing for newly developed apps on all their platforms and they've either failed to prevent inadvertent sharing that the developer didn't intend or they're intentionally doing this in silent thinking they're doing someone a favor. Either way, it's pretty sloppy on Apple's part.\nI'd suggest contacting the developer of TextExpander so they're aware of the issue. In the meantime, if it is silent syncing, there's nothing you can manually do to stop it other than your above solution. \nThis next part I only offer as evidence of what I'm talking about, not to suggest you delete anything from the location I mention. Doing so could create problems and in my tests things just came back during the next sync.\nNone of the next steps will harm or change anything on your computer. It just opens a folder that's typically hidden. You can close the Finder window when done and no harm will be done.\nOn your Mac make the Finder active.

I work at a company that has both POP3 and IMAP email servers. The POP3 server is at pop3.mycompany.com and the IMAP is at imap.mycompany.com. We've noticed that when setting up email accounts in iOS7 it will default to the POP server. I was personally wondering how iOS detects these settings and what it would take to prefer IMAP over POP, or if that's possible. It's worth noting that neither server has SSL enabled currently.\n\nA: I'm not really sure whether the iOS discovery algorithm is documented anywhere public in its entirety.\nThe standard way of doing this though is to setup SRV records in DNS to let clients know, which servers are available.\nFor IMAP (without SSL as you requested) you would setup a SRV record such as:\n_imap._tcp     SRV 0 1 143 imap.mycompany.com.\nFor POP3 you could have a record like this:\n_pop3._tcp     SRV 10 1 110 pop3.mycompany.com.\nThe priority in those two lines are 0 and 10, meaning that the client should prefer IMAP over POP3.\nA different way of going about this could be to add a SRV record for Microsofts autodiscover mechanism. That SRV record redirects the client to a file called autodiscover.xml that you must host on a web server. That XML-file then contains the details of your servers.\n", "Q: Xcode file disabled/deleted My computers hard drive is full, and while I edited a .h file in xcode it said it can't be autosaved (obviously), but then the file name in the navigation area turned red and I wasn't able to get into the file.

In Ask Different there are similar threads (e.g. Choosing hexadecimal web colours), but unfortunately no one is resolutive for me.\nThe perfect solution would be Hex Color Picker (a plugin for the standard picker), because it goes beyond picking allowing to edit/create swatches also. Unfortunately, it does not work for me: for some reason the hex picker returns wrong hex values. E.g. a full red image (#ff0000) created in photoshop, is evaluated as #f70016 (see image below). I tested this behaviour picking both from Photoshop and from an exported .png opened in browser. Both in Maverick and Mountain Lion.\nCan you suggest me an alternative solution or a fix for this issue?\n\n\nA: Test it and you'll see that Photoshop is guilty for not rendering in the same color space. \nYou need to change the color profile of your image in photoshop. \n\nA: Just use DigitalColor Meter that ships with Osx: to turn on hex visualization go to\nView > Show values > Hexadecimal (I've got it in italian so it can translated slightly different)\n\n\n\nA: Jesper, the creator of Hex Color Picker here.\nIn most cases, clicking Options in the Hex Color Picker part of the color picker and toggling the check box mentioning calibrated colors will do the trick. The triangle at the top right means that the color is a device color, i.e. that it has been changed, and that the color code is the color after the correction.\nI have come to the conclusion that it may be impossible to always pick the right color code for a number of reasons, or at least that it is well beyond my understanding. I have gone several back-and-forths with different people at various points in time, and no solution worked for all scenarios. I think in those cases, it may come down to either or both of color calibration on the display color profile and special color space adjustments in the particular application - the magnifying glass (which by the way is part of the OS X color panel and provided by it since it shows up in all the other pickers too) just doesn't know what it's picking at that point.\nThat said, there are simpler cases than that that still mess up. I am still a novice in color management (although not for a lack of trying) and I would be delighted to be proven wrong. The source code to Hex Color Picker is available for anyone to fiddle with, and it is effectively abandonware by now. I still use it myself but I mostly don't have the opportunity to get anything done on it.\nI also use Developer Color Picker, which may or may not have these problems.\n\nA: Oh sorry..

When I try to open it by double clicking it, nothing happens. When I use the terminal I get the following message:\n\nLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file .../xxxx.app\n\nI tried several suggestions that I found here like changing permissions and modifying the Info.plist file, but nothing works.\nBecause it's a Java application, I tried to run it through terminal using \n\njava -cp \"CLASSPATH\" MAINCLASS \n\nand it works fine.\nJust to mention that I get this error not only with this app, but for a few other applications.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The LSOpenURLsWithRole is a function that is used to associate a file with a program. The file you're double clicking on is not actually an application, but a data file. \nThis is how, for example, when double-clicking a text document, the TextEdit program or another associated app is launched.\nYou need to associate it with the java runtime, assuming that you have it installed.\nIf you right-click on the file and select Get Info, the info pane has a section called \"Open With:\". That should be set to the java runtime.\n\nA: For anyone coming here who is seeing this issue for a non-Java program: I was getting the same error message when trying to run a .app file which contains a Mach-O executable. Trying to run the executable directly from within the bundle (e.g. Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/bar) gave me a much better error indicating I was missing a dynamic lib dependency:\ndyld: Library not loaded:/usr/local/opt/qt5/lib/QtWidgets.framework/Versions/5/QtWidgets\nSomething to try if you are seeing this error.\n\nA: I was also encountering this error with a Java program I was trying to deploy. I could not get it to work on my second Mac: 10.11.6. I looked everywhere for the answer, but never found one, so I'm putting this here for others to benefit. By launching the System Console, I discovered the error message that the \"open\" program could not find the program \"JavaApplicationStub\" in the bundle Contents. The problem is, my bundle was using \"JavaAppLauncher\" to launch. I had just changed from using the old Apple JarBundler to the Oracle AppBundler so I could sign the app, and the launch program name is different. The key here is that the new bundle (version 7.1.1) was replacing the old one (version 7.1.0), and had the same application name. The old one used JavaApplicationStub to launch. \nIt appears the Info.plist properties for the program were cached, and it was using stale values to launch the new bundle. Don't know if the cache is cleared on logout or reboot, or if this is fixed in newer versions of OS X, but I have to have this work smoothly for all end users. \nI got around the problem by including the version number in the program name. \n", "Q: How to never logout and never retype password App store Apple App store is really annoying with all their security.

I'm a system administrator, and I daily receive reports from several mail servers which contain thousands to tens of thousands of email addresses written as plain text (logwatch, from a Postfix server) mentions.  When one of these is selected as the active message, Mail hangs for up to 30-45 seconds with the spinning beach ball cursor as it converts all those addresses and also message-ID strings to hyperlinks.

From the start, it's had issues connecting to our LAN. Other computers, including my 2011 MacBook Pro, connect fine. \nI've tried multiple times running the Wireless Diagnostics and connection wizards that come with the Air, which offer no help. The Air also can connect to the router via Ethernet and gets the Internet connection, but obviously we don't want to do that all the time. \nMy mother brought her Air to her work today and connected to that Wifi network without issue. \nAt home, our computers connected to the Internet run an IP address in the range of 173.195.x.x. Hers runs at 166.x.x.x whenever it doesn't connect properly, but if I renew the DHCP lease a couple times and keep switching settings randomly then I can connect the Air to the network until the Air sleeps. It's an unreliable method.\nSpecifically, the Air has this IP address but does not say this address is self-assigned. It also does not tell me that I 'won't be able to connect the Internet'. \nMy suspicion is currently with the router. It's about 3.5+ years old at this point, a Netgear WND3400 N600. I think it may just be that it's a wireless-n and the Air is wireless-ac, but the Air should be backwards-compatible. \nI haven't updated the firmware on the router, I'm about to do so now. \nDoes anyone have any ideas for me to try out?\n\nA: Ok so, there is an option to manually connect to your Router/LAN.

When connecting to a URL via HTTPS and the SSL certificate doesn't match (such as at a paid Wi-Fi hotspot), iOS shows a dialog asking whether the certificate should be accepted. If you accept the certificate, iOS adds an SSL exception and will never ask about that certificate again.\nThere are possibly two aspects to this: certificates accepted in Safari, and certificates accepted for network services in other apps.\nThe question is, how does one remove these exceptions, short of a full device reset? There seems to be no way to view or remove exceptions in the device settings.\n\nA: You can delete the SSL certificate.\nGo to Settings → General → Reset → Network Settings.\nThis resolves the problem.\n[EDIT]\nAs of iOS 10.3.2 this does NOT work. Instead it wipes out your network settings, but does NOT remove certificate exceptions. \n\nA: I found a nice blog post that gives some good information and tips regarding ssl certificates.\n\nOnce the SSL exception is added there doesn’t seem to be a way to remove it in iOS 7. In previous versions going to Settings->Safari and selecting ‘Clear Cookies and Data’ would delete it. This no longer seems to work in iOS 7....\n\n--\n\nTo remove the SSL exception on Safari on iOS 7.0.4 you can reset all settings (General > Reset > Reset Settings). Unfortunately it deletes all your settings (go figure); but it's one huge step better than a full restore that makes you lose your text messages.\n\n\nI found instructions on how to do this in iOS 6 here and also here with pictures. This probably also works in iOS 5 but I cannot confirm (the Profiles page mentioned below likely doesn't appear until there are installed certificates to view or delete).

Select \"General\" from the list of options that appear in the drop-down menu.\n\n\n*Select \"Profiles\" from the list of options that appear and a list of all the certificate on your iPhone will appear on screen.\n\n\n*Scroll through the list of certificates until you come to the one you would like to remove from your iPhone and click the \"Remove\" button on the screen. The certificate will then be removed. Repeat the process for any other certificates you would like to remove.\n\n\nYou can also manage certificates with the Apple Configurator in Mavericks, the iPhone Configuration Utility in Mountain Lion, Lion and Snow Leopard, and there is a Windows version. There are instructions available.\n\nInformation on how this changed in iOS 7.\n\nSSL Detective\nFrom my comment above, check out SSL Detective for iOS. As far as I've seen, it's the only iOS app of it's kind, and may help you determine which certificates you'd like to delete.\n\nA: Another one for SSL Detective. For some reason the last iOS 6 compatible version of an app I use daily suddenly stopped working with an Untrusted Root Certificate error saying \"The authenticity of \"GeoTrust Primary Certification Authority - G3\" cannot be verified.\" I could have used SSL Detective's \"Email Certs\" feature to just install the cert and trust it myself, but that wouldn't have gotten to the ROOT Cause of the issue.

We are using an Iomega file storage which is connected to our network. Our Windows Domain Controller is creating a share to this file storage, so our Windows users can easily access the share using \\domaincontroller\\share\nWhen those users create a new folder, the file/directory permissions are inherited from the parent's folder. Everybody can read/write in their newly created folders, which is perfect.\nWhen a Mac user (which is directly accessing the file storage) is creating a new folder, special permissions (read/write for current user) are applied and no else can write files in this newly created folder. The only way to solve this, is to RDP to a Windows console and reset the ACL's.\nWhat's the best practice to solve this problem?\n\nA: By default, Active Directory objects inherit ACEs from the security descriptor located in their parent container object. Inheritance enables the access control information defined at a container object in Active Directory to apply to the security descriptors of any subordinate objects, including other containers and their objects. This eliminates the need to apply permissions each time a child object is created. \nIf necessary, you can change the inherited permissions. However, as a best practice, avoid changing the default permissions or inheritance settings on Active Directory objects. For more information, see Best practices for assigning permissions on Active Directory objects and Changing inherited permissions.\n", "Q: Switch wireless keyboard/trackpad while using iMac as external monitor I have an iMac with a pair of wireless keyboard/trackpad and another Macbook Pro (MBP).

I'm planning on getting a SSD but that will take a while to ship. \nThe tech at the Apple Store suggested a clean install of Mavericks from a USB stick, which is what I'm going to attempt next. (if that doesn't work I'll probably try this as kernel_task seems to be taking up a lot of memory and CPU usage)\nIs there a way to do a clean install but keep all of my apps, preferences, etc.? Could I just make a Time Machine backup and restore from it?\n\nA: \nIs there a way to do a clean install but keep all of my apps, preferences, etc.? Could I just make a Time Machine backup and restore from it?\n\nShort Answer : Yes you can. OS X has an App called \"Migration Assistant\" that is located in \"/Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app\", which can easily restore user-chosen stuff from a backup or an external HDD or external Server Partition or a Thumb drive if you wish to do so.\nThe Long Answer :\nAs a clean install is always helpful, don't try to simply run away from your problems. OS X can be a very sensitive System and Mavericks has its problems.\n(And thank god there is Stackexchange for every Problem that might occur)\nI would consider using certain tools to clean your mac and make sure it is checked carefully. Some common Apps are OnyX or CleanMyMac.\nAlso try creating a whole new user and compare the performance with your own account. Using this way you can find out if there is something in your account that makes your machine so slow or if it is the overall System.\nAlso try using the PRAM and SMC -reset, Boot your mac from a recovery partition or CD/DVD to repar the Disk if neccessary or to check if everything is ok.\nIf nothing changes during all your steps, a clean install is your last resort. If even this does not seem to fix the problem it won't be a software issue and you should take the Computer to an Apple Store for Hardware checks. (you can use the build-in hardware check first if you want to save some time)\n", "Q: /Library/Java - deleted it, how to restore?

I've never seen these characters before and never seen them in action either.\nDoes anybody know what they are and what they're used for?\nMaybe somebody has this drop of trivia lying around...\nOption+Shift+6\n\nﬂ\n\nOption+Shift+5\n\nﬁ\n\n\nA: These are U+fb01 and fb02, Latin Small Ligature Fl and Fi.  They are in Unicode really only because they were contained in legacy 8 bit character sets like MacRoman, but should no longer be used for anything.  In modern technology such ligatures are created by fonts on the basis of the underlying codes for the separate characters, which is what should aways be input in place of option shift 5/6.\n\nA: They are called ligatures and they are from the days of metal typesetting. 2 letters that commonly occurred together would be forged as one piece of metal type. Nowadays on the computer, they are sometimes included in fonts, in order to make a more pleasing letter group. They are not special characters, really it is just supposed to be letters f and i drawn together.\n\nA: They are U+FB02 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FL and U+FB01 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI, which are ligatures encoded as separate characters. According the Unicode FAQ on ligatures, they “exist basically for compatibility and round-tripping with non-Unicode character sets” and “Their use is discouraged.” However, in many contexts, they are the only way to get such ligatures.\nAdvanced rendering software may be able to map character pairs like “fi” and “fl”, written using normal Ascii characters, to ligature glyphs, usually depending on software settings. However, most text editors and word processors cannot handle that.\nDepending on font, you might have good reasons for using ligatures. In some fonts, e.g. an “fi” combination looks bad (maybe with the “f” almost hitting the dot of “i”), unless a ligature is used.\nYet, keyboard shortcuts for the ligature characters are not very useful. If you decide to use such characters, it is usually better to type the text normally, then run a global replace where e.g. “fi” and “fl” (and maybe “ffi” and “ffl”) are changed to ligature characters.\n\nA: The search tern to use is ligature\nﬂ and ﬁ are ligatures i.e. the two characters are joined together as one thing (Wikipedia says glyph).   This is just how typesetters think make the text look better so is a design idea makes ﬂ look better that fl and ﬁ better than fi\nThe only thing I have seemed them used for explicitly is the abbreviation for florin ﬂ which used to be the Dutch currency.\n", "Q: How to find my password for iCloud My Apple computer is about 6 years old.

If you run a retina display at exactly half resolution (i.e. 1280x800 on a 13\" Retina MacBook Pro [native 2560x1600]), that it will not look blurry at all and will look the same as if the display was native resolution.\nIs this true?\nI've tried using these half-resolutions but they look extremely jagged.  I wouldn't describe it as blurry, but it definitely looks pretty awful.\nHowever, if I use the same resolution (1280x800) on a native panel (i.e. MacBook Air 1366x768), it looks MUCH better.\nWhat's going on here?\nWhy doesn't half-resolution on Retina look the same as a panel with the same native resolution?\n\nA: It depends of what you mean by \"will look the same\".\nIt looks the same only in the way that the elements on your screen are displayed in the same size as if it was a 1280x800 screen.\nThe aim of the retina displays is to display more details, to do that, what it does is that it displays things at the same size a half resolution screen would have done but uses all the available pixels to show you more details, nothing is better than an example to explain you what I mean :\n\nIn fact, the pixels of a retina display are designed to be small enough so that you retina won't be able to distinguish them at a standard use distance, that's why it looks as sharp as a printed page, and that's why a retina display will never look the same as a display that would be natively 1280x800 pixels, actually it should looks much better.\nNow let's answer to your question ! You didn't explained if it always looks blurry or only on some applications/websites.\nI will assume that it does not always looks blurry because it shouldn't.\nAs I explained, although they are displayed in the same size than on any other display, the elements are \"constituted\" of 4 times more pixels which means that an element that would have been 10x10 pixels (100 pixels) needs to be 20x20 pixels (400 pixels) to take advantage of all the available pixels ; it looks blurry if the element hasn't got a resolution that's high enough \"to fill all the available pixels\", in fact, this is exactly like when a picture is pixelated but here it looks more blurry because the pixels of your screen are extremely small.\nThere should be more and more retina ready websites/applications in the future (in think that in something like 4 years most of the websites will be).\n\nA: The real 1280x800 on native 2560x1600 will generally looks similar to native 1280x800, unless there is subpixel font rendering.\nSubpixel font rendering use colored pixels that fit the display subpixel (RGB) cells to smooth font edge. When naively zooming 1 pixel to 4, the colored pixels does not fit the subpixel cell anymore, and then it will 'look extremely jagged'.\n\nPS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Subpixel font rendering is turned off by default in Mojave\n\n*'Looks like 1280x800' (aka 1280x800 HiDPI) is not real 1280x800.

If you setup a standard user and create any file, a list of that file in the terminal with 'ls -la' shows the user group to be 'staff'.\nUsing the dscacheutil command, we can see information about groups. For example: -\ndscacheutil -q group -a name admin\n\nThis returns information about the admin group, including all the members.\nHowever, when used to look at the 'staff' group, I expected to see standard users as members of the group, but this is not the case: -\ndscacheutil -q group -a name staff\n\nname: staff\npassword: *\ngid: 20\nusers: root\n\nSo, if all standard users are members in the staff group, why do they not appear here? \nIs there another command which can show the real members of the staff group?\n\nA: What exactly do you want to achieve/do?\nThis command lists all users in the staff group:\ndscl . -list /Users PrimaryGroupID | grep ' 20$'\n\nSource\nExplanation: The staff group has the PrimaryGroupID of 20.\n\nA: There's only one reliable way to get all members of a group in OS X and the reply from 2DD8847 covers that. As for \"why\" I can't offer a logical explanation. All I can tell you is what differentiates the results.\nThese approaches fail to include users that are only members of the group via PrimaryGroupID. One way to think of it is that these users not listed weren't officially added to the staff group. They were just given a PrimaryGroupID that matches the staff gid. Therefore they're not officially listed with some commands. I know, it's absurd.\nINCOMPLETE RESULTS:\ndscl . -read /Groups/[groupname]\ndscl . -read /Groups/[groupname] GroupMembership\ndscacheutil -q group -a name [groupname]\n\nCOMPLETE RESULTS:\ndscl . -list /Users PrimaryGroupID | grep [gid]\n\nAll I can really tell you is that without looking up group members by their PrimaryGroupID (instead of listing members of a group) it won't give you complete results.

Following the introduction of Lion, Quicktime became apart of the OS X installation package. There is no need to take a roundabout method. Reinstallation using recovery is non-destructive and only reinstalls OS X builtin applications and system components. \n\nA: I asume that you mean 'Quicktime Player 10' when you are talking about Quicktime.\nQuicktime uses 'components' to open specific formats, like wmv or mp3. There is are multiple locations where components can be stored. To my knowlegde these are:\n/System/Library/QuickTime , /Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components, ~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components and ~/Library/QuickTime (the latter three do not exist by default or are empty)\nIt is likely that that Quicktime uses a third party component to play mp3 files and that the third party component does not work properly. Components in your homefolder might be responsible for this. My suggestion would be to go (in Finder press shiftcommandG) to the previous mentioned locations, remove all the files in these locations, but keep the following standard components in (/System/Library/QuickTime):\n(I have OS X Mavericks as a reference, no Mountin Lion but the list 'should' be quite similar)\nAppleGVAHW.component           QuickTimeH264.component\nApplePixletVideo.component     QuickTimeIIDCDigitizer.component\nAppleProResDecoder.component   QuickTimeImporters.component\nAppleVAH264HW.component        QuickTimeMPEG.component\nQuartzComposer.component       QuickTimeMPEG4.component\nQuickTime3GPP.component        QuickTimeStreaming.component\nQuickTimeComponents.component  QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component\nQuickTimeFireWireDV.component  QuickTimeVR.component\n\nMove all non similar components out of your Quicktime library (keep a copy) and try playing your mp3's. I am not sure if a logout is required.\nIf this does not work, you might require to install your components, but I think that is highly unlikely.\nps.  (make backups...)\n\nA: Both CousinCocaine and njboot are correct and extremely helpful so try their steps and enlighten yourself. I would like to suggest something though. \nYou could spare yourself the reinstall process by installing 10.8 on a separate hard drive and running all possible updates on it. Once that is done you can copy over the Apple Quicktime components from the various locations listed by CC and nj and put them in the same spots on your normal drive. But since this requires having either spare machine or restarting your system for the install process then it is completely up to you. I personally have two drives in my computer, one with my working OS and the second with a minimal system where I can troubleshoot my main system and boot up to should the main drive file and continue my work mostly uninterrupted. \nAnd to repeat on CC... Make Backups! Leave a comment if I should go further into details but I just wanted to through an idea in the pot to try and help.\n", "Q: What password does OSX Server use when importing SSL certificates? I am migrating my website away from my home OSX server to a virtual Linux server, hosted within a proper data centre, and I have a problem with the SSL certificates I imported into OSX Server.\nIt appears to have stored the certificates into /etc/certificates however I don't know the passphrase it used to encrypted the key file.  It's not my normal account/keychain password, so I've no idea what passphrase it, or I, chose at the time.\n(I have tried to get the original SSL certificates but that's not proving so easy either, but might be my only hope).\nCould someone tell me how this works so I can untangle myself and use the certificates on the new website please?\n\nA: It looks like OP's problem has been solved, but for the record it's actually fairly easy to get the keys from OS X Server, as long as you have admin access to the server. I'll give you two ways to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Keychain Access utility on the server, select \"System\" from the Keychains list, then \"My Certificates\" from the Category list under that. Select the relevant certificate on the right side of the window, then from the File menu choose \"Export Items. In the export dialog, make sure the file format is set to \"Personal Information Exchange (.p12)\" to export both the private key and (public) certificate. It will ask for your admin name & password to get access to the keychain, then ask for a new password to encrypt the exported file with.\n\n*The certificate and associated private key are also stored (as you said) in /etc/certificates. Make sure you get both the certificate (filename ending \".cert.pem\") and matching private key (\".key.pem\"); you might also need the cert chain (\".chain.pem\"), which includes your certificate and the supporting certificates that vouch for its authenticity.\nThe private key file will be encrypted with a randomly-generated password. No problem; in order for server services to use this key, its password is stored (in the system keychain, actually) in a retrievable form. With admin rights, you can retrieve it the same way the web server does. Use this command (replacing server.example.com with the actual domain name):\nsudo /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/getsslpassphrase server.example.com:443 RSA\n\nIt'll require your admin password, then spit out what looks like a GUID. That's the encryption password for the .key.pem file.\n(Note: in older versions of OS X Server, getsslpassphrase was in /etc/apache2/ instead of /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/. Adjust as needed.)\n\nA: The actually \"certificate\" itself is not encrypted. Your private key, which is used with the certificate, is usually encrypted. It is encrypted with the passphrase you chose when you created the private key. You might have done that a while earlier than creating this specific certificate, if you have multiple certificates - so be sure to try \"old passwords\" if you have them.\nIf you cannot remember the passphrase for your private key, you're out of luck. You will not be able to use that specific certificate anymore. The certificate issuer will not be able to provide you with a copy of the private key, as they haven't got it.\nUsually you will be able to revoke your existing certificate and get your issuer to give you a new one - depending on your issuer that might come with a charge.\nAs you can buy new SSL certificates for less than 10$ today, it might not be worth the hassle to try and get the old one working. Just buy a new one.\n", "Q: How do I restore learned spelling from a backup? I have an old backup of my user Library and need to restore its previous learned spelling values.

I just installed it to my home directory. Also I put in my plist file in the ROOT column the name of the variable (f.ex. PATH) and in the Value column I typed in the exact string which is specified above behind the \"=\"-sign (f.ex. /Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-6.0/bin:$PATH).\n\nA: This is how it worked for me: \n1. Render invisible files visible.\n2. Then open the bash_profile in your home directory with any text editor and write down whatever you need to, f.ex.: \n'export PATH = /this/is/some/complete/path/name:$PATH'\nAdding ':$PATH' lets the system search for other pathnames stored somewhere else (so do that only when editing system variables). \n':' in general enables you to ad multiple paths.\n3. Don't forget to reload the affected files by typing into the bash 'source /filename', for the changes to take effect. \nOther problems you might encounter:\nWhen defining multiple variables be aware that it parses in order, so if you use f.ex.\n'export PATH = $ANOTHERPATH/some/directory' \nmake sure to define ANOTHERPATH before defining PATH. \nAnd make sure you really know your OS's file system.\n", "Q: What is /Users/me/Applications? I am on Mavericks (1.9.2) and I just noticed a folder called Applications in my home folder, i.e. I have a folder /Users/me/Applications.  This folder is empty:\ncd Applications\npwd\n/Users/me/Applications\nls -a\n./          ../         .localized\ncat .localized\n[nothing]\ncd\nls -lh\ndrwx------   3 me  staff   102B 19 Apr 21:08 Applications/\n\nI was wondering how did this folder came into being... this is admittedly a purely academic curiosity before I get rid of it. \n\nA: Anything can create ~/Applications.\nIt's usually used to store apps that you don't want to (or can't because you're not admin) install globally on the system. The folder doesn't exist by default, but if created it will be given a custom icon like /Applications. Any app on the system can create this folder and since no record of what app created it exists you probably won't know.\n\nA: /Users/<username>/Applications or ~/Applications is your user's Applications folder.  Much like your Desktop, Documents, et al., this folder is local to the user and can be changed by (natively) only that same user.  Very nice if you want to install an application for only yourself and no one else.\n/Applications is your system-level Applications folder, visible and accessible by all users on the system.  To make changes on the system-level, you must authenticate as an admin.\ngrgarside is right: the folder isn't there by default.  You can add it yourself or an installer (e.g. Spotify's installer) can create it for you.\n\nA: Just to add a little more context to the answers above... The only time I've ever seen any apps appear in here was when I installed older Adobe Air apps. I think the new Air subsystem properly places apps in the primary Applications folder. If you want an application only available to you (your user account) and not to other users you'd want to put the Application ~/Applications instead of the globally accessible /Applications folder. On OS X you can run an application from anywhere, so these aren't really super special folders as much as they're default folder locations with the purposes listed by \"thankyour\" already.\n", "Q: How can I keep keybindings of iTerm and vim apart 1.Enviroment\nEnv: vim+zsh+iTerm2 on Mac OSX 10.9.2.

Not even the mac equivalent of \"find my iphone\" 'play sound' will work. \nApple makes it very clear that power nap will not make any sounds and so it doesn't turn on the fans either, and will not work if it's too hot.\nPower Nap is a \"bonus\" mode for the sleep state where a limited amount of work will be done, but it's guaranteed not to disturb or even wake near by people.  \nIf you want alerts I guess you will have to  stop the computer from going into sleep mode\n", "Q: How to install reader on iOS 5 I have iPad 2 with iOS 5.1\nI am developer and I need it to test apps.\nBut 99% of time nobody use it.\nI decided to install ebook reader to reads fb2, mobi and other ebook formats.\nBut all readers I found do not install on iOS 5.\niOS 6 is minimal requirement.\nIs there way to install older version of app?\nOr upgrade just to iOS 6 (I know impossible)\nJailbreak? (I think it is impossible with version 5.1)\nI am looking for solution to get some reader to work on iOS 5.1\n\nA: Here's some information to keep in mind for the future. If you had ever installed a version of some app, then the App Store will allow you to continue either installing that app (if you had deleted it), or to install the last version compatible with that version of iOS. But if you never installed the app in question, Apple, the App Store will prevent you from installing it, even though there is obviously a version from App Store that will install if they'd let you. This is Apple's restriction and not something the individual app developers can decide.\nJailbreaking provides many options, but in my experience, introduces some new problems. I am just astounded by what, in particular, the Dev Team has accomplished, and more so what Jay Freeman (aka saurik) nearly single-handedly has accomplished. Cydia existed before the App Store, and is an implementation of Debian linux Advanced Packaging Tool. Developers began selling software there a good 5 months before App Store existed, as far as the public was concerned.\nThe new problems introduced by jailbreaking are merely that you really need to keep on top of things, and things change pretty fast in the jailbreaking community, which you necessarily need to become a participating member of if you want your device to continue working, or ever need help from someone because something stopped working. By and large, I found everyone in the jailbreaking community to be refreshingly shocking, but ultimately gave me a really great experience with it. But once my curiosity was satisfied, I found that maintaining my jailbroken device required more effort and time than I had to spend on it.\nThat being said, I just purchased a new iOS device, on the way... and because I really can't stand iOS7, I intend to get reaquainted with the jailbreaking community to mitigate what I just can't stand about it.\nI recommend that you seek out more information from the dev team blog linked above, and also rediscover IRC, and the various jailbreaking IRC servers and channels, on Freenode and elsewhere (google helps), and involve yourself in that community in whatever positive way you can. And be patient with your desires. \nSorry for the magna carte here! And best of luck on your adventure!\n", "Q: How do I find out what my iBooks \"authorized computers\" are? I saw a \"Free\" book on iBooks today and decided to download it.  I've never used iBooks before.\nAfter it downloaded (and I entered my password), I clicked \"Read\", and iBooks said:\n\nComputer authorization was successful.\nYou have authorized 2 computers out of your available 5.\n\nI only have one Mac here.  (iBooks seems to be new with OS X 10.9, and this is the only Mac I've ever owned that is even capable of running 10.9.)  Is it including my old iPod Touch as a \"computer\"?  If not, how can I figure out what the other \"authorized computer\" is?\n\nA: The iBooks authorization count is the same count you get for iTunes Store. They're the same thing. This covers Books, Music, Movies, etc... If you go to the Store menu item from iTunes or iBooks you can click View My Apple ID, enter your password and then you'll see the authorization count.\nBasically if you have authorized another computer to use iTunes Store it counts as a computer authorized for that Apple ID. That's why you're seeing the count as 2. It's no longer just related to music. As Apple's info states on the Account Information screen:\n\n2 computers are authorized to use content purchased with this Apple ID\n\nIf you want to reset this, just click the Deauthorize All button and you can re-authorize your 1 computer to start fresh. You won't be able to see what computer it is, but you can see the count and reset it.\n", "Q: How do I upgrade my iOS on my iPad 1st generation? How do I upgrade my ipad 1st generation ios from iOS 5.1.1 to iOS 6.0 so that I can use more apps from the app store?\n\nA: You cannot. The first generation iPad simply does not support later iOS versions than 5.1.1.\n\nA: Besides that you can't do that, you really don't want to do that. The reason is the original iPad only has 256MB of DDR RAM. It's pretty amazing that Apple squeezed out so much wonderful functionality out of that puny amount of RAM (by today's standards). Subsequent versions of iPads doubled and quadrupled the amount of RAM, and subsequent versions of iOS has added many new and exciting features that would, if capable of running on the original iPad, cause it to slow it to a crawl and cause many \"out of memory\" crashes and reboots. \n", "Q: Install Windows on MacBook Pro, without OS X I installed Linux Mint on my 2006 MBP 15\" this weekend before hearing that the system will not enter a compatible firmware mode for Linux/Windows without rEFIt or rEFInd installed first.\nWell, I do not have another Mac available, and I do not have an OS X install disk to recover from (not 10.5 anyway).\nI can boot Linux by holding down CMD at boot, and launching the install from the Boot Manager, but this is much less than ideal, and while I imagine I can install Windows 7 much the same way I installed Mint, if I am still stuck with booting with CMD, my wide is not going to be happy (it is for her, and she is less than a Power User by any stretch).\nAny helpful advice out there?\n\nA: You're in luck! That machine will run Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, available from the Apple Store for $19.99. The Apple Store now has guaranteed next day delivery. Installing is very simple -- just insert the disk and hold down the c key on boot and follow the easy on screen instructions. Installation should only take 20-30 minutes. If you need help installing, you can take it to any of the Apple Retail Stores and they will install the System for you. But there is still plenty of online support from Apple and the web to get you back up and running quickly.\nIf you want to run a Linux or Windows desktop, since the hardware supports virtualization, then I still recommend leaving Mac OS X intact on the hardware, and, unless you need it for gaming, run the other systems in a virtual machine. This way the systems you work in will fully support the hardware, and there will be no performace degradation. With virtualization software like Parallels Desktop 6 for Mac you can run virtual machines in full screen, and never even know that OS X is running. Also available for free is Virutal Box; here is a download link for a version that will work in Snow Leopard.\nOnce OS X is installed, you can also install Windows or Linux directly on the hardware using BootCamp, and have a dual+ booting machine.\nIn general, its a good idea to leave Mac OS X on the mac hardware, as removing it will reduce your options.\n", "Q: I have an older macbook air and it keeps restarting and wont load pass the apple sign, whats wrong with it? It just keeps reloading and reloading and it wont load pass the apple sign and it does it for hours. I just want to know whats wrong with it or if im going to have to take it in to a computer place.\n\nA: When powering up your MacBook Air, hold down the Command key and the R key. This will start the OS X Recovery system. From there you'll be able to reinstall the system (you can keep your installed programs and your data files) - which could fix the problem.\nIf the recovery system does not come up, it could be because your computer is too old to have it (i.e. it is older than the 2008 model). In that case, let us know which model of the MacBook Air you've got.\nAnother thing to try is to use another computer to create a OS X Recovery USB drive. You can find the download and instructions for that here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1433\nIf neither works, you either have a hardware defect of some sort or need someone a little more trained on reloading the OS and triaging whether your boot issue is hardware or software. Lastly, the computer people will likely just systematically go through the following article and there's no reason you can't start that process as well and ask here when you end up with a failed step.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2570 - Troubleshooting a Mac that starts to a grey screen \n\n", "Q: Lightweight PDF reader with auto refresh I'm looking for a PDF reader that is both light weight and automatically updates the PDF to pickup background changes (e.g. when a LaTeX file is edited and compiled). There are two very good choices that fit the requirements but the auto refresh capabilities come with a minor hindrance in each:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preview — The background modifications are not picked up until the app regains focus. This is quite annoying when working if I need to keep tabbing/clicking to Preview and back to pick up the changes.\n\n*Skim — A confirmation dialog pops up the first time, asking what it should do with the background changes. Clicking \"Auto\" makes it behave exactly like I want. However, if I happen to close the window, it prompts you for the confirmation again.\nAt this point, I'd even be happy with a solution that \"fixes\" the problem in either of these apps. If there was some way to make Skim not ask any confirmation at all (forever use \"Auto\") or ask it just once per file and not per window, it would be perfect. \nIf this is not possible, recommendations for alternate viewers are welcome. I do not require any other features typical in PDF readers, such as annotations, tabbed reading, bookmarks, etc.\n\nA: You can configure Skim to do this by executing \ndefaults write -app Skim SKAutoReloadFileUpdate -boolean true\nWhich is a hidden preference:\n\nWhen this is true, and Skim checks for file updates on disk, the document is automatically reloaded without asking when there are no notes or edits. We don't recommend using this.\n\nNote: Preferences → Sync → Check for file changes needs to be enabled if you haven’t already done so.\n(I've tested this with Skim 1.4.8 and TL2013).\n", "Q: Installing ruby to specific directory/usb I am trying to install ruby to a specific directory, a USB stick, so I can move the usb back and forth without having to install ruby on each machine I get to (I need ruby 2.0+). How can I do this?\nI have been looking after stuff like setting RVM install directory and so forth, with no luck. The closest I found was this description telling me how to move the entire RVM install, which I don't want. I just want a simple ruby version on a usb stick.\nOn windows this was very easy: Run RubyInstaller, and point it to the USB. On OSx, well, that's another story.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: So I figured this out:\nWhat you must do is download the ruby source, and extract it wherever. Then you have a folder named ruby-2.1.2, or something reflecting your ruby version.\nThen, in terminal, cd to that directory. Then run:\n./configure --prefix=/Volumes/USB_STICK_NAME/folder/to/install/into/osx_ruby\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nProtip: drag-n-drop the ubs-folder you want into the terminal to get the desired folder path. Much easier than writing it\nThat will install ruby into your usb-stick named \"USB_STICK_NAME\" under the folders folder/to/install/into/osx_ruby. Feel free to name it differently, but remember; The folder you select as install directory is where all the internal ruby stuff ends up,  like bin, lib. I would recommend naming that folder \"osx_ruby\" or something similar.\nHope someone finds this useful.\n", "Q: Writing special characters to the clipboard with the command line I'm trying to write the string あいうえお to my clipboard using the pbcopy command line tool like this\necho あいうえお | pbcopy\n\nBut what I'm getting in my clipboard is completely different : „ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åà„Åä.\nI assumed this had something to do with the encoding, but the documentation says the encoding is based on the LANG environment variable and mine is set to en_EN.UTF-8.\n\nA: I think your LANG=en_EN.UTF-8 is the problem.\nWhen I execute this command\nprintf あいうえお | LANG=en_EN.UTF-8 pbcopy\n\nand paste into a new TextEdit document I get „ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åà„Åä (incidentally, this is what you get if take the the UTF-8 encoding of your original text and decode it as MacRoman; you should be able to verify this by doing printf あいうえお | iconv -f macroman).\nWhen I execute this command\nprintf あいうえお | LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbcopy\n\nand paste into a new TextEdit document I get あいうえお, just as one would expect.\n\nI am pretty sure that en_EN.UTF-8 is not a valid locale (thus pbcopy is defaulting to MacRoman). Maybe you meant to use en_US.UTF-8 (i.e. US, not EN)? You can list the valid locales by running locale -a. If you are just interested in English UTF-8 locales, you can filter the list like this:\nlocale -a | grep '^en_.*\\.UTF-8$'\n\n\nA: More than likely its your Terminal. Enter the command locale and see what it says there. If it doesn't list some Japanese encoding, that's probably what it is. Also, try selecting \"Unicode (UTF-8)\" as the Character encoding from Preferences..., Settings, Advanced, International. Also play around with Preferences / Encodings, enabling the Japanese encodings (is that Japanese? idk! LOL).\nAlso make sure to set LANGUAGE=\"en_US.UTF-8\" in your .bash_profile if it doesn't appear when you use the locale command.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Battery Problems I have a MacBook Pro late-2012 model.\nAnd my cable started showing symptoms of fraying.\nSo I ordered an offbrand cable from Amazon with good reviews and it arrived today and I tried it and the Mac recognized that it was getting power but the percent won't go up it's stuck at 95% but when I click on the battery icon in the status bar it says Battery Is Charged same thing with the original MagSafe but I just noticed this behavior now.\nBut with the MagSafe it would reach 98% sometimes and stop other times it would go to 100.\nShould I just ignore this or do something?\n\nA: It is common for the Macs battery to stop charging around 93-98%. It does it to prolong the overall life of the battery. Plus, your battery will have some wear and tear now depending on how many charge cycles you have used up.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1446#Troubleshooting\nBut if your MagSafe adapter is charging to 98% consistently and the off brand one is not, then the new cable is a suspect. Charging on Apple devices depend on several factors and there is some intelligence built into the battery IC which I believe communicates with the adapter to tell it when to stop charging. I am not sure if an off brand adapter plays well with the battery IC.\n", "Q: How to switch Preview's full screen default setting from \"two-pages\" to \"continuous scroll\"?

However, when going into fullscreen mode, it switches to \"two-pages\" when, really, I want it to use whatever view mode I had it, in this case: \"continuous scroll\".\nAnyone know how to remedy this? Or perhaps suggest an alternative to Preview.app?\nI'm on Mavericks OSX 10.9.2.\n\nA: This worked for me.\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview kPVPDFDefaultPageViewModeOption 1\n\n\nA: As you know, per your question, the preferences in the Preview app only apply to documents when first opened. It seems that OS X has a built in default view for full screen documents. I tried a couple things...\n\n\n*\n\n*I opened a PDF to Full Screen and set the view to Continuous to see if this would stick and that view would be chosen next time I went full screen. Not the case.\n\n*I searched every preference file related to Preview (also using 10.9.2) and found no setting even indirectly related to a view setting specifically when in full screen.\n\n\nI'd say, doing what you want is either not possible at all or at best it'd require getting into a preference setting somewhere you wouldn't want to poke around with. My guess would be it's a setting inside Preview.app's package contents. Fooling around in there can get hairy\nAs an alternative to setting a new default, the keyboard shortcut to switch to Continuous view is:\nCMD+1\n\nSo you can just quickly hit that each time you go full screen and the view changes immediately. It's not exactly what you wanted, but it's a very fast alternative.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: defaults write com.apple.Preview kPVPDFDefaultPageViewModeOption\n\nthis setting is the same as \"Opening for the first time\" setting in PDF pane of Preview's Preferences.\n0 Continuous Scroll\n1 Single Page\n2 Two Pages\nIt didn't work for me in macOS 10.15.3 (19D76) as change this setting doesn't affect fullscreen PDF display mode.

OK, more precisely, I am curious about the things the first command does in addition to what the second one does. Is it necessary to use a -log level panic argument?

But the additional arguments in the first one are confusing me and I didn't find much help in the ffmpeg documentation either. In particular, I want to understand what the -ac, -ar, and -ab arguments accomplish and why are they not used in the second command.\n\nA: ffmpeg duplicates syntax. Except for the values used, and that the first command set the sampling rate instead of using the default, the commands are effectively the same:\n -loglevel panic  - merely makes ffmpeg less noisy in the shell\n -vcodec copy     = -c:v copy\n -acodec copy     = -c:a copy   # unlisted in the command, but listing here to show there is consistency\n -ab              = -b:a\n\nNote: The other answer info is correct. \nThere is a guide online; it lists what every possible argument means.     \n\nA: The three flags ask for a 2 channel, 48000 Hz sampled, 160k bit rate encoded audio track.\nThe flags that can be passed to ffmpeg are listed in the ffmpeg manual page.

Starting in safe mode does nothing. \nWonder if anyone else has run into this problem?\n\nA: I had the same issue. Tried working offline - nothing.  Finally SUCCESS!  I unchecked the \"sync to server\" box that was checked and set to \"every two minutes.\"  The constant syncing must have hung up the program.  Accounts deleted without an issue after that.  I have Outlook 2011 on a Mac.\n\nA: It's usually caused due to a corrupt Outlook 2011 database. \n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Outlook 2011\n\n*Hold down the OPTION key, and then open Outlook again -> Microsoft Database Utility.app shows up\n\n*Click the identity of the database that you want to rebuild, and then click Rebuild.\n\n\nA: I'm having the exact same issue - Moved from Exchange to Exchange Online/365 and I can't remove the old account from Outlook for Mac 2011 (using Settings / Accounts / Delete). Outlook crashes every time. \nSame if I go into Work Offline mode, unfortunately.\nAfter some googling, I found this link to manually remove the account:\nhttps://php.radford.edu/~knowledge/lore/article.php?id=400\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down Outlook\n\n*Delete the folder ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/Main Identity and its subfolders.\n\n\nThis will remove everything from outlook, so if you have more than the 1 account set up, they will all be deleted. But it's a clean start.\nWorked for me, as I only had the old Exchange account(s) so they all needed to be deleted anyway.\nThen add the O365 account back, or even better, download the new version of Outlook for Mac (2015) and use it.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Here's the issue I had.  Two accounts because we migrated to Office365.  Tried to remove the old account and Outlook (2011) crashed.  From then on, every time I'd try to remove the account, Outlook would crash.  My plan was to make a pst backup, and just manually remove all account info via squall's method above, but at the end of creating the pst file, Outlook crashed again.  This automatically prompted the Microsoft Database Recovery Tool to open, and it recreated her entire profile.  After this tool ran its course, I was able to delete the old email account without issue (I put Outlook in offline mode to delete the account, just in case).\n\nA: I had the same issue in Outlook 2015 and deleting the \"Main Identity\" folder worked for me.

Much appreciated!\nThe closest problem I've found is here, this is a FAT partition.\nUnable to increase Macintosh HD partition size with data in a subsequent partition\n\nA: iPartition\nFor all my partitioning, I use and recommend iPartition. It will allow you to resize partitions without deleting any data. It will automatically move partitions if necessary to allow resizing into free space that is located after the partition.\n\niPartition’s ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when necessary, makes iPartition the easiest partitioning tool that you’ll ever use.\n\n\n\nA: GParted\niPartition has a non-functional demo mode, which is quite misleading. If you don't want to pay the $50 for it, the GParted live CD/USB is a good Free alternative.\nIt can't resize HFS+ partitions according to Wikipedia but it can copy and move them, and then you should be able to resize using the built-in Disk Utility.\n\nA: If you can format the blank space as MS-DOS, then Bootcamp Assistant should give you the option to \"Remove Windows 7\", and it should resize all your partitions back for you automatically.\nThe error you're getting is because it doesn't see a Windows installation to remove, and it doesn't support creating a new Windows installation in the situation you have.\n", "Q: Using Windows to boot up a hard drive with Mac OS in a virtual window I have the latest Mac OS X Mavericks installed onto a hard drive which I can boot from. As I mainly use a Windows machine, is there a way to boot up the hard drive in a virtual window on Windows, without having to reboot and change the BIOS drive boot order to access OS X Mavericks?\n\nA: First, understand that the Mac O/S is licensed only for use on Apple hardware, and as such doing what you want to do is not exactly legal...\nGenerally speaking it is possible to virtualize the Mac O/S. I, myself, have done this using Virtualbox and an older version of the O/S so I can run some older applications. That said this has been virtualized on Mac O/S, not in Windows like you want.\nHowever it should (YMMV) be possible to take a VM created in Virtualbox on a Mac and copy the files to a PC and run them in Virtualbox on a PC.\nHowever using an installation of Mac O/S on a physical hard drive, I kind of doubt it as PCs have no native way of reading or writing to HFS+ formatted disks. And it is likely that you have to install the O/S within the VM for it to work there.\nAlso you need special bootloaders and the like to run the Mac O/S on PC hardware. Such is called a Hackintosh and setting up the O/S to do so is a bit of a black art. But plenty of people do it. A bit of searching should pull up relevant links.\nThere are applications that will let you convert from physical (hard drive) to virtual (VM hard drive file) but I have no experience with that. It might work but depends on your interest in spending the time trying to get it to work.\n", "Q: Audio player that can adjust playing speed Please recommend an audio player for Mac that has features like\n\n\n*\n\n*freely available\n\n*can play .wav files\n\n*Adjust the playing speed (ex. 1.1x speed etc)\n\n*(if possible) truncate the audio file (ex. removing the last 5 minutes from the meeting recording)\n\n\nA: The VLC media player is probably best suited.\n\n\n*\n\n*It is Free\n\n*It plays .wav (and almost 100% of anything else out there)\n\n*It shows the Playback Speed settings.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It allows speed setting as fine as 0.04 X increments.\n\n\nA: You can use -r to change the playback rate with afplay:\nafplay -r 1.1 file.wav\n\n", "Q: When should I plug in my MacBook Pro? I have a MacBook Pro, and I want to keep its battery healthy for as long as possible.\nI've heard many \"myths\" about all these, one of them being that the battery will get \"hurt\" if I plug in the MacBook when its battery is high enough (higher than 75%), let it until it reach 100%, then unplug it.\nIs that true? Also, is it good to let the MacBook battery go to 0 then plug it?\n\nA: You are right lots of myths.\nand  more info this \"kb/ht1446\"\nApple Portables: Calibrating your computer's battery for best performance\nThe battery has an internal microprocessor that provides an estimate of the amount of energy in the battery as it charges and discharges. The battery needs to be recalibrated from time to time to keep the onscreen battery time and percent display accurate and to keep the battery operating at maximum efficiency. You should perform this procedure when you first use your computer and then every few months after that. If you normally leave your Apple portable computer connected to AC power and very rarely use it on battery power you may want to perform this process once a month.\n\n\n*\n\n*Portables with built-in batteries (aka MacBook Air)\n\n\nCurrent Apple portable computer batteries are pre-calibrated and do not require the calibration procedure outlined in this article.\nIn summary:\nThe battery has no memory effect & can be charged whenever you like. You can't overcharge it, & charging automatically stops when your battery is full.\nThe two biggest killers of Lithium batteries are heat & frequent full discharge/recharge cycles. \nFor calibration reasons (to make your battery status indicator accurate) you can discard but not less than 20% once in a few months.\nBest way to prolong the life is to keep it as cool as possible. That might mean do not take your lap top in your bed, do not keep it in the sun, ect.\n\nA: I can only offer my personal experience on this, but I strongly believe that constantly leaving the battery at full charge (i.e., always using the laptop plugged in), in conjunction with heat, is detrimental to the battery's life.  A lithium-ion or -polymer battery needs to be used--neither left at full charge or completely discharged for too long.  So, in addition to the recommendations in the KB article, I would recommend that you not keep the laptop running off the AC adapter if the battery is fully charged.\n", "Q: My MacBook re-boots when going into sleep - tips for analyzing problems? since a few days my 2010 MacBook Pro re-boots on a regular basis.

When I hit the arrow keys for scrolling, the delay appears too. I have read almost all posts about scrolling lags on OS X, but all issues I have found seem to be different. My machine is really fast and I cannot complaint about other performance issues. I'm using Chrome 34.0.1847.137 and my system is\n\nUsually, the issue shows as follows. I read a bit on the page, scroll down and the reaction on the screen is delayed. When I don't wait a few seconds between two scrolling actions, everything is fine. This is really annoying because after a while you really pay attention to this issue and it drives one crazy.\nI have tried to turn on the frame-rate monitor in Chrome, but this looks fine. Funny enough, it shows the same delay. During scrolling this monitor constantly tracks frame-rate. During the delays, the frame-rate monitor freezes too. \nI have tried to turn off extensions and tweak the chrome://flags/ settings without success. It seems like Chrome is going into some kind of hibernate after some seconds.\nI should mention, that no other applications show this behaviour. I have tried Safari which seems fine and in other applications I haven't noticed anything unusual.\nDoes anyone has a solution for this?\nAdditional information: I need to wait about 5 seconds without doing anything before the issue appears. So when I navigate, scroll, etc and then wait 5 sec, the scrolling delays. Every scroll-direction is infected: up, down, left and right.\n\nA: I too have this issue.  If you stop scrolling for 5 seconds because your reading, then go to start scrolling again, there is a freeze or delay of about 1 second.  its noticeable, and very annoying.  There are no viruses, and its not a plugin.  (I don't use chrome extensions or plugins.)  Safari doesn't have the issue, and its machine specific.  The identical Chrome on an older iMac, identical OS, doesn't have the issue.\nMy guess is that chrome has \"frozen\" the page, to save on CPU cycles, and has to release that and start live rendering it again when it sees you start scrolling.  Or maybe its a delay of swapping between graphics mode on the hardware...?\nSome interesting extra notes...if a text editor panel is open, such as the one you comment on here, the issue does not exist.  If an active video such as on youtube is playing in the window, then there is no lag scrolling either.\nIf you are scrolling up, there is never a delay, its only scrolling down that has the delay.\nYou see the mouse pointer change for the items that would be scrolling under it before you see the page even move.  So this indicates its some lower level thing that is going on, and most likely graphics related.\n\nA: I had exactly same issue and have just solved it. It was really simple, but I spent 20 minutes on it. Probably it is not the case for other people who posted here, but this is the only page I found googling, so may be this will help somebody else with same problem to save some time. \nI had a keyboard option \"Turn keyboard backlight off after 5 seconds\", and, apparently, it affected performance. I removed it and now everything is just fine.\nSorry for mistakes if any, English is not my native language.\n\nA: I have the EXACT same issue, also on a Mac Pro (6 Core). I restored all my files to this new Mac Pro via a Time Machine backup, and the source machine (a late-2013 15\" Retina MacBook Pro) doesn't have this issue at all.  I've done all the same things you have; resetting things, uninstalling some apps, removing Chrome and trying a fresh install, etc.\nOn any page that has scrolling, all I have to do is let the mouse sit for 5+ seconds and the next time I try and scroll there is a half-second to full-second pause. It does not occur in any other browser... just Chrome, and just on the Mac Pro.\nI'm completely lost on how to fix it... I even added a fresh user account on the Mac Pro to ensure it wasn't a bad plist file; didn't help in the least.\nEDIT - Added to Chrome bug tracker as requested!\n\nA: Identical problem.  Chrome Version 42.0.2311.135 (64-bit)\nAlso a MacPro.  Could it be happening only in MacPro?  Have to switch to Safari for now.  I have no problem with Chrome (identical settings) on MacBook.\n\n\nA: Problem seems to be fixed in Version 43.0.2357.81 (64-bit)\nHappy.\n\nA: I also have the Chrome Version 34.0.1847.137\nI have a MBA with ONLY 4Gig RAM \nThe scrolling in Chrome works very well (using the build in Trackpad)\nHere are some settings in Chrome to compare:\n\nSee the Disable Individual Plug ins !\nClick on it and it will open whole new page...\n\nDisable anything you do not use and then some more.\n\nA: This is probably due to power-saving feature for the GPU with the later Mac OS versions.  Turning off hardware acceleration (\"Use hardware acceleration when available\") should fix the issue.\n", "Q: DeployStudio Kernel Panic We have setup a DeployStudio server on a Mountain Lion server and also a NetBoot set on the server for deploying an image for a lab of about 70 workstations. We are in the process of upgrading them all to Mavericks. \nAfter we run the workflow that installs the image we get a kernel panic screen and then the station allows us to move the cursor and continue the startup process (It is the traditional kernel panic screen but allows us to continue). No problems have occurred while using the station. The only issue that we have come across that may be related was when creating the NetBoot set through DeployStudio Assistant it gave us a Recovery Partition version mismatch error but allowed us to create the set anyways. We do not know if this is related to the kernel panic that occurs but it's the only thing out of the ordinary that is happening.\nIs the recovery partition issue related or is it something else? If there's is more information needed I am happy to provide it. Thanks in advance!\nEDIT: Here's the backtrace information from the .panic file.

have only one panic, don't worry. As they pile up, you can follow the general advice on troubleshooting kernel panics: What is a Kernel Panic and what does it mean?\nOnce you have 5 to 20 reports, it's often far easier to know what piece of information in the long reports is relevant or repeats.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S and 5 freezes after not answering 2 calls I'm having some issues after receiving 2 calls from anyone. So this is how it happened:\n(NOTE: This errors happens when my iphone is locked and the screen is turned off)\nSometimes people call me when I'm busy at work and I can't answer them. After receiving 2 or more calls from anyone, the iPhone freezes when it displays the message: \"Do you to send a text message?\" \nAt the first time I can press the \"Cancel\" option. However, after receiving the second call it displays the same message but it freezes immediately. I can't do anything unless I make a call using Siri. When Siri calls, the iPhone \"unfreezes\" itself. I tried making 2 calls to an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 5C and the same error occurs.\nIt seems this is an OS error. Have anyone noticed this? Does someone know how to fix this error? \nThanks!\n\nA: After spending quite sometime trying to find out a definite solution to this annoying problem I am afraid this is a glitch we have to live with until apple comes up with a fix. In my case not even using Siri for a call helped out. Once the call is over the phone freezes again. The only walk around I have found is asking Siri to open any application I have in the phone (I usually ask for the calendar) and Siri will notice that the phone is locked and will ask for the four digit code to unlocked. Just plug the code in and magic, you will gain access to the phone without having to reset. \n", "Q: Find My iPhone shows device as 'Offline' My mom tried to track my iPhone 5 using Find My iPhone. My location services were turned on and everything was working properly. Then it said between a certain time that my iPhone was 'offline'. She thinks I manually went and turned it off, making me appear to be offline but I did not do this. It is the second time this has happened since I got the app last year. I need to know why this is happening so that I can explain to her I am not doing it.\n\nA: Wow, Big Brother is watching! Contrary to popular belief, the iPhone's cell reception is not perfect, and from time to time you can and will \"lose cell,\" and it will appear offline. This can happen when it enters its energy saving mode when asleep, though you should still receive calls. This can really happen any time you're not within a reasonable line of site to a cell tower, or even when switching between towers, and cell frequencies really don't go through wooded areas or mountains or hills all that well, and by that I mean \"not at all.\" It is completely normal for iPhones and cell phones in general to lose cell connectivity when behind a hill from the nearest cell tower. Also, holding the phone wrong can cause it to lose cell, because just holding it will de-attenuate the antenna. And all cell phones have this feature.\nAlso, the A-GPS system iPhone uses is also not perfect. GPS itself is far from perfect, and really doesn't work all that well (read \"not at all\") unless you have a line of sight to 3 or more satellites. The 'A' part of A-GPS means \"assisted\" and you can read about what that means in the link above, and it mitigates some of the issues with GPS.\nUsing \"Find My iPhone\" to track family members is a little extreme. I think a more friendly way to have the same functionality is to use Apple's Find My Friends app. Try to talk Mom into using that instead, and then you can track her at the same time, too, quid pro quo.\n\nA: My daughter had this issue as well. She lives alone and relies on me to know where she is if she goes missing. She didn't turn off the setting, but it somehow got turned off. Here is how to turn it back on:\nSettings → Privacy → Location Services → scroll all the way to the bottom to Find My iPhone and flip switch on.\n\nA: You must also go to:\nSettings → iCloud → scroll down to Find My iPhone and make sure it is turned ON.\n", "Q: Sign in to ** to update application for that account So I somehow grabbed my parents USB thumb drive to install Mountain Lion.

This issue was addressed with improved permission handling.\n\nThis vulnerability was assigned the security identifier CVE-2014-1347.\n\nA: This is a problem where iCloud's Find My Mac interacts poorly with an iTunes update. (Specifically iTunes 11.2)\nThe fix and cause are documented expertly on Rich Trouton's blog:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/users-folder-being-hidden-with-itunes-11-2-installed-and-find-my-mac-enabled/\nThe fix is to disable find my Mac and then run a script to repair the permissions and visibility of the potentially affected folders.

Cisco Meraki is fantastic, it blows the features of Apple's Profile Manager out of the water. One thing I would very much like to be able to do however is to push Volume Purchased Mac Apps to all our devices via Meraki, or something similar. \nIs this possible? We have iOS VPP set up perfectly to the point where apps can be one click installed - can this be done with OS X?\n\nA: Yes you can. The process is the same as pushing VPP apps to an iOS device. You can look at this KB article from Meraki to see how it would work.\n", "Q: With FileVault on, is secure trash emptying needed? I'm running Mavericks and have FileVault set for the whole disk. Is there any value then, in emptying the Trash securely? Given the whole disk is encrypted. \nI'm not certain on how these two methods interact/ overlap.\nThanks.\n\nA: Secure Empty Trash and FileVault are two different methods for protecting data. FileVault encrypts everything on the hard drive. Only someone with an admin password can decrypt them. This includes anything in your Trash. So by default, the files you delete when FileVault is on are safe via encryption. Even if someone recovered them, they'd still need your password to decrypt.\nSecure Empty Trash has nothing to do with encryption. The default Empty Trash just deletes pointers to old files and marks the space they were using on the hard drive as free to use in the future. However, the files are still there if someone ran a data recovery tool or until the OS decides to put a new file over them. Secure Empty Trash prevents recovering deleted files by writing data (zeros) over the space the files you're deleting were using. Meaning the files are completely destroyed.\nHere's how it breaks down:\nFileVault On | Empty Trash (non-secure) | Someone can still recover those files, but they will recover files that are encrypted per FileVault\nFileVault On | Secure Empty Trash | No one can recover the files, so it doesn't matter whether they were encrypted or not to begin with.\nDo you need to use Secure Empty Trash with FileVault on? I think it's overkill unless you're afraid that someone will recover files and have your password ready for decryption.\n", "Q: OS 10.9.3 Seagate External Drive Won't Mount Updated to Mavericks and now my external 1TB Seagate drive won't mount. Its icon (\"Blorp\") is greyed out in Disk Utility and all it says about the volume is that it is a \"locked logical volume.\" This is not being used as a Time Machine backup drive, just an external drive. It won't even prompt for a password when I try to mount it. And it shouldn't be locked, since I turned off the encryption prior to upgrading the OS. This started when I opened up the computer and it said the drive was not ejected properly, even though it had been plugged in continuously. Can I get this drive back without reformatting it?\n\nThere is no fsck_hfs or similar process shown in Activity Monitor. I have run disk repair multiple times, and it always comes up ok:\n\n\nA: I don't know exactly what build changed the mount behavior of OS X, but there are times when you will connect the disk and the OS will no longer mount it until the system has finished the file system check (fsck). There is no visual notification that an extended check is being made, so you have to rely on Disk Utility or the Activity Monitor and actively look to see if a check is in progress.\nConnect your missing drive again and then, open activity monitor and select the CPU tab if needed. Then search for fsck - if you see a process with that name (or similar fsck_hfs, etc...) then the system has decided to check the contents before it knows to let you have read-only access to the drive or read-write access.\nIf that's not the case, then you may have some odd corruption that requires a repair of the drive structure (in your case select the main \"Blorp\" and not the indented \"Blorp\" in the left pane of the Disk Utility window. The dimming of the repair button is indicative of a process already running to check/repair that volume.\nMost cases, this is a check that could take some time, but often is done within 5 minutes or less and not something that happens every mount but after another problem was detected or logged to that drive such as an unclean ejection or force eject.\n", "Q: Constant kernel GPU panics (GPUPanic.cpp:127) on mid-2010 MacBook Pro (6,2) Hardware is a mid 2010 MAcBook Pro 15\", i7 2,66ghz, 8 GB RAM, 512 MB Video RAM.\nI encounter regular kernel panics for a while now, I think since upgrading to Mavericks. Usually it used to happen every now and then, between once a week and once a month. So I did not really worry in the beginning. As it started getting on my nerves and neither volume repair nor hard ware test did indicate anything wrong, I decided to do a clean install of the latest Mavericks version a few days ago to see if that helps. kernel panics are still there and with the update to 10.9.3. today it seems even worse.

Might the video card or kernel extension be the problem? Any help would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Repeated kernel panics occurring without third party drivers can only be caused by a few things:\n1) A peripheral device\n2) A bad OSX image or bug in OSX itself\n3) A hardware problem\nIn your case, it is unfortunately (3):\n\nSystem model name: MacBookPro6,2 \n\nThe kernel panic indicates that your GPU is failing. This is a known issue for your machine. Your model is subject to a replacement program for the logicboard due to a defective GPU. It lasts 3 years from the date of purchase. If this is already expired, Apple may or may not still replace your logicboard. It is ultimately at the discretion of the store manager. If you don't qualify, your other option would be a flat rate repair, for ~$300, which Apple will repair anything wrong with the machine for this fee. Best of luck. \n\nA: Yes the GPU panics are almost certainly due to a defective discrete GPU card. I have the same 2010 MBP and have noticed 10.9.3 has increased the frequency of these fatal crashes significantly.\nI'm using the gfxCardStatus utility to turn off this discrete card whenever possible but many apps force it on.\n\nA: After a few arguments with a local Apple Store I contacted national Apple management and argued that the problems only started after upgrading to Maverick, which happened three years after purchase. Since they never mentioned Maverick would cause problems on a 2010 MacBook Pro the replacement program should still be applied. They finally agreed.\n\nA: Apple has issued a recall for Macbook Pros Mid 2012. Others may be in the recall. I took it to a store and they had to replace the Logic board ($1000). Thankfully I did not have to pay a cent due to the recall. If you have \"GPU Panic\" based screen blanks, take it to Mac Shop/Repair shop and they will take care of it.  They will run a diagnostic and in 20 mins you will know if it is eligible.\nThis is not a software issue. Apple would have taken care of it that way. Reinstalling the OS is not an option. \nThis is a hardware issue. Logic board needs to be removed. Go to a mac store.\nRead about the recall here: http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/widespread-2011-macbook-pro-failures-petition-lawsuit-repair-programme-3497935/\n\nA: Seems like using the Kext Utility to clear and repair my kext permissions and doing a clean boot fixed this issue for me. Only tested for a few hours now but so far so good. Many people get a logic board replacement but I think it may have been a kext issue as every time I upgrade I run into kernel panics at some point. I push my machines to the limit and run into panics every 10 or so minutes when running on \"Discrete GPU\" only. \nNow I can enable automatic switching without any problems. Hope this helps someone.\nhttp://www.hackintoshosx.com/files/download/4286-kext-utility/\n\nA: Im surprised that nobody on any forums has even touched on this answer i'm about to give and i HAD the exact same issues with mine that most ppl have been having.. So heres what ive found is the root of mine and a few ppls computers ive fixed due to gpu panics.. If you have corrupt or unsupported .jpeg, .mpeg, .mp4, PDF, or any related formats on your hd, it will cause GPU panics to happen.. So the best way to figure it out before thinking that your GPU is fried is get Tech Tool Pro or a similar app and do a file optimization test. On TTP it will tell u which ones and exactly where they r located.. I made the mistake of \"upgrading\" from Mavericks to Yosemite, and it messed everything up.. I ended up with over 1000 unsupported or corrupt files in those formats because of the \"upgrade\". It took a couple of painstaking hours to remove the files manually, but the panics have virtually stopped.. And my panics where absolutely infuriating.. I would turn my computer on and if i ran more than 1 or 2 apps at once, it would double panic, then 10 minutes later, it would do it again out of nowhere.. So a simple thing like taking all of those corrupt files fixed it.. Im amazed that all those \"support techs\" or \"gurus\" that work for mac havent shed any light on this, because its kinda common sense that would be one of the first things they should be thinking of when troubleshooting this VERY common issue! Hope this helps! If it did, please leave a like or comment, so i can keep personal track myself of how many headaches this might help be avoiding! ;) \n\nUse Tech Tool Pro or related software that has a file optimization feature and remove all corrupt or unsupported files that I listed above.\n", "Q: how to open fiddler saz files on mac or online? a friend sent me a fiddler record for me to watch.\nI have mac and the file he has sent is X.saz \nI could install fiddler on mac. How can i open these files to watch?\n\nA: TextWrangler is a free piece of text editing software that is capable of opening these files. \nhttp://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/\nYou can also unpack them by changing the extension to .zip and unzipping normally. \nhttp://fiddler.wikidot.com/saz-files\n", "Q: Where does OS X store my Adobe product keys? I know that Keychain holds my WiFi and other passwords, but I'm curious to know where my Adobe and Microsoft product keys for things like CS6 and Office live. I'm using OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: There's no generic OS X place for storing product keys. It is up to each individual software supplier to decide where they want to store the products.

The process of indexing was greatly slowed down by OSX attempting to index a very slow, old external drive we had hooked up.\nOnce the indexing had finished (it actually took quite a while) the laptop eventually returned to its former speed. \nThere's also a post by Computer World that backs up this conclusion:\n\nOS X will rebuild the Spotlight index after a major System upgrade. The process takes time and degrades performance while it takes place.\nClick on the Spotlight (looking glass) icon to the top right of the display to see if indexing is taking place. If indexing is in progress you should see a dot in the middle of the looking glass icon and/or be told the operation is taking place. Allow the process to complete and you should see immediate performance improvement.\n\n", "Q: Is there any default tool in OSX by which to add text (such as subtitle) to a video?

I have a 2TB time capsule.  I am driving from PA to FL with 3 kids.  I have a hundred of so movies/TV shows stored on a 2TB Time Capsule.  Can I use a power converter in my minivan to power and use the TC for the kids to each watch whatever they want on our road trip via wifi (they all have iPads)? It seems like it would work, but I'm not sure what the possible \"issues\" might be.\nThx\n\nA: Theoretically, it should work. the Time capsule will just go into infrastructure mode, creating a self-made IP, and provide IP addresses to the iPads. So you will get your own little wifi bubble in the car, connected to nothing. But, the iPads will be connected to the time capsule. \nHowever, you need more than that: iPads don't have a file browser to be able to find the movies on the time capsule hard drive. They really need iTunes running to serve up those movies.\nSo, now you need a laptop, plus the time capsule. (or now just wifi router, since you don't need the hard drive in a time capsule, you have a laptop)\nYou could do this with a DLNA server app, and a DLNA viewer app on the iPads as well, if you don't want iTunes, but you still need something to serve as the DLNA server. You could use a wifi router combined with say a WD My Cloud hard drive, or similar for example. This would eliminate the laptop, but you still need another device.\n", "Q: Two Applications folders, one empty I just noticed on my Mavericks' Finder today that there are two different Applications folders. One located under Main HD:\n\nAnd the other one at Main HD -> Users -> Amit:\n\nWhat's the difference between the two and why is one full while the other empty? Also, I did notice that my Main HD no longer shows the Users folder even though it's there. The Users folder wasn't always invisible. While it's no big deal, I am really curious as to why it would suddenly go undercover without me doing anything to it!\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*The Application folder inside your home folder is for apps which are restricted to your user. So some applications choose to \"install\"\n  or copy their application in this folder. It's based on the decision\n  of the app creator. But most of the apps are installed in the\n  /Applications folder.\n  \n*Apple decided to hide the /Users folder. That's it.\n  \n\nWith this command:\nsudo chflags nohidden /Users\n\nunhides it.\n\nA: As to what made Apple (rather than \"Mac,\" Apple is the company, Mac the product) make the /Users folder invisible?\nProbably the same reason they made the ~/Library folder invisible. they (likely) thought that you don't need access to it, only your own home folder.\nAnd for \"power users\" who want or need access, it is easy enough to fix as shown above.\nSome people upgraded to the new Mavericks 10.9.3 and their /Users folder was not hidden. So there may be a bug somewhere. Whether it is hiding the /Users folder or not hiding it remains to be seen in any following updates.\n\nA: Ok, the mystery of the missing Users folder is finally solved. Like I had said in my question, it wasn't always hidden and went undercover only recently of its own accord. Steve Chamber's answer that this has something to do with upgrade to 10.9.3 is also only partially correct. Since none of the respondents have given an accurate explanation and I just discovered the answer elsewhere, I am posting my findings for others to benefit.\nThe folder has gone into hiding only for those who have upgraded to iTunes 11.2 and have their \"Find My Mac\" turned on. Not sure why but this is the only user group that has been affected, me being one of them. Also, the solution provided by 2DD8847 is not permanent as changing the flag to no hidden from the command line will only bring back the folder for the prevailing session. Reboot your Mac and it will be gone again!\nA more permanent solution involves using AppleScript and is given here.\n\nA: I had the same issue, the only explanation i can guess that , the reason it went hidden as an impact from a Spyware script that was installed with an infected dmg file of one of the software downloaded recently from cNet\n", "Q: say command says wrong text (for some voices) I'm running 10.8.5 and installed some of the newer text-to-speech voices, including \"Samantha\" (aka Siri), \"Tom\", and \"Jill\".

If you try their Vocalizer Demo you can hear that \"seq\" is replaced by \"the following\" there as well.\nThis appears to be similar to Nuance's recognition of \"homographic abbreviations\", where Nuance will attempt to convert an abbreviation into the full word.\nI have noticed that there are other words that are interpreted\n\n\n*\n\n*e.g. \"for example\"\n\n*sat. \"Saturday\"\n\n*mar. \"March\"\n\n\nA: Obviously, what’s spoken is not what you expected to be spoken. I’m not sure I would call it “wrong”, though. “seq” is a fairly obscure dictionary entry in the first place, and “the following” is one possible expansion of this abbreviation (although I think “and the following” would be better), e.g. in literature references:\nKnuth, Art of Computer Programming Vol 1, pp 329 seq.\n", "Q: How to keep exchange emails from showing up in contacts?

While this is happening, the battery can actually discharge even though it is plugged in. This has happened since I first got the MacBook and is not something which has developed over time.\nI have the model without a dedicated GPU (Intel Iris Pro only), and I have an 85 watt power supply which came with the MacBook\nThis is very irritating for me, is this a fault or normal behaviour?\n\nA: It is a known problem: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3069428\nSomeone has calculated the max wattage draw of a MBPr, but I can't find that a.t.m.\n\nA: I see this as a design choice - works as designed and functioning as built situation. All engineering and hardware design is an exercise in tradeoffs and many of the goals compete against each other:\n\n\n*\n\n*reliability of the parts as they age\n\n*ability of manufacturing to make the device reliably and repeatably\n\n*cost of parts\n\n*cost of manufacture\n\n*speed to diagnose and repair\n\n*durability of repair (nothing makes us mad like looping repairs when the issue isn't fixed or more issues are caused by a repair for something else)\n\n\nI haven't even got into the more relevant design decisions like which CPU chip to put it and whether the higher CPU model gets the same power supply and battery as the lowest performing CPU model. Or whether the CPU you chose can out run the power supply since the battery can and has always for the last 10 years been able to supply far more current on demand than the charge rate of the battery from the AC power supply transformer. The only intel based Mac product that can't outspend their power supply are ones that plug into mains. No portable Mac can keep up with a fully running CPU/GPU when cooling is good enough to keep thermal throttling from kicking in.\nI'm not at all saying you are wrong to be irritated, just that this was a conscious decision made by teams of people knowing some times their design won't keep up and then management trusting / approving those design decisions and shipping years of product with that decision. When viewed from the lens of CPU shouldn't outpace the power supply, this is a compromise. When viewed from other lenses (lightness, parts management, reliability, supply chain management), this is an excellent/beneficial decision (or still compromise). I hope this helps you know you're not wrong and that this would be something you consider when you choose how your processing load gets run. Whether you can offload some tasks to the cloud or if you need to be tied to mains power since you can't accept this sort of tradeoff for your needs.\n", "Q: Keyboard Maestro interfering with control-tab action in browsers - how to disable?

The upgrade seemed to go without a hitch until the machine restarted, after which I get the Apple logo with a progress bar---it takes about 20 minutes for the progress bar to advance all the way and then the machine spontaneously powers off. When powered back on the process repeats itself.\nSo far I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into recovery using command+r. This works and I'm able to launch the Disk Utility. This shows S.M.A.R.T Status : Verified. Running Verify Disk on the HDD (topmost level of the tree) shows no errors. However, running verify on the Macintosh HD partition does show errors and asks me to run Repair Disk, which tells me I have irreparable errors and suggests that I back up my data and reformat.\n\n*Reformat. Still in recovery mode Disk Utility, I first tried running Erase under the Erase tab on\n\n\n*\n\n*the HDD, resulting in: Disk Erase failed with the error: Couldn't unmount disk. (in retrospect this makes sense because initially I was booting to the recovery partition on the same disk)\n\n*the Macintosh HD partition, resulting in: Couldn't open disk.\nNext I tried selecting the HDD and the Partition tab. I attempt to remove the Macintosh HD partition by clicking on the minus, but the system hangs on Preparing to remove partition.\n\n*Try USB recovery disk. After all of this failed I started to suspect that Disk Utility was refusing to make changes to the HDD since I was booting to the recovery partition on the same disk. I then made a bootable USB recovery disk using the Recovery Disk Assistant and am able to boot to it by holding the option key on startup. However I am still unable to erase the disk using the methods above and get the same error messages.\n\n*Try to force unmount HDD. It appears to me that the system is still mounting the HDD even when booting from the USB recovery, thus preventing reformatting. But attempting to force an unmount fails:\ndiskutil unmountDisk force disk1\n\nresults in\nForced unmount of disk1 failed: at least one volume could not be unmounted\n\nI'm at a loss for what to try next. It seems unlikely to me that the disk is failing since the SMART status is OK, but I suppose that is a possibility too.\nEDIT\nFollowing @chillin's suggestion I tried booting to a Mavericks USB install disk, created following the instructions here. Holding option on startup I'm able to select the USB and boot appears normal, but with the same result that I am unable to unmount the internal disk to format, even using diskutil unmountDisk force disk1 (I get the same error messages for all methods described above). I do notice that the option to reinstall OS X has been replaced by an option to install, so I am confident that I'm actually booting to USB.\nEDIT 2\nFollowing @Édouard's comment I tried booting in verbose mode using command+v at startup. It seems that fsck_hfs is caught in a loop \"repairing\" and rechecking the drive, which it does 3-4 times before the machine gives up and powers down (see picture 1). The line /dev/rdisk1s2 (NO WRITE) catches my attention. Could this be why fsck is unable to make the necessary changes to repair the drive?\n\n\nA: I’m afraid your hard drive is dying. Updating can be somehow hard drive intensive, so it’s not that surprising that it died during an update. If you have no backup, copy your important data to another hard drive with another computer1.\nYou can still try to save it with utilities such as DiskWarrior.\nOtherwise, you’ll have to buy a new hard drive and install it in your Mac Pro, then copy your data back to it.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*And start doing regular back up right now.\n\n", "Q: Increase space between two directories from “ls” I recently switched to Mac from Ubuntu and I've still had a quite a lot to figure out.\nFor iTerm2, how to adjust the space between files/directories?

And when I used this template, it never asked me for any details and immediately asked me where to save the project.. I selected Desktop and it saved the xcodeproj file on the desktop as Desktop.xcodeproj and deleted everything else on my Desktop. Sad to say ALL of my developing documents were on my desktop and it just disappeared. Not in trash can, not in .Trashes, not in Users/user/Trash, not anywhere on data recovery apps. \nThis is the template PLIST I used\n\nA: I would say, since a .xcodeproj is nothing else than a folder, that it may have replaced the original \"Desktop\" folder. Strange though, due to the different file extension...\nAs a second suggestion, have you tried ls -l Desktop.xcodeproj/ ? This would give you the contents of the .xcodeproj folder. Alternatively, you could right click on it and select \"show package contents\". Maybe your original Desktop was just renamed and given an extension...\n\nA: If you replace a folder full of files with an empty folder, the chances are 100% of the files are recoverable if you write no more data to the drive and get professional help recovering the files.\nIn practice, the OS writes files constantly, so there's always a chance it could extend an existing file and overwrite what was allocated space and is now seen as free space by the OS.\nYour best bet if you truly have no backup is to stop using the computer immediately and get an estimate on the cost of recovery rather than learning how to do data recovery on your own data.\nSee the options in this answer for several good recovery programs and vendors (Drive Savers and Kroll Ontrack):\n\n\n*\n\n*OSX partitions wiped by NAS RAID\nIf you want to do a DIY recovery, I would buy an external drive and mirror the contents of your existing drive (not running that OS again) and attempt the recovery on a copy of the data.

Have you tried a search via the terminal? I'd cd into Desktop/, then \nls -l .*\n\nSee if that turns up anything that might be hidden, including a hidden .Trash folder. \n\nA: You did appearently not select Desktop as the folder, you gave the name Desktop to the project and created it in your home directory. What xCode does is, it creates a new folder which is called like your project, where your project is inside. \nThe directory you actually chose to make the project inside is your home directory, ~/. So xCode created a \"Desktop\" folder, that replaced the existing \"Desktop\" folder. No backup?

I am looking for a \"tabs decluttering\" app for Safari like OneTab Chrome Extension\n\nHow OneTab Works\nWhenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon\nto convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the\ntabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save up to 95% of\nmemory because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in Google\nChrome.\n\n\nA: Here is a native way of doing it without the use of any extensions.\nIn Safari, under the \"Bookmarks\" menu, there is an option for you to \"Add Bookmarks for These X Tabs...\". If you click on it, you will be prompted to save these tabs in the current windows as bookmarks. You can assign them to a Folder and give it a Session Name.\n\nWhen you do want to resume the session, you simply go to the bookmark folder, right click on it and select \"Open in New Tabs\".\n\nThe beauty of this methods is that, if you have iCloud sync enabled, you will be able to resume your saved sessions across all your Apple devices.\n\nA: There is one now called TabLister, that's very similar to OneTab.\nhttp://tablister.com\nAlso available from the Safari Extensions Gallery.\n\nA: The closest extension that can save the open tabs into a list is Sessions.\nYou can also restore all the tabs all at once, or by double-clicking them to restore individual tabs.\nGenerally, after you save the tabs into list, you can close the rest of the tabs with Option+Command+W. Closing these tabs will free the memory that the tabs has taken. Meanwhile, your saved list of of tabs are stored in a document that won’t need memory to stay in use. The only time you’ll see the memory usage is when the Session extension is called (which get loaded with the list of the sessions you’ve saved).\nHere is the comparison of the memory usage before and after all tabs are closed.\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\n\nA: Like I stated under another question, I have had the same question and found no answer. The old extensions mentioned by other answers work no more with the new APIs (Safari 12). So I myself developed a Safari extension named Tab Space which could handle this task for me. To some extent, it provides even more functions, such as adding tags for these saved sessions.\nTry it if you'd like to do so.\n\nA: OneTab for Safari is available via the AppStore https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/onetab/id1540160809\n\nA: Toast (free), available for Safari and Chrome does this.\nhttps://dotoast.com\nYou have to reopen the whole session rather than cherry pick tabs to reopen.\n\nA: In Safari, you have to use the menu View or the Shift+Cmd+\\  keys.\n", "Q: Does Photo Stream update later if computer is offline? I shoot with a DSLR on the road and import the photos on my laptop MBP to edit them.  Sometimes, the laptop is not in a wifi zone when I import the photos (physically from SD card), and they do not get to My Photo Stream, even after I take the MBP to a wifi zone later.  \nIs it because the photos are only considered \"new\" if the MBP is connected to a wifi zone WHILE the photos are imported?  The Photo Stream description in Aperture prefs seems to indicate that \"Send all new photos to My Photo Stream.\"\nSecond question:  If I import 400 photos from a shoot and the MBP goes to sleep after a few minutes of keyboard inactivity, does the photo stream continue to update, or is the uploading activity put on hold until I wake up the computer again.  Related: Does iPhoto or Aperture have to be running for My Photo Stream to continue uploading imported photos?\n\nA: 1) In my experience, I've found that simply quitting either Aperture or iPhoto and re-opening is the easiest solution to a stall in the syncing process. I've experienced similar issues before. As to to the \"why?\" - that being \"why does Photostream stall when switching networks,\" I can't provide an answer. But the failsafe solution is to quit and re-open the application.\n2) Again (in my experience - Apple's documentation on this is sparse), I've found that photo stream only actively syncs when the machine is 1) awake or 2) sleeping, but not 'hibernating.' Unlike iOS devices, it seems as though Photostream is more stubborn in regards to OSX devices regarding the active and continuous syncing of data. \n3) Yes. Either iPhoto or Aperture need to be open. \n", "Q: Samsung EVO 480 *and* stock hard drive not recognised by Snow Leopard installer A friend of mine came to me with her Macbook Pro 8,3 (17 inch, 2011). The hard drive had failed, and booting into the recovery disk didn't show a working hard drive.\nI went out and bought her a samsung EVO 480 (because why not do an upgrade while I'm at it?), and plugged it in.\nStill not recognised by Disk Utility on the install disk.\nI went back and reformatted the disk as HFS+ with my windows machine, using MacDrive. Put it back in the laptop, and it's still not turning up in the list.\nI have confirmed that the SSD has the latest firmware on it using Samsung's magician software, and I'm now focusing on the SATA cable.\nThough I'm not sure what my options are for diagnosis and replacement of parts now, as I haven't ever had to deal with a broken cable! Any ideas, anyone?\n\nA: The answer in this particular instance was that the SATA cable had come loose. Unscrewing the metal grate housing and re-pressing the connector to the mobo fixed it, and the HFS+ formatted Samsung 840 EVO SSD worked in the macbook pro.\nThe original hard drive still works, but will now be put in the optical bay instead of the superdrive.\n\nA: Its not a broken cable. If you look carefully at the packaging and features for that drive, you will notice that Samsung tells you it is only supported on Windows. They prepared the drive for Windows, and MacDrive did not fix the partition table that Samsung set up.\nBut don't worry... all you need is one of these. You might be able to find one at your local OfficeMax for twice as much. Any external enclosure or dock will do I believe.\nPull the SSD, connect using a cable like that, or put in an external enclosure, boot the mac from your Snow Leopard installer, under Utlitiles menu choose Disk Utility, and you will be able to see it, and correctly partition it replacing the MBR with GUID, quit Disk Utility, and you can then complete your System installation.\nAfter the installation is complete and you have rebooted and walked through the Setup Assistant and logged in, shutdown, and only then install the drive internally.\n\nSnow Leopard includes TRIM support for Apple installed SSD's in Snow Leopard 10.6.8, but no one else's SSD's. After you get the System installed, and the SSD installed, update the OS (I recommend you download the 10.6.8 Combo Update rather than using software update — its much faster to download and install the combo than the individual updates), you're going to want to enable TRIM. There are instructions on how to do it manually, but using TRIM Enabler has the exact same effect. There is some more tuning you can do to optimize Snow Leopard for SSD.\n\nAlso, do your friend a solid (since you screwed up a little ;). Create for her a Snow Leopard installer for recovery if neccesary, except don't use a crummy unreliable elcheepo USB thumb, use an indestructable SD card. The linked instructions are for a USB thumb, but the instructions for doing this with an SD Card are identical, except that you'll be using an SD Card instead of a USB Thumb. Then purchase this kit for her, and once you indeed have a recovery/installer SD Card made, remove the optical drive and install it in this, and get her a 750GB Momentus (*I wouldn't recommend the 1TB notebook drives... and newegg is out of stock of these 750GB drives, which is a strong indicator that something is up! And wow that's a nice price!). And since you volunteered and you've really jammed her up with this not getting the right SSD thing... may as well max out her RAM. You're really going to feel good about yourself, I can promise you that.\n", "Q: OS X 10.9.3 Update causing coreservicesd lag I'm getting a lot of stalling and high CPU usage when I open folders in Finder for the first time after the 10.9.3 update.

Neither device has recognised the other.\nHave I missed something out?\n\nA: This problem could also be caused by a missing or improper HDCP signal coming from the MiniDisplayport-to-HDMI adapter. \nI experienced the same issue with my MacbookPro (late 2008) and a Bravia TV. I tried one cable with a MiniDisplayport connector on one end and HDMI plug at the other. This worked fine between my MBP and a computer monitor or a beamer, but would not transmit any signal to a Sony Bravia TV. An adapter (of the cheaper kind) displayed the same behavior. The used HDMI cable was fine (tested between PS3 and the TV). Again, adapter and cable produced a proper signal on non-Bravia displays.

Buy the original Apple Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter and try again. :)\n\nA: I have solved this problem with the help of telephone support. Initially I was disheartened after reading all that has been written in this particular article comments section, but luckily I managed to crack this. \nI had earlier used a samsung with the mac mini, and straight out of the box, it matched with the samsung. It appears that this leaves the mac mini with the memory of the samsung. Hence when connecting with HDMI to a Sony Bravia, the mac mini did not recognise the Sony and vice versa.\nI switched off the mac mini, disconnected the HDMI, connected it back, switched on the mac mini, AND HELD DOWN THE OPTION BUTTON THROUGHOUT, then pressed CMD+F1. That did the trick partially. Then i restarted the mac mini, as before. Everything now sings.\nI also have a USB out to my DAC for music, which is the principal purpose of the mac mini. That has stayed undisturbed. But in the quicktime / ELMedia player etc. to play the movies in different formats, it is necessary to switch the output from built in speakers to an amplifier (painfully, every time) and then the sound comes from the amp-speaker combo and the picture from the TV.\nThe less elegant way to do all this is to have a Apple TV connected by ethernet or wifi to your router, and a mac mini to the same router, and then the Sony TV will accept anything your mac mini has, provided it is iTunes compatible.\nIf the apple TV is jailbriken, then you can use some other formats and a whole lot of other programs. There is plenty of literature around the how and why of apple Tv jailbreaking.\nHope this helps everyone.\n\nA: It is a known fact that Mac to Samsung monitors or TVs do not work.  I spent $500 on dual Samsung monitors and it didn't work correctly.  \n", "Q: No 'Software Update' option in iPad from iOS 4 I'm helping my Dad over the phone to upgrade his iPad.

The only problem is that it's very unclear to me what happens if I remove the Photo Stream: are the photos deleted from other devices?  (I'm not talking about deleting individual photos from the photo stream, but rather turning off Photo Stream on that device.  Apple doesn't make the consequences of that action 100% clear, and things I've read (which I hope are wrong) suggest that any removal on one device is carried over to other devices.\n\nA: \nWhat happens to my photos if I turn off My Photo Stream?\nIf you sign out of iCloud or turn off My Photo Stream on an iOS device, all the images in My Photo Stream are removed from that device. The images in My Photo Stream on your other devices are not affected. Images added to My Photo Stream are saved on the iCloud server for 30 days from the date you added them to My Photo Stream. If you sign in to iCloud with the same Apple ID and turn on My Photo Stream on another device, those photos will automatically download to this device.

On the apple forums there were all kinds of advices, from redownloading the drivers to using specific USB ports, but what I eventually found to be helping me was this tip which I think mounts the drive in \"legacy mode\" or something like that:\nhttp://twocanoes.com/winclone/support#faq123\nNow I can control mouse and keyboard, but soon after the installer tells me that \"No device drivers were found. Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers and then click OK\".\nI am using a USB hd which I have formattet to be an install disk with drivers and everything from the bootcamp installer. Additionally I tried downloading these drivers:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1721\n...and putting them on a USB pen-driver, but nevertheless, the windows installer can't see them and I can't get past this step. When I try to browse for the drivers I see two drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*BOOTCAMP (C:)\n\n*BOOT (X:)\n\n*\n\n*Program Files\n\n*sources\n\n*Users\n\n*Windows\n\n\n\n(C:) is my bootcamp partition and I am assuming that (X:) is my install drive, but the file structure looks nothing like what it looks like from Mac OS X??

Do not check the other two options (\"Create a Windows ... install disk\" and \"Download support software from Apple\") or Bootcamp will reformat the USB!! You have already prepared the USB on the PC.\n\n*Press continue, determine the size of the Windows partition you want and press continue. Extra tip: I never divide by half, because during Windows installation I'm never sure which is the partition I need to use; they both appear to have same size and if I get to pick the wrong one I could lose my Mac OS partition.

The premise is this:\nI have an app which has been set in its code to only run on OS X versions 10.4 to 10.9.2. (When I try to install it, it gives a message \"This version of ____ is for Mac OS X 10.4 to 10.9.2.\"). I have updated to 10.9.3, and the developer just needs to update the app to fix this restriction in his tool.\nI'm actually in contact with the developer, who says he is 'too busy' to work on the app or issue an update right now.\nI worked out that the app is just reading /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist to determine OS version, and I managed to bypass its installer restriction by temporarily editing the file using this guide. But after reverting the plist values to 10.9.3 and restarting the system to start (hopefully) using the app, I saw that it even checks SystemVersion.plist to even run as well - not just during installation.\nI'm worried that if I keep SystemVersion.plist at 10.9.2 indefinitely it would ruin other parts of the system such as App Store updates and the like.\nSo my idea now, is to try and find some method or tool, to block the app from being able to even read SystemVersion.plist entirely - think of it as a 'file system' version of Little Snitch if you will - just some way to create custom rules, for specific processes, that disallow read and/or write access, to specific files/folders in the system.\nMaybe it would just cause the app to throw an error and not run at all (I could probably test this by temporarily moving the plist file to Trash for just 30 seconds while trying to install/run it) - but in either case, I think it's a really useful thing to be able to have, for powerful security purposes - just like the custom-blocking network access for apps in Little Snitch.\nSo is there some awesome third party tool, or even native OS X / Xcode tool, that can do this? Any insights as to what would even need to happen anyway, system/programming-wise? Tweaking with 'Sharing & Persimmons' for a file in Finder lets me control user access, but not process.\n\nA: You could just use the built-in sandboxing features of Mac OS X.\nCreate a custom profile that limits access to the SystemVersion.plist file, using syntax like this:\n(version 1)\n(deny file* (literal \"/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist\"))\n(allow default)\n\nSave that as for example ~/myprofile.sb and then run your program like this:\nsandbox-exec -f ~/myprofile.sb \"/Application/My Program.app/Contents/MacOS/My Program\"\n\n\nA: Hands Off app has this feature:\n\nMonitoring disk access\nApplications present on your computer can freely read, store or erase information on your computer without your knowledge. Using Hands Off!, you can monitor and control disk access from all applications as to prevent them from obtaining confidential information, erasing your data or storing cookies.\n\nAnd it happens to include the network firewall feature of Little Snitch.\nhttps://www.macworld.com/article/3190149/little-flocker-reincarnates-at-f-secure-in-free-beta.html:\n\nLittle Flocker, a tool that restricts apps and system processes access to files without permission. He was unable to talk details, but recently F-Secure, a leading security developer and analysis company, announced its purchase of Little Flocker, which it’s rebranded as Xfence.\n\nMacOS Catalina now has this similar feature:\n\nData protections\nmacOS Catalina checks with you before allowing an app to access your data in your Documents, Desktop, and Downloads folders; iCloud Drive; the folders of third-party cloud storage providers; removable media; and external volumes. In addition, you’re asked before an app can perform key logging or capture a still or video recording of your screen.\n\n", "Q: Local WiFi sync in Mavericks 10.9.3 iTunes With iTunes contact and calendar sync over USB reinstated in 10.9.3, does this change also reinstate the ability to locally synchronize over WiFi (i.e. not cloud sync) as is available in Mountain Lion?\nIn ML there is the ability to use WiFi as an alternative to USB to synchronize contacts and calendar locally (not using iCloud).\nBoth USB and local WiFi sync were removed and replaced by iCloud sync in Mavericks. \nThe question is whether or not both functionalities are back with 10.9.3 or only the USB part.\n\nA: Only the ability to sync via USB has been restored. \n", "Q: What is the difference between 'Application' and 'Process' in OS X? As I increasingly dabble with AppleScript and OS X tweaking in general, I arrive at this question:\nWhat is the difference between these two words in terms of OS X's inner operations - e.g. do some processes operate 'within' applications (or vica versa), or two processes operate as part of one 'application' in terms of what the user interacts with GUI-wise (or, vica versa)?\nAlso - I come originally from a Microsoft Windows background. Do 'application' and 'process' have any relationship to 'service' in OS X, (given 'service' and 'program' are different things in Windows), and is there indeed a third category in OS X called 'service' as well?\n\nA: The standard way of approaching these terms is to say that an \"application\" is a specific, static program on storage. It's some piece of code stored on a hard drive, a CD-ROM or elsewhere.\nA \"process\" on the other hand is a specific instance of a running program. I.e. it is registered by the operating system as executing or being able to execute whenever the operating system feels like it.\nIf you take for example Calculator.app, it is a single application.\nHowever you can have multiple Calculator processes if you start the program multiple times.\nAs chananelb wrote, it is also possible to have processes which are not \"just\" ordinary applications that have been started up. That could be for example kernel processes, or simply ordinary processes spawning up subprocesses to do specific tasks.\nRegarding services, I chananelb's answer leads you in the wrong direction. His answer tells you about what is called a \"Service\" in Mac OS X... but you asked about what is called a \"Service\" in Windows.\nThe counterpart to a Windows Service is a Daemon on Mac OS X (and other Unix-derived systems).\nDaemons are normally categorized by running in the \"background\", i.e. without direct user interaction through a graphical or non-graphical user interface. The distinction is a bit blurry though, as a Daemon might for example have a web interface for user interaction.\nDaemons on Mac OS X are controlled by the launchd program, which is responsible for for example starting up daemons on boot, and letting the user start and stop daemons at request.\n\nA: According to the Mac App Programming Guide,\n\nYou use Cocoa to write apps for OS X.\n\nBased on that definition, applications should be packaged in Application Bundles:\n\nApplication bundles are one of the most common types of bundle created by developers. The application bundle stores everything that the application requires for successful operation.\n\nOn the same page, it says:\n\nNote: Although bundles are one way of packaging executable code, they are not the only way that is supported. UNIX shell scripts and command-line tools do not use the bundle structure, neither do static and dynamic shared libraries.\n\nBased on that, I would say that Apple does not consider command-line tools such as ls to be \"applications\".  They would be executable programs or executables.\n\nA process is any instance of a computer program that is being executed.  A process could be created by running either an application or a Unix executable.  (Shell scripts would be a kind of executable where /bin/sh or another shell interprets the script.)\n\"Process\" means the same thing in Windows (see the Process tab in the Windows Task Manager).\n\nService has three different meanings in Mac OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*It could refer to a daemon, which is analogous to a Windows Service.  These are persistent system-wide background processes that do not belong to any user's session.\n\n*It could refer to a Mac OS X-specific feature that facilitates the transfer of data between applications.  For example, there is a \"Make New Sticky Note\" service that lets you convert a text selection into a Sticky Note.\n\n*It can also be used in the generic English sense of the word, as in Launch Services. Launch Services is an API to open applications, and can, for example, decide which is the appropriate application to handle a particular kind of file.\n\nA: An application is a process that can spawn sub-processes (known as children) but some processes are spawned by the OS itself and may not have an 'application' per se behind them. This is (to my understanding) the way unix works in general (unix intro - processes).\nThanks jksoegaard, the following is irrelevant, I misread the question. I'm sort of new - do I delete it or leave it?\nServices in OS X are somewhat similar to the share button in android - its a way for you to send a chunk of data directly from the current app to a different one. \nAn easy example is text - highlighting some text and right-clicking will show you the context menu with services at the bottom, drilling into that menu will show you which other apps on you mac have the ability to use that text for something (e.g. summarize, search web (Chrome), Spotlight, etc). \nYou can modify services in the Keyboard Preference pane under the 'Shortcuts' tab and create your own in Automator see this Ars Technica article for more info.\n\nA: Application: a computer program that performs useful work not related to the computer itself; a piece of software that performs a particular function for the user. Examples include word processing programs, web browsers, presentation programs, and accounting systems. \nProcess: a series of instructions that a computer is executing in a multitasking operating system. Many processes execute concurrently. From the user's viewpoint, processes may be programs or parts of programs (such as the editing routine and the printing routine in a word processor that can print while editing).\nNote that the two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. Simply put, though, an application is a bundled set of processes, which, to the user, appear as one.\nDefinitions from: Dictionary of Internet and Computer Terms\n\nA: To OSX, an Application is an app you can use as a user. A process on the other hand is any running binary executable, also encompassing apps. One app might have multiple processes running etc.\n", "Q: top, group by command Is it possible to run top and group processes by COMMAND?\nSeeing every single individual Chrome process not very helpful\nPID                     COMMAND                           %CPU                  MEM\n0                       kernel_task                       2.5                   1219M\n82793-                  Google Chrome He                  0.0                   427M\n15051-                  Google Chrome He                  5.3                   308M+\n82557-                  Google Chrome                     7.1                   285M-\n14398-                  Google Chrome He                  0.1                   253M-\n14580-                  Google Chrome He                  0.1                   250M+\n90                      WindowServer                      1.8                   218M-\n82626-                  Google Chrome He                  23.1                  194M-\n82666-                  Google Chrome He                  0.2                   191M-\n86580-                  Google Chrome He                  0.7                   171M-\n14596-                  Google Chrome He                  0.5                   164M-\n82630-                  Google Chrome He                  1.0                   141M-\n82633-                  Google Chrome He                  0.1                   135M-\n82622-                  Google Chrome He                  0.5                   134M-\n14592-                  Google Chrome He                  0.4                   131M+\n82632-                  Google Chrome He                  0.2                   130M+\n82663-                  Google Chrome He                  0.4                   130M-\n82623-                  Google Chrome He                  0.4                   124M-\n82621-                  Google Chrome He                  0.5                   119M-\n\n\nA: The key function of top is to offer a life view of all processes in the system, sorted by whatever option you choose.

Load Disk Utility and look in the left sidebar. See if any DMG files are listed there. If they are, even if unmounted, click the DMG file and then the Eject button in the toolbar. If Eject is unavailable simply select the image and press the forward Delete key (Fn-Backspace on laptops). This should cause OS X to \"forget\" about that particular DMG file - at least until you mount it next.\nIf this is happening regularly - DMGs are always persistently remounting - then some extension is most likely causing it. If you removed this \"TotalFinder\" app by just dragging an .app file to the trash, it may not remove any extensions it installs into the OS that do those sorts of things. Look on the Internet - ideally on the software publisher's website - for instructions on completely removing the application, including all support and system files. Many apps that do install stuff deep into the system will come with an uninstaller or at least a shell script that will perform the necessary uninstallation commands for you.\n", "Q: deleting app from terminal from the /Applications folder, I can launch apps on my Mac using the open command in the terminal like this\nopen xcode.app\nopen firefox.app\n\nIs there a way to delete apps from the terminal?

Mac OS X Server 10.6 Snow Leopard Server is no longer for sale at the Apple Store website. Mac OS X Server software licenses were sold as a separate full operating system from Apple until 10.7 Lion, though few realized that the client versions of Mac OS X could always be converted into the Server version product of the Mac OS X System Software (except for Rhapsody) simply by purchasing a license and downloading and installing the OS X Server pkg over the client software, even before the Mac App Store existed, just as it is now the only way to get OS X Server for Lion and subsequent versions of OS X Server.\n\n\n*\n\n*If I purchase a license for and copy of OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard from the Apple Store, and install this on a new Mac Mini, and I update the System to 10.6.8, can I then, through the Mac App Store, purchase a license for and a download a copy of the pkg installer for Mac OS X Server 10.6 Snow Leopard Server from the Mac App Store (which first appears in 10.6.7)? \n\n*Though there may not be the option through the Apple Store web site, in purchasing new hardware today from Apple, if you request it, Apple will sell you a license for and a copy of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and install it for you on the hardware you purchased.

Does anyone know if I should 'zero out' the new disk I bought?  It was NTFS formatted so, unable to use it like that. I did a repartition to HFS+ in seconds, and then decided it might be better to zero out, was this a waste of my time or is there a benefit to this?  Finally this zero out took about an hour and ten mins for 500gb, does this sound like USB 3 performance? - I was expecting it to be faster... my new Macbook Air (which is doing the formatting) is USB 3 and so is the external disk, but 1.1 hrs for a 500gb zero out doesnt seem fast.\n\nA: Zeroing out a brand new disk is, for the average user, a waste of your time. Writing all those zeros to every single block on the disk is time consuming (and yes, your zero-out time seems to be in the ball park even for USB 3) and has no real benefit. The disk, if new, and freshly HFS+ formatted is ready to go without any additional work.\nZeroing out can help the security-paranoid erase latent data from the platters (though, zeroing isn't sufficient to meet US Government regulations for sanitizing media see NIST Special Publication 800-88 for more details). And it can help find and mark bad sectors before you start relying on the media for day to day use. I'll contend that, except for ultra rare cases where new media is heavily damaged on arrival, that modern methods for finding and marking bad sectors in situ are good enough to make pre-finding them before serious use unnecessary in this day and age.\n", "Q: Automate iOS build installation on devices We have a large number of iOS applications which we would like to install on several devices.

Reboot required TLDR; It was a hardware issue.\nMacBook Pro - Mid 2012 \nOS X Mavericks 10.9.3 (and the problem occurs with 10.9.2 as well)\nI'm experiencing some severe WiFi issues. Every 20 minutes or so my Macbook loses its WiFi. This happens at several different locations.\nWhen this happens it looks as if I'm still connected, but I'm not. The drop-down menu does not show any networks. If I turn off WiFi I'm unable to turn it back on again, with a few exceptions (though still no functionality). My guess is that when this happens I've already lost my WiFi completely, the computer just hasn't realized it yet.\nThe shell command airport shows the same behaviour as I'm seeing in the GUI. When I lose the connection, -I gives me AirPort: Off, and if I manage to turn it on, a scan finds nothing.\nAt the time of the problem, the Console doesn't contain anything relevant.\nRebooting the computer always fixes the issue, temporarily. I'm of course looking for a solution to the actual problem, but avoiding a reboot would be very helpful as well, especially since it might get me close to a solution. I've tried to restart the WiFi in various ways, but nothing but the reboot has any effect.\nI found a thread on this subject:\nIs there an equivalent command for 'init.d/networking restart' in OS X\nbut nothing there has worked.\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*ifconfig eth1 down/up\n\n*networksetup -setairportpower en1 off/on\n\n*adding a new Location in the Network settings with no connection options (such as WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, etc.) and switching to this Location and then back to the default\n\n*switching both channels and frequency (40MHz -> 20MHz) on the router, even though I know it's not the router.\n\n\nOne theory is that the network card is starting to fail.

Does having a BootCamp partition somehow make OS X shutdown slow?\nShutting down OS X on my somewhat old (2009) MacBook Pro used to take five seconds or less. But lately I've both installed an SSD and started using BootCamp, and now shutting down OS X -- even when no apps are running and I don't choose to restart apps next time -- takes 23 seconds.\nMy Windows 8.1 and OS X start up are very quickly, and Windows 8.1 shuts down within a few seconds too.\nIt's unfortunate that I installed the SSD and BootCamp so close together, because if one of those is the reason, it's hard to tell which one it might be. But I really doubt an SSD would make it slower. Other possibilities are OS X updates (it was already behaving this way before I installed 10.9.3, so that particular update isn't the culprit), or some background service I might have running (e.g. BetterTouchTool, KeyRemap4MacBook, ShiftIt, VirtualBox, Dropbox, Spotify, ssh-agent; but I was running those things for a long time before this slowdown started).\nI have tried repairing permissions, and using the defaults commands at What is the reason for the slow shutdown?, with no success. (That page asks a more general version of the question I'm asking here.)\nHere is all that was in my console log since I ran the defaults commands until the next startup; I don't see anything in it that suggests a reason for the slow shutdown:\n5/18/14 6:32:38.350 PM login[815]: DEAD_PROCESS: 815 ttys000\n5/18/14 6:32:48.868 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[280]: (com.apple.PackageKit.InstallStatus) Throttling respawn: Will start in 7 seconds\n5/18/14 6:32:48.907 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.907 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.907 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.907 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.907 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.908 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.908 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.908 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.908 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.908 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.908 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.909 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.910 PM WindowServer[130]: CGXGetConnectionProperty: Invalid connection 53003\n5/18/14 6:32:48.933 PM com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.ShareKitHelper[402]) Exited: Killed: 9\n5/18/14 6:32:48.933 PM com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.internetaccounts[404]) Exited: Killed: 9\n5/18/14 6:32:48.945 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[280]: (com.hp.devicemonitor[309]) Exited: Killed: 9\n5/18/14 6:32:49.023 PM UserEventAgent[11]: Captive: [UserAgentDied:142] User Agent @port=68875 Died\n5/18/14 6:32:49.026 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[280]: (com.apple.iTunesHelper.50368[347]) Exited with code: 1\n5/18/14 6:32:49.028 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[280]: (com.apple.gamed[356]) Exited: Killed: 9\n5/18/14 6:32:49.028 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[280]: ([0x0-0x29029].com.apple.AppleSpell[472]) Exited: Killed: 9\n5/18/14 6:32:49.028 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[280]: (com.apple.UserEventAgent-Aqua[284]) Exited: Killed: 9\n5/18/14 6:32:49.111 PM accountsd[362]: /SourceCache/Accounts/Accounts-336.9/ACDAuthenticationPluginManager.m - -[ACDAuthenticationPluginManager credentialForAccount:client:handler:] - 230 - The authentication plugin for account \"echristopherson@gmail.com\" (36AE7882-C0B5-43FC-B2F5-D44F5BB4F987) could not be found!\n5/18/14 6:32:49.111 PM accountsd[362]: /SourceCache/Accounts/Accounts-336.9/ACDAccountStore.m - __62-[ACDAccountStore credentialForAccountWithIdentifier:handler:]_block_invoke389 - 857 - No plugin provides credentials for account echristopherson@gmail.com.

In general, a clean install of OS X with no third party hardware plugged in will shut down in a split second, but once you install a bunch of stuff it starts to take longer and longer.\nYou could narrow it down by testing how long it takes to shut down while at the login screen, or by logging in as a different user (create a new blank user account just to test it) and shut down from there. If it's faster, then it is probably something in your login items that slows things down.\nOr, it could be a kernel extension, system daemon (apache/mysql causes slow shut downs on my mac), mouse driver, printer driver, etc that is causing the slow down. In those cases it won't matter if you are logged in or logged out when you shut down.\nIn general though, you're not looking for a single problem. There are probably 20 or 30 things slowing down your shutdown process. From the look of the log, you sent, it's sending a shutdown message to a bunch of stuff in a single second, then taking about 40 seconds for all of them to actually close. It does not do them one at a time, it does all of them simultaneously.\nYou might want to start by looking into that log message \"No plugin provides credentials for account e.....n@gmail.com.\" - that suggests something on your mac is logging into a remote server during the shutdown process, and probably delaying the shutdown until it gets a response.\nAs for your main question about bootcamp... No. It's highly improbable that Bootcamp causes any performance impact at all, unless you start running very low on disk space (some disks, especially SSD drives, tend to run slower if they are over 90% full).\n", "Q: What are the software for translation on Mac?

My mid-2010 MacBook Pro was diagnosed with the infamous nVidia graphics card defect (I went to an AppleStore two weeks ago, they ran the video system test, and it failed), and since it manifested later than 3 years after purchase, I do not qualify for the free logic board replacement. Still, I'd like this computer to last one more year, and since I get a crash every two weeks or so, it's viable. However, I'd like to make sure that the problem doesn't get worse, and for that I'd like to use the panic logs to monitor the frequency.\nWhich brings me to my problem: my crash logs seem to be disappearing (all my crash logs, though I really only care about panic logs). I noticed first when I went to the AppleStore for the first time that even though the computer crashed twice in the month and a few times before, only the most recent panic log remained. It just crashed again today and the two panic logs I had have vanished in favor of the last one.\nWhere are my crash logs going? Is there a setting I can use to keep them longer? Do I have to copy them over to a \"safe\" location to keep track of them? They are not backed up with Time Machine.\n\nA: System logs, for example, are compressed and then automatically deleted after a week. However, System Diagnostic Reports (whether it be a stall, spin, hang, crash, or panic report) shouldn't be automatically deleted. If you reset the NVRAM immediately following a kernel panic, however, the report is deleted (the NVRAM temporarily stores the report until reboot; if it's reset, the contents are erased). Short of forcibly removing the files (using Onyx, a similar app, or manually), this is the only situation I can come up with off hand as to why a report would vanish.\nAs a makeshift solution, however, you can save the kernel panic reports as a separate file.\n\n*\n\n*From Console's menu bar, View > Show Log List\n\n*Select the panic report (kernel_[longstring].panic) from the \"System Diagnostic Reports\" drop down\n\n*File > Save a Copy As... > save file to folder of your choice\n\n\nUPDATE:\nOnyx is the most likely culprit, however, the option for clearing logs/reports is located in multiple places:\n\n*\n\n*Cleaning > Logs > System Diagnostic Reports\n\n*Automation > Cleaning > Logs, including Diagnostic Reports\n\nUncheck these options if they are checked.\n", "Q: Can someone describe the purpose of OSX root level folders in laymen's terms?

Things the user installs themselves should end up in /usr/local.\n/bin also contains binaries but they tend to be more OS-fundamental than those in /usr - such as cp, cat, bash.\n/sbin is as above but focused on routine administrative tasks such as mount and shutdown.  The s=system/superuser, usually you need root/superuser rights to use these commands. \n/.fseventsd is used by the OS to log file-system change events (such as folder creation) so that interested parties can be notified when the filesystem changes.\nHowever, to run the risk of saying what you didn't want me to say - most of these are of little interest, and if you were to use any, you'd be most likely to be in /usr/local, /var/log or /tmp.\nAdditional information with a focus on the common Unix structure can be found on Wikipedia (Unix File System).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Charging Issues Last night I plugged in my MacBook Pro, and I noticed the light on the charger was a very faint green, hardly visible in bright light.\nToday I opened my Mac and noticed it stated 'batteries not available.'

When I disconnected it before closing lid - Mac went to hibernation as supposed.\nThen I've read on somewhere ( forgot source ) that Mac won't go into hibernation mode until you plug out all external devices ( USB etc. ) and disconnect power adaptor. When it's connected to power it won't go to hibernate under any circumstantes ( so it's better to shut it down if you have to charge it ).\n\nA: Since you have a flash based hard drive this shouldn't be relevant but may be worth ruling out....\nWhen your Mac hibernates it writes the contents of the ram to your hard drive, if your MBA is equipped with a non- flash hard drive  this takes a non-trivial amount of time during which it isn't yet hibernating.

Here I need to masquerade packets through gateway interface.\nShould I have configured anything like a NAT on the bridge between en0 (internet access) and en6?\n\nA: The Internet Sharing service will handle all the translation requirements by itself. For some reason, though, it's necessary to use the Network Preferences pane to manually confirm the information the bridging interface has already come up with on its own. (Since the BBB has its own DHCP server, perhaps the Mac is willing to accept the BBB's DHCP offer in the 192.168.7.x subnet as a suggestion, but then reinforces the fact that as the DNS it holds the keys to the external world, thereby imposing its configuration on the communication process. I don't know. I do digress, however.) \nAfter turning on Internet Sharing for the BBB in the Sharing pane, switch to the Network pane of System Preferences. Select the en6 service in the lefthand window, click \"Advanced\" at the lower right, and select the \"TCP/IP\" pane. If it's not already filled in, Under \"Configure IPv4,\" select \"Manually\" from the drop-down menu, enter 192.168.7.1 for both the IPv4 and router addresses and 255.255.255.252 as the subnet mask. This leaves 192.168.7.2 for the BBB and 192.168.7.3 as the broadcast address. You can ignore the IPv6 configuration section. Next, select the \"DNS\" pane from the top row of tabs. Click on the '+' mark just below the window and add 192.168.7.1.

For some reason this appears to be extremely difficult. What am I missing?\nSteps I've tried so far: \n\n\n*\n\n*Find the first of the photos I want to post\n\n*Click on \"My Photo Stream\", select the thumbnail, and press CMD-C. (Because for some reason you're not allowed to copy the photo while you're actually looking at it.)\n\n*Attempt to paste the photo into a Facebook post. This flatly doesn't work; nothing happens.\n\n*Try clicking \"upload photo\" in Facebook instead. I'm presented with a file dialogue. I suppose I could click \"reveal in Finder\" in iPhoto and drag the file into this dialogue, but I mean, come on, I'm not going to do that for every single photo.\nSo what are my options? I've seen several forum posts from Windows users indicating that on that platform one can just paste photos straight into Facebook posts. Is this impossible on the Mac? Or is there just some extra special thing I've neglected to click on in iPhoto? \nPlease Note: I have \"platform\" turned off in Facebook for good reasons, which means that clicking \"share\" and then \"Facebook\" in iPhoto will not work. I am looking for a way to copy-and-paste photos from iPhoto into another app.\n\nA: It turns out that although you can't do it with CMD-C and CMD-V, you can drag and drop the thumbnail of a photo from iPhoto into Facebook. So I did it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a photo I want to post\n\n*Press the space bar to go back to the thumbnail view. The thumbnail of the photo I was looking at is highlighted in yellow.\n\n*Click-and-drag the highlighted thumbnail and, while holding the mouse button down, press CMD-tab to switch to the browser\n\n*Drop the photo into Facebook\n\n*Repeat for other photos until the post is finished\nIt's not exactly ideal but it did work.

There are different ways to add tags to a file, one of them would be to drag the file on top of the 'tag label' (image).\nI want to set my 'File' to \"In Progress\" and \"Important\" at once using one combined label. Is it possible to add multiple tags at once using OS X Finder only? Maybe using folder-actions or smart-folders? Or maybe by a (unknown) 'copy tags from other file' option?\nIf no OS X Finder solution is possible, what would be a valid solution for this problem?\n \n\nA: Here's two commands that lets you copy tags from one file to another.\nxattr -wx com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags \\\n\"$(xattr -px com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags /path/to/original)\" /path/to/copy\nxattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \\\n\"$(xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /path/to/original)\" /path/to/copy\n\nYou can iterate through various files to copy the tags to multiple destinations. For applying the above to various files based on the results of a find command (which lets you automatically iterate through results of various searches), see my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to tag files (with Finder tags) using parts of a file name?\nHere is a small bash script using the previously mentioned commands. You can use it, for example, in Automator.\n#!/bin/bash\n# copy Tags from 1 file folder to the next\n\nTAGS_FROM=\"$1\"\nTAGS_TO=\"$2\"\n\nif [[ -e \"$TAGS_FROM\" ]] && [[ -e \"$TAGS_TO\" ]]; then\n  xattr -wx com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags \"$(xattr -px com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags \"$TAGS_FROM\")\" \"$TAGS_TO\"\n  xattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \"$(xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo \"$TAGS_FROM\")\" \"$TAGS_TO\"\nelse\n  echo \"Unexpected input, usage:\"\n  echo \"$(basename \"$0\") /path/to/original /path/to/copy\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nHere is an example of an automator/apple-script (still using the bash commandline...). First set some attributes for this automator.app, then drag a file onto the app. The file will then copy the attributes from the automator.app to itself. I am no Applescripter, so improvement is always welcome.\n\n\nA: You can add multiple tags at once using OS X Finder only by selecting a file/folder while clicking the Edit Tags Finder Bar Icon to assign multiple tags to it at once:\n\nAlternatively, simply right click (or Control + click) the file/folder to add or remove tags with ease. \n/I could be misunderstanding your question.\n", "Q: Why is there something white behind the \"slide to unlock\" in my lock screen?

Why is it there and why is it only partially there? The original image looks normal, like this:\n\n\nA: It's just the Slide to Unlock's shinning effect that is less subtle on an iPhone 4 with a black background.\nSome of the iOS7 effects and animations, like Control Center's blurry background, are less fluid and subtle because of the processing power of the device.\n", "Q: How to add sites to the Safari Power Saver exclusion list? In Safari, a feature I really like is that flash plugins are automatically blocked by default and you have to click in order to start the flash plugin (see, e.g., http://mac-fusion.com/manage-the-safari-power-saver-feature/). I found, however, that it prevents Google Play's \"play music\" buttons from working, so I had to temporarily disable the feature (uncheck the \"Stop plug-ins to save power\" box) and restart Safari in order to listen to music on Google Play.\nThere is some sort of exclusion list. I currently have 3 sites listed, but I do not know how they got there. How do I add a site, e.g. play.google.com, to this list?\nI don't see a UI to do this, but perhaps there is a way of editing a plist to insert a new entry?\n\nA: Thanks to Thecafremo's tip, the responsible file is ~/Library/Safari/PlugInOrigins.plist.  I found an AppleScript published by GitHub user crmne (Carmine Paolino), SafariPowerSaverWhitelister.scpt, that is supposed to add entries (https://gist.github.com/crmne/5855a901a0a9a6ef30a5).  You might try it, but it did not work for me in Safari 7.0.3.\nInstead, after clicking on a \"play music\" button, I opened up Web Inspector and ran the following JavaScript on the console:\nwindow.embedElem = document.querySelector(\"embed\");\nembedElem.style.position = \"fixed\";\nembedElem.style.width = \"100px\";\nembedElem.style.height = \"100px\";\nembedElem.style.top = \"500px\";\n\nThere was a 100x100 black square hovering on the left of the page toward the bottom.

Because of the way my work email is set up, I currently have my Mac (at home, running Mavericks) fetching my email via POP from my work's email server. I've been able to access my email over SSH manually, going into the .mbox folders and looking at emails and attachments manually.\nIs there a program I can use to access these emails in a more friendly format? (I'm not a fan of scrolling through pages of .jpeg binary blobs to get to an email.)\nAn additional challenge is that I'm not always going to be able to access from a mac, so I can't just mount the directory and start working with the .mbox directories that way\n\nA: What I would do is first make sure you're using IMAP to connect to your email (which should be the case anyhow —— I can't think of any good reasons to use POP), then use a terminal email client such as Alpine or Mutt, both of which are easily installed with Mac Ports or Homebrew, or built yourself. \nThis way, all your email will be perfectly synchronized, with iPhone, webmail, Mac Mail, Alpine, etc\n\nA: how about mounting the home directory via ssh.\ni beleive this post gives some brief instructions\n\"Mount\" network share as a volume via SSH?\n\nA: I noticed on superuser an accepted answer that suggests using the command-line mail or mailx to browse mbox files:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/448681/how-to-open-browse-an-mbox-file\nI haven't tried this, so not sure if it does what you need, but certainly a place to start.\n", "Q: Pioneer DVD-ROM will not eject after some time of system usage I'm having an odd issue where after my Mac Pro works for a certain amount of time (it seems variable), the drive will no longer seemingly be recognized.

Further, when Toast or any other CD / DVD writing utility is started, the drive is not recognized in these applications.  Any idea as to what could potentially be going on here?\nThe thing that throws me the real curve ball is that it DOES work for a little while when the system is restarted and then just \"disappears\" as noted.\nNOTE: Even when Toast is not in the mix Disk Utility and other apps will not recognize the drive.  It is obviously some kind of an OS issue in terms of it still showing up in the hardware profile, yet no applications are able to detect / use it properly.\n\nA: It turns out that OS X presently does not know how to properly wake all optical drive devices.  Turning off \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" has seemingly resolved it for the time being and this has been reported to Apple.\n\n", "Q: Just activated old iPhone and App Store is trying to make me pay for an app I've already paid for I had an iPhone app on my iPhone 5s now currently under repair that had a $100 app called GIS kit.\nI am connected to my iTunes account with the App Store, and have a bunch of apps that it's allowing me to download via the cloud download icon, but not this one.\nSo, a really quick way to answer this question would be with another question, and that is, does Apple even allow app creators to charge users twice for what is supposed to be a one time payment for an application?\nI just activated this phone, have not done a hard reset or anything like that, so I'm hoping the GIS kit application simply just does not recognize that I have already downloaded it. But it could be something else, worst-case scenario I actually have to pay for it twice. Hope not.\n\nA: No, Apple does not allow app creators to charge users twice for an app already purchased(in this context).\nOf course the developer could create a new app with a new name, but identical content, and in that way try to get people to buy it twice. However that is not the case here.\nAre you sure that you actually bought that program with that specific AppleID - are you sure you didn't buy it with a different ID?\nYou could check your purchasing history for your AppleID on iTunes (App Store).\nAnother thing to try is simply to press Download on the program, even though it doesn't display the Cloud symbol.

The IT staff says I need to provide them with a fully qualified domain name before we can proceed.  So what I need to do is set hostname.subdomain.domain.com.  I've seen some posts about setting hostnames, but what about the rest of this?\n\nA: Open Terminal and type or copy & paste this bash one-liner:\n echo; MyExtIPAddrIs=`curl -s echoip.org`; host -4 $MyExtIPAddrIs|cut -c 22-100; hostname; echo\n\nYour fully qualified domain name will appear after the words \"domain name pointer\" in the line that is output, and continues and includes, after the period at the far right, your mac's internal network address appearing on the next line.\n\nA: Check in the Sharing Preferences Pane in System Preferences. At the top, underneath \"Computer Name\" should be a sentence in small type that gives you that qualified name for your local network. You can also get this by opening /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and typing the command hostname -f and hitting return.\n\nIf you are planning on remote accessing your home machine, you can achieve remote access simply by using your external Internet IP address which you can get from a web service like http://whatsmyip.org or using the command curl echoip.org in terminal when you're at home. Then, when remote, from the Finder, under the Go menu choose \"Connect to Server\" or type command-k and enter vnc://the.ip.address.here and hit return, and this will open up a screen sharing session with whatever machine is port forwarded 5900 at your router.\nBut if your IT staff insists on having your fully qualified domain name, you can get thet using the following instructions:\nOpen Terminal and type or copy & paste this compound command:\n MyExtIPAddrIs=`curl -s echoip.org`; host -4 $MyExtIPAddrIs\n\nYour fully qualified domain name will appear after the words \"domain name pointer\" in the line that is output, and excludes the final period ( . ) at the far right.\n\nPlease note: giving this domain name pointer to your IT staff will not be all that is necessary to achieve remote access. You will need to open the default remote access port to forward the remote access port in your router to your computer's internal network IP address or hostname.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is achieved by using telnet or a browser to access the router's configuration pages. You can get your router's local network address by looking in your Network Preference Pane in System Preferences (once you select the proper interface on the left, perhaps having to hit the advanced button and clicking the TCP/IP tab, the IP of your router will be listed as Router: there). \n\n*Open a browser and enter http:// or https:// and follow it without spaces with your router's internal network address that you just retrieved from Network Preferences. You will likely need your router's admin user name and password. This will be at the default settings if you haven't already set this up, and you can google search for your router's exact model name/number and \"default admin name and password\" to find out what that is, or call your ISP and ask them for it. \n\n*Once in your router's firewall configuration pages, you need to port forward the port that remote desktop uses. For Apple Remote Desktop (and VNC), that port is 5900. So for any incoming requests from the Internet side of your router, you need to port forward 5900 to your computer's internal network address or internal network hostname. Alternatively, you can place your computer in the DMZ, but this will allow all external ports to see your computer, and is not recommended as it will require much better security to protect your computer.\n", "Q: How to get external Apple keyboard to accept modifier key input from Macbook's internal keyboard (and vice-versa)? I just bought an older Apple keyboard, with the idea that I could use it in conjunction with my internal Macbook Pro keyboard as a substitute for buying a keyboard that's capable of splitting into two pieces.  The idea is that I should be able to put my right hand on the external keyboard and my left hand on the internal keyboard and type as usual.\nI plug the external keyboard in and I can type just fine.  The problem comes when I try to use any sort of key combination with both keyboards at the same time.  For example, when I hit the control key on the internal keyboard and the 'e' key on the external keyboard, I would like for the cursor to move to the end of the line but, instead, a lower-case 'e' shows up onscreen.  When I hold the shift key on the external keyboard and hit the 'a' key on the internal keyboard, rather than seeing an upper-case 'A' appear, I get a lower-case 'a'.\nI rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts, macros, and emacs, but besides that, it doesn't make much sense for me to type with using both keyboards if I have to move both hands to one keyboard whenever I want to use an emacs key binding or type a capital letter.\nIs there a way to make one keyboard accept modifier key input from the other?  Ideally, I should be able to hold a modifier key on either keyboard and type another character from either and have OSX recognize a keystroke combination.\nKeyboard:  A1048 (not a new one)\nMacbook Pro:  MacBookPro8,2; 15-inch; Late 2011; Mavericks 10.9.2\n(Unnecessary backstory for the curious:  I'm trying to avert the carpal tunnel I feel coming on from programming on my Macbook keyboard alone.  I'm a pretty wide-shouldered, wide-chested guy and the position I have to take to get my hands close enough together to type on the keyboard has me, essentially, contracting my hand laterally such that the outsides of my palms and my forearms form a 135-degree angle, which is horrible posture.  I need to be able to spread my arms farther apart.)\n\nA: KeyRemap4MacBook\nI knew I had seen this somewhere…\nAll you need to do is install KeyRemap4Macbook.\nFrom the \"implicit behavior\" section:\n\nShare state of modifier keys with all connected keyboards:\nWhen you are using multiple keyboards, modifier keys are shared with all keyboards.\nFor example, pressing \"shift key on keyboard1\" and \"space key on keyboard2\" sends shift-space.\n\nYes, it works on other Macs too, not just MacBooks.\n\nA: I made a utility that does this and works on Sierra.   \nI hope posting this isn't against the rules, but you can grab it here:\nhttps://www.electrollama.net/multimod\n", "Q: Modify the keyboard opt symbols Is there any way to (or existing program which can) modify the keyboard symbols you get when holding down the option key?\nI.e.

Excluding anything in the iTunes Library, what and where (or full relative path is fine) are all of externally called files including preference list files etc used by iTunes X 10.6.3? And by iTunes XI 11.2.1? \nA comprehensive and exhaustive list of what files these 2 separate versions of iTunes access, excluding the iTunes Library and anything inside the application bundle is what I'm after. If they both use identical external files to store their preferences, all the better. If you can give any short explanation on each file, what is stored there, it is also appreciated.\nThe purpose of identifying these files is to aid in the understanding of how to go about having both versions of iTunes installed at the same time, so that I can choose (via a switcher script that may shuffle the files in and out of the correct place) which version to load for the purposes of enabling administration of older iOS devices that are no longer supported in the current version of iTunes.\n\nA: This answer is in two parts. If you're after all the preference files associated with iTunes then the list is relatively short. If you want every file that iTunes accesses then the list is going to be vastly and incredibly long and also very difficult to track down. If you can offer some more context of what reason you're trying to track these down maybe I can help you isolate files related to your needs.\nAll of iTunes preference files:\nFile (Primary): com.apple.iTunes.MACHINE_GUID.plist\nLocated at: /Users/USERNAME/Library/Preferences/ByHost\nFiles: com.apple.iTunesHelper.plist | com.apple.iTunes.plist | com.apple.iTunes.eq.plist\nLocated at: /Users/USERNAME/Library/Preferences\nHidden File: .iTunes Preferences.plist\nLocated at: /Users/USERNAME/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media\nAll of the settings you set/change in the iTunes application are represented in the two primary preference files. The one in the ByHost folder above and the other main one called com.apple.iTunes.plist above.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: This question is answered sufficiently, but it was revealed what I was trying to do... run multiple versions of iTunes on the same system non-concurrently, which is not possible because iTunes is not so much a stand alone app as it is integral with the system (see comments under my question at top). The reason I wanted to do this is because I am running 2 iOS devices at iOS5 with iTunes X, but I just acquired an iOS7 device, requiring iTunes XI, and knowing Apple's modus operandi of surreptitiously removing functionality, I did not want to blindly update my system's iTunes to 11.\nHere's what I did instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*copied my entire iTunes Library to an external drive\n\n*installed a near identical system on a 16GB SD Card, same username as my main system\n\n*room on the card was tight, so I disabled SafeSleep mode thusly:\n\n\nsudo pmset hibernatemode 0; sudo rm -rf /var/vm/sleepimage which gave me back a whopping 8GB of disk space\n\n\n*\n\n*downloaded the iTunes XI installer from Apple and installed it\n\n*ran softwareupdate and applied appropriate updates including iTunes patch\n\n*made a softlink from ~/Music/iTunes to the duplicate iTunes Library on the external drive\n\n*launched iTunes and signed in, and because of the near identical system, Apple didn't even recognize it as different, so I did not have to authorize a new system\n\n\nNow I can sync my iOS7 device with iTunes XI without affecting my main system and the iTunes X install there by booting from the SD Card when I wish to sync my iOS7 device.\nI realize that eventually the 2 iTunes Libraries will diverge enough to become annoying, but it should take awhile as the only thing that changes these days are the apps I download for iOS (my music library doesn't change that often).\nI'll have to manually keep track of what changes I make within certain apps such as GoodReader and iBooks to keep them in sync on all the devices (or I could use iCloud to backup app data and keep my apps synced that way), but at least I have local storage of backups of my iOS7 device, and can sync my music, books, movies, etc. \nThe situation is not ideal, but I am extremely pleased with it as I won't be backing up the iOS7 device on a very regular basis, and I find iTunes XI to be deplorable (iTunes X is bad enough for its bloat and feature creep, its slow, but it lets me do what I want... but iTunes XI removes nearly all user control, has inscrutable automation routines that can't be stopped, and is overall what I would call \"junk software.\" I'm not sure how other users tolerate it! Doesn't anyone miss being able to have the autonomy to be able to control how your iOS devices are managed without having to fight the software for that control?

Make sure your computer's subnet and the subnet of your Apple TV are the same. The hotel may have it configured strangely.\nTo get your computer's subnet go to System Preferences > Network > Wifi and click the Advanced button then go to the TCP/IP tab. Your Subtnet Mask is shown there and it should match the one the Apple TV is using.\nAlso (if possible) try and ensure your Apple TV and your Mac are both updated to the latest software available. Apple's support pages also recommend resetting the Apple TV, but I understand that may not be possible in a hotel.\nHonestly your best bet is to contact the hotel front desk, since they will be able to do more advanced resets if needed and change the subnet as well.\n", "Q: How to fix permission denied for home folder with Apache in Mavericks?

Should the terminal stick to the bottom when I scrolled all the way down?\nI created this terminal oneliner to try it out for yourself (downloads the linux kernel at 10k and outputs it to the terminal):\ncurl --limit-rate 10k https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/testing/linux-3.15-rc5.tar.xz\n\n\n\nA: Not related to the trackpad, but you can use your keyboard to scroll to the bottom of the document and be sure it sticks to it!\nPress fn + RightArrow\n\nA: The issue here is that the scroll is still going when the text continues to be output. The trackpad is still in a \"scroll mode\" in which Terminal doesn't check the position and waits until it's done.\nThis was originally so it would wait until your fingers are off the trackpad/you stop scrolling. With inertia scrolling, this scroll mode doesn't end until the velocity reaches 0. So, the terminal waits until it is 0, by which time the output has increased and it won't stick to the bottom. (This isn't as noticeable in Terminal due to the lack of rubber banding.)\nSo I guess it would technically be expected behavior but it is still undesired behavior :P\n", "Q: Lost iPhone but someone is trying to use it - how can I track this My iPhone was stolen and I have blocked it, recently I received an email stating that I reported a problem...

If you don't have Find My iPhone, try contacting your service provider to see if they can get a lock on the phone's location. \n", "Q: Is my computer infected by the Recycler virus? I installed Parallels Desktop for Mac and installed Windows 7. It seems like I loaded an infected file and now there are some $RECYCLER.bin folders around some places. Is this the Recycler virus? How can  I delete these files? Do I just delete the Parallels VM or do I have to do something else?\n\nA: I presume you're referring to folders called $RECYCLE.bin and not RECYCLER (the latter is the recycler virus created folder).\nThese $RECYCLE.bin folders exist because they're created by Windows (through Parallels) because of the shared folders feature in Parallels (using which you can access folders on the other OS directly). These are not from a virus and you should just leave them as they are - they hold files/folders you delete.\nThis thread titled \"$RECYCLE.BIN folder created?\" in the Parallels forum provides a concise answer from the support team:\n\nThe $RECYCLE.BIN folder is created due to the shared folders and shared profile of Parallels.\nYou can disable it under Virtual Machine -> Configure -> Shared Folders.\n\n\nTo make things simpler in your usage of Parallels, you may also want to explore the \"Levels of integration - Like a Mac or Like a PC\" knowledgebase article.\n", "Q: After update OS X 10.9.3 MacBook Pro 2010, Restart suddenly Yesterday I get OS X 10.9.3 after update, my MBP 2010 getting restart when I open VLC, Illustrator and sometimes Safari. The message shows \"Your Computer restarted because of a Problem. Press any key to continue starting up\".\nWhy this happen?\n\nA: There are reports of Dropbox causing kernel panics on 10.9.3. If you have Dropbox installed, try quitting the dropbox agent. If the kernel panics cease, then wait for Dropbox to update their software.\nFirst, click the dropbox icon in the menu bar, then click the gear icon in the bottom-right.\n\nThen quit Dropbox from the popup menu.\n\n\nA: Sounds like a kernel problem. It could be that you have a corrupt hard drive and that the installation was garbled during the install. It could be that you had a corrupted version of the installer (though it likely wouldn't have finished installing were that the case). You should run disk utility to verify your drive isn't damaged, then reinstall the OS.\n", "Q: What is CUPS on port 631? I recently ran an NMAP scan of my Mac's open ports and discovered port 631 (ipp) was open. Intrigued, I saw it was for the CUPS web interface, and after enabling it I found it had something to do with printing. But what exactly is CUPS?\n\nA: From the CUPS website:\n\nCUPS is the standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple Inc. for OS X and other UNIX®-like operating systems.\n\nOn OS X it provides local printer services as well as shared printer services for other Macs to access your printer via the service if the printer doesn't have its own sharing capabilities. CUPS has become fairly ubiquitous across the Linux/UNIX contingent of OSes as the print server if choice.\nThat open port you found is because printer sharing is turned on on your machine. You can close port via System Preferences > Sharing and uncheck Printer Sharing.\n\nA: Actually CUPS (the Common Unix Printing System) was an open source project that Apple bought. Contrary to what is listed at CUPS.org, CUPS existed long before Apple bought it.\nI understand that CUPS remains Open Source and that (some?) code contributed by Apple works it's way back into the Open Source version available to and used by other O/S'\nNote that CUPS is an excellent (though somewhat complicated) web interface to the printing subsystem on the Mac. In some rare cases it is possible to add and manage printers that do not offer a printer driver for the current version of Mac O/S but do offer one that works with CUPS.\n\nA: The open port is for internal (localhost) services only. It should not be visible to a remote host, e.g. via the 'nmap' utility.\n", "Q: iTunes, even when not playing, keeping my computer from sleeping automatically I'm using the default Energy Save preferences on a MBPro running Mavericks.

Our school teacher is using an iPad to take photo's of their artwork, etc and then using Pages (on the same iPad) .. creating a quick 'page' or two (inserting their artwork) and then emailing the page to the parents (as a pdf).\nUnfortunately, the pdf is massive. Too big for most of us.\nI'm guessing this is because the PDF is using the original size of the images. \nWhen I send images as attachments in an email on my iPhone I get asked which size I would like - eg original, or small, etc. etc.\nQ1. Is there a way we can get Pages to use a smaller image size? \nQ2. When I sent an email to myself from that iPad and attached a single image, I was not asked to resize it :( Is there a way to do that, also?\nOtherwise - what options do we have?\nWe do not what to leave the iPad to send these images. (ie. sync somehow and then use a desktop to do all of this).\nPlease help!\n\nA: Best is to reduce the photos before they are added to Pages. \nFor printing they do not have to be more than 300 dpi. \nFor viewing on the screen about 75 - 100 dpi. \nPages doesn't do the job as you found out. \nYou can do it in Preview > tools > Adjust size (on a Mac)\nIf do not ant to leave the iPad then you can use one of the many external apps to do it.\nSimple Resize (Free)\n\nor Image Resizer+ ($0.99)\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Info:\nThe Resolution has the biggest impact on the file size, not so the size of the image.\n\nA: There is not a lot you can do once the document is already with you, other than resampling the entire PDF into a lower quality document to lower the size.  This is possible, but I am unsure from your question what device you are receiving the emails on (you make it clear how they are sent), so I don;t know whether to point you at an iOS, Windows or OS X tool to do this.\nHowever, I think that a workflow solution for your teacher is more appropriate, rather than trying to fix it after they have already sent you a large file with full resolution pictures included.  As such requesting them to send a reduced resolution picture in the document in the first place seems the easiest way.\nThis can be done easily enough on iOS, but not within the standard photo viewer app which can only crop or alter aspect ratios etc, so you will need to get a 3rd party app to do it for you.  There are many to choose from on iOS, I personally use one called ResizeHandler (I should note that this is an iPhone app, not universal for iPad also, but it works just the same in 2x mode).  Although it's not one of the free ones I find it is one of the simplest, allowing you to reduce a photo to specific preset dimensions with a single click (custom with a few more clicks)\n\n\nA: In Pages '09 v4 you can just right click on an images in Pages and select Reduce Image File Size. Seems to work.\n\nA: Take the photo from a little further away then crop it.\n", "Q: Are there iphone apps or automation for taking photos and sharing low resolution versions? I need to take low resolution photos on iPhone5 like at 640*480, 320*240 etc. Low resolution photo is so that they can be uploaded easily.

Others may shoot lower than this, but I am not aware of any specifically.\n\nA: You could use the front facing camera to achieve much lower resolution :)\nThere are also some fun apps that simulate the GameBoy camera or similar very low resolution cameras. But even they save the image scaled up, in order to actually be watchable (despite being pixelized).\nFor video there are apps that output in low resolution as well, like this https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mrcamera/id546003651\n\nA: I use this app called LOWER, you can choose different resolutions from 120p to 720p, you can even do custom resolutions as low as 50x50\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lower-very-low-res-camera/id1265794764?mt=8\n", "Q: using iMac 2008 (display port) as external monitor with MacBook Pro 2013 (thunderbolt) I am trying to connect a MacBook Pro 2013 to an iMac 2008.

However, not only I didn't receive any update notification on my App Store, it refuses to even recognize my installation! When I visit the LPX link on my App Store, it shows the price instead of \"installed\" like it says for Aperture, iWork, Garageband, etc. How can I make it recognize the installation?\nP.S. Elsewhere, someone had suggested renaming the app to Logic Pro (removing the \"X\"). I did try it and unfortunately it didn't work.\n\nA: Logic Pro X is only available on the Mac App Store and the Logic Pro X bundle will contain a MASReceipt that tells the Mac App Store who the app is registered to.\nThis means the Mac App Store won't claim knowledge of the app unless you are signed in with the Apple ID that you used to purchase it. As you say you didn't purchase it from the Mac App Store, it won't be assigned to your Apple ID and the Mac App Store won't update it for you as it sees it immediately as pirated software.\nAperture is available elsewhere on physical media. This means that there won't be a Mac App Store receipt assigned to the app and the app can be assigned to an Apple ID.\nThis means that the Mac App Store will assign your Aperture that was purchased outside of the Mac App Store to the currently logged in Apple ID.

Or at least such that if I import it to iTunes once, it will automatically be imported to the iTunes library on the other computer?\nI noticed one thing: The library files of the iTunes on my old MacBook are placed in \".../Music/iTunes/iTunes Music\". Even if I choose a new location for the iTunes library, as long as I leave \"Keep iTunes Media folder organized\" unchecked, it doesn't move the library files to that new location. Thus, I don't know how to move the location of the library files to the Dropbox. Even if I would know, I'm not sure whether things would work because the Dropbox folder does not have the same full location string on the two computers because, for example, the home folders have different names. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: You can put your entire iTunes library (not just the music files) into the Dropbox and create iTunes aliases in your ~/Music folder on both computers, as long as the paths are identical. This means you need to use the same user name on both machines. Ie., /Users/Username/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music. Then, when you add music to iTunes on one machine, when the library syncs over Dropbox, the music will be present on the other machine.\n", "Q: How to install memcache on Mavericks?

When I connect the USB connector to an Apple 12W USB Power Adapter and plug the dock connector into my iPad 3, I get the \"Not Charging\" message next to the battery icon. The cable works fine with iPods and iPhones. The normal Apple 3m cable works fine. I know the message is caused by not supplying enough current from the charger, and that charging still takes place, just slowly, but how is this possible? It seems that the iPad 3 requires around 2 amps (10W/5V) of current to satisfy its power hunger. 12W would theoretically supple even more current (12W/5V=2.4A). So what could be causing this apparent \"current deficit\"? Certainly a 10m wire could not have enough resistance to cause such a large current drop. This is DC so there can be no impedance issues. I doubt the soldering is so sloppy that the joints would have a high resistance but you never know… I have two such cables and both display the same behavior. I can't measure anything in the dock connector with a VOM because the opening and the pins are too small. What are some other possibilities that would reduce the current so much?\nAdditional information:\nI was able to ring out the +5V (pin 1) and GND (pin 4) pins of the USB connector of both 3m cables and I found that the GND pin is NOT connected to the outer grounding shell of the connector like it is on the official Apple cable so that definitely is a problem. It means the USB +5V is floating and USB GND is not tied in with other GND pins. Geeze…\nUSB pinouts:\nhttp://pinouts.ru/visual/USB.jpg\nApple dock connector pinouts:\nhttp://www.allpinouts.org/index.php/Apple_iPod,_iPad_and_iPhone_dock\n\nA: I know Apple's answer - 'our cable works, there is no problem'.\nIN SUMMARY - you either need to use Apple's own cables or the decent quality PC World versions or Asda or something, that are not really cheap but are two thirds the price of Apple, or half or something.  \nReally cheap clone cables will NOT work.  Can't explain it, but know it is fact.  My guess, they are not soldered properly inside the lightning end, and ipad depends on quality of connection being really good, maybe?  Any money, not all the connector bits on the lightning are connected physically to the other end.  ie it gets complicated.\nExplanation follows:\nI have found that Apples' own cable supplied (lightning) tends to kink near the ipad end, and horribly shorts out resulting in two main issues: a - ipad reboots or similar alarming thing b - it doesn't charge c- the charger that is on the plug gets very hot indeed, but the give-away is that unlike when charging the ipad properly, the back of the ipad where the battery/charging components are, remains completely cool to the touch.\nSo, it's the difference with your 3m cable to Apple's one.  I have bought several 'clone' cables AND NONE OF THEM WORK.  Short or long, makes no difference.  I keep them in a bag marked 'cheap useless aftermarket cables'. If you go to PC World or somewhere similar that sells cables for over a tenner apiece, they'll probably work.\nIf the cable costs 2.50 gbp ir probably WON't work, that's my experience.\nYou don't reveal where you bought the non-apple cable?  ASDA and places like PC World, their cables will work even non-apple ones.  Others might not.\nLast, the earthing (ground) thing.  Generally, for signal-level power, only one end of the ground cable is earthed.  I know the house-wiring norm is for all of them to be tied together - so I guess it depends which way Apple leaned on this one.  Lightning adaptor of course, reconfigures uses of each contact, so which one is ground may not even stay the same?\n", "Q: ssh-askpass on Mac OS 10.9/Mavericks broken?

Might be cleaner ways to ensure DISPLAY is set.\n\nA: I'm on 10.9 and @jstrom's solution didn't work for me. For me, the DISPLAY variable was already being set. The problem was a missing ssh-askpass program:\n[q@haywire/0 ~] ls /usr/libexec/ssh-askpass\nls: /usr/libexec/ssh-askpass: No such file or directory\necho $SSH_ASKPASS\n(no output)\n\nYou can fix this by using a custom ssh-askpass program such as jcs's (requires CocoaDialog) or markcarver's.\nI prefer to copy this program to ~/bin/ssh-askpass. This requires specifying this location in the SSH_ASKPASS variable; add this to your ~/.bash_profile:\nexport SSH_ASKPASS=~/bin/ssh-askpass\n\nYou may also need to make this variable available in launchd context:\nlaunchctl setenv SSH_ASKPASS $SSH_ASKPASS\n\nBefore it works, you'll need to restart or at least kill and restart the ssh-agent:\nkillall ssh-agent\nssh-add -c -t 1h\n\n\nA: In addition to using the various replacements for ssh-askpass, I put this code in my ~/.bashrc to ensure the launchd environment is always properly set every time I start a shell. Placing this in ~/.bash_profile did not yield consistent results and this code executes very quickly so running it every time a shell starts isn't an issue.\nI set DISPLAY here to avoid having to add it as a key in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist, plus it avoids having to edit stock plists.

I want to know list of folders that can be safely excluded from Time Machine backups while ensuring that full restore can get me a same machine running immediately.\nThe reason why I want to do this is because Time Machine will backup all the files no matter what it contains. So far, I’ve excluded these paths from my backup:\n~/Library/Caches\n~/Library/Logs\n~/Downloads\n\nCaches and Logs don’t need to be backed up because they’re generated when needed. I’m also excluding ~/Downloads folder because those files are usually stored temporarily.\nIs there any more folders that I can exclude? What is your Time Machine’s exclusion rules?\n\nA: If you're using services such as Dropbox and Google Drive, then it's safe to exclude these from the Time Machine backups since they will be retrieved from the Internet in case you need to recover your system.\n\nA: The simple answer is to exclude any files that you create or download that you won't need for a restore (this includes files that you're able to re-download or restore/rebuild from another source if necessary).\nTime Machine does not actually backup everything. On the contrary, by default it is configured intelligently to exclude folders like ~/Library/Caches, ~/Library/Logs and many others that are temporary in nature, can be rebuilt from available data and are not required during a system restore. Adding these folders to your exclusion list is not necessary and is redundant.\nThe default list of files and folders that Time Machine excludes from its backup is listed in /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist. You can verify that the caches and logs folders are in this exclusion list.\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*What should I exclude, and what should I not exclude?.\n\n*How can I find exactly what files are included in my last Time Machine backup?\n\n*On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?\nPersonally, I exclude two kinds of folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Folders that contain temporarily used files that I can get from another source if I need them.\n\n*Folders containing large files that may change frequently. For example, large media files that I may add and delete often are excluded from Time Machine because they would fill up the backup disk very quickly. Those are, however, covered in a full disk clone (that I manage with a limited backup of older files).\n\n", "Q: If you lock out your iphone and put it in lost mode does it still connect to internet?

But I am wondering if the phone is locked out and they don't have access to it, does it still connect to internet to be tracked?\nI have lost my iphone before and gotten it back, and I did see the location of it......\n\nA: Putting an iPhone in Lost Mode does not stop you from seeing your phone's location. It may be offline because the battery drained. It's also possible for a person that has the iPhone to power it down in the normal way using the Sleep button and on-screen slider. Regarding being notified of its location if it connects to the internet again, you may find this information helpful: \nFrom http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2698:\n\nIf Find My iPhone can’t locate a device, the last known location is displayed for up to 24 hours.

The iOS device needs only to be online. How does Apple define online for an iOS device?:\n\n\"An iOS device is online if it’s turned on (with or without a passcode lock) and connected to a data network, such as EDGE, 3G, 4G, or Wi-Fi. \"\n\nSo, if your device is online, here's how to track it:\n\nLocate your iOS device:\n  Sign in to icloud.com/#find with your Apple ID (the one you use with iCloud).\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If you’re using another iCloud app, click the app’s name at the top of the iCloud.com window, then click Find My iPhone.\n  \n*Click All Devices, then select the device you want to locate.\n  \n*In the list, the dot next to the device indicates its status:\n  \n*A green dot  means it’s online.\n  \n*A gray dot  means it’s offline.\n  \n*If the device is online, its approximate location is shown on the map.

It seems as when it does begin to backup, it happens so quick, so there must be some knowledge of file changes. \n\nA: The first place to look for some in-depth Time Machine information is the late James Pond's web site: pondini.org.

This partition needs to be only a couple hundred MB big because it's only going to be storing GRUB bootloader, i.e. a boot.efi file and some other small files, so when I hold the \"option\" key while booting I can boot into the appropriate Linux distribution I have setup.  Is it possible to create a 128MB partition with a HFS+ filesystem?  I would prefer to used the \"diskutil\" command line program over using the GUI app \"Disk utility\".\n\nA: So I ended up booting into an ArchLinux live environment, and created a 128MB partition using \"cgdisk\" then installed hfsprogs.

These links are redirects to information stored in a different folder or separate hard drive in your system. This allows for multiple paths to the same files and folders.\nSome software applications can not distinguish a symlink from a valid directory and will report multiple copies of the same files and folders. There is really only one copy of the data but symlinks allow for different permissions to be applied to the application or users.\nIf you do a ls -la command from the terminal the first character of the permission will be the letter l (ex. lrwxr-xr-x) directories start with the letter d and files start with a dash '-' and the file name of a link will look something like this;\n lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  hidden   11B Jan 10  2014 etc -> private/etc\n\nThe first part is the file/folder name that the system is looking for and the part after the -> is the fully qualified path to the actual location of the data data.

So, I'm very new to Apple products and am feeling a bit naive about it all - so, forgive me if this sounds a bit stupid!\n\nI am thinking about purchasing a used iPod touch 5th gen 64gb and I am wondering how a factory reset is done and if I can do it myself or if I would need to take it to a store. As well as how much does a reset do? Does it remove the previous user's junk?\n\nA: If your buying a used iPod Touch whoever sold it to you will probably (and should) reset the device.   If its not or you just want to reset it you can do it by going into Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings\n", "Q: Macbook pro, disk utility and external hard drive I have a Macbook Pro running on Lion.  My external hard drive is a Buffalo and used as data backup only, and is formatted to Macs.\nI have used the ext. hard drive for two years with no issues. I am considering running \"disk utility\" (specifically \"verify disk\") to check its health.  Is there a minimum or maximum amount of times you can run it on an external hard drive?  I am aware of the different types of software you can buy, but running \"disk utility\" on an external hard drive is my only option right now.\n\nA: Internal or external makes no difference. it wont damage the disk in any way, it does not use up \"write-cycles\".\nthe only useless option would be running verify permissions if you dont have an OSX installation on it.\n", "Q: how to upgrade my Hard drive on MacBook pro I have a MacBook pro version 10.9.3 with 2.9 GHz Intel core i7 processor. 8GB of ram and a 750GB HD. I'm running windows through parallels and allocated 4GM of memory to it and a used my bootcamp image (400gb).\nWhen running parallels both sides are slow. I thought that maybe buying a SSD would speed things up. Is this true? If So will I be able to back up my partition when upgrading? What would be the best way to go about it? \nThanks for any advice!\n\nA: \nI thought that maybe buying a SSD would speed things up. Is this true?\n\nThe simple answer is yes. It sounds as though you may also be paging out due to RAM limitations as well, however. When you run out of RAM, your machine uses your drive as a  disk cache, essentially, which slows down your machine ( a HDD/SSD is meant to be a dedicated storage device, not temporary). That being said, upgrading to a SSD would still make the machine quicker even if you are paging out. \n\nIf So will I be able to back up my partition when upgrading? What would be the best way to go about it?\n\nYes, you will be able to back up the other partition. I highly recommend following this clear and concise guide, by ASC member clintonfrombirmingham when doing so. \n\nA: If you need to keep the original Bootcamp partition as well as the OS X partition, then I would recommend that you use something like Winclone to make an image of the Bootcamp partition.\nIn this case, I would suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy an SSD that is larger than the minimum size you need (including the size of your current Bootcamp partition).\n\n*Use Winclone to create an image of your Bootcamp partition, and put this somewhere safe..\n\n*Install the SSD in the Mac.\n\n*Put the old Hard Disk Drive into an external enclosure.\n\n*Boot from the external enclosure\n\n*Use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the HDD's OS X partition to the SSD.\n\n*Boot from the newly-created OS X partition on the SSD.\n\n*Marvel at how much FASTER everything is. Just ... lovely.\n\n*Create a Bootcamp partition using the Bootcamp Assistant, and let it think you are going to install Windows on it. Make sure it is at least as large as the original Bootcamp partition.\n\n*Use Winclone to put the image created in step 2 onto the newly-created Bootcamp partition.\n\n*Make sure Bootcamp still works, by booting into it. While in there, resize the NTFS filesystem to fill the partition.\n\n*Reboot into OS X and start Parallels, using the (new) Bootcamp partition.\n\n*There is no step 13!\n\n\nThat should all work, pretty much. It's all complicated by having the Bootcamp partition, as you can see.\n\nA: I have a similar setup for developing and have very few problems with the speed of the VM, but switching to an SSD did help incredibly in load times on both sides.  That was most of the delays I was experiencing in the VM, with the type of programs I use.  It's much more pleasant to use now... \nI do this each time I upgrade the HDD.  Since it is the first time, you do have to go out and buy an empty enclosure.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an external enclosure (preferably something with FireWire 800 for speed)\n\n*\n\n*I like Macally (something like this).  Mine has lasted for close to 4 years.\n\n\n*Get a copy of Carbon Copy Cloner (or similar) and install it\n\n*Put the new SSD drive in the external enclosure\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the drives are the same size, or the new one is bigger\n\n\n*Use the cloner to make a duplicate of your internal drive to the external\n\n*\n\n*You will need to partition the SSD first, of course (osx hfs+ journaled)\n\n*This will take at least a few hours\n\n*It should tell you that the partition will be \"bootable\" after this\n\n\n*Turn everything off\n\n*Swap the drives (ssd => internal, internal => external enclosure)\n\n*Turn it back on.  Everything should be exactly the same now, only faster.\n\n\nYou don't have to do it exactly this way, but it's safer to keep the computer running and clone to the external drive first.  If something goes wrong cloning you still have the machine running as normal.\nBonus:\n\n\n*\n\n*You now have an exact bootable backup.  Backup weekly to the external using the same tool.\n\n*If you need, you can plug it into the FW port and boot off it directly\n\n", "Q: Laptop charger plug differences My Macbook Pro charger (purchased in the US) comes with two different plug attachments, one that fits directly into the body of the charger and one with an extension cord.  For some reason, the short attachment has only two prongs, while the long one has an additional ground pin.  What is the function of the ground pin on the long attachment?  Is it really necessary?\n\nA: The third pin is a ground pin. It is required in some countries for devices with a metal surface to prevent shocks in case of a short-circuit.\nSince they also delivered a plug with only two pins to you, in your country it seems to be ok to use without grounding. If you want to be absolutely on the safe side, use the three pin cable.\nMore info.\n", "Q: What's up with \"paused\" applications in Launchpad? When I activate Launch on both my Mavericks and Mountain Lion systems, a few of the application icons are (seemingly permanently) greyed out and marked \"Paused\" with an empty progress bar.\n\nIt isn't hurting anything, but it's weird.\nAny idea why?\n\nA: It seems as if the download was started from the App Store and it was paused for some reason. There are two ways that you can get it to not say that anymore.\n\n\n*\n\n*Single Click on the icon to resume the download.\n\n*Click and hold, the press the \"X\" on the top left corner of the app to delete it.

This is a follow-up to this question.\nIn short: I need to buy an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.0 (and this version specifically, not the latest 7.1).\nI have mailed an Apple reseller asking if they had any in stock only to learn that Apple does not print any information about iOS version on the box so they cannot tell me. I thought if there were a way to identify what version of iOS is installed based on serial number or some other indicators I could ask resellers very specific questions (i.e. Have you got any XYZ series iPhones in stock?).\nMy questions are: is it possible to recognise the iOS version based on serial number or any other factor in a new iPhone? If yes, how do I do that? \nTo be more specific: I would like to identify a range of serial numbers of iPhone 4S that shipped with iOS 7.0 installed as the original system. Is that possible?\n\nA: The serial number will allow you to view the model and technical specifications of the phone. Using this information, you can 1) find the original iOS the phone ran, and 2) find out the iOS(s) with which the device is compatible with. \nHowever, you can't remotely find the current iOS version or specific update to that version based on the serial number alone.\n\nA: With the serial number, you could check the manufacture date against the release dat elf the version of iOS that you want. However, there'd be no guarantees (I don't know when Apple starts preloading iOS updates on new phones vs. when the software is released to the public or how precise the manufacture date tool is).\nhttp://www.appleserialnumberinfo.com/Desktop/index.php via https://discussions.apple.com/message/22794243#22794243\n", "Q: Why doesn't my MacBook Pro Retina connect to 802.11n? I've bought a 15\" MacBook Pro Retina Late 2013 and so far everything works perfectly. Luckily I'm not experiencing the \"Lose Wifi after sleep\" issue. \nThat said, I only rarely connect to high-bandwidth WiFis. I'm currently working with a colleague from his home office. He has a Netgear router capable of 802.11n and his MacBook Pro (also Retina, but not late 2013, so he doesn't have the ac card) connects using 802.11n and 2.4GHz on channel 1 without a problem. My MBP however connects on the same channel using only 802.11g which is pretty slow when we want to transfer files.\nThe WirelessDiagnostics report shows I connected to a 5GHz 802.11n yesterday when we were at the client's office.\nWhat can I do to fix or at least diagnose the problem? Is it just Mavericks, or a driver issue with these new ac cards?\n\nA: I had the same problem with my rMBP 15\" late 2013. Like Exact same problem.

If it breaks wifi(99.5% chance it wont) or makes it worse then repeat these step and reinstall the original Kext that you backed up in Step 1.\n\nA: For some people, this might be the reason:\nIf you purchase a Mac book from overseas, and your router from your home country, the WIFI frequency band can be incompatible, causing you to be unable to connect to 802.11n\n", "Q: Turn off notification for certain messages Is it possible to turn of notifications for certain mail messages (ex. newsletters)?\n\nA: You can create a filter, which makes them automatically read, and therefor no message. A downside is that you need to create a filter (or rule) for every newsletter (or whatever you want to block) you receive. This way you will not receive a notification, but it isn't removed from your inbox.\n", "Q: Missing a lot of options from Finder's right click context menu No idea what caused this or why it's happening, but when I right click something in Finder  I'm missing a lot of the standard options that should be there (dropbox options, labels, etc).

Reinstall Dropbox with the newest version.\n\nDropbox uses a \"hack\" which extends the Finder (in an unsupported way) to provide this \"sharing\" link.  Because these \"hacks\" can cause crashes, Apple tends to disable them when newer versions of OS X ship. There's probably a newer version of DropBox that gets around these restrictions that you'll need to download.\n\nSource: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5577081\n\nA: Will, are you using TotalFinder?

Which will have the string value of for example com.apple.iChat.Styles.Balloons.\nOnce both entries exist then the setting participantDisplay is actually actioned.\nI used Defaults delete,write to remove and replace these settings and the results are consistent.\n", "Q: sudo access to specific folder On OS X Mavericks, I want to install few files without prompting user for sudo password. (Folder where i am trying to install require root access because it is present at / location). I can do this by modifying \"sudoer\" file and disable sudo password but this is unsafe and open up security risk.\nIs there any way I can provide sudo access only a particular folder? So when I try to write to this folder, sudo password prompt is not visible to user.\n(All above task are done through command line)\n\nA: Don't modify the sudoers file. It isn't necessary. I think what you mean is \"is there anyway I can alter ownership and permissions so sudo isn't required?\" Yes. You can modify the folder's permissions and ownership settings using Terminal. Note, you will have to use sudo to do so and the command must be run by an administrator. \nsudo chown -R $UID:staff /path/to/folder; chmod -R 755 /path/to/folder; exit\n\nSubstitute \"/path/to/folder\" with the proper path. The \"chown\" command changes ownership of the directory to you (and it's subfolders, using the -R option). The \"chmod\" command sets the folder's permissions to readable/executable by everyone and writable by the owner (you) only. \n", "Q: Problems Accessing (Synology) NAS over AFP directly over the finder and time machine with Mavericks MBPr we have two Macs, an older iMac and a MBPr both with Mavericks (10.9.3). Only one of them has a very annoying problem with our new synology ds214+.\nWith the iMac I can access the NAS over the the finder symbol (both AFP and SMB). Also time machine finds the time machine folder on the NAS which was configured over the synology dsm software. \nThe MBPr on the other hand can access the NAS over different ways: AFP from the browser \"afp://ip.adress\", smb over the finder symbol. \nBut there is no way I can get it to work with time machine or AFP over the finder symbol.

I even tried to reinstall OS X from a backup with no success either.\nI am wondering if there might be any connection to the fact, that my MBPr doesn't connect to the apple software update server either.\nI am thankful for any advice.\n\nA: add the nas hostname and IP to the MAC \"hosts\" file, that's how fixed it today.\nto edit the host file on a MAC, best way is through terminal, google it.\nGood luck\n\nA: I wonder if it has to do with the fact that the other Mac is already reserving the disk for use with Time Machine.\nI have a very similar setup and could try this myself on monday when I'm back at that computer.\nUntil then, I suggest you try adding another small partition to the DS, e.g. by using any free space left on the internal disk, or by pluggin a USB drive into it. Then make this volume available via AFP as well, and see if both your Macs can access it normally. That would prove that it has to do with the particular shared partition and not with the network setup.\n\nA: I'm having a similar issue with DSM 5.1.5021 update 2.\nTry connecting over finder with ctrl+K and then entering the fully qualified path, e.g : afp://192.168.x.x/ - that should work.\nTry adding the user to the \"system default admin group\" and then see if - when trying to connect through finder - the shares for that user show up.\nI have another box running dsm 4.3 which does not seem to suffer from this issue ( also non-admin users can view the shared-folders available to them ).\nMy \"solution\" is to add admin-rights for every user ( not that I like it, but I don't have a better solution and the box is only used privately / non-commercial ).\n\nA: This is a good explanation of editing a Mac hosts file\nhttps://www.tekrevue.com/tip/edit-hosts-file-mac-os-x/\n", "Q: What is the difference between on-the-go, save episode and download episode?

The article suggests I can indeed connect more than 2 DVI or HDMI displays to it. \nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\nDisplay 1 connected via HDMI to DVI adapter (into HDMI port)\nDisplay 2 connected via (passive) Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter\n  into Thunderbolt port 1 (as in the diagram in the above article)\nDisplay 3 connected via (passive) Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter\n  into Thunderbolt port 2.\n\nOnly 2 of the monitors became active, as expected, as the article also says that only 2 displays can be used with passive adapters in the \"Can I connect a DVI display?\" section\nGiven this, I obtained some Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapters, which the article suggests are required for connecting more than 2 displays and connected them using only one of the active Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapters as follows:\n\nDisplay 1 connected via HDMI to DVI adapter (into HDMI port)\nDisplay 2 connected via (passive) Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter\n  into Thunderbolt port 1 (as in the diagram in the above article)\nDisplay 3 connected via (active) Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI\n  adapter into Thunderbolt port 2 (and its USB cable into one of the\n  USB ports).\n\nStill only 2 displays are active. I then tried all three (active) Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapters together (with the USB cable for each also plugged into a USB port) as follows:\n\nDisplay 1 connected via (active) Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI\n  adapter into Thunderbolt port 6 (as in the diagram in the above\n  article)\nDisplay 2 connected via (active) Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI\n  adapter into Thunderbolt port 1\nDisplay 3 connected via (active) Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI\n  adapter into Thunderbolt port 2\n\nStill only 2 displays are active. I then tried various combinations of all the above using different Thunderbolt and USB ports (respecting the Thunderbolt bus arrangement in the article) and different combinations of active and passive DVI adapters. Nothing seems to give me more than two displays.\nAll of the displays are fine as I've checked them individually and I've noticed that when I have 3 displays plugged in (one always inactive), if I unplug one of the active ones, the remaining inactive one will spring into life.\nHopefully someone can point out what I'm doing wrong. Or is there an issue with the current software or firmware that prevents this from working?\n\nA: After more playing around, I now have a workaround whereby using a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter instead of one of the Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapters, i.e. an analogue connection to one of the displays instead of digital, seems to work and allows me to have 3 active displays configured like so:\n\nDisplay 1 connected via HDMI to DVI adapter (into HDMI port)\nDisplay 2 connected via (passive) Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter into\n  Thunderbolt port 5 (as in the diagram in the above article)\nDisplay 3 connected via Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter into\n  Thunderbolt port 2.\n\nHowever, I was hoping to have an all-digital solution as the above Apple article suggests I can, so I'm still hoping someone will come up with a better idea!\n\nUPDATE: This appears to be an issue introduced with OS X 10.9.3. Tried an identical machine running 10.9.2 and the second configuration I tried in the original question worked just fine. Hopefully it'll be fixed in 10.9.4, until then the workaround above is still valid.\n", "Q: No covers after copying shared iTunes songs I got a new MacBook and now I would like to transfer all my media files via iTunes sharing from my old MacBook to the new one. But sometimes the covers are not copied. \nDoes someone know why and how I can copy my songs with covers?\n\nA: My experience:  there are 2 ways that itunes associates art work with songs:\n\n\n*\n\n*one is in the \"Album Artwork\" folder in itunes.  this can be updated from inside itunes in the menus.  these images stay in a folder and get some soft association with the music files.\n\n*the other method is added manually with the gui, cutting and pasting.  these get added into the mp3 file.\nit seems to me that i've tried to xfer the album artwork folder different ways before, but it doesn't work unless you copy the whole itunes setup.\n", "Q: Safari does not load any site but there is Internet connection A friend of mine asked me to help with his MacBook as Safari didn't load any site.\nI connected to his computer using TeamViewer (so internet is basically working), and then did a ping on Google.com, which worked.

These folders all live in my Completed projects folder. I am beginning to archive them into an Archived Projects folder, and I want to archive them in sub-folders by client. I always use the client name in the project folder name. For example, I have project folders named Appeal [May 2014] - Development and Identity Package [2014] - Communications. (My internal clients are department names: Academics, Communications, Development...) Here's how I want them to be archived:\nArchived Projects >> Development >> Appeal [May 2014] - Development\nArchived Projects >> Communications >> Identity Package [2014] - Communications\n\nEach project folder also has a unique set of sub-folders. I want to preserve that structure.\nMy approach\nI have been selecting one client at a time, using this script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Go to the Completed Projects folder.\n\ncd /Volumes/communications/Projects/Completed\\ Projects/\n\n# Find a folder with a specified string (e.g. \"Academics\") in its name.\n# Move (not copy) the folder to its corresponding sub-folder of the Archived Projects folder. (e.g. /Academics)\n\nfind . -type d | while read folder ; do\nif [[ \"$folder\" = *Academics* ]]; then\n    echo \"Moving $folder\";\n    mv \"$folder\" /Volumes/communications/Projects/Archived\\ Projects/Academics/;\nfi\ndone\n\nI have been calling the script like by navigating, in the Terminal, to the directory with my scripts by typing cd ~/Dropbox/scripts ↩ ./move_project_academics.sh ↩\nMy problem\nThe rudimentary pattern-matching works, but mv is throwing an error:\nmv: rename /Appeal [May 2014] - Development/SUB1/SUB2 to\n/dest/Archived Projects/Development/SUB2: No such file or directory.\n\nClearly I'm giving it the wrong set of instructions. (Although, oddly enough, this script has worked some of the time.) SUB2 does not belong in /dest/Archived Projects/Development/ at all. SUB2 should be nested inside of SUB1, which should be nested inside of the project folder. \nMy questions\nWhat shell command would move a folder and preserve its internal structure?

I reset my iPhone 4s a couple weeks ago to see if FaceTime would start working again (it didnt!). I did back it up before I reset it, but I did not import my photos to iPhoto as I always do. Is there anyway I could get those pictures back? I haven't backed up my iPhone 4s since then.\n\nA: it sounds like you have a recent backup -- so that's great news.  don't let anything over write that before you can extract your files from it.\nin this case, utilities like  will let you parse through the backup files/folders and get to the photos.  these guys have a free one i just did a quick test with, and it is simple once it reads the backups and parses through it:\nhttp://www.easeus.com/data-recovery/iphone-data-recovery/extract-iphone-data-from-itunes-backup.htm\nlet us know how it goes.\n", "Q: Why am I using LLVM? I was testing the 14.04 release of Ubuntu on VirtualBox, and later, after having gotten a pretty good idea of the changes, removed VirtualBox from my computer. However, when I ran the command 'python' in the terminal... this is what I found:\n\nWhy is it that LLVM is being used in terminal?\n\nA: When you launch python interactively, it prints its version, and the name and version of the compiler that was used to compile it.\nIn this case, Apple compiled the python executables using clang-500.0.68 (masquerading itself as GCC 4.2.1).\n", "Q: OSX Major Graphics Bug \nI was trying to use iMovie but every time it eventually does this. I used to think this was May graphics overheating (because iMovie puts my temps around 180 when running) but I saw right before it happened it seemed to be auto saving. I can't tell if it is a hardware or software issue but I hope someone can figure it out. I know that it is graphics based because if I leave the computer idle for a minute the clock starts working but as soon as I move the mouse it freezes again. This issue appears other times when I am running my computer but mostly with iMovie.\nAlso, this is the first time it's happened: When I pressed the power button the options popup appeared, I dragged it along the screen and that seemed to clear out the bug. iMovie's rendering box is pink but I was able to get my computer's info after doing this to put in this post.\nComputer Info\nMacBook Pro 13-inch, Mid 2010\n2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nUpgraded 16 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\nNVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB\nOS X 10.9.2\nUpgraded 1 TB Hybrid Drive\n\nA: Thank you for providing a picture. Unfortunately, based on the image, I can definitively tell you this is a hardware problem. Specifically, your GPU has failed. \nIf you wish to confirm this at home, you can do so by taking a screen shot the next time it occurs. If the distortion appears on your screenshot, then the problem is with your graphics processor and you to get your logic board replaced. If the distortion does not appear on the screenshot, then the issue is with your display and you need to get your display replaced. Either way, it's a hardware issue for which no online troubleshooting or solution exists*\n*As a makeshift solution to failing/failed GPUs, many users have resorted to using gfxCardStatus to force the discrete GPU off. \nBest of luck.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro External Monitor Resolution Is there a way to specify what resolution I want my external monitor to be?\nI have been looking around the internet for a few weeks, but I have not found a solution that works.\nThe native resolution of the external monitor is 1440x900, but that does not show on the list of resolutions on the list. With \"Option\" pressed when pressing \"Scaled\" the best fit I get is 1280x768. There are higher options available, but not in the 16:10 scale, so the monitor rescales them and they do not look nice.\nWhen I boot in Boot camp (Windows 8.1) Windows picks up the monitor right away, knows what resolution it should be, and sets it to 1440x900, so I do not think there is any issue with the hardware.\nThe resolution on the MacBook's monitor is 1280x800. I thought that maybe it was trying to keep the two monitors to a similar scale, so I tried setting the resolution of the external monitor with the lid closed, but the results where exactly the same.\nI don't think it is an issue with hardware (it works in Bootcamp), but basically what I have is, 13-inch MBP (mid 2012). It has the mini display port, and I am using a VGA adaptor (Monitor is VGA only).\nIs there anything else I can try, even if I need to go into a settings file and manually add possible resolutions?\n\nA: You can try Display Maestro :\n\nUnlock all display resolutions Display Maestro gives you full control\n  over attached displays, allowing the usage of all available\n  resolutions and bit depths. This is done by ignoring the operating\n  system setting of hiding potentially unsafe resolutions.\nRestore legacy depth modes It is ideal for running legacy games which\n  require 256-color mode and do not automatically switch the screen\n  depth for you. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard removed the ability to set 256\n  color mode manually using the built-in preferences pane, but the\n  feature is now available here in Display Maestro!\nLight-weight and background-friendly Display Maestro is a small\n  application which can be configured to launch during login, and sits\n  quietly in the menu bar. Upon exit, it will also automatically revert\n  your display back to the resolution chosen before it was launched.\n\n\nA: If you want your external monitor to run at its native resolution, choose Best For Display instead of Scaled.\n\nA: The problem was a cheep VGA cable.\nReplacing the cable sorted out the resolution.\n", "Q: How can I delete contacts from iCloud? After OS X 10.9.3 with the restored ability to sync contacts with iTunes (over USB) was released, I finally upgraded from Mountain Lion to Mavericks. Before I boycotted OS X 10.9 because I didn't want to give my contacts to iCloud (or any cloud, see also What's the best solution to sync contacts from Mac to Android Phone?).\nBut when I went in the iCloud settings after the upgrade, the contacts sync was active (Isn't Apple capable to migrate a simple setting like this from OS X 10.8 to 10.9? ;-)). I immediately switched it off, but I suspect that some or all of my contacts were already synced to iCloud.\nI'd like to check that no contacts are in iCloud (and delete them if some are there). What's the easiest way to do this? Just create another account, use the same Apple ID for iCloud and delete them from there?\n\nA: *\n\n*Start Contacts on your Mac and export/archive all contacts (as a backup)\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> iCloud and disable syncing of contacts (and anything else you don't want to sync to iCloud)\n\n*Log in to iCloud.com directly and delete any contacts stored there\n\n", "Q: How to prevent Matlab from GPU switching? MATLAB 2014a always uses the discrete GPU only, which is not necessary. (2013a didn't do this, therefore I think there might be an easy solution.)\nHow could I prevent this? I tried setting the NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching flag in Info.plist, but this didn't help.\nI don't want to force it using gfxcardstatus as I often work with an external monitor.\n\nA: Disable automatic graphics switching in the Energy Preferences Panel of System Preferences.

But when I try to modify and save it, I get the following error:\n\nIt's frustrating that such a basic operation has got me completely stuck.\nWhat is going wrong?\n\nA: This is happening because .scpt extension is used for compiled scripts, just use .applescript extension and it will work just file.\nYet another example of the stupid coded error messages.\n\nA: In addition to @sorin's answer, the most likely cause for this error is that you do not have permission to save scripts.\nBy default only system is allowed the create new scripts.\nThe solution is to enable write access for yourself.\nOpen Finder\nGo to folder: /Library\nRight click on the Scripts folder\n\nGet Info\nexpand v Sharing & Permissions:\n\nClick on the  lock to allow changes.\nAdd + a user (either Administrator, or your own user account)\nand give that user Read & Write permissions.\nFinally,\n\nClick on the (...)V and Apply to enclosed items...\nYou will now be able to save new scripts.\n", "Q: Outlook \"select an identity\", how to get this window? I'm familiar with the Microsoft Database Utility app / window that you can trigger by opening Outlook while holding option, like this one:\n\nHowever I received a different window this morning when opening Outlook normally, without any modifier keys.  This is the window I received this morning:\n\nDoes anyone know how to manually bring up this \"select an identity\" window?  A few of my users at work have to refer to old identities, usually archives, and I'm always hesitant to teach them how to use the MS Database Utility for fear of them rebuilding or accidentally deleting the identity.  This \"select an identity\" window seems much more user friendly.\n\nA: Yes, you can do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have Outlook open, quit out of it.\n\n*Launch the Activity Monitor.\n\n*In Activity Monitor, locate \"Microsoft Database Daemon\" and quit it.\n\n*Quit the Activity Monitor.\n\n*Open the Finder.\n\n*In the Finder, hold the Option key and select Go –> Library. This will open the hidden Library folder in your home folder.\n\n*In the Library folder, navigate to Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Preferences/Office 2011.\n\n*In that folder, find the file named \"Outlook Preferences\" and drag it to the trash.\n\n*Launch Outlook. It will now display the dialog box that allows you to choose your identity.\n\n*If you want this dialog box every time you open Outlook, make sure that \"Show this list when opening Outlook\" at the bottom of the window is selected.\n\n\nA: In my testing, the solution above works once. If you then quit Outlook and restart it, it does not bring up the dialog box, even if you checked the the Show this list every time... box. :-(\nAnother way to change identities is to option-click Outlook, then change the default identity in the database utility.

We have a variety of iOS devices (2 iPhones/3 iPads). They all backup to iCloud and have iTunes Match. Once I get a new Mac for the house, will there be any reason to register/sync these devices with iTunes on the new computer? It seems with over-the-air app and iOS updates, iCloud backup, and iTunes match there isn't a reason anymore. Am I right about this?\nThanks\n\nA: Yes you are. With iOS 7 Apple really has worked hard to make sure that iDevices were an option for people with no other \"regular\" computer. You can redownload from Apple and back up pictures to iCloud but be aware that you might want to have the ability to get the pictures off a different way (such as a upgraded Dropbox account with 100 GBs) but otherwise keeping things in e-mails and using applications with online storage you should be totally fine.\n", "Q: SATA II or III for external hard drive enclosure? I want to put the hard drive (500GB) that came with my MacBook Pro (13\" mid 2012) in an external (USB 3.0) hard drive enclosure. Are there any benefits to choosing one with the SATA III (6Gb/s) interface for this hard drive, or would SATA II (3Gb/s) work just as well?\n\nA: SATA II enclosure will work just fine. A benefit of getting the SATA III is that it will be compatible with drives you install at a later date. So if the price difference is negligible then go for III.\n", "Q: Leave iPhone on when changing SIM card I have to switch quite often between 2 SIM cards on my iPhone. I always used to turn it off to do that, however, it seems to work just fine even if I leave it on. Can it harm my iPhone or SIM card or the data on in any way by not turning it off during the procedure? \n\nA: No, this will not harm your device or SIM card. Although Apple mentions it in their manual and theoretically you can short-circuit your device (I have no clue how, but theoretically...), in practice, when done with common sense, this should not harm your device. You do need to be careful with static charges and dust.\n\nA: When I went to Italy back in March I purchased a SIM card upon arrival as the cost per minute was a little less expensive than my home network.  The agent popped the card right out and put a new one in all while the phone was powered on and there was no problem at all.  Even so I'm more comfortable powering it off to replace the SIM card and did that when I got back to the US.\n", "Q: How to add a shortcut to an individual iBook file to the iPad home screen? I'm currently in the process of creating an iBook for use within my company. Some of the people who will be using it aren't particularly tech-savvy, so I want to make it as easy as possible for them to access the iBook directly from the home screen of their iPads. I don't want them to have to worry about navigating into the iBooks app at all. Is there any way to save the individual iBook file directly to the home screen?\n\nA: *\n\n*Host your epub somewhere, preferable direct link to open the epub itself. Eg. https://epub-samples.googlecode.com/files/mymedia_lite-20130621.epub\n\n*From the address bar, select the Share icon and add it to Home Screen, rename it to your epub name.\n\n\nWhen they open the URL, they'll see options to open epub in supported app, with Open in iBooks on the right button.\nThe first time they open the epub, it'll be imported to iBooks, open them in iBooks. After that, choosing the same option will open the same epub, preventing duplicate.\n\nA: You're mostly correct but the problem is that the home screen Web Clip (aka bookmark) will forever point to the URL. The user will always get asked whether they want to open in iBooks so it's a bit of a clunky solution if you ask me. \nIf it were me, I'd be considering the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deploy the content using an MDM like Airwatch, specifically its Content Locker feature. It also manages updates to content very well. \n\n*Publish your content online (in HTML) and deploy the icon pointing to your URL as a Web Clip app.\n\n*Publish your content officially as an iBook using Apple Xcode. Pretty high end solution though and will require an Apple developer account.\n", "Q: Refresh a contact's iMessage status I've explained one of my contacts how to set his phone number as a recipient for iMessage.\nHowever, his name still appears as Text Message and not iMessage.\nHow often does iOS check if a number is an iMessage number?

If I do a search for them I can see them but I don't know where they are located. It says Desktop but my Desktop is blank. Its like I'm starting with a brand new computer and have to set everything up again.\n\nA: There was a bug in a recent iTunes update causing the Users folder to disappear.

I'm speculating that there is something happening in the headphone jack that would allow this to happen.  \nStrange is that the headphones that he is using do not have a built-in mic. – \nThank you in advance for helping me with this!\n\nA: Following your hint on Headphone jack.\nWhen using headphones only (no microphone) (the ones with the 2 black ring plug) the system activates the built in microphone.\nWhen not plugged in, the system now thinks you plugged in an external microphone and it will not activate the built in one. The reason for that would be a STUCK contact pin in the jack. \nIt is possible that the pin for the microphone got stuck.\n\n\n*\n\n*Strip down a Johnson & Johnson Q-tip & dip it in alcohol.

In Safari on Mavericks, I sometimes get a dialog from web sites indicating that some site functions will be blocked or degraded unless I turn off Private Browsing mode. Most users probably expect their choice of whether to use Private Browsing to be private. My impression is that other major browsers do not leak Private Browsing state to web sites.\nI have noticed that while in private Browsing mode, Safari will not request favicons, so in theory a site could block caching of the favicon and make a pretty good guess that Private Browsing is on.\nIn contrast, on iOS, Safari doesn't request favicons at all. But it will, even in Private Browsing mode, request any \"apple-touch-icon\" if you access the Sharing panel (the apple-touch-icon is used as the Home Screen icon if you subsequently \"Add to Home Screen\" for that URL).\nOther than favicon, are there other known ways that a web site could determine (or guess with reasonable accuracy) that you are using Private Browsing mode in desktop Safari?\n\nA: Safari’s Private Browsing doesn’t work in the same way as the other browser Private Browsing.\nFor example, Chrome’s Incognito Mode creates a separate new session that all the data will be deleted after the browsing session (the website can still track your actions from the IP address in that mode).\nWhile Safari forbid website from creating/writing a file locally, discard all the changes made to cookies, including your activities in browser during this browsing session (the website can still track your activity in this mode, except that they stored cookies in this session will be discarded).\nSo how does a website know if you’ve turned on Private Browsing? Because it checks if it can write files locally.\n\nA: On iOS, HTML5's local storage is not available in private browsing mode, which means you can detect it by attempting to save something to local storage and catching the exception with the following JavaScript:\ntry { localStorage.test = 2; } catch (e) {\n  alert('You are in Private Browsing mode');\n}\n\nModified from https://stackoverflow.com/a/17741714/\nOn OS X, there's not really a canonical method, but this should provide some useful information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can web sites detect whether you are using private browsing mode? –Security.SE\nIf you're looking for implementation guidance, you should probably try Stack Overflow instead\n", "Q: iMac will not boot An office iMac will not boot - it sits at the gray startup screen with the progress circle spinning continuously.\nI have tried:\nBooting in safe mode (same result)\nBooting in recovery mode (same result)\nChanging all peripherals (same result)\nBooting in internet recovery mode (same result)\nResetting the PRAM (worked, but same result)\nResetting the SMC (can't tell whether it worked, but same result)\nBooting with alt (Can select Macintosh HD, so that works, but still stuck following that)\nIs this certainly a hardware issue at this point, or are there more steps I can take to diagnose and deal with the problem myself?

Its purpose is to archive lots and lots of project folders. Each folder follows a prescribed nomenclature: [YYYY.MM.DD] - Medium - Client - Project name - details--details - JobNumber. For example: [2006.02.01] - Print - Development - Appeal I - Kids Art Show Insert - D0601-11. These projects are currently one folder. I want to sort them into folders by Client name. There are 7 (internal) clients, so I'm using the following shell script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Go to the Completed Projects folder.\ncd /Volumes/communications/Projects/Completed\\ Projects/\n\n# Find a folder with a specified string (e.g. \"Academics\") in its name.\n# Move (not copy) the folder to its corresponding sub-folder of the Archived Projects folder.

It would read \"Academics\" before it ever got to the conditional for the client \"Development\". As a result, it would be files into \"Academics\". And I'd have to pick it back out by hand!\nMy system's advantage\nMy colleagues and I have been scrupulous about our nomenclature (described above). I know that the Client name falls in between the 2nd and 3rd hyphens.\nMy question\nHow to leverage my system's advantage to solve my problem? I want this script to match only the part of the folder name that comes after the first two hyphens and before the third hyphen, i.e., I only want this script to search the Client \"field\" in the folder name. I keep thinking \"regular expressions\" but have no idea how to implement them. \nNote: I prefer for a solution to augment my current script, rather than replace it. I arrived at it via @patrix on this site and his idea circumvented some errors.\n\nA: How about using awk with the field separator option -F  and separate the field by the hyphen. Then get the third field.\nUPDATE \nI have updated the code to use the result returned from the awk to place the destination folder. This saves on a lot of code. And also used the separator \" - \" as Ian C pointed out in the comments. \n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Go to the Completed Projects folder.\ncd /Volumes/communications/Projects/Completed\\ Projects/\n\n# Find a folder with a specified string (e.g. \"Academics\") in its name.\n# Move (not copy) the folder to its corresponding sub-folder of the Archived Projects folder. (e.g. /Academics)\n\nfor folder in *; do\n    if [[ -d \"$folder\" ]]; then\n        thirdfield=`echo \"$folder\" | /usr/bin/awk -F ' - ' '{print $3}'`;\n        echo \"Archiving $folder to Archived Projects → $thirdfield...\";\n        mv \"$folder\" /Volumes/communications/Projects/Archived\\ Projects/\"$thirdfield\"/\"$folder\"    \n    fi     \ndone\n\nI have also added /\"$folder\" at the end of the move so the folder itself is moved. you can change this if thats not what you want by removing the \"$folder\" from the end of the mv command.\n\nYou can also cross check against an array of the 7 names so only those folders that correspond will be moved. ( you can insert an else statement where needed)\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Go to the Completed Projects folder.\ncd /Volumes/communications/Projects/Completed\\ Projects/\n\n# Find a folder with a specified string (e.g. \"Academics\") in its name.\n# Move (not copy) the folder to its corresponding sub-folder of the Archived Projects folder.

A rather simple way is to use cut to get the name of the folder\nif [[ -d \"$folder\" ]]; then\n    target=$(echo $(echo \"$folder\" | cut -d- -f 3))\n    echo \"Archiving $folder to Archived Projects → $target...\";\n    mv \"$folder\" /Volumes/communications/Projects/Archived\\ Projects/$target/\nfi\n\nThe $(echo $(echo ... )) is a lazy approach to get rid of the leading/trailing space (because cut doesn't support multi-char delimiters).\n\nIf you want to knock yourself out with sed you can use\n    target=$(echo \"$folder\" | sed -n 's/^[^\\-]*-[^\\-]*- \\([^\\-]*\\) -.*/\\1/p')\n\ninstead of cut. This only works if the target folder name doesn't contain a - itself.\n\nInstead of pattern matching you could also use a shell function to encapsulate most of the complexity.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction checkAndMove() {\n    if [[ \"$1\" == *$2* ]]; then\n        echo \"Archiving $1 to Archived Projects → $2...\";\n        mv \"$1\" /Volumes/communications/Projects/Archived\\ Projects/$2/\n    fi\n}\n\ncd /Volumes/communications/Projects/Completed\\ Projects/\n\nfor folder in *; do\n    if [[ -d \"$folder\" ]]; then\n        checkAndMove Academics\n        checkAndMove Admissions\n        ...\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nA: If you can learn bash you can certainly learn a better language like Ruby to solve this problem.\nThere is massive room for improvement in what I'm posting, but here's some basic Ruby that does your re-categorizations for you. Some advantages to this Ruby code over your bash code:\n\n\n*\n\n*It handles the addition of new client fields and automatically moves them according to your preferred archiving scheme\n\n*It makes intermediate directories if they don't exist\n\n*It halts if there's a problem moving a directory which implies that if it doesn't halt, everything moved successfully\n\n\nAnd of course, if you ask me, it's infinitely more read-able and expandable. If you can learn bash, Ruby is much of a stretch and you'll find you can automate better with it than you can with bash.\nI tried to stay close to how your bash works so it'd look familiar. As you can see, it's quite a bit terser than that bash.\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'fileutils'\n\nSOURCE = '/Users/ianc/tmp/ad'\nDESTINATION = '/Users/ianc/tmp/ad-new'\n\nDir.chdir(SOURCE)\n\nDir['**'].each do |f|\n  if File.exists?(f) && File.directory?(f)\n    # Format: [YYYY.MM.DD] - Medium - Client - Project name - details--details - JobNumber\n    date, medium, client, project, details, job_number = f.split(' - ', 6)\n    if client\n      destination = File.join(DESTINATION, client)\n      FileUtils.mkpath destination if !File.exists?(destination)\n      destination = File.join(destination, f)\n      source = File.join(SOURCE, f)\n      puts 'Moving: ' + source + ' --> ' + destination\n      FileUtils.mv(source, destination)\n    else\n      puts 'Skipping: ' + f\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n", "Q: How to: Multiple iOS Enterprise Applications inhouse I am trying to develop two separate applications for our company using the Enterprise Program.\nRegardless of what I've tried, the second app always replaces the first app...\nCreate iOS Production cert1, download, keychain, upload, Provisioning Profile 1 created.\nRepeat iOS Production cert2, download, keychain, upload, Provisioning Profile 2 created.\nI am not sure why I have gone wrong.

Only -f | -i | -n are allowed options.\nSimplest way is not to use - in a file name—it will confuse other command line programs—given that prepending - is a workaround for something else I would just not use that character.\nIf this is not an option, you can rewrite the mv commands like this\nmv ./\"$f\" \"${DIRNAME}/${FILENAME:2}\"\n\nor (a bit more generic because it then also works for absolute paths)\nmv -- \"$f\" \"${DIRNAME}/${FILENAME:2}\"\n\nAnother option (and is what I would do for any bash script longer than a few lines) is write in a scripting language like perl or python - in this case they solve the problem by their move functions not passing the filenames to mv\n", "Q: Saving to a specific path with the save prompt How do you save to specific paths with the save prompt WITHOUT navigating through the GUI?

This all worked great. Until I shut it down for a while and reconnected it recently.\nI can see the device on the network and I can open it and select a share. But when I try to mount the share, I get the following error:\n\"The operation can’t be completed because the original item for “Foo” can’t be found\"\n\nI think this is because my little NAS changed to a new IP and OS X somehow cached the original (alias?) somewhere.\nThe fact that I can successfully open these shares from another Mac, which had never seen these before, confirms that I think.\nDoes anyone know where this is potentially cached? Is there anything I can reset or throw away to get past this error?\n\nA: Ok so I am going to answer my own question. In my case the solution turned out to be really 'simple'.\nI looked at another Mac and I noticed that the /Volumes directory had different permissions. On the problematic Mac it was set to drwxr-xr-x and on a recently installed Mac it was drwxrwxr-x.\nSo I fixed my problem with:\nsudo chmod 775 /Volumes\n\n(You can also do that in the Finder of course, via Get Info)\nProblem solved. I can now mount any file share again.\n\nA: In my case (iMac trying to access files on a Win7 machine) the solution was to add permissions for \"Guest\" to the Win7 directory. This was previously not necessary. The directory was shareable to everybody and it worked. But apparently now the iMac is trying to connect as \"Guest\" and adding permissions specifically for \"Guest\" (Properties…Sharing…Share…Add…Guest) solved it.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Also for me it worked on another Mac. It turned out that I had to change the Volumes's group to admin which was wheel befor.\nSo I fixed my problem with:\nsudo chgrp admin /Volumes\n\n\nA: TL;DR - Check the permissions on your remote share, too. Make sure the Samba daemon and the AFP daemon have access to the shares.\nLong version - My issue was not with my Mac, but with the remote shares. They had 750 permissions, which seemed reasonable since I only wanted the owner and appropriate groups to get access to the folders. But the afpd (Apple File Protocol Daemon) process wasn't in the group! So it was unable to access the files. When other clients, such as my Windows machine accessed the share, they accessed it via Samba (smbd), which was running as root. Thus my Windows machine ran fine, and my Mac client seemed \"buggy\".\n$ ssh myremoteserver\n$ ps -eaf | egrep -i smbd\\|afpd \n12902 root     34784 S    smbd -D\n24642 admin    23680 S    /usr/sbin/afpd -d -F /etc/netatalk/afp.conf\n\n(So Samba's running as root, but AFP is running as \"admin\".)\n$ cd /mnt/myshares\n$ ls -l\ndrwxr-x---    6 nobody   allaccou      4096 Jun 25 02:50 foo\ndrwxr-x---   11 nobody   allaccou      4096 Jun 10 20:39 bar\ndrwxr-xr-x   12 nobody   allaccou      4096 Jun 24 23:18 baz\n\n(Here, \"baz\" works everywhere, but \"foo\" and \"bar\" only work on my Windows machine.)\n$ sudo cat /etc/group\nroot:x:0:root\nadministrators:x:1001:admin\nshare:!:1000:admin,nobody\nallaccount:!:501:bob,jane,sue\nnetdev:x:1002:\n\n(So AFP--running as admin--isn't in the group allaccount.) \nAdd him to the allaccount group and voila, a happy Mac.\n\nA: Catalina here. My wife's hard drive and her network share had the same name. This wasn't a problem with Sierra. I changed the hard drive name and boom.\nThere's a link in /Volumes with the hard drive name linking back to root. I'm guessing Catalina is case insensitive or that link to root didn't exist in Sierra.\n\nA: Aloha. I had this same issue with a shared volume on OS X Server 5.1 under OS X 10.11.4 beta. Regardless of the fact that these were beta releases, I have had this issue before. Here's how I managed to solve the problem of the \"original item\" not being found:\n\n\n*\n\n*log out of the server in Finder\n\n*Force-Quit Finder\n\n*connect again using Command-K in Finder (or, Go > Connect to Server…)\n\n*go back to the shared folder that didn't open before, and it should open fine now\n\n\nIt worked fine for me after that. Note that I do not have the Connect dialog (Command-K in Finder) ever remember my password in the Keychain since I often want to log in as different users. This also helps me troubleshoot once in a while. Also, before doing the above 4 steps, I had gone into the server and removed the shared folder from the File Sharing area and then re-added it, thinking that this would solve the problem; it did not. So therefore, I think the four steps I took (above) were the fix in my situation.\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: I found I was getting this issue as the finder app was trying to connect as guest by default.  I needed to click on the 'connect as' button on the top right.  \n\nA: I had this problem for an smb share. After checking /etc/smb.conf on the server, I hadn't added the user trying to connect from the client machine to the valid users line for that share. Once I added the user to valid users, the error resolved and I could successfully connect.\n\nA: Apparently this problem can occur for many different reasons.  In my case it was solved by re-launching the finder.  A description and solution for this was at http://www.cnet.com/news/fix-shared-computer-not-found-in-finder/ .\n\nTo fix this problem, you simply need to relaunch the Finder, and it will re-populate the list of shared devices. To do this, you can do one of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Hold the Option key and right-click the Finder icon in the Dock, then select Relaunch.\n  \n*Press Option-Command-Escape or choose Force Quit from the Apple menu, then select the Finder and click Relaunch.\n  \n*Log out and log back in to your user account.\n  \n\n\nA: I had the same problem on my MacBook Air; I could not mount shares from a mac OS X Server, when other Macs could.  \nI had to apply both the chmod and chgrp commands to fix.\nI would also recommend restarting into Recovery Mode and running repair disk and repair permissions. \n\nA: I have a Drobo 5N, and it's network name is \"Drobo5N\" - I get this error occasionally, and I have noticed that when I get the error, and I look in the Finder, my Drobo is named \"drobo5n\" (all lower-case). I have not found a way to fix this without rebooting my computer... but, I'd love to find one. (I do not have to do anything to my Drobo - just reboot my Mac.)\nAfter rebooting and running disk repair, my /Volumes ownership and permissions are (OS X 10.10.2):\n[~]$ ls -ald /Volumes/\ndrwxrwxrwt@ 5 root  admin  170 Mar 31 23:41 /Volumes/\n\nand I am currently able to mount my Drobo without any problems.\n\nA: I just had this issue running on a Macbook Air OS X 10.9.5.  The permissions were all fine.  I opened the terminal and did\n\nls -la /Volumes\n\nand got\n\nls: Photos: Invalid argument\nls: Videos: Invalid argument\n\nThese two mounts did NOT show up in Finder.  When I tried to unmount them, I get another error:\n\numount /Volumes/Videos\numount(/Volumes/Videos): Resource busy -- try 'diskutil unmount'\n\nSo then I forced an unmount:\n\ndiskutil umount force /Volumes/Videos\nUnmount successful for /Volumes/Videos\n\nOnce I removed all mounts to the network drive (there were 3 of them), I was able to go into Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server and it mounted properly.\nI am thinking the IP change may be causing this problem to crop up and for some reason the mounts are tied up and won't unmount.  At that point Finder doesn't know how to remount because the old mounts will not unmount properly.\nAt least that seems to be what my issue was.\n\nA: I'm running Yosemite latest. I ended up renaming the network share on the router, restarting the mac, and, it took a while, but I was then able to access the share under the new name.\n\nA: In my case, similar to some of the others, it was a permissions problem on the Windows 10 machine that hosted the share I was trying to access. I needed to add permissions to the files (not just the share permissions, but the actual file permissions). Specifically, I needed to either add the \"Everyone\" group as having access, or (because I didn't really want \"everyone\" to have access) the specific users I wanted to be able to access the share. \nFor the specific users, it did work to give access with the Windows Live accounts on a Windows 10 Home machine (in case anyone is thinking, as I initially was, that maybe you need local users and/or a Pro version of Win10).\n\nA: I experienced this issue shortly after upgrading to macOS Sierra and thought that perhaps permissions or something were messed up in the process. After reading through the other replies here and trying to both force restart Finder, check folder permissions, play with the network share from my router, I finally decided to re-enter the credentials (which were saved in my keychain) for the user I had been logging in as, routinely. This fixed the issue for me.\nTakeaway: Try clicking \"log in as...\" as re-entering credentials for your user, as it worked for me.\n\nA: After upgrading machines (new one running Sierra) I was setting up my standard favorites and dragging my NAS share (hosted on a Linux box) and always ended up with a \"?\" in the favorites. After trying everything in this thread, nothing worked.\nI found a different solution.\nFor reference, here's what I've always done (which stopped working as of Sierra):\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on my network share in the \"Shared\" section of the finder sidebar\n\n*Selected one of the shares in the list\n\n*Wait for it to populate in finder (without doing this, the drag operation wouldn't work)\n\n*Drag the highlighted share over to the finder sidebar.\n\n\nHere's what did work (for me):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your network share - just go look at the root directory. This gets it mounted.\n\n*In the Devices section of Finder's sidebar, click on your computer (not Macintosh HD.) You should see an entry for each drive connected to your machine, a Network entry, possibly a Remote Disc entry and of course, your share will be listed.\n\n*Drag your share from that view into the sidebar.\n\n\nA: The solution for me - provided by Synology support - was to convert the shared folder on the Synology NAS to Windows ACL:\nLog-in to DSM, Control Panel, Select shared Folder, Action, Convert to Windows ACL\n\nA: Try the following commands in terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*First disable airdrop using:\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop -bool YES\n\n\n*Then enable airdrop using:\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop -bool NO\n\n\n*Restart mac\n\nA: Not truly an answer, but rather an experienced alternative as a temporary workaround ...\nAfter many days of trial-error, research and agonizing, I concluded that my Catalina Mac-mini (as server) with Timemachine External-HD was invisible to my Mojave Macbook.  The macbook could see the files on the External-HD from Finder, etc. but Timemachine did not even see the remote External-HD.  So, I put my smaller, older WD MyPassport on my macbook as its local Timemachine.\nOnce I free up enough space to upgrade my macbook to Catalina, I will retry the remote, central server approach to my Timemachine backups.\n\nA: I would like to share following solution: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/373068/91135\n\nTurn off packet signing for SMB 2 and SMB 3 connections as described in https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205926:\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/nsmb.conf (create it if necessary)\n\n*Add\n\n\n[default]\nsigning_required=no\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save file\nReconnect SMB shares (or reboot your Mac)\n\n\nIn my case it's enough to restart finder process instead of reboot entire system.\nThis solution helps me with all my network shares, Synology NAS and another Mac in the network.\n\nA: In my case, I had set up various permissions according to my needs (users, groups, read only, read/write, etc.) but I also had on permission set to \"Everyone\":\"No Access\". I presume that this particular permission overrides any other one. As soon as I changed that one to \"Everyone\":\"Read Only\" everything worked like a charm.\n\nA: None of the existing answers worked in my situation:\n\n*\n\n*client: osx/macos 10.x (panther -> catalina)\n\n*server: debian 6 (squeeze), samba 3.5.6\n\nTurns out the share in question didn't have the correct hosts allow IP range in place to match specific host (i.e. error message is very misleading).\n\nA: For me nothing worked, So I checked my /Volumes by doing ls /Volumes and got an error.\n$ ls -la\n\nls: Foo: No such file or directory\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel  160 Jul  7 12:16 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  23 root  wheel  736 Mar 23 23:19 ..\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    1 May  5 19:59 Macintosh HD -> /\ndrwxr-xr-x@  3 root  wheel   96 Mar 23 23:18 Recovery\n\nSo, checked mount and saw that there was an entry:\n$ mount\n\n/dev/disk1s1 on / (apfs, local, read-only, journaled)\n...\n//username@IP/Foo on /Volumes/Foo (smbfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by user)\n\nSo I unmounted it:\numount /Volumes/Foo\n\nThat Fixed the problem.\n\nA: Had this same issue on a Synology NAS not being able to access specific folders. I realized that I had used one set of credentials on some shared folders, and another set of credentials on other shared folders. Once I figured that out all I had to do was:\n\n*\n\n*Locate the NAS in finder\n\n*In the upper right-corner go to \"Disconnect\"\n\n*Then click \"Connect As\"\n\n*Enter the other set of credentials\n\nI was then able to access the other folders just fine.\n\nA: OS X may have stale mount points; unmount the remote shares so that fresh mount points can take their place.  This does not happen automagically.\nThe GUI way\nTry the \"eject\" icon next to the share in finder, then wait for it to reconnect (or force it with Finder->Go->Connect to Server)\nIf that doesn't work try the commandline...\nThe command-line way\nFind the existing, probably stale, mounts with mount, then umount them like this...\n$ mount\n//GUEST:@OPENELEC._smb._tcp.local/videos on /Volumes/videos (smbfs, nodev, nosuid, noowners, mounted by user)\n$ umount /Volumes/videos\n\nNow try connecting with Finder again.\nIn my case I'm trying to connect to a remote Samba share, which has been reconfigured and restarted.\n\nA: I have had the same problem and found the source of it. When I looked at the console I would see messages from NetAuthSysAgent indicating a sandboxing problem with the sharingd process.\nI found that if I kill sharingd, OS X will restart it immediately and I am able to access the NAS shares through finder immediately without anything else needing to be done.\nSome time later the problem will return and I have will have to kill sharingd, however this is all I have to do and it's far simpler than many of the other solutions I've seen people writing about. \n\nA: This solves the error message:\n\"The operation can’t be completed because the original item for BLANK can’t be found\" \nI was able to fix this by doing the following:\n\nstarting my mac in recovery mode by holding cmd + opt + r\nselecting disk utility\nclicking mount for my SSD\nclicking first aid\nrestart my mac\n\nA: This is what fixed the issue for me:\nMake sure the domain \"local\" is included in the DNS/Search Domains settings for your network connection. That's all I had to do, in my case. See this thread for details:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8280607\n", "Q: find my iphone got lost trying to find it but i think i had find my iphone turned off in my icloud how to find my iphone 4's problem is my i cloud is on but find my iphone is turned off. iv'e been trying everthing i could think of. Need some help from the people out there that no what to do\n\nA: If you did not turn on Find My iPhone on the phone before it was lost, then I'm afraid that you can't find it using Find My iPhone.\nYou can't turn it on remotely, as this would be a huge privacy issue.\nIt's a bit like having an insurance policy - you take the hit up front (by buying the insurance, or by turning on Find My iPhone), and it pays off later (by providing coverage, or telling you where your phone is). If you don't do it up front, then you lose.\nSorry, but I don't think it's possible.\nYour best bet would be to contact law enforcement (in the case the phone was stolen), and see if there is anything they can do. If the phone was simply lost, then I am pretty sure there is nothing you can do about it, other than send it messages and hope that someone finds it and responds to the messages.\n", "Q: How to clear OSX cached applications? I'm having a very strange bug with an application. I've tried to update it but it keeps showing up the old version. I've tried deleting it too, but when I run open -a MyApplication.app it opens it again, even though I'm sure it's not anywhere. If after that I try to install again the new version, it's still showing the old one.\nSo I assume OSX is caching it somewhere. Does anybody know where this cache is or how to clear it?\n\nA: I had the same issue once. I solved it by running AppFresh and scan to check if all apps are updated. When you find the one that gives you trouble, you can right-click and choose Reveal in Finder, and delete it.\n\nA: As to where it is...\nThe few times I used Time Machine it would find multiple copies of apps, upon closer inspection those apps were on the Time Machine volume. Do you have one of those hooked up?\n", "Q: Double Apple iD? My brother in law has a iPhone 4 i gave to him. I wiped the phone using the restore function in iTunes, and activated by restoring HIS backup form a iPhone 3Gs using my computer.\nAll is fine, all app updates are running ok on my brother-in-laws Apple-Id. Only if there is an iOS update the darn phone asks for the password linked to MY Apple-Id. Probably has to do something with the fact i used MY computer to activate the phone, and restored the backup i pulled from his 3Gs.\nHow do i remove MY Id from his phone?\n\nA: If it's asking for your Apple ID to update an app, then the app has been purchased on your account. You can't change the Apple ID that an app has been purchased with—instead, delete the app from the device and purchase it again with the Apple ID that you want the app registered to.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a new user account on your computer\n\n*Open iTunes, and sign in with his AppleID\n\n*Perform a backup (make sure to transfer all purchases)\n\n*Wipe the device again, and this time activate it with his AppleID\n\n*Restore as normal\n\n\nThis is technically overkill, but will resolve the issue with a lot less headache.\nIf he has any applications that were purchased under your AppleID, they will show up when Transferring Purchases; do not transfer them, and repurchase each one under his account. Watch out also for audiobooks and movies.\n", "Q: Any point in waiting for Samsung 850 EVO? I'm about to upgrade my MacBook Pro (13\" mid 2012) with 16GB of RAM and an SSD. According to this news article Samsung's new 850 SSD series might be around the corner, and I'd much appreciate your opinion on whether I should wait for it or go with the current 840 EVO?\nIs there really any more speed to be had over the MBP's SATA III interface than what the 840 EVO already delivers? The fact that the 850 series will still use SATA III would suggest so, but on the other hand this post doesn't think so.\n\nA: Ask yourself this, do you need a performance boost now or can you wait an unknown amount of time for a possibly unnoticeable difference between the 840 and 850 EVO?\nI personally have an 840 EVO, install them all day long and before my EVO I had an Intel SSD. EVOs are great but the decision should be as simple as do you want it now or do it you want it later.

The machine I have is at OS 10.9.2 and I installed Eclipse fine.  But when I try to use the Java extensions it says I cannot access the package in the JDK.\nThis is related to a programming question I have over on stack overflow:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/23810403/how-do-i-make-use-of-the-apple-extensions-for-java-using-eclipse/23814735?noredirect=1#comment36639985_23814735\nBut what I need to know now is how to get the Mac / Java / Eclipse to cooperate.  I have answers for the programming side of it but the answerer is using 10.8 and I am using 10.9 and it looks like we have things setup the same - from what we have compared.\nWhat am I missing?  Is there some other configuration change that needs to be made?  Will this work with 10.9 and Java 1.6?  Like I said I am a total newbie and I know that Apple has made changes regarding their support of Java I just don't know if that is a factor here or not.\n\nA: This turns out to be an Eclipse configuration issue not an Mac configuration issue.\nUnder the build path the jvm has access rules that forbid the use of the com.apple package and sub packages.

Can I still recover my recent photos? I accidentally clicked \"restore backup\" on iTunes when suddenly all my latest photos were deleted instead my past and deleted photos and videos were restored back and I wasn't able to backup my latest photos. \nCan I recover my latest photos?\n\nA: Your photos are probably gone from your phone, but there are a couple other places to check.\nWere you backing up to iCloud? If so, you may be able to restore a backup from iCloud to your phone and with it your camera roll. Apple KB article PH12521.\nWere you syncing your photostream to iCloud? If so, fire up iPhoto or the windows iCloud tool and download the photos. Apple KB article PH13693.\n\nA: Yes Yen, whenever you sync, update or restore your iPhone, the first thing iTunes does is create a backup file. This contains settings, SMS, camera roll etc - pretty much everything except media and apps. You should be able to choose the backup date/time you want to restore from in iTunes if there's a previous backup that will have more of your content.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but it comes up pretty high on search results for this topic.\nMost of the time, iTunes initiates a secondary backup prior to restoring a backup (presumably for situations just like the question presents.) If you perform an accidental restore:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the iTunes preferences from the menu. On Mac, Preferences is in the iTunes menu.

I recently received a dialog box on my MacBook Air (10.9.2 Client) asking \"Do you want the application “ntpd” to accept incoming network connections?\". I have OS X's firewall enabled.\nNow, my understanding is that ntpd on OS X Client is only for setting local machine time from a remote NTP server.

In general, I would like to know if there are any discrepancies between the MacPorts coreutils and the GNU coreutils, and how I might go about answering this question myself. In particular, I don't understand why the su command (or the gsu command, since all of the MacPorts coreutils applications also seem to come prefixed with a 'g') doesn't seem to be included by MacPorts.\nFirst, I check that I have the coreutils package installed:\n$ port installed coreutils\nThe following ports are currently installed:\n  coreutils @8.22_0 (active)\n\n$ port info coreutils\ncoreutils @8.22 (sysutils)\nVariants:             universal\n\nDescription:          The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell, and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating\n                      system. These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system. Previously\n                      these utilities were offered as three individual sets of GNU utilities, fileutils, shellutils, and\n                      textutils. Those three have been combined into a single set of utilities called the coreutils.\nHomepage:             http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/\n\n[...]\n\nSo far so good. Then I look for instances of su and gsu on my path:\n$ which -a su gsu; \n/usr/bin/su\n\nNothing; the GNU su isn't there. As a sanity check, I look for some other coreutils applications, e.g. rm:\nwhich -a rm grm\n/opt/local/libexec/gnubin/rm\n/bin/rm\n/opt/local/bin/grm\n\nIt looks like the directories to check are /opt/local/bin and /opt/local/libexec/gnubin, so I look there:\n$ ls -1 /opt/local/bin /opt/local/libexec/gnubin | grep -x 'su\\|gsu'\n\nAgain, nothing. Now, this is almost certainly redundant, but I also try looking with the port contents command:\n$ port contents coreutils | grep -x \".*su\"\n\nNothing. Am I certain that su is included in GNU coreutils? No, I guess not. So I check here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities#Programs_included_in_coreutils\nIt looks like it is; it's listed under the Shell Utililites header.

I want to use CapsLock as a modifier key to type symbols like ({\\})= using the alphabetical keys in the keyboard. \nFor example:\nCapsLock+a is mapped to =\nCapsLock+k is mapped to \\\n\nTo do this, I mapped CapsLock to Option+Shift using Keyremap4Macbook following the instructions in \"A Useful Capslock Key\".\n<item>\n    <name>F19 to F19</name>\n    <appendix>(F19 (capslock) to (shift+opt))</appendix>\n    <identifier>private.f192f19_escape</identifier>\n    <not>VIRTUALMACHINE</not>\n    <autogen>\n        --KeyOverlaidModifier--\n        KeyCode::F19,\n        KeyCode::OPTION_L,\n        ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,\n    </autogen>\n</item>\n\nNote that, before that I mapped CapsLock to key code 80 in PcKeyboardHack which is key code of F19. \nThen I mapped key combinations of CapsLock + alphabetical characters to symbols such as =\\})( using Ukelele.\nSo far, everything works properly except that there is a side effect of this setup: I cannot use Alt+Shift modifier for any other key binding. This is pretty restrictive compromise. \nI tried mapping CapsLock to more complex key bindings such as Ctrl+Shift+Alt or Cmd+Shift+Alt or Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+Alt. But these didn't work well because then mapping CapsLock+alphabetical keys in Ukelele changes the alphabetical keys too. For example, assume that Ctrl+Shift+Alt+a is mapped to =. Then a alone is mapped to = as well. \nI wonder if this problem can be solved somehow? I think there might be two alternative paths to look for solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a new custom modifier key for CapsLock without consuming existing modifier keys such as Alt+Shift.\n\n*Preventing the mapping of Ctrl+Shift+Alt+a to change the a key all together.\n\n\nAre these solutions possible to implement?\n\nA: Got this all from more recent Brett Terpstra posts, so full credit to him.\nUsing Karabiner Elements and BetterTouchTool, you can create a \"Hyper\" key mapped to control-option-shift-command (which probably won't be used by any apps as a default modifier). Then you can use BetterTouchTool to maps Cap Locks + \"a\" to type \"=\". Typing \"a\" by itself still gets the letter \"a\". You can also set it up that tapping Cap Locks alone functions as the escape key or even as standard Caps Lock.\nRather than reposting Brett's code here, I'll link to the post: A Hyper Key with Karabiner Elements, full instructions.\nSome screenshots to help guide you along:\n\nAfter adding Brett's code to karabiner.json, the Complex Modifications pane will look like so. No need to do anything else here.\n\nIn BetterTouchTool, switch to the Keyboard pane, add a shortcut, type Caps Lock + character, then choose \"Insert/Type/Paste Custom Text\" as the Trigger Predefined Action.\n\nIn the Insert/Type/Paste Custom Text sheet, type the character(s) you want and choose \"Insert Text by Typing\".\n", "Q: External USB3.0 4TB HDD is not recognized by Mac OS X I've bought an external 4TB HDD.

In MS Office 2011 for Mac, there is a useful menu option under:\nFile > Share > Email (as Attachment)...\nIt's a very quick way to get from editing to email.  Is there a way to assign this to a keyboard shortcut? I'd be be glad if I can do this with the already-installed tools, but would consider a third party tool as well.  \nWhat I have tried:  Word's own keyboard tool under \"Tools > Customize Keyboard...\"  I can find no listing of this menu item (under 'file' 'share' or 'email').\nNor does the OSX (Mountain Lion) Keyboard Shortcuts preferences tool help.  I've tried a shortcut for both \"Share\" and \"E-mail (as Attachment)\".  The first one shows up in the MS Word \"File\" Menu, but does nothing in practice except blink the menu header.  The second one simply does nothing. \n\nIs there a way to set up a keyboard shortcut for this option?  If not, do you have any other quick solution for achieving the same effect?  These are often files that I receive via email, so I'd rather not have to explicitly save them, note the location, then attach them from within an email program.  I want a quick edit & send.  The copy n my outbox is enough of a backup for me.\n\nA: You have to type the exact menu item name in the shortcut area, so make sure that you have the ellipsis: \"E-mail (as Attachment)…\"\nYou can type an ellipsis character by holding down option and typing ;\n", "Q: How to select the text in the address bar while browsing Google search results in Safari I don't know why Safari 7 doesn't allow me to select the text in the address bar in one step while browsing google search results.\nIn other sites I just have to click once on the address bar and that's it, the whole text is selected.\nGoogle search results instead makes Safari to put the caret in the address bar but won't select the text, also double-clicking (or clicking N times) won't select the text either, what I have to do is click once, wait and triple-click to select the whole text.\n\nA: You can try using the shortcut: ⌘ + l.\n\nA: Click on the favicon in the address bar (small image at left-hand side).

It does not start up, it hangs at wether a pure white background or white with the Apple logo. I tried to go into disk utility but pressing the option key does not lead anywhere, I do not get to the point where I can choose wether to boot the system or open the disk utility. What can I do? Can I somehow use my other Mac to save the HD of the MacBook Air? How can I install the system fresh? Can I access disk utility somehow using my other Mac?\n\nA: Did you try to boot with cmd+R pressed, to boot from the recovery partition? See this link for details. From here it seems that your MBA does not find a valid OS to continue booting. If the local recovery system is not available, you need a working Internet connection for booting an online version of the recovery system. While in the recovery system, you can troubleshoot the installed system and re-install it, if necessary. \n\nA: I don't know if you've resolved your problem yet but I was getting the same error message when trying to format a 1T external drive.\nDid some research today and after about 20 different suggestions I tried a few with no joy.  Finally tried the simplest method that most users said didn't work; use a bootable USB flash installer if you've made one.  Using the recovery partition doesn't work for a lot of people.\nAlso, how old is your Air?  Did it come pre-installed with Mavericks or did you upgrade from ML?  If you upgraded simply re-download Mavericks from the App store (free).  If Mavericks came already installed then you'll have to use the disc that came with it.  Although another option would be to use your other Mac to re-download Mavericks then simply copy the installer to the Air, putting it into your applications folder (but don't run it).  You can now make your bootable backup.\nAnyway, I'm an upgrade from ML so I re-downloaded the Mavericks installer and here's the very short version of how it works.\n\n\n*\n\n*After downloading Mavericks do NOT install.  If it begins automatically simply cancel.  You want the installer unused and located in your applications folder.\n\n*Make a bootable backup on a 16GB flash drive\n\n*When finished, shut down computer.\n\n*Insert USB flash drive.\n\n*Restart computer and hold down the \"Option\" key as it goes through the boot process.\n\n*You'll be given an option to select a boot drive/partition.  Select the USB drive and let it do it's thing.\n\n*A few choices will come up in a moment.  Select \"Disk Utility\", the drive will be present and you can now perform whatever functions you need.\n\n*When finished, reboot in normal mode from you Air and you're problem should be fixed.\nIf you don't know how to make a bootable USB flash drive, do a quick search.  You'll get plenty of hits and most all of them have the same basic and very easy instructions.  I actually installed the entire Mavericks OS on the flash drive but for reasons not relevant to your question.  If it doesn't work or disk utility is unable to fix your problem then I'd definitely do the fresh install (if you have your data backed up.\nThis is actually one of the reasons I installed the whole OS on the flash drive.\nGood luck.  If anything I said is not something you're capable of doing then we'll try something else.\n", "Q: mac book pro start crashing my Mac Book Pro 17' was bought in 2012 Jan. so probably it's out of warranty already.\nNow it start crashing occasionally.\nsometimes it just freezes, the screen has no response. sometimes the screen becomes white. \nThen I'll hold the power button a few seconds so it shuts off. then press it again so it restarts. but sometimes it even freezes during restarting.\nI suspect there's some hard disk issue. however a quick scan using \"disk utilities -> verify\" doesn't flag any error.\nany suggestion?\nthe os is Mac OS X version 10.7.5. shall i update it?\nis there any other disk \"deeper\" scan tools?\n\nA: When booting try holding down the four chord Command-Option-P-R and keep it held down through at least three reboot cycles, there will be a chime for each one; that often helps high-level hardware issues.\nNext, boot and hold down the left Shift key as it comes up.  This will bring up the system in Safe mode. Take note, this can be very slow, as the cache isn't used; this helps when something in your cache has been corrupted.\nWhen using Disk Utility, make sure that you check both the disk (which does the structure and partitions) as well as the volumes under it (where the data is stored); do permissions as well. This should take a few minutes.\nFor diagnostic information, hold down Command-V (verbose), and a Unix-like log will scroll by. If it freezes, the last few lines should be useful in diagnosing.\nWanted to make sure that I understood you correctly, that you're seeing just a white screen at boot -- if so, the above should help glean some information. If you're going along and the screen turns white with a multi-lingual error message, that's the \"white screen of death\" and appears when there's a hardware problem. This can be an obnoxious USB device that isn't behaving, the wrong kind of memory was installed, failure on the motherboard, etc.\nMost of the Mac problems I'm aware of have been when someone tries to save a few bucks in upgrading their memory. It's a complicated subject, but when RAM has to internally be refreshed on a clock cycle, it matters which part of the clock cycle that happens on. It appears that PCs and MACs do things slightly differently, and from what I've seen most marketing information the two products look identical. Carefully scrutinizing the hardware of the two products shows there is a difference.\nI agree this sounds like a RAM issue. You might want to swap in some memory from a friend's machine and see if the problem goes away. Optionally, the recommended course of action is to use just the memory Apple supplied, see if this solves the problem, and if so, go to Crucial.com and use their tools to see exactly what's needed.\n\nA: This smells like a hardware issue, probably RAM not working properly. I would not expect that an OS upgrade helps, but what you might want to try is a freshly installed OS from your installation media on an external disk.\nIn older Macs, RAM modules could have been shaken loose - in an MBA they are soldered in place. If it really has to do with RAM, I am afraid this looks like a motherboard swap at an Apple certified repair shop.\nI guess you will need to try out things and watch if the issue goes away (or gets worse). \n\nA: If you computer is still operational (sometimes) then open the Console in the Utility folder.\nIn there type I/O in the filter window, while in all messages (on the left).\nThat will tell you if you actually have disk problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do have them (the I/O's) you can use the fsck -f in the Terminal application.\n\n\nThat is Apple way of attempting to repair the disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do not have the I/O in the console report, try using Apple Hardware test. pres D during start up to check the rest of your hardware.\n\n*If Hardware test shows no problems, lets eliminate Software problems. To do that Start in Safe mode. Press Shift during start up.\nBest would be if you could publish some 30 lines from the Console here (remember the time of the crash event), so we can take look.\nWe do not need the complete console report after your Mac has started again, only the part around the time stamp when it locked down.\n", "Q: Receive StackExchange notifications Is there a way to receive notifications from StackExchange sites in the Notification Center in OSX?\n\nA: I'm not sure why MacLemon didn't post SENotifier as a proper answer, but that's your best choice right now. Version 1.1 added the ability to send notifications about your Stack Exchange to Notification Centre.\n\n\nSENotifier is a Mac OS X app that shows the current contents of your\n  Stack Exchange inbox in the menu bar and was inspired by Gmail\n  Notifier.\nI created this app so the inbox notifier would be visible all the\n  time, instead of only when a Stack Exchange page was loaded in the\n  browser.\nThis app uses the new Stack Exchange API v2.0 with authentication, so\n  it can get the current contents of your inbox.\n\n\nA: Any app can send notifications in Notification Center, though I'm not sure Stack Exchange has an OS X app to send notifications from, Apple's Mail.app can do it. Go into System Preferences, and to the Notification Center Preference Pane located in the Personal section, and add Mail to the Notification Center. Now, whenever you receive a notification from Stack Exchange via email, you will be notified in Notification Center.\n", "Q: mail app not sending appropriate Reply To addresses from different email accounts My wife has a MacBook Pro (10.8.2) with a Telus home internet connection. She uses the Mac mail app (6.2) and her primary email account is a Gmail address, which she has been using with no problem (using Gmail's imap and smtp servers).\nShe recently asked me to set up another Gmail account, which I did, but whenever she sends a new email, the Reply To address is for her original account.

I see some articles on sharing Internet from laptop to device WHEN laptop is connected to LAN, but here my laptop is connected ti WIFI.\nPlease guide me on this. Links to articles will be fine.\nThank you.\n\nA: You cannot do that, because the WiFi card cannot be connected to another WiFi spot as broadcasting his own signal. If you want to become a wireless hotspot, you'll loose connectivity with the internet. Therefor you'll need to be connected to internet with LAN. To do what you want, you'll need an external WiFi card.\n", "Q: Create a service using Automator to compile .tex file in Mac I'm using Mac OS X 10.9.3, TeXLive-2013 and Scrivener to write my papers.\nI'd like to use Apple's Automator in order to create a service (available from the Finder's right-click menu over a file) called \"Compile TeX file\" that runs a simple command using the selected file as an input.\nExample:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside a folder (/Volumes/Data/TeX_docs/) I've an exemple.tex file created by Scrivener that is ready for compiling with LaTeX.\n\n*I'd like to right click this file and from the Finder's Service menu choose the option \"Compile TeX file\"\n\n*Once chosen, this service will execute the command latexmk -pdf -bibtex exemple.tex and so compile the .tex file inside the same folder, creating a .pdf file (This Terminal command is working perfectly right now, so the need to automate this action!)\n\n*After compiling the .tex file, a dialog box appears and asks if I want to delete all the temporary files with a Yes or No option.

The phone had limited apps, several disabled settings, and no icon for the App Store among its restrictions. The device Restrictions feature in Settings was set to Off (it was not being used). The iPhone was essentially set up to serve as a tool for affiliates to use in their work and nothing more.\nHow can a company that wants to provide employees or affiliates with iPhones strictly for limited business work set similar restrictions as those set by the startup? Are there specific tools available to make this happen short of compromising the device's security settings?\nRelated: As part of your answer, please feel free to comment on similarities and differences to Android devices if you have a broad knowledge of this topic.\n\nA: Apple Configurator can be used to configure devices in various ways including restricting apps, features and connectivity.\nPayloads can be configured in these profiles that customise the device in various ways, such as pre-configuring certain settings or restricting functionality.\n\nThese profiles are by default able to be removed at any time, however they can be set to only allow removal with authorisation, or never.\n\nThese .mobileconfig files can be installed on a device simply by downloading them through Safari, or can be installed over USB to the device.\n\nA: The iPhone was setup and restricted with a mobile device manager (MDM for short.)\nApple Configurator is designed to do just what you experienced.

I worked with a manufacturer to create a grounded, 3-prong Apple duckhead for the US. It is now available on Amazon.\n\n\n\nA: I have only just discovered this problem with a 2017 MacBook Pro. I get a tingling feeling from the MacBook and realised that the earth part of the apple UK 13 amp plug is a dummy (not connected with the circular locking spur on the charger unit) but I noticed on my early MacBook Air that there was an earth connector on the apple plug and so I swapped it and now I do not have the tingling problem. I do have it on the Air with the new \"improved\" apple plug.\n\nA: The AC cable is grounded up to the Power supply connection.\nThe 3 pin grounded cable goes to a 2 pin connector which then plugs into the adapter.\nThis means that the grounding is not even connected so there is absolutely no difference safety-wise. \nMain reason is for those places where you have to rotate the wall plug to insert, or you need to insert a grounding pin into the plug to activate.\nThere is no grounding on the output site of the power adapter, thus your Mac is not grounded.\n\nA: Some types of 3 pin prong are not indeed grounding. The link mainly teaches how to ground it DIY. But it needs some tools and skill that it's not easy to DIY.\nThen, I tried to ground it with a little piece of tin foil, a scissor and some band to stick the tin foil which is attached to the grounding pin.

I've been having this problem with my Matrox DualHead2Go ME and my late 2011 15\" MBP (running 10.9.2). When the displays wake from sleep, the external monitor does not re-awake.\nI've gathered that this is because the Matrox unit goes into its own sleep mode and is not re-awoken by the OS's wake signal.\nWhat does work is unplugging and plugging back in the thunderbolt cable my Matrox is connected with. This is less than ideal, however, as I worry about wear and tear from plugging/unplugging the cable multiple times a day.\nIs there any way I could toggle my thunderbolt drive on and off from the terminal to avoid the constant plugging/unplugging of the thunderbolt cable?\n\nA: Apple has several kexts for the Thunderbolt-Connection :\nAppleThunderboltDPAdapters.kext \nAppleThunderboltEDMService.kext\nAppleThunderboltIP.kext\nAppleThunderboltNHI.kext\nAppleThunderboltPCIAdapters.kext\nAppleThunderboltUTDM.kext\nIOThunderboltFamily.kext \nI think the commands you are looking for are either:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltPCIAdapters.kext\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltPCIAdapters.kext\n\nor\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOThunderboltFamily.kext    \nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/IOThunderboltFamily.kext\n\nI have a Thunderbolt port in my Mac Pro, but currently no devices. So I can't tell you exactly which kext does the trick.\n--\nFurther Information :\nThunderbolt is basically PCIe tunneled through the DisplayPort Connection. I can imagine that it is based on the ACPIPlatform or IOPCIFamily kernel extension. Either way if you unload those you would probably cut off the branch you're sitting on.\nApple released a document on creating Thunderbolt drivers and how you verify if the device is still online here.\nIt also says: \"In the case of PCI, the I/O PCI family (IOPCIFamily) within the I/O Kit is responsible for enumerating the PCI bridge in the controller chip and any downstream bridges or devices.\"\nFurthermore : \"PCI device drivers can determine if a Thunderbolt device is connected by recursively searching over parents in the I/O Registry for the key IOPCITunnelled (...).\"\nAlso have a look into the Developer Library.\nThunderbolt is a complicated technology and you could either write a little program or you can write a launch script that checks and reloads the driver if the device is offline. You could do it manually instead of unplugging it and replugging it in.\n\nA: The Hackint0sh Community has generously created some kext management tools for everyone to use, even those that own and operate a bone fide, genuine Macintosh. \n\n\n*\n\n*SRTools - (check out the video demo!)\n\n*Kext Utility\n\n*Kext Wizard\nYou can use these tools to experiment and quickly discover exactly what will work for you.

You see... userland is userland, and kernel space is kernel space, and never the twain shall meet, except on the wikipedia page.\nThe idea here, and what these tools are used for, is to experiment. In the Finder, under the Go menu, select \"Go to Folder...\" or type ⇪\nshift-⌘\ncommand-g and type /System/Library/Extensions in the address field that appears, and in the window that opens, look for extensions with \"thunderbolt\" in the filename. Use one of the above linked utilities to test your set up with unloading and loading the various kexts, to see which one, if there is indeed one, that will reveal itself as the one you need. Then you can streamline the process later (such as with a very simple bash script that has been appified to unload/reload a kext).\nA great resource for discovering how to customize your particular set up is to browse through the Developer Library, and, of course, wikipedia is quite often essential for discovery, and at times, gleaming understanding. \n\nA: Ok Guys So Here’s the FIX with BIG SUR\nI did few modifications with whatever was available on internet to solve this problem\nStep 6 & 7 are few modifications which I did.\nHere it goes\nReboot in recovery mode (CMD+R)\n\n*\n\n*Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*csrutil disable\n\n*csrutil authenticated-root disable\n\n*mount - uw /Volumes/Macos (Enter WHATEVER YOUR MACOS DRIVE NAME IS, my macOS drive name is Macos)\n\n*cd /Volumes/Macos (Enter WHATEVER YOUR MACOS DRIVE NAME IS, my macOS drive name is Macos)/System/Library/Extensions\n\n*rm -rf AppleThunderboltNHI.kext\n\n*rm -rf /System/Library/Caches/*\n\n*Kmutil install -u --force --volume-root /Volumes/Macos (Enter WHATEVER YOUR MACOS DRIVE NAME IS, my macOS drive name is Macos)/System/Library/Extensions\n\n*bless -folder /Volumes/Macos(Enter WHATEVER YOUR MACOS DRIVE NAME IS, my macOS drive name is Macos)/System/Library/CoreServices —bootefi --create-snapshot\nFORGET THE PROBLEM :-D\nYou’ll need to perform these steps every time you update Big sur with their security updates n all.\nNo need to enable SIP\nHave a good life :-)\n\n", "Q: What's going wrong with context menu's Save Attachment in Apple email Apple email will Save Attachments to a folder of my choice, when I use File / Save Attachments from the menu at the top of its window.

Which parts (if any) in Macbook Air 13\" mid-2011 can be upgraded to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*an original part from a later version of Macbook Air/Pro\n\n*or a third-party component which has a better performance/extra features?\n\n\nWhich are those replacement work really well (eg with no compatibility problems; last at least as long as the originals etc)?\nE.g.: CPU, SSD, RAM, main board, wifi/BT card, speakers, USB 3.0, camera etc.\n\nA: Here is what I found so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*wifi: upgradable to 802.11 AC, with third-party QuickerTek QCard2 (manufacturer gives dimensions: V1= 18.07mm x 39.9mm, but contradicting answers on whether it's compatible with MBA2011 13\"). I asked for feedback on it in a separate question; haven't tried it myself yet)\n\n\nA: You can also upgrade upgrade the SSD.\nBut be careful the connector used is a variant of the mini PCI Express connector. \nWith the Airport card it is the only removable component (worth changing) of the Macbook Air. \n\nA: You can replace the SSD with another (faster or larger, or both) third-party SSD. Be aware that the SSD is not a regular SATA SSD, it is a mini-PCIe interface. There are several models here (OWC)\nFrom earlier answers, it looks like you might be able to change the Airport card.\nAnd that's pretty much it. Definitely can't change the RAM or CPU, or upgrade the battery, and there is no optical drive to do anything with.\n", "Q: Will one get in trouble for taking a jailbroken device through airport security? My brother is worried that he may get in trouble if the people checking bags at security can see his jailbroken device when he enters the US. \nAre there any documented cases or specific experiences with this where people got into trouble due to a jailbreak modification?\n\nA: From me, a US citizen, I wouldn't worry about it at all.\nThey shouldn't even touch his iPhone/iPod, let alone turn it on. Also, I can't imagine how he could get in trouble over something that is legal in the US (jailbreaking). \nFrom my experience flying, electronics are just sent through an xray machine. Any search of electronics would make people upset on grounds of the 4th amendment.\n\nA: I work for the TSA and no, we cannot see that the device is jailbroken, nor do we care that it is jailbroken...\n\nA: In 10 years of flying with some form of smartphone, never once, in any country, including US, has any form of security paid any attention to any device I carried. \nIf you are concerned, my suggestion is to enable the lock code, lock your phone, and then forget about it. They can't open your phone to look for whatever evidence you think is there.\n\nA: As bassplayer said, Jailbreaking is legal in the US (with the exception of the iPad, where the law is rather fuzzy). You should have nothing to worry about. \n\nA: According to: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking\nJailbreaking is legal in USA, unlocking is NOT. But you have to check if it is illegal to jailbreak in  the country you are going.\n\nA: I've been through airports a few times, always with my iPhone which has always been jailbroken. Nothing's ever happened—it's just a phone and they consider it as such, never even turning the thing on.\nThese have been return flights from UK to Italy\n\nOf course, paranoia can always mean you can hide Cydia or even disable Substrate to remove all tweaks so that the device looks fine, without having to remove the jailbreak.\n", "Q: How do I vary the repeat an alert in say 2 hours then 30 min. then 5 min.? Before Mavericks, I would respond to Alerts (was Alarms) to repeat in 2 hours, 5 min., 1 day, 1 day before event starts, etc., and when, for example, an alert repeats after 2 hours, I can then change the next repeat to 5 minutes...\nSnooze-ing every 15 min. doesn't work (and gets very annoying): is this the 3rd or 6th snooze?\nI don't want to have to create a new event each time an alert occurs. How do I vary the repeat?\n\nA: You should be able to click and hold the snooze button for a drop down list of available snooze times. \n", "Q: How to reset trackpad after pinch to zoom stops working It seems like whenever I use a device that's not made by Apple (USB mouse, bluetooth speakers) invariably the pinch to zoom and rotate features on the Magic Trackpad will stop working after awhile in all apps. I tried to disconnect and re pair trackpad, disable and enable the features in settings, close all apps. The only thing that will make pinch to zoom come back is resetting the computer.\nIs there any other way (terminal, etc) to make the trackpad work correctly without resetting the computer? I really dislike ruining my uptime.\nThis is on a recent iMac with Magic Mouse, Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad on OS X 10.9.3.\n\nA: Go into the trackpad settings in System Preferences and uncheck every single checkbox in all the tabs (pinch to zoom etc. etc.) , wait 5 seconds and recheck all the box you use.

The shortcut to put a screenshot on the desktop is just Command + Shift + 4 (or 3).  Don't press the control key; when you do, it copies to the clipboard instead.  That's why you're not getting a file on the desktop.\n\nA: Same problem here: I couldn't see the screenshots on the Desktop anymore (also, I couldn't see them when I viewed the ~/Desktop directory in the finder. However, I checked the ~/Desktop via the Terminal app, and everything was there (indicating that I used the correct keys).\n\nThe simplest solution actually helped: I just relaunched the Finder and everything went back to normal!\n\n\nA: You did all correct but missed the last line after changing the location.\nTo have the changes take effect, you then must type:\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\n\nA: On my machine this happened (OS 10.9.5) I just had to restart (not reboot) and the desktop-save was restored.  Better than that: the images that I thought hadn't been saved appeared as they should have.\n\nA: As Mark had answered, the issue with the screenshots not saving to the desktop is that the OP was using the wrong keyboard shortcut.   Command + CTRL + Shift + 4 does not save to the desktop... instead it saves to the clipboard.\nA complete reference of screenshot commands is below, for those interested:\nSaving to the desktop\nCommand-Shift-3: Take a screenshot of the screen, and save it as a file on the desktop\nCommand-Shift-4, then select an area: Take a screenshot of an area and save it as a file on the desktop\nCommand-Shift-4, then Space, then click a window: Take a screenshot of a window and save it as a file on the desktop\nSaving to the clipboard\nCommand-Control-Shift-3: Take a screenshot of the screen, and save it to the clipboard\nCommand-Control-Shift-4, then select an area: Take a screenshot of an area and save it to the clipboard\nCommand-Control-Shift-4, then Space, then click a window: Take a screenshot of a window and save it to the clipboard\n\nA: None of the previous answers worked for me but, with Mojave, this one did the trick.\nInstead of doing Command+Shift+3:\n\n\n*\n\n*perform Command+Shift+5\n\n*In the Options, make sure \"Desktop\" or \"Other Location\" is selected\n\n*Also make sure that \"Remmember Last Selection\" is checked\n\n*Perform a \"Capture\"\n\n\nThen, next time you will do Command+Shift+3, it should be working.\n\nA: Go to the DropBox Preferences and \"unmark\" 'Share screenshots using Dropbox'\n\n\nA: I actually just got this problem, it was caused by my Desktop being locked for some reason. It may be worth checking whether that is the case.\nMore broadly, you can view your Mac's screenshot logs by launching the Console. The process you're looking for is screencaptureui. For me, with this error, I got a message:\nerror   07:34:49.747167 -0400   screencaptureui Failed to write screenshot to /Users/ifly6/Desktop//Screen Shot 2019-09-10 at 07.34.47.png. You don’t have permission to save the file “.Screen Shot 2019-09-10 at 07.34.47.png” in the folder “Desktop”.\n\n\nA: Simply\nCMD + SHIFT + 5 to pop the config bar.\nClick Options and Make sure you have selected Save to Desktop or whatever you want to do every time you press CMD + SHIFT + 3\nNow, some short explanation:\nFor my scenario, I use Quicktime a lot to record screen. Since macOS Catalina, Quicktime toolbar changed and somehow that same toolbar controls you screen-capture shortcut behavior. However, when you CMD + SHIFT + 5, that bar keeps its own configuration separate from Quicktime's.\n\nA: At lease on Mac Yosemite, if you have Dropbox installed, this is a default setting in Dropbox. You can select if you want the older \"put the screenshot on the desktop\" method, or if you want to integrate your screenshots with Dropbox. \nGo to Dropbox > Preferences > Import > Screenshots and check or uncheck the option to \"Share screenshots using Dropbox\". With this box unchecked, your screenshots will save to the desktop.\n\nA: I upgraded to el Capitan and found the shift-cmd-4 had stopped working. Tried everything mentioned above and elsewhere. Have got it working again but only by re-programming the shortcut to Ctrl-p (reminds me of my old Microsoft days...)\nvia System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Screenshots.

So because dropbox wasn't running correctly, it wasn't doing anything. I reopened the dropbox application and that got things sorted. \n\nA: I couldn't find my screenshots either so I asked Siri on my Mac \"find last screenshots\" and she took me to the latest ones I had taken. From there, I went to the Finder search and I typed in the name of the last screenshot I took, which in my case was screenshot 2017... (I still had the Siri open to see the name) and I found them on the Finder. Finally, I saved the shortcut to the desktop with a button on the right hand corner and I don't know why but now they show up directly on my desktop again. Hope this helps someone :) \n\nA: Just relaunch Finder and you'll be back to normal.  Easy peasy.\n", "Q: Is there a way to 'search' for items on the desktop by typing the first few letters of the file name? I am somewhat new to Mac. On my Windows PC if I type the first few letters of a file it will highlight on the desktop (or window). Yet on my new Mac it will only highlight old documents. This makes it quite annoying if I copy a file into a folder full of many other files and want to find it again. Its like I have to wait for the Mac to periodically 'index' its files before I can search in this manner.\nIs there a way to have this work properly?\nAn example of what I mean:\n\nSay I have a .jpg file on my desktop called abc.jpg. If I have no windows or programs open and type the letters 'abc' rapidly then the file abc.jpg becomes highlighted, making it easy to spot amongst the items on the desktop. No problems.\nNow, say, I move a new file, xyz.jpg, from a folder on to the desktop. I then try to locate that file by typing 'xyz' only there is no response - though it is present on the desktop alongside abc.jpg the file does not get highlighted as abc.jpg did earlier. It is only after several days that the new file gets 'indexed'(?) and begins to work with this useful feature.\n\n\nA: Just start typing the filename within the Finder window. It should select the first file that matches.

I wonder, since Facebook tracks all activity you do online when you're logged in using their like button and share buttons for example.\nBecause Facebook is integrated in iOS, does Apple allow Facebook to keep track of my Safari / Chrome searches because I'm logged in iOS? Or does it require a Safari/Chrome login specifically?\nYou don't have to know the exact or full answer, if you know a little detail (with source please) please add it as an answer.\n\nA: No social network is fully integrated into iOS, only the login is. With iOS 6 Apple introduced the Social Framework which, as explained under the what's new page: \n\nThe Social framework provides a simple interface for accessing the user’s social media accounts. This framework supplants the Twitter framework that was introduced in iOS 5 and adds support for other social accounts, including Facebook and Sina’s Weibo service. Apps can use this framework to post status updates and images to a user’s account. This framework works with the Accounts framework to provide a single sign-on model for the user and to ensure that access to the user’s account is approved.\n\nWhen accessing any social network's API (which means retrieving information, posting, etc.) from a different source than the actual social network, an OAuth process is perform to authorize the web page, app or otherwise which is making the call to access the social network's resources on behalf of the user. \nWith the inclusion of the aforementioned framework, developers could acquire this authorization without having to perform the whole process, as the OS had already done it. Doing it like this, the developer just had to ask if there was an logged in account configured for the needed social network.\nFrom a user's point of view, this inclusion meant that you didn't have to log in in every App which implemented social actions.\nConsider too, that iOS Apps are sandboxed, which means that each App has its own space in disk, with its own directories, which act as the home for the app and its data, and no other App has direct access to these.\nSo, I don't believe that any social network has access to your information or movements, as the SO integration is just a way of easing the connection process with the required social network and not that the user is granting it access to any information.\n", "Q: Is it possible to let Picasa use a removable device as the Application Support folder using symbolic links? Picasa stores very large files in Application Support folder which consumes limited disk space in system disk. I wonder if I can use symbolic links in order to make Picasa use removable disk as storage space.\n\nA: Whilst I have no experience with Picasa, I have symlinked many other apps' Application Support folders to other destinations including network drives too without any problems.

Dark one or light one?\nI am asking, because the next day dark area increased in size to whole screen size. And now whole screen is dark. I wonder, is now my whole screen dry or is it wet.\n\nA: I've once got water in a Dell (work)laptop and it started to get lighter and lighter the further water got. This is because the screen is built with multiple layers and you got water between them.\n\nI would definately recommend you to shut down the device and put it in rice.\n\nA: I think Silica gel would work also and could absorb moisture a bit faster I am not so sure because I haven't tried it yet.\n", "Q: Mac App Store Update Today I was checking if there are any updates on Mac App Store and look what type of message came out.

I want to sync/backup my entire Home (/Users/) directory to other computers using Bittorrent Sync.  Right now my Home directory contains my DropBox folder, which (at 17GB) I do not want to be part of this sync/backup.\nI thought an easy way to do this would be to create a Dropbox directory at the /Users level, but even after I set the permissions of that directory to 777, the Dropbox app won't let me move Dropbox there.\nI understand that an alternative is to exclude just the Dropbox directory from the Bittorrent Sync (I assume that's possible - I haven't tried it yet), but I think it would be cleaner to have an easily accessible but separate (outside my Home) directory.

Do you think stuff got smashed around in there when it did that?\n\nA: You are likely doomed.  The store gurus will go over data recovery options and explain they don't fix damaged drives, they are simply going to ask about the status of your backup and whether you want them to test the operation and see if it needs to be exchanged under warranty / AppleCare. \nSome things to try on dead and near dead drives include putting them on their end or sides rather than having them oriented flat - this is because the read/write heads that sit between the actual disc platters may respond better then they are held vertically by gravity rather than horizontally by their precision engineering which sounds like it;s been compromised.  Give it a go, see if it sounds any better (assuming you are not using an iMac where they are are already mounted this way).\nSorry to be the bearer of bad news.\n\nA: Step 1: Stop doing anything with the computer.  Anything you do will likely make the situation worse.\nStep 2: How much is the data worth to you?\nIt sounds like your drive had a mechanical failure.  In this case, your best bet for recovery is to send it off to a professional data-recovery company.  This will cost you about a thousand dollars, and they probably won't be able to recover everything.\nIf your data isn't worth a thousand dollars, you can play around with the drive.  Try running the computer in different orientations (on its side, upside-down, etc) in case the bearings work better when loaded differently.  Try sticking the hard drive in the freezer (in a bag to keep moisture from condensing) for a few hours to see if differential thermal expansion frees things up.  Try rotating the drive rapidly around the spindle axis to free the bearings manually.  But keep in mind that the most likely outcome of doing all this is the total destruction of the drive and all data on it.\n\nA: you DO have a backup of your data? (I hope). I would contact Drive Savers. I doubt if Apple can recover your data, but Drive Savers might be able too.  You best bet would be to get a new drive and restore from your backup. \n\nA: assuming the magnet was powerful enough to mess up the actuator magnet (my guess as to what happened), then the data on the plates is probably beyond messed up. just a guess. move on with your life ;p\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive#Components\nas for the sideways comment, you do realize the magnetic attraction of the head to the plate is about 10,000 times stronger than that, right ;o and in fact, by operating a drive sideways you are indeed causing a small bit of uneven force, as in, less force required for the head to move down that up. although again, doesn't real make a real-world difference.\n\nA: Chance is very little, like 5%. But it would probably recover only a few bits. Try to back up data every time. Or buy a SSD, they are fast and reliable.\n", "Q: How do you force a 5 GHz wifi connection? Wifi networks are often set up in dual-band mode, with the same SSID served on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. I'd like to always use the 5 GHz band (due to interference with Bluetooth and other devices that degrades performance). How do I force Mac OS X to use the 5 GHz base station? (I do not have admin access to the network, so I can't just assign the 5 GHz network a different SSID.)\nNote that this question is not asking how to force a particular flavor of 802.11, rather it is asking how to force a particular frequency band.\n\nA: In short: you can not force a frequency band in OS X 10.9 Mavericks. (On 10.5 you can...)\nYou want to connect to the device using Basic service set identification (BSSID) instead of regular Service set identification (SSID). Connecting to a BBSID will connect you to a specific device regardless of the connection strength. Connecting to SSID will connect you to a specific network name, if similar network names are available it will connect to the best signal/noise ratio. It must be noted that your OS X chooses the wlan, not your router, and OS X switches to the strongest signal available (2.4GHz or 5GHz).\nTo find a specific SSID and BSSID combination, you can run:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport scan\n\nBefore OSX 10.6 you could connect to a specific BSSID using:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport --associate=XXX --bssid=YYY\n\nWhere XXX is the SSID/network name and YYY the MAC address of the base station you want to talk to.\nOn OS X 10.6 and beyond it is no longer possible to connect to BSSID directly. There is no known API for this and no third party Software exists that can do this. So you need to change your 5GHz SSID to a unique name or you need to go back to OS X 10.5, or you can change the 2.4GHz channel from within the router. I think these options are non-valid in your case.\nUPDATE As maxim points out, you can force a frequency band and use that to fix to 5GHz.\nOn linux you can use iwconfig, but this tool is not available for OS X.\n\nA: The only other alternative to using different network names that I've heard of is using iStumbler to manually select the 5GHz signal to connect to.\n\nA: Solution with 2.4ghz/5ghz network with same ssid.\nIf you are already connected to the 2.4 ghz network, you can set just the channel on your airport card, works in latest version of macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (2017-03-19)\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport --channel=52\n\nI've set the channel 52 which is used by my 5ghz network.\n\nA: This is a partial-temporary solution.\nBasically, if the frequencies are on different channel numbers then it is possible to \"set\" the particular wifi band (worked on OSX Mavericks).\nHigh-level overview:\n\n*\n\n*Find the channel numbers of 5 GHz and 2.4 Ghz. Are they different? if yes proceed to step 2.\n\n*Set 5 GHz channel number using airport command.\n\nDetailed instructions:\n\n*\n\n*Open Wireless Diagnostics.app (it is located in\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications).\n\n\n*In the application menu select Window->Utilities (or press cmd+2).Utilities window should appear.\n\n\n*Select WiFi Scan from Utilities window and press Scan Now button. This will show you all available networks, info about them and your active connection.\n\n\n*Now, verify that BSSIDs of 2.4 and 5 Ghz with the same\nnetwork name are on different channel numbers. If so, then most likely you can change the band by setting the channel number of the desired frequency band. Alternatively for steps 1-4, just type in the terminal\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport -s\n\n\n\n*Turn Wifi off on your computer\n\n\n*Open the Terminal.app and type:\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport --channel=**num**\n\nwhere **num** is the channel number to set. This command will only work under administrator account (so make sure that you are log as an Administrator i.e. su YourAdministratorAccount)\n\n\n*Turn Wifi On and connect to the network again\n\n\n*You can check your active connection by Alt+Clicking on the WiFi icon on the OSX menu bar, re-scanning with Wireless Diagnostics or using the terminal :-).\nThat's all!\n\nA: For 10.11.x, because the options for controlling the Broadcom driver are limited, you will want to first disable roaming,\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airport.opproam disabled -bool true\n\nThen make a mesh out of maybe 1/2\" chicken wire and stick it over your laptop to penalize the 2.4 GHz signal. Once you are able to connect to the 5 GHz AP,\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I\n\nyou can remove the mesh and hopefully OSX will not switch BSSID.\nhttp://www.compliance-club.com/archive/keitharmstrong/990810n.gif\n\nA: http://www.adriangranados.com/apps/airtool\nhey i got Airtool as recommended above, it works a treat as a tool for 'targeting' certain network channels, i now have my macs 'force' selecting the best channel in my household/neighbourhood zone, and the 'alt'+ airport icon shows the channels DL speeds so any necessary changes to set to different channels can be done easily in Airtool - highly recommended, free/donateware so i chipped them a few dollars as I've been annoyed by the lack of speeds at home, or rather the mac airport choosing inferior channels on a day to day basis - FWIW i logged the best and worst channels for a few weeks and assuming my neighbours don't keep switching channels nearby i should hope to get the best speeds\n\nA: I've spent some time on this issue and can attest that the only way to force a computer to the 5 GHz band is set up the 5 GHz band with a separate name.\nOtherwise, the computer will auto connect to 5 GHz if it's close to the access point. At 15-20 feet away depending on obstructions, the computer will connect to 2.4 GHz if you use the same SSID for each band.\nApple tech support says that's the way it is, but you could certainly contact them to see if anything has changed recently...\nSorry.\n\nA: My work need me to force my Macbook Air to link at specific channel of 5GHz and for some reason, I can't use airport utility achieve that.\nMy workaround is using Airtool to force my Macbook Air wireless interface to work at specific 5GHz channel or 2.4GHz channel and channel bandwidth (20Mhz/40Mhz).\nIt works as my expectation and maybe it can solve part of your situation.\nMy Macbook Air is running OS X 10.10.\n\nA: Why not use the same SSID, but give different password for 5GHz, vs 2.4GHz, that way you know what you are connecting to :D\n\nA: Most devices choose the strongest signal. So set the 5GHz AP(s) to maximum power and then just diminish the broadcast power of the 2.4GHz AP(s) until 5GHz is seen to be preferable.\nThe price you pay is that any 2.4-only devices will have even more problems with congestion. But perhaps escaping congestion on most devices is worth that.\n\nA: Simple, get a router with support for band-steering. It will take care of moving your 5Ghz devices (if advertised in capability) to 5Ghz bands.\n\nA: Lets say you want to use the same SSID on both radios (bands). This is important if you want your devices to communicate (say a printer is being shared on the 2.4 GHz via Bonjour). On the router management software, you may have the option to control how devices associate with the radios (bands). On DD-WRT for instance, you can enable MAC level filtering (allow/permit a MAC(s) or block/prevent MAC(s) from associating). In my setup, I have only allowed (Permit mode) one old legacy Apple airport to connect to my 2.4 GHz SSID. This forces the newer clients to connect to the 5 GHz radio even if the 2.4 looks tastier (better signal). Elegant enough for me.\nHere's a nice link on how to only permit certain devices (note, you will see both interfaces on your router): https://snaz.com/adding-security-to-your-wifi-network-with-a-mac-white-list/\n\nA: There are some apps (like WiFi Scanner) that will let you join the 5GHz band in case Mac OS chose the 2.4GHz one.\n", "Q: Turn off auto-hiding dock and menu bar Recently I played a TV show on my TV using HDMI and used clamshell mode for my Macbook Pro. Now whenever I'm in Safari, both the menubar at the top and the Dock automatically hide. It only happens when I'm in Safari, though; whenever I'm in Mail, Textmate, or any other app, the menubar and Dock show normally. I can ask the Dock to not auto-hide, and it keep this setting until I switch to another app - if I right click on the Dock and select 'Turn Hiding Off' and switch to another app, it forgets and hides again.\nIs there any setting that I can change to make this not happen? \nEdit: I think this was a bug, since the suggestions from both @AaronEllington and @David Corbin weren't applicable; I wasn't currently in full screen mode and hitting the escape key didn't do anything. In any case I accidentally closed Safari and it was fine after reopening. I'm keeping this question open in case anyone else experiences the same issue or if it happens to me again.\n\nA: It sounds like what you are describing is what happens when you go in full screen mode in any app, the menu bar and the dock hide regardless of the dock auto-hide settings. I would suggest just resizing the safari window instead of putting it in full screen mode. (If that is what is happening.)\n\nA: Simply open Safari and click the Escape key and you should be back to normal.\n", "Q: Listing order on App Store In App Store app, if I search for a word.  What does the returned listing order of apps base on?  Let's say, it returned app1, app2, app3, ..., app10.  What was the listing order based upon?\n\nA: It is sorted by relevance by default, but you can change it in the upper right corner, by clicking relevance. The option are then\n\n\n*\n\n*Relevance\n\n*Most popular\n\n*Release date\n\n*Customer rating\n\n\n\n", "Q: YouTube not working on Apple TV I cant view YouTube  on Apple TV I only see the loading circle any suggestion on how to fix it would be appreciated\n\nA: Try go into General and restart, This worked for me.\n", "Q: SSH to Macbook works when lid closed (and plugged in to power) I noticed that my PuTTY session to my MacBook (which is now on Mavericks 10.9.3) seems to stay alive with the clamshell closed so long as the power cable is plugged in to the laptop. This can be seen by unplugging the power, the terminal stops responding after 10 seconds or so, but comes back once I plug power back in, all while the cover is closed.\nWhile this is extremely convenient given how my desk is set up, I can't help but wonder how overheating can be prevented. Obviously some reasonable level of CPU clock and power management would take care of it, but I would only be extremely impressed and remain incredulous that this is something that has been achieved. \nSo, what's going on here? Is this the \"Power Nap\" feature at work? If I start running some CPU loading benchmark from the command line now, what will happen? \nI tested just now by running yes > /dev/null & yes > /dev/null & yes > /dev/null & yes > /dev/null &, and it sure did get the fans spinning, I open it up and it was definitely pretty toasty, so that would not have been good if I had the machine out of physical reach. \n\nA: Yes, this is the Power Nap feature at work. On Mac notebooks, by default, Power Nap is configured as enabled when it's connected to AC power and configured as disabled when on battery (you can see this from System Preferences > Energy Saver). This is why you're seeing different behavior when connected to mains power and when on battery.\nYou don't have to worry about overheating since the Power Nap feature comes with built-in protection for it. Read the OS X: About Power Nap article for more information. It states (emphasis mine):\n\nPower Nap communicates and transfers data for a only a few minutes per Power Nap cycle when running on battery. When connected to a power adapter, communications and data transfers are continuous. When Power Nap is enabled your computer may be warm to the touch even if it is sleeping. Power Nap operations are suspended when your computer exceeds a predefined temperature so that your computer does not overheat.\n\n\nA: Concerning the question of overheating. Whether the clam is open or closed makes no difference. The keyboard is neither engineered to dissipate heat nor does it serve that function. The back fan vent on your machine is the only component responsible for heat dissipation. As long as this is not obstructed, there is no issue. \n", "Q: Is it okay to uninstall the old versions of iWork/iLife after their respective upgrades that come with OSX Mavericks? I noticed after upgrading to OSX Mavericks that shiny, new versions of many iWork and iLife apps had appeared. Yet, the old versions remained installed. All the new versions seem capable of opening (and in the case of iPhoto, upgrading) old version ('09, etc) documents/libraries. They also seem capable of saving in these older formats.\nIs there any reason to keep them? Or should I simply drag the old versions to the trash?\nIf uninstalling is the right choice, is there anything that needs to be done other than dragging to the trash?\nIs it possible to remove the old versions, but retain the templates and other data specific to the old versions? The new templates are stellar, but being able to keep the old ones (e.g., in Pages) would be a nice bonus–double the templates.\nLastly, is there any impact on iCloud in doing so?\nAny other thoughts between the versions, and keeping vs/upgrading? I have Time Machine backups, anyway, so I can always go back (presumably) and restore them should I need the old versions in the future.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can uninstall them if you like. Apple leaves them behind so you can compare the feature sets and UI redesign to see if you want to use the new apps or retain the old ones. I personally dislike the new design, as it is too simplified and was missing some key features, at least in Keynote, which I use the most.\nRemember, though, that whenever you click on an iLife document, it will always open in the new app. If you set the default app on a document to the old iWork app in a Get-Info window, Finder will soon change it back! Even worse, Software Update will pop up a daily asking to upgrade to the the iWork apps, with no way to turn this notice off.\nInsidious nonsense.\n", "Q: How can I set the camera to default to HDR on? I'd like to set my (iOS7) iPhone's camera to always default to HDR on. I do enable HDR when I'm taking pictures, but it always seems like the iPhone forgets the setting and goes back to HDR off.\n\nA: This depends on the \"Flash\" settings you select:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flash-Auto : HDR - Auto\n\n*Flash-Off : HDR - On\n\n*Flash-On : HDR - OFF\n\n\nSo, whenever you force the Flash ON, HDR reverts to OFF. Alternatively, turning Flash OFF retains the HDR ON setting \n\nA: On a stock (non-jailbroken) iPhone running iOS 7, this appears to not be possible (see for example https://discussions.apple.com/message/23530580#23530580#23530580). Yes, turning on the flash will automatically disable HDR, but even if the flash is left off the camera will eventually revert to non-HDR mode.\n", "Q: Copy and paste stops working For several months now i've had an issue where after using my laptop for a couple of weeks without restarting, i'll slowly lose my ability to copy and paste. First it's only between different apps such as Terminal and Sublime Text, but eventually it's system wide and stops working everywhere.\nAs I type this, nothing seems to be copying to clipboard. Not in textedit, chrome, safari, terminal or otherwise.\nGoing in to Finder > Clipboard shows only one small piece of text which is the last thing I successfully copied before it completely stopped working.\nShould I dump a process list here to show what i've got running or is there a common issue that could be the cause?\nI'm on a 13\" retina macbook pro running 10.9.\nThanks\nEdit 1: It's drag and drop too.\nEdit 2: After trying a million fixes found on the internet (changing file permissions, /private/var fixes, disabling hidden files from showing etc, killing third-party processes one by one), none of it worked. I did find however that killing the WindowServer process, which esentially closes all windows and resets the GUI, does provide a bandaid \"fix\" to the problem and bring copy&paste/drag&drop back. However, this is not particularly surprising. It's almost as inconvenient as simply restarting, which was my old fix. Still would like to figure out the underlying cause. My main suspect is the Windows apps I run via Crossover are messing with something in the system, even after killing Crossover and their processors.\nEdit 22/6: I will post a process list and result from kextstat | grep -v com.apple once the issue arrises again.\n\nA: This may happen when some system service crashed/was restarted. The applications started before can't exchange their copy buffer with applications started later. If you quit an earlier started application and start it new, it works again properly.\n\nA: Please check whether the pbcopy command works correctly.\nIf it fails, then the advice from here may help by restarting the pasteboard service, e.g.:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.pboard\nlaunchctl start com.apple.pboard\n\nIf this won't help, and you'd like to avoid restart, you may try remapping your Copy&Paste shortcuts by Karabiner app. See: Remap Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl-X.\n\nA: Whenever I have this problem it's because I've accidentally turned mouse keys on. (Option + 5) This is only the case if you have a keyboard without a numpad though.\n\nA: This sounds like an extreme answer, but it's not. \nIf you are on OSX 10.8+ press alt as the computer boots, go into disk utility and verify/repair everything. Then go to reinstall OSX. I've done this at least a dozen times when I've messed up,OS files. It doesn't touch your files, just OSX files. It will take several hours and a good internet connection, but it has fixed every OS level problem I've ever had. \n\nA: First sorry for the length of this post and for the spelling I am dyslexic....\nPeople are giving answers without having the info needed to give a good answer.\nThe info that Martin needs to give is:\n1) How he is trying to do the cut and paste (only with the mouse or using the keyboard (\"command+c\" for copy and \"command+v\" for paste) or both or using the menu items?\n2) Is highlight the object to C+P the problem?\n3) What software is installed and running?  (because the problem get's worse over time it sounds like a \"memory leak\" from a program with a bug in it)\nHe tells use what he has done and why (looked at answers on the internet) but applying answers you find on the internet without knowing the cause can make matters worse.\nNow for a answer based on the information given: As his problem is something that gets worse over time it must be down to something that is happing over time or something that is triggered at certain times it must be software.  \nWhy not hardware?  The time frame is weeks not second, minutes or hours then it is unlikely to be hardware.\nIt is very unlikely to be the OS, Why? because we don't see this problem on all other systems running the same version of the OS X that he is running.\nIt is very unlikely to be a \"permissions\" problem because it happens after a time frame of a week.  If it was \"permissions\" then it would happen straight (right away)  off and all the time. \nSo what is left:  Installed Software.\nMartin says killing the \"WindowServer\" sort of fixes the problem: Why? All software that uses cut and past uses the \"WindowServer\" and if any software is overwhelming the \"WindowServer's cut&past services\" maybe by a memory leak due to a bug then this symptom is to be expected. Also as OS X uses cache systems, both memory and disk killing the buggy process will not clear the cache or fix the symptom.  So tracking down the software is not going to be easy or quick.\nSo knowing the above; even though he kills the Crossover programs and that douse not work we can say that it still might be the programs used with Crossover or Crossover itself that is leading to the problem especially if Martin is cutting and pasting between programs running in Crossover and OS X programs.  Without knowing what other programs he uses including what ones he using with Crossover it is hard to move forward.\nWhat can Martin do? \n1) Shut the computer down more frequently.\n2) Note how long it takes before the first error happens and keep a running log of what programs he has had running in that time.\n3) Take note of if the problem starts right after a particular program is used.\n4) Find a way of working without Crossover programs find MAC OS X alternatives\n5) If you can't move from windows programs and have an intel mac then think about using VMware and bootcamp install of Crossover \n6) If you must use Crossover then you need to find the program causing the problem and that is going to take a long time as you say it thats weeks for the problem to start. the points below are for this process. \n7) Work with only Mac programs for a while (just over the time it takes for the problem to start and if the problem has not started then the problem must be with programs running under Crossover or Crossover itself.\n8) Only work with mac programs and one other program under Crossover if the problem happens the :-) you found it.\n9) Only work with mac programs and another program under Crossover if the problem happens the :-) you found it.\n10) repeat 8 to 9 until the problem happens :-) you found it.\n11) backup your data files\n12) re-format/erase your disk\n13) reinstall OS X \n\nA: This is perhaps a mistaken sudo command that deleted a file or a virus.\nFrom your description it seems that it is most likely a virus.\nIn which case you need to reinstall mavericks somehow. Yep viruses really suck.\nBut first there are a few other things you can try.\nSolution to the problem: \n\n\n*\n\n*Try and look through your permissions using Disk Utility, see if anything looks funky.\n\n*If your are using the apple mighty mouse, it has been prone to have problems with copy and paste functions.\n\n*Check and see if you have any Logitech application installed, they also have been prone to causing problems with copy and paste.\n\n*Many printer applications can cause similar problems, especially Lexmark.\n\n*Oh and make sure your mouse has the secondary button function turned on in system preferences.\n\n*If none of these things are working and you don't want to buy a new computer or somehow reinstall your entire OS, try this. (Warning you have to be a little bit of a hacker (not much of a hacker really though)). Reinstall your important system files.\"WHAT?!\" You might be thinking. \"HOW?!!\". Well I'll tell you.  Get out your old install Mavericks disk or application and find the system files. Then right click on the application (or the application on the disk) and select \"Show Package Contents\". Then it will bring up a folder of the application contents. Go into the contents folder and select MacOS folder. Inside is the file \"Install Mac OS X Mavericks\". Double click then go through the package install steps and your good to go!\n\n*And yet even if that doesn't work then call apple to ask if you can re-install in an even more manual way.\n\n\nA: I faced the same issue.\nI was not able to copy from TextEdit to Mail using cmd+C cmd+V.\nThen I realized that I had enabled \"Paste and Match Style\" for all applications in System Preferences->KeyBoard->Shortcuts->App Shortcuts.\nI changed \"Paste and Match Style\" only for Textedit app in system preferences and then I was able to copy paste from TextEdit to Mail.\n", "Q: Why is opencv not using all cores after upgrading to Mavericks? I'm running a CPU intensive command on Mavericks (Opencv_traincasscade).  Under Mountain Lion the process used to use all 8 cores all the way though.  However after upgrading it drops to 1 core after a short time.\n\nCould this be app nap? Is there anything I can do to fix this?\n\nA: Being able to use multiple-cores or threads is dependent on the process. This is not AppNap or OS X causing the change.\nYour process, opencv_traincascade, may be resource constrained after a few moments and thus reduced to queuing up tasks as it waits for disk access or another limited resource.\nIn this case you may need to switch to a different build of OpenCV:\n\nNote that opencv_traincascade application can use TBB for multi-threading.

Will I have some delays or it will handle okay? \nThanks.\n\nA: If you can handle going from a 27\" screen to a 13\" screen (even though it's retina, the 'apparent' resolution is set quite low), then the rest of the system is fast.\nOf course, you would want as much RAM and SSD as you can afford (you can't upgrade it later), but there is nothing to worry about with the CPU or the SSD speed.\nIn fact, the SSD alone will make it seem SUPER fast compared to a 3-4 year-old iMac (assuming it didn't have an SSD in it also).\nIf you needed an external GPU, then your only laptop Mac option these days is the top-end 15\" Retina MBP, but that's larger and quite a bit more expensive than the 13\" models.\n\nA: It depends on your precise using of your iMac. Normally the 13\" will fit but if you want a little more power you should think about the processor upgrade to i7. If you´ve more demands to the graphic card you also should think about the 15\" because of a better retina graphic card (Intel Iris Pro Graphic instead of Intel Iris Graphic) or a second graphic card.\nHighly recommend is a upgrade to the max RAM: 16GB.\nIf you don´t need a large SSD at the moment lay back and save your money. Later you could swap the SSD. Differently to the RAM (which is soldered to the logic board) the SSD is swapable.

How iMessage push works? I would like make sure, how push in iOS works. Is it just about frequent requests to the servers?\nSecond question is how iMessage works? It is free of cost, works over the Internet (using the data transfer), but it is also based on frequent requests to some server or it is somehow classical GSM BTS backed?\n\nA: About Push Notifications\n\nAs its name suggests, Apple Push Notification service (APNs) uses a push design to deliver notifications to devices and computers. A push design differs from its opposite, a pull design, in that the recipient of the notification passively listens for updates rather than actively polling for them. A push design makes possible a wide and timely dissemination of information with few of the scalability problems inherent with pull designs. APNs uses a persistent IP connection for implementing push notifications.\n\niMessage uses the same protocol as APNs (source), so it is pushed from the server, and does not use GSM.\n\nA: iMessage use a protocol called \"XMPP\", it is a real communication system uses in many popular chatroom like those in Facebook, google+. So iMessage does NOT use push, but email does.\nXMPP is a open source freeware so it is free(although you need to pay for your network fee).\nCheck Wiki http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP for more information.\n", "Q: Ran Repair Disk on Boot Camp partition and Windows won't boot Unfortunately I accidentaly hit the REPAIR DISK while my Windows 7 bootcamp partition was selected.

Yes, dumb as hell and now I have to pay for being careless.\nSo the repair disk ran for roughly 2 minutes until I realize it was the Windows 7 partition. So I cancelled it.

Push notifications usually appear in the Notification Center in the top right corner of your desktop. Read more about it here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht5362\nIf you disable the service, you'll probably lose notifications for events such as received iMessage-messages, Facetime calls and notification from websites that you have requested notifications from.\nFrom what you write, there does not seem to be a weighty reason for disabling it. It is a normal, system service that should not pose a problem to your system.\nThe connections in FIN_WAIT_1 state does not pose a problem to your system. You can safely ignore it (in those numbers).\nYou can also safely ignore the log message. The log message does not indicate that there has been a \"data leak\" as such.\nThe reason for the log message is that Apple uses a large number of servers for sending your push notifications. Your computer will connect to a (somewhat) random of those servers. The server will present a generic certificate for the service, and not one customized to the exact \"sub-server\" you have connected to. That is the cause of the log message. This is something Apple needs to fix on their servers, but it is a known bug and not something you yourself can do anything about. \nThis does not mean that you lose encryption or anything like that, but it might mean that your system could be vulnerable to a Man-In-The-Middle attack, where you could be sent falsified Push Notifications. Whether that is indeed the case would require further research. It is most likely that Apple employed some sort of certificate pinning or similar to avoid this type of exploit. The likelihood that you should be attacked this way is pretty low anyhow. I.e. don't worry about it.\nI don't see why you say the daemon is \"misbehaving\". It is not misbehaving more on your computer than on any other computer. You could say that it is misbehaving, but it is doing so by Apple's design. So instead, create bug reports with Apple to let them know that you're seeing a problem. \nOf course, if you do not actually use Push Notifications for anything, you can safely disable it.\n", "Q: If I turn iMessage off, will I receive those messages when I turn it back on? I am currently wanting to turn iMessage off, for unsaid reasons, but I want to read the messages people send me. They don't have iPhones, so iMessage is the best bet.\n\nA: You need to turn off iMessage on all the devices that have it on. If you have iMessage enabled on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, turning one off will not disable iMessage entirely.\nFor example, if you enable iMessage on iPhone and Mac, but only turn off the one on iPhone, People can still send iMessage your phone number or email linked to your iMessage account on Mac.\nAnswering your question, the message will appear on the devices that has iMessage but not on the one you’ve disabled, however, if you turn off iMessage on all devices, then your friends will send you a normal text message.\n\nA: Only iPhone have iMessage, so if you said no one have iPhone, I don't think they can send you a iMessage. \nAfter you turn iMessage back on, you won't be able to get those message back.\n", "Q: GIMP doesn't open I installed gimp from macports on my MacBook Air Mavericks.

It should be doing a native build but from your error log it looks like it's doing an X11 build. Having to run an X11 server to use GIMP would be...silly, right?\nSince GIMP 2.8.2 it's been available as a native app for OS X. No need to install it via MacPORTS, no need for an X11 server to be running to use it. My suggestion is you ditch the MacPORTs version and get it directly from here: http://gimp.org/downloads -- you'll save yourself a ton of dependency headaches. It'll Just Work(tm).\n\nA: There is no specific reason to suspect a permission from what you have described.\nCould you elaborate on what exactly you have installed, from where you got it, and how you installed it?\nIf you download the pre-compiled binary from gimp.org for OS X (Native Build) and get version 2.8.2 or later (preferably get the newest version 2.8.10) - the installation package should be self-contained.\nIf you have installed an earlier version, you need to install an X11 environment first. If this is a new Mavericks installed, you need to download and install XQuartz before it will run. Note: This is only if you install an old version of GIMP - I would recommend simply installing the latest version.\nIf you have already installed the latest version of the native build of GIMP from gimp.org, then try this approach to finding the reason for the program not starting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*Run command: open /Applications/GIMP.app\n(or whatever the application is called on your system)\nCheck the terminal window for error messages that could indicate the reason for the program not starting up correctly.\n", "Q: How can I access my time capsule through ssh? I am trying to reach the time capsule on a remote network. After following the advice of another question I realised the router/network doesn't support NAT-PMP/UPnP and thus I get to configure the time capsule as available through icloud, but I'm never able to reach it outside of the network.\nHowever, I am able to ssh into an old powerpc I have port mapped on the router to a static IP. Is there any way to tunnel the time capsule backup through ssh? I've also tried sshuttle which works perfectly to forward dns/http requests. But it doesn't seem to make time capsule backups available, since the finder doesn't show any shared devices on the network.\nI would gladly try a solution like FreeLan but unfortunately their support goes back to 10.7 and the old PowerPC machine inside the remote network serving as entry only has 10.5.x.\n\nA: You would need to forward TCP port 548, which is AFP (Apple Filing Protocol). This is the storage protocol used by Time Machine to access content on a Time Capsule.\nNote: This will not necessarily make it possible for your remote systems to auto detect the Time Capsule - as any DNS information (Bonjour) you forward would probably be incorrect as it needs to be translated (i.e. a different IP-address).\nConnect to the Time Capsule directly using the IP instead. From Finder select Go => Connect to Server and then enter: afp://123.123.123.123/ \nSubstitute your own IP ofcourse!\n", "Q: Setting and using a \"language\" property of an audio file in iTunes? I'm a linguaphile, and I have lots of audio files in different languages in iTunes.  I would like the ability to tag a file with the language code, and to see and/or sort by that tag. \nI have no use for Grouping or BPM, so I could use one of those.  But it would be nice to be able to set it in the Get Info window, and to actually see the word \"language\" in the column headings. \nIs there a way to add a column to the list of available columns? \nIs there a way to add a column not shown, or an ID3 tag not shown, to the Get Info window?\nAny search method I can think of is just going to give me a zillion pages about the user-interface language.  If I change the user interface to Canadian English, and add a localization for grouping → language, will that break anything?\n\nA: The set of available columns appears to be fixed, and there is no language column.  But the way to change the set of displayed columns is by contextual menu (right-click) on the column headers.  (At least in 12.1—Apple seems to take pleasure in making sure we can't ever get accustomed to any particular UI for iTunes.)\nThere is a \"category\" column which I will use.  Not ideal, but better than usurping BPM or grouping.\nUpdate: Changed my mind.  I can put lang: es; in Grouping and search for that in a \"smart playlist.\"  That still allows me to put other things in Grouping.\n\nA: iTunes does not have a language column and you cannot add one.\nHowever, beaTunes does offer such a column and is also capable of guessing which language a song might be in, based on title, album and lyrics (if available). If you turn embedding in its general preferences on, it even embeds said language value.\n", "Q: How to change the default shell in iTerm? I'm having some difficulties in changing the value of $SHELL in OSX's iTerm app. iTerm is starting in /bin/zsh, but the value of $SHELL doesn't seem to change. \nWhat I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changed \"command\" as /bin/zsh in iTerm's configuration window.\n\n*Executed chsh to change the shell to /bin/zsh.\n\n*Confirmed iTerm is started in /bin/zsh\nNOTE #1: In OSX's stock terminal app, \"Terminal.app\":\necho $SHELL\n/bin/zsh\n\nNOTE #2: In OSX's popular terminal app, \"iTerm.app\":\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n\n$ echo $USER\n$ melvkim\n\n$ chsh -s /bin/zsh\nChanging shell for melvkim.\nPassword for melvkim:\nchsh: no changes made\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue but I resolved it by executing the command chsh -s /bin/zsh in the terminal,then navigated to\n\nTerminal -> Preferences -> General window\n\nand changed the Shells open with: option to Default login shell while the command (complete path) set to /bin/zsh.This should solve your problem.\n\nA: Look here for the excellent explanation and solution posted by @mklement0 [in relation to a bash upgrade problem.\nI had a similar problem in doing the opposite on my system (OS X 10.10.1): making bash the default login shell again after I had installed oh-my-zsh, which made zsh the default, and then upgrading bash from 3.2.53 to 4.3.30 using Homebrew (why is Apple shipping Yosemite with an old bash version?).\nI think the SHELL environment variable reflects but does not control the actual default login shell for the user.  For example, if, say, bash was your default and you open a new bash shell window from terminal then $ export SHELL=\"/bin/zsh\"; echo \"$SHELL\" would show /bin/zsh but no actual change will occur because if you open a new shell window from terminal and do $ echo $0 then you would see -bash ($0 contains the name and path of the command that started the shell window, in this case bash, and the - next to it indicates that it is a login shell).\nAs @mklement0 pointed out the actual default login shell for the user is controlled by the UserShell property in the user's record in the system's internal database - this can be queried and updated using the command line utility dscl.  This information will passed to your terminal app when you open a shell window.\nWhat chsh -s /bin/zsh does is change this UserShell property to set it to zsh - you can check this by doing dscl . -read /Users/$USER/ UserShell immediately afterwards, and you will see UserShell: /bin/zsh.  But the change is not effected in the current window, until you do something like exec su - $USER as suggested by @mklement0, or until you close and open a shell window.\n\nA: The problem was the \"iTerm\" app's conflicting settings with the shell. To resolve, I've reset \"login shell\" command in iTerm preference window:\n\niTerm.app -> Preferences -> Profiles -> General -> Command -> Click on \"Login shell\"\n\nThen, I executed chsh to modify it as /bin/zsh. \nTo reproduce the problem (having $SHELL set as /bin/bash/, even though the login shell is /bin/zsh), I just had to change \"iTerm\" setting back to \"Command: /bin/zsh/\".\n\nA: The -s flag for chsh only attempts to change the shell, and probably fails due to Open Directory:  The usual UNIX system 'chsh' would modify the /etc/passwd entry.   However, I was able to run chsh with no arguments, which gave me an editor, and the following information:\n# Changing user information for nevin.\n# Use \"passwd\" to change the password.\n##\n# Open Directory: /Local/Default\n##\nShell: /bin/tcsh\nFull Name: Nevin Williams\nOffice Location:\nOffice Phone:\nHome Phone:\n\nI was able to edit the \"Shell:\" entry to /bin/zsh, and subsequent Terminal windows opened with a Z-shell prompt.\n\nA: Try executing the command: chsh -s /bin/zsh from the default Mac terminal.\n\nA: I had a similar issue.  The Terminal would open into bash.  csh -s /bin/zsh would fail with an error.  Examining the default shell in System Preferences->Users by control-clicking on my user showed /bin/zsh was set.  dscl showed /bin/zsh was set.  I tried resetting Terminal->Preferences to /bin/zsh.  That also failed.\nUltimately, it turned out there was a lockfile.  Going to ~/Library/Preferences, I deleted com.apple.Terminal.plist.lockfile and com.apple.Terminal.plist.  That fixed the problem.  On the next startup, zsh loaded correctly in the terminal.\n", "Q: Do i need a seperate dedicated machine to run osx server or can i use some features running it from my MBP We've got 5 desktop devices in our organization which im currently managing using a remote connection client or physically by sitting at each machine. \nEach change i make such as an update / settings change has to be made one by one across all machines. \nI was reading up online and got pointed towards an osx server - http://www.apple.com/osx/server/ - which looks like the sort of thing i need. \nThe feature i really liked the look of is the Profile Manager, which looks like it would let me manage the config and updates of machines. \nThe other features we dont really need right now for instance, we currently use Dropbox for file sharing and i think this will continue as this has a mobile app (accessible when off site using 3g) which we find really useful.\nIf i just want to use the Profile Manager, can i setup the server on my day to day machine (2012 MBP - 10.9.2) whilst still be able to use it as before, or do i need to get a dedicated machine to run the server on ? Or is there another option for config and one to many updates on osx ?\n\nA: You don't need a dedicated machine, as server can be installed on any machine providing it meets system requirements without much change to the actual system, unlike the older osx-server, but it's probably a good idea.\nI have installed Server.app before on my MBP to test some features and its worked fine for this. The only problem with installing it on a MacBook is that when the machine is off, the services on the other devices start throwing errors as they are unable to connect to services which they consider should always be available. For instance, Profile Manager can set up MDM on iOS devices, which works great until the server becomes unavailable unexpectedly (the device can connect to the network) — errors ensue.\nObviously other features such as Websites won't work if the machine is down, but this should be fine as you mentioned you won't be using such services.\n", "Q: How do you rotate a cell in Numbers (3.2)? I want to rotate the header row by 45 degrees to look like this (from Excel). \n\nHow do you do this in Numbers?\n\nA: This is currently not possible within cells.\nAs a workaround, you can change the angle of the text labels for the X axis on a chart and use this as the header for your table.\n\nAlternatively, you can create text boxes and rotate these.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple regarding this on the following page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/feedback/numbers.html\n", "Q: Mobile account, syncing certain files Under mobile account preferences I have selected \"Home folder\".

In mobile accounts is there a way to exclude certain files? \nI forgot to ask but does enabling \"sync home folder\" mean that only the current user the account synced or all users of the computer have there home direcotry synced?\n\n\nA: Your home folder is by default the folder that opens when you click Finder.\nIt's located at /Users/yourusername and is usually shortened to ~. This folder includes all the folders which contains your data such as Documents, Movies, Pictures, etc.\nMobile account syncing will sync everything in this folder.

If the phone was running out of memory and had to kill processes, then more memory would make it seem faster.\nWhat really makes phones, (or any computer-like device for that matter) run faster, is a fast processor. The iPhone 4 also has a faster processor than the 3GS.\n", "Q: What does this technical specification about GSM iPhone mean?

The 800 MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in\nJapanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by\nApple.[51] However, the 800 MHz band is a subset of the 850 MHz band,\nwhich probably explains why the device is advertised as\nquad-band.[citation needed] The chip-sets were manufactured by\nSkyworks Solutions[52] and Infineon for GSM version.\n\n", "Q: How to remove launchpad icon of broken application I installed gimp from macports and uninstalled it (port uninstall gimp) when I found its not well maintained as gimp released its native mac build.

Similarly to setting\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"-v\"\n\nwhich boots in verbose mode, I tried\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"-t\"\n\nbut to no avail. Any idea?\n\nA: From this (very useful!) page : http://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-manage-os-x-boot-options-with-wireless-keyboards/\nI found the answer you want. And I quote:\n\nThe \"boot-args\" variable can be used for setting the above modes. but in addition if you need to load the system into Target Disk mode, you can do so by setting the \"target-mode\" PRAM variable in the following way (this will be enabled only once for the next time the system is started):\nsudo nvram target-mode=1\n\n\nIt looks like you can't get it to do that on every boot - but you could write a startup script that waited for a minute then set that parameter again then rebooted.

What's the most efficient way to export tunes bought with iTunes that are protected aac to FLAC for playing on other music hardware (still for personal use)?\n2 methods I can think of so far are:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a playlist of all the purchased songs in the library, rip to CD, then rip the CD to FLAC. Disadvantage: with 80+ tunes, this would require multiple CDs. But I'm assuming that titles of the tunes are recorded as CD-text, is this true?\n\n*same as above but instead of ripping to CD, use SoundFlower to record the output. Disadvantage: no CDs required but will have to manually split the recording into each track and name it.\nAny better ideas? Thanks.\n\nA: Try uploading all your music to itunes match. In my experience, when you re-download it all of the protection has been removed.\n\nA: Have you looked at xACT? I think I've been using this software for more than ten years (wow, I can't believe it), and the author is still actively developing it. Its really good stuff.\nAlso, AAC is lossy, and FLAC is lossless, so converting AAC to FLAC really isn't appropriate. Are you sure that your files are AAC? If the files have a suffix of .m4a, this doesn't mean that the audio necessarily is AAC, as it could also be ALAC, in which case it would be appropriate to convert from ALAC to FLAC, and xACT can help you do that. First you'd decode your files to an uncompressed format, either AIFF or WAV, then reencode to lossless flac. There is no generation loss with this method.\n\n\nA: The free solution is to use iTunes playlist to burn to CD but instead of burning to a CD, burn to a \"virtual CD\", having already installed the Free full-featured 15 day trial of Virtual CD-RW. iTunes will see this like any other regular drive.\nThen on a Windows machine (or via BootCamp) use CueTools open source software to extract out to FLAC the audio from the .bin (helped by.cue files) that the Virtual CD-RW application generated.\nThen use the playlist .m3u .txt or .xml file to rename the extracted flac files as their artist - song or use MusicBrainz Picard to fingerprint them or write a batch script to rename the files from the iTunes playlist file.\nThe result should be that you would have FLAC files that have the same audio fidelity when played as playing them from iTunes. Of course, the FLAC files are much larger at around 6 times the size or more than the original protected m4p files but with storage being cheaper: multi-terabyte drives large capacity micro SD cards, this is not so much as an issue compared to when lossy compressed audio files became popular for their smaller size. In any case, my only motivation is for personal use and freedom to play my purchased music on any of my own devices, independent of application, not to illegally distribute.\n", "Q: Removing pages from a sub-document I have ten documents, 01.pdf to 10.pdf, that I would like to print.

I can open 01.pdf using Preview, mark 02.pdf to 10.pdf in the Finder and drag to Preview's thumbnail section. Now printing will indeed print all pages. The trouble is that ⌘⌫ will not delete the occasional cover page, but the entire sub-document. Solution(s)?\nI'm comfortable with any method (Terminal, MacPorts, ...), though using just Preview would be nice.\n\nA: One solution is to print the document after assembling the sub-documents, and to then choose \"Open PDF in Preview\".

I just got a shiny new rMBP 15\" and want to migrate the account from an older Mac - I've been using a late 2010 MBA.

It's an MBA, so no ethernet for me, also no Thunderbolt (late 2010s didn't have it yet).\nAre there any other options available? Can I force the Assistant to 'migrate' to an external drive somehow, and then import that to MBP?\nMaybe there is a step-by-step guide to migrate 'by hand' using a USB stick or something?\n\nA: The best way to migrate is to make sure you have a current Time Machine backup and just restore from that volume to the new machine. I have restored from a Time Machine backup to an empty formatted hard drive and it worked perfectly, including my custom FTP, HTTP, and git configurations. It took about 10 hours for a 1TB backup.\n", "Q: MBP shut down and will not power back on My MacBook unexpectedly shutdown and not responding to power button or even battery status button, the lights on battery status isn't showing too.

Should I try resetting in verbose mode?\n\nA: This is a known issue with Snow Leopard and Google Drive. I've seen this many times before and deleting Google Drive completely from the Macbook usually fixes it without issue. When you reinstalled Snow Leopard did you do a clean install or was it truly just a reinstall. If you really got rid of Google Drive and it's not booting sounds like something may have happened to the hard drive. I would try a clean restore of Snow Leopard before taking any hardware action. :)\n", "Q: Split Keynote Builds Into Separate Slides I need a method that takes a Keynote presentation with multiple build animations (appear, disappear, etc.) as input and splits each slide into several new slides, one new slide for each build animation.

I have four Macs I want networked together so files can be shared between them without email. I want it to be a wired network and I also want to be able to access the files on the network away from anywhere. A backup on a portable hardrive and an online backup would be a plus. Is OS X server what I need and maybe a dropbox? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am not sure what to do!\n\nA: There are several ways to accomplish this. Let's list your requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiple Macs.\n\n*Shared files between them.\n\n*Wired network.\n\n*Backups either online or local.\n\n*Remote access to files.\n\n\nWhile OS X Server is certainly useful here (especially if you wanted a VPN), it isn't necessary. Assuming all of your PCs are on the network, I would set up a NAS (network attached storage device) and locate my files there. Many NAS also have the ability to share files out remotely. \nAlternatively, you could load Dropbox, Box.net, or some similar service on each device, and share specific folders to each user account. This would allow you to more easily integrate devices external to your network into your file sharing system. Each such service offers varying tiers of free space, and you pay as you add onto them. An added bonus would be the ability to roll back file changes, or recover deletions (at least DropBox has this feature.)\nAs with any setup, your mileage will vary.\n", "Q: How to make MacBook automatically connect to different wifi networks as desired? My main router is located in the living room and creates a wifi hotspot, call it X. I've created an additional wifi hotspot in my bedroom, call it Y, using two powerline adaptors.\nHow do I make my MacBook automatically connect to X while I'm in the living room and to Y while I'm in the bedroom. Thanks.\n\nA: OS X will connect to the Wi-Fi network with the strongest signal, although it won't switch immediately between networks to avoid disruption to the connection.\nYou can alleviate this by having the same SSID for both networks, which will cause OS X to see them as a single network and switch between them automatically.\n", "Q: Where does Screensaver store images? I have only used iPhoto a couple of times by accident (preferring one of the many alternatives).  Each time, I carefully removed those images from iPhoto to the iPhoto trashcan and then emptied the iPhoto trash. Consequently, all the iPhoto sections appear empty:\n\nBut when I look at the screensaver, pictures show up when one of the iPhoto directories is selected (the directories can't be deleted in any way I know).\n\nI'm assuming that the images were copied into a screensaver cache (or maybe a link was created). Where are these screen saver images stored?\nBTW, I'm still running Snow Leopard on a beautiful 4gig iMac. Thanks!\n\nA: After scrounging around in plist files (thank you find and grep!), I found the beginnings of an answer, but I'm still a little confused.\nIt seems that those pesky images have been lingering around (renamed, of course) in the following directory:\n~/Pictures/\nDeleted them, and now when selecting any of the iPhoto portions of Screensaver, I get the appropriate error message:\n\n-Yeah, that's the ticket!\nI hope others will have more details, so I'll wait a couple of days before accepting an answer.\n\nA: This question remains oddly unanswered. My best guess is the iPod Photo Cache (in iPhoto, Aperture packages) ... but then it needs something different for Photos.app.\n", "Q: Second chance at icloud upload? If photos are not automatically uploaded to icloud due to some transient error (environmental or otherwise), does icloud try again? Or do they get just one shot and if that doesn't work, they don't upload?\nThe Apple Genius just told me that they get just one shot and if that doesn't work, I have to do it manually.\n\nA: If the photos are unable to be uploaded to Photo Stream, they will be attempted to be uploaded again at the next available time. There's no 'one chance'—it'll try as many times as necessary until it succeeds or other circumstances make it not necessary to upload them.\n", "Q: where is modprobe in Mavericks? I am unable to find modprobe in Mavericks.  Has it been removed?  Is it part of a package I haven't installed?\n\nA: Could you explain what exactly you mean by \"modprobe\"?\nThe program usually referred to as \"modprobe\" is a Linux-specific program. It is not available for OS X, as it doesn't make any sense there.\nIf you want comparable functionality on OS X, you want to look at a program such as kextload instead.\n\nA: it's no modprobe on mac, the equivalence is kextutil.\n", "Q: What are good bi-directional, real-time synchronization utilities between Mac local folder and web server? I have an iMac that is connected to my local network (and, subsequently, the Internet) that has a folder named DocShare. \nI have a web server hosted off-site through a hosting company, with a similar folder called Online DocShare that hosts an online repository of files that would be related to the DocShare folder on my iMac. This server supports WebDAV, (S)FTP, SSH, etc. for file transfer.\nI would love to find a way to have those two folders, one locally on my iMac and one on my server, synchronize so that anytime I upload a file to the local DocShare, it will appear on my Online DocShare, and vice-versa. It would be great if changes to files could be reflected, and if I deleted/modified/created a file on either side, it would reflect on the opposite folder. \nSo, it would be real-time syncing with a constant connection to the web server, or a scheduled sync process every time interval. So far, I have found a handful of programs for Windows, but none that do this for Mac. \nIf possible, I would love to see it in a GUI, with a possible command-line add-on (not necessarily command-line exclusively). Please let me know what possible options I have, or if I'm all washed up and there isn't anything that does this sort of thing.\n\nA: Unison is my go-to tool for a bi-directional file sync. (Mac binaries are available on a contributor's site.) I tend to think of it as a more interactive, configurable, and bi-directional version of rsync. Since it's a good *nix citizen, it can be automated via your favorite method. It's open-source and has ports to major OS platforms.\nUnfortunately, Unison is no longer under active development, which may or may not be an issue for you. (I think the last time I used it was under 10.6.) But, it does fit your requirements nicely:\n\n\n*\n\n*It handles bi-directional sync and works great on large files and data sets.\n\n*It can run in a completely automated way or interactively (where your review and confirm every change).\n\n*It runs over SSH.\n\n*GUI and CLI interfaces are available. (FWIW, the Mac GUI version, while nice/convenient, was always slightly flaky for me.)\n\n*Its end-user documentation is excellent and thorough.\n\n*It has configuration options for a multitude of use cases.\n\n*It has a design principle of leaving things in a Good State at all times, which makes it easier to recover should the connection be lost at any time.\n\n\nAnd here's the main selling point for using it (for me, at least):\nFor remote SSH targets, it logs into the remote machine, runs a separate copy of Unison there to scan for changes, and then reconciles the state with your local machine to only transmit the bits (or bytes :-)) that differ, much like rsync does. This makes it very efficient with bandwidth, and it's also able to maintain caches of its file index on each side to make subsequent scans faster. For large data sets, this is a huge deal.\nThere are other Mac-specific tools for file synchronization, but, IIRC, they tend to assume that the filesystem is local, and are either very inefficient with bandwidth or very presumptuous about file \"changes\" (metadata, actual data) on large remote files / data sets.\nUnison worked the way I needed it to, was reliable, and made me confident in using it due to its great documentation. Thank you, Benjamin C. Pierce!\n\nA: Transmit provides an Automator action that synchronizes a local folder with a folder on your server. Combine that with folder actions and you should be set, unless I'm reading the question wrong. Transmit supports WebDAV and (S)FTP. \n", "Q: Water damaged Iphone 5S I have an IPhone 5S that I dropped and rolled into a puddle. Although I picked it up quickly and left it in rice all night the screen turned red (the screen isn't broken). I did some research and they said it might be water damaged. I checked the detection sticker by the sim card and it was white, but I know that there are two other indicators on the inside of the phone. I have to replace it and I'd rather not tell them that my phone fell into water because I'm worried they might not do it. My question is will apple open up my phone to check the sensors on the inside or do they just replace your phone without opening it. \n\nA: My 4s went through the washing machine. It was totally wrecked. And, yes, the screen turned fluorescent Peptobismal pink. Because of lawsuits in Australia showing that the water sensor can be turned pink by humidity, Apple now allows repair/replacements for water damaged items.

One of them is a 8gb gskill  stick, and the other is a 4gb Samsung stick. I rarely use more than 8gb of RAM, however it does happen on occasion.\nI would think that it would be best for me to fill the entire 8GB stick first, and then load data onto the 4GB stick if the 8 overflows. This said, I'm not sure if it's possible to load the sticks \"one and then the other\" like this, or if it would be beneficial.\nIs the order that info is loaded into RAM determined by the slot that the stick is in? If so, which slot (top or bottom) should I stick my 8GB stick into in order to make sure that it's used before the 4gb stick?\n\nA: Typically you want to install memory in pairs (i.e. two 8 GB \"sticks\" or 4 GB \"sticks\") to make use of something called the dual-channel memory interface. What that in essence means from your perspective is that the computer can use two memory modules at once, one in each \"channel,\" if they are matched. That gives better performance than using one and then the other.\nThe way Mac OS X works, your computer will use all of the available RAM when it can to cache things that it might need later--even if you don't need them in RAM right at the moment.

F3 and Cmd+F3 are two useful shortcuts on a Mac. What is the purpose of Shift+F3 and Shift+Cmd+F3?\nThey seem to do the exact same thing as F3 and Cmd+F3, but perform the animation much slower. What is the practical purpose for this?\n\nA: The shift modifier has been around for most animated sequences since at least Panther (10.3).  I don't know that there was ever an official reason given but it's widely assumed that it was built in at the request of Steve Jobs in order for him to highlight Expose' as he announced it to the world at the 2003 World Wide Developers Conference. You can see this announcement here, with the slow motion effect being used for the first time around the 2:00 min mark.\nMac OS X Panther - Expose demo\nGiven the crowd's reaction I think it's clear why Apple didn't remove it from the final version.  It's always been one of those little easter eggs that Mac users use to impress their PC using friends.\nSo there you go, no practical purpose, just a bit of fun for Apple.  You can also use shift to slow down most functions that have an animation.  Minimizing windows, opening Mission Control, etc.\n", "Q: How can I map a Service's Keyboard Shortcut on the Command Line?

I put it back on and it seems to work but the key pops out often. My concern is not with the key cap, I'm worried about the hinge. How can I tell the hinge is not broken? How can I know if I didn't break it either?\n\nA: In researching your question, I discovered that you can purchase individual replacement MacBook Air keyboard keys, specified as manufactured by Apple.\nHope this helps.\nBut to answer your question, I would acquire a known good key hinge to examine and compare to the key hinge in question.

I want my bash prompt to change depending on external conditions.\nHere is excerpt from the bash manual:\nPROMPT_COMMAND: If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt.\n\nPS1: The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and used as the primary prompt string.\n\nIn my .bash_profile I have following:\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n ┏━━━[$(date +%H:%M)]\"\nexport PS1=\"━━[\\t]━━━┓\\n\\$ \"\n\nHere is what I see in terminal:\n┏━━━[03:46]━━[03:46:52]━━━┓\n$ cd ..\n┏━━━[03:46]━━[03:51:37]━━━┓\n$\n\nAs you can see, PROMPT_COMMAND doesn't get executed more than once, and remains static forever. \nHow can I have it executed \"prior to issuing each prompt\", as stated in the manual?\nI'm running Mac OS X 10.9.3\necho $BASH_VERSION\n3.2.51(1)-release\n\nA: Your date call got evaluated when you set PROMPT_COMMAND so it is forever stuck at the  time that you ran:\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n ┏━━━[$(date +%H:%M)]\"\n\nTry defining a function instead and assigning that to PROMPT_COMMAND:\nfunction prompt_command() {\n    PS1=\"┏━━━[$(date +%H:%M)]━━[\\t]━━━┓\\n\\$ \"\n}\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=prompt_command\n\nYou can also use \\@ for the current time in 12-hour AM/PM format in your prompt.

I have a Mac Mini running 10.9.3 with two ethernet connections (1 ethernet/1 thunderbolt ethernet) going to a netgear 5 port switch. That switch has one cable going to an 8 port switch which connects to my AirPort Extreme.\nI created a link aggregation with the two ethernet connections on the Mac and Activity Monitor is reporting 4.5-4.9 MB/s receiving data.\nHowever, before I added the thunderbolt the best I could get is 1.4MB/s.\nI have a bit of understanding on networks, but this stumped me. How am I getting more than double the download speed?\nJust because I'm tied to one switch with dual NICs, the rest of the path is a single cable. \nThe files being downloaded are from the same server on the Internet.\n\nA: In all likelihood, the variation in speed you're seeing is happening due to congestion on your connection to the internet, not because of your home network setup. Even the Early 2005 Mac Minis could theoretically manage speeds of 12.5 MB/s, with a real-world throughput somewhere around 10 MB/s. The first Intel-based Mac Minis could handle 10x that.\nUnless you notice the speed reliably changes based on whether or not you are connected over Thunderbolt, I'd assume the speed is actually varying because either the server you are downloading from is overloaded, or your internet connection is.

The benefits are huge. The A7 is up to twice as fast\n  as the previous-generation system at CPU tasks, and up to twice as\n  fast at graphics tasks, too. \n\n—Phil Schiller, Apple keynote at 4\n Infinite Loop on September 10, 2013\n(source: Wikipedia)\nSince Memory is only 1GB for \"iPhone 5S\" then\nHow is 64 bit CPU faster than 32 bit CPU?\nI heard that, in desktop enviroment, to ultilise 64 bit architecture we need more than 4GB memory.\nVery confused?\n\nA: This covers pretty much everything you need to know about benefits of Apple switching to ARM64.\nhttps://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html\ntl;dr conclusion/answer from the link\n\nIt's also important to point out the things that \"64-bit\" does not refer to, as there's a lot of confusion in this area as well. In particular, \"64-bit\" does not include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Physical RAM address size. The number of bits used to actually talk to RAM (and therefore the amount of RAM the hardware can support) is decoupled from the question of CPU bitness. ARM CPUs have ranged from 26 bits to 40 bits, and this can be changed independently from the rest.\n  \n*Data bus size. The amount of data fetched from RAM or cache is likewise decoupled. Individual CPU instructions may request a certain amount of data, but the amount of data actually fetched can be independent, either by splitting the fetch into smaller parts, or fetching more than is necessary. The iPhone 5 already fetches data from memory in 64-bit chunks, and chunk sizes of up to 192 bits exist in the PC world.\n  \n*Anything related to floating-point. FPU register size and internal design is independent, and ARM CPUs have had 64-bit FPU registers since well before ARM64.\n  \n  \n  \"64-bit\" A7 is not just a marketing gimmic, but neither is it an amazing breakthrough that enables a new class of applications. The truth, as happens often, lies in between.\nThe simple fact of moving to 64-bit does little. It makes for slightly faster computations in some cases, somewhat higher memory usage for most programs, and makes certain programming techniques more viable. Overall, it's not hugely significant.\nThe ARM architecture changed a bunch of other things in its transition to 64-bit. An increased number of registers and a revised, streamlined instruction set make for a nice performance gain over 32-bit ARM.\nApple took advantage of the transition to make some changes of their own. The biggest change is an inline retain count, which eliminates the need to perform a costly hash table lookup for retain and release operations in the common case. Since those operations are so common in most Objective-C code, this is a big win. Per-object resource cleanup flags make object deallocation quite a bit faster in certain cases. All in all, the cost of creating and destroying an object is roughly cut in half. Tagged pointers also make for a nice performance win as well as reduced memory use.\n\ntl;dr tl;dr\n\n\n*\n\n*RAM(Memory) is decoupled from CPU bitness and has no play in it's performance\n\n*64-bit does not give 2x boost by itself\n\n*Due to transition to 64-bit Apple managed introduce some clever ways to improve performance\n\n", "Q: How to set up dragging on trackpad?

World phone means it can use for any network in the world whether CDMA or GSM.\nIf they can't make Worl Phone, then at least they should create 2 models only. 1 for GSM & 1 for CDMA.\nHowever, surprisingly, iPhone 5s has so many different models. It has 5 different models for GSM? \nso \nDoes that also mean 5 different iphone 5s with 5 different hardwares?\nLikewise, it has 2 different models for CDMA.\nWhy it has so many different models for the same network. Before that they only have 1 or 2 or max 3 models (iPhone 5).\nThe big question.\nWhat if you buy the wrong model (even for the same network)? For example, I am a user & I just roughly know that my carrier using GSM, then:\nHow do I know which model (A1533, A1457, A1518, A1528, A1530) to chose?\nVery confused? or Apple is trying to confuse the ones who buy the unlocked phone so that they can make more $$ from contract with carrier?\nHow to make sure I buy the right one.\n\nA: This is only a problem if you are buying the phone (unlocked) in another country from the one you want to use it in.\nIf you are buying the phone in the same country that you intend to use it, then all you have to do is see which model of phone is sold by the carrier with which you intend to use the phone, and then buy that same model.\nIf you are in a different country, ask someone to visit a shop in the country where you intend to use the phone, and check the models sold for your intended carrier.\nI suspect that the real reason is not to somehow punish and confuse potential customers (they really don't want you to buy the wrong one, despite how it feels to you now), but is more to do with available chipsets for the various LTE bands.\n\nA: In a word, the problem is 4G. There are simply too many different 4G frequency bands for any one phone to support them all -- the iPhone 4s doesn't support 4G at all, and so it doesn't have this problem. The iPhone 5s has to have different models that support the frequencies used in different parts of the world.\nIf you don't care about 4G and just want GSM or CDMA, then this shouldn't matter to you. You can just buy any GSM or CDMA model, and it will work just as well as the iPhone 4s GSM or CDMA model.\nIf you do care about 4G, then look at this page and pick the model that supports the 4G network that you plan to use it on.\n", "Q: AppleScript to save active Microsoft Word document IFF there is one I use this with Keyboard Maestro to automatically save the front-most document in Microsoft Word whenever Word deactivates:\ntell application \"Microsoft Word\"\n    if it is running then\n        save active document\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThis works great unless there is not an active document, in which case it throws an error.\nI know I could ignore the error, but I would rather not.\nI would like to know if there’s a proper AppleScript way to say something like “If active document exists, then save it.”\nI tried Googling but only found this (what I have now).\n\nA: You need to query Word for the count of document objects – active document is just a convenience shortcut to the frontmost one in that list. Unluckily, Word’s somewhat peculiar AppleScript implementation does not return an empty list object when there is no open document, but missing value (AppleScript’s take on nil) instead. Taking that into account, the following function queries Word for open documents:\non hasDocument()\n  tell application \"Microsoft Word\"\n    every document is not missing value\n  end tell\nend\n\n– put that in front of your script and change your conditional to if it is running and my hasDocument() and you should be fine.\n", "Q: Show hidden files in SELECT folder only How do I show hidden files in one directory only?

I setup a dualshock 4 (PS4) controller to work with my Mac Mini for XBMC, which can play games on emulators like SNES9x. The issue I'm having though, is that when I want to quit the game/emulator that I'm playing, it requires a mouse and a keyboard. So what I would like to do ideally, is take an applescript that I have, which terminates the current emulator and bind it to the \"PlayStation\" button on the controller so when I'm ready, I can quit the current game without having to use a mouse and keyboard. At the same time, it's necessary that every other button on the controller can continue to be mapped normally to buttons in the emulator.\n\nA: Whilst I don't have a PS4 controller to test this on, you should be able to use Keyboard Maestro's Device Key action to run AppleScript or any other action.\n\n", "Q: DoNotTrack Safari extension by Abine I'm desperate to uninstall the DoNotTrackMe extension from Abine.com.

If the mail was sent to A and B, and Mail is set up to check A & B, there is no way to distinguish which one is primary, without giving Mail some sort of hint. \nOne such way is to make sure the inbox of a specific account is highlighted in the folder view on the left. \n\nA: I ws going to make this a comment about SamH's reply, but I don't have a high enough reputation:\nI'm not sure why SamH's answer wasn't upvoted, because he's right.\nI've included some images in case they help explain his answer graphically—sorry for the blurring, but the point should be fairly clear in each.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you highlight \"Inbox\" and check a message addresses to you and Jane Doe, the response will come from either the Primary account holder; or the one that's first alphabetically—alphabetically when neither recipient is Primary has been my experience, anyhow.\n\n*If you highlight your Inbox in the list at left (when the Inbox list is expanded) and reply to the e-mail, it will come from you automatically.\n\n*If you highlight Jane Doe's Inbox in the list at left, the reply to the message will come from her.\nI hope the images help, but if you came looking for an answer to this issue, please upvote SamH's response as it is completely accurate.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Put Macbook Pro to sleep with HDMI connected to External Monitor? I have conneceted my Macbook Pro (Late 2011) to my recently bought 27'' monitor with an HDMI cable. I have done all the settings so when I close the lid, I can still use my external monitor without any problems.\nThe issue however is that my Macbook Pro heats a lot when I do that and I also use two devices and therefore have to pay bills for two devices as well. \nIs there any possible way of putting my Macbook Pro into sleep mode so that I can ONLY use my external monitor without my Macbook Pro being 'on' (sleep mode)?\nExtra information: \n\n\n*\n\n*I use a bluetooth keyboard conneceted with a cable to charge\n\n*I use a bluetooth mouse conneceted with a cable to charge \n\n\nBoth, mouse and keyboard can be used when my Macbook Pro's lid is closed.\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro can't go to sleep completely as you're using it, however, since you're using it in  \"Clamshell mode\" (with the lid shut) the internal display will have been powered down (you can tell as the logo on the lid will no longer be lit).\nIf you want to put the machine to sleep while it's in Clamshell mode, just press Ctrl-Eject on the keyboard you're using and the prompt for putting it to sleep will appear (the specific key sequence is Ctrl-Eject followed by 'S').

Previously on OS X Server could be virtualized and even then, only in narrow circumstances. With Lion you could virtualize the non-Server OS X version.\nThe Mavericks EULA maintains the Lion virtualization clause. Specifically it says:\n\n(iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or\n  instances of the Apple  Software within virtual operating system\n  environments on each Mac Computer you own  or control that is already\n  running the Apple Software, for purposes of: (a) software \n  development; (b) testing during software development; (c) using OS X\n  Server; or (d)  personal, non-commercial use.\n\nSo you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only virtualize on Apple hardware (which you say you're doing);\n\n*Only virtualize non-Server for development, testing or \"personal, non-commercial use\" otherwise you have to use the Server version of OS X (which is a $20 add-on to Mavericks from the App Store)\n\n\nFall within the bounds of the above-mentioned restrictions and yes, you can virtualize OS X in your ESXi environment.\n\nA: Legally you cannot install OS X on a non-apple branded computer without writen permisson from Apple. You didn't specify which version of OS X you would installing but I'm assuming Mavericks, see the licensing agreement section 2(A). I'm sure there is similar wording in most of there software licensing agreements.\n\nA: As others have noted, it's legal to install one OS X virtual machine on Apple hardware. According to VMware, it's possible to install Mavericks in ESXi 5.5. \n(Note that OS X has some secret sauce which prevents it from booting unmodified on VMs which are not hosted on Macs. For example, an OS X VM will shut down if you try to start it on a Windows host.)\n\nA: It's a limitation set in the esxi local.sh corefile. There is an unlocker available to permit OS X on non-Apple hardware, but it will break the EULA licence terms. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't start since deleting various files I removed some \".dylib\" files because BitDefender Virus Scan told me so.

Boot Camp or Wine?\nThank you in advance!\nEDIT\nWhat about WineBottler? http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/\n\nA: I'd recommend WineBottler; I have about 30 apps and games that work great with Wine. A few pointers though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the Wine Application Database for various apps. This shows what version of Wine, what winetricks you need and what workarounds may be required.\nDisclaimer: I'm a super maintainer\n\n*Check the official system requirements for the program/game. For older games, this will state which version of .NET or other framework is required—make sure you select the same version in WineBottler to be installed in the new prefix.\n\n*For programs that don't work, you can create a blank prefix with various frameworks installed and try combinations of winetricks without needing a new prefix each time.\n\nA: I have used CrossOver, PlayOnMac, WineBottler & wine (directly from Terminal).\nAll of these use wine, but I would strongly recommend CrossOver, even though it isn't free. If you don't feel like spending any money, I would recommend either PlayOnMac or WineBottler as they are pretty similar in functionality.\nWineskin is also another alternative to look at.\n\nA: If you're just playing casual games and don't need super-great FPS, Wine is the way to go. You don't need to buy Windows that way, and since it's free, it's definitely worth trying out first.\nThe Big Fish games are also available on Mac and the system requirements are even lower.

I have the option to eject or ignore the message, and either option does not solve the problem. Can't use the usb ports without getting this message.\n\nA: From your question it is not clear what you put into those USB ports. Memory sticks appear to the system as a disk, so the message you quoted might be caused by a memory stick that had been formatted in a file system your Mac does not know (possibly from a Linux computer?).\nIf you want to widen your possibilities, you might consider installing OSXFUSE.

Make sure not to allow any water to seep into the device, especially through openings like ports and jacks.\nRefer to Apple's cleaning instructions for more in-depth explanations.\n\nA: I always flip mine over and rub it on my jeans - but the act of putting it my pocket is usually all the wiping it needs. Yes, it could get a scratch if my jeans had grit on or in the pocket (though it never has). \nWhen really greasy fingers or food spills are on a screen I will use ammonia-based window cleaner, methanol (camera lens cleaning kit), ethanol (methylated spirits - same thing in the optician's spray basically), kitchen spray, isopropyl alcohol or just about anything else that will shift grease. \nNothing lasts forever and life is too short to be precious about an iPod.\n\nA: I always use LCD cleaning spray.\n\nA: I bought a box of 200 pre-moistened lens cleaning wipes. I always throw a few in my bag so I can clean screens whenever needed. The isopropyl alcohol cleans very well and evaporates almost instantly, so no residue or streaks. \n\nA: I clean with wet napkin then with dry napkin. Works fine for me\n\nA: A microfibre cloth works great for the iPhone/iPod/iPad screens. If you've purchased a Mac, the cloth that came with that works great too so you don't have to purchase a separate one.\n\nA: This is indeed very important questions as it encompasses the very basic human affinity towards cleanliness.\nA considerate individual shall always keep their iTissues handy for such an occasion.

My MacBook Pro logic board needed to be replaced, so I borrowed an MBA from a coworker.\nI restored the MBA from Time Machine to get back to work. When I was done, I removed my user account tied to my iCloud account, and gave it back. They didn't have much of anything on it, so he didn't care if it was restored to previous state (so he didn't have a Time Machine backup for this MBA).\nMy MBP was Mavericks, but their laptop was Mountain Lion. I offered to do the OS X update for them (as it was free) when I restored, but now I'm wondering if that was a bad idea.\nHe said that they are getting an iCloud prompt for my account when the App Store is attempting to do updates. They've signed out of everything they can find (system preferences, app store, iTunes), but they can't change it.\nAny quick fix for this or do I need to pick up the laptop from them and do some sort of factory reset?\n\nA: Apps downloaded from the App Store are tied to the Apple ID they were purchased under, and can only be updated with that Apple ID. From what you're describing, you must've installed some apps (licensed to your Apple ID) on his Mac while you were using it.\nThe simplest solution is to figure out which apps are licensed to you, delete them from his Mac (you can simply use the Finder to drag them from the /Applications folder to the trash), and then (if appropriate) purchase/download them under his Apple ID.\n\nA: Delete the app and reset it from settings by going to general and go all the way down and see reset and click settings\n", "Q: Why do I get different Available/Used spaces with Disk Info and df? I have an early '13 MBP running Mavericks.

What is the correct value and what is the reason why?\n\nA: df is using Gi = Gibibytes, and \"Get Info\" is using GB = Gigabytes. \n\nA: Do you have Time Machine backups turned on? If so, the difference may be due to space used for \"local snapshots\" (essentially, backups to the local disk when your real backup disk is not available). Local snapshots are automatically deleted when the space is needed for something else (actually, it starts purging them when the volume reaches 80% full), so the Finder treats them as free space. du, on the other hand, sees them as used space (as do Disk Utility and System Information).\nTo find out if this is what's going on, take a look in System Information: From the Apple Menu, choose \"About This Mac\", then click \"More Info\", then select the Storage tab, and look for a light purple (\"Backups\") band on the usage chart. If it's around 47GB, this is the source of the difference.\nIf you want to disable this feature, you can use the Terminal command sudo tmutil disablelocal -- but I recommend leaving it enabled, as it does provide some useful protection against accidental deletion/file damage/etc when your real backup is not available.\nEDIT: As @chillin pointed out, there's an additional source of confusion: df and the Finder are using different units to report the sizes. df is using Gibibytes (=1,073,741,824 bytes), while the Finder is using Gigabytes (=1,000,000,000 bytes). If the Finder had reported in GiB, it would've said Capacity: 232.96 GiB, Available: 166.41 GiB, Used: 66.55 GiB. So there was actually about 52 GiB used for the local snapshots.\n\nA: Edit: \nSee Gordon Davisson's answer before going taking these steps.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Attempt to reindex the volume\nIf that fails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot in OS X Recovery. Select your startup volume from Disk Utility > Repair Disk. Observe if any FS errors are found/fixed, and reboot normally. Subsequently, see if the discrepancy is gone.\n\n\nA: chillin's answer is absolutely correct.\nGi = 1024^3 bytes\nGB = 1000^3 bytes\nIf you do the math (converting from 250.14 GB to Gi), it would be\n250.14 * (1000^3) / (1024^3) = 232.83\nExactly 233 Gi.\n\nA: Trash.\nNo one has mentioned trash, which is just another directory to \"df\" and \"du\" but is often, confusingly, mixed in with how Finder reports free space. Did you clear trash and re-check?  \n", "Q: PC as Bluetooth Airplay receiver Well, the title pretty much speaks for itself. I would like to stream my Mac's music to my PC over Bluetooth.\nIt appears this isn't supported by default (or at least my devices are reporting it's not).\nIs there some way to do this? Does it require an extra application perhaps? There are a lot of solutions to do so over wifi but i would prefer bluetooth...\n\nA: Found the solution myself.\nFor some reason, after pairing, you still need to manually connect.\nThis functionality however is completely unavailable in the preferences window and can only be accessed using the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar.\nOnce there you simply have to select the paired device to stream your music to and choose connect.\nAfter doing so the mac will automatically open iTunes so you can test your newly made connection.\nNote: this can only be done on the mac, there is no way to request this type of connection from the PC.\n", "Q: How to move file from one users account to another? Permission denied. I'm trying to move the file of a virtual machine from one users account to the other. So basically I want to move /Users/joe/Win7.vm to /Users/jane/Win7.vm but I can't figure out how to do it through Finder because I can't get to the root directory (/). I tried moving it using the mv command in Terminal and it said permission denied. Is tried sudo mv but it just said \"sorry\". I also tried changing its permission (chmod) but it wouldn't let me (and when I tried sudo chmod, it literally said \"sorry\"). \nI'm logged in as administrator. \n\nA: Its a permissions issue. To resolve simply, first copy the file to /Users/Shared/, then copy again from there, then try to troubleshoot your permissions issues afterwards. You are logged in as administrator, yet you still are lacking the authority to escalate to root or change permissions, and that is odd. Even as admin, you would still need root access to move a file belonging to one user to another users' account. In Terminal, try sudo bash and enter your password when prompted. To use mv command, the syntax is mv /path/to/origin/file /path/to/destination/directory/\nAlso, changing permissions with chmod doesn't change ownership. You use chown for that.\n\nA: A much simpler option exists via /Users/[a username]/Public/Drop\\ Box.  \nSimply drop the file(s) into this folder in the receiving user's homedir and you are good to go after logging in as said, receiving user.\n", "Q: Error during WebSocket handshake: Status line contains embedded null (using livereload, node-inspector, and karma) Whenever I run something in my Terminal that requires a websocket to a browser (livereload, node-inspector, karma), I get the following console error \"Error during WebSocket handshake: Status line contains embedded null.\" Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Lame, looks like it was my accountability software x3watch. \n", "Q: Looking for a text editor with specific syntax highlighting features I'm a pc guy, but I have a programming student who's got a mac. We have been using TextMate, but there are a few features missing that I either can't find, or that are not available in TextMate.\nIn my beloved Notepad++ I have the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*vertical gridlines, that help you see how far indented you are\n\n*when putting your cursor next to a pair of brackets or inside an html tag, the matching bracket or tag will be highlighted, in the case of curly braces the aforementioned gridlines will even be highlighted (so if you have consistently indented code, you'll just have to scan down the highlighted, dotted line, and you'll find the matching bracket)\n\n*when highlighting a word (which is quick by double clicking on it) all other instances of that same word will be highlighted (where else did i use that function/variable? did i name it consistently?)\n\n*Commenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[k]\n\n*Un-Commenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[shift]+[k]\n\n*Indenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[tab]\n\n*Un-Indenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[shift]+[tab]\n\n*the ability to chose how to interpret the file (what language) textmate's interpretation is quite buggy... somethimes you'll open a file and it'll be all white even though it's clearly a .css file or so.\n\n*function completion, such as parameter hints, closing html tags automatically, and completing brackets, would also be helpful. I love hot notepad++ shows you when you type a variable what variable names you have already used in the document.\n\n\nTextmate's handling of brackets and quotations rocks: it adds the matching pair for you, but wont advance the cursor, so if it's in your muscle memory to do them at the same time, it won't waste your time. and you can highlight a word and hit quotes or brackets, and it'll wrap the word in brackets. So those would be a bonus, but it's nothing I miss when using Notepad++, however the combination of lacking the above is frustrating.\n\nDoes anybody know a free program for Mac with these features?\nAnd while you are at it, could you please point out how to activate and use these features?\nFor example I know TextMate has a way to indent, but the key combination it gives you makes no sense to me...\nThanks for any suggestions!\n\nA: Sublime Text\nThere are some things worth paying for in life and a solid text editor is, in my opinion, one of them. If it's the tool you use every day, what's a few dollars to ensure that tool is high quality? For me, that editor worth paying for is Sublime Text. I'm still on 2, but 3 is a pretty stable beta and can be had for free for the time being. Both 2 and, when it leaves beta, 3 can be \"evaluated\" indefinitely if the price and paying for quality software really turns you off.\nThe upside to Sublime is it has a long and illustrious with a great community behind it. It has an awesome package management system in Package Control that lets you add a ton of features very quickly and easily.\nTo address your specific feature requests...\n\nvertical gridlines, that help you see how far indented you are\n\nYes. Add:\n\"draw_indent_guides\": true\n\nto your preferences file.\n\nbracket matching and tag matching when you're inside a tag\n\nThe BracketHighligher extension does this and more. There's a snazzy screen shot on its Package Control page that shows off all the ways it can highlight things out of the box.\nYou can find my Sublime preferences file here which has most of things you desire enabled in it already.\n\nwhen highlighting a word (which is quick by double clicking on it) all other instances of that same word will be highlighted\n\nSublime calls this Multiple Selection. Select a word and then press Ctrl+Command+G or Cmd-D to select all occurrences of the word in the file. Typing will replace all occurrences simultaneously. You can do a lot more than that with Sublime. See the aforementioned page for other multiple selection ninja moves you can do.\n\nCommenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[k]\n\nHighlight the block and press Command-/ to toggle comments on and off for the block. You can combine this with multiple selection mentioned above to comment out non-contiguous lines.\n\nUn-Commenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[shift]+[k]\n\nIt's Command-/ in Sublime to toggle comments which is easier to remember than an 'add comment' and a separate 'remove comment' action if you ask me. If you don't like the short cut you can reassign key bindings freely in Sublime to map the actions to a preferred combination.\n\nIndenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[tab]\n\nThat works exactly how you want: select the lines, TAB to indent, Shift-TAB to un-indent.\n\nUn-Indenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[shift]+[tab]\n\nIt's just Shift-TAB in Sublime.\n\nthe ability to chose how to interpret the file (what language)\n\nYou can override Sublime's language guess using the View > Syntax... menu. Pick the language you want it to be instead of the one Sublime guessed. Sublime's guessing is much better than TextMate's though IMO.\n\nfunction completion, such as parameter hints, closing html tags automatically, and completing brackets, would also be helpful.\n\nAbsolutely -- they're called Snippets in Sublime's parlance. It ships with a bunch of defaults for some common languages like CSS, HTML, Ruby and Python that are useful. You can add your own snippets and you can find more language support and snippets in Package Control.\n\nA: Atom\nAtom is the new kid on the block. Completely free and open source, it's a text editor that started out as a closed-source project at GitHub but is now being extended by folks around the world. It has grown in popularity and capabilities very quickly. It's still a bit young so it's changing rapidly and there are some rough edges, but it's showing a lot of promise and you sure can't beat the speed at which issues get addressed in the project when they do arise.\nThey borrowed a lot from TextMate and Sublime so it would feel familiar to people -- both of those editors were and are very popular with OS X-based developers. Smart to start on the shoulders of giants and try standing from there, right?\nHere is a great comparison between Atom and Sublime Text.\nTo address your specific feature requests...\n\nvertical gridlines, that help you see how far indented you are\n\nYes. In the Core Settings preferences window, scroll to the bottom and check Show Indent Guide to see guides.\n\nbracket matching and tag matching when you're inside a tag\n\nIt has the atom/bracket-matcher plugin that ships with it by default.\n\nwhen highlighting a word (which is quick by double clicking on it) all other instances of that same word will be highlighted\n\nYes. Highlight a word or phrase and press Cmd-D and it will select all instances of that pattern in the file.\n\nCommenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[k]\n\nHighlight the block and press Command-/ to toggle comments on and off for the block. You can combine this with multiple selection mentioned above to comment out non-contiguous lines.\n\nUn-Commenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[shift]+[k]\n\nIt's Command-/ in Atom to toggle comments which is easier to remember than an 'add comment' and a separate 'remove comment' action if you ask me. If you don't like the short cut you can reassign key bindings freely in Atom to map the actions to a preferred combination.\n\nIndenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[tab]\n\nThat works exactly how you want: select the lines, TAB to indent, Shift-TAB to unindent.\n\nUn-Indenting multiple lines of text by highlighting and hitting [strg]+[shift]+[tab]\n\nIt's just Shift-TAB in Atom.\n\nthe ability to chose how to interpret the file (what language)\n\nPress Ctrl-Shift-l to opent the file type selector and reassign the language or file type for a specific file.\n\nfunction completion, such as parameter hints, closing html tags automatically, and completing brackets, would also be helpful.\n\nI'm sorry. I'm not sure how you do this and I can't find any great documentation on it. Maybe someone can annotate the answer? I'd be surprised if Atom couldn't do this.\n\nA: TextMate's controls are configurable, and they're dependent on separate macro \"bundles\" for the currently active language, but the standards are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cmd-/ for commenting and uncommenting selected blocks\n\n*Cmd-] for indenting selected blocks and Cmd-[ for dedenting\n\n*Esc to autocomplete a word, but it works strictly by looking for the nearest matching word in the current document; it doesn't know anything about the current language's standard library, or words in other documents.\n\n\nAt the bottom of the TextMate screen you should have a footer that tells you the current line and column, the current language (so if it's mistaken about the language, fix it there), how tabs are configured, and so on.\nI believe a .css bundle comes pre-installed, so I'm not sure why it wouldn't auto-identify .css. \n\nA: sublime text should suit most of your needs, also it has tons of plugins that you can use to customize it.\n", "Q: Windows: Why does Bonjour's mdnsNSP.dll inject itself into every process? In Windows, why does Bonjour's mdnsNSP.dll inject itself into every process?\n\nA: Sounds like you are curious about security and privacy. If so, your question should be \"Why does my operating system allow third-party software to become aware of and affect every process?\" or, \"If I care about security and privacy, why am I using Windows?\" \nBonjour is Apple's implementation of zero configuration networking. A very long time ago, and very shrewdly, Microsoft began making its OS and most of its processes, and the file system as well, network aware. Most notably, the file manager Windows Explorer was made network aware, which was also basically the same application as the native web browser, Internet Explorer,  and this change in the behavior of the operating system led to antitrust cases regarding which web browsers shipped with Windows. By now, I imagine, everything running in Windows is probably network aware, and are identified and advertised as 'Services' to the Windows kernel and the network. If so, it makes sense that Bonjour would make itself available to every processes to enable zero configuration networking. \n", "Q: iPhone FTP utility with automatic backup? I am searching for an iPhone utility / application with an FTP client that can do automatic backup without user intervention. More specifically, I'd expect to configure the utility once and specify (somehow) that I want a certain type of file (e.g. photos) backed up automatically, in the background.  As an example, if I specified photo backup, I'd want the new photos to be ftp'ed in the background, shortly after they're created.\nI've searched for hours on the AppStore and already bought two top rated FTP clients. Neither does what I want. Perhaps this is due to a limitation of the iPhone architecture?  If so, I'd be amenable to running a jail-breaked phone, if such application were available.\nAny pointers gratefully appreciated.\nBTW, I've specified FTP rather than than another protocol/service since the goal is to upload photos directly to a host that I control (where the photos will be further processed into a report and sent to a customer).  For this reason, it's important that the photos are moved as fast as they're created and, unlike ITunes/Dropbox/GoogleDrive/etc, they need to move to a computer that I control.  I mention this because IF an application can accomplish the aforementioned task without FTP, that's fine. \n\nA: What you want can be done with Apple's iCloud backup (on your iPhone go to: Settings, iCloud, Storage & Backup, iCloud Backup). But you ask specifically for a whole iPhone backup over FTP.\nYou can also use your WiFi to backup your iPhone via iTunes. To set up Wi-Fi syncing, connect your iOS device to your computer with the included USB cable. Click the Device button in the upper-right corner. (If viewing the iTunes Store, click the Library button first.) If you don't see your device, choose View > Hide Sidebar. In the Summary tab, select \"Sync with this [device] over Wi-Fi.\"\nThere are some good non Apple programs to backup your photo's over the internet (bittorrent sync, Dropbox, Copy for iOS, and much more), but none use old school FTP.\nIf you specifically want FTP, you should jailbreak your iPhone, setup your FTP connection and run a Cron job which syncs every x hours. I would strongly recommend not to go this way, it will eat your battery and FTP is not the correct way to do this, I would greatly suggest rsync over SSH. Or use SFTP. But yet again, I would strongly recommend not to go this way.\nIf you want to drop every photo you make onto an FTP host, you can do this if you setup an OS X device in between. You can use iCloud-Photostream to send the photo's to your photostream. Now, when your mac is running, it will automatically download this stream and store the foto's in ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub. Now you can use any software to start syncing your mac. For example you can create 'Folder actions' to start an FTP upload every time the folder gets a new image.\nAnother possibility is to make the photo from within file-exchange app like Dropbox or bittorrent sync or one of the others. The app will automatically upload your photo's to other devices.\nI would go for the iCloud-Photostream -> Mac -> Client if I had to use it myself. I would go for creating the photo's from within the file-exchange app if I had to explain my mother how to do it. Furthermore, what are you planning to do with your backups? You can not use them to restore your iPhone, you need an iTunes or iCloud backup for that.\n\nA: I wanted something similar for my iphone 12, and I recently bumped upon an app on store called PhotoSync. I have downloaded it and its website specifies how to use FTP option given inside. It should solve your problem\n\nA: Use camera sync. The only problem I found is you have to manually open the app and then it backups your pic to the specified ftp server. \n", "Q: Changing countries makes iTunes unable to locate music I have switched from country A to country B, however all of my music in my library is now unable to be located and comes up with those exclamation marks.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: I assume you use iTunes Match (and haven’t downloaded the music to your library). If the problem is caused not downloading the music, switch back to your original country and download all the music before switching to your preferred country.\nSide Notes: Everything you purchase on iTunes is tied to your Apple ID according to its active country. If you purchase music on Unites States iTunes Store, you won’t be able to download them when you switch to Japan iTunes Store.\nYou can certainly switch between country to download your past purchases, but I suggest to maintain one Apple ID to avoid this complicated process.\n", "Q: Change background color of a folder in Finder I have many white icons in a folder and they are not visible on white background of folder, how can I change background color of a folder in Finder?\n\nA: You can use a color or photo as the background of a Finder window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the window and choose View > As Icons. Pictures and colored\nbackgrounds are visible only when items in a window are viewed as\nicons.\n\n*Choose View > Show View Options.\n\n*Under Background, select either Color or Picture.\nOption  Description Color:   Click the color box and select a\nbackground color.

Time Machine (external hard drive) backed up some files in my Trash folder and I'd like them removed from my backup. I know how to normally remove backed up files from within Time Machine (right click a file and choose Delete Backup), but that method is not working for ~/Trash and ~/.trash in the backups.\nHow do I removed backed up files from the Trash in Time Machine?\n\nA: Time Machine shouldn't be backing up the trash folder(s) under normal circumstances.\nIn any case, you might want to use Terminal command tmutil delete command to delete the offending files.\ntmutil delete /Volumes/DISK/Backups.backupdb/HOST/DATE/Macintosh HD/.Trashes\n\n\nA: Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but Time Machine does not backup the Trash folder by default. Did you modify the exclusions property list to include these folders?\n\nA: The fix to the problem is… it fixed itself. Really. Between posting this problem and trying a solution I had disconnected my backup drive and put my laptop to sleep.\nWhen I reconnected the backup drive later to try @icondaemon's solution, it turned out then that I couldn't find the files in the backup. I was very thorough in checking. Moreover, the Finder/Time Machine was now letting me delete backups of dot files and hidden flag files.\nSo I'm happy now that it's taken care of, but a bit tired and confused since there is no obvious solution.\n", "Q: Submitting apps containing ports of chromium browser or webkit engine in the app store A small doubt here:\nI am building an app which will contain either a custom, modified version of Chromium or a modified version of the webkit rendering engine. \nDoes Apple have a policy of not allowing Chromium/webkit into the apps (I am guessing Apple prefers only Webcore - https://www.webkit.org/blog/114/webcore-rendering-i-the-basics/)? Is there an alternative if yes?\n\nA: WebKit is in fact the only rendering engine allowed into the App Store, but you have to use Apple's preinstalled version, not your own. Relevant bit:\n\nApp Store Review Guidelines §2.17\nApps that browse the web must use the iOS WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript\n\nSo it's possible that, if it doesn't qualify as “browsing the web”, you have a chance at getting past that. Some of the most important parts of WebKit on iPhone are also closed source.\nWebCore, as part of Apple's WebKit, is accepted, but it does not appear possible with these guidelines to modify it, and I think you still have to go through the WebKit framework. Plenty of people use JavaScript with JSCore in the default WebKit.\nThe choice to disallow all other web frameworks is honestly a bit odd, but it looks like you might have to do something besides that; it really depends on what you want to change or add from Chromium/WebKit.\n", "Q: Adding a username alias using the command line How do I add a username alias using the command line?\nI can do it fine using the preferences dialog through the \"Advanced Options\", but I need to do it during an installation script. \nCan someone point me the right way?\n\nA: The information is accessible through dscl.

I do this browsing from my Windows PC. Is there any way I can manage who is a GameCenter Friend while not having physical access to the iPad at the time? Is there maybe a section on the Apple website that allows this, or within iTunes?\n\nA: There is a Mac Game Center app that was added in Mountain Lion, but besides that there is currently no way to access Game Center outside of the iOS app.\nA place to keep an eye on would be iCloud.com. If Apple added a web interface to Game Center it would most likely be added there (/speculation)\n", "Q: iPhone was unable to locate for nearly five hours on find My Iphone app on a synced device.

Apple has an OS X Beta Seed Program, but the site only contains information about how to join, how to send feedback to Apple once you are in, and a rather sparse FAQ.\nDue to the confidentiality of the program:\n\nIs the pre-release software I am installing confidential?\nYes, the pre-release software is Apple confidential information. For example, don’t install the pre-release Apple software on any systems you don't directly control or that you share with others, don’t blog, post screen shots, tweet or publicly post information about the pre-release Apple software, and don't discuss the pre-release Apple software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in the OS X Beta Seed Program.\n\nit is tempting, but impossible to ask questions with any hope of receiving an answer on sites like this. Is there a place that Apple provides for discussion of the program?\n\nA: How you obtain Apple's pre-release software governs which forum Apple provides for discussion and support of the software as well as a place to exercise the ability to discuss the software with others in the pre-release program along with you.\nI'm aware of three mechanisms for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Developer - https://developer.apple.com/programs/\n\n*AppleSeed: Software Customer Seeding - https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/welcome/\n\n*OS X Beta Seed Program - https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\nFor registered developers, you can look over your agreement for details and the proper discussion forums are at https://developer.apple.com/devforums/\nFor the public beta seed, I haven't found the location of that forum publicly disclosed, but I would be surprised if they don't have a place to discuss things there as well in terms of a more specific forum than the main Apple discussions forums.\nI wouldn't try to use the public Apple support communities or this Q&A site for specific questions about pre-release builds or products, but getting a pointer to where these are actually hosted seems fine to host here.\nAnd here - we now don't close beta questions as long as they are specific and otherwise valid questions about Apple products, services and such.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/08/beta-ios-9-and-el-capitan-questions-allowed/\n", "Q: User folder on mac OS is empty, but still uses 60GB of hard drive space I have deleted all the files under User folder, but it still says that it uses ~60GB of space. Real usage is ~2MB. There are no more files to delete. Is there any hidden files i am not aware of. If yes, how i can delete them?\n\nI do not want to delete the user account. I just want to get rid of information that is useless, but I don't want to mess up my Mailbox or other stuff, so I want an advice if it's safe to delete some parts of those folders.\n\nA: Rebuild your Mailbox. You can do it by running Mail, and select Mailbox » Rebuild from menu bar. This’ll remove all the attachments in all your signed in accounts.\nAs for the massive file size in ~/Library/Application Support, you have to figure out which apps taking up the largest space. Run these apps and try to reset the caches with the built-in options or menus. If you still can’t find one, consider remove the largest file (not entire folder).\nTake time to skim through the list and delete folder where apps are no longer installed (usually they’re named after the app name). It’s possible that you didn’t remove apps correctly before.\n\nA: In Yosemite if you use iTunes and have an iPhone - release your older backups - they are categorized as \"other\" storage on your hard drive and if you have a larger iPhone the backups can be 20+ gigs.\n\nA: I was having a similar issue.  I had over 60 GB of \"movies\" that I couldn't find anywhere.  It was actually in my recently deleted album of my photos.  If you double click albums, you should see one that says \"recently deleted\".  There was 57 GB in there.  I permanently deleted them, and problem was solved.\n\nA: The space is most likely being occupied by the various files and folders in ~/Library, which is hidden by default on OS X. You can show the Library folder by navigating to your home folder in Finder, pressing ⌘J and showing the Library folder.\nFurthermore, you can run the following command in your home folder which will list all the files and folders in your home folder, including hidden files and folders, and display their sizes.\ndu -shc .??* *\n\n\nA: Not sure what you trying to accomplish here, and I would not trust the DiskWave.app to be accurate.\nI strongly advise you not to delete hidden files. \nThere is a reason they are hidden.\nIf you must see them in Finder, run the following in Terminal.app:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles 1 && killall Finder\n\nTo reverse that, use this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles 0 && killall Finder\n\n\nA: Well, I had similar issue in my Download folder.\nMany times I got the message 'Startup Disk is almost full'.\nFinder was showing 37 GB in that folder, but, checking each subfolder individually, the size of all was like 10 GB smaller.\nSo, I could not (yet) figure out why it happens, but, I could find out how to fix it.\nThe only matter is the problem may keep showing itself up.\nSo, to fix this, go to 'System Preferences' -> 'Spotlight', then, 'Privacy'.\nClick on the '+' button, and add the disk which contains the 'wrong sized folder'. Hit OK for confirmation.\nReboot your Mac (when I learned about it, this step was not mentioned. I did it on my own, just to make sure).\nAfter the reboot, go back to system 'System Preferences' -> 'Spotlight', then, 'Privacy'. Now, click in a disk you just added, and remove it (using the '-' button).\nAnd it's done the trick.\nPS 1: MacBook Air 2010, OS X v10.8.5 (Mountain Lion), 256 GB SSD \nPS 2: Sorry, I do not remember where I learned it, but, in the worst case, you will lose a bit of time while OS X rebuilds the file indexes to improve spotlight search.\nPS 3: If you realize the spotlight is not searching how should be, it is a signal that above procedure should be executed.\nPS 4: Another tip that may be helpful:\nGo to Disk Utility, select your disk, and hit 'verify disk permissions'. After done, click in 'repair disk permissions'.\n\nA: I had a similar problem - my folder usage was 20GB when I look at my user directory. Use muCommander as root (sudo) and check this folder again. \n\nA: Many many files and folders system hidden. You can show and check your capacity.\nIn Finder show hidden system: View -> Show System Files\nOr you can get information about capacity in your profile user by open Terminal and type:\ndu -shc .??* *\n\n\nA: I had the same issue. I used the terminal command du -shc .??* *\nto show hidden files and looked in the LIBRARY folder in the User folder. Under Application Support was where all the space was being used. A Folder called ILIFEASSETMANAGEMENT .\nThere were a lot of pictures in there. I went into SETTINGS and under iCloud Photos Options , turned off PHOTO STREAM. Bingo..got all my space back.\n\nA: This was killing me too. I resorted to doing a clean reinstall. Not even a simple reinstall (the one where there's no formatting of the hard disk) would get rid of the infamous \"60GB\". Now it hovers around 10GB, but I chose not to use iCloud at all. You turn that on and things start to get out of your control. I prefer Dropbox; at least I know that what I put there is what I'm backing up.\n\nA: I recovered somewhere in the neighbourhood of 80 GB yesterday by running Onyx and removing OS X's file versions which causes a fair amount of bloat well beyond regular cache cleaning.  \nOf course, backup/be careful use at own risk, but:\nhttp://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html\n\nA: \nCulprit --The hidden library folder!\n\nA: There is a nice program for Mac called CCleaner. While I was a Windows user, CCleaner was a great companion, deleting thrash files and cleaning the registry. ^_^ (well, OS X has no registry...)\nI run CCleaner every day, before shutting down my Mac.\nhttps://www.piriform.com/mac/ccleaner\n\nA: Another thing that can eat up a lot of time and disk space is Spotlight, which crawls around looking for things to index.  It can generate a lot of \"unexplained\" disk activity and very large hidden files.  On my system, I drastically reduced the list of things that it was allowed to index, to include only the things I actually need.\n\nA: In my case, The real culprit was 2 .err files under the following path /usr/local/var/mysql/ which were taking about 45 GB and 4 GB respectively.\nAfter deleting this files I immediately recovered around 50 GB of data.\nHope this is of use to someone.\n", "Q: Mail downloads immediately visible when I read appended docs in Mail, it saves each one of them automatically Mail Downloads in separate obscurely named folders. The same docs can be saved so numerous times.

If the installer is relatively large in size, I've found that it's contained in a dmg versus a pkg, however.

So, I've read the documentation on Macports. As described:\n\nMacPorts is an easy to use system for compiling, installing, and managing open source software. MacPorts may be conceptually divided into two main parts: the infrastructure, known as MacPorts base, and the set of available ports. A MacPorts port is a set of specifications contained in a Portfile that defines an application, its characteristics, and any files or special instructions required to install it. This allows you to use a single command to tell MacPorts to automatically download, compile, and install applications and libraries. But using MacPorts to manage your open source software provides several other significant advantages. \n\nMost of this goes right over my head. I assume I'm not computer literate enough to understand it's purpose. Can anyone provide me with a simple explanation (to an average, rather than 'super' user) of the following questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*What is Macports used for? Can you give me a concrete example?\n\n*How does it relate to \"X11?\"\n\n\nIf the answer is simply, \"you need to understand these terms to understand what Macport is,\" then that's okay. Thank you.\n\nA: Macports is a tool for installing applications and command line tools on your Mac, with a huge library of “ports” (the Macports term for something that can be installed). You use it in Terminal.app like this:\n$ sudo port install nmap\n\nTo break this command down:\n\n*\n\n*The $ at the beginning generally means that you have to enter the rest of the line into Terminal. In the official documentation, it's a %%, but they both mean the same thing; don't paste or type that part, only the command after it. You will see the $ right before your cursor in Terminal.\n\n*sudo means that you'll be doing this as the “root user”, which can do (almost) anything with your system. Be very careful when you use it. It only works if you're an admin, and you have to enter your password.\n\n*port is the name of the Macports command itself.\n\n*install is an argument (also known as a command-line option) to the port command. You might see this referred to as a “subcommand”, which is because you're telling port what to do in general, rather than giving a specific thing like the name of what you want to install. Arguments are separated by spaces.\n\n*nmap is the name of the program to install. It's another command-line tool, and you use it for things like port scanning.\n\nSo, that command uses port to install the nmap tool. You might be installing things that have actual windows and a GUI more often, and that's where X11 comes in.\nX11\nThe X Window System is a system used to show windows, controls, and UI elements in general. The XQuartz project is an implementation of the X Window System on Mac OS X. It is one application that shows all the windows of apps that use X11. Usually, X11 is the easiest way to make something that can be used on both OS X and Linux without extra code, which is why you'll see a lot of Macports “ports” using it.\n\nIt's hard to keep the final “binaries” in sync with the source sometimes, which is why some things have to be compiled (turned from source to runnable file/app) on your computer.\nIt's really complicated under the hood, but the point of it is so people can do all this stuff automagically (with a little knowledge of Terminal and Unix) without having to worry about that. The “portfile” part of what you quoted is just the entry in the Macports database that explains everything that Macports needs to do in order to install something. Meaning it might be a script that you could run in Terminal, or some other program, but the point is to make it so you don't have to do any of the hard work.\nCurrently, Homebrew is a more popular alternative to Macports, but it doesn't have as many windowed (X11) applications. These types of things are usually called package managers.\n", "Q: MS Remote Desktop Issuessss While using Wi-Fi at work I'm able to use the remote desktop just fine to access the computers at work. When on any other network I'm unable to connect remotely.  By the way the computer that I am connecting to remotely uses windows XP that hasn't been updated since at least 2008...any answers. \n\nA: The answer is going to be more complex than you want, and someone else is going to recommend a service or web application that hides the complexity from you. The reason you are unable to reach your work computers from another network is because when on your internal network you have network access to the internal network. As long as you can reach the Internet from inside the internal network, you have a gateway to other networks. When outside your internal network, you'd need to know the external address of that gateway, and that gateway would need to be configured to port forward any ports your remote desktop client needs to serve your work desktop remotely to you. Your question is really simplistic and any answer that provides you a solution is going to need more information from you, such as do you have an IT department? Have you asked for remote access to your work terminal? That's kind of their job, so I'd make them do it.\n", "Q: Super and admin user in OS X Superuser account is disabled by default in OS X (Mavericks). But if you run sudo -l you will come to know that the admin user can execute all superuser commands. Then what is the point of disabling superuser? What are the actual differences between super user and admin user?\n\nA: \nBut if you run sudo -l you will come to know that the admin user can execute all superuser commands. Then what is the point of disabling superuser?\n\nAny user that can escalate their privilidges to root can execute all superuser commands, and any member of the admin group on OS X can escalate to root privilidges using sudo. Generally, without escalating to root privileges, a user cannot execute commands reserved to root, so you may be reading more into sudo -l than is there.\nThere is only one root account, one superuser. The point of disabling it is so that no one can gain access to the actual root account, they can only gain root privilidges by using sudo. Sudo offers some benefits: all attempts to authenticate with sudo are logged, and all commands run using sudo are logged; sudo can be restricted with user permissions using the /private/etc/sudoers file; sudo can be run using an admin users' password, so they don't need to know the root password; sudo will also eventually time out, and require authentication again. \nI found a very nice article here on the benefits of sudo and how it compares to using su or logging in as root. The article concerns Ubuntu, but the basic information remains the same for OS X and any BSD or UNIX flavor.\n", "Q: Is there a software to reset/flash your iphone to factory without itunes? i have two \"broken\" iphones. One of them, is a 3gs. I've changed is battery yesterday and it was ok for 30 min/1hour and then it just started rebooting. I searched online and i saw it was a common problem for the 3gs, nobody knows why but i would only need the battery to be charged and then it would be ok. I've tried to restore it itunes, sucessfully, but the phone wouldn't boot to the menu... Then itunes logo \"of death\".\nI tried restoring in DFU, normal, i've tried softwares like tiny umbrela to exit the reboot loop, but no success. In itunes it never ends recovering, and it allways pops out some error. I had probably 6 diferent errors until now. I've used a \"fixreboot\" file, that i think uses greenpoison code... I only know that maybe 90% of the lines it reports, are errors, and then it says \"no sucessfull firmware download after 60000ms, giving up\" and then it justs reboots to itunes logo again...\nThis phone was just upgraded, and hadn't have any jailbreak. \nThe other one is a iphone 4, and has the same problem... It's stuck on the Itunes logo but this one, i allways get Code 2 error on it when restoring.\nI guess the only way is to make it reinstall the firmware outside itunes. Is there any software to reinstall the firmwares other than itunes?\n\nA: There is a reset button that lets you reset several different properties to factory settings. If you open 'Settings' on the phone (if you are able) and goto 'General'. At bottom of 'General' is a reset button. Tapping that brings up options for reset.\n\nA: Try iFunBox, it can run on both PC/Mac.\nThere are actually a lot of 3rd party software able to update the iOS.\n\nA: You don't say what version of iTunes you have, the 3gs won't upgrade past iOS 6.1.6\nThis surprising page still hosts a 6.1.6 security update on the Apple website.\nThis even more surprising page has iTunes version 9.2.1 which was contemporary with your 3gs. It's possible that the newest iTunes don't have the needed package for your old phone.\nTry to download and install this Windows version (you don't specify if you have a Mac or Windows, these are Windows versions)\nAs a last resort, are you near an Apple store? Anyone gets their free 15 minutes of Genius bar help (a Specialist for iOS) (assuming they have not changed the policy since I worked there last year) and the Geniuses have pretty much every iOS package on the store network, so you don't have to download some scary thing from Softionic.\nYou could also try here. Or if you are really desperate here.\nThe last part of this answer is that your is more than likely just fried, time to upgrade to a iPhone 4s, the oldest one that supports the latest software :)\n", "Q: Deactivate automatic mark as read in Apple Mail 7.3 I just changed from Windows to OS X Mavericks with Apple Mail App 7.3. The first thing I'm wondering about is that I cannot disable the automation to mark an email as read by default when I just clicked on it. Is there any way to do so?\nI found TruePreview. But the tool does not support Mail 7.3 any more. Another solution would be to use a different mail client like Thunderbird. But there I miss the integration of the address book and the synchronisation with my iPhone and iPad.\n\nA: I've been using Mail Act-On. It's overkill (does a lot more than just keep messages unread) and kind of pricey at $30 (with free trial), but since it's a paid app, they keep it up to date. Even when TruePreview was being maintained, it'd sometimes be weeks or months before it was updated to work with the latest version of OS X.\n\nA: Use the standard keyboard shortcut, cmd+shift+u to toggle between “read” and “unread”. You can also go to System Preferences → Keyboard to customise your own keyboard shortcut.\n", "Q: How Do I Start Over With Backups Using Time Machine? I have a Mac Mini Server running the latest version of Mavericks and OS X Server.  I would like to do a full backup of my server.  I have no business need to keep the backups currently on the disk.  Can I just turn off Time Machine and delete Backups.backupdb through Finder or Terminal?  I also want to make sure that when I delete the backups that I can remove them from Trash.\nI have done searching on this but have only found information on how to delete backups of certain files or moving the backup disk to another volume.\n\nA: If you are backing up to an external disk, the fastest way is to\n\n\n*\n\n*disable Time Machine\n\n*erase the backup drive/partition with DiskUtil\n\n*re-enable Time Machine\n\n\nOTOH you won't loose anything if you keep the old backups for now. As every time slice within TM is a full backup you can still recover up to \"now\". \n", "Q: Mavericks OS X Server Software Updates: \"Duplicate\" entries? How do they differ? I'm running OS X Server on Mavericks with software updates service. In the list of updates there are several duplicate entries:\n\nFor instance there are two safari entries. Looking at the details, I can see that they have the product ids 031-02224 and 031-02225. Similar entries exist for iTunes updates etc. \nWhat are the differences between such duplicate entries? \nHow do I find out more details for those product ids? \n(Google comes up with a bunch of telephone numbers :-) )\n\nA: They're different versions of the software (Safari v6.1.4 in this case) that the client computer will choose between based on... well, something. The info about what the differences are (and which is needed for which clients) is all in computer-readable format, not really human-readable.\nYou can download the two packages, then search under /Library/Software Update/Data/html/content/downloads for them. And I do mean search -- the 031-02224 is in .../downloads/17/37/031-02224/8gxq9vhxcra3e5adif9fhvafxoefypqvlx. Spotlight will find the folders by the package ID, but only if you search in the relevant parent folder (if you do a general search, it omits them because they're considered \"system files\", not the sorts of things normal users would be interested in).\nOnce you've found the relevant folder read through the various files (especially the .pkm and .dist files), you'll find that 031-02224 is the version for Lion, and 031-02225 is the version for Mountain Lion.\nSo... it's possible to find out, but not easy (and far from user-friendly).\n", "Q: What is the specification of the extra screws needed to install a second drive to an upper-drive populated Mac Mini 2012? I ordered the wrong OWC Data Doubler kit. I didn't notice the note saying that some Mac Minis have an upper drive configuration and that it would require a variant of the kit with additional components. The additional items in the variant are the 5mm wrench and 2 set screws. I considered exchanging the item but the local shop that imported the item is charging me for the return. Does anybody know the specification of the additional screws that I need? There's a similar question I found here Can the 2011 Mac-Mini (not the Server Edition) Support an Additional Hardisk, SSD?. But it's unclear whether the ifixit kit mentioned here is for the lower drive config or upper drive config Mac Mini.\n\nA: According to iFixit's HD replacement guide for Mac Mini 2012, you need both a T6 Torx screwdriver and a T8 Torx screwdriver. The guide shows the corresponding screw specifications for each relevant step (IE two 6.6 mm T8 Torx screws), but iFixit only sells the screwdrivers, not the screws themselves AFAIK. They do, however, supply you with the information needed regarding all the relevant screws.\n", "Q: My project has disappeared from iMovie -- can you help me get it back?

Leave what's in there at first, because rcproject should match all iMovie files. If it says it couldn't find any files, click OK. If it still couldn't find any files (it might take a long time to look), then repeat the above with something else (like Klass 6B-9B).

If it lights up in all green, then the battery is fully charged.\nThe newer models actually don't have that feature, but they also get 30 days of standby time now, so they probably figured it wasn't necessary anymore.\n\nA: The button is for checking the current battery level without having to boot the the MacBook Pro. 8 LEDs mean a full charge; 4 LEDs a 1/2 charge, and so on down.\n", "Q: Double-click headphone button to change track function When listening to music on iTunes on my MacBook Air running OS 10.9, I am able to double-click the center headphone button to change track. \nI am wondering if it is possible to replicate this behavior to when I am listening to music in e. g.

If this is not the case:\nFAT-32 formatted flash drives should not spontaneously become write-protected; it's a sign that either the drive's controller (yes, flash drives have controllers) is corrupted requiring a reformat, or the drive is physically failing.

Now the program will not work and there never was an upgrade of the program. How can I undo Mavericks and go back to the way my Mac used to be? I want that Power PC program back worse than an upgraded Mac.  Find me an ABC Program that Surpasses this Dr. Seuss program and I might reconsider downgrading. Can you please help me?\n\nA: The last Mac OS which supported Power PC emulator (Rosetta) on x86 was Snow Leopard. You can back up your data using Time Machine, find distributive on your CD and install it.\nUPDATE\nAs people said, you should copy your data directly without using Time Machine.\n\nA: A simpler solution: you may be able to run Snow Leopard in a virtual machine. A quick Google shows that running Snow Leopard in Parallels under Mavericks should be possible. Here's the first link I found, for example.\n\nA: First, a sidenote, but of importance: You cannot restore a Time Machine backup from Mavericks to Snow Leopard. You need to back up your data in a different manner before rolling the OSX back.\nWith the risk of providing an answer which is both brief and externally linked, there is an excellent user tip from an ASC member for how to revert OS X back from Mavericks. This guide includes reverting back to Snow Leopard directly from Mavericks, which is what you're looking for. It's clear, detailed, and exactly the type of step-by-step guide I advise following. \n\nA: I had a similar issue - tried 10.8 on an 2010 MBP. In the end, I had to re-install the older OS, because Apple does not see that any user should ever want to go back from the latest version.\n\nIf you have an external USB volume, either put the new system on that and install 10.6 on the PB (note: You must manually select Rosetta, by default it will not be installed!), or install 10.6 on the USB. Use the Control Panel \"Start volume\" to select which to boot from.\n\n10.6.8 has become Apple's Windows XP. There are lots of good reasons not to upgrade.\n", "Q: Time Machine restores and network settings Not sure if this has already been asked (I didn't find the question in my search) but I am really curious to know if a Time Machine restore restores my network settings. I have a broadband Internet connection configured on my system and don't have the settings variables written down elsewhere. And I am planning to perform a clean upgrade of my OS when 10.10 is available.\nAlso, does Time Machine restore any custom application-level keyboard shortcuts I might have currently active on my system? If yes, does a TM backup automatically restore these things (Internet settings and custom shortcuts)?\n\nA: After performing your clean install, you can launch the migration assistant and choose Time Machine as your source. This will allow you to select what to restore including Applications, Documents and Home Folder, System and Network settings, and all of your application settings.

Without the need to turn on my PC if I want to print?\nAny apps for this?\nNote:printer isnt airprint capable\nThanks\n\nA: Printer Pro\nYou can use Printer Pro. This app will scan your network for all printers using the same services as OS X, to find all printers available rather than just AirPrint printers.\n\nCompatible with any Printer (Wi-Fi and USB)\n  Printer Pro automatically finds a printer in your wi-fi network.\n\nYou can download Printer Pro Lite for free to test if your printer is found by the app before purchase.\n", "Q: Will my files be deleted if I update OS X? I have version 10.6.8 now but it says that its too old when I try to buy some apps..\n\nA: When updating OS X it only updates the system files, so all the files under /Users/ (which includes your home directory) are safe.\nHowever, keeping a regular Time Machine backup is recommended, so that if something goes wrong you can restore your files and settings as needed.\nYou can go a step further and make a manual copy of your /Users and /Applications folders to a separate disk before installing major OS updates, so you can retrieve them without having to go through the Time Machine interface (for example, on a non-Mac computer, in case you ever need to.)\n", "Q: Bluetooth lagging when Magic Mouse and a bluetooth speaker connected I'm having problems with my Bluetooth on my MacBook Pro Retina early 2013 OS X 10.9.3\nIt is constantly losing connection for a few seconds with my Magic Mouse and my Bluetooth speaker (Bose Soundlink Mini) occasionally even resetting the connection so I have to reconnect both.\nI started having this problem just recently but it's not the speaker's fault (I've tried others) or the mouse's fault—I've tried disconnecting it.\nI have also tried restarting the computer, freeing some memory and so on...\nHow I can I fix this?\n\nA: I don't know that there's anything you can do about this—speakers just use up a lot of Bluetooth's available bandwidth. While I've never had trouble with JUST a speaker and mouse, I've found that if I connect a Bluetooth mouse, keyboard, and speaker at once, the speaker becomes horribly stuttery until either the mouse or keyboard is disconnected.\nYou say you've already tried different speakers; I might try different mice as well. You could try a USB Bluetooth adapter, but there's no guarantee that it will be any better. Also, if you have any additional Bluetooth devices you didn't tell us about, definitely disconnect those as well.\n(At one point, I set up Eventscripts to automatically disconnect my keyboard whenever a Bluetooth speaker was connected. It worked, but was somewhat fragile, and I don't recommend it.)\nYou could also try lowering macOS's Bluetooth audio quality in the terminal so it uses less bandwidth. I have never been able to get acceptable results this way, but it could be worth a try. https://lifehacker.com/fix-your-bluetooth-audio-in-yosemite-with-this-terminal-1670380974\nYou're not going to like this solution, but I would recommend replacing either the mouse or speaker with a non-Bluetooth alternative, such as a wireless mouse with a USB dongle or a wifi speaker that works over airplay.\nSorry this isn't the answer you wanted.\n\nA: Check the battery level in your keyboard or mouse. I've found this happens consistently when the peripheral battery is running low and the device seems to start spamming the Bluetooth connection with \"help I'm running out of juice\" requests. Swapping out your batteries for full ones will reliably fix the issue.\n\nA: I had a related problem which was driving me nuts, & it took forever to track down. Seems wifi was stopping my Apple Magic Mouse from working - turns out the macBook was sharing my connection on channel 11, & as soon as I stopped wifi sharing the mouse worked great. I've got it sharing on channel 48 (5GHz) now, & so far everything works perfectly.\nAs bluetooth & wifi can share the same frequency band, it makes sense to use the 5GHz band for wifi, gives your bluetooth stuff more space.\n\nA: It happened to my JBL Flip 5, so I performed a full reset of JBL and reconnected it to my MacBook again - voila - no lag and no Bluetooth interference.\nIt seems like it comes back (much less) after reconnect or switch back from another bluetooth device. I performed a full reset again – no lag again.\n\nA: I have tried several ways but nothing worked, except one: re-connecting the mouse and the speaker.\nHere is what did the job for me.\n\n*\n\n*Remove the Bluetooth connections of the devices (go to the Bluetooth symbol on the top right corner -> Bluetooth preference, click on \"x\" to remove)\n\n\n*Open Terminal, remove the connections\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\nsudo rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\n\n\n\n*Reconnect the devices (via Bluetooth symbol, top right corner)\n\nA: If I just turn off my magic mouse, and turn it back on, that seems to fix the issue for the time being\n", "Q: All apps unresponsive in iMac All Apps on my iMac are completely unresponsive.

I want a stable IDE for coding in C/C++ on Mac OS X Mavericks.\nCurrently I am using Code::Blocks but it sometimes closes reporting some strange list of errors. Also the Code::Blocks \"logs(F2)\" does some impairment to the editor area by leaving partial prints. I'm looking for an alternative now; can you suggest one?\n\nA: The CLion cross-platform IDE by JetBrains for C and C++ was recently announced. It is only available as an “early access program” build right now, but when it’s stable, I’m sure it will be good. (Warning: it will cost money.) You might choose CLion over Eclipse for the same reasons you might choose JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDEA over Eclipse when programming Java.\n\nA: My opinion is that IDEs do nothing good and a lot of things poorly and that you should look to build your dev environment out of a suite of tools that focus on doing small things well. But, if you're dead set on an IDE, the standard for open source, free IDEs is Eclipse.\nFor C and C++ development, Eclipse has the CDT framework which gives you all of its heavyweight IDE-type things for your C and C++ code: introspection, code completion, refactoring tools, syntax highlighting, debugger integration and so on.\nIt's been around a long time now and is both stable and robust.\n\nThe CDT Project provides a fully functional C and C++ Integrated Development Environment based on the Eclipse platform. Features include: support for project creation and managed build for various toolchains, standard make build, source navigation, various source knowledge tools, such as type hierarchy, call graph, include browser, macro definition browser, code editor with syntax highlighting, folding and hyperlink navigation, source code refactoring and code generation, visual debugging tools, including memory, registers, and disassembly viewers.\n\n\n\nA: Pretty surprised no one said NetBeans. It has a C/C++ version like Eclipse. From what I've done with it, it works fine. Also it is pretty lightweight.\n\nA: The Xamarin IDE also works with C/C++, and has a free version.\nOf course, it's designed to be used with their C# cross-platform development system - but claims to work with C/C++ as well.\n\nA: MacVim + YouCompleteMe\n\n\n*\n\n*CMake for project mgmt\n\n*ninja for building (cmake -G Ninja)\n\n*and XCode for debugging/profiling/static analysis (cmake -G Xcode)\nxcode debugger uses LLVM's debugger 'lldb', shows clangs static analysis output in a nice way (btw, you can use scan-build/scan-view as an alternative)\nand xcode's profiling tools are usable and nicely wrapped in gui's \n", "Q: Mavericks - Tell application \"Preview\" open PDF - strange permission issue I have recently moved a large research collection of PDF files, from a Snow Leopard 10.6.8 TimeMachine disk, to my new rMBP (to the internal flash storage). I did this manually, not through the TimeMachine interface. The rMBP runs Mavericks 10.9.3.\nWhen I double click the PDFs, they open without a problem in Preview.\nBut, when I write a small AppleScript to open one, for example:\ntell application \"Preview\"\n    activate\n    open \"/Users/me/Desktop/test.pdf\"\nend tell\n\nI get the following error on executing the AppleScript:\n\nThe file “test.pdf” couldn’t be opened because you don’t have\n  permission to view it. To view or change permissions, select the item\n  in the Finder and choose File > Get Info.\n\nI look in Get Info for test.pdf. In the \"Sharing and Permissions\" tab, it does not matter what I set permissions to, even if all users can Read & Write the file, I still get the error.\nConversely, if I download a PDF from the internet, straight to the desktop, and execute the applescript to open it, it opens in Preview without a problem.\n(p.s. I need to open PDF by AppleScript, as part of a larger system I have, I am not just doing it for fun!)\n\nA: for me do shell script.. failed, but this one below worked.\nset filepath to POSIX path of \"Users:student:Desktop:Yourfile.pdf\"\ntry\n    set command to \"open \" & quoted form of filepath\n    do shell script command\nend try\nNote: Instead of \":\" for file path I used \"/\", a modification one can try.\nSource of Code: MacRumors\n\nA: This problem is caused by Apple's sandboxing of Preview (and other apps). Preview does not receive an entitlement to access the PDF if you just pass it a string to open.  From Apple's release notes:\n\nCompatibility Notes\nWhen sending commands to a sandboxed application, such as TextEdit in OS X Mountain Lion, parameters that refer to files must be of an explicit file-like type and not a bare string, or the target application will not be able to access the file. For example, file \"Macintosh HD:Users:me:sample.txt\", POSIX file \"/Users/me/sample.txt\", or the result of choose file would all be acceptable, but the string \"/Users/me/sample.txt\" would not.\n\nWhy does this work for the file in your Downloads folder? When you open a file manually, the application retains the entitlement to open it (in Recents, for instance). Therefore, if you try any file you've opened already, odds are it will work, but it won't work on new files.\nTo fix, change your code to read:\ntell application \"Preview\"\n    activate\n    open POSIX file \"/Users/me/Desktop/test.pdf\"\nend tell\n\n\nA: The comment provided by Edouard fixed this problem. Bizarrely, using the command line to launch Preview bypasses the permissions issue.\nHere is the modified AppleScript, made robust to PDFs with spaces in their names:\n    do shell script \"open -a Preview \" & quoted form of \"/Users/me/Desktop/this has spaces and 'punctuation'.pdf\"\n\n\nA: I am now having a similar problem with Preview. I downloaded some files from Apple. I can use Quicklook in the Finder to see their content but not open with Preview despite being able to set the permissions in Get Info to Everyone Read+Write.\nI checked and other files that were OK in the same folder are now experiencing this problem.

It might be that simple - just quit the app.\nI have been experiencing weird Finder slowdowns on my system with the spinner going for many seconds on opening a directory. I don't know if the two issues are related. I also wondered if this was somehow related to the relaunch setting re-opening windows.\n\nA: Restarting preview also solved the problem of not being able to open files even from the finder due to this permissions problem, as Andy Dent suggested.\n", "Q: Use one AppleScript to toggle on and off (1 or 0) I'm wondering if there's a simple way to use one AppleScript program to turn something on and off.

I have browsed some of the questions here, but I cannot seem to figure out how to, very simply, delete a directory from my PATH. (I should also add that I am very to to Mac, making the transition from Windows). \nSo: I have gathered that I can make a .bashrc, .bash_profile, etc etc, to ADD files to my PATH. I think I get that. \nHowever what I cannot seem to find a direct answer to, is: How do I simply delete a specific existing directory, from my PATH? This is all I would honestly like to do. \nThank you.\nEDIT: Why I want to remove a directory from PATH:\nLong story short, homebrew put a directory into my PATH, that it no longer needs. It says I can remove it from PATH, and so this is why I would like to remove it. Here is a screen shot:\n\n\nA: It depends where the PATH is being set. If you use bash, the path could be set in any of the following:\n/etc/profile\n/etc/bashrc\n~/.bash_profile\n~/.bash_login\n~/.profile\n~/.bashrc\n\nThis list is in the order that the files are read (by bash). Later files override earlier files.\nCheck the above in reverse order for export PATH which will write your PATH variable.\nYou should be able to find where it's set by launching your shell with -x.\nAlso check /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d for paths that are set before your shell is started.\nIf all else fails, you can set the PATH yourself to override its current contents. Run echo $PATH, then paste your PATH after export PATH in your ~/.bashrc and make your desired modifications. As ~/.bashrc is the last one read, it will override any earlier modifications to your PATH.\nIf you use zsh, it's probably in ~/.zshrc or a sourced file.\n", "Q: I can't get my iPod touch to show up in iTunes what am I doing wrong?

So, after doing a bit of poking around I discovered my iTunes hadn't been updated in quite sometime!\n\nI accessed the administrator account on my computer, clicked on the \"Start\" button (the button in the lower left corner in XP and 7), there I found an Apple software update button, clicked on that and it brought iTunes up to date.

You can debug your start up files by running:\nbash -x -l\n\nand watching the output -- you'll see all the commands that are being run on startup and hopefully spot the line where Setting is trying to be used as a command. If you want to post your startup files more help might be possible.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"startup files\"? \n\nWhen your bash shell starts, it reads and executes a bunch of standard startup files to setup your environment. It usually starts with /etc/profile and then everything in the /etc/profile.d/*.sh directory. Then it moves on to the user-level ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc files.\nBased on the output you posted your problem is here:\n++ '[' -z '' ']'\n++ PROMPT_COMMAND='update_terminal_cwd; '\n+ Setting PATH for Python 2.7\nbash: Setting: command not found\n\nYou have the literal line:\nSetting PATH for Python 2.7\n\nin one of the startup files. It should either be prefixed with echo or commented out with a # character.\nTry and find the file by running these commands in a Terminal:\ngrep -H Setting /etc/bashrc /etc/profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.bashrc\n\nFrom the depth marker, the single + in that output, it's in a top-level file, not something being sourced from one of them.\nIf that grep command matches it'll print the file name.

Is it possible that once completely dry it will work as usual?\n\nA: In situation as you described, HDD could survive with high probability, but as MBP retina uses SSD instead there is a small, but chance to kill it. First steps to repair it is to disconnect the battery and disconnect the SSD. This is guarantee to prevent:\n1) future information losses\n2) future damage of logic board.  \nWhat damages can you expect - generally, in these cases this is 50/50 game. Cleaning requires disassembly of the MacBook and wiping board with cleaning agent e.g. ethyl alcohol (96% concentrated). It is non-conductor, so then when macbook will be reassembled, it probably will work.\nMy friend had similar problem: water and MBP retina 13. And now his MBPr works OK, but only with power cord plugged in. I do not recommend connect it to power cord until it properly dried and cleaned (with alcohol).\n", "Q: How can I remap Caps lock to both Escape and Control? I generally run Linux. I use Vim a lot, so the Escape key is extremely important. I also use other keyboard shortcuts a lot, so Control is \"key\" as well.

This puts the best of both worlds within quick reach of my pinky finger. Is there any way I can do this on a Mac?\n\nA: To do it with Karabiner Elements, which supports macOS 10.12 and later, open ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json, and add the following rule to the rules array.\n{\n  manipulators: [\n    {\n      description:\n        \"Change caps_lock to control when used as modifier, escape when used alone\",\n      from: {\n        key_code: \"caps_lock\",\n        modifiers: {\n          optional: [\"any\"]\n        }\n      },\n      to: [\n        {\n          key_code: \"left_control\"\n        }\n      ],\n      to_if_alone: [\n        {\n          key_code: \"escape\",\n          modifiers: {\n            optional: [\"any\"]\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      type: \"basic\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nYou can also try to use ControlEscape.spoon with Hammerspoon.\n\nA: Yes, using Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4Macbook). \nFirst, go into the Keyboard preference pane, click \"Modifier Keys…\", and change Caps Lock to Control. Then, go into Karabiner and search for this option:\n\nControl_L to Control_L\n         (+ when you type Control_L only, send Escape)\n\nCheck that, and you're done. With Karabiner you can do lots more interesting things, like mapping your (now kind of useless) Escape key to a Hyper key with even more keybindings. \n\nA: Karabiner is currently incompatible with MacOS Sierra. Another, Sierra-friendly solution, is with Keyboard Maestro (it is not free). Change the behavior of the Caps-Lock key to Control through System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys as others have suggested. \nThen within Keyboard Maestro, setup a macro as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Triggered by USB Device Key Trigger\n\n*Press the Caps-Lock key on your keyboard\n\n*is tapped once\n\n*with these modifiers: ^\n\n*(you will need to repeat the previous trigger for each USB keyboard you use)\n\n*Then add an action Text -> Type a keystroke\n\n*Press Esc\n\n", "Q: How to activate external display when Macbook display is dead I have a Macbook which I bought in the fall of 2009.  I recently upgraded it to OS X Mavericks via the free download.  The display has been flaky for a few months; the mouse worked and you could click buttons and close windows and so forth, but the image would sometimes flicker or slide back and forth.  So this made me think that the problem is with the display and not the CPU or anything like that.  Well now the display is totally dead, it gives me nothing but vertical gray bars.  \nI have an external display connected via HDMI adapter, but the computer is not sending a signal to it.  Is there someway I can force the computer to send the display image to the external monitor, like say by holding down a particular key while booting?\nThank you to anyone who can advise me.  I can't afford to buy another computer right now.\n\nA: Pressing Command + F1 should enable mirroring of the internal display to the external monitor.\nOnce that is enabled you can go to System Preferences to tinker with more advanced stuff like resolution and refresh rate.\n", "Q: Apple support, mac with unencrypted drive Because of an incident happened a few days ago, I'll have to bring my MacBook Pro to an Apple Store to get it repaired.\nProblem:\nEven though automatic logins are disabled, and to access the computer it is necessary to type username password, the hard drive is not encrypted with file vault. The computer does not switch on, so I can't do anything to enable it now.\nOf course, this means that connecting the hard drive to another computer will make its contents fully accessible. This is my fault for not enabling file vault, I know.\n\nIn any case, I am mentally assessing what kind of sensible data is present on the drive.\nI do not store logins and passwords in plain text files (I keep them encrypted with a specific application), but my default browser has cookies to automatically login into a number of services.\nThe Apple Mail app, also, has automatic access to my email accounts, although I believe that those login details are stored in OS X Keychain, which should be protected by the user's password.\nQuestion\nDoes anyone know to what extent my data is exposed? What I should mostly worry about? What would be available to an attacker?\nAlso, does anyone have information about the policies of Apple support with the data on mac computers?\n\nA: Your data is fully exposed, unless you have specifically encrypted files using a passphrase not stored on your hard drive.\nPasswords and Secure Notes stored in the Keychain are encrypted on disk. If you have configured your Mac to require a password on boot, this password is usually also used as your Keychain Password. If this password is sufficiently hard to guess, your Keychain data should be safe.\nAs you note, your browser's session cookies (those that are are still valid) could potentially be exploited.\nYou can read Apples official document on keeping your data secure during hardware repair here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3294\nRegarding Apple's policy - you can read their Service Terms here:\nhttp://images.apple.com/legal/sales-support/terms/repair/generalservice/Service_Terms_English.pdf\nApple writes that they are not responsible for loss, recovery, or compromise of your data.\nThat being said, I'm pretty sure that Apple's guidelines for their service technicians make it clear that they are not allowed to, for example, copy of all your images on to a USB pendrive and bring that home with them after work. Depending on your location that would most probably also be illegal. That doesn't mean it can't happen though.\n", "Q: Configured Airport as Bridge and use OS X Server for DHCP and DNS, no Internet I want to use my Mac Mini as an OS X Server with the following services: \n\n\n*\n\n*DNS\n\n*DHCP  \n\n*Open Directory\n\n*Profile Manager\n\n\nI configured my Airport Extreme under the \"Internet\" tab to use my static IP supplied from my ISP. I'm using the IP of my Mac Mini as the primary DNS server and no secondary DNS server. Under \"Network\", I have router mode set to Off (Bridge Mode). \nWhen I open Safari on the Mac Mini server, I'm not getting any Internet connection at all. I checked in the DNS settings of the server and made sure I had forwarding servers pointing to my ISP DNS and Google DNS (as backup). Under Sys Prefs, I have a static IP assigned and pointing DNS to itself.\nHow can I have my Mac Mini supply DNS, DHCP, and RADIUS wireless support and still get Internet?\n\nA: You're trying to accomplish more in one step than you can handle. Break down your problem into subproblems, and solve each one.\nThe first you want to get working is to have an internet connection on your Mac Mini when the Airport is set in bridge mode. Do this without setting up DNS-servers and changing DNS settings to use your Mac Mini as the DNS server.\nWhen you have working, you can add on the DNS.\nBasically at this point you want to ensure:\na) That the Mac Mini's network port is setup with the correct IP, subnet mask and default gateway. This is the static IP and network settings, you have been supplied by your ISP.\nb) That your Mac Mini can \"ping\" addresses on the internet. Open Network Utility and try to an address on the Internet. Try first with an IP (such as 23.78.125.15) and then with a DNS-name (such as www.apple.com).\nRemember that in this (simple) scenario, you can only use an IP-address once. I.e. if you assign a static IP to the AirPort Extreme, you cannot assign the same static IP to your Mac Mini.\nIf you have got only one static IP, you cannot use that IP on both the Airport Extreme and on your Mac Mini.\n", "Q: Opening apps in same desktop I have 10.8.5.  I have a laptop with a larger monitor on an A/B switch.  I want to open AutoCAD on desktop 1 on on the main monitor.  I want to open Safari on desktop 1 on the laptop screen so I can take a class on Safari, and immediately do the work in AutoCAD.  I cannot get them to be on the same desktop.  How do I do that?\n\nA: On 10.8.5\n\nAfter you connect the displays to your computer, you can choose\n  whether to use the displays as an extended desktop or for video\n  mirroring. If you choose video mirroring, the displays each show the\n  same image. If you choose an extended desktop, the displays form one\n  large continuous desktop.\nIf you are playing a DVD on a television connected to your computer,\n  click the Arrangement button in Displays preferences and move the menu\n  bar to the television. If you don’t see an Arrangement button, your\n  computer is only capable of mirroring (showing the same image on all\n  screens). For more information, see the manual that came with your\n  computer.\n\nOn 10.9.3 (Mavericks)\n\nWith an external display connected to your Mac, you can work the way\n  you want. Each display has its own menu bar, and apps can run in full\n  screen mode on each display.

In the windowing user interface, why does quitting an application open the minimised window of a running application?\nThis happens in Mavericks, and possibly earlier versions of the OS.\n\nA: OSX is setup to have a window take focus, this usually requires a Window to show, this is being in the foreground. The application that this window belongs to  is the process that receives and interprets keystrokes (strictly key events) (after the system global ones are dealt with)\nThus when you quit an application the OS has to choose an Application to put in the foreground.\nI can't find the overall description in one document so this is based on development experience. If someone could find the correct overview this would help.\n\nA: I guess you might be talking about other systems way of 'quitting' an application, that is by pressing 'x' button on the top left. \nIn Mac OS X by doing that you're not quitting the application, but just closing the  window which you pressed 'x' button of; the application usually still runs in the background (if you haven't changed that you should see light indicator under the icon in the dock for any running application (running means it's loaded into memory and does not necessary needs to have any open windows).\nYou might think of it as for example running Chrome in the background on Windows (only icon in sys tray), without actually having any browser windows open.\nTo properly quit an application you can do 3 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*instead of hitting 'x' button, press Ctrl+q\n\n*right click on the application icon in Dock -> Quit\n\n*use top bar menu for application, f.ex.: Chrome -> Quit Google Chrome\n\n\nNote: some applications may react differently for 'x' button. From the top of my head: calculator will quit completely; pressing 'x' on running Parallels VM window will suspend it.\n(edit) there is one more way of closing an application, that is to press Cmd+Option(Alt)+Esc - that will bring 'Force quit application' window. But it is generally used if some application is misbehaving, so is not a \"proper\" way of quitting an app.\n(edit2) ofc you can also kill the application process in the console, but that is also not default way of doing it :)\n", "Q: OS X 10.9.3 finder issues Upgraded the OS on my Desktop PC.

The MIP looks great, however I cannot see the option to export to Quicktime VR anywhere. I have seen the option in the user guides as a button in the toolbar (it looks somewhat 5 years old), though I can't imagine they'd take away such a handy feature.\nAnyone else manage to find it?\n\nA: Found it!

Of course, it is out of warranty, so there will be a charge.\nBut, are there any conditions in order for them to perform a repair? Since I bought the laptop I have replaced its memory from the standard 4GB to 8GB. If it were still under warranty, is this something they would refuse to repair for (void)?\nDo they have any conditions in order for them to repair, even when out of warranty?\n\nA: You should have no problems since you are paying for the repair anyway. Plus, upgrading the RAM on a MacbookPro does not void your warranty.\n\nA: Option 1\nYou should Google for a replacement and do it yourself. \nApple will charge you way more than repairing it yourself. You don't have warranty, so why don't just do it yourself? If you fail, you can still go back to them because you're paying.\nOption 2\nYou could also consider buying an USB superdrive instead. It will be much cheaper, and you could eventually replace the SuperDrive with an Optibay so you can add a second HDD (or SSD)\n", "Q: Looking for Mac Typing software that supports Spanish keyboard layouts - Recommendations?

CMD-L brings focus to the Address Bar.  Is there are shortcut key for toggling back to the document of the current tab?  How else might I achieve this other than a keyboard shortcut built in to Safari?\nContext:\nSafari 7\nOSX Mavericks\n\nA: You can ⇥ back, or alternatively ⇧⇥ which is usually faster.\nIt takes me two presses of ⇧⇥ to get back from the address bar to the page: one to move to the Add to Reading List button and one to get back to the page.

I just got a used Macbook Air (The original 2008 model) for writing purposes only. It came with Mac OS X 10.6.8 installed + Office for Mac 2008. However it's very slow and I have tried tools (like TinkerTool and Onyx) to speed it up and turn off the 'eye candy' but it still goes sluggish after around 20-25 minutes of usage.

First, I want the music off it, because they're my favorite artist.  Also randomly I got a bunch of other songs my mom downloaded for me, and I really want those too.\nHere's my issue.  Most of the songs were either on the phone before I got, or I ripped some CDs.  Now I've done this before, but with when I went to sync my music.  It said 0 songs.  I have over two hundred songs.

I am a linux guy and I am very new to Mac OS X. I tried but I just prefer to have my familiar debian running on this laptop. On a PC I would do this easily, but Mac is a different story.\nCould anyone tell me if it's possible to run Kali Linux (Debian 6) on the original Macbook Air (proper installation, not on a virtual machine on Mac OS X) and if yes, how?\n\nA: GUI\nYou can use the native OS X Disk Utility.app to split, resize, create & remove partitions as desired.\nCLI\nIf you prefer to work with a UNIX-style bash shell, there are tools available via OS X's native Terminal.app command-line interface.\n\nOne of these would be a good start:\nroot@host:~# diskutil\nroot@host:~# diskutil list\nroot@host:~# diskutil listFileystems\nroot@host:~# diskutil activity\n\nOnce you have a bit of info, you might want a few of these:\nroot@host:~# diskutil splitPartition\nroot@host:~# diskutil resizeVolume\nroot@host:~# diskutil eraseDisk\nroot@host:~# diskutil eraseVolume  \n\nBoot from your installation media by holding the alt/⌥ option key during startup.\n\nA: I recently looked into this myself. Note, I had an easier time installing Ubuntu over Debian, but it may have been due to a corrupt Debian image. Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*First step is to install the boot manager rEFInd (http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/). If you're like me and don't like the default GUI it can easily be themed.\n\n*Make some free space on the hard drive. As stated by tjt263 you can either use diskutil in the terminal or the Disk Utility app.\n\n*Once you have the necessary free space reboot with the install media inserted, and boot to it from rEFInd.\n\n*(the easy part) Now just install Linux as you would on a PC. Create a partition on the free space you made earlier, and sit back. One note: I had trouble here as neither Debian nor Ubuntu could work the wireless card without the necessary drivers, so have an ethernet cord at the ready.\n\n*Once your install's complete go ahead and boot to it from rEFInd. If you installed GRUB you may find it overwrote rEFInd as the default boot manager. If this is the case (and you ever care to boot to OS X) you can do so by holding ALT on boot (before the chime) and the apple boot manager will be loaded, where you can boot to OS X and reinstall rEFInd.\n\n*Now have fun getting the necessary drivers up and running and you should be good to go. My main issue with Debian was it not booting to the desktop manager. Maybe you'll have more luck than I did. Ubuntu did not have this issue.\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\nA: You can use VirtualBox and install Kali Linux on it. I am using Kali Linux 2 on my MacBook Pro. I have assigned it 4GB RAM and it runs smoothly.\n", "Q: Is it possible to download iOS 8 beta without Developer Account? My device is iPhone 5 (American version). Is it possible to get iOS 8 beta without buying access to Developer Account?\n\nA: No.\nYou need to be a registered developer agreeing to the license agreements AND your device needs to be registered as a development device.\nAs always, there are ways around this, but that is illegal. Torrent sites sometimes offer the software and in the comments developers offer to register your device as a development device. But these developers are at risk to lose their own development access.\nFurthermore the first betas tend to be buggy. Unless you have an obsessive need for the latest stuff or are a developer you don't actually want it on your phone. \n\nA: yes register your udid and download it or wait a couple days or weeks perhaps and wait for the un-registered version to come out \n", "Q: iPhone 5 slowly fails to connect to wifi My iPhone 5 running 7.1.1 has stopped connecting to wifi networks. \nIn the beginning, everything was fine. It seemed like maybe the network in my house was stretched a little thin, and I had trouble connecting at one end of the house. So did all of our other devices, so I thought nothing of it. \nThen I moved to a house where I don't have access to the wifi controls. My phone began to drop the connection periodically, but I could usually get back in after a few tries. I blamed it on my stepdad's weird network settings that I couldn't access. Until I stopped being able to get in at all. No matter what, I got the \"Unable to join the network \"[our network]\"\" dialog and \"Failed to join [\"ournetwork\"]\".\nI was still blaming it on my stepdad (because that's what stepdads are for) when I realized I couldn't connect to any of the public wifi networks in places I visit periodically (and have successfully connected to before).\nI have restarted my iPhone and reset its network settings. This morning I did a full backup and restore, having read around the internet that that fixed the problem for many. During the iOS setup process, I was asked to enter a password for a nearby wifi network. Nada. Couldn't get in. \nIt's like my iPhone 5 just slowly forgot how to wifi. How do I remind it?\n\nUpdate!\n\nI took my phone to the Genius Bar, where an Apple employee ran all the diagnostics and looked into a bunch of histories. He found that TCCService had been crashing periodically, and did a Reset All Settings (as opposed to Reset Network Settings, which I'd already done).\nIt seems to have helped a little bit, but it remains to be seen whether this has fixed the problem completely. \n\nLong-awaited update\n\nProfiles were to blame.\nI have a couple of different custom profiles on my phone because I work with a few beta apps. Removing obsolete profiles fixed this problem.\n\nA: If re-setting your network connections didn't help, it could be a hardware problem.\nDepending on when it was made, it could be that your WiFi chip inside the phone has pulled  (or, rather, is in the process of pulling) off of the circuit board. Late 4S models also had this problem, and here's how it manifests (progressively):\n\n\n*\n\n*Very slow speeds / drops connection to the network intermittently\n\n*Stops seeing most (or all) networks, but the WiFi button still works, it's not grayed out\n\n*Can't turn WiFi on at all, the button is grayed out in the settings menu - but the WiFi button in the control center might appear to work. \n\n\nIf your phone is under warranty, then take it to an Apple store and have them replace it. Believe it or not, the repair is quite easy, so if it's out of warranty and you know of a place that fixes phones, they've probably got some spare chips and won't charge too much. Apparently, it's a manufacturing defect, so a repaired phone fixed by someone that knows their stuff could last quite some time. \nThis has only been a problem with certain 4S and 5 models, you'll see a bunch of people reporting it if you search for something like \"iPhone in freezer\" - because (believe it or not), putting your phone in a Ziplock and then freezing it for a few minutes has been known to fix the problem for a short time (though I don't recommend doing this).\nAFAIK, this isn't an issue with 5C, 5S or recently (as in the last year) manufactured iPhone 5 units. Could be a good opportunity to upgrade, even if you manage to get it fixed. \n", "Q: find my iPhone is 'offline' I lost my iPhone after I checked it in find my phone it shows that the device is offline. \nI want to know it means that the phone is 100% switched off or find my iPhone was not kept on in my iPhone [because I don't remeber correctly it was on or not] \nDoes find my iPhone works on International Mobile Equipment identity number or Subscriber Identity Module? \n\nA: You can not find out if the phone is 100% turned off.  The issue is that the phone may not have any network connectivity which would cause it to show as off line in find my phone.\nThe phone needs to communicate with Apple's servers and let them know that it is on and the GPS provides the location information.  If a person were to keep the phone on, but turn on Airplane mode, then the phone will show as offline in find my phone.\nSorry about you losing your phone...hope this answers your question.\n\nA: In regards to the question about whether the phone is on or not, it is either on (but has no internet connection), or is completely dead/switched off.\nFind My iPhone is certainly on because if you didn't switch it on, or if it was turned off after setup of the device, it would not appear at all in the Find My iPhone app or on iCloud.\nFind My iPhone does not run on SIM cards nor does it run on IMEIs, it solely works based on Apple iCloud Servers.\n", "Q: Can I code using Swift on Mavericks?

I would keep my stable version of Xcode installed as the beta may be a little buggy, but it will get you started till a stable version gets release which will probably this fall.\n\nA: To code using Swift you'll need Xcode 6. \nXcode 6 beta is compatible with Mavericks 10.9.3 and upwards so yes it is possible to write Swift code in Mavericks!\nNB: As of July 11, Xcode 6 beta is available freely on Apple's website.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where can I download Xcode (n) Beta?\n\nA: Currently the only way to use Xcode for Swift programming is through the Beta version of Xcode 6.

(to be precise, I'm talking about Version 6.0.1 (6A317)).\nI was surprised to see that (in contrast to XCode 6 beta) it does support Swift only for iOS!\n(Look at this screenshot, this is what I see when trying to create a Swift playground; also, Swift can be choosed as a language for iOS project, but not for OS X project)  \n", "Q: Custom keyboard shortcuts/mapping I have been fiddling around with the keyboard shortcuts in sys preferences, and have to say the options seem limitless, and fantastic. I'm a huge keyboard user and will do everything I can without using a pointing device.\nI have however a huge preference for using the bottom-left-most button for all modifier actions (instead of the default  Cmd ⌘  ). This is not even related to \"being used to how Windows works\", I simply find it very uncomfortable to use  Cmd ⌘   - the  Fn  button on my laptop is actually what I've been using.\nSo - I could not find any other way than to use the custom shortcuts, and had to map each action one by one. I set most of them to \"All Applications\" (Copy, Paste, Cut, Save, Select All, Undo, Redo, Refresh, Close Tab, etc.)\nMy issue is this : because we have to use the exact Menu Name, it turns out that setting  Ctrl ⌃   W   to \"Close Tab\" in Google Chrome, will not \"Close tab\" in Filezilla.\nIt also turns out that I cannot re-use  Ctrl ⌃   W  for more than one action. In other words, I can't use custom shortcuts if the action has a different name in different software.\nIs there a way around this?\nMuch appreciated,\n\nA: You can actually just remap the Modifier keys, if that would help - it would save you having to try modifying all the standard shortcuts.\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Keyboard > Modifier Keys…\nBelow is an example showing  Cmd ⌘  &  Ctrl ⌃  swapped \n\n", "Q: How can I tell which SSL ciphersuite Safari is using? Qualsys tells me that current versions of Safari on OS X don't support AES-GCM for the SSL/TLS cipher algorithm.  I'd like to verify this by observing which cipher suite is selected when visiting my website.  However, the only technical information Safari seems to provide is related to the certificate, not the connection itself.\nI'm also interested in being able to find this information because I like to check the key exchange algorithm on sites for forward secrecy.  I don't generally use Safari for day-to-day operations, but, y'know, sometimes it's necessary.\nIs there a way to determine the ciphersuite being used for a particular connection in Safari?\n\nA: The information you are looking for is easily available in Chrome (v35).  Just click on the lock icon in the browser location bar and the cipher suite details are there.\nBut you asked about Safari. Clicking on the lock icon in Safari 7.0.4 only gives a fraction of what you get in Chrome.  I thought there might be more in Safari Developer Tools but came up empty.\nWhat worked for me was to use a network packet inspector (I used WireShark installed through Homebrew).\nWireShark will allow you to examine all the network traffic including the \"Client Hello\" message where Safari lists the cipher suites it supports (the list is 37 items long and matches the list you linked to from Qualsys).\nA little further down you can see the \"Server Hello\" message. In this response the server will respond with the name of the best cipher suite that they both share.\nThe screenshot below is from WireShark.  I have set up a filter to only show packets to and from IP addresses corresponding to 'www.google.com'.  Then I started recording and then loaded the google home page under https in Safari.\nYou can see that the negotiated cipher suite between google and Safari is TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.\n\nFurther down in the transcript (not shown) I found packets relating to to \"Change Cipher Spec\", but this doesn't appear (from what I can tell) to change the selected suite.\n", "Q: Remote login into Windows from Mac using Remote Desktop Client and VPN I am trying to login into my work computer (Win7) which is in a private network through the Remote Desktop Client (RDC) after connecting through VPN. The VPN gets connected but the RDC does not. It tells me that the remote computer might not be connected or switched on, both of which are not true. The VPN is of Cisco IPSec type. I have tried changing the DNS of the VPN but it doesnt help. I am running OSX 10.9.3.Any solutions?\n\nA: I do this all the time and more often than not it is a subtle configuration issue on the PC side.\nBut first (once your VPN is active) open up terminal and ping one of your servers, network devices, workstations or a printer by IP address. One that you know will respond to a ping when you are AT work (EG no firewalls or stealth mode)\nOnce you have verified that you know that connectivity is there you want to verify that RDP works from one PC to another INSIDE your network. EG can you RDP in from someone else's PC to the PC you want to get to?\nThis should start you on the way. The first one to verify your VPN is working right and the second to verify your workstation responds properly to RDP requests.\nThat will significantly narrow down your search to your VPN connection being mis configured or an issue with your firewall and VPN or possibly your workstation having an RDP issue.\nThe new MS Remote Desktop for the Mac works very well (just remember that a two finger tap is a right click) and I have had no issues connecting with a variety of Win7, XP workstations and 2003, 2008, 2012 servers. so it is unlikely that is a problem.\nAnd one more thing, do you have Little Snitch configured to block MS Remote Desktop?\n\nA: One more thing... test your remote connection from another system at work.  It will save you a lot of running around.\nBeing on the VPN you might have direct network access, but it is also possible for your network admin to filter such traffic to keep hackers at bay.  You may have to consult with IT to request an exception for RDP on your IP.\n\nA: I had the issue where I could not RDP over VPN but I could when @ home on same LAN.  Modifying the OS X VPN settings to send \"all traffic over VPN\" fixed my issue.\n", "Q: What machines will OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) run on? Has Apple announced which specific models of Macs will OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) run on and if so, what are they?\n\nA: From Wikipedia, regarding the Developer Preview:\n\nThe OS X v10.10 Developer Preview is compatible with all Macs that are capable of running OS X Mountain Lion and OS X Mavericks.\nThe full list of compatible models from the release notes:\n\n*\n\n*iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)\n\n\n*MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)\n\n\n*MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 or newer)\n\n\n*MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)\n\n\n*Mac Mini (Early 2009 or newer)\n\n\n*Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)\n\n\n*Xserve (Early 2009)\n\n\nA: According to Arstechnica:\nAnything that can run 10.8  or 10.9 can run 10.10\n\nA: Business Insider lists the following Macs as compatible : \n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (mid-2007 or newer)\n\n*MacBook Air (late 2008 or newer)\n\n*MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)\n\n*Mac Mini (Early 2009 or newer)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)\n\n*Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)\n\n*Xserve (Early 2009)\n\n\nA: The watershed for Mavericks seems to be 64-bit hardware drivers, particularly the video card. If your kernel is 64-bit, extensions need to be the same. As video manufacturers tend not to update software for chips they don't make anymore (that would be last year's models) and Apple doesn't (and can't) write all of the hardware drivers, that limits what you can run a 64-bit OS on.\nSo, the compatibility list for Mavericks will likely be the compatibility list for a while, maybe until a significant processor change. As 128-bit architecture won't be happening any time soon we may be good with current hardware for many years.\n", "Q: Can I download xcode 6 without dev account? I don't want to download iOS 8 or so, but I want to start learning Swift without paying 100$. So, is there a way to download xcode 6?\n\nA: Apple won't provide freely a beta of Xcode. Only Yosemite is available for non dev-members. Xcode 6 will be free once it reached a release version. \nThough, you'll be able to find XCode on non legal downloading site... \n", "Q: Rename screencapture program I would like to rename the \"screencapture\" utility triggered with the shift+cmd+3 keys, in order to take screenshots from a program that recognizes and disables this utility.\nSpecifically, I want a different name to appear under ps when that utility is running.\nIs there a way to rename or alias this utility system-wide?\n\nA: I think it is not that easy, but it is possible.\nWhen calling\n\nwhich screencapture\n\nI get\n\n/usr/sbin/screencapture\n\nI enter sudo mode and cd to /usr/sbin\n\nsudo su \n  cd /usr/sbin\n\nI rename the screencapure programm :\n\nmv screencapture capturescreen\n\nAnd after that, I create a symlink to the old one:\n\nln -s capturescreen screencapture\n\nnow when calling capturescreen, It is called capturescreen.\nBut when doing CMD+Shift+3, I get the screencapture process.\nBut You could fix that with creating a Service in Automator and create a Shell-Script-Action, simply calling \"capturescreen ~/Desktop/Output.png\"\nAnd after that in the System-Preferences, Assign a Shortcut to the Service.\nBut you could also simply call Terminal and enter \"capturescreen ~/Desktop/Output.png\"\nEven further, you can modify the screencapture action in automator to get the timestamp back and use it as the main tool for schooting screenshots.\n\nA: Tho you said \"rename\" I'm thinking you mean \"remap\".  You want to be able to use shift+cmd+3 to trigger a different app to take screenshots...\nThis can be managed in the Keyboard System Preference.\nYou can change the current key combination for snapshots and add your own shortcuts for other Apps.\nSee screenshot from 10.9.3\n\n", "Q: How do you turn on \"Dark Mode\" in OS X Yosemite?

Background: I bought a new laptop with Mavericks installed and used Migration Assistant to restore my environment from a Time Machine backup. It worked fine except that all the bungling I've done trying to get a working Python dev environment set up also got restored, along with a bunch of other system level junk I've installed.\nTrying again for a clean system, today I wiped the drive, reinstalled Mavericks and made sure not to check \"Computer and Network Settings\" in the Migration Assistant dialog but I still ended up with a bunch of system level stuff I don't want (e.g. Python framework installed in my user 'Library' folder (not Apple's Python in the System/Library but what got installed from Python.org installer).\nMy question: I'd like to be sure I am starting fresh. Is there any way, short of rebuilding my settings and environment manually to get a clean Mavericks install?\n\nA: I advise the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of the current state of the machine, this time using Time Machine's Exclusions Option to remove the offending files (e.g ~/Library/*/python) from the backup.  \n\n*Holding down CommandR at the startup chime, boot into OS X Recovery and erase the startup volume using Disk Utility.\n\n*Cleanly reinstall OS X on the empty volume\n\n*Once complete, use Setup Assistant (not Migration Assistant!) to restore the Time Machine Backup.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can only restore complete backups -not incremental. The TM backup mentioned in (1) must be a complete backup. \n\n*Be wary of what you exclude and only exclude what is necessary. For example, excluding the /System folder will prevent you from performing a full restore via Setup Assistant. \n\n*Why not Migration Assistant? It's prone to cause problems when doing a clean restore.\n\n*The Pondini links provided are for Mountain Lion. All the instructions work exactly the same in Mavericks and are completely applicable.\n\n", "Q: How to \"un-maximize\" or \"restore\" an Excel window In Excel, I have a window that uses all of the display real estate, apart from the dock area. Is there any way to make it use only part of the display, apart from resizing the window by dragging the bottom right corner of the window, or installing a third-party application?\nI tried pressing the green button in the top left hand corner, and also all sensible combinations of keyboard keys plus the green button. I also examined whether the \"Window\" menu had anything to help do this.\n\"Un-maximimize\" or \"restore\" may or may not be the correct terminology. In both Microsoft Windows, and most flavours of Linux GUIs I've encountered, you can \"maximize\" a window to make it use most of the display real estate, and then \"restore\" a window to make it shrink back to the previous size. I don't know the OS X terminology, as unlike Microsoft Windows and Linux GUIs, there isn't a menu about resizing windows. I understand that the green button in OS X isn't exactly equivalent to \"maximize\".\n\nA: The Escape key un-maximizes Excel. Another way is to push the mouse cursor to the top edge of the screen. The menu bar would appear. A blue unmaximize button will appear in the top right corner. Finally, you can use Control Command F. That should work with all programs, not just Excel.\nIf you have an additional monitor and set up access to it in the \"top\" direction, it will not be possible to \"hit\" the top of the screen to get the menu bar. In this case hit the top corner of the monitor.\n\nA: I think if you hover your mouse at the very top of the screen, a bar will come up with standard menu commands on the left and a small blue rectangle with arrows pointing inward on the far right corner. Click that rectangle. Just worked for me.\n", "Q: Is it safe to install a third party high capacity battery into my iPhone 5S? I stumbled upon this battery on Amazon and I was wondering if it'd be safe to install it into my iPhone 5S, assuming it's actually compatible.\n\n\nA: No it is not safe. \nNot for technical reasons -- That is impossible to judge -- but look at the seller's profile on amazon. They have thousands of items for sale, yet they have a total of two customer ratings; one rating one star the other two stars (out of five)!\nThis looks very much like a scammy outfit that changes its name when it gets bad reviews. Run away. \nAlso: shipping time 20 to 30 days?!?\n\nA: The golden battery with the red 2680mAh sticker is NOT 2680mAh.\nThe original Apple iPhone 5S battery is 1560mAh 3.8V 5.92Whr. \nIf you look at the golden battery label it says 3.8V 5.92Whr  which is 1560mAh\nIf you take the gold cover of underneath you will see it's just the same as the original iPhone 5S battery 1560mAh 3.8V 5.92Whr\n", "Q: Is using Apple products abroad as simple as just replacing the plug on the AC adapter? For many Apple products, e.g. MacBook Air, or iPhone, the power supply is the same for different countries, and it accepts a power range of 100-240V and 50-60H (which I think is a great idea, since it encompasses most of the power standard used around the world; I don’t know whether this is specific to Apple or common practice).\nDoes this mean that the only item which is different is the actual, phsyical plug piece, i.e. the piece which connects the adapter to the plug (note that this piece is actually the same for different adapters, namely different W)?\nIs it then possible to just buy that piece (it shouldn't cost more than a few $$$) such that it has the desired shape, compatible to the country of interest?\n\nA: Apple sells a \"world traveler kit\" which is effectively the plug bit for their chargers, so that would be a definite yes.\n", "Q: Tighten hinge on 27\" Cinema Display? I just purchased a new 27\" Cinema Display from Apple and I'm wondering if there is any way to tighten the hinge that attaches to the stand for adjusting the angle. I'm a DJ and noticed when I'm performing, the display keeps tilting forward on it's own (likely from some slight bass vibrations). I have two 24\" Cinema Displays and the hinge has much more friction than the 27\" - I realize the size and weight is greater, although are they normally so loosey goosey?\n\nA: There are 2 methods to do that.\n1- Mechanical\n2-Chemical\n\n\n*\n\n*for mechanical take the screw out and bring it to your hardware store, they will give you tongued washers or claw washers that prevents the screw from loosening.\n\n\nThe pro for this method is you can loosen the screw.\n\n\n*\n\n*for Chemical method go to your hardware store and get the glue (for the screw).\n\n\nThe negative, it will be extremely hard to remove the screw.\n", "Q: Front camera on an iPhone 4S no longer works The back camera works just fine but the front one does not. When I select it, it just freezes. When I quit the app and select it again it presents just a black screen; no image.

Ever since last year's iWork update I've been hesitant to use it, on the basis that it made it clear that simply opening iWork '09 files would result in destructive changes that would become permanent if saved, and which still wouldn't be restored if exported.\nI'm aware that since that time Apple has also done an update to restore some of what was lost.\nThe question for now is, is there a comprehensive list anywhere that tracks what's going to be lost when opening iWork '09 files in the current version of iWork?\n\nA: Here is the list published by Apple.\nChanges that occur when exporting to iWork ’09 \nAll Apps\nCurved shadows and contact shadows are converted to drop shadows. \nComments on objects are removed. \nAnchored objects are converted to floating or inline objects. \nThe following formulas are removed: INTERSECT.RANGES, POLYNOMIAL, SERIESSUM, UNION.RANGES, WEIBULL.

I've always installed a new OS X install via a thumb drive. However, at that time, I only had a single hard drive.

No need for a thumb drive, right?\n\nA: That should be possible. At least it was possible for previous OS X's, but I don't see why they changed it. So yes, you can run the installer from the second hard drive onto the first one.

I messed up the settings for the clamshell display mode on my MacBook Pro. I can't get my external display to work when I close my laptop. I can get all other modes working (standard mirroring and shared desktop) except for clamshell.\nI've tried using defaults to remove com.apple.windowserver, but that hasn't helped.\n\nA: Neither of the above two answers has solved the problem. Maybe I can move the ball forward a couple of inches ...\nI, too, clicked on the wrong resolution for my external monitor and now I can only use the monitor in \"Mirror Displays\" mode. When in separate mode, the external monitor is black except for a message saying \"DVI NO SIGNAL\". I cannot see the System Preferences > Displays control dialog for that monitor because it's on the black screen. When I return to Mirror Displays mode, I can see that the wrong resolution is set and when I set the proper one, I get both monitors work -- but ONLY if I stay in Mirror Displays mode.\nThis sounds like exactly the problem that @CyberSkull reported, same cause, same results.\nI can verify that Colorsync Utility.app does nothing for resolution, only color profile, and my profile is likewise set to Factory Default.\nSimilarly, the answer about hmscreen is about Arrangement, not Resolution. I looked at the doc for hmscreen and it confirms that it deals with ScreenIDs, screen positions, and which screen is the main screen, not resolution. I'm afraid to try it to set the black external monitor to be my main screen, and that seems to be the only experiment it might be useful for.\nFinally, I found a solution that worked for me! In another Ask Different question, \"change screen resolution with AppleScript\", more than one AppleScript solution was offered (which I didn't try) AND @user332214 posted a link to a utility developed at the University of Utah, Display Manager which worked for me.\nDisplay Manager supposedly has a GUI interface available, but I couldn't find where it had been installed to invoke it, so I used the command line interface. Once it was installed, the command line:\ndisplay_manager.py res 1920 1200 ext0\n\nsuccessfully changed my external monitor to 1920x1200 resolution, my usual, from the erroneous 1920x1080 that I had accidentally set and which resulted in a black screen except in Mirror Displays mode.\nIt works.\n\nA: I clicked on the wrong unsupported resolution for my external display while my macbook was closed.\nAfter trying almost all the solution above (unfortunately none of them worked) I tried to do an easy thing:\n\n*\n\n*Start a videocall on your Mac.\n\n*Share your screen and connect with another device.\n\n*Close your laptop while moving the mouse and you should be able to see the shared screen on your device (even if the monitor still has the no signal error).\n\n*At this point you can just go to Settings > Displays and change the monitor's resolution.\n\n\nA: Open the Colorsync Utility.app in your Utility folder.\nClick on your external display.\nSet the profile to Factory settings.\n\nA: I also messed up my settings and couldn't rearrange since it wasn#T displayed anymore.

Exactly which file do I need to be looking at? I made the presumption that the backup created by time machine would store the uuid to ensure that the physical MAC address (7 layer OSI model) would be the one that received the backed up files of the MacBook Air. Perhaps in Extended Firmware Interface (EFI) folder although I did see a file mentioned; in a post elsewhere which was com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist. The same post also said that a sparse bundle created by time machine contained the hardware UUID (effectively the serial number?).\n\nA: The UUID is not the same as the serial number.\nWhen you use any Mac, some machine-specific preference files are created in your Library/Preferences/ByHost/ directory.  The filenames are of the form\ncom.apple.app.UUID.plist\n\nSo, if you really want the UUID of a previously used machine, you can probably dig it up from some backups in that way.  I don't know how useful that would be though.\nI think TimeMachine stores UUIDs of the filesystem, but not the computer itself.  Checking the logs on one of our servers here, I see several fsUUID and eventDBUUID but nothing for the machine.\n\nA: The serial number isn't read from a system file. It's a hardware information read directly from the hardware. \n\nA: It could be written to the disk if you had previously run the system profiler. This is the same as \"About this Mac\" except information is dumped into the Terminal. You could save the report thusly: \nsystem_profiler > ~/systeminfo.txt\nOtherwise the serial as mentioned is read directly from the logic board and generally not logged to disk.\n\nA: Run in Terminal:\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType\n\nwhich would print your Hardware UUID and Serial Number.\n", "Q: Keeping column width in Finder Is there a way to keep the columns width settings?

Yesterday, I saw that my brother has downloaded an \"hentai\" on my Mac (shame on me, I didn't lock it !) I deleted it, but it stays on my purchased books, and I don't want it !\nIs it possible to totally remove a book from my account's purchased history? \n\nA: If this was bought through the iBooks store, then things will stay in your purchase history for as long as they are available to download. You can try to contact Apple and explain that it was your brother that made the purchase on your account and you want it removed. Also, have your brother pay you back too.\nIf this was just a web download then if you delete the file from your Mac and synced devices it will be gone and bother you no more.\n\nA: It worked for me using iBooks on the Mac.\nGo to the iBooks store. Top left.\nScroll all the way down and select \"purchased\"\n\nFrom here you should see the books. Hover over and click the X in the left side. Works in Sierra.\n\nA: This has since moved from iTunes to within the iBooks app, but the procedure is exactly the same:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iBooks\n\n*Click iBooks Store in top-left corner\n\n*Click Purchased\n\n*Click the x in the top-left corner of the book you want to hide\n\n\nAnd to unhide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iBooks\n\n*Click iBooks Store in top-left corner\n\n*Click Account\n\n*Click Manage next to Hidden Purchases\n\n*Click Unhide below book in question\n\n\nA: so the answer is, No. it will be in the cloud permanently. \n\nA: In fact, I found the answer on a French Forum.

For example, in Finder, when you CMD+C to copy a file, the Menu for pasting it is called \"Paste Item\". Is there a way to rename that simply to \"Paste\" ?\nI'd like to do this for quite a few programs, Finder being only one of them, so if there's a universal method to this, by editing content files or by using terminal for example, that'd be great. \nThanks!\n\nA: You will have to edit the .nib files with a text (or xml) editor. First make a backup of the app (especially for Finder), then go into the bundle contents and find the English.lproj or en.lproj. This will probably be in the Resources/ folder. \nMost likely, this file will be called MainMenu.nib. However, Finder's is MenuBar.nib and some apps, like Firefox, won't have one at all.\nThe nib file can be converted to XML with plutil -convert xml1<filename>. Then you can open it in the text editor of your choice. Just command ⌘+F (or control ⌃+S) for the menu name you want to change. It should look something like this:\n<string>New Tab</string>\n<string>newSession:</string>\n\nEdit the string at the top. This is actually the Interface Builder connection between the menu item of that name and the Objective-C selector/method that it calls. Save the nib and relaunch the application (with Force Quit or killall for Finder) and you should have the different name showing up.\n\nA: There's no generic way of doing that will work on all programs.\nThe generic methods you could use to try to achieve this is to open the applications bundle[1] and search for the files, you think will contain the word, you want to change. Especially you'll want to focus on files with extensions such as .nib and .strings. You might also want to look at .plist or .mo/.po files if they exist.\nYou can then use for example Interface Builder to edit the .nib file to try to change the user interface. There's no guarantee it will work.\n[1] Finder's application bundle is in: /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/\n", "Q: How to install OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) on VirtualBox 4.3? I've seen a lot of variants of this question, but most are pretty old, and don't quite match my use case.\nHow the heck do you get 10.8 (Mountain Lion) running on the latest version of VirtualBox, e.g., under 10.9 (Mavericks)?  I need it for testing.\n\nA: *\n\n*First, you need to buy Mountain Lion (if you haven't bought it already).  Go to Apple's web store (not the App Store app), and search for \"Mountain Lion\", and pay $20 for it.\n\n*Wait 3 days.  Even though they're just emailing you a PDF with a license code, it's done manually (so I'm told), so it really does take 1-3 business days to get to you.\n\n*In the App Store app, click \"Redeem\" (top right on the main page), and paste in the code.  Download the Mountain Lion Installer.  On OS X 10.9, you'll get a warning that you can't downgrade, which is fine.\n\n*Install VirtualBox 4.3.12, or whatever the latest version is.\n\n*Make a new VM image.  You can use either \"Mac OS X (64 bit)\" or the 10.8-specific one -- they both seem to work.  Turn the video memory up to 128 MB -- at the default of 10 MB, it'll boot but you won't be able to see anything.  (I also suggest giving it more than 2 GB of RAM, and more than 1 CPU.)\n\n*To SATA port 1 (the first free one), attach \"InstallESD.dmg\" from inside the Mountain Lion Installer package (right-click in the finder to show the package contents, and drag the .dmg to the file-picker dialog in VirtualBox).  VirtualBox 4 supports DMG files natively, and InstallESD.dmg is bootable.  Check \"Live CD/DVD\".\n\n*Boot the image.  When the first menu appears, open Disk Utility and \"Erase\" your virtual hard disk.  Quit Disk Utility.\n\n*Install OS X on the virtual hard disk.  (Note: don't bother entering your AppleID during the installation process -- it doesn't seem to accept it there.  But once you're done installing, you can run the App Store app and enter your AppleID to download your purchased apps just fine.)\n\n*Be sure to detach InstallESD.dmg before rebooting.  (Simply moving it lower than the hard disk in the boot order setting doesn't seem to do anything.)\n\n*To increase the screen resolution to 1440x900, this answer was very helpful.  (Setting <key>Graphics Mode</key> did not work for me.)\n\n", "Q: Error when mounting sparse bundle from terminal I picked up this command on how to open a disk image and have the password prompt in the terminal window (useful for remote mounting):hdiutil attach -stdinpass /path/to/image\nsource\nHowever, it's not working with this particular volume.

This error is returned explicitly by DiskImages when its kernel driver or framework helper cannot be contacted.  It also often shows up when a device has been removed while I/O is still active.

I'm following best practices yet only getting a couple of hours of time out of a new (reconditioned) 2013 Macbook Pro (Mt Lion) with a battery showing only 10 cycles and near max health on it.  \nThanks \n\nA: Activity Monitor has this feature. It can chart power consumption per process in the Energy tab. You can find it in /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app.\n\nA: The answer to whether there is a similar App for OSX is yes. There are a number of them, but I'd recommend Battery Health which is available for download in the Mac App Store.\nIt shows cycle count, original mAh vs. current, time remaining on current charge, and processes using the most power over time:\n\nAs to whether your battery is defective is a different question. As stated by Apple, your battery is designed to retain %80 of its original full charge capacity after 1000 cycles.

But instead of spending the time to backup my internal drive, I would rather just get a big 256GB thumb drive and install Mavericks on that. I would also benefit from the speed of having the OS on a flash drive.\nDoes anyone see any issues with a solution like this? Since I would be bypassing the internal drive completely as the boot drive, and making the internal drive just another extra HD?\n\nA: Aside from the speed issues that other people have mentioned, you will quickly kill your thumb drive.\nOne thing that differentiates thumb drives from SSDs is the sophistication of their wear leveling algorithms, the amount of over provisioning of sectors,  and the availability to integrate their garbage collection with the host through TRIM commands.\nBasically, thumb drives cannot tolerate as many read/write cycles as an SSD. They have only basic wear leveling and very few or no spare sectors if a block dies.  In contrast, a SSD can have 10-20% of its total flash capacity just dedicated to wear leveling and failed sector replacement.\nAs a result, SSDs can handle over 100,000 read/write cycles while cheaper flash thumb drives can handle only on the order of 1000s.\nOSes designed to be run from thumb drives (like some variants of Linux and freebsd) try to avoid killing their host thumb drives by mounting themselves read only and using a RAM disk as the swap partition and system log partition.\nOSX unfortunately does not have this feature.\nIn the end, you'll have a slow system that will thrash your poor thumb drive to an early death.\n\nA: The main issue I would see is the speed of the USB stick as well as the speed of your USB connection. \nSATA is faster than USB. Way more than USB2, a bit more than USB3.  \nSo in comparaison to an SSD it will be way slower. \nJust so you get some values here is a little video comparing USB2/USB3/SATA/Thunderbolt \nIt can be summarised as following : USB2 < USB3 < Thunderbolt < SATA \n\nA: I would recommend a speed test on the thumb drive.  One simple way of doing this is using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test (App Store).  If it's below ~70MB/s speed either way, I'd recommend against it if you're looking for a speedier overall system.\nIn general, OS X runs just fine on an external drive, but your drive's speed makes a huge difference.  In my workplace, we have OS X on an external USB 3 drive (5400rpm) for troubleshooting purposes and it's achingly slow.  I've got a recovery partition installed on a small USB 3 stick attached to my keychain and the poor thing gets 10MB/s read/write speeds.  Doesn't stand a chance.\nBut to answer your question, no, there would be no issue other than speed.  This functions perfectly fine.\n\nA: No problem other than speed.\nThe SSD has R/W of 400 MBs.\nThe USB has R/W of <30 MBs for USB 2, and about 70MBs for USB 3.\nUSB can newer be as fast as SSD since it uses serial communication while SSD use SATA cable connections.\nConsequently it is Not very practical to use USB as Operating system disk.\n\nA: I booted Linux with a USB2 flash drive at 20Mb/s read speed. The boot time kills the hard drive boot time, even though the read speed is about 1/4 of the speed. This is a result of better latency speed (no time waiting for the head to position itself over the sector). A flash drive is much slower at reading large files, but much faster at reading hundreds of small files while booting.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Imported 32GB of images into iPhoto, 65GB library is the result - Huh? I just imported 32GB of images (my local Images folder) from the past 10 years into iPhoto. I was honestly surprised that the result was an iPhoto library of 65GB. I have no RAW images and am surprised that the space is double what I expect. But on a SSD, this is really taking too much space.\nOne of the explanations though, was that the library consists of iPod/iPhone cache files, preview files and thumbnail files. Those folder minus 65GB results in still 51GB of images.\nI extendedly compared the local folder with the 'show contents' folder from the iPhoto library and I couldn't really find any differences, but the file size of the folders themselves..\nSo who knows how to reduce those 65GB to a regular 32GB or can give a decent explanation.. \n\nA: First thing to know : There is no possibility to reduce the size of an iPhoto library without corrupting it. \nWhat you can do is explore your iPhoto library in ~/Picture/iPhoto Library => right click => show package content. \nIn this directory you'll see multiple directories : \n\n\n*\n\n*Masters : holds in the original of your pictures\n\n*Preview : holds in a low resolution preview of your pictures\n\n*Thumbnails : holds in thumbnails like the ones used on faces. \n\n\nThese 3 directories are the main reason of the weight of your library. The other files/directories are way lighter.  \n\nA: After exploring the imported folder, I noticed an alias file. This linked to a folder, which contained an additional 20GB of images. That, apparently was the boogyman. \nTip if you experience an similar situation:\nExplore the folder and check for links to other folders, hidden files or iPhoto libraries. There may be files/folders excluded from calculation of folder size, but are added in the iPhoto library.\nThis is slightly painful and shameful, but this is the truth..\n", "Q: Which devices can run iOS 8?

I have checked Will my other partitions be wiped when doing a clean install of Mavericks? but I'd like to make sure whether a clean install of Mavericks to my specific OS X partition won't mess up with the rest of the disk. OS X generally doesn't recognize other partitions types beyond the Windows types.\nIs such clean install prone to error even if I take care of asking installation to not touch the partition scheme?\n\nA: If you clear you partition using Disk Utility and then boot into Internet Recovery or install from another location (for example a USB flash drive) you should be fine, OS X will only be installed (and only effect) the partition you choose to install it on at the start of the installation process.\n", "Q: Where can I download Xcode (n) Beta?

Despite cleaning my computer up, nothing seems to be working. I went to the apple store and we ran tests (which I already did) and tried re-repairing disk utility and so forth. (Which I'd already done) & (When I originally used disk utility it would work, now it doesn't work at all) Just says invalid block count and \"repairs\" it. But, I promise you I don't have 30gb left on my computer, especially when it said I have 84 gb. The day before.\nI've had problems before with inaccurate free disk space (even when accounting for Time Machine's Local Snapshots). Usually though I can fix the problem by verifying the disk in disk utility, which then shows Invalid volume free block count and orphaned blocks errors, which I could then repair in recovery mode, but now disk utility repeatedly insists the volume is OK. Which I don't understand at all. All the space seems to be going to \"other\" even with Daisy Disk I don't know where to start.\nI'm trying to install a new version of Maverick to see if this does anything, but the only option the guy from the apple store told me was to wipe my whole computer, and then drag everything back (not using time machine because that may still have the bug on it)\nUltimately, I'm not sure what to do. Should I clear it and then add everything back. I have a giant pain-in-the-rear iTunes library, my office and photoshop are not necessarily kosher either. So all in all, I'm just nervous. Especially because this free space is disappearing quicker than I imagined!\n\nA: You appear to have a heavily-used computer with a 5-year-old drive. I would be more surprised if it didn't have issues.\nTwo things you can try:\nStep 1. Clone your drive to an external drive using something like Carbon Copy Cloner. Do NOT use block copy mode or Disk Utility, that copies the problems as well.\nStep 2. Boot from something else, like the clone, reformat your internal drive and clone back (you can use block copy this time).\nIf that doesn't solve the issues, your drive has hardware problems. Replace it with an SSD and your issues will go away, plus you will get a huge speed increase.\n", "Q: iPhone - what does each number of rings mean? Let's say someone blocked your number one week ago.

It will, however, serve your purposes if you just want to access your READMEs in one folder (using the criteria you've specified), and have some notion of where they come from.\nThe idea is to use your shell script to find the right files, and then collect aliases to each file in one directory.

Clearly think it's a GPU-CPU issue, but obviously they are talking or all 4 LED's wouldn't light up....so it must be something written into the EFI that's preventing screen imaging, I'm thinking.\n", "Q: Colors by file type in terminal (running bash) I'm new to Apple (coming from Linux) and have been stymied in every attempt to use my .bash_profile to get my terminal to color files by their extension (a process which was a single line in my .cshrc file!).  I've had some promising leads via google searching, but all end up having a fatal flaw (e.g., requiring dircolors, which in and of itself has led me on several seemingly doomed google searches, or tweaks on \"export LSCOLORS\" commands which don't seem to get any further than coloring directories, etc).\nI'm on OS X 10.9.2.

Someone definetely should be able to see it, and no matter if I make it 10+ special symbols long or not. I presume this password to be known for anyone.\nAlso my Mavericks by default whenever I need to change system settings or so, asks the same password as I use for login. Which is known for anyone as I said before. So, I want to discontinue this vulnerability.\nQuestion: What's the best way to set different passwords for significant actions and for logging in? What if I i.e. create second profile with administrative rights, then set rights of a user on my current profile and expect Mavericks to ask that newly-made admin's password every time I attempt to do something significant? Aren't there any more convenient ways to achieve my goal? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The way I achieve this is what you suggested:\nMake a secondary Admin account and then take away your admin privileges.\nI'm almost certain that it is the only way to achieve this.\n\nA: You might consider a yubikey from http://yubico.com to get around the initial difficulty. \nIt is a usb device that identifies itself as a keyboard and keys in a password when you press a button, so people cannot look over your shoulder to see you type in your password. \nI don't have one, but I have a friend who does and he finds it useful. His can send two different passwords, so he uses one for system login and one for whichever password vault he uses. \nIf I used my computer in public more often, I'd consider getting one. \n", "Q: Dual booting Yosemite/Mavericks: Stuck in Yosemite with an 'Install OS X' volume instead I've made a partition on my hard drive, so I currently have Macintosh HD (call it 1) and Macintosh HD 2 (call it 2).\nI downloaded the Yosemite installer with my Mavericks install on 1, then ran it and selected 2 as the disk to install on. It worked fairly well and I'm running Yosemite without any problems.\nBut tonight I tried to switch over to Mavericks, so I rebooted and held down option. When the list came up, it contained recovery volumes for OS X 10.9 and 10.10. It had Macintosh HD 2 on it (my Yosemite partition), but not Macintosh HD. Instead of my Mavericks partition, it showed an 'Install OS X' volume. Selecting this shows the Apple logo with a progress bar under it, then boots into Yosemite. \nI can view /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/ and see that everything is still there. \nHow can I boot back into my Mavericks install?    \n\nA: I also asked on the developer forums and got an answer there (iOS/OS X dev account required to view).\nThe solution was to boot into a recovery partition (⌘ + R), and change the boot disk from the Apple menu. It needed to be changed to my Mavericks install instead of my Yosemite install.\n\nA: You can also boot into Yosemite > System Prefs > Startup Disk > Select Mavericks and tap Restart.\n", "Q: How to do Ctrl+Alt+Del via Logitech iPad keyboard This is and old question, but all the answers I managed to find in the Internet didn't solved my issue.\nI am using a Logitech wireless keyboard on my iPad --- \"Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover\" to be more precise.\nI use Parallels on my iPad to access my Windows 7 computer.\nWhen I go into it, I am asked to press Ctrl+Alt+Del to start a session. I am not allowed to disable that option on my Windows computer.\nI have tried all the keyboard combinations, but nothing seems to work. How can I press Ctrl+Alt+Del on my wireless keyboard???\n\nA: If it's Parallels Mobile, you need to use the on-screen keyboard for complex keyboard commands such as this one. According to the documentation, once you bring up the on-screen keyboard, there are arrow keys on the top of the keyboard to switch to a \"function\" keyboard; from there, you can press \"delete\" with both the Ctrl and Alt modifiers active.\nThe Mobile Guide (link) produced by Parallels for this application can help guide you further. (the Page 19 area references the items I mention above)\n\nA: Hold the Command key down on your keyboard for 2-3 seconds until the keyboard shortcut window appears. It's likely that the developers of your app have enabled a keyboard shortcut to allow this to work -- however, this is app-dependent and would not be determined by iOS or Windows, but rather Parallels. Holding the Command key will allow you to see whether a shortcut has been assigned to produce Ctrl-Alt-Delete on the remote computer.\n", "Q: Macbook pro display is messed up, what could be the problem? I have had this happen to my to both my laptops within a week, first my Windows HP Laptop developed this problem which is far more worse btw and now my macbook pro 13 (2011 model). For my Windows laptop I figured it could be over heating that messed up the video card (there is also a noise coming from it also). I do not have enough proof thoug that it over heated. Usually if it lays on bed for longer period, it definitely overheats but we are careful about it. About my mac, it was totally cold. I use it last night (downloaded a torrent) and I shut it down completely. I know it was not overheated because it was in my lap. This morning I turned it on and I see this problem.

I tried restarting and booting into safe mode all to no avail.  I guess this also means I can't run Apple Hardware Test to see if that shows anything.  I've got it connected to an external display at the minute which is working fine.\nIs there anything else I can try to fix the issue from my side before taking it to see a genius.\nCheers!\nChris\n\nA: It sounds like your backlight has broken.  The LCD screen needs to be lit from behind before the screen contents are more than vaguely visible.  If you boot the machine again, and shine a bright torch from the front, you should be able to see your usual screen layout for login etc, but obviously everything is going to be very very dull.  If this is the case, then you can get that fixed with relative ease at various repair centres or through a slew of online guides.\nSometimes on older hardware it's not the backlight that's gone, but instead the tiny starter/transformer that is required to kick a backlight into life, although this type of method isn't used on modern LED backlit screens like your Macbook\n", "Q: Is there a way to extract contents from AppleScript file without using AppleScript editor?

With the task selector open, I can hit shift as well to move back in the same list before selecting app.\nAs soon as I plug in a second monitor (with it's own \"space\" I assume), this suddenly works differently. When I activate the task selector with Cmd-Tab, it opens as usual, but as soon as I hit shift in addition, the task selector closes, selecting whatever was selected when I hit shift.\nOn dual screen I can start the task selector up with either Cmd-Tab or Cmd-Shift-Tab, but as soon as I add or remove shift from it, it selects the application underneath and closes the task selector. On a single screen, I can move back and forth without anything getting selected until I release Cmd-Tab as well.\nDoes anybody know if this is a bug or the way it is supposed to be, and if the latter, what is the rationale for this?\n\nA: samh nailed it in the comments. The issue is the use of an external bluetooth keyboard, and has nothing to do with dual monitors / spaces. The dual monitors are part of my office setup, which also has a bluetooth keyboard. I noticed that when using the computer at home (away from the office), the problem went away, and for some reason concluded it had something to do with the dual screen setup (forgot all about the keyboard).\nThe keyboard is a Logitech Bluetooth Easy-Switch Keyboard K811.

And how do I remove this user's access and restore privileges to me (egbert)? And why is there a disagreement between the Finder and what is reported by ls and stat?\nHelp!\n\nA: Clearly, since File Info lists a joe user, that user is known in some way on your system. Your question doesn't give enough information for an authoritative answer about that. Post a reply if you wish to pursue it.\nYou did not actually check for extended attributes on the file. To check for both extended attributes and an ACL, use\nls -le@ somefile.ext\n\nTo answer your explicit question: you probably cannot \"Choose new owner\" because you as egbert do not have permission to modify the directory that contains somefile.ext. A file's permissions determine who can read, write, or execute the contents of a file. The containing directory's permissions determine who can read or modify the attributes (such as permissions) of, or delete or rename, the files it contains.\nIf you wish to solve this problem and don't care about the reason it occurred, use Terminal as egbert to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*cd to the containing directory\n\n\n*become root to avoid permissions issues:\nsudo _your-favorite-shell_\n\n\n*make a copy of the file's contents:\ncat somefile.ext > somefile_copy.ext\n\n\n*preserve its creation date:\ntouch -r somefile.ext somefile_copy.ext\n\n\n*remove the original:\nsudo rm somefile.ext\n\n\n*restore the original from the copy:\nmv somefile_copy.ext somefile.ext\n\n\n*stop being root:\nexit\n", "Q: Resolution of iPhone photo stream upload!

Read this line in iPhone 2G specification http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_2G\nBuilt-in rechargeable Li-ion battery 3.7 V 1400 mAh\n\nSo, \"Built-in battery\" means \"battery is not user-replacable\"?\nIs that true?\nOr, \"built-in\" means \"hard-welded\" (ie fixed forever)\n& \"not user-replacable\" means \"user can replace if using special tool but Apple does not encourage user to do that\"\n\nA: I presume you mean the original iPhone, and the 2G is referring to the antenna capabilities, rather than the 2nd Generation iPhone (which was the 3G.... yeah, confusing)?\nEither way, all iPhones have a built in battery.  The wording is there to suggest that it is not user replaceable via a simple swap in/out method by removing a panel or similar user appropriate action that does not require disassembly.  The iPhone 5 still uses broadly similar language \"Built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery\". \nYou can swap it out, but it's not a simple job.  Just like cars have a built in engine, you can get that sucker out, but you need the tools, parts and skills for the job.  If I recall, there is a lot og glue involved in earlier iPhone models.  And sticky tape.  It's not just a case of unscrewing some stuff and swapping.  But even then, the glue can be removed, the tape replaced etc etc.  The phrasing user-replaceable or more commonly user-serviceable often means it's a supported solution, and there is no way that taking any iPhone to bits is covered under warranty.\nSo, in short, built in means it's not meant to be removed, but that doesn't mean you cannot do it if you tried hard enough.\n", "Q: VPN to OSX from windows machine?

You can assign any number of email address IDs that can be used for sender or recipient addresses.  You may be able to use an SMS forwarding system to allow receiving of message to multiple numbers, but you will only be able to reply from your own SIM number.\nAs a tangent, in the yet-to-be-released Yosemite version of OSX, it can pair to a phone and send text messages on behalf of it directly from the desktop.

Unless it's your own connection, but I'm sure you checked that :)\n", "Q: Black screen with dual monitors (10.9.3) I have been experiencing a problem with my Macbook Pro (latest version) when connecting it to a dual monitor. \nI usually click on the trackpad to wake the computer immediately after it has gone into sleep mode but ever since I have started using dual monitors the computer doesn't wake instantly. \nI will see the outline of my mouse but the background remains black. \nHere is what the console shows after the sleep-wake up\n\nWhat have I tried:\nTo get around this problem I have just changed the sleep time on my computer but that is only a temporary solution. \nI also contacted Apple support who suggested a PRAM reset but unfortunately that didn't work either. \nInterestingly my roommate has the same problem with his Mac (both are on 10.9.3) so I am wondering if this might be an issue with Apple's dual monitor support and not a hardware issue. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: 10.9.4 purports to fix sleep-wake issues.  I know on my rMBP (pre-Haswell) I'd have a similar issue after disconnecting from a Thunderbolt display, and it's been resolved since upgrading.\n", "Q: Any way to edit Autoping app? I found a free menu bar app (AutoPing) that works well at allowing me to keep a visual check on whether my internet connection is up or down (I live in a country with frequent instability in connectivity).\nHowever, I'd like to change the placing of the numeric output to the left, not the right, of the indicator icon, or if necessary get rid of it, because all I really need is the green or red indicator.\n\nI'm a complete beginner. Anyone know a way to edit such an app in the way I'd like?\nI tried opening up package contents, but I don't immediately see what (if anything) can be changed to tweak the app.\np.s., I looked for the developer, but it ends up being an ISP and though I mailed them some days ago I got no reply.\n\nA: You may find Menu Meters from Alex Harper @ Raging Menace more to your liking. It is customizable, in that you can decide what to display or not. I use it on all my macs.\nIn addition to monitoring network throughput, it can also monitor disk, CPU and RAM. It is also freeware. If you use it, donate to the coder!\n\nA: Geektool\nYou can setup GeekTool to run scripts and print the output anywhere on your screen. Here is an example of a script that pings google and says if it can find it or not.\nif ping -c 1 8.8.4.4 >/dev/null; then    # ping google's dns server (silence the output)\n  echo '✅'                              # when we have succes, echo 'online'\nelse\n  echo ''                              # when we failed, echo 'offline'\nfi\n\nUsing GeekTool you can put '✅', or '' anywhere on your screen. The refreshrate can also be set in GeekTool.\n\n", "Q: What's the difference between \"Empty Trash\" and \"Secure Empty Trash\" I suddenly notice an option called Secure Empty Trash. While Empty Trash is normally gotten by pressing Right Click on the Trash icon, for Secure Empty Trash, we have to only press Command button at that time. \nI also notice that with Secure Empty Trash the System takes longer to empty the trash than normally. Why is that? What's the difference between them? And when should i use \"Secure Empty Trash\"? \n\nA: When you perform Empty Trash the data is not erased from the disk, instead the disk space which was occupied by these files becomes available for the System to use. As the information is still there it can be accessed and retrieved with forensic software and utilities. \nWhen you perform Secure Empty Trash the files' disk space is overwritten so that the information is very unlikely to be recovered. \nSo Secure Empty Trash should be used when sensitive information wants to be completely removed from the disk. If this is not the case just using Empty Trash will do the trick and, besides being faster than doing it securely, could save you in occasions in which you accidentally delete an important file and want to recover it.\n\nA: According to Apple, as of OS X 10.8 (and probably all other releases supporting Secure Empty Trash):\n\nSecure Empty Trash ... overwrites files as they are deleted using a single-pass erase.\n\nThis prevents data recovery after the data has been overwritten.\nThe ordinary Empty Trash command just marks the file areas as available, but does not overwrite them. The data could still be recovered by specialized tools.\n\nA: This excerpt from Tech Republic explains it quite well (emphasis mine):\n\nThe Secure Empty Trash command prompts Mac OS X to perform a\n  seven-pass* erasure of the file Instead of just removing a directory\n  entry to the file or files in question, Mac OS X's Secure Empty Trash\n  command initiates a series of seven different passes in which random\n  information is written to the hard disk sectors previously occupied by\n  that file. In fact, Apple states that this secure erasure meets United\n  States Department of Defense security standards.\n\n*This is incorrect. It's a 1X pass. See edit. \nIn comparison, \"Empty trash\" does not write over the 'deleted' data at all - it just marks the blocks where this data is stored on your HDD as available for use. It does not erase the actual data you discard. \nWriting over a disk even one time takes a while. Simply telling the system \"these blocks are now available to be written over\" takes no time as well. \nYou should use \"Secure Empty Trash\" if you are deleting sensitive information and you want to make sure it won't be recovered in the future.\n\nEdit:\nThat Tech Republic article is incorrect. As Andrew Medico correctly pointed out in his answer, securely emptying the trash performs a 1X pass. From Apple's Training Manual:\n\nThere are varying levels of security offered depending on the number of passes and whether each path uses a specific data pattern or random data. Disk Utility in OS X offers multiple sanitization options for an entire volume or free space. A seven-pass erase option is available that meets U.S. Department of Defense standards (DOD 5220-22M).\nUsers can also initiate sanitization while deleting files using the Secure Empty Trash command in the Finder. This command overwrites files as they are deleted using a single-pass erase.\n\nWhile the Erase Free Space option in Disk Utility offers 7X pass, the secure empty trash feature is only a 1X pass. Tech Republic seems to have conflated the two. \n\nA: Well you see SET(Secure Empty Trash) checks all the files and separate the files you need or don't need. If you accidentally deleted a system file secure empty trash will fix the problem. ET(Empty Trash) on the other hand just deletes it without looking or checking the files. This means although SET takes longer it is less risky to delete files.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts with a single key? Some apps (e.g. Tweetbot) have single-key keyboard shortcuts.\n\nHowever, when trying to set shortcuts in System Preferences, we’re not allowed to do the same. Is there a user-facing way of achieving this?\n\nA: It is possible to do, both natively and easily. Mac OS X hints has a hint (also check Lri’s comment) on how to set up keyboard shortcuts from the command line. We can use this to create single-key shortcuts.\nYou’ll need to know the application’s bundle ID (unless you want to set global shortcuts, naturally). For special keys, @ is ⌘; ~ is ⌥; $ is ⇧; ^ is ctrl. You can also check other values.\nI’ll use Tweetbot as an example, setting “New Tweet” to ⌥+N, and “Reply” (on the multi-shortcut example) to R.\nFor one-shortcut commands, you can use the form:\ndefaults write com.tapbots.TweetbotMac NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"New Tweet\" -string \"~n\"\n\nFor multi-shortcut commands, use the form:\ndefaults write com.tapbots.TweetbotMac NSUserKeyEquivalents '{\n  \"New Tweet\"=\"~n\";\n  \"Reply\"=\"r\";\n}'\n\nFor system-wide shortcuts, use -g, instead of a bundle ID.\n\nA: I doubt that you can have a system wide single key shortcut to do something like a cut and paste for instance, if that's what you're asking. Doing so would cause the actions to be triggered when you're typing an email, for example.\nSome apps allow that most probably because they're programmed so that the single key shortcuts are only detected in certain modes/interfaces. But I could be wrong about Tweetbot because I've never used it :)\n", "Q: Cannot Connect to the App Store I have an App Store update indicated on my App store icon, but when I click on it to go to the App store I get the message >Cannot Connect to App Store   \n\nA: There are two places you need to check, both under \"Settings\": \"Mobile\" and \"App Store.\" Under \"Mobile\", find Use mobile data for: and scroll down until you find App Store. Make sure the switch is toggled to green. Next, go back to Settings and scroll down until you see \"iTunes & App Store.\" Click on that and make sure \"Use mobile data\" is toggled to green. \nIf you are in the US or another region, \"Mobile\" may be labelled \"Cellular\" and \"Use mobile data\" may be \"Use cellular data\"\nHere are two screen shots to help direct you:\n\nAnd this:\n\n", "Q: Error Installing Jekyll on Mac I'm trying to install Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

I've read through all the guides, whether they say to use a Hybrid MBR or create several unnecessary partitions or just use rEFIt/rEFInd, and I'm not sure the majority of the steps involved are necessary. From what I understand, Ubuntu/GRUB2 has supported EFI booting for a long time, and the OS X EFI by default allows for booting from any EFI-enabled partition it finds (as can be seen by burning any Linux live USB with the correct bootx64.efi file). My question is, why is it that every guide available says to use things like rEFInd or an unnecessary partitioning scheme? It seems like all I'd need to do is leave some space for Ubuntu, install it with its own efi boot partition (a normal thing regardless of the computer one is installing it on) and just load it like any other OS. \nFeel free to call me out on being a moron, or to confirm my theory. Thanks! \n\nA: Ubuntu has instructions for most macbook pro's.  Depending on which version of the macbook pro you have you may not need rEFInd:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro\n", "Q: Can I send encrypted e-mail using Mail and self-signed certificates? I want to be able to send signed and encrypted e-mails between a Mac using Mail and another Mac using Thunderbird, by using self-signed certificates on both ends.  I used to be able to do so, but over the years things have gotten more difficult on both ends.  To make the Thunderbird end work, I now have to create a self-signed certificate authority and then use that to make an e-mail certificate.  But I can't get encryption to work on the Mail end.  (I think Apple broke it in Mountain Lion.)  In my keychain on the Mail end, I have the CA from the Thunderbird end, which is marked as trusted, and the e-mail certificate created by that CA, which says \"This certificate is valid\".  But when I create an e-mail going to the other Mac, the encryption button is dimmed.\nI read somewhere that the secret is to add the \"key encipherment\" extension when creating the certificate, and I did that, but it still doesn't work.\n\nA: I can only answer the Mac Mail part of this question as I do not want to test the Thunderbird part.\nI am just writing this part for the people who are not familiar with asymmetric encryption:\nIn this form of encryption you need two keys, a private one and a public one. A certificate in that sense is nothing more than the public key but it has some more information than just a key, it tells who you are, your organisation, etc.\nThe private must never ever be lost and given to others. If it is you have to start over and the person who stole it can decrypt everything, so keep it save and password protected. Usually certificates are signed by so called Certificate Authorities and they most often take money for their service. This is why some people create their own CA and self-signed certificates, which is cheaper.\nThe way e-mail encryption works is that you send someone your public key (certificate) by signing your e-mail with it. You can sign any e-mail, because no harm is done by giving away your public key. Then this other person has your public key and encrypts an e-mail to you with this key. From this point on nobody, other than the NSA with a possible Quantum computer, can decrypt this message in a reasonable amount of time given proper key length. Or some people infiltrate the actual encryption libraries like the HEARTBLEED (heartbeat) bug, which might have been intentional and who knows how many more of these backdoors are there.\nCertificates usually have a limited lifetime and need to be renewed every now and then.\nSo things to take away: You need public and private key and you only give away the public one.\nHere is what I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a Root CA and a Signing CA (you do not need that, but it is what I did) and I used this very good tutorial for it: Multi-level CAs in http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~zmiller/ca-howto/\n\n*Then I changed my openssl.conf in such a way that Mac Mail allows me to use the certificated for e-mail encryption as well.\nThe important bit is to have the keyUsage and extKeyUsage\n[ v3_req ]\n\n# Extensions to add to a certificate request\n\nbasicConstraints = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment,       dataEncipherment\nextKeyUsage = emailProtection, Apple .Mac email signing, Apple .mac email encryption\n\nFor the people who like specs, read this https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2459, but you will not find the MacOS specific parts in it.\n\n*Created the private key and the certificate:\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout <e-mail>.key -config openssl.cnf -out <e-mail>.req -days 3650\n\nopenssl ca -config openssl.cnf -out <e-mail>.crt -infiles <e-mail>.req\n\nYou might argue that ten years is too long as a certificate life time, but I wanted to have something that is working now and in 10 years time or even less this way of encryption will not work anyways. I did not want to renew the certs all the time as I created them for all my family.\nIf somehting goes wrong in this process, you can revoke the cert by:\nopenssl ca -config openssl.cnf -revoke <e-mail>.crt\n\nOne should also create crls, but I did not do that either.\n\n*Converted keys to a p12 format\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -in <e-mail>.crt -inkey <e-mail>.key -out <e-mail>.p12\n\n\n*Imported p12 to the KeyChain on OS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\n\n*Marked it as trusted\n\n*Associated Certificate with mail account in the MacOS Mail preferences under Account Information in the field TLS Certificate. Send mail to other mail address that also has a cert and key and signed the message with my public key, well MacOS Mail did this for me.\n\n*Received the mail and send back my first encrypted mail.\nWhat happened to me when I tried the procedure with my wife was that the lock symbol in my reply mail to the first signed mail was greyed out and I was puzzled. This meant I could not encrypt mails. The reason was that I received the signed mail that my wife had sent to me, but I did not mark here signature as trusted in the MacOS keychain, as all signatures that one receives also end up there. After marking it trusted and restarting Mail everything worked fine.\nMaybe someone or even the person asking can add the Thunderbird part to this answer.\n\nA: Is there a reason you're trying this particular approach? \nIf your real question is how to send signed and encrypted email, I use GPG (through GPGTools).  There is a plug-in that works with Thunderbird but I use Apple's Mail.\n", "Q: Kernel_task using 300% CPU time, high fan speed and slow computer in MacBook Pro My MacBook Pro has become slow lately.

In other words, it's as if the \"Open each file in its own window\" is disabled once I reach 12 open pdfs.\nI can then transfer the newly-opened pdf to a new window by right-clicking on the pdf's thumbnail and selecting \"Open in New Window\" but I don't want to have to do that every time I want to open an additional file. Does anyone know how I can make this happen?\nAgain, I already have the \"Open each file in its own window\" option enabled (and it works when I have less 12 pdfs already opened).\nLastly, assuming this is deliberate on Apple's part (i.e. not some sort of bug), is there a reason why I should be wary of opening up more than 12 pdfs in separate windows? And what other options are there for opening up pdfs in OS X other than via Preview?

Each Safari having his own session, history, cookies, and so on.\nI can do that with two users on my Mac.\nBut doing that in the same user session would be handier.\nHow can I do that ?\n\nA: You can also type in the Terminal.app\nopen -n -a Safari\n\nThis will open an new instance of Safari even if one is already running. Not every application supports this, like Finder or FireFox. Those applications prefers to have one instance running at a time. \n\nA: The best way that I have found to do this is to download Safari Technology Preview. It is a free download and you don't need a developer account to use. It runs separately from native safari and has its own folders for cache, cookies, history, bookmarks, etc.  It is perfect for what you need.\nThe only downside is that it is in beta so you may see minor issues. Although most of the beta features can be turned of the the developer menu.\nFrom Apples website:\n\nRun side-by-side with Safari. Safari Technology Preview is a\n  standalone app that works side-by-side with the current version of\n  Safari, so you can continue to use and reference the current release.\n\n\nA: Safari does not support multiple profiles, so you will have to keep using multiple user account. \nIf all you want is a separate browsing environment with different accounts (cookies) used, you can try using Private Browsing\n\n\nA: Depending on your use case, you could also consider Unite from BZ Apps.  It turns a browser window into a standalone app.  For me, duplicate instances of Safari resulted in combined audio, which did not allow Audio Hijack to record each instance separately.  With Unite - Audio Hijack sees each former browser window as a separate app and records properly.\nhttps://www.bzgapps.com/unite\n\nA: It seems like you'll be able to do this in Safari on Yosemite. Chrome is able to do this by just opening a new \"In Cognito\" window.\n\nA: The Fluid app, like mentioned in the comments, kind of allows this. It is more of a \"single page app\" tool, but it does use Safari under the hood and I use it to stay signed into different accounts at the same time without having to resort to Chrome[1].\nIn macOS Sierra the free version of Fluid allows separate cookies storage, while previously it was a (cheap) paid for feature.\n[1] Chrome is great but uses too much battery for all day use.\n\nA: Chrome has this built in and is well implemented.\nFirefox has a 3rd party plugin that manages this but it isn't as natively supported as it is in Chrome.\nSafari, no.\n\nA: There is an app called SwitchUp that does this, however I think it doesn't play well with Safari extensions.

The issue is only on the Macs.\nBoth are running OS X v10.9.3\n\nA: I have similar problems with users on my network using Mavericks, where no such issue existed with Mountain Lion. Most users can live with it, and they simply re-mount the disk. Apparently, the SMB implementation on Mavericks is different than it was in prior OS releases. What I have found is that if I connect to drives using cifs://servername rather than smb://servername, this pretty much mitigates the issue. This has been true for NAS, MFDs with Windows shares, and Windows servers alike.\n", "Q: Headphones Jack not pluggable into Macbook-pro retina socket I tried plugging in my apple headphone's jack into the socket, but I wasn't able to. Barely 70% of it goes in and the rest doesn't. There is no red-light coming out of the socket, but in the 'Sound' settings panel, the output device is 'Digital Out' -> 'Optical Digital Out Port'. \nThere is no sound emitted from the speakers and the sound icon in the taskbar is grayed out.\nI managed to turn on/off the Analog to Digital switch inside the socket. The other (turn the switch 90º clockwise) solution, I haven't tried yet. The weirdest thing is that there's nothing stuck inside the socket! I looked with a led flashlight, but for some reason, this jack won't go in.\nIs this a hardware issue?! What are the next steps?\n--Edit--\nAdding the picture of the jack and socket and another for the 'Red Light of Death'.\n\n\n\nA: I did this the old fashioned way -- took my 3.5mm connector and hammered it in, using a literal hammer. After doing so, some white dust came out of the port (which I vacuumed up). I'm presuming something was stuck in there? Either way, everything is working now, so +1 for the brute force solution here (at least for me).\n\nA: Ok what seems to me is you have to separate issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*The reason for the headphone jack not going in completely maybe due to a jammed pole. the possible solution for which is either trying to forcefully push it in, or take it to Apple care.\n\n*The reason for the red light being show is cause the mac is assuming that there is a Optical Digital Out connected, which will be fixed automatically once you insert the jack properly. This I know as I had faced the same issue of the Red light flashing and I had consulted and Apple Tech support and he answered this to me.\n\nA: When you insert the headphone into the socket, it makes connections internally against a number of poles which connect to the different rings on the jack end (left audio, right, mic, ground, data etc..).  These are essentially tiny spring loaded contacts which the jack must push aside when inserting, that then rely on sprung pressure to maintain a permanent connection to the ring on the jack.  Here are a couple of pictures, a diagram, and a photo or a replacement part that shows one of the poles:\n\n\nThese poles can jam, get stuck, fail etc etc.  Usually a vigorous insertion is enough to free them, but this is relying on the chamfered edge of the jack to transfer vertical motion into a horizontal movement of the pole.  You could use something slimmer than your jack, and insert (carefully, ensuring you don't insert it too far) before applying sideways pressure directly to the poles to try to get more energy into making them move.\n\nA: The jack is designed for both types of connection - thru a metal wire (analog mode) or via an optic fibre (optical mode) for better performance. \n\n\n*\n\n*Try by removing the current optical PLIST file that is used. Execute the following command in Terminal App: \nsudo rm -rfv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.audio.Au­dioMIDISetup.plist\n\n*Try unplugging and replugging a headphone plug into the port several times. There is a tiny sensor inside the port that determines whether the port operates in optical or analog mode. Plugging something analog in is supposed to trigger the sensor and restore the analog signal. - I used tooth pick.\n\n\nBoth ways have helped me fix such issue.\n\nA: For me, it was a stupid silica gel ball that fell out of a silica gel packet in my laptop case. The ball can be crushed (like glass) and removed in pieces if it's stuck in there. I was able to crush the ball with tweezers and blow the glass dust out.\n\nA: I had the same problem, i had a stuck micro switch that was causing my internal speakers to stop work. i tried everything to release the stuck micro switch, So how i fixed the freed the stuck switch, was with good old WD40, Frist i powered down the macbook pro, then i squirted some WD40 into the headphone socket and then in pushed in a 3.5mm jack a few times in and out, waited about 30 mins and then when i powered back up the laptop, BINGO...my internal speakers where working, so the WD40 released the stuck micro switch. some time you have to think out side the box to fix problems.\nThe 3.5mm socked is sealed so no WD40 when into the laptop.\n\nA: I had the same issue on my MacBook Pro 15\" 2015 for a long time. The built-in speakers initially were working fine up to the point when I decided to stick my headphones in the socket. I wasn't able to do that as the jack was not going in to its full length, just like on the OP's picture above. While figuring it out I was able to put the jack briefly in a position where the headphones would play audio. As soon as I got the jack out though the socket started glowing red and the built-in speakers became off.\nI tried a lot of different advices trying to clean a supposedly stuck pin in the socket but to no avail. The red light kept coming out through the lens at bottom of the socket and it was clear there is nothing stuck in there.\nWhat I did eventually was pushing a jack in there really hard while twirling it a little. Not long after I heard some crunching sounds of what I think might've been the lens. I shook it and this is what came out of the socket.\n\nI'm pretty sure it's not some kind of a candy as it is not sweet at all :). It looks like pieces of what might have been the actual lens glass or some kind of intermediary glass.\nAnyway, I inserted a toothpick in the socket and tried to get all this crunchy stuff out. As I was doing that I eventually reached deeper and at some point it got unstuck. My built-in speakers went on just fine.\nEventually I was able to insert the jack all the way into the socket. When I take it out my built-in speakers go on. I still get no sound through the actual headphones since when the jack is in, the socket lights up the red light. Probably some stuff is still there and prevents a proper contact with the jack. I'm not bothered by this much as by this time I'm used to my bluetooth headphones. Hope this helps. Cheers to @Kevin Ushey for showing us what's possible :)\n\nA: My jack wouldn't go all the way in, and nothing foreign blocking it. Decided to go with the push it really hard method, which yielded a crunching sound and white powder coming out, which I made the mistake of sucking out! Duh! So ended up with gritty stuff in my mouth, which I had to spit and rinse out. However, a bit more grinding with a tweezer, removed the blockage, and the rest of the powder and now I am in business.

I don't know if this is possible or not: I would like to see the history of all the podcasts I have ever listened to. Is this possible?\n\nA: There are 2 options: on the listen now page scroll to bottom and click recently played to view the previous podcasts listened to, even if you have not finished episodes, of every show.\nOr to view specific show episodes go to the show itself and scroll down to the end and view the previous played episodes.\nUnfortunately it doesn’t show the day or times listened to episodes but if you know you listened to them when they came out originally then it isn’t an issue.\n\nA: I am sure the phone logs this information. I have been wondering the same for as long as the Podcasts app came out in the App Store. \nUnfortunately I have failed to find a way to extract data around the play history of my podcasts. I think this is impossible at this time.\n\nA: Probably not what you are looking for, but from in show page you can scroll down to the end and tap “Previously Played” which will show you all the episodes you have listened to for the show.\n\nIdeally you should be able to see any listened episode for all shows in one place, but this is the best thing I’ve found so far.\n\nA: ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DrRGi. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201859\nScroll down to the bottom of the Listen Now page of the ap.

I don't care if it's an actual app or sits in my terminal. \nActivity Monitor doesn't give me all the information I want at once.\niStat Menus definitely seems like a slick option, but that costs $. I use iTerm2/zsh/oh-my-zsh; I haven't been able to find any sort of plugin for that, which is disappointing. \n\nA: There are two that come to mind immediately (since you mentioned iStats Menu).\n1) MenuMeters is a free CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring tools for Mac OS X. It can run in the menu bar just as iStats Menu does.\n\n2) atMonitor offers a better alternative to Apple's own \"Activity Monitor\" and combines the best of the features of many other existing monitoring utilities.

The only option is to click the back button which then shows a blank alias picture with the word Other underneath it\nIf I reboot the computer pressing ⌘Sand then do ls /Users to see the users on the system it only has .localized and Shared directories, which indicates to me that the user was not created properly.\nHow do I correct this so I can have an initial user account?\n\nA: I would hold alt during startup and fire up the recovery, reparing or reinstalling the OS.\nYou could also try to create a user via the safe-start, using the root account, but that might be too complicated. Just try the recovery.\n\nA: I tend to agree with YoshiBotX. Something must have gone wrong during setup. And as you don't have anything installed or invested I would just do a re-install.\nTo answer your questions. There are several ways to create an account from the situation you are in.\nOne would be to create an account from the command line. You can find instructions at MacLife.\nAn other approach would be to run the setup again. You can find instructions to do that at Cnet.\n\nA: Definitely a strange situation, however there's a relatively easy solution.\nBoot to single user mode as you did before by holding ⌘S while power it on.\nOnce you reach the command prompt you can enter the following commands, pressing return after each one:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nreboot\n\nThis will remove the file that OS X checks for when booting to determine if the Mac has already been setup.

That doesn't explain how a hard reset would make it work though.  I would see if you can borrow a friendly sim and tray from another iPhone 5 users, and see if you can get the same results, or improved results, by using different combinations of sim card and tray.  When you get one that works, run away and leave your friend with the duff bits ;)\n\nA: The most certain way to get the problem solved correctly is to take your iPhone to your mobile phone service provider and get them to troubleshoot the problem, perhaps giving you a new SIM card. If they cannot solve the problem, then you should take the iPhone to an Apple Store or other Apple-certified service provider and let them work on it.\nHaving reliable phone service is important; you should let the professionals deal with this annoying issue to ensure that you have continous phone service.\n\nA: As you said yourself: you still have warranty. If the problem keeps occurring I would use that warranty while it still lasts. \n\nA: I found a clever workaround  . just ask Siri  to turn cellular data off\n\nA: I got a new iPhone.

My question is can I repartition my hard drive to have another partition, using disk utility (resize the OS X part and have a new part created with that space)- disk utility warns me I might get kicked out of Windows booting for doing this, and I want to make sure if that's really going to happen.\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes, this is dangerous and uncertain. Just to be safe, and to plan for the worst, expect that all your partitions will be destroyed by the process, and that you may need to reformat your entire hard drive and re-partition it to the new partition scheme that you require, after which you will have to restore your Mac OS X volumes and your Windows Boot Camp partition and restore your Windows installation to that new partition.\nYou had better make a complete backup of every partition to external hard drives before you do anything. You can use the donation-ware utility Carbon Copy Cloner to clone your existing Mac partitions (Macintosh HD and the hidden Recovery HD) to an external hard drive formatted for Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nYou should purchase whatever Windows software is necessary (Symantec Ghost, etc.) to clone your Windows partition while booted into Windows itself. You should clone it to a different external hard drive formatted for Windows NTFS.\nOnly once you are sure that all your partitions are backed up should you undertake the re-partitioning in Disk Utility. If you are fortunate, everything will go well and you will not need to re-install anything. But since you cannot be sure that this will happen, you would be very wise to have backups of everything first.\n\nA: Well, I just repartioned my Mavericks bootdrive to have a second HFS+ partition, and I have a BootCamp partition on the same drive. Worked fine, and I just started my BootCamp partition in Parallels without problem. So it may be possible.\nI would take the advice to backup/clone mye partions beforehand.

I launch applications from the Terminal with commands like this one :\n/Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail &\nThe important part is the &.\n\n\n*\n\n*For Unix / Linux / Solaris : \n\n\n*\n\n*I have learned at school that adding the & makes the program live on his own. \n\n*I strongly remember launching a command like xeyes & and having the program running safe even after I close the shell.\n\n\n*On Mac OS X (Unix inside) : \n\n\n*\n\n*I launch an app with & and I close the Terminal window : the application exits ! \n\n*Why does this undesirable behaviour happen on Mac OS X ? \n\n*How can this be fixed ? \n\n\n\nA: The \"standard\" way of accomplishing what you want to accomplish (on OS X as well as on Linux, FreeBSD or other systems) is to use the command nohup:\nnohup program &\n\nThis will start program, which will run in the background relative to the shell because of the & - and will ignore hangup signals due to the nohup command.\nThis way the program will continue running even though you close the shell. It doesn't matter if you're closing the shell because you're closing Terminal.app, or you're closing the shell because you are disconnecting from a ssh connection to the computer, or similar.\n\nA: Using the ampersand \"&\", you are telling Terminal to run the process in the background of the shell itself. Thus, when you close the shell (and kill the process), the GUI (Mail.app itself) will also close. \nThe correct command to launch Mail from the terminal is simply:\nopen -a Mail; exit\n\n\nEdit: I just found this over at U&L Stack Exchange: What does ampersand mean at the end of a shell script line? The answers provided are excellent and explain exactly what's going on in more detail and better than I ever could! I highly recommend reading through it.\n\nA: When you close a terminal window, it sends a SIGHUP (hangup signal) to the shell, which then sends SIGHUP to all the processes it started. This is traditional behavior for bash and many other shells, and the traditional solution to this is to use nohup.\nThere are ways that different Unix machines can differ, so it's possible that the specific terminal emulators you used or the specific shells you used behaved different.  But it's not specific to OS X.  For example, there is a question on this same issue on Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have found the solution :\n(/Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail &)\nIt is simple, it is pretty, and it works !\nThe parentheses ( ) launch the command in a sub-shell.\n\nA: @jksoegaard has the proper commands but as you mentioned in the comment, it creates a nohup.out file.  To stop the nohup.out file from being created, you need to redirect STDOUT and STDERR somewhere else.  The complete command would be nohup program &>/dev/null &.  This will run your program in the background, ignoring the SIGHUP, and sending all STDOUT and STDERR to /dev/null.\nHowever, if you didn't remember to add nohup (like in your original question), you can use the disown -arh command to mark all backgrounded running jobs to ignore the SIGHUP.\n\nA: Or you can try open -a /Applications/Mail.app\n\nUsage: open [-e] [-t] [-f] [-W] [-R] [-n] [-g] [-h] [-s ][-b ] [-a ] [filenames] [--args arguments]\nHelp: Open opens files from a shell.\n      By default, opens each file using the default application for that file.\n      If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL.\nOptions:\n      -a                Opens with the specified application.\n      -b                Opens with the specified application bundle identifier.\n      -e                Opens with TextEdit.\n      -t                Opens with default text editor.\n      -f                Reads input from standard input and opens with TextEdit.\n      -F  --fresh       Launches the app fresh, that is, without restoring windows.

It can really derail a good day.\nWhat is the most efficient method of last resort for \"clicking\" those elements that have no hotkey, that I can't get any program to provide a keyboard hint for, and that can't be tabbed to?\nMy expectation is that the answers will be methods to move the mouse cursor and click via keyboard (like mousekeys) but any solution is applicable if it allows a keyboard to do anything a mouse can do.\nUpdate Here's a very specific example of something that I don't know how to control by keyboard. In Firefox I'm unable to start this video:\nhttp://vimcasts.org/episodes/comparing-buffers-with-vimdiff/\nThis specific example isn't too important, the point is that even with tools like Shortcat and Vimperator, sometimes hinting isn't provided. Video controls are a good example of something challenging. (Vimperator sometimes works for video controls, sometimes doesn't.) Maybe there's a better way to get hints for these?\n\nA: I've settled on an ultimate method of final last resort when mousing is simply not an option. Karabiner (recently renamed from KeyRemap4MacBook) offers a \"Mouse Keys Mode\" which allows vim-style hjkl control of the mouse pointer and uio for left-middle-right click.

A few other e-mail applications allow you to set their dock counter to the number of messages in the inbox, rather than just the number of unread messages. The idea being that until it's out of the inbox, it's still an active task that needs to be resolved.\nSo what I'm after is the ability to do this with Mail.app in OS X Mavericks. Currently there's only a drop-down preference for:\nDock unread count: Inbox only\n                   All Mailboxes\n\nPerhaps there's a plug-in or some other app that allows you to override the inbox count with the total count?\nUnfortunately, searching on Google for anything to do with the inbox count just brings up hundreds of posts about how the count is wrong/not showing.

This might be a bit specific, but I am trying to test a trashed A1208 Intel iMac (Late 2006 17\" Model). The power supply is dead (Fuse was blown, bypassed with a wire and bang poof a resistor and ic blew), but everything else (logic board, DC/DC Board, LCD) looks good.\nI will be connecting a PC power supply (for testing) for the 12V and Ground, but I do not know what voltage is present on the Power Good signal.\n\nPictured is the Power Supply (Top) and the DC/DC board (Bottom). The Power Good cable is the gold/brown cable, which can be measured at the switcher board rightmost pin (With Ground as the two next to it).\nCan anyone help me out? Most models around the same time have the same type of power supply (Mains to High Current 12V, with 5 Pins, 2x 12V, 2x Gnd, PG)\n\nA: Solved this on my own. For reference this is the information needed. The Power Supply is a 12V 15.5A Power Supply, with an Inverted Power Good Signal.\nLogic Low (Or Floating) = Good, Logic High = Bad (I don't know what voltage level), tells the computer to shut itself down.\nThis forum post from 2013 had a similar issue (weak power supply).\nLeft to Right, when plugged into the DC/DC board (Part 820-1934).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*12V (Grey)\n\n*12V (Grey)\n\n*Gnd (Black)\n\n*Gnd (Black)\n\n*PG [Power Good] (Gold or Brown, Varies)\n\n\nThe 6x2 connector on the DC/DC board goes out to the Logic Board and SATA Harddrive.

Logic Low (Or Floating) turns ON the DC/DC converter's Lower Outputs, Logic High (3.3V) disables it. The Motherboard pulls this High when the computer is OFF. The Harddrive Power is connected to the Lower Outputs.\nThe setup is fairly common. Some newer iMacs skip the DC/DC board and have that all built into the logic board, but still take 12V input.\nI connected an old ATX power supply, with a 12V 7.5A rail, half the current of than the original. It's also out of spec (10V instead of 12V ±5%), so the hard drive wouldn't spin up. I left the Power_Good FLOATING. But the computer booted. Now that I know the majority of the iMac is working, I can order a replacement power supply without worrying about wasting my money.\n", "Q: Can repeatedly touching the screen of a Macbook Air damage it? I have a 2011 MacBook Air. Are there technical/physical reasons why it might be harmful to have the screen repeatedly touched or pressed? Why or why not?\n\nA: Touching your screen shouldn't do any permanent damage (unless you scratch the screen with a nail) any smudges can be wiped off with a microfibre cloth.\nUsing a shirt or tie to clean your screen however can damage it, so always use a glasses cloth or microfibre cloth to clean it.\n\nA: I have had my macbook air for about 5 months now and I have recently noticed a couple white dots on the screen, just a couple. I think this is from touching the screen but i'm not very sure. Im very annoyed...\n\nA: From my experience, pressing the screen can't damage the mac's interior, unless you're pressing very hard on the screen, but scraping the screen with you're nail is bad for your device. DO NOT scrape on the edges of your screen or dig into the bit inside the edge of the mac's screen.\n I would overall advise not to touch or scrape your mac with your nail.\n", "Q: Type backslash more easily on Japanese wireless keyboard In order to write \\ on a Japanese wireless keyboard we have to use alt+¥. Very very inconvenient actually. Especially with Swift, the use of \\ will sky rocket... Alt is bottom left, right of caps, and ¥ is left of delete. You absolutely need two hands for this, and alt is close to caps and ¥ is close to delete so all kind of havoc will break loose from time to time.\n\nIs there anyway to remap this key? Of course I'm mostly using Xcode. Ideally I'd like to remap \\ to  _  which is left of the right shift. Because  _  prints _ both for shifted and unshifted taps, so \\ for an unshifted tap would be great.\n\nA: I was able to download and use Ukulele from http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=ukelele  however while the software seems powerful it's far from easy to use and have keyboards install. The manual is lengthy and takes a while to go through. There's no quick way of fixing things, unless you have a lot of experience I guess. The keyboard layout I created seems to work in Notes, but it does not work in Google Chrome (I couldn't write this comment using it) \nOk so I restarted Google Chrome and can now use the keyboard layout. Seems to work, look \\\\ :-)\nAnd to add something... Ukulele works on an inherent feature of OS X (the keyboard layout files), just adds an UI on top of it. It would be nice with a simpler solution so if anyone knows feel free to add an answer.\n", "Q: OS X Terminal window disappears on launch I just unwrapped a MacBook Pro (OSX 10.9.3). I used the Migration Assistant to bring things over from my old mbp, and most everything seems to be working except something very important: the Terminal app. Well, I actually use iTerm, but they both exhibit the same symptoms: when I launch the app, the window flashes for (maybe) a few milliseconds, then disappears.\nIt's not hiding or minimized. The app is open (in the toolbar, etc.), but no windows will appear. I even tried running an executable bash shell script (*.command), but nothing really appeared and the script apparently didn't execute.\nThis is a very fundamental problem. Is it back to the Apple store? The only other weirdness I've noticed is that the setup when I first booted it was kind-of buggy, and I had to hard-reset it (which really surprised me). However, after I rebooted, it worked fine, and I got it set up as usual.\nEdit\nHere is what the console says when I launch Terminal.app:\n6/6/14 6:46:26.071 AM login[1450]: USER_PROCESS: 1450 tty??\n6/6/14 6:46:26.072 AM login[1450]: DEAD_PROCESS: 1450 tty??\n6/6/14 6:46:26.076 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[173]: (cx.pow.powd[1448]) Exited with code: 8\n6/6/14 6:46:26.076 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[173]: (cx.pow.powd) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds\n6/6/14 6:46:36.241 AM login[1454]: USER_PROCESS: 1454 tty??\n6/6/14 6:46:36.243 AM login[1454]: DEAD_PROCESS: 1454 tty??\n6/6/14 6:46:36.247 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[173]: (cx.pow.powd[1452]) Exited with code: 8\n6/6/14 6:46:36.247 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[173]: (cx.pow.powd) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds\n\nIt keeps repeating similar messages every ten seconds.\nEdit 2\nIf, in my Terminal.app preferences change \"Shells open with:\" to \"Command (absolute path),\" which is \"/usr/local/bin/bash,\" a window pops up that says.\n[Command not found: /usr/local/bin/bash]\n\n[Could not create a new process and open a pseudo-tty.]\n\n\nA: Well can I ask you what default login shell is?  mine is /usr/local/bin/bash from Homebrew, and if I move my stuff from Time machine to a new computer Homebrew is there but for some reason it is hosed, so I need to change the login shell, remove Homebrew, reinstall XCode, reinstall Homebrew, reinstall /usr/local/bin/bash and change my default login shell again.  I might be wrong on your special instance, but it is something worth considering.  In general Migration Assistant works for your data and all the \"normal\" stuff and Apps people have, but any developer/Unix stuff gets broken (or so it is my experience over dozens of migrations). \nPS to change your default login shell go to the Preferences Panel (the thing with the cogwheels icon), Users and Group, unlock if needs be, right click on yourself -- the option of 'Advanced options' will come up, click that and change your login shell.

I have a macbook pro which I bought with OS X Mavericks preinstalled. I have a Mac Mini with Mountain Lion which I want to upgrade to Mavericks. But since the download size is too big, I wonder if it is possible to create an installation disc or better yet USB using the OS X Mavericks already installed in Macbook Pro and use it to install Mavericks in my Mac Mini?\n\nA: You can't \"install\" it, but you can clone an image of the OS on your laptop using Disk Utility and save it to an external hard drive, then restore that image (also with Disk Utility) onto your Mac mini.\nEven better, if you can use Target Disk Mode (requires both Macs have either Thunderbolt or FireWire), you can use the same restore feature in Disk Utility to clone directly between the drives without requiring the external media/image file.\nThis will of course wipe your Mac mini drive in the process and won't give you a clean install.  If you're OK with that though, then it might be an option if you really can't afford the download.\n\nA: Once the OS is installed it can be copied to another system but you will end up with not clean install.\nYou will have to re download the Mavericks, and save it and do not run the install.\nNow you will have a Install package of Mavericks 5.5 Gig.\nWith it you can create copies and bootable USB.\nIf downloading is a problem for you go to nearest Apple store and they will do it for you.\n", "Q: Speakers of Macbook Air 2010 model not working I have a 13 inch macbook air 2010 model purchased 3 years ago.\nIn the past year my speakers are not working. \nThe speaker icon shows fine, but only there is no sound.

Done.  \nCheers.\n", "Q: WWDC videos on Mac I've downloaded a few of the WWDC videos on my iPad using the WWDC app. I've also marked some of the videos as favourites.\nCan I access these videos on my Mac, maybe from iTunes? I found the videos here but there I can't manage favourites and mark as watched/unwatched.\n\nA: Yes - the same videos that were presented on the iOS app are available as video downloads. All recent WWDC content is posted for anyone to download with no developer account needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/search/index.php?q=wwdc\nThe 2014 content is available for download in HD/SD and PDF format for almost all the recent sessions. The metadata in terms of stars / favorites and such aren't portable from the iOS app, so you will have to either keep using the iOS device or make playlists in iTunes / use OS X labels and tags and folders  / paper notes of which sessions you want to star / revisit, etc...\nAccording to Hal Mueller on Twitter, if you run a script to download all the videos, they will take the following amount of disk space for the 2014 year content:\n\n\n*\n\n*HD videos: 31.54 GB\n\n*SD videos: 10.36 GB\n\n*PDF: 0.418 GB\n\n\nI would note, that you will want to check the history of the script. It currently requires macOS and swift and only downloads the 2016 videos. Older versions might still work with older years, so check the revision history of the shell script version of the tool if you don't want 2016 videos.\n\nA: You can download these videos using my convenient bash script, here you go: https://gist.github.com/Blackjacx/6f61570e5eea87f977e5af9abb6a76b1\nPlease leave a comment on Github if you liked it or if you gave any problems with the download. I will fix problems as fast as possible.\n\nA: Open the appropriate link in Safari, e.g. \nhttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/220/\nThen select the \"Resources\" tab. The download links are then available.\n\n\nA: The only way to see these videos it's via Safari.\nAnd you can download each Videos there.\nI don't think there is a way to manage your videos as the WWDC app available for iOS.\nMaybe there must exists a program where you could manage them.\nBut for that, you must search.\nIf i was you, i would download them and put on a file with all the videos and if you see one you could change the name and star it.\nExample : Name of a video : \"blablabla.mpeg\" (Before)\n  \"*blablabla\" (after)\nI know that this is not the best solution, otherwise you could search for an application which will do what you said.\nSorry, about the lack of my answer.\n", "Q: Fix \"Permission Denied\" when copying files Whenever I try to copy all the content of a usb to my Mac partition it says Permission Denied\nThe command I am using is\ncp -R /dev/disk1 /dev/disk0s3\nMy error message is:\n/dev/disk0s3: permission denied.\nI have tried to set myself to super and still didn't work, as well I have all write/read permissions on the hard drive. \nIs there a way I can buffer the copy by coping all the files to a folder then partition. I need all the contents of the usb to be copied and I believe there are hidden files and partitions on the usb that need to be copied. (is it a recovery usb I want to put on the recovery partition i created and no i cannot just create one, this recovery contents important files of mine)\n\nA: You can't use filesystem commands (cp, mv, ls, etc.) on devices (/dev/*).\nIf you want to copy everything, bit-for-bit, from volume to volume, you'll need an app like Super Duper or Carbon Copy Cloner.\n\nA: If you want to copy all files including hidden files that will not show up in the Finder use\ncp -r /Volumes/foo bar\n\nOf course you can replace bar with /Volumes/bar to copy from one disk to another. You may run into problems fixier destination filesystem is not capable of everything used in the source. (For example when copying from HFSX to (j)HFS+ or from HFS+ to FAT32.)\nIn case you really need to image the full device use\ndd if=/dev/disk1 of=destination.img\n\nReplace the /dev/disk1 with the actual device you want to copy from. Replace destination.img with a filename and path of choice or with another real device. You likely will need to do this as root so double check if your source and especially destination are correct to prevent overwriting the wrong disk.\nOther commands that may come in handy for this include rsync(1) and ditto(1).\n", "Q: How to make emoji bigger in Messages I just upgraded to Mavericks 10.9.3 from Mountain Lion and the emoticons / emoji are quite small in Messages. Sometimes I can't even tell the difference between one and another emoji.\nWhen I open the emoji panel they are bigger, at the size I was accustomed to in 10.8. You can see in the picture the size they appear in a message, as compared to the panel.\n\nI've tried making the font bigger in Message's preferences, but the emoji won't change their size either.\n\nA: The only workaround I've found is to use accessibility zoom; old man style.\nThe problem persists in Yosemite 10.10.3 with the new Emoji picker.\n\nA: To make a larger emoji in an email message, I tried this work-around with my Mac.  Copy and paste the desired emoji into Text Edit.  Using (Command +) I enlarged it to the desired size, then captured it with Command, shift, 4 and pasted it into the email. Yeah, it's a pain, but it works.\n\nA: The best workaround might be to copy & paste from a website like http://getemoji.com which shows emojis at a larger size and has a search feature. I assume there are many similar websites.\nIt seems there is no good built-in option, including up to OSX Sierra (10.12.6):\n\n\n*\n\n*The full character viewer that you get to when clicking the icon in the top right of the simpler emoji focused viewer has an option to change the character size in 3 steps (under the gear icon in the top left), but unfortunately it doesn't make a big difference and it only applies to the full viewer.\n\n*Accessibility zooming (ctrl + mouse wheel) doesn't increase the resolution of the icons, so it's not the same quality as emojis rendered at a larger size.\n\nA: While typing in Messages, Mail, and other programs, select Edit, then Emoji and Symbols from the menu bar, and you will see a larger emoji-picker window appear. You can inseet emojis from this larger window instead of having to use the tiny emoji-picker accessible via the text-input field. This is how I get around this problem in 10.10.3\n\nA: In TextEdit, I typed a sentence.  I then brought up the Character Viewer (I don't seem to be able to get to emoji any other way, though using Mavericks 10.9.3 on a 2014 iMac), and placed an emoji character into the sentence--the bactrian camel, in this instance.  I then selected the emoji in the sentence I wrote in TextEdit and went to the Font Size menu in TextEdit.  I chose 36, and the emoji enlarged to size 36.  I then selected again and enlarge to size 144.  Worked both times.\n", "Q: Can my early 2008 MacBook run Mavericks? I have an early 2008 MacBook with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 4 GB of 667 MHz DDR2 RAM running OS X 10.5.8. Can I upgrade to OS X Mavericks? I realize that my early 2008 MacBook isn't on the list, but I have additional memory. Thank you!\n\nA: No you can't, if your device is not on the list. The minimum RAM required for Maverics is 2GB. Increased RAM will not help you.\nBy the way here are the supported devices\nTo install Mavericks, you need one of these Macs:\n\n - iMac (Mid-2007 or later)\n - MacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008), (13-inch, Early 2009 or later)\n - MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or later),\n - MacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later)\n - MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later)\n - Mac mini (Early 2009 or later)\n - Mac Pro (Early 2008 or later)\n - Xserve (Early 2009) \nYour Mac also needs:\n\nOS X Mountain Lion, Lion, or Snow Leopard v10.6.8 already installed\n\n - 2 GB or more of memory\n - 8 GB or more of available space\n\n\nA: Although not officially supported, there are projects out there dedicated to running the new operating systems on legacy, officially unsupported, hardware. \nHere's a promising tutorial.\n", "Q: How do I boot to safe mode in Mac OSX 10.9.3? I followed the instructions here but it did not seem to work. How do I boot to safe mode?

Note that you will need to know your firmware password to be able to reset it!\n", "Q: Make sure deleted photos on an Ipod touch can never be recovered? How can you make sure deleted photos on an Ipod touch 5 can never be restored or found by someone else? \n\nA: Deleting them should be good enough, but due to the iOS sandboxing restrictions, full deletion is not truly possible. However, recovering these photos would be extremely difficult and require extremely expensive software and a great deal of knowledge. After time, the picture files will be overwritten and then be truly inaccessible. Best advice: don't take/save pictures you'll later regret.\n", "Q: Can I save some steps when burning same playlist over and over? iMac OSX 10.8.5\nI am often producing demo CDs for a musician.\nThe steps are\n\n\n*\n\n*insert blank\n\n*scroll to playlist \n\n*right click and choose burn\n\n*click ok\n\n*wait for jingle - this scrolls to the playable CD\n\n*click eject\n\n\nrepeat\nI would like to\n\n\n*\n\n*scroll to playlist ONCE\n\n*right click and choose burn \n\n*get prompted for disks until I am done and click cancel\n\n\nIs there a setting I did not find?

They have a time capsule, various airport express base stations and several wifi networks configured.\nI am delegated to only use network 1 and I am wondering, can the landlord, using airport express utility see my browsing activity i.e. the actual websites and URLs that I visit?\n\nA: In principle they can since it is the same as a public server. \nHowever, if you are using the HTPPS mode then it will become difficult for them to encrypt it.\n\nA: No - the programs called Airport Utility have no direct logging or monitoring tools.  \nThat doesn't mean someone that administers your network can't log everything you do (they can since they control the network and can direct your traffic to a tool that will log it), just that the tool to do that directly isn't Airport Utility or the software on Airport routers. \n\nA: A general and easy to understand basic answer is if they really wanted to, they could. If not though no, the software alone only allows them to see what you are doing at THAT time but they cannot see your history.\n", "Q: 3rd party videos in iOS app, legal issue? If I were to make an iOS app that whichs primary function is to play specific 3rd party YouTube videos, is that okay to do without asking for their permission? Or do I need to have a legal agreement with each publisher?\n\nA: There is a setting in youtube called public. \nThat means anyone can view it, including downloading or from other apps ect.\nIf the owner wants to prevent that he/she can do that in youtube settings.\nAs long your app is not breaking the youtube T&Cs and you are fine.\nConsider following: many websites contain link to youtube and many even allow embedding the videos, so it is up to the owner to allow or not.\n", "Q: photo transfer from ipad 2 to windows xp laptop how can i transfer photos from iPad 2 to Windows XP laptop?\nI tried all searches related to my problem but no use.\nNone of the windows office can connect to ipad 2 and the ipad 2 does not trust on windows xp\n\nA: In old days to share with others (before the synchronization age) you used places like photo share, photo boot, dropbox, google drive and so on.\nYou would upload your photos to one of those places then access from Windows XP and download them.\n", "Q: Apple ID Conflict With iCloud Locked iPhone I recently decided to restore my iPhone to the latest iOS 7.1.1 and got stumped by a serious problem. It’s an iPhone 5 and when I got it, I had it linked with an Apple ID/email that I no longer have access to.\nI decided to change the account linked with the Find My iPhone app on my iPhone to an email/account I now have access to. On attempting to restore my iPhone, I get a message that my iPhone was setup with the previous account and I need that account's Apple ID and password to activate my iPhone. The Apple ID is masked but I can still remember some string of text of the Apple ID email, but not the password. I have no idea what to do, I have searched and searched for a way to contact Apple by mail all to no avail.\nThe iPhone is mine and already has Find my iPhone linked to the new account but was first activated with the old Apple ID. I'll really appreciate if anyone can point me in the right direction on how to contact Apple.\n\nA: You can contact support in three possible ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*by phone\n\n*by chat\n\n*or you can even try this online support request\n", "Q: How to download additional text-to-speech voices for later installation?

The recovery partition downloads and installs the O/S for you, no terminal needed. Unless you want to do it that way as an exercise in technical exploration, this method was developed to eliminate shipping recovery media with every Mac and make the process as easy as possible.\nOnce that O/S version is on your Mac you can then upgrade/update to the latest version of Mavericks\n\nA: To execute inside the Install OS X Mavericks.app/Contents/MacOS folder use \"./Install OS X Mavericks\" (with quotes because has spaces in it) but it looks like the installer thinks it's reinstall that will not read the installation files in the drive. It will simply redownload the components required (5GB again)\nThe SD Card/Flash Drive/'whatever that you plug in it' is already mounted in Recovery mode. To get there try cd -P /Volumes then do ls. You should then see your drive name.\nDo cd <drive_name> and you will then in your SD Card/Flash Drive root.\nInside the .dmg file I found Install OS X Mavericks.app/System/Installation/CDIS/OS X Installer.app. I haven't test it yet because I'm fixing my friend's Mac when I'm at his house which I'm not now. You can try executing that (Contents/MacOS/OS X Installer).\n\nA: Try this find the InstallESD.dmg inside the Install OS X Mavericks.app should be in the SharedSupport dir and mount it, then find the BaseSystem.dmg inside the mounted OS X InstallESD and mount that.\nthen run the cmd sudo /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/System/Installation/CDIS/OS\\ X\\ Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/OS\\ X\\ Installer /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Install\\ ESD/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg you might have to prefix the volume you want to install onto at the end of the command cant quit remember but I have used this cmd before to install OS X from the terminal.\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS has color depth of 24-bit color or 18-bit color? I don't understand why Apple did not disclose all the detailed specifications. On apple site, it only tells the most basic specs not all specs so Wikipedia has to search iPhone specs in other sources.\nFor example, rhe wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone said iPhone 3Gs has \ncolor depth of 18-bit color while http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_3GS said 24-bit color.\nHave anyone who did use both 3Gs & 4 or 4s?  Did u see the picture clearer in 4 than in 3GS?\nSo which color depth does iPhone 3GS have?\n24-bit color or 18-bit color?\n\nA: i found the answer, iPhone 3Gs use 24-bit Emulation color not the 24-bit true color.\n\n18-bit:  Almost all of the least expensive LCD displays (such as typical\n  twisted nematic types) provide 18-bit color (64 × 64 × 64 = 262,144\n  combinations) to achieve faster color transition times, and use either\n  dithering or frame rate control to approximate 24-bit-per-pixel true\n  color,[12] or throw away 6 bits of color information entirely. More\n  expensive LCD displays (typically IPS) can display 24-bit or greater\n  color depth.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-bit_color#True_color_.2824-bit.29\nNote: 18-bit color display was used either dithering or frame rate control to simulate 24 bit (16.76 million colors) per pixel true color; yielding sub-optimal color accuracy and often having poor viewing angles (http://techreport.com/review/23204/tr-summer-2012-system-guide/14)\nSo correct answer is 24-bit emulation color.\n\nA: Your question is vague, but I could at least try to respond to all 4 of your questions individually.\n\nHave anyone who did use both 3Gs & 4 or 4s? Did u see the picture\n  clearer in 4 than in 3GS?\n\nYou're looking for someone which has been using an iPhone 3GS, 4 and 4s. Please bear in mind that iPhone 4 (and newer) has a retina display and 3GS does not have a retina display. The iPhone 4 has a 24-bit color.\n\nSo which color depth does iPhone 3GS have?\n24-bit color or 18-bit color?\n\nI don't know what you'd like to know about the color depth, just which one is which? Or what do you want to check?\nAccording to this site, the iPhone 3GS is 18-bit color.\n", "Q: What is the icon on the desktop after I install an application? I am very very new to Mac. Here is my question:\nI have downloaded VLC player and then I clicked on the dmg file. I moved the VLC icon to Applications folder in the opening window.\nNow when I start Spotlight and type VLC I can open the app which is great. But there is also an icon on the desktop. What is this? \nIt looks like a hard drive icon but I am not sure. When I right click on it I see: \nKind: Volume\nDisk image: /Users/kt/Downloads/vlc-..dmg\nFormat: Mac OS Extended\nCapacity: 134 MB\nAvailable: 13 MB\nAnyway what is this file? \nIs it like a Windows shortcut? \nIs it the file I downloaded in the first place? (But it was downloaded do \"Downloads\" folder)\n\nA: This is the downloaded disk image. Many applications downloaded from the internet will come as an internet ready disk image, which means that it mounts and opens when the downloaded file is opened.\nA disk image is a mountable image of any volume. Disk images can be images of physical volumes or virtual disks. Like a zip, dmg disk images can be compressed (and usuall are, especially internet ready disk images such as the disk images used to install software from the internet) or can be read/write like an actual disk. They are mounted in the same mount point as physical disks, but are virtual. When unmounting, the disk is ejected and the mount point deleted like a physical disk. As the disk image is a disk, it will be shown on the desktop if you have the relevant option selected in Finder preferences:\n\nCopy the app to your /Applications folder (or wherever else you desire) then eject the disk image by right-clicking and selecting Eject (or through Finder). The mounted disk image is the .dmg that you downloaded, therefore can be deleted by deleting this disk image after unmounting.\n", "Q: I need to reset my old iPad, but forgot restrictions passcode and don't have an iTunes backup I found an old iPad 2 generation (what I don't use anymore) and wish to gift it to my parents.\nA lot of personal data on this iPad.\nI need to reset my old iPad, but forgot restrictions passcode and don't have an iTunes backup before restrictions passcode.\nHowto reset iPad with factory settings?\n\nA: Within iTunes make a manual backup of the old iPad.
