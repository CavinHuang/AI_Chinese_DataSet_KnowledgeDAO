Can either use the .App or add the Applescript manually. Will add a New File widget to the Finder toolbar.\n\n\nA: If you have the Finder window open, use Spotlight to open TextEdit. When you're ready to save the file, option+drag the text file icon from the title bar of TextEdit into the Finder window where you want to save it.\n\nA: Reading through the previous answers, I decided to make a little AppleScript applet you can add to the toolbar in Finder. When clicked, it creates a new blank file in the current directory, letting you rename it immediately – just like in Windows.\nIn the future, I plan to implement it also as a Finder extension.\n\nA: Here is my workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do this once, create an empty text file in your desktop to serve as template.\n\n*Opt/Alt-drag this file to the folder to make a copy.\n\nA: I use PathFinder as a replacement for Finder and it includes this in its right-click context menu. It is prboably too expensive a solution just for this but if you want to have a better Finder for other reasons as well.\n\nA: There are two useful utilities that you can download and install that will enable you to create a new text file (or RTF file) in a currently-open folder that you are viewing using the Finder.\nThe utilities are called NewTextFileHere and NewRTFHere and can be downloaded from\nhttp://mac.softpedia.com/developer/Jonas-Wisser-37498.html\nIcons for either of these apps can then be included on all of your Finder windows.\n\nA: I just downloaded New File menu (2$) from the app store and it seems to work fine. \n\nA: You can use the Easy New File Creator, a free app for macOS.\nUsing Easy New File Creator, a finder extension you can add create new file functionality in the Finder context menu. You can customise the file name and extension for file to be created.\n\nA: On the mac in finder, select a .txt file, hold option and drag it to make a copy, then edit it as usual. \n\nA: This is one of the many things that BetterTouchTool does for me. It has a pre-defined action \"Create New File in Current Folder\" for this.\n\n\nA: Amazing demonstration @Andrew Swift. I would add a few things to the script. First, add \"at insertion location as alias\" to cover the desktop. Second, ((current date) as string) as part of the file name to ensure that you can create multiple empty text files with different names (Timestamps are cool) \non tell application \"Finder\"\n    set txt to make new file at insertion location as alias with properties {name:\"New_text_\" & ((current date) as string) & \".txt\"}\n    select txt\nend tell\n\n\nA: There's two ways to do this, the easiest is the first option;\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit and type whatever you need into it then save it to the location you want the file to live.\nYou can open TextEdit quickly by invoking Spotlight and being typing Tex..., you should see the top hit is the app you want so you can just press enter to open it.\n\n\n*This is more involved and will require you to create an AppleScript.  The contents of the script needs to be:\ntell application \"Finder\" to make new file at (the target of the front window) as alias\nExport the script as an Application somewhere safe and make sure you tick Run Only when saving it.  Then drag the resulting file to the toolbar in Finder\nThis will then allow you to create a blank text file in what ever window you're viewing in Finder called untitled which you can then double click to edit in TextEdit\nThe Ultimate Beginner’s Guide To AppleScript, is good if you want to know more about AppleScript.\n\nA: \nCheck my answer at - SuperUser.\nNOTE: After the introduction of SIP, this app does not work unless you disable it. Read more on how to do it, but it is ill-advised.\n\nTry XtraFinder.\nThis app is just great, solved all my basic needs after switching from a windows platform like adding \"New File\" in context menu and finder toolbar, etc. Some of the features as listed on their website are -\n\nXtraFinder add Tabs and features to Mac Finder.\n• Tabs & Dual Panel.\n• Arrange folders on top.\n• Cut & Paste.\n• Global hotkeys.\n• \"Copy Path\", \"Show Hidden Items\", \"Hide Desktop\", \"Refresh\", \"New File\", \"Copy to\", \"Move to\", \"New Terminal Here\", \"Make Symbolic Link\", \"Contents\", \"Attributes\", … .\n• Legacy label for OSX 10.9 & 10.10.

It has native os x icon style which looks good on retina screens also. Here is a screenshot of my finder toolbar -\n\nPs. this app is also free!\n\nA: This article from MacWorld indicates how to create a service that creates a new text file.\n\nA: Open Finder and navigate to Applications. Locate TextEdit.app and open it. Select Format--->Make Plain Text (this can also be done using Shift+Command+T). Select File--->Save... and you can save this as a real empty plain text file of 0 bytes.\n(I am using macOS Catalina now and saw that there were no clear, simple answers to this question, so I decided to post this as an answer.)\n\nA: Mac being mac, this is the simplest I could think of, out of the box:\n\n*\n\n*Right click on folder, select Services > New Terminal at Folder\n\n*On terminal type touch yourfile.txt\n\n*Cmd+Q on terminal\n\n\nA: My method to make an empty text file is crude but simpler:\nSimply create a new text file in TextEdit, then save as Rich Text Format \"whatever.rtf\"\nThen press cmd-shift-T to convert it to plain text.\nSay yes when the dialog box pops up asking to confirm change.\nAnd you're done.\nP.S. Once you have changed it to a .txt file. You can then edit it with any text editor and save it and it will remain a .txt file.\n\nA: On macOS, applications create files, not the Finder.\nSo to create a file (or a text one), you need to use an App creating one; for example TextEdit, BBEdit, TextWrangler, etc.  \nTo save the file, you call 'File > Save'. This is standard on macOS and all apps have it.\n'File > Save' offers a dialogue for you to enter a name to your file and to choose the folder in which to save it to. \nTo save in a specific folder without the need of navigating to it previously:\n\n\n*\n\n*open the folder in which you want to save your (text) file in the\nFinder\n\n*while editing your file… call 'File > Save' and drag the folder\nicon from the open window in Finder to the 'Where' popup of the Save\ndialogue: \nThis changes the location where the file will be saved.\n\n*click on 'Save'.\n\n\nIf the file was already saved, to move a file you can call 'File > Move' and proceed similar to above. \n\nA: Create a text file using TextEdit\n\n*\n\n*Open the TextEdit app on your Mac (Applications > TextEdit, or use Spotlight, press Command-Space bar, to search, find and open TextEdit). TextEdit is a text editing and word processing tool that comes with your Mac.\n\n*In the TextEdit app, choose File > Open. TextEdit has two format modes: (a) plain text (.txt file) and (b) rich text (.rtf file). The difference is that .txt mode will not allow formatting, while .rtf mode will let you format like adding images, colors, tables etc.\n\n*Default format is rich text format. You can change this by going to TextEdit > Preferences and select Plain Text.\n\n\n*You can also change the mode while you editing your text by going to Format > Make Plain Text or Format > Make Rich Text. If you change a .rtf file (rich text) to .txt file (plain text), your document will lose all formatting options.\n\n\n*Create and edit your text file\n\n*And then go to File > Save to save your text file.\n\n\n*Name your file and save it.\n\nFound this useful guide from macReports website.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I spotlight tex, which will immediately suggest TextEdit.app, hit enter, edit my document and navigate to the directory and Save it.\n\nA: Have a PC with Windows on board.\nIn Windows Explorer, right-click inside any folder, choose Create text file. It creates the file.\nUpload the file to any cloud service, or attach to a letter.\nOn your Mac, download the file wherever you want.\nProfit!\n\nA: Another workaround is to visit for example https://www.editpad.org/ and download a .txt file\n", "Q: OS X dialogs: Can I use 'Enter' to invoke the *currently selected* button instead of the default one?

I'm looking for a way to have AppleTV (Version 2) output from optical out only without having HDMI connected or at least with the TV turned off. I've read that this is possible with previous versions. Is there a patch for nitotv or a jailbreak distribution that supports this feature? Or this is impossible?\n\nA: I've got an unjailbroken Apple TV (2nd gen) running Apple TV Software 5.2, and it does permit audio through the optical out, even when my TV is off or when the HDMI cable is disconnected.  I have my Apple TV connected to my LG TV via HDMI and to my Onkyo receiver via S/PDIF (TOSLINK) optical out.  I tried these scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*Base case: Everything connected, TV on, AirPlay works and audio is transmitted from optical out to the receiver.  The TV also receives audio over the HDMI, though I usually keep the TV's volume muted. (FWIW, I was used the Music app on my iPad to initiate AirPlay audio.)\n\n*Next case: TV off and HDMI not connected (headless).  I unplugged my Apple TV's power cord, removed the HDMI cable, and then plugged the power cable (only) back in, forcing a reset.  After a few minutes, I was able to use AirPlay to stream audio to the Apple TV and could hear it from the receiver via the optical output.\n\n*Next case: TV off and HDMI is connected.  I unplugged my Apple TV's power cord, plugged the TV HDMI cable back in to the Apple TV, and then plugged the power cable back in, foricng a reset.  After a few minutes, I was able to use AirPlay to stream audio to the Apple TV and could hear it from the receiver via the optical output.\n\n*Next case: Unplugging/plugging the HDMI cable while AirPlay audio is streaming already.  I tried this out of curiosity to see how the Apple TV would behave, e.g. would it get stuck?  When I inserted/removed the HDMI cable, audio to the optical output stopped for a few seconds, then resumed.\nAs to why your Apple TV might not output audio to optical without the TV on, I have a couple of theories:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some TV sets, when the HDMI is connected and the TV is off, could interfere with the device's normal operation.  I used to own another TV, and my cable company's set-top box would routinely complain that its HDMI output was \"blocked\" when that TV was off, and it wouldn't permit playback through other outputs unless I turned on the TV or disabled the HDMI.  If you can't get AirPlay to work when your TV is off,  try the headless / no HDMI case #2 above.\n\n*Were you perhaps trying to initiate AirPlay after your Apple TV was idle for a long time or else put into standby mode?  Wake the Apple TV first with the remote and then try initiating AirPlay.  (Notice in each case I tried above, I had power-cycled the Apple TV prior to changing the cable configuration, and such power-cycling guaranteed the Apple TV was awake.)\n\n*How is your receiver set up?  In my setup, I have my Apple TV's optical output going to a dedicated device input on the receiver (DIG 2), and the TV's HDMI pass-through to another device input (DIG 3/TV).  (My TV's HDMI pass-through doesn't pass anything through the HDMI cable when the TV is off, hence why I use the optical output in the first place ... that, and the TV seems to boost & distort the audio.)\n\n*Perhaps the issue is media/settings specific.  Do your Apple TV's audio settings enable Dolby Digital output, and your receiver, perhaps, isn't capable of interpreting the signal?  Try turning this option off.\nAdditional links at Apple that may be helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple TV: HDMI audio stops working and related questions\n\n*Apple TV (2nd generation): No audio when using Apple TV and related questions\n", "Q: Is it possible to launch a Linux application running under Parallels from OS X? I am looking for a way to launch an individual application (e.g. Firefox) on my Ubuntu installation which is running under Parallels.  I am open to any method of launching such as a shortcut (like how Windows applications can be launched under Parallels), shell script, AppleScript, etc.\nAt this point in time I am just not sure this is even an option.\n\nA: Here are some conceptual answers that would work, and potentially can be expanded to launching any app in any virtual machine space, although insecurely.\nMethod 1.  Drop boxes.\nEach VM has a shared directory from the host machine.  This directory must be publically writeable.\nA script on any machine can write a file to any of these directories.\nEach VM monitors its directory, and when the file has been closed, it immediately executes it, and deletes the file.\nThis is incredibly insecure.  At minimum the execution program should be limited in what programs it can run.\nMethod 2.  Ssh.\nIn general the command is\nssh user@hostname -c \"Command line and parameters in quotes\"\nThis can be implemented MUCH more securely\nMethod 3.  Netcat.  Might be more valuable if you had a semi-continuous stream of commands from machine A to VM machine B.  The output of netcat on the client machine could be fed to bash.  This gets trick for getting the results back, as backgrounded shell commands will have overlapping results.  However if you were happy with command line results, then a simple ssh to the VM would be sufficient.  \nI expect other people to improve this answer, but it may give you things to start to tinker with.\nI would have entered this as a comment and not an answer, but comments are too small.\n", "Q: Where has my Podcast playlist on my iPhone Gone? Where have my podcasts gone from my playlists on my iPhone??? I used to be able to put my podcasts into a playlist in iTunes, but now they don't seem to go onto a playlist and can only be played via the Podcast app. This is terrible as you can't organize or loop  podcasts, and is dangerous whilst driving as you have to look at the phone after every episode is finished.\nIs there a way to organize my podcasts?\n\nA: Delete the Podcasts app, and you'll be able to play them through the Music app again. Some people have had to reboot their devices to get them to show in Music; turn the iPhone off then on again.\n\nA: Compromise workaround (with issues): Switch 'media kind' from 'podcast' to 'music'.\nThis allows you to play podcast playlists from the Music app on your iOS device, but it makes for the following issues in iTunes on your computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Podcasts may disappear from the Podcasts library and show up in the Music library, but not always. Some will show up in both places.\n\n*The \"Download\" option in the right-click menu no longer appears and although the cloud/download icon still shows up it is not functional. These will work as expected if you switch back to 'podcast'.\n\n*It becomes difficult to easily tell what media kind a podcast is. If you right-click on a podcast, those converted to 'music' will show \"Song Info\" instead of \"Get Info.\" View>Show View Options lets you add a file kind column, but this is different than 'media kind'.\n\n*If you select multiple podcasts with mixed 'media kind' you will not be able to use Get Info to edit the details. When you try you'll see this message\n\n\n*\n\n*Your selection contains more than one kind of media. All items must be the same kind in order to view or edit them together.\n\n\n\nRecommended workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the podcasts in iTunes\n\n*Put the new podcasts in a temporary playlist (to ensure you don't have mixed 'media kind' attributes)\n\n*Switch to the playlist, select all the podcasts, right-click, Get Info, Options tab, change 'media kind' to 'Music'\n\n*Move podcasts to your podcast playlist\n\n*Connect your iOS device to iTunes, click on it in the upper left, under \"Settings\" in the left pane click Music, make sure that either\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Entire music library\" is selected in the \"Sync Music\" section, or \n\n*Click the checkbox next to your podcast playlists in the \"Playlists\" section\n\n\n*Sync the iOS device\n\n*On the iOS device open the Music app, tap Library in the lower left corner, choose Playlists, play\n\n\nThe workarounds mentioned in Podcast playlist not syncing no longer work for me.\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using iTunes 12.7 on Windows and iOS 11.2.2.\n\n*This leaves the 'genre' as Podcast so they will remain grouped in the Music library.\n\n", "Q: How can I create a stand alone APP to run a terminal command I have the requirement to manually run the OSX maintenance scripts in OSX (Lion / Mountain Lion).

You will need to enter administrative credentials each time still, as I'm sure the password could be different on each system you use.\n\n\nA: The answer by bispymusic should work well, but an even simpler answer (fewer layers of program to launch) would be to open AppleScript Editor and create a New script. The script is the same as above:\n do shell script \"periodic daily weekly monthly\" with administrator privileges\n\nSave the script as an application. Done. Automator is great, but in this case, it's just calling an AppleScript, so we can cut out the automator middleman and just create an AppleScript directly.\nThis should meet all five of your requirements, with the technical caveat that both the automator script and the AppleScript application are technically folders and not single file.

It treats it as Command + {\nI'm trying to use standard dvorak, not the Dvorak-Qwerty (not that I want to either) though it has the exact same issue.\nIt happens in both Netbeans and PHPStorm which leads to believe that this may be a mac issue and not an IDE issue. It's pretty frustrating trying to code when some keyboard shortcuts aren't working. While some like Command + C,V,Z work just fine.\nHow do I get these keyboard shortcuts to work as they do in any other operating system?\n\nA: I'll repost here my answer from SO to the same problem:\nIt turns out this is a problem in Java that has existed for some years, and is still present in Java 9. See the bug report here: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8022079\nJetBrains has been aware of the problem for some years, but is waiting for Oracle to fix it. See these JetBrains bug reports: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-6493 and https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-63779\nIn those reports you'll find a work-around using a free tool called Karabiner. I have just verified that it works for IntelliJ. It will probably also work for other Java-based tools.\nThe work-around is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install Karabiner from https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\n\n*In the OSX System Preferences, set your keyboard to the default \"U.S. International\" PC. If you don't often type diacritics and other international characters, it's easier to just set the keyboard to \"U.S\" instead.\n\n*In the Karabiner settings, type \"dvorak\" in the search box, then scroll down to the section For U.S. Input Source and check Ùse Dvorak Keyboard Layout (QWERTY to Dvorak)`\n\n\nA: OK - I've just downloaded NetBeans and I see the same issue.  \nI think that this may be a JAVA issue, as both the IDEs you mentioned are JAVA applications.  Cocoa apps such as TextMate seem to work fine. \nIt may not be the answer you want - but if you want to use the Dvorak layout and have modifier keys work correctly, use an IDE that's not written in JAVA.\n\nA: I have seen a similar problem with Xcode and the Norwegian keyboard. In a previous question, the OP said that his comment shortcut does not work, and that the shortcut icon disappeared from the drop-down in the OS X navbar. \nWhat seemed to work was to re-map the keys to something else as a workaround. The way was that you go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, then to App Shortcuts, add a new shortcut. Make the menu title exactly match the one in the OS X dropdown, and map the keyboard shortcut.\n\nLet's say I for example wanted to re-map the keys of New Tab on Firefox. This is how it would look like.\n\nI am however unsure if this will work for Java applications.\n\nA: In macOS Sierra you can choose between the Dvorak and Dvorak Command (Programmer Dvorak) in System Preferences. So I no longer need Karabiner.\n", "Q: Get a copy of iphone lock screen I no longer have the photo I used for my iPhone lock screen, and I would like to retrieve a copy of it, or a full screen shot of the lock screen without the slider bar and time/date display.  Is there a way I can do this?\n\nA: I wanted to keep a background from an older version of iOS that was no longer available.  I did the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a screenshot of your lock screen by pressing the Lock and Home buttons simultaneously.\n\n*Get the screenshot onto a computer by email or syncing.\n\n*Go to Google Image Search, press the camera icon, and upload the screenshot.\n\n*Find a suitable copy to download.\n\n\nUnfortunately, if it's a photo you took, this won't show any results unless you've also uploaded the photo to the internet at some point.\n", "Q: Use iPod Classic Without iTunes I use a program called iShuffle with my iPod shuffle. All I do is copy music files in Windows Explorer to the Shuffle's Music folder, then run the little app and it magically works without iTunes.\nhttp://agoraphobeus.free.fr/iShuffle/index.html\nIs there an equivalent for the iPod Classic line, and older generations of that line?\n\nA: You could try using Rockbox, however you might want to check whether or not your iPod is supported. Rockbox is an alternative firmware for your iPod classic that allows you to copy music files just like a normal MP3 player.\nhttp://www.rockbox.org/wiki/IpodFAQ\nIt even plays Doom!\n\nA: You can use Foobar2000 which is an amazing music player and manager for Windows.  There are dozens (if not hundreds) of add-ons, one of which adding iPod control.  I personally use this software and it makes managing songs on the iPod very easy. \nThe iPod components has many features and supports album artwork.  It also gives you the option of converting unsupported audio formats (such as FLAC) when you add those to the iPod.  \n", "Q: How do I get a folder to stop forgetting its sorting options? I have a folder (my home folder) which I like to have in icon view and kept arranged by name.\nHowever, every day or so it seems to forget the sorting - although the view options panel seems to think that the option is still valid.   I have to change it to arrange by another criterion and then re-select arrange by name. \nThis is rather irritating, to say the least.  Does anyone know how to fix the Finder's forgetfulness\n \n\nA: \"Arrange by Name\" is a one-time command to arrange the icons. When an item in the folder gets deleted, or new ones added, they don't adhere to this rule, until you force another \"Arrange by Name\". It looks like this is the behavior you are seeing.\nThe solution is to choose \"Sort by Name\", which applies an ongoing rule.\n", "Q: AirPort Extreme and multiple HDD's Hey Guys i think i am not alone who set up his APE for home sharing.\nSo what have i done… I have a Airport extreme (latest version - 5.gen) and 3x powered 2TB HDD's. All are connected over an usb hub (active) which is plugged into the only available USB port. The HDD's contains Backups, iTunes Movies and music. So every time i am at home i am connected and let itunes and my apple tv do the rest. \nHere is my question: Sometimes it seems very slow. Is it possible to boost its performance. Maybe a highend usb hub or something else? Its pretty annoying when the whole APE crashed and i have to restart? \nAny best practices?? How did you solved the problem? \n\nA: Yes, it can be very slow this way, at least compared to other methods. You have a few throttle points: the USB connection, the USB and the wireless connection to your computer & Apple TV. If you stream a movie from your iTunes Library to Apple TV while Time Machine is backing up, you are effectively routing two data streams through the USB hub, and three data streams through your wireless router.\nYour best bet is to get some of the hard drives off of the AirPort Extreme's USB drive. The exact solution can vary greatly based on your exact network and computer setup. A solution could involve moving some external hard drives to plug directly into your Mac or replacing some of the drives with a NAS that can be plugged in via Gigabit Ethernet.\nIf you can post more specifics in your question, I can update this answer to be more specific as well. How many Macs do you have? What types? Which Macs access which drives for which purposes? Etc.\n", "Q: Can I update apps on my ipod when it's full via itunes? My iPod Touch 8gb is pretty full, so I can't install the vital angry birds updates and so forth.\nIs there a way I can upgrade it during sync to iTunes that works round the space without taking all the music off, upgrading apps, then resynching music?\n(and by my iPod I mean my son's)\n\nA: Yes, you can download the apps onto iTunes on your computer. Then, provided you already have app syncing turned on between the iPod and iTunes, you should be able to seamlessly have the updated versions sync over. You can do the same thing to perform iOS updates when the time comes.\nThat said, it can be frustrating in many scenarios if the iPod touch is so full that you can't even download an Angry Birds update. I may recommend finding a way to lose at least a few songs or apps here or there if possible.\n", "Q: Can I get @me.com email address when I only have @icloud.com address?

I would want the two email to point to the same AppleID.\nThe reasons are quire prosaic, @me.com just looks better than @icloud.com.\n\nA: You cannot. Apple has retired the ability to get a new @me.com email address, just like they did for the @mac.com email addresses back in 2008. Existing accounts are grandfathered in, but you are unfortunately out of luck.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of the Events section of Photos on iOS? I have an iPhone 4 and an iPad 3 each running iOS 6.1 (I don't have a Mac). On my iPad I have noticed that in Photos there is a tab labelled Events. This tab doesn't exist on my iPhone. The Events tab is filled with folders named with a date. Sometimes there is more than one folder with the same name.\nI haven't been able to find clear documentation on the use of Events.\nWhat is the purpose of Events in Photos? How do they differ from Albums and how do I use them properly.\n\nA: A new event is created each time you transfer photos from your camera to your iPad, or from your computer to your iPad. Each event is the date when a group of photos was uploaded. As far as I know, unless you have iPhoto, there is no way to change these events names, or configure them at all.\nEvents differ from Albums in that they are created when you upload photos to your iPad. Albums must be created manually.\nEvents work best with iPhoto on OSX as iPhoto is remarkably \"events-centric\". When you import photos into iPhoto on Mac, it will automatically categorize them into \"Events\" (this is where Events can be named and settings can be adjusted). Then, when you sync the iPad with your Mac, these events are loaded onto your iPad.\n", "Q: Would upgrading to SSD solve my performance issues? My MacBook Pro specifications are:\nCore2Duo 2.65 Ghz\n4 GB RAM\n320 GB HD  \nPerformance is killing me literally. Really long response time.  \nDo you suggest to replace the Hard disk with SSD one ? Is it going to solve my MBP performance issues?  \n\nWhat is getting slow\nI'm a software developer (code compiling, building, Xcode, IntelliJ, Sublime Text 2, tens of Chrome tabs, iTunes, Preview).  \nIt could takes seconds to switch between running applications. A lot of spinning colored-balls.\nIt takes seconds to launch an application.\n\nA: A RAM upgrade is inexpensive (~$70) compared to an SSD (~$1 per GB e.g. $250 for a 240GB) and based on your pagefile usage and available RAM I would start there.  That being said, an SSD is a massive performance upgrade and worth every dollar in my opinion.  I won't use a machine without an SSD anymore.\nLinks to: RAM and SSD.\nCould you provide some more details as to what specifically is slow?\n\nA: Note the numbers in the middle of the screenshot.  Your Swap Used is higher than the amount of actual RAM you have, and there is a lot of swap activity.  This indicates you are starved of RAM.  I would upgrade that first.  I have 8GB RAM and my swap used is 33.5MB.\nAn SSD would help here also, somewhat, but swapping that much on an SSD would serve to wear it out faster.\n\nA: In my experience (rMBP 8GB RAM), the SSD is fast enough that swap feels almost as fast as RAM. Even at 8GB RAM, my swap is often 5–10 GBs but everything is responsive because the SSD as fast enough to keep up. \nAs WMD says, it will wear out the SSD though. \n", "Q: Will OTA (Over-the-Air) updates download when tethered? I have a wifi-only iPad, and I understood (or, have heard) it will automatically download iOS system updates when connected to wifi. \nWill iOS automatically download an OTA (Over-the-Air) update when it is tethered to an iPhone (via iPhone wifi or bluetooth)?\n\nA: Yes, you can download the update while tethered to the iPhone via WiFi.  But to clarify, it won't ever automatically download the update without user intervention.\nThis article from OSXDaily details some further workarounds to this issue.\n", "Q: Formatted a Bootcamped drive as a dynamic disk, now can't boot to either Mac or Windows I was trying to create an extra partition to get a file from the Windows side of my Macbook Air to the Mac side, and I accidentally made the disk dynamic without realizing it.

This is not about how to use Insert in OS X or through OS X to Windows running in a VM. See here or here for non-Windows Q&A's.\n\nSomehow in my code editor and command line I keep toggling the Insert key, but I'm not sure how.  I can toggle it by clicking on OVR/INS in the status bar, but what is the key combo that I'm magically fat fingering?\n\nA: Apparently, for Windows running natively on Apple hardware fn + return creates an Insert key press.\n\nA: The keycombination fn + i is resulting in the same  as insert does on Windows. \n\nA: I just wanted to point out, that you can map any key or key combination in OSX to any other key or key combination using Karabiner.\nIn my case, I'm using the following configuration to send Insert to Windows through TeamViewer, for example when running NVDA screen reader software (which heavily relies on key combinations using Insert) to test websites for accessibility.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Fn + Ctrl-Left to Insert</name>\n    <identifier>private.fn_ctrl_to_insert</identifier>\n    <autogen>\n      __KeyToKey__KeyCode::CONTROL_L, ModifierFlag::FN,\n      KeyCode::PC_INSERT\n    </autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nThis way, for example, I can send Insert+N (which opens the NVDA menu) by pressing Fn+Ctrl+N in OSX.\n\nA: the answer is Fn + m\nhowever, to make it work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the On-Screen Keyboard (Windows 2012: Windows Key + C to bring up the charms, click Search, type \"keyboard\")\n\n*Click on Options\n\n*Turn on numeric key pad\n\n*Make sure NumLock is turned off (so you can see the Ins key where the 0 would be)\n\n*on the regular keyboard the \"m\" is where the 0 is, therefore Fn + m = Insert\n\n\nA: I'm using Apple Wirelss Keyboard model A1314 on an DELL XPS 13 laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 and for me, Fn+Shift+return key combination offers what shift+insert offers in Windows, which is paste. \n\nA: While running Midnight commander in terminal on MBP (OSX Yosemite) I use ctrl-T for simuating INS\n\nA: I have been able to find no way to do so, with a modern Macbook Pro.

I have a USB external hard drive with AC adapter that works fine with an Ubuntu machine.

Relevant to analyse your problem is the \"format\" information: HDFS, Mac OS Extended, ExFAT, FAT32, ext3, ext4...\nI guess because your harddisk comes from Ubuntu, it must be ext3 or ext4. If that is the case, please read the following answer for further help: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/29914/44080\n\nA: You can determine exactly how OS X is seeing the drive with the diskutil command.\ndiskutil list\n\nThe command above will list all discovered filesystems. Once you see the number the kernel assigned your specific disk (probably disk1 if it's the first drive connected other than the bootable drive, disk0) then you can get more information for each diskX and diskXsY with X and Y being the digits assigned to each whole disk and each partition on the affected physical or logical volumes:\ndiskutil info disk1\ndiskutil info disk1s1\ndiskutil info disk1s2\n\nOnce you have this level of detail, you may discover that the partition scheme or some other aspect of some of the volumes needs adjusting so that it will mount on OS X as well as on Linux. You can see which filesystems your Mac has support for with the command diskutil listFilesystems. Once you've discovered the filesystems in play, you can either add a driver to OS X for your chosen scheme or repartition and reload the data from Ubuntu if you need that partition to mount on OS X as well as Linux.\n", "Q: Backup files from recovery utility My Mac seems to have given up.

I can boot into the recovery utility and launch a terminal, and can ls /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/joe/Documents and see my data, but how can I launch finder (or anything else) to grab these files?\n\nA: There are a few methods to accomplish this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have another Mac accessible, boot the dying Mac into Target Disk Mode. Plug it into the other Mac via Thunderbolt or Firewire. You should see your dying Mac show up as an external hard drive. Drag and drop what is needed.\n\n*Get an external hard drive at least the size of your Mac's internal drive. Plug it in and boot into Recovery Mode. Open Disk Utility. You should see the external drive and boot volume. Use Disk Utility to Restore one volume to the other. This will destroy any existing data on the external hard drive.\n\n*If you can't reformat an external hard drive but have a bit of space available to move the select files you need, you can boot into Recovery Mode and use Terminal to move the files over that you need. Use the cp UNIX command to do this. For example, to move all of your Documents to an external hard drive named \"External\" you would use the following command:  \ncp -r \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/joe/Documents/\" \"/Volumes/External/\"\n\nA: if using the cp -r \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/joe/Documents/\" \"/Volumes/External\" make sure to have the last slash at the end or it may have trouble finding the drive. it should be\ncp -r \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/joe/Documents/\" \"/Volumes/External/\"\n\nalso make sure your drive is actually named \"External\" as it is in the example above.\n", "Q: Apple wireless keyboard is outputting an \" character when I expect an @ character I just bought a Mac Mini and a wireless apple keyboard.

Just ask brew itself with brew --cache.\nThis lets you do the following in bash:\nmv wget-1.14.tar.gz $(brew --cache)\n\nalternately, in fish:\nmv wget-1.14.tar.gz (brew --cache)\n\nAfter which running brew install wget should result in brew announcing that it's downloading the archive, followed immediately by its realization that the archive is \"Already downloaded\", and everything proceeding smoothly from there.\n\nA: According to this:\n\nNot really without modifying the formula file. \n\nif your local archive is pre-build file, aka 'bottle' in Brew.\nHere is what I dig out:\nThe brew bottle is MacOS version-related.\nTake pkg-config for example.\nhere on https://bintray.com/homebrew/bottles/pkg-config#files/, it lists different files for different MacOS version.\nAfter downloading the correct file, you need to move it to correct path which can be generated by\nbrew --cache --force-bottle pkg-config\nfor 10.14: it's like:\n\n/Users/username/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/dd6c78ec64b7c09961ccdb1bf873b5852fd93783cf25ae9b9399c5896a420462--pkg-config-0.29.2.mojave.bottle.tar.gz\n\nfor 10.13: it's like:\n\n/Users/username/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/8b865a8ad8179d4a45289cab9267cc5e3a6153d06432d90cf1745caf5d92a64d--pkg-config-0.29.2.high_sierra.bottle.tar.gz\n\nafter that, brew can find the cached local file when you run brew install pkg-config. otherwise, it will still download from a URL.\n\njust move file to $(brew --cache) won't work anymore, at least for today's brew( 2.19 version in my case).\n\nA: If Homebrew already has a formula for it (in /usr/local/Library/Formula), and you have the exact archive that the formula expects (i.e. same file name and same contents, as determined by SHA1 or whatever hash type the formula uses), you can put the archive in ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew and then try brew install formula_name (substituting the correct name for formula_name, of course).\n\nA: It is possible to pre-download a file for a formula but you will need correct cache file name which can be generated using brew --cache -s <formula>. \nFor example, for Erlang formula, brew --cache -s erlang will print the correct name of the cached download. This means instead of manually renaming a formula, you can run:\nwget source-version.tar.gz\nmv source-version.tar.gz $(brew --cache -s <formula>)\n\n\nA: $ brew install -f wget-1.14.tar.gz\n\n\nA: Brew updated its caching strategy, you need put the downloaded file into ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads, and follow its naming convention.\nYou can let brew start the download, then you will see a .incomplete file, e.g. 544b4d734091aeb6482dbe2496a8ff223d15bc970fa330d3dccbb0bb6fb0e13e--qemu-4.2.0.catalina.bottle.tar.gz.incomplete, then you can rename your file into 544b4d734091aeb6482dbe2496a8ff223d15bc970fa330d3dccbb0bb6fb0e13e--qemu-4.2.0.catalina.bottle.tar.gz.\n\nA: According to https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/21346\nbut now the source location is changed, you can search download_strategy.rb in your computer\nmy location is \"/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew\"\n\nand then lock the rb source file (or it will use git tool to restore itself)\nwhen try to use \"brew install xxx\" in terminal, you will get the whole file cache path location:\n\n\nA: Put your brew tarballs in some directory, then set that directory to be your cache directory using the HOMEBREW_CACHE environment variable or specify it with the --cache argument\n\n--cache [options] [formula]\nDisplay Homebrew’s download cache.

A person within my network got access to my MacBook Pro through Wi-fi, and somehow now he can connect remotely. I cannot change the Wi-fi password because we both pay for it.  So, my only choice so far is to avoid not to use Wi-Fi at all, until I learn on what to do to remove his fingers of my machine.\nI did 3 factory reset, cleaned up all my files but as soon I am within his range he is again messing with my files. I tripled check all my security settings such as firewall, disabled infrared receiver, created a vault, even I now use a firmware password to log into my machine. \nHow to stop his remote connection? \n\nA: Disable (uncheck) in System Preferences+Sharing: \nFile Sharing, \nScreen Sharing, \nRemote Management, \nRemote Login + (check in allow access for ?) who has the permission.\nalso check if there is a user profile set up that is not yours.\n\nA: I recommend that you get a littlesnitch. littlesnitch will track your Web traffic and tell you which applications are sending data from your computer.

Press the power button and it'll restart and restoring the windows.\nPress the power button for so long and it'll sleep. When return it'll restore the whole windows.\nWhat about if I want true restart or shut down?\n\nA: Press and hold the power button for several seconds and your Mac will power completely off. This should only be required in the most extreme circumstances. Normally, you should shut down your Mac by clicking on  the Apple icon in the upper left corner of the menu bar and selecting Shut Down... from the drop down menu.\nYour applications are resuming when you log back in because you're telling OS X to restore their state when you shut down.\nWhen you shut down or log out make sure the Reopen windows when logging back in option in the shut down window is UNCHECKED. Like this:\nThis will prevent OS X from saving the state of open applications and restoring them when you log back in.\nYou should also check your log in settings to make certain you aren't starting programs as login options. Open System Preferences and click on the 'Users & Groups' icon. Find your name in the user list and click on it and then click the Login Items tab. Remove any applications you don't want to start on login from this list by selecting the application and clicking the - button at the bottom of the table. Like this:\n\nA: First thing first, pressing the power down until it shuts off is NOT recommended unless in extreme cases as forcing the hardware to cut power may result in a corrupted disk image if there are system (or user) processes writing data out to the SSD or HDD.

I have a HP laserjet printer installed in my office. The printer is connected to my office LAN and I connected my iPhone to the WiFi router to access internet and that WiFi modem is connected directly to the office LAN. Now I want to take printouts from my phone directly to the HP Laserjet printer. How it's possible? Do I need to download any software or extra apps to take direct print from this so called Apple Smartphone?\n\nA: You don't need software on the iOS device, but you do need a device like the Lantronix xPrintServer to smarten up old printers that don't speak the new AirPrint language.\nMost new printers speak AirPrint out of the box, but older printers need help learning new tricks.\n\nA: Yes, the new HP LaserJet printers are mostly AirPrint enabled. Apple publish a list of supported AirPrint printers.\nI can recommend Apple App Store wise, PrintCentral, or Print n Share; both of which I have installed on my iPad and iPhone.\n", "Q: Microsoft Outlook 2011 memory leak Can anyone tell me why Outlook is using between 650Mb and 1.2Gb of memory?\nI've googled but can't find anything. Outlook isn't crashing (Seems to be the main problem others are having) but my whole system is hanging.\nIf it was up to me I'd uninstall, but this is a work machine.\nAny advice would be appreciated. \n\nA: It's most likely due to your particular database file.\nHave you tried making a new user account and checking Outlook with an empty local mail store? You could also go in and switch user's but I don't recall the steps needed to close the main outlook database and make a new one so I'll leave that for someone else to edit in or answer.\n", "Q: Unable to adjust partition of USB drive with Mountain Lion Disk Utility I have a 500 GB USB drive, which I once partitioned into two parts: one encrypted—Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted), and the other not—Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nNow I want to change the partition layout, and probably add a new partition. However, I was unable to do this in Disk Utility: all options related to partitions are greyed out. See the screen cap for example (clicking on the partitions does not work, either).\n\nThis is pretty weird: not only can't I resize or add partition, I can't make any change to the partition layout, including completely reformatting the disk! Any ideas about this?\n\nA: You cannot resize a drive that has been encrypted. You will first need to unencrypt the drive, then resize the partitions, then re-encrypt the drive.\n", "Q: How do you show only complete albums in iTunes 11? iTunes 11 seems to revolve around the screen that shows you all of the different albums that you own.  However, the vast majority of the albums iTunes is showing me are albums from which I own only one song, and it is making it difficult to find those albums that are actually complete.\nIn iTunes 11, how do you filter the albums displayed in the Albums pane?\n\nA: Make a smart playlist with the following filter - Comments contains Full Album. \nFor each album I want to add, I click on Get Info and add Full Album to the comments field\n\nA: You can't. Write a suggestion to Apple at: \nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html\n\nA: You can create a playlist that contains all full albums in your library using AppleScript. The code below is just a small modification to the script linked in Kirk's answer so that it creates one playlist instead of one per album. It's slow (takes maybe 5 minutes to run through my library) and is very sensitive to any metadata inaccuracies, but it works for me.\n-- Creates one playlist of all full albums you have in iTunes\n-- Set the playlistPrefix and playlistSuffix as desired before running\n\n-- Original script by duozmo on Ask Different\n-- http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130201061128257\n-- http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/77626\n\n-- Based on code by Brad Campbell\n-- http://www.bradcampbell.com/2009/05/26/make-a-whole-album-playlist-in-itunes/\n\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set albumPlaylistName to \"Full Albums\"\n    -- Create playlist\n    if user playlist albumPlaylistName exists then\n        try\n            delete tracks of user playlist albumPlaylistName\n        end try\n    else\n        make new user playlist with properties {name:albumPlaylistName}\n    end if\n\n    set albumBuckets to {} as list\n    set allSongs to (every track of library playlist 1 whose enabled is true and podcast is false and kind contains \"audio\") as list\n\n    -- Find all partial albums in iTunes\n    repeat with currentTrack in allSongs\n        set albumName to album of currentTrack as text\n        set artistName to artist of currentTrack as text\n\n        -- First check for missing values, then perform integer comparison\n        -- Zero is on the left to force interger type coercion, just in case\n        if album of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than length of albumName then\n            if artist of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than length of artistName then\n                if track number of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than track number of currentTrack then\n                    if track count of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than track count of currentTrack then\n                        if albumBuckets does not contain album of currentTrack then\n                            copy album of currentTrack to the end of albumBuckets\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end if\n        end if\n\n    end repeat\n\n    repeat with currentAlbum in albumBuckets\n        set albumSongs to (every track of library playlist 1 whose album is currentAlbum)\n        set firstTrack to first item of albumSongs\n\n        -- Filter album list to act only on full albums\n        if (count of albumSongs) is equal to track count of first item of albumSongs and 1 is less than (count of albumSongs) then\n            -- This is a full album, construct the playlist\n\n            -- Sort tracks by track number\n            set albumSongsSorted to {} as list\n            repeat with i from 1 to (count of albumSongs)\n                repeat with trk in albumSongs\n                    if track number of trk is i then\n                        set nextSong to trk\n                        copy nextSong to the end of albumSongsSorted\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n            end repeat\n\n            try\n                repeat with trk in albumSongsSorted\n                    duplicate trk to user playlist albumPlaylistName\n                end repeat\n            end try\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    display dialog albumPlaylistName & \" playlist created!\"\nend tell\n\nAnother option would be to use Doug's Random Full Albums script if you just want iTunes to act like a CD changer on album shuffle mode.\n\nA: There's no way to do that, alas. This hint shows an AppleScript that can make playlists from all complete albums, but if you have a lot of albums, it might be overwhelming.\n\nA: My workaround is a bit different, because I didn't want to write a script and wasn't sure how long Apple would continue to support AppleScript anyway.\nInstead what I do is either:\n\n*\n\n*tag the fact it's an incomplete album in the metadata, by adding \"incomplete_album\" in the comments field for the relevant tracks, and then editing the smart playlist settings to exclude tracks which have that.\n\n*remove the track number from single tracks, and then write a rule in the smart playlist to exclude tracks where the track number is blank.\n\nMethod 2 is arguably slightly cleaner, though the advantage of the first is that should you ever want to look at your list of partial albums (e.g. to decide which of them you might want to get obtain in full) you can write make a smart playlist that works the other way around and lists only \"incomplete_album\".\nAlso, I think a good rule is to never remove metadata except where you know it's inaccurate, better to add additional tags so you can do what you want with them.\n", "Q: iOS Simulator Mobile Safari I might possibly have a html5 game project coming up, that would need to run on iOS devices. However i dont own many of them, nor do i have the money to buy them. My friend did remind me i might be able to simulate on the iOS simulator, but im not so sure. My mac is currently experiencing some problems so i cannot check it for myself. But it would help if someone could answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the iOS simulator have safari browser on it? If so, how accurate\n\n*would you say it is at displaying html5 games?\n\n\nA: The iOS simulator does have a Safari browser. Though the Safari browser found on the iOS and OS X are both based on WebKit, they are not exactly identical. So the Safari browser on the iOS is an approximation, not an accurate. \nIn addition, the WebKit on OS X is optimized to take advantage of the hardware in current Mac which at present performs faster than the slower hardware in current iOS devices.\nI'd suggest that while it's possible to develop using the iOS simulator, it's best to test (for performance and reliability/crash) on the actual iOS device.\n", "Q: iTunes - don't know how to moves songs from library to library in same computer I am using iTunes for the first time, and it seems to be very different from Windows OS.\nI am trying to do what I would have expected would be a very basic thing - take a song from one library in iTunes and move the song to a different library in iTunes. Everything is on the same computer! I could not find a drag and drop option or a cut and paste option. \n\nA: Here's what I do. I drag the items from iTunes to a folder, such as one on the Desktop. When you drag items from iTunes, their actual files will copy to a folder or window. I then quit iTunes, launch it again, choose the other library, and drag that folder onto the iTunes window, or to an empty playlist. \n", "Q: Remove _specific_ items from Finder Open With menu Is there any way to purge specific applications from the Finder's \"Open With\" menu? Mine is cluttered with all sorts of applications I'd never choose to open HTML files with (Word, Calibre, all sorts of undesirables; see image). I know there're various tricks to remove duplicates or uninstalled applications, but I'd just like to prune.\nFailing that, is there a way to move an app higher in the list (I'd like Sublime Text 2 higher up the list), or simply to bypass the menu and open the file in the two applications I'm actually interested in opening it with (Sublime and Chrome, essentially).\nRunning 10.7 Lion, if applicable. \n\nA: You can for example open /Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Info.plist and remove entries from the CFBundleDocumentTypes array. To apply the changes, run sudo touch /Applications/calibre.app/ or /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -f /Applications/calibre.app/ and relaunch Finder.\nIf the application is signed, it invalidates the code signature. And since 10.8 some applications like TextEdit and Chess have crashed on launch if the Info.plist has been modified.\n\nA: This might do the trick. Under ~/Library/Preferences you'll find a file called com.apple.LaunchServices.plist. This file lists the preferred applications to open with for the different formats.\nOpening the file with an editor such as TextMate should let you edit the associations.\n\nA: Never say never. You can do that (albeit manually from the command line) with\na CLI called lsregister - /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister. It can be used to either register launchers or unregister there. -dump will show you all the present associations, and -unregister can be used to selectively remove.\n\nA: You can't do that. It used to be possible, using something like Open-With Manager, but changes in 10.7 prevented this from working. I've not seen any other hacks to do this since.\n\nA: RCDefaultApp can do it and it has a nice GUI.  See this blog post for a quick explanation of how to use RCDefaultApp \n", "Q: RAID system with external hardrives I have a few external ssd hardrives (My Passport, in my case). I would like to integrate them within a system that provides reliability in case of failure, by producing redundant information across the devices, seamlessly from the User point of view.  \nWhat would be a product worth considering? \n\nA: First let's clarify one thing: RAID is not the same as backup. Building a RAID array out of several (presumably USB) external drives would have many drawbacks. See this question I asked a while back for the explanation. I suspect what you really want is passive and seamless disk/data backup in which case OS X's built-in Time Machine works great. And if you have Mountain Lion it is capable of using all of your external drives to store the backups.\n", "Q: Can I enable hiding the dock on my MacBook monitor only? When at home I use my 13\" MacBook Pro hooked up to an 27\" external monitor. When working on my 27\" screen I prefer to have a visible dock at all times. I have enough screen real estate to afford this luxury.\nWhen I'm on the road working on my 13\" screen I prefer to automatically hide the dock as it really gets in the way when screen real estate is limited.\nI now manually switch between enabling and disabling hiding (using ⌥⌘D) but I would prefer this to happen automatically. Can I enable hiding the dock on my MacBook monitor and disable hiding the dock on my external monitor?\n\nA: I was able to use the previously suggested ControlPlane app along with some simple shell scripts to get this working.\nFirst, I created a context for having my Thunderbolt Display plugged in (\"Desk\"), and one that negated that choice (\"Lap\"). Next, I made two simple shell scripts to toggle the autohide setting and restart the Dock. I put them in a .controlplane directory in my home folder.\n~/.controlplane/dock-hiding-on.sh\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true && killall Dock\n~/.controlplane/dock-hiding-off.sh\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool false && killall Dock\nI then set those files to be executable. \nLastly, I set the correct script to run for the appropriate ControlPlane context. (Note: I had to show hidden files in the dialog with \"⌘+⇧+.\")\n\nA: Applications like Sidekick or ControlPlane allow you to change settings (network, desktop picture, custom terminal actions) based on location evidences (geolocation, attached devices...etc).\nI'm sure you will be able to use one of those to detect you are at your desk with your 27\" plugged in and run a command disabling auto-hide.\n", "Q: Why Mac Disk Utility Run so fast? I run mac disk utility. It finish saying my disk is fine.\nC'mon. Windows chkdsk takes a while.\nWhy it's so fast? Does it actually check stuffs chkdsk check?\nAnd what should I do if I want chkdsk kind of check (longer but more thorough)\n\nA: The OS X disk utility checks the HFS+ volume header, and its backup header (located in the last block of the disk). If both match, then the rest of the disk is assumed to be consistent. That's along the lines of quick fsck(8) check. Another quick check for journal consistency is performed if you've set up journaling, and if that also checks ok, then the rest is skipped.\nYou can always run fsck manually, or - http://www.newosxbook.com/ has a tool called HFSleuth which - while directed at programmer/hacker types - can allow you to do a more thorough check.\n\nA: Did you run the repair on the disk (the top entry in Disk Utility's sidebar) or volume (the indented entry under the disk)? They check (& repair) different things:\nChecking a disk checks the partition map and hidden partitions (like the EFI partition). It does not check the volume data structures (except for encrypted volumes -- for them it does the volume check as well). This normally takes a few seconds.\nChecking a volume checks the data structures that keep track of individual files within the volume. On a volume with a large number of files (e.g. an OS X system volume), this can take several minutes.\nGenerally, when verifying/repairing a disk's integrity, I recommend doing both of these operations. Do the disk first, and if that gets a clean bill of health proceed to checking the volume(s) in it.\n", "Q: iPhone possible hacking My young daughter tried to contact her friend via iMessage. Her friend's account is set up via her father's email address. My daughter later received unsavoury texts back. She deleted these straight away as there were swear words and she felt guilty about them.\nOne message remained on the iPod. It came from the father's email address, he claims that there must be a crossed line or his iPhone has been hacked. \nIs either of this possible? \n\nA: Iphone, was not hacked. wasn't crossed. Husband was arrested and admitted to charges.\nThanks for help, it confirmed that the device was probably not compromised.\n\nA: If the father has plugged his Apple ID into any other iOS devices during their initial setup, those devices by default are provisioned to use that Apple ID for iMessage. With that in mind, it is quite possible that a sibling or even other friend or family member of the father has his account installed.\nIf the father insists he is not sending the messages, he needs to reset his Apple ID password immediately. This will ensure that whatever unsavory character he lent his Apple ID to is no longer sending your daughter inappropriate messages, and is frankly the only responsible thing for him to do.\n", "Q: Encrypting sensitive data on Mac + Windows I've been a long-time Windows user, using a utility called AxCrypt to encrypt sensitive documents which holded sensitive info (bank passwords, credit card numbers, etc).\nI had an encrypted Excel spreadsheet, which was placed on a shared dropbox folder, where everyone who had the password could easily view the file, and if needed change the data and save (AxCrypt will automatically encrypt the file, which is saved to dropbox and synced to all users).\nIt worked perfectly for years, and then 2 of us switched to Mac.\nAxCrypt port to Mac doesn't allow the simple opening of encrypted file, changing it, and having it automatically encrypted.\nSo we either use Windows emulation on Mac, or find another solution that has a good experience (easily view encrypted files, easily change and re-encrypt, save to dropbox).\nAnyone know on a solution that can help? I tried TrueCrypt, but it seems to be more cumbersome than the existing AxCrypt solution.\n\nA: Consider using Wuala instead of Dropbox. It's the same service as Dropbox but has integrated encryption. Then you don't have to worry about encrypting before upload and decrypting after download anymore.\nDisadvantages of Wuala are (in my opinion): a worse user experience, and user interface (which may be due to the fact that there are less interface designers and more encryption engineers at Wuala); and a higher memory usage (which is due to the fact that Wuala is Java based, and the encryption algorithms come at a price).\n\nA: Here is a dmg or sparsbundle solution which will allow you to create the required container file for the files you want to encrypt:\nhttp://kelleycomputing.net/freedmg/\nThis file can then be placed in dropbox and mounted by macs.  If you then need to mount the file on windows you will need to convert it to an iso as per:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/321159/how-to-mount-a-dmg-file-in-windows\nThen everyone, mac and windows should be able to open the file.\n\nA: Here's the solution that I chose eventually:\nI'm using KeePassX as password manager: its database is on a dropbox shared folder. Since KeePass has a Mac OS X client, a Windows client and an iOS client for my iphone - it is exactly what I neeeded. (again, data file on iphone is replicated via iOS dropbox client).\nWorks for me, fantastically.\n", "Q: Will 27' 2560x1440 Korean IPS monitor (brand: Crossover) with DVI-D output work with MBP retina? I have a 15' MBP retina (which has HDMI and Thunderbolt interfaces for connecting to external displays).\nI was planning to buy this 27' Crossover monitor (one of those Korean displays that have popular lately). I was planning to use it through a DVI-D to HDMI connector like the ones found here and here.\nHowever, the monitor seller's listing on the page says:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not use with port convertor\n\n*No AD board internal GPU, APU, Laptop, Macbook are not compatible (sic).\nI have read that HDMI and DVI video signals are identical and they only differ in the physical connectors. \nIf so, can I assume that my planned setup will indeed work with my MBP retina? If not, is there a workaround?\n\nA: The problem with the high resolution is that the monitor uses a dual-link DVI-cable as it is needed to provide such a high resolution. The Dual-link cable is not a normal DVI-cable and therefore will not work as expected with a normal adapter. The adapter you have linked should suffice thou. But beware that the ad says no adapters and no Macbook, this could be a warning towards people trying to hook up a \"HDMI to single-link DVI\"/similar or to owners of an old Macbook. We can't know that from the information given from the ad and you should consider contacting the seller. \nIt can work(you can even say it should work), but looking at this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4036890?start=0&tstart=0\nit's not guaranteed that it'll work.\n\nA: The critical specification in that linked listing is the \"Dual Link\" portion of the connector and not the DVI-D shape of the connector (although that of course is also needed on the Mac end of things).\nYou will need a special mini Displayport to Dual Link DVI adapter from Apple (or another vendor) to connect any new Thunderbolt or mini Displayport equipped Mac to that monitor.\nSo, if you consider a $99 adapter not part of the MacBook Pro, the answer would be no - you can't drive that monitor, but the ad does say MacBook isn't compatible and since Apple discontinued the MacBook you might not even care that some MacBook don't have mini DisplayPort (mini DP).\nApple has a good, no questions asked (14 day) return policy and this eBay auction includes buyer protection, so I would say you'd be covered in the outside chance there is actually some other problem using that display with a dual link compatible adapter and a MacBook or MacBook Air or MacBook Pro with mini DP. All the newer Thunderbolt Macs will also work with this Apple adapter (at least as of March 2013).\nThose cheap adapters probably won't work due to the dual link nature of the signal needed for a display that's larger than a normal (a.k.a Single-Link) DVI as opposed to Dual-Link DVI. You could try them if you didn't mind wasting time on returning a cheap adapter or losing that money and eating the adapter purchase. I'd be quite confident Apple's adapter would provide full Dual-Link DVI and if it didn't I'd be prepared to ask for a refund from eBay and Apple on the adapters. Unless you can't test things within 14 days of receipt, you should be covered if it works and if it doesn't work.\nIt should work with the right adapter, though.\n\nA: If you are worried about compatibility, and ordering from eBay with international shipping, then why not cut out the fear and by the same monitor from your local Monoprice (or at least get one shipped from the US), who have recently begun rebranding these items, and shipping them with a decent dead pixel warranty for $390.60:\nhttp://www.monoprice.com/home/news_detail.asp?news_id=238&s_keyword=\nhttp://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=113&cp_id=11307&cs_id=1130703&p_id=9579&seq=1&format=2\n\n\nIf you're a serious gamer or professional graphic artist, you need a seriously good monitor and you won't find much better than this 27\" IPS LED CrystalPro Monitor from Monoprice!\nThe heart of this monitor is the beautiful IPS (In-Plane Switching) LED panel made by LG in Korea. This is the same panel that is used in the 27\" Apple Cinema Displays, which are famous for their stunning color reproduction and ultra-wide viewing angle. The IPS technology in this monitor helps produce this color and viewing angle, as well as increasing response time to 6 milliseconds, which is a critical factor for gaming.\nThis monitor is designed for the high end. It only supports Dual Link Digital DVI-D input, but it produces a tight 2560x1440 resolution. The IPS technology helps produce a 178° viewing angle in both the horizonal and vertical planes, which makes this an ideal monitor for an Eyefinity setup.\nThis monitor measures about 25.5\" x 16\" x 2.3\" and weighs only about 14.3 lbs. It draws 65 watts of power during operation and only 1 watt in standby. The included stand raises the monitor off the desk and allows it to be tilted.\nThe monitor uses an external AC adapter, which keeps the internal electronics away from the heat of an AC power conversion process. The AC adapter can be used with any AC power source from 90 ~ 265 VAC at 50/60 Hz, making it appropriate for use in both US and non-US markets. It has a 100x100 VESA mounting pattern and can therefore be attached to almost any wall or desk mount.\nAs you've come to expect from Monoprice, we stand behind our products and offer a full 1 year warranty, which is at least 3-4 times what is offered by other monitor manufacturers. Additionally, we are so confident of the quality of these displays that we are guaranteeing these monitor will have less than 5 dead pixels. If you can count 5 dead pixels anywhere on the screen, we'll give you a new one. By comparison, the industry standard, even for industry leaders like Apple and LG, is 10 dead pixels or even more.\n\nCheck the customer reviews section to see people claiming to have hooked it up to MBPs etc, and even suggesting which adapter you need - you can get these from Monoprice at the same time, without paying $99 too.\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but I stumbled on it and thought I would put in my two cents.\nI own 4 Yamakasi 301 Sparta monitors. Very similar to the one in the question. They are 30\" 2560x1600 displays. They do not have an ad board. I use them for my home office. I have a GTX 770 and a GTX 750 driving the video signal. I have only been able to get them to work using Dual Link DVI. I have tried all manner of converter to try and connect them via display port and via hdmi and have never been successful. \nEDIT\nI bought a active mini display port to dual link DVI adapter from mono price for I think $60? That works with these monitors. I also bought a mini display port to full displayport adapter to use them with another dock I have. That also works. So that's the answer. Active display port adapter from mono price. I should also mention I tried a different active display port adapter that was also dual link dvi, and it did not work. It was a friends and I don't remember the brand, but the mono price adapter works and is the cheapest option.\nEND EDIT\nI also have a 13\" macbook pro with the 2560x1600 display. It has 2x mini display port and HDMI. I have also tried to connect the monitors to my macbook pro and have never been succesful. I did on one occasion get the macbook pro to actually recognize the monitor, but was only able to get the resolution up to 1280x800. \nPersonally, I would recommend not getting monitors with no ad board unless you are going to have them connected to a desktop with a dedicated video card 100% of the time. And it's better if you keep your computer running most of the time. They have caused some headaches. Every now and then I have to unplug the video and power cables, disable and re enable my video cards, and then plug them back in to get my computer to recognize them. This happens after driver updates or sometimes when my computer restarts. It's not a huge deal because it doesn't happen often, but it's still a pain having to crawl under my desk and try and disconnect the cables. I bought them to save money, but in retrospect, I wish I would have just bought monitors that had an ad board that were more flexible.\nAnother thing to note, which may or may not apply to all monitors with no ad board, but may be worth noting. I have burned through 3 power supplies. Not sure if this is just the particular model I have, but the power supplies that came with  the monitors are I believe 140 watts? They get very hot, and 3 times now have gotten so hot that components in the power supply actually came soldered from the board and fried the power supply. In one case dripping  capacitor fluid all over my carpet. This has happened over the course of 2 years, and the replacement power supplies aren't very expensive, but they haven't always been easy to find. The ad board free monitors all seem to be fairly cheap from what I've seen,  which is fine because that's the reason I purchased them in  the first place, but it's important to know what you're getting yourself into.\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: What is com.apple.mail.plist and why was it slowing Mail down? I fixed an annoying problem with Mail 6.2 (I'm on ML 1.8.2), where Mail was slow and a pain to use.  I am on a SSD so everything was jerky while typing, sending mail out, and it would take ~1 second to display the text of a message when I scrolled up/down the list.  On a HDD I presume the problem would have been much more bothersome.\nI looked at Mail slow under ML/ Apple forum and someone mentioned to look in console for errors such as deny file-read-data /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist, and to delete such plist in case.  I did have such message, so I went on to delete the file (and a file of the same name in ~/Library/Preferences/).  Now Mail works fine, no slowness, no jerkiness.  So the question is, what the hell is com.apple.mail.plist, what was doing in my laptop and why Mail seems to be much happier without it.\nFYI my laptop had a install from scratch of ML + backup restored through Time Machine.  In addition I restarted Mail after deleting com.apple.mail.plist and all my personal defaults (font, how to display messages, etc) are all still there.\n\nA: com.apple.mail.plist is a property list that stores your defaults (preferences) for the Mail application.\nDeleting the file meant that Mail.app would on next launch use the factory defaults.\nWhy your instance of Mail was misbehaving, I can't tell you, but deleting the prefs sometimes helps in these cases.\n", "Q: Delete music directly from iphone I would like to find a way to delete individual songs from my iPhone and automatically synchronize this deletion in iTunes.\nMy current workaround is this: Star the songs I don't like anymore with 1 star, synchronize iPhone (takes forever), then delete the songs with 1 star and resync.\nAny better way to do this?\n\nA: You can delete songs directly in your music application. Just get the title overview and swipe from one side to the other and a delete button appears.\nWhen you have automatic syncronisation activated in your iTunes, it will automatically sync your music next time you're in the same network with your iTunes computer, your iTunes is started on this computer and your iPhone is locked and wired to the power.\n", "Q: Close all applications in Mountain Lion Is there any hotkey, AppleScript or separate application for that?\nI don't really like kill 20 applications manually every time I make reboot.\n\nA: The Finder should safely quit any open apps whenever you logout or reboot. If there is a document with unsaved changes It will prompt you to save or discard the changes before quitting. The keyboard shortcut is Command-Option-Shift-Q.\nIf you do not want all the apps restarting when you log back in, uncheck the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" checkbox in the logout dialog.\n\nA: You can often just hold ⌘Q, or uncheck \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" in the ⇧⌘Q dialog. Anyway, here is a shell script that quits applications shown in the Dock in parallel:\nIFS=$'\\n'\nfor a in $(osascript -e 'set text item delimiters to linefeed\ntell app \"System Events\" to name of processes where background only is false\nresult as text'); do osascript -e 'on run {x}\nquit app x\nend' -- \"$a\" &\ndone\n\nYou can assign it a shortcut with an application like Alfred or FastScripts.\n", "Q: Change the default Dock stack content display style I love the Dock stacks. But I always use the list view option. I don't really fancy the default \"Automatic\" option. Do you know if it is possible (maybe using the defaults command?) to set the default way to display the content of a Dock stack?\nThanks in advance for your help! :-) \n\nA: This would change the style of all stacks to list, but you have to relaunch Dock to apply the changes:\nfor n in {0..19}; do /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set persistent-others:$n:tile-data:showas 3\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Dock.plist; done 2> /dev/null\nYou could run it every 8 hours by running EDITOR=nano crontab -e and adding a line like 0 */8 * * * for n in ....\n\nA: I haven't seen a option like this. But you can always right click on your stack and select a fixed way to show that specific stack.\nAlthough, maybe you can find this option using this: Secrets. This is a app that gives you a lot of hidden options.\n", "Q: iPad Mini won't turn on I have an iPad Mini that I have had sense the fall.  This morning I woke up and it was working fine.  Now it won't turn on.  I've tried all the regular fixes and nothing is working.  Will the manufacturer warranty cover this?  Should I take it to an Apple store?\n\nA: Could the battery be dead? If so it may take 5 to 10 minutes hooked up to a wall charger before it will have enough power to reboot. Make sure you use the provided wall charger as most USB chargers don't have enough power and take a very long time to recharge iPads.\n\nA: It would be nice if you could expand on 'regular fixes'. There are multiple reasons why your ipad would not turn on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold both home & lock buttons for 5 seconds, this will force reboot an ios devise and can bring it back to life.\n\n*Dead battery, leave it charging for 15 minutes. Even standard ipad chargers take a little time to bring it back to life.\n\n*If none of the above worked it would be a good idea to take it to an apple store and see if they can do anything about it. If the ipad is not old as yours all costs should be covered by a warranty.\n\n\nFrom personal experience I can say that once I left mine in car on a hot day where it baked to death. So I had to replace a charging part. If those 'regular fixes' won't work book an appointment and head to an apple store where you will get professional help.\n", "Q: Accidentally locked out of Mac I removed the staff group and closed my finder window (yes I am a fool for doing this).

I moved my old library into the location on Advanced settings.\nWhy doesn't it display my music???\nEDIT:\nOSX 1.7.5\niTunes 11.0.2\nIt is on my local machine.\n\nA: Just moving your music folder to iTunes library directory won't update your library. You need to add to you Library manually by clicking on File > Add to Library... and selecting your folder (the one you just moved).\nHope I could help.\n\nA: So you music files are in your iTunes library's directory? If so then they need to be explicitly added to iTunes. My favorite tool for doing this is Music Folder Files Not Added \n\nA: You also need to copy the iTunes Library file from ~/Music/iTunes to the new location. That's how iTunes knows what's in the library; it then looks in the location where the music files are to play them.\n", "Q: Retrieve Previous Computer Serial Number From Old Ext Hard Drive This is a long shot, but I thought I'd ask anyways. I used to have an iMac 24\" and the internal hard drive went bad on it. So I bought an external hard drive, installed OS 10.7 on it and booted the computer from that hard drive. I gave it to my friend and he used it for a while with his own external hard drive and I kept mine. It was stolen the other day and he didn't record the serial number. Is there some way I can pull from some file the serial number from the external hard drive that I have in hopes to at least file a police report?\n\nA: The serial number is read directly from the machine's logic board, so it won't by default be located in any file on the computer.\nDid you purchase this computer from an Apple Retail Store? They keep receipts going back many many years in their retail systems and will happily pull a receipt for you if you can prove identity.\nLikewise, if you registered the system with Apple upon purchasing (from anywhere) and can call AppleCare, they should be able to provide you with the serial number for your police report.

I've searched and and figured out how to log cron output by editing the plist file, but nothing specifically about how to integrate into the Notifications app.\n\nA: You need to use a third party piece of software to send messages to the Notification Center from command line tools and scripts.\nterminal-notifier appears to be a popular solution.

I also have DNS set up so that if I go to example.com then it will send the request to my static public IP which will in turn cause the Time Capsule to forward the request on port 80 to my Mac Mini.\nHowever I now have a Raspberry Pi on the local network also, with the ip address of 192.168.1.5. I want to be able to access the web server on the Raspberry Pi by going to pi.example.com, but I'm not sure how I can get the Time Capsule to port forward based on the domain. What I'd like to be able to have is something that works like this:\nexample.com:80       -->   public IP   -->    192.168.1.8:80\npi.example.com:80    -->   public IP   -->    192.168.1.5:80\n\n\nNB: Posted this on apple.stackexchange.com as it relates to the Time Capsule, however it may be better suited on ServerFault, if so I ask if the moderators could kindly move it there.\n\nA: The Time Capsule cannot port forward based on incoming domain request. It is not aware of the domain requested, only the port you are attempting to access. You need software, like properly-configured Apache, to handle multiple virtual domains within a network. I am not knowledgeable enough of the topic to advise you specifics, but it would involve handing off DNS and/or routing duties to a server (such as the Pi or OS X Server) and putting the Time Capsule in bridge mode.\nA better way to do this is to hit the Raspberry Pi at another public port, such as example.com:81. The Time Capsule can handle this with ease.\n", "Q: Is there any terminal tool to convert from ODT to PDF/PS?

Clearly, the custom shortcut is not case sensitive.\nHow/where can I fix this?\n\nA: It's not the Shortcut which is case sensitive, but the Phrase. And I don't think making the shortcut so is possible. And here's a reason why. If you enter in the phrase section a sentence, or a word, in lowercase, the way you use the shortcut will define the way the phrase will appear. Lets clarify this a bit.\nHaving the shortcut me: whatever, writing Me will be replaced with Whatever, and writing ME will be replaced with WHATEVER, and, of course, me with whatever. \nThis won't work if you've used any capitals in the phrase section, which, therefore, makes a point.\n", "Q: Alfred extension or equivalent that brings a single window to the forefront Right now, if I want to switch to a Sublime Text 2 window open to a \"project\" called foo, I can do option+space, type Sub hit enter and then hit cmd+` repeatedly until I arrive at the window I want.\nIs there any way to manipulate this in Alfred, or using any other shortcut so that I can simply type the name of an open window to switch to?\nI tried writing an AppleScript, but once I got part of the way done, I realized there is no way for me to communicate this list back to Alfred to make a selection:\non alfred_script(q)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set procs to processes\n        set windowTitles to {}\n        repeat with proc in procs\n            try\n                if exists (window 1 of proc) then\n                    repeat with w in windows of proc\n                        if w's title is not \"\" then\n                            set titlename to proc's name & \" — \" & w's title as Unicode text\n\n                            if q is in titlename is not false\n                                copy titlename to the end of windowTitles\n                            end if\n                        end if\n                    end repeat\n                end if\n            end try -- ignore errors\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n    return windowTitles\nend alfred_script\n\n\nA: If you have the full Alfred version, then you can map hotkeys to application launching and switching.\n\nFor example, as you see on the screen I've mapped option-1 for MacVim, option-2 for Chrome, etc.\nIf the app is not running it will launch it but more importantly if the app is running but not focused, then it will simply switch to that app.\nI hope that helps!\n\nA: Are you using Alfred v1?

Drives are great - but either logic board or something else is causing internal failure problem. I don't want to spend any more money in repairs or replace just yet.  So my question:\nCan I just use a 320-500 GB USB memory stick to replace my internal drives?  Are there any downsides like speed, reliability, etc. I know it's a pain to walk around with a stick poking out of my USB port but I am seeing 500 GB sticks for under $50 as opposed to shelling out the big bucks to repair the logic board or buy a new Macbook or Air.  Any thoughts?\n\nA: Yes, you can do this, provided your system will successfully boot from an external volume still. Failing logic boards don't always do this. Each time you boot you will need to hold the Option key down.\nThe speed will be noticeably slower, maybe even painfully so. The internal drive connects at 3000Mb/s. A USB 2.0 stick will connect at a peak speed of 480Mb/s with regular throughput being much slower. \nThe largest USB stick you're likely to find is 32GB or 64GB. A 320GB+ drive will be a full portable external hard drive, much bigger than a simple USB stick. And bear in mind above all else that this is not a long-term solution. Your logic board will only get worse over time, not better.\n\nA: It may be worth checking the connections of the flat ribbon cables going from the SATA port on the motherboard to the HD.  It is possible that one has become unseated.  You can check iFixit for specific instructions, but checking the seating is a lot cheaper than a new laptop if it works.\nAdded: \nhttp://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Datatraveler-310-Flash-Drive/dp/B0039PBFNE\nIf it is too good to be true, it is.  It is unlikely that you have found someone selling a drive for 17.50 that is selling on Amazon from reliable sellers at 200-300 dollars.\n", "Q: Eject disk and get error message \"Disk not ejected properly\" when unplugging disk I have an external USB Western Digital disk I use for Time Machine backups.\nI eject the disk, the disk icon disappears.

There was some minor damage that the disk had. Disk Utility was able to fix the problem, and the dialog box no longer comes up when I unmount the disk and then unplug it.\nI'm still trying to understand how this would cause the error message. It took over 40 minutes for Disk Utility to scan the disk before this problem showed up on the Disk Utility log. The error was Invalid leaf record count (It should be 23755134 instead of 23755132).\nAs I stated before, the Console doesn't show this issue. In fact, looking at the mount and unmount on /log/fsck_hfs.log, I see this entry:\n/dev/rdisk2: fsck_hfs run at Wed Mar  6 18:35:07 2013\n/dev/rdisk2: ** /dev/rdisk2 (NO WRITE)\n/dev/rdisk2:    Executing fsck_hfs (version diskdev_cmds-557~393).\nQUICKCHECK ONLY; FILESYSTEM CLEAN\n\nwhich pretty much means a quick check on mount finds no errors.

I have a 27\" ASUS PB278Q display equipped with a display port, the monitor has a resolution of 2560x1440. \nIf I connect to my thunderbolt port using a mini displayport to displayport cable will it maintain the ultra hi-res of 2560x1440 which is what Apple claims Thunderbolt can produce?\n\nA: I have a 27\" ASUS PB278Q connected to a late 2012 mac mini using a mini displayport to displayport cable, and it is stunning!\nI tried HDMI and DVI but neither of these solutions worked past 1080p.\n\nA: I use displayport from my rMBP to run 2 externals @ 2560 x 1440.  Displayport from and mac device should handle that resolution just fine.\n\nA: This discussion in the Apple Support Communities says to use the Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort Cable to get the full resolution with your monitor.  That thread also tells you to avoid anything to do with HDMI which is unable to sustain such a high resolution.\nCaveat: Whilst I do have a late 2012 Mac Mini, I (sadly) do not have the ASUS monitor.  You may want to wait for a first hand answer from someone who owns both.\n\nA: I have a 27\" ASUS PB278Q connected to a late 2012 mac mini using a mini displayport to displayport cable, and I have 1920x1080 :-(\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4654055?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: I have the same ASUS monitor and a 2012 Mac mini, but I'm running Ubuntu 15.10.  I love the 2560 x 1440 resolution.\nSometimes the monitor fails to detect a signal from DisplayPort; when that happens, I have to switch to using the HDMI connection for a while before switching back to using DisplayPort.\n\nA: Use thunderbolt docks hdmi to the monitor. I was able to run 2012 Mac Mini with both Thunderbolt Display and ASUS 27\" monitor at 2560x1440 each just fine. So far no problems here. \n\nA: HDMI supports resolutions above 1920*1080 just fine, just not on Mac. I have a 29 inch display with a resolution of 2560*1080 that works just fine through HDMI on my windows pc. However when I connect it to my Mac mini Mac OS X doesn't give me the option itself.\nWith SwitchresX I was able to set the resolution to 2560*1080 @51Hz which may not be ideal but still is perfectly fine. Since the program is only free for the first 10 days I finally settled with the less expensive mini displayport to displayport cable option.\n", "Q: User profile transfer, apps which are/were not PPC show up as PowerPPC I have tried using the Migration Assistant, straight copy/paste using Firewire disk mode, and even a clone using Clonezilla...\nBoth machines are 10.8.2\nThe old computer in System Information under applications shows apps as either Universal or Intel.\nOnce migrated to the new machine (newly imaged, and re-imaged between each attempt), almost half the apps show up as PowerPC and will not run.\nWhat's going on, any solution, anyone seen this before?\n\nA: I had forgotten about how great Carbon Copy Cloner is! I have not used it in quite a long time (last time I used it, it was free; they do offer a fully functional trialware version for 30 days).\nI retried all attempts I listed in my question, including only transferring a single user profile (data, applications, etc) using the Migration Assistant with no change. Each time I finished a migration, clone, almost 50% of my apps were being seen as PowerPC applications and would not run...even though they were in fact Intel/Universal apps.\nI believe the underlying problem was that the recovery partition on the two machines differed. I'm surprised Clonezilla didn't wipe it out (It cloned the 3 partitions)! Carbon Copy Cloner on the other hand, informed me of the difference and offered to clone over the difference. That difference was only the fact that the destination machine had a Lion OS in the recovery partition. Both machines were imaged with Mountain Lion.\nThat's just a guess, but because nothing else worked and CCC did, I'm leaving it at that unless someone else can offer some insight. I hope this helps someone in the future. I've never seen or heard of anything like this.\n", "Q: How can I make crisper screen shots on MBP Retina? So we all know that the Retina has a double density screen. As such, when I take screen shots they are 144ppi instead of 72ppi. These are great when I am looking at them in Photoshop, but if I paste them into an e-mail or post them to my blog, they're twice as large as they should be. Scaling them to 50% makes them look terrible.\nHere is a screen shot I took directly, and should be 400x170 px, but it is clearly larger than that (click here for direct link, which shows it is actually 800x340 px):\n\nIf I bring it into Photoshop and change the resolution from 144ppi to 72ppi, it switches to the right dimensions, but the resampling is absolutely terrible (direct link):\n\nI just want crisp screen shots at the right size, without losing the beautiful crispness of text during normal usage. In other words, I'm hoping there is a solution to this problem without changing this setting (sorry the screen shot is double actual size!):\n\n\nA: I'm afraid that there really isn't a way to do it.  I've been running into the same issue.  The effective resolution at 1440x900 is actually 2880x1800 pixelwise- so the reason that you see crisp text is because you are looking at an image with 2880 x1800 resolution on a capable display. Because scaling down usually involves smoothing, the images will look terrible in email /on other peoples computers.\nOne solution is to download a program such as SwitchResX that allows access to \"non-HDPI\" resolutions.  This would allow you to set the display to a true 1440x900, take the screen shot, and switch it back.\nBest of luck!\n\nA: Retina Capture claims to perform a 1x screenshot by redrawing the screen at lower resolution rather than scaling down the image. \nThe quality of the capture depends on the application. In my case (a java application) it didn't really look better than the scaled-down version, but it might work well for others.\n\n", "Q: Window and Menu IDs There's a tool on OS X, and I can't remember what it is for the life of me, that will display what the menu and window IDs are of a selected tab, window, or checkbox.

Is it a LOT slower than common direct USB transfer like on mp3 devices or is it \"ok\" speed?\nAnd I'm using my own mp3s I have on my HDD.\n\nA: Speed is not an issue between iTunes and an iPhone. You can copy gigabytes of data (music, film,...) within minutes, just like with a standard USB-to-desktop connection on Windows or Mac.\nMajor advantage: the synchronisation makes it even faster if you only change a part of your music: it only copies the ones that you added for the first time: no more duplicates!\n", "Q: How do I sort Reminders in OS X?

One will be taken for the connection with my MacMini, the other for the drive, and once time more again, I will be short for a second display.\n\nA: Thunderbolt as a technology supports daisy-chaining devices (connecting one device into another). Unfortunately a number of the devices available like the 2.5\" GoFlex adapter and the video converters don't have the second port to allow this.\nYour option could be to get the 3.5\" GoFlex adapter and mount your drive in that and connect the screen to the second port on that.\nThere are some HDMI splitters on the market but this will just send the same image to each screen.\n", "Q: How to restore calendar events from iCloud?

I have a GPS tracked stored in a GPX file. Now I'm looking for a tool that allows me to set the start time of the track and the duration, and the tool should automatically evenly distribute the appropriate timestamps for all my recorded points in the track.\nThe tool should be free and run on OSX.\n\nA: I'm certain that tool does not exist. That being said, you can open the .gpx file in TextWrangler (free) and view the time stamps and edit them. They are in the XML format:\n<time>2013-03-21T18:04:36Z</time>\nI dont see why you couldn't import them into an excel spreadsheet and alter the times with an algoritm that would add a specific quantity to each. But I wouldn't know how to do that.\n\nA: GPX stores dateTime in UTC, so if you modify the timestamps they will no longer be accurate. The tool you are planning to import this data into should handle offsetting or translating to local time.\nFor example: Adze http://kobotsw.com/apps/adze/\n", "Q: mac asking password after cd in terminal Recently my mac has started asking me for a password after I use cd in Terminal.app (haven't tested other term apps).\nstrangely though, if I press ctrl-C when the passowrd is asked, the question goes away and I'm left in the dir I was cd-ing to (as one would expect).\nhow can I find out what this password is needed for or how to stop this?\nI'm using zsh\nEDIT:\nThe terminal asks for a password at random moments, for random directories. Not a clue as to any pattern. The output is basically:\ncd ~/Downloads\nPassword:\n\nI think this started happening after I installed JewelryBox.app\n\nA: You can run set -x to make zsh print a trace of every command it executes. When a command is executed by a function, the function name is printed. Run set +x to stop printing traces.\nIf something is happening when you use the cd command, it can be because this is an alias or function. Check with type cd.\nZsh has a built-in feature to hook onto the cd command, so wrappers around the built-in command are rarely used. If the function chpwd exists, zsh runs it immediately after changing the directory. Check what the chpwd function does with which chpwd.\nThere are also hooks that run before and after every command: the preexec and precmd functions. Furthermore, all these hooks have an array version, which is an array of function names. Check these arrays with echo $chpwd_functions, and if there is a function, look at its code.\n", "Q: Two Laptops Sitting on top of Eachother Yesterday, my dad's older Macbook Pro was on the fritz (graphics issues), so he switched to using his newer one.

For giggles, I told him to lift the new one off the old one, and whazam, the login screen appeared.  Is this a coincidence, or is there deeper magic at play?\n\nA: It sounds like their magnetic latches are interfering with each other.

In my job, I have a number of \"always-open\" web applications that are part of my desktop layout.  I always have Trello open, plus two different Stack Exchange Chat rooms.  I also have another browser window that I use like everyone else, navigating to various sites in tabs, etc.\nBecause I always want to keep trello and chat open, and I never want to open links from those sites in those windows, Fluid is a near perfect solution, as it creates a native, OSX app for each window.  I click it, and it opens that site as a stand-alone app, which I can set to open all links in my \"normal\" browser, etc.  I LOVE IT, and was going to switch to the paid version and get my small team on it. (I have no affiliation, just a genuine fan).\nBut I've encountered an issue:\nAt seemingly random times, typing text in a text entry box causes the cursor to leave the box and the window to scroll back up most of the way to the top of the window.\nI've tested this quite a bit, and know this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not accidentally hitting Control, Alt, etc. The only modifier key I'm using is Shift.\n\n*I can't seem to repro it even when using the same text in the same instance it happened.  After occurrences, I literally moved focus back to the box where it happened, deleted the text I was typing when it happened, and re-typed it, but it didn't occur.\n\n*It never seems to happen when I'm not typing text in the box, so I'm pretty sure the issue  is linked to that activity.\n\n*This has always happened to me in a Stack Exchange Chat window, but I don't use Fluid for any other \"text-entry\" sites, so that may not be relevant.  (It's not a problem for SE chat in normal browsers; I've logged thousands of hours doing the same thing in chrome and safari without incident).                                                          \n\n\nSince each fluid instance is essentially an app, I thought there might be some hotkey setting somewhere I had set wrong, but can't find anything of the sort in the app or from online searches.\n\nA: I have had this too. It is caused due the live spell checking service responding late while you are typing.\nApparently, while replacing a mistyped word, the service takes focus of the text box. Usually, this happens so quickly that you don't notice it. But sometimes, the service takes too much time (relatively) to process a word while you are still typing. And if you press Spacebar* when this happens, the page moves up/down.\nWhen this first happened, I thought it  was totally dependent on the performance of your computer and there was no specific way to solve it. \nSafe Reboot - try this first:\nOne day, I accidentally activated Safe Boot. For me, this stopped the problem from happening, even after I rebooted normally. Aside from its normal uses, Safe Boot also clears out caches, repairs permissions, and performs other maintenance tasks. That is why you see a progress bar on a Safe Boot.  But that method doesn't work for everyone.  \nTurn off AutoCorrect - here's a solution that should work if that doesn't solve it:\nThis solution requires you to turn off auto-correct for the app. You can still keep spell-check on, so it will still highlight misspellings; it just won't automatically change them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the affected app.\n\n*Click in the box where you're having trouble when you enter text, to put the cursor there.\n\n*In the menu bar, select Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Uncheck Correct spelling automatically.  You can leave Check spelling when typing checked, so it will continue to show you misspellings as you type.\n\n\n* Pressing the Spacebar when a text box isn't in focus sends a scroll down action to the current page. And pressing Shift + Spacebar sends a scroll up.\n", "Q: How to save half-made service in Automator? How to save half-made service in Automator without making it active, as it is not finished?\n\nA: It does not matter if it's unfinished.

I use handbrake to convert or fix indexes.\nAlso you can give a try to Perian if it'll work in your OS.\n\nA: SmartConverter is a free app available on the AppStore and that does the job.  It has the added benefit over Handbrake that for .flv files it will just change the container and not actually re-encode the video.  Which is quicker and doesn't make you loose quality.\nThe downside of SmartConverter is the ads displayed and that you cannot do batches of conversions.

It can eat up to 3GB or more as time rolls by, and I'm not working with very big files, 50mb max, and only 2 or 3 open.\nWhen I start opening programs everything works fine. It's later on that you see that you have very (and I mean veryy) little Free Ram left. Between 8MB and 15MB. At the same time I have 2.21 GB of Inactive Memory.\nThe machine gets much slower once you get below 150MB of Free Memory, and it's a total lie that Inactive Memory gets released onto other programs to overcome this slowness. It never gets released until you close the program.\nI wanted to post a screenshot of my Activity Monitor but your site doesn't allow it if I'm a new user.\nOnce your Free memory gets to these levels (15MB), the Page Outs start increasing and the Inactive Memory never gets released. It gets laggy.\nPlease don't tell me that a 2010 Macbook Pro with 8GB is not enough to work with Photoshop on small to medium sized files. Normal users (internet, skype, movie watching, etc.) won't have this problem, but if used for design or more heavy tasks (which I believe is this machine's main purpose), it doesn't work properly.\nI think this is a very important issue that has never been addressed. I don't know if Mountain Lion has solved this, but I've searched around and haven't read good comments (they even say it eats up more Ram).\nDo you know if a MacBook Air i5/i7 8GB 256GB SSD will improve on this matter? Do SSD's improve Ram usage?

Whether it's a 2G RAM or 64G RAM machine, Photoshop grabs 70% of the RAM.\nWhen calculating how much space Photoshop is wanting for files. look at the document sizes in the lower-left. I believe the second number is how large the file is when open. That can be a much different size than the first number of how much disk pace a file takes. a 50MB file can easily open up to want more than 500MB of RAM. As it fills up and uses all your RAM, Photoshop starts using Virtual Memory, Page-swapping to work on files.\nBut at the same time, so is VM Fusion. While it's only set for 512MB RAM for the XP, it's also using it's own VM-Scheme in the background. Switching back and forth between those apps will always result in lags while each one give up Virtual-Memory, and takes on Virtual Memory. This will result in lagginess all the time.\nBest bet is to have either one or the other open, but not both, and 8G of RAM for PS6 is OK, but my next lease refresh of 35 Macbook Pro's are all going to have 16G RAM, it's quickly becoming the minimum you want for PS6. I don't know what changed between 5.5 and 6, but all my users really started complaining about speed after I rolled out CS6 onto their machines.\nSSD's are helpful in performance because they are a lot faster than HDD in dealing with Virtual Memory I.E. page-swapping....\n\nA: Start up a terminal and enter purge to free inactive memory. You need to do this every time your free memory reaches nearly zero.\nYou can also use the $4,99 app iCleanMemory from the Mac App Store. It puts an indicator in your menu bar that shows free RAM, and when you click on it, a button shows up that executes purge, for easy acces.\n\nA: My experience with inactive memory is similar to yours and as soon as free memory approaches zero, performance takes a big dive.  An SSD makes a big difference, not because of RAM usage or even because it improves paging speed, but because it makes it very fast to restart a program and release the \"extra\" memory it's using.  I don't use Photoshop and VMware but Firefox, Safari, and Chrome are all memory hungry and don't appear to ever release memory once they grab it so restarting any of them usually is a quick fix.\nMemory usage in Chrome is not as obvious as others because Chrome runs as many separate processes so you don't see a single big number for memory usage.\n\nA: I agree. The memory is not released and I had to sometime do multiple restart to get it released and speed restore back to normal.\n", "Q: Is frequently toggling airplane mode on/off harmful to iPad hardware? I want to try to save my iPad batteries, so I turn on the airplane mode when I don't use the iPad during the day and at night. I could toggle airplane mode on/off for more than 12 times in a day.\nDo you think it's worth it to put iPad into airplane mode when I don't use it during the day? and is frequently toggling ipad airplane mode on/off harmful to iPad hardware (shorten hardware life)?\n\nA: Technically the answer is yes. However, the \"damage\" is insignificant. It is like asking if I use my iPhone to make phone calls will it wear out faster? And the answer is yes. But it is far more likely that your device will become obsolete long before it be worn out from constant \"Airplane\" mode toggling.\nI would recommend putting your device in \"Airplane\" as much as possible to get maximum battery life from your device. Keep in mind you can have your device in \"Airplane\" mode and still be connected to WiFi, so be sure to turn off WiFi when not needed as this will also increase your battery life.\n", "Q: iPhone - power button intermittent I recently updated my iPhone to iOS 6.1.2 and after the the update the top \"power\" button will not consistently lock the screen.

Until a few days ago all of the machines could access all of our file servers, running on Win 2007 server, using just the netbiosname by \"Connecting to Server\" in Finder.  Basically they could reach the share by connecting to \"smb://Server1/MyFiles\".\nWell, a few days ago we migrated one of our file servers (Server1) from a physical box to a VMWare VM.  Ever since that change we have been unable to connect with our 10.7 & 10.8 Macs using our traditional method.  Attempting to do so results in a \"Server not found\" error. The workaround that we've found is that we can still connect using either the FQDN or the IP address, such as \"smb://Server1.Domain.Extension/MyFiles\" or \"smb://160.1.1.1/MyFiles\".\nSome more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Golden Triangle environment, AD providing authentication & OD providing management\n\n*10.6.8 & older Macs can still access by connecting to smb://Server1/MyFiles\n\n*10.7 & 10.8 Macs can only access via the FQDN or IP, smb://Server1.Domain.Extension/MyFiles\n\n*The Search Domain still populates correctly as \"Domain.Extension\" in the DHCP/DNS settings of the affected machines\n\n*Pinging Server1 from the affected Macs is successful, the address populates as Server1.Domain.Extension\n\n*Unbinding and rebinding has no effect\n\n*Comparing the affected, recently migrated, server to our other working server in Directory Utility shows only one difference.  The dsAttrTypeNative:servicePrincipalName value is different between the two.\n\n*\n*\n\n*The working server, Server2, has two values: HOST/Server2 and HOST/Server2.Domain.Extension\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*The affected server, Server1, has three values: HOST/Server1, WSMAN/Server1 and WSMAN/Server1.Domain.Extension\n\n\n\nMy first thought was the SMB compatibility issues that arose when Lion was first released but considering everything worked smoothly until the server migration I can't imagine this is the case.  We also considered DNS but with it pinging properly, and the older Macs & Windows machines connecting properly, we have a hard time believing that.\nHas anyone run into this before or have any ideas?\n\nA: I had been using 10.7 for the last two years, and have a Windows 7 server in the closet that I use to share files with all the Mac and Windows users in our office, of which there are equal amounts of each due to their differing roles (Accounting, Coding, Editing on FCP).  As an Apple support tech, I have seen many of my clients with odd issues as soon as they upgraded, and it made me hesitate to move to Mountain Lion; but I just purchased a new Macbook Pro, and finally wanted to see if I could resolve any upgrade issues I had in order to help future clients.\nOF COURSE! The first thing that happened was my ability to connect to the Windows shares using a Netbios name was gone.  Even with the exact same settings migrating from 10.7 to 10.8, I now had to use the IP address of the server, as Mr. Rabbit above illustrated, or by installing Samba...a daunting task involving tons of Terminal commands. Not interested in overkill; I like the principle of Ockham's razor when it comes to this stuff.\nI decided to take a look at what I could do with this issue, as I attempted yesterday to resolve it but couldn't figure it out.  After a night's rest (and a strong cup of joe) the answer revealed itself.  (I'm running 10.8.4, fyi.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Go to Network.\n\n*Highlight your Network (ethernet or wireless) and click the Advanced... button.\n\n*Select WINS from the Menu items.  Update your NETBIOS name of your Mac.\n\n*Make sure your workgroup is the same as the share you're connecting to.\n\n*Enter the IP Address of the shared resource (Windows machine).\n\n\nUsually it took between 10 and 20 seconds for the network shares to resolve; now they are loading up within about 2 seconds.\n\nA: Our network person figured it out. This was his explanation of the issue & the fix, just in case anyone runs into a similar migration issue in the future\n\nUsing the smbutil lookup command in terminal I was able to see that\n  the Macs were resolving the NETBIOS name of the server to two wrong IP\n  addresses. Since SMB uses WINS to resolve names I was able to find the\n  offending IP addresses by querying the WINS list. I deleted the old\n  ones out and put them in statically for Server1.\nThis happened because converting to vsphere does not bring over\n  network info since it assigns new nics. The new nics picked up DHCP\n  and were then registered into WINS and DNS this way. We changed DNS\n  right away making it work for the FQDN and for Windows machines.\n  Something to do after the conversion next time.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to keep Mac App Store apps in the user application directory?

However, if you hold down the \"Command\" key while dragging your applications, they will move to wherever you drag them.\nIf you want to go a geekier route, you can also use Terminal and execute this command:\nsudo mv /Applications/your-application.app ~/Applications/\n\nAfter promting for your login password everything is fine. Be sure to be administrator of your system.\nThis certainly works for me. I can use the application as usual and it receives all updates via the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: LAN Chat via OS X Server — Will Messages App Suffice? I'm setting up a network for a small business with two geographic sites, which will be run on OS X Server.\nWe need a \"chat\" tool of some sort, and the contents of those chats could possibly contain sensitive data we can't store on someone else's servers.\nDoes Apple's Messages app for OS X (Mountain Lion or greater) and iOS fit the bill?  I've never set up something like this before, so I'm not sure if every message sent/received via Messages app hits Apple's servers at some point.\nIf Messages isn't a good fit, please suggest possible alternatives which would work across Mac & iPad?\n\nA: You have a couple of options using native Apple tools:\nApple's iMessage service utilizes free iCloud accounts. The service works with the Messages app (both on Mountain Lion & iOS). All messages are routed through Apple's servers. Certificate-based encryption is used, but Apple does not document its exact nature or whether the messages get unencrypted on their servers. Here are some resources that might be helpful for looking more into this option:\n\n\n*\n\n*IMFreedom\n\n*iCloud Security\nOS X Server also has a Messages service that can be turned on. This creates an in-house messaging service based on the Jabber/XMPP protocol. It is by definition secure, as it routes through your in-house server. It works natively with Messages and/or iChat on the Mac (depending on OS X version) and works with a variety of apps available on the App Store. This is the way to go if you are seriously concerned about security of your conversations.\n", "Q: Record long webcam video / avoid re-encoding / save video-capture instantly I want to record a very long video, approximately three hours, over an external webcam.\nShort videos work very fine with QuickTime and its built-in \"New Movie Recording\" function. As long as they are short, you can choose to save the file \"unchanged\". Apple calls this to save the file \"[…] in the same format as the original\".\nThe option \"save a movie file that contains media in the same format as the original movie\" mentioned above strangely disappears at my three hours video. \nMy webcam needs 180 MB disk space per minute in 1080p, so a three hour video roughly weights 30 GB.\nThis export takes a quite, quite long time and I do not want to re-encode it and also want to save it in the same format as the original movie.\nAnother question is if there is a possibility to save the file instantly while recording? I am afraid of losing my video if my Mac crashes somehow. Also iMovie is not capable of this. Requirement is that I want to save the file \"as it is\" in 1080p, or how Apple calls this \"in the same format as the original movie\" and not down scaled or anything like that.\nI appreciate every help concerning QuickTime or iMovie and also suggesting of any other applications.\nHere are some screenshots. The second and third one are triggered either by closing the file or choosing \"export\" from the file menu. The option is ONLY available for small videos. For my large video there are options like \"audio only\", \"Mac and PC\", \"480p\", \"720p\", \"1080p\" and so on.\n\n\n\n\nA: Quicktime can't encode and capture at the same time that's why the files produced are so big.\nAdobe provide Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder free.\nYou should try with it.\nBe aware that encoding live 1080p take a lot of ressources.\n", "Q: Where does iTunes store my iPhone and iPad backups? Where does iTunes store data for iPhone and iPad backups? I know that—on a Mac—the following folder is ostensibly the only location.\n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\nI actually replaced this with a symlink to an external hard drive to free up space on my laptop, and was thus a bit surprised to find that backing up my iPhone nevertheless continued to decrease the free space on my laptop's hard drive. I eventually discovered that the following folder was the culprit.\n~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media\n\nAre there any other folders that iTunes uses for its backups?\n\nA: Mobile applications (.ipa files) are stored in the following folder and can take up a lot of space:\n~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications\n\n\nA: Based on @Strah's response, I did a quick search for \"MobileSync\" on my mac and found the folder with the backups. You should be able to find yours here:\n/Users/(USERNAME)/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\nHope that helps\n\nA: The backup file location on Windows system: \nOn Windows 7/Vista, the file is stored in: \\Users\\ (username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\nOn Win XP, the file stored in: \\Documents and Settings\\ (username)\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\n", "Q: Mac equivalent of /etc/nsswitch.conf for PHP chroot I've setup a chroot for my PHP server running behind nginx on mac.\nIt works except for any call to a CURL request fails with an error like cURL resource: Resource id #43; cURL error: Couldn't resolve host 's3.amazonaws.com'\nMost guides to setting up a chroot environment say that you should map certain files to be available inside the chroot. The only file I can't find to map is /etc/nsswitch.conf which apparently doesn't exist on Mac.\nWhat is the equivalent file on a Mac? Or what file/socket should be made available to the chroot environment to allow DNS lookups to work?\n\nA: It turns out that on OSX the DNS lookup is done through the service mDNSResponder service which is running as a socket at /var/run/mDNSResponder.\nIt does not use /etc/nsswitch.conf or /etc/resolv.conf so there is no way of mapping those files into a chroot. Instead it's a better idea to use a localhost proxy.\n", "Q: iPhone/iPad GMail Stopped Sync'ing Properly I have a couple of GMail accounts which I track on my iMac, iPhone, and iPad. On the iOS devices, both of the accounts are setup as Exchange accounts with Push delivery. I read that this is the recommended way to setup iOS with GMail and everything has been working flawlessly with this configuration for years.\nA few days ago, the iOS devices stopped sync'ing properly. They receive all inbound emails immediately. However, if an email is read or deleted on my iMac, this isn't reflected on the iOS devices at all unless I force-quit the email app and restart it. It's getting really irritating because the iOS devices are constantly showing unread mail even when my inbox(es) are completely empty.\nWhat happened? Does it have something to do with this latest iOS update (6.1.2)? The release notes said it had something to do with Exchange but I didn't read closely because technically, I don't use Exchange and I figured it didn't apply to me. Did they screw something up somehow? Shall I revert back to prior iOS version?\nAny ideas appreciated.\n\nA: Go to mail, contacts, calendars>Fetch Data> check every 15 minutes!!\nTook me a few minutes and found no one posting this fix!!\n\nA: Google has shut down all gmail pushes to iOS devices as of Jan 30. If you device was setup prior to that date, you're grandfather'd in.\nPersonally, I'm looking at switching to outlook.com. It has full exchange support and it quit easy to move all contacts and emails from gmail to outlook.\n\nA: What worked for me was to turn off the sync on the account.  Then I went in and set up sync label by label.  I did this because I noticed the trash folder was not set to sync, and I couldn't turn it on.  With the sync off for the account, I was able to sync the trash folder.  Now my deletes on the phone sync to gmail via the web.\n\nA: Turning off 2-Step Verification will revert you back to push changes.\n", "Q: How do I make messages on iPad stop interrupting my music I use messages on my mac and enable it on my ipad as well. When I play music (spotify) on ipad, it keeps getting interrupted by the iMessage. The interruption is the dimming of the sound. This is very annoying. How do I stop that?\nNote that I don't want to stop imessage from coming in. But on the iPhone, when the phone is on silent and I am playing music, new messages don't disturb my music. I want that same functionality with the iPad.\nThanks.\n\nA: You do this by turning the iPad onto silent in a similar manner to iPhone. The difference is the side switch is configurable on iPad.\nIf you have the side switch set to \"Lock Rotation\" then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double tap the home button.\n\n*Swipe right.\n\n*Tap the sound icon to mute the device.\n\n\nIf you have the side switch set to \"Mute\" then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggle the side switch like you do on iPhone.\n\n\nYou can change the side switch configuration in Settings.app -> General.\n", "Q: Python IDLE can't be opened by double-clicking .py files in Finder I can't open .py files in IDLE by double-clicking them in Finder (IDLE is currently set as the default program for opening such files).  Nor can I open those files by right-clicking and selecting IDLE.\nIf IDLE is already open I can open .py files through the File > Open method.  Once IDLE is open I can also just double-click .py files and they will open in IDLE.  Finally, in the Terminal, I can open .py files just fine by typing idle -e file.py even if IDLE has not yet been opened.\nI just can't open IDLE itself by double-clicking on .py files, or by right-clicking on .py files and selecting IDLE.\nI'm using OSX 10.8.2 and Python/IDLE 2.7.3.  Anyone know how I can fix this?\n\nA: You can right-click on a python file and select get info. Near the bottom of the get info window is a section that reads Open With. You can select a version of Idle to use. There is a button below that reads change all. If you click this, then all files with .py extension will be opened with idle. Just tested this and it works.  Below is an image indicating the relevant points.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You don't need to install python 2.7.3 on ML since it's default.\n\n*If you really need custom installation of python (if you need special site packages for example), you need to install it from mac ports or from home brew (I do prefer mac ports). And rule custom packages from that location.\n\n*To make IDLE runnable from your python installation you have to resolve all dependencies such as TKinter.\n\nPackage systems such as Brew and MacPorts and others often split Python base to python core, python-tk and python-sqlite3 depending on the package manager and maintainer opinion. Package name may vary and easily searchable.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro changing desktop picture randomly I just got back from vacation and while on vacation I turned my computer off for the 5 days I was gone. I just now turned it back on and my desktop picture was changed to the galaxy photo which I know I didn't do because it was a picture of my dog when I left. It was locked in my basement so I know that no one could be messing with me. I also have noticed that my computer is running a little slow, but I don't know if that has anything to do with it? Also I know there is a setting that you can choose to have it change your picture every 30 min. or so, but I checked and that wasn't the problem for desktop 1 or desktop 2.\nHow can I prevent this happening in the future? Or this an indication of a \"deeper\" problem?\n\nA: We have seen this on occasion.  Our solution has been to:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to Desktop & ScreenSaver (Apple>System Preferences) \n\n*Choose a different photo (or folder)\n\n*Change the \"CHange Picture\" time to something different.\n\n*CHange back both (\"change picture\" time and photo) to original settings.\n\n*close Preferences tab..\n\n\nThe theory we hold is that the preferences are sometimes getting corrupted, and over-writing/re-writing is fixing it....\n\nA: This can happen if the location of the image you had set as the background image is changed (e.g. the picture was moved or deleted).\n", "Q: Preventing google search for custom top-level domain How can I prevent safari to redirect the user to the google search page for addresses with custom top-level domains?\nGiven an address of the type http://application.test where test is a primary zone on our intranet, if I enter either:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://application.test\n\n*application.test/\n\n\nThen Safari correctly resolves the name and opens the page, if I enter:\n\n\n*\n\n*application.test\n\n\nThen Safari assumes it is a search query and redirects the user to the google search page.\nIs it possible to prevent this in any way which does not involve the user itself?\n\nA: To just avoid connecting to Google, open Safari's preferences, click on \"Search\" and then change the search engine to something else.\nTo prevent that domain from going to any search engine, add a Safari bookmark with the full URL (including the http:// or https:// protocol). Once the domain is bookmarked it should come up when the user begins typing the name in the address bar.\nThe user's machine will still need a way to route traffic to the custom domain, either via DNS settings, or by adding an entry to the /etc/hosts file on the user's machine.\n\nA: Yes, it frustrates me too, but I'm afraid that there is no easy way to accomplish what you need. Possible workarounds I found are:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a proper domain name, preferably the one you already own. From my experience, this is a common practice, instead of using made-up TLDs.\n\n*use Firefox, which attempts to resolve custom TLDs.\n\n", "Q: installation in terminal I am trying to install a few software packages on my Mac os X 10.6.8. The packages are the python libraries:\n\n\n*\n\n*networkx (graph library)\n\n*matplotlib (visuzlization)\n\n\nIt seems that with matpotlib I also need numpy and scipy. Anyway, what is the easiest way to install packages with a mac? I have used pip, and easy install. They both seem to install everything correctly, but nothing works after I install. It appears during upgrades that the latest version does not override the previous version of the package as it should.\nIn the past I have used Ubuntu seamlessly, and now my mac has been giving me some trouble with installation. All help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: The reason why Ubuntu works is that it has a package manager for all code, that is python and binaries. pip is a python installer and works in OSX for all pure python packages and simple C packages but seems to have issues with the more complex ones.\nThe nearest think to Linux's package managers are the package managers that deal with code ported from other Unices e.g. Macports, Homebrew, Fink. With choose one and one only as they can conflict (I use macports) and then use it for all possible ports.\nIn your case installing matplotlib would automatically install python, numpy, scipy etc\n", "Q: How can I fix a missing color in emacs? I used homebrew to install emacs, replacing an older version of unknown provenance. At startup emacs complains Unable to load color \"dark cyan\" and some text in my elisp files is invisible: I see (require '   ) instead of (require 'foo).\nThere don't seem to be any references to dark cyan in my .emacs.d/ files, so I think dark cyan must be part of the default scheme. How can I fix this?\n\nA: After banging my head against the wall for a while, I found http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.macintosh.osx/6639\n\nDelete this file:\n~/Library/Colors/Emacs.clr\nand dark cyan should come back.\n\nSo I quit emacs, moved that file to ~/Library/Colors/Emacs.clr-, started emacs again... and it worked.

I stored my music collections ( mostly in .m4u extension) in Dropbox folders, while I play these music files in itunes, I fount that Dropbox continuously sync these files. \nWhat does itunes write to these files and how can I disable it? \n\nA: I would go to apple store in London to ask them see what they say\n", "Q: iOS updates getting listed slowly When I check for updates on an iOS device of mine, the results takes quite a bit of time to get listed. And even sometimes they don't and I've to restart the app by killing it. Although the speed when downloading something from the App Store(whether it be a new app or an update) or any other Apple store is pretty good. It's just the updates trying to get listed that takes quite a bit of time.\nThis problem isn't just tied to me as well. It happens in other devices that belong to my other family members whom I use the same store account for purchases.\nIn my opinion, this isn't a network problem as well because everything other than trying to get the updates listed is pretty fast.\nI would have said this is because I live in Turkey and I'm in the USA App Store with the help of store credits but then again everything other than trying to get the  updates listed is pretty fast!\nAlso our Mac updates show up pretty quickly.\nSo what do you think might be the problem?\n\nA: I don't think that this is an issue with your network or your device. I have the same behavior on all my 5 iOS devices and so does everybody else I talked about this topic.\nI guess the slowness comes from within Apple's datacenter(s). Checking for updates is a \"bigger\" process I guess (checking your apps, asking the database, etc.) than \"just\" downloading, which is pretty simple (establishing a connection, download the data). I just guess that checking for updates just needs some more web service requests than downloading. And since this is done by millions of users, the queue may take a while until your request is processed.\nSo my answer is: I think you can do nothing about it.\n", "Q: Can I safely delete from my iphone photos shared by friends? I would like to free some space on my iPhone 4S by deleting my local copies of photos from a friend's photo stream. Can I do that without affecting my friend's originals and without signing out from the stream? Ideally, I would like to do that selectively, i.e. delete some of the photos and keep others. Also, I would like to continue to receive my friend's newer pictures.\n\nA: Photos of a shared stream can only be deleted by the owner thereof. Once deleted, this photos will be automatically deleted from any device of anyone subscribed to the stream. \nThe photos you've previously saved to the Camera Roll, for instance, won't be deleted, though. \n", "Q: Is there official documentation about upgrading your iOS app's minimum requirements? There are a couple of questions addressing what happens when you upgrade the minimum iOS of an app and there are still users on older iOS versions. \nThe answers don't seem to agree with each other. Some say that the user sees no update, but others say the user does see that there's an update available, but that she should update their iOS first.\nTo get rid of uncertainty, I was wondering if anyone knows if there's official documentation from Apple about this and where to find it?\nupdate\nThe question here is an example of the question being answered, but only for the case where the device is actually capable of updating to the new iOS. The answer is also enlightening, but fails to provide any official Apple documentation on it.\nThis documentation might not exist (I couldn't find it), but I thought it worthwhile to throw the question out there. \n\nA: Nope, not yet at least. Whenever my apps need an upgrade to their minimum requirements due to a new version of iOS, I always have gotten an email explaining everything.\n", "Q: How can I get tab completion back? In terminal, if I try tab completion in a directory e.g. Movies, instead of the movies beginning with S (if I type S followed by tab, I see SetFile, Splitforks and SystemStarter. I suspect I installed something which has messed with my PATH variable. How can I get correct path completion back?\nOSX 10.8.2 on Early 2011 Macbook Pro\n\nA: In the Terminal, at the start of the command line, tab completion is looking for an executable file that is on the PATH (unless a specific directory is indicated). \nWhen you are looking in the Movies directory, and the current directory is likely not to be on the PATH so it will find the three files indicated. \nIn order to find out where these files are, you can use the which command:\n$ which SetFile\n/usr/bin/SetFile\n\nTo find the contents of the current directory, you would type the ls command. That should list the files that are in the directory. For more information about all the files, type ls -l.\nOnce you have a command shown, tab completion will look for a file in the current directory to use as an argument.\nIf you are looking to do something with a movie, you'll need a command. You might want to type open. So, type open Stab, and it should do the tab completion magic for you. The open command will open a file as if you double clicked on it. You can find out more about the open command by typing man open. \n", "Q: How to access my .ssh folder for Transmit or Cyberduck? I\"m trying to connect to my linux server which uses public key authentication. By default, the .ssh folder is hidden on my mac (which I can access via the terminal). However, when I try to setup a connection using either Cyberduck or Transmit, the Finder popup that opens does not show the .ssh folder.\nHow do I select the key ?\nOne alternative would be to copy the key to a directory outside the .ssh folder. But i'd definitely like to hear other solutions. How are you doing it ?\n\nA: In the find file window, press Command-Shift-G.  It'll ask you what folder to navigate to.  Enter ~/.ssh and press return.\n\nA: You need to tell Transmit or Cyberduck to show your hidden folders. The . in the folder name is part of why it is hidden. \nIn Transmit, there should be a menu option in View -> Show Invisible Files. Cyberduck may have a similar menu option in the View menu, but it may say Show Hidden Files. \nThis will let you see it in the application. If you need to see it in an Open file dialog, press cmd + Shift + G` while the open dialog window is open. This will drop down a \"Go to the folder\" screen. Type in the hidden folder path you wish to navigate to and that folder will now display in the open dialog window.\n\nA: Open the Terminal window on your MAC (by default you will be in Home dir):\nType :\n$ ls -la\n\nThis will list all the files & folder including hidden folders.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 iOS 6.1.2 Keyboard -> Shortcuts not working properly It was all working fine till I was on 6.1, I upgraded to 6.1.2 and restored my backup from  iTunes after which I noticed that the text-expander is not working. for e.g. when I type \"omw\" it doesn't get expanded to \"On my way!\"\nI tried a lot, reset (Home + Power), installed Xpander2 from Cydia, etc etc.\nI again restored the iOS but did NOT restore old backup this time and started fresh setup.

I would like to know, is there a way to control your iPad with your Mac remotely (be able to see and manipulate iPad's desktop on your Mac)? I know that with the TeamViewer or other programs you can control your Mac with your iPad but not vice versa.\n\nA: There's a tool (made for testing purposes) with the ability to do that, first released on July 18, 2014: iOS Gateway\n\nEnjoy!\n\nA: It is not possible to remotely control the screen of an iPad unless you jailbreak and install a VNC server as MattDMo suggested. This is because the security model in iOS does not allow an app to reach outside of its sandbox to control other apps or the springboard home screen. Apple does not provide any remote control functionality at the iOS level either. There is no way to do what you are asking for without jailbreaking.\nMobile Device Management (MDM) solutions do not allow remote control of the screen on iOS either. MDM can push configuration profiles to control settings on an iPad, or prompt the user to install an app from the app store, but they can't control the screen. Airwatch offers a screen control option, but this only works on platforms that support it (not iOS). I work with several MDM vendors, including Airwatch, and this is not possible because Apple does not make this functionality available in iOS.\n\nA: There are a couple of options. iKeyboardRemote is an app that claims to do just what you want, and is free. However, after installing it, it seems like it's limited to pressing the home button, looking at Pictures, and playing music. \nA second option is to jailbreak the iPad and install the VNC server Veency through Cydia. You can then use a VNC viewer like the one from RealVNC to connect.\n\nA: You can remotely control your iOS device's screen using one of many Mobile Device Management solutions, such as AirWatch for example. However, these are enterprise-level tools that are typically used in the workplace. There is no easy way to do this as a home user, unless you enroll in such a program.\nYou can also jailbreak your iPad and install a VNC server.\n\nA: Here's one (extremely limited) way that I can think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can mirror the iPhone screen using QuickTime, which will allow you to see the screen.\n\n*Then, for a $9.99 fee, you can control the keyboard of your device using 1Keyboard.\n\n\nA: You can try Reflector to mirror iOS devices on Mac.\nAccording to this tutorial, you can use their 7-day free trial to wirelessly mirror (but not control) it, assuming the devices are on the same WiFi network.\n", "Q: Is it possible to not keep ios apps on your main computer? I sync my iPhone and iPad with my MacBook. It appears that iTunes stores copies of all of my apps on my MacBook, even though I, for obvious reasons, can't actually use them there. The problem is that they take several gigabytes of space. Is there something I can do about this?\n\nA: Make sure that app syncing is disabled between your Mac and iOS devices (which you can double-check in settings within iTunes when device is plugged in). Then go into Apps section of iTunes and delete all of the apps. With iCloud and iTunes Match I stopped syncing my iOS devices over a year ago and there is absolutely no need to have these apps backed up on your computer.\nIf you need help managing your syncing, see this article on Apple's Knowledge Base. You will essentially want to do the opposite of what it says.\n", "Q: How to hide Gmail labels in Apple Mail? When searching for mail in Mail.app with a Gmail account, every instance of the mail shows up with every Gmail label, especially in the Bin label, since Apple mail autosaves drafts as you go along, there can be 50 instances of a single mail just in the Bin folder.\nThis makes searching impossible.\nSo I'm trying to turn off those labels in Gmail but no success so far. I have disabled \"Show in IMAP\" option in the Gmail label settings for all those labels then deleted all the cached items in ~/Library/Mail/V2 and restarted Mail.app but that didn't do the trick.\n\nA: I'm going to suggest that you use this tutorial to make GMail and Mail.app work together.

However I have no idea how to bring my PDF file from iBooks to Foxit reader. \nDo you have any idea?\n\nA: I'm afraid it's not possible. I tried several times to do that.\nMaybe you'll want to use an app like Documents by Readdle on your iPad? That way you can manage your books from there and open them everywhere you want to.\n\nA: Here's what works for me, I email the PDF to myself (my account allows for files up to 50mb) I then read it in Mail and select \"Open In\" and choose Adobe Reader and voila it's now added to the documents list in Adobe Reader.\nThanks to tex_mex from https://forums.adobe.com/people\n\nA: Here's a work around that worked for me:\nStep 1: \n\n\n*\n\n*Email yourself a PDF copy from iBooks-must be to an account accessible from iPad\n\n*Open iBooks\n\n*Open PDF to transfer\n\n*Tap top of PDF & tap 'share' icon in upper left (rectangle w/arrow rising out of it)\n\n*Email to yourself (account that you can access from th e iPad; I used my @me.com address)\n\n\nStep 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access email, open PDF & use \"Open with\" option to open in app of choice\n\n*Open email\n\n*Tap on PDF to download>then tap on it to open it\n\n*While open, tap at top of PDF, tap 'Share' icon, & tap 'Open with' your app of choice ( if app you want not showing, tap 'More')\n\n\nA: You could try importing a copy of the PDF.  For example, if you right-click a PDF in the Books section of iTunes, and then choose \"Show in Finder\", you can see where iTunes stores the file.  For me, it's in Music->iTunes->iTunes Media -> Books -> [authorname] -> [pdfname].pdf.\nThen, in the File section of the Apps tab for the device (still in Itunes), you can select your PDF viewer of choice, press the Add button, and select the file you found above.  If you select a file manager instead (say, File Pro or similar), you can then use it to open the PDF file with any compatible viewer.\n\nA: I don't think you can bring the PDF file from iBooks to Foxit reader. \nexcept you use another PDF reader such as Foxit Mobile PDF for iOS Pro. \nHmm, Im familiar with PDF viewer on Mac, and also got some cool tools such as PDF Magic for Mac to manage my PDF files, but not so familiar with iPad PDF files. \n\nA: I found a simple way to transfer PDFs from iBooks to any other app you have on your iDevice... However, you must be jailbroken for this to work.\nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Cydia, download and install PDF Printer (it's in the BigBoss repo) \n(Note: your iDevice will respring once PDF Printer is installed)  \n\n*Open iBooks and open the PDF file you want to transfer.  \n\n*In iBooks, select the option to print / email PDF\n\n*Choose print option\n\n*Once print option box appears, choose PDF (to the right of \"Print Option\")\n\n*Once PDF is \"Printed\" choose the open in icon on the top left of page\n\n*Open the PDF in the app you want a copy kept in, such as PDF Expert.  \n\n\nI know it seems like a lot of steps, but it's not.  It's really simple and MUCH easier and faster that emailing each iBook PDF to your self and way more convenient than syncing through iTunes.  \n\nA: After connecting iPad to Laptop go to your apps on iPad and select PDF reader which you have installed on iPad. After that select option to add file and select your book. Now open your PDF reader and you will have your book.\n\nA: Install the PDF reader first (Foxit in my case). Upload the file on Google Drive, and then open Google Drive on iPad. After this, tap keep the file on device. Then, tap open in option (this will appear in Google Drive when you tap on i in the icon of the book on the drive). From there, you can select your preferred reader.\n\nA: I've no idea how to export PDF from iBooks to another PDF Reader app in iOS, but you can use iTools software on a Windows PC to do that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install iTools in Windows.\n\n*Go to \"Books\". It's reachable in top menu. This part has access to the iBooks PDF.\n\n*Select the books you want to open in other app.\n\n*Click \"Export \" and give it direction in Windows.\n\n*Go to \"Applications\". It's reachable in top menu.\n\n*Find your favorite PDF app you've been installed like \"Foxit Reader\".\n\n*It has a icon=\"file share\" in front of it. Click it.\n\n*Import your PDF and ePub and texts you've exported in step 4.\n\n\n\nNow you can share PDF files with AirDrop in \"Foxit Reader\" app and have all that books in your favorite app.\n\nA: If it is a book that you downloaded, you can download it again.  It will give you options like, Open in iBooks, on the top right.  On the left it will give you an option of, Open as....  Select that and then choose the app you want to use to open it (i.e. Copy in Foxit).\n\nA: *\n\n*Open up the Safari browser on your iPad.  \n\n*Find the download link of the original PDF file.  \n\n*When the file downloads and populates your screen, touch the screen.  \n\n*Two options open up on the top of the screen: \"More...\" and \"Open In iBooks\".  \n\n*Click \"More..\"\n\n*When \"Open File In...\" pops up, choose your preferred PDF reader/editor.  \n\n*Edit said document in said PDF Editing app.  \n\n*Smile!  You've just figured out a workaround.  \n\n\nA: There is great program called Diskaid check it out. you can put files directly to foxit.\n\nA: Put files into Dropbox and then download into other reader. I will do this to use Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nA: This IS the EASIEST way:\n\n\n*\n\n*open PDF in iBOOKS\n\n*email PDF to self\n\n*open your MAIL (from apple mail box, NOT GMAIL APP)\n\n*download and open PDF\n\n*open in foxit\n\n\n:)\n\nA: a am a complete DOLT about these things - had downloaded a pdf copy of a book to ibooks and wanted to be able to highlight it.  no deal.  i downloaded iannotate after reading the comments of others.  then i re-downloaded the book pdf's link to my ipad (where i want it for travel) & among the choices of where to \"park it\" (my term) was iannotate. i selected it.  it downloaded.  it opened.  i've highlighted.

Is there a place on the Apple website where I can suggest features for OSX/iOS to Apple?\nFor example, I want to suggest that you can drag Launchpad folders to your Dock.\n\nA: Apple maintains a Product Feedback area on their website for reporting feature requests and bugs from the general public. Here is the OS X feedback page.\n", "Q: Book manager - Mac + iPad I've been an Apple user for some years, but I never managed to find a good book manager.\nAs by now, I use a quite uncomfortable routine in order to read books (I should mention that most of the books I read are PDFs, I read a lot of open source books on computer science):\n\n\n*\n\n*I download them on my Mac\n\n*I add them to iTunes, and I edit their properties by, for example, taking advantage of the composer field to store informations about the publishing house and the genre field to store the \"topic\" of the book (which is awful, I can't group books based on these details, just based on author/category)\n\n*I sync all of my books with my iPad, and I read them only from there (using iBooks), because I don't like the fact that on my Mac I haven't got a version of iBooks (what I need is a system that remembers the last read page, for instance)\n\n\nWhat I'm searching for is an iTunes-like book manager that provides me with a desktop version which lets me organize my books properly (for example adding multiple authors, tags, categories, publishing house), sync them with my iPad (with last-read-page syncing at least) and read them in a proper way.\nWhat I mean with proper way is that while both iBooks and Kindle app let me switch from white to sepia to black background on eBooks, they won't let me do that on PDFs. I know that changing text size in PDFs is quite an hard task, but I don't think changing the color is too.\nIf someone is wondering, I already tried Papers 2, but it's most suited for academic papers than for books (in my opinion). If nothing comes out from this question, maybe I'll try to stick with Papers for a while.   \n\nA: Calibre is one of the best open source eBook Management tools:\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/\nFeatures include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Library Management\n\n*E-book conversion\n\n*Syncing to e-book reader devices\n\n*Downloading news from the web and converting it into e-book form\n\n*Comprehensive e-book viewer\n\n*Content server for online access to your book collection\n\n", "Q: Internet connection in Germany for iPad 2nd gen I have to say first, I am clueless about it all, including the jargon. I have just spent phone time with ATT, and I have learned I will not be able to tether (that means create a hot spot from my iPhone 3GS, right?). I have the lowest data plan now, but am willing to change to the highest limit for the trip. but, apparently that won't make a difference in the ability to tether. \nI have to be able to tether with my iPad. I can't even understand if I will be able to use my cell at all, muchless live stream or upload. I just don't know enough about any of this stuff. A numbered list of exactly what to do as well as some definitions would be so helpful. Tech jargon related to this subject will not make sense to me, keep in mind. I'm not stupid, I just haven't been exposed to it all.\n\nA: Forget AT&T in Germany! \nGo to any local store (in Germany) and buy Prepaid Internet service SIM card. For that your device has to be UNLOCKED. That means the AT&T is not longer the sole provider (ask them).

Is there a way of doing this?\n\nA: You can remove your phone number from Messages on your Mac and iPad. On your Mac, go to Messages > Settings > Accounts. Select your account. Uncheck the box corresponding to your phone number. On your iPad, go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive. Uncheck your phone number.\nYou cannot remove your phone number from receiving messages on your iPhone, because this is also where your text messages come in. However, you can set your email address as the default. This will guarantee that all new messages sent from you will show your email, and all responses will come back that way. Go to Settings > Messages. Select to \"Start new conversations from\" your email. I hope this helps.\n\nA: You can remove a phone number from receiving messages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iMessage and FaceTime under Settings\n\n*Remove SIM Card\n\n*Reset network settings: Settings/General/Reset/Reset network settings\n\n*Insert SIM card\n\n*Turn on FaceTime and iMessage\n\n*Boom, it works!\n\n\nA: If you want to remove your phone number from your iMessage account, go to http://appleid.apple.com and press the button for \"Manage your Apple ID\".\n", "Q: Can't download Mountain Lion from app store on a Mac already running Mountain Lion? I am trying to download and/or acquire an operating system installer for my newly purchased Mac. My objective is to put this onto some form of removable media (USB ideally) such that in the event that my tinkering renders the Mac unusable, I can fix it.\nMy initial understanding was that I needed to purchase OS X from the app store. I am trying to purchase OS X 10.8.2. I am running 10.8.2. Yet the app store responds with \"sorry, this is not compatible with your Mac\" !!\n\nSo that's out. So, question time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this the right way to achieve what I want, bearing in mind I explicitly want removable media with a full installer?\n\n*If so, how do I convince the app store that it is being silly?\n\n*I hear rumblings that the installer can be fished out of the recovery partition? Be this true? If so, where on this volume is it (I can mount it, and I looked around, but I don't see anything that looks like an installer).\n\n\nA: I would head over to http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1433 and follow the instructions for making a USB Recovery drive.\nAlso note if you hose your machine you can boot with Command-R to enter into recovery mode.  Even if you hose your recovery partition, if you have an active Wifi connection, Apple will pull down the OS from the cloud.\n\nA: An alternative method to the one described by Matt is to use Lion Diskmaker. Despite its name Lion Disk Maker is an application programmed with AppleScript that you can use with Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7 and OS X 10.8 to burn a DVD or build a bootable drive from Mac OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion Installation program.\n\nA: If you have a newly-purchased Mac, it probably runs a version of OS X Mountain Lion that came out after 10.8.2 was already released. What this means is your Mac actually requires a version of Mountain Lion that is newer than what is available on the Mac App Store. The one on the App Store does not have all the requisite drivers bundled in to talk to all of your hardware.\nIn the future, once 10.8.3 is released, you will be able to successfully download that from the App Store, and use a tool like Lion DiskMaker to make a bootable copy.\n", "Q: Use time machine for backing up a different computer I've been over many faq's and troubelshooting but can't seem to find an answer to this.\nI'm currently running my mac from an external HD. My internal got corrupted, I can't repair it with disc utility. So I booted from an older time machine backup, on an external HD which now is my main HD and what I'm running from.\nAnyway I want to put everything back the way it was. Meaning erasing my internal and let time machine put back a back up of my current workspace. But when I let it run he backs up the corrupted internal one. It even makes for a total of 500G, and my original HD is only 320.. so I'm making a backup to big to be used to restore later.\nHow can I change that he backups only the external information? Or maybe I'm wrong and he needs to back up the internal to for things to work since I still use it as my computer (but not my HD). I don't need the content of the original HD to be backed up along with my external one. I just want the workspace I created with a back up on my external to be put back on my erased, internal one..\nI'm also worried if I erase my internal HD the booting help progam (C or R) will be gone to.. will it?\n\nA: To exclude your internal drive from backup, do the following. Go to System Preferences > Time Machine. Click Options... Under the section titled \"Exclude these items from backups\", click the + button. Select your internal hard drive. This will prevent Time Machine from backing up your internal hard drive.\nIf your external hard drive is working just like you'd like your internal hard drive to work after you finish fixing it, you can also restore your external volume onto your internal volume. To do this, boot into Recovery Mode (holding R upon boot). Once booted into Recovery Mode, follow the steps in this Apple Support article, under the section Restoring the backup disk image's contents to your internal Mac OS X disk. You can begin with Step 4, as you have a newer operating system than the article was written for.\n\nA: I'm confused, if the data on your internal drive is corrupted you wouldn't want to use that as a source of backup.  \nIf you are running Mountain Lion or Lion there is / or should be a recovery partition on the hard drive (even the time machine version for cmd-r).  \nHowever, using disk utility in the external drive, I would first reformat the internal drive (which still should show up) using one of the security options (overwrite with 1 pass 0 write or DOE 3 pass).  This will keep any rogue (malware or damaging data) from creeping back into the new install.   If the internal drive can't be reformatted you may have a hardware issue that needs to be resolved before attempting to restore.\nAssuming the drive is formatted...\nYou can restore from Time Machine. (but if you somehow acquired malware you will be being it back as well)  or you can install OSX again and migrate the programs and data (only after ensuring all of the most recent security patches are applied)\nIf you install Mountain Lion you will just download it from the external drive you have been working on and when it is complete and stars it will ask where you want to install and the internal drive will show.   Hope that helps.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion way to QuickLook folders The freeware Folder.qlgenerator was already broken by Lion.\ndefaults write QLEnableXRayFolders -bool true\n\ndoes not appear to work in ML. Does anyone have a replacement solution? I’m looking at a large file tree, and I’d like some convenient way to remind myself of what is where.

I got an iPad mini on Wednesday through the post but I opened it to find it damaged. It is only a tiny chip but I rang apple and they are sending me a new one and I am giving this one back. Does anyone think thar it might be possible for me to buy the broken iPad from apple for cheap? It's chipped in the front and engraved on the back so surely it would make more sense for me to buy it as my sister has expressed an interest in it.\nHas anyone been in this kind of situation?\nThanks.\n\nA: As a former Apple employee, I can tell you this is not possible. Apple will use undamaged parts from the one you return to create refurbished units that are sold online, as well as service replacements for Genius Bars. If they shipped you the replacement in advance, you could technically just not return the damaged unit, but you will be charged for it after a certain number of days (I believe 30).\nIf your sister wants a good deal on one I would keep an eye out on the refurbished section of the Apple Online Store, or on Craigslist or eBay.\n\nA: I can't for sure say \"no way\" but I would be amazed if they agreed to it, if nothing else because they have such stringent and complicated internal policies.  Your best bet would be contacting AppleCare or 1-800-My-Apple and working your way up to a manager or tier 2.  You might find someone that can somehow sell you the damaged one with a 10-20% discount.\nAgain, I wouldn't bet on this by any means but stranger things have happened I suppose.\nLet us know if it works out for you!\n", "Q: OS X: Any PDF to Kindle format converter to read technical material on Amazon Kindle? I like to read course material on Kindle. I merge all lecture slides with Automator and then send them to my Kindle email. Earlier, I have used Readle's Documents app (a spinoff of PDF Expert) where I had a search. If no OCR, then DjVU Reader in OS X to PDF and then ABBYY's FineReader Express to add OCR. Kindle has one failure with this: it cannot search despite the OCR of the PDF. It needs to be in a correct format: PDF is not a correct format but some Kindle's own format. \n\nSo does there exist any app in OS X to make material such as lecture slides suitable for reading in Kindle? Lecture slides are technical containing mathematical formulae.\n\nIt requires many steps already over OS X with Automator, DjVU Reader, ABBYY -- to make searchable in one way. I am trying to find an easy way with Kindle and Apple OS X.\n\nA: Calibre is commonly used to convert ebooks (including PDF) from one format to another.  There is no guarantee that it does exactly what you want, but try it with your PDFs.  \n\nA: Reading technical material on Kindle pretty much requires the books bought as Kindle format. This is because technical writing with mathematical formulae look awful after the conversion from PDF to, let say, to Kindle format or HTML. Even the bought books covering technical areas can look awful in Kindle or very impractical because of low screen-updating. Now this is of course different if you use iPad's Kindle but still the conversion is the key problem. There may be some good conversion from PDF to HTML. I suggest to search over things such as Mathjax.org because it is the tool used to display Mathematics for example in Stackexchange. \nDoing technical material into eBook format is pretty hard. HTML-conversions look horrible.\nNow there are other ways. The trick is not to convert the PDF but keep them as PDF or convert DjVU into PDFs after OCR-addition with tools such as ABBYY or Adobe Acrobat Pro. iBook is freaking cool if you have OS X. You can syncronize all of your course material from iTunes to other iDevices. I just found it so now using iPad/iPhone instead of Kindle! Then again if you don't need to read technical material, Kindle can be very good-reading device particularly to your eyes. Please, also look at Nook reading-device -- Kindle is not the only device around.\nReading tools\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's iBook with iTunes in Apple OS X\n\n*Readle's Documents app\n\nA: K2pdfopt is an application that attempts to re-format PDF files for a smaller (e-reader) viewing screen and does a good job of not mangling/losing figures and mathematical formulas.  It has an OS/X binary.

To make this distinction more clear than the small dot, Im trying to find a way to dim the unactive Dock icons, or make them black/white. So far I havn't been able to come up with a solution, though.\nNow I've noticed that Adium changes its Dock icon when it's active or inactive. Perhaps this would be a nice stepping stone - how does Adium handle this?\nEDIT: I went through the Adium sources, but they call [[NSApplication sharedApplication] setApplicationIconImage:image]; to change the icon. Their default is the sleeping bird and they update it at runtime from their application. Seems an impossible solution for closed-source applications, unfortunately.\n\nA: I don't know how to dim inactive icons in the Dock. However, some people prefer the old-style two-dimensional dock that you can activate. It's certainly easier to discern which apps are open on this view.\nTo activate the 2D dock, open Terminal. Then type in the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES\n\nFrom there, you can log off & back on, and your Dock will have changed. If you ever need to revert this setting back run the above command again, but change the word YES for NO.\n", "Q: 128GB SSD and 23GB of sleep image + swap file, what to do? So I've got a 13\" Macbook Air with 128GB, and recently I got a message showing that I'm running out of space, so I did a quick check to see what was taking up all of space, and I found out that I have 4GB of sleep image (which is normal), but 20 swap files, each taking up from 60mb to 1gb.  With a small disk size, this is really unacceptable so I was wondering if it was safe to delete some of the swap files and let the system build them up.  Or would a restart help (Though I'd prefer not, had a bet with my friend to keep my uptime as long as possible :p) Any suggestions appreciated.\n\nA: A restart will definitively solve the issue.\nEven if you kill the offending process, the system won't clear up the swap files - you need a reboot to do that.\nAlso, deleting the swap files would be a bad idea. You would need to sudo to do it, and if the system has the file open, even if you rm the file, it'll still be kept around as the file handle would be open, so you wouldn't gain the space back.\nBy all means try it, but it's not recommended :)\n\nA: You can disable Hibernate to regain your size in RAM on your SSD/HD:\nFirst disable it:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nThen free up space:\nsudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\n\n... if you want to enable it again:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\n\nNote: -a means on charger and on battery, -b means battery and -c means with charger.\nAlternatively if you have more than one disk you can symlink sleepimage to an HD so it can physically locate there.\nSwap\nFirst disable Swap:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\nLater delete the files:\nsudo rm /private/var/vm/swapfile*\n\n... if you want to enable it again do:\nsudo launchctl load -wF /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\n\nA: Another answer already mentioned disabling hibernate, but per the man page for pmset, this is no longer enough to disable the hibernation image (sleepimage) file creation.\nThe docs say, \n\nTo disable hibernation images completely, ensure hibernatemode standby and autopoweroff are all set to 0.\n\nSo we need:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\nsudo pmset -a standby 0\nsudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0\n\nYou can verify your settings before and after the change using sudo pmset -g. Then you can sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage to delete the file, but in my case this was done automatically after setting all 3 values.\n\nA: You can delete the sleepimage without damaging anything. The system will recreate it over time. Usually when I get a message that I'm running out of space I just go to the terminal and type sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage and I get about 9 gigs back but the system will rebuild it over time, so it's only ever a temporary reprieve. \nTo finish answering your question, and to let you know why you should trust me, you can delete every file in var/vm because they are caches of what is stored in your RAM currently. They are not critical... unless you lose power, and in a restart, most of the var folder is cleared automatically. Though, to provide users with steady reporting of their free space, OS X Lion and newer do not delete the older vm files at startup. \nBasically, you'll always have VM files with size roughly equivalent to the amount of RAM you have used running programs. You can delete these and upon the next significant background activity event, the computer may re-create them. If you only have one program running, and doing nothing, but have huge VM files, that may be a sign of a memory leak in a program, but I have noticed that a lot of the preference panels and plugins on the menu bar are really huge memory hogs: If you run the Google Drive Synchronizer thing and the Dropbox app and the box.com app then those will call home 24/7 and move files around non-stop. They are more than enough activity to generate legitimate and huge VM profiles. \nHope that helps!\n", "Q: iMessage conversations changed to Bonjour; how do I change them back? Within the iMessages app on OS X 10.8.2 all of my iMessage conversations have switched to Bonjour. So instead of showing the usual blue bubble it's red and people's phone numbers are shown instead of their contact name.\nIf I go to an individual conversation and click on the down arrow I have the option to change the messaging service from Bonjour to iMessage.\n\nIf I click iMessage the phone number is replaced with the contact name and photo from my contacts, but any previous conversation is gone. If the person then subsequently sends me a message the conversation history comes back.\nThis method does not work for group chats. If I click on a group chat that includes the same phone number I do not get the iMessage option.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to mass change all of my iMessage conversations from Bonjour back to iMessage so I don't have to do it one-by-one?  \n\n*Is there any way to change the group chat back to iMessage?  \n\n*Is there a way to recover conversation history without waiting for a contact to send me a new message?\n\nThis happened after I took my Mac to the Genius bar to get some hardware fixed. When I got it back everything was fine except for iMessage being messed up as described above.\nUpdate: There's a similar question on the Apples Support boards, but the solution did not work for me: com.apple.ichat.Subnet.plist did not exist.\n\nA: In addition to unselecting Bonjour, which I agree was insufficient, I found that under Messages > Preferences, my Apple ID had been deselected.  Once I re-selected it, I could then identify the phone numbers and email addresses I wanted to use with messaging.\nI suspect my original cause was my daughter's wanting me to turn off messaging for her email address (she is young and so her stuff is under my Apple ID) and somehow that turned off the MacBook's messaging entirely, not just her address.  Curiously, my iPhone was affected.\nI also suspect I selected Bonjour in a futile attempt to fix messaging on the MacBook.  Hope this is helpful.\n\nA: Under the messaged drop down menu, go to accounts and then uncheck bonjour.  Your iMessages and/or your iTunes account should be selected. \n", "Q: Registered Apple Developer Agreement when under 18 When I registered to be an Apple Developer, I inadvertently did so without realizing the requirement to be 18 years of age (I was 17 and 6 months away from being 18 at the time).

Is it possible to do this with a jailbroken iPad, if not a jail-unbroken iPad?\nAn earlier answer says it isn't possible, but refers to iPad 2, so I don't know if anything has changed in the 1.5+ years.\nThis is more than a minor annoyance with the otherwise great Incase Origami stand, because the home button is physically blocked with the iPad in portrait mode.\n\nA: This is an old question, but for anyone else coming across it, the answer is Command-H is the shortcut to display the home screen.\nFYI\n\n\n*\n\n*Command H displays the home screen\n\n*Command-Tab shortcut displays the task switcher\n\n*Command-Space toggles the search bar\n\n\nA: Here is an iPhone perspective with the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard. \nMy keyboard is a little older, and for whatever reason CMD + TAB doesn’t bring up the App Switcher nor switch between apps on the iPhone. \nCMD + H = Home Screen. \nCMD + S = Search.\nCMD + TAB does nothing.\nUpward pointing triangle which on the Mac used to eject a CD toggles the on-screen keyboard.\nƒn key toggles the emoji keyboard.\nCNTL+SHIFT will toggle off any secondary keyboard language you may have activated to your preferred keyboard language.\nNote: there are two ƒkeys, or FUNCTION+[ƒkey]. set up for multi-app + switcher (above the 3 and 4 keys, respectively), but neither seems to work on the iPhone.

Where will I be able to find said drivers?\n\nA: Apple does not support this officially, but I've used the windows 7 one and installed Windows 8 without any problem.\nI can start my Windows bootcamp without any issue and Windows 8 runs like a charm.\n\nA: According to the official Boot Camp support page:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1638\nBoot Camp 5 adds support for Windows 8 (64-bit) and the new drivers support both Windows 7 (64-bit) and Windows 8 (64-bit). Unfortunately, Boot Camp 5 doesn’t support 32-bit Windows 7 and Windows 8.\nSo, Mac users have no option but to install 64-bit Windows using Boot Camp. However, the previous version (v4.0) of Boot Camp supports 32-bit Windows 7.\nThe support page also notes that Boot Camp supports upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8, provided that you install Boot Camp 5.0 drivers on your Windows 7 machine before upgrading to Windows 8. If your Mac comes with Fusion Drive, it turns out that Boot Camp Assistant will help you install Windows on hard disk drive, not the Flash drive even if you have sufficient free space. Also note that Boot Camp doesn’t support installing Windows on external hard drive.\nThe download size of Boot Camp drivers (5.0.5033) is 553.62 MB and supports following Mac models:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air, mid 2011 or later\n\n*MacBook Pro, mid 2010 or later (MacBook Pro 13 inch mid 2010 isn’t support)\n\n*Mac Pro, early 2009 or later\n\n*Mac mini, mid 2011 or later\n\n*iMac, mid 2010 or later\n\n\nDrivers for Boot Camp 5:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1638\nBoot Camp 5 Frequently asked questions:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639\n\nA: Apple's latest version of Bootcamp 5.0 Clearly states supports for both 64x versions of Windows 7 & 8.  I cannot verify this as I am downloading the information  now, but this is a change in verbiage.  They no longer state that Windows 7 is required to Install Bootcamp.\n\nA: It's true there's no official support, but good news even for first generation MacBookPro owners:\n\n\n*\n\n*90% of Apple's Windows 7 drivers work on Windows 8. I'm still using Win7\ndrivers on my 2010 MacBookPro and it all works.\n\n*There's a comment trail on cafe-encounter from someone who successfully got Windows 8 working on a first generation MacBookPro:\nhttp://www.cafe-encounter.net/p1118/direct-download-of-bootcamp-drivers-further-help/comment-page-1#comment-5544\nThe approach was: (1) Run BootCamp and install Win7, then (2) one-by-one install the drivers for MacBookPro2,1 (which is the oldest supported model for Win7)\n", "Q: Unable to login after accidentally powering down laptop as FileVault decryption of HDD was running I had turned off FileVault on my FileVault-encrypted HDD. While the HDD was decrypted, I accidentally powered down my laptop interrupting that decryption process. When I subsequently rebooted, I am able to click on my username and enter my password, but then instead of displaying the Apple logo, my laptop displays the \"No entry\" traffic sign and proceeds no further.\nNow my OS X Lion 10.7.6 system (on MacBook pro 13\" 2011) no longer boots after a restart. \nI have booted into Lion Recovery to repair permission but Disk Utility will not mount my HDD and instead reports error (-69846).

And if so, where is the best place to look for since Apple does not have them theirselves?\n\n\nA: Battery degradation is normal, and seeing that your battery is almost 4 years old has went through 820 cycles, you battery retention is still quite good. Degradation of battery is irreversible.\nIf you really want to get a fresh battery, you can take it to an Apple store. It'll cost somewhere around $150.\nApple replace defective notebook battery only within 3 years of purchase with AppleCare, so you wouldn't get that benefit.\n", "Q: How can I script Preferences changes in an application?

I've tried almost anything else available online, without success. Updating to the latest version via restore (without the blobs) is no problem ofcourse.\nWhen you jailbreak your device it will store the SHSH blob on Cydia server, as you can fetch them from their servers with your current device UID if lost.\nA SHSH blob is a small piece of data with Apple's signature connected to your device ID.\nSince you can only validate iOS versions with your own device ID, there's currently no way to install previous versions without having \"your\" blob.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to save the contact from who I received an SMS?

While I do find Notes.app very useful, especially due to the iCloud integration with iOS counterpart apps, I am very annoyed about the text formatting used by the application.\nI just want to be able to copy text from web pages and paste it as plain text in this application.\nIs there any way to obtain this? Maybe some Clipboard manager that can work in background, or even another application that I can use to obtain this.\nWhile I would like to keep bold and hyperlinks, I do not want to keep any fonts or sizes when I paste the text.\nNote: the solution should be transparent — not requiring me to use extra steps for pasting, ⌘V only.\n\nA: You can use OptionShift⌘-V to paste and match the current style. This removes all previous formatting, links, etc.\nIf you would like to make this the default action when pressing ⌘V, open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts, and select Application Shortcuts from the list on the left. Then, hit + to make a new shortcut, select Notes.app from the dropdown list, enter Paste and Match Style exactly in the Menu Title box, then hit ⌘V with your cursor in the Keyboard Shortcut box. After hitting Add, you can flip back to Notes.app and click on the Edit menu to see that the shortcut has been reassigned.\n\nA: You can select the text in Notes app, then Format -> Font -> Remove Style.  Unfortunately there's no keyboard shortcut for that command :/\n\nA: Once you have copied the data. Instead of doing cmd-v, go to Edit -> Paste and Retain Style.\nLook at this tutorial for creating a keyboard shortcut: https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/something-copy-paste\n\nA: I actually found the keyboard combination difficult and it doesn't work in Word and Excel.

Is it at all possible to extend an Apple wireless network with a non-Apple router such as this? \nI can connect to the Netgear box via Ethernet to configure settings, but I'm curious first if this kind of wireless extending is even possible.\n\nA: Unfortunately Apple based networks cannot be extended using non-Apple devices. Even though in theory it should work without any problems, Apple has restricted using 3rd party routers to extended wireless network, and vice versa, non-Apple based wireless networks cannot be extended using Apple routers.\nThe workaround is to connect both, your Airport Express and your Netgear using Ethernet cable and enabling bridge mode in your Netgear settings page. Bridge mode disables creating second sub-network in your LAN, making Airport Express your default DHCP server.\n\nA: The short answer is yes. The brand of the hardware doesn't matter, as long as it has the capabilities you're looking for. They all use the same 802.11n (or maybe g, not sure about which generation is which) networking protocol, so as long as you set the new one up to rebroadcast you should be all set.\n\nA: Really, it depends if the router in question supports extending a wireless network. If your router doesn't support this feature, you could use the AT&T device as the main router and use the Airport Extreme to extend the network.\n", "Q: Stopping iOS backspace deleting whole words or lines? Background\nEven though I have owned every iPhone from the 3G onwards I have NEVER mastered the backspace key. If you hold it to delete a few words it almost ALWAYS catches me out and starts deleting whole words and then whole lines (if you keep it pressed).\nI just want it to continue deleting one letter at a time until I remove my finger. If I want to delete huge blocks I would highlight them. :)\nQuestion\nIs there ANY way to prevent this? \nMy iPhone 5 is Jailbroken so I'm sure there must be a way but no matter how much searching I do I can't for the life of me find it.\nThanks\n\nA: SwipeSelection\nWhile this does not 'fix' your backspace you can use the 'shift' key en swipe over the keyboard to select the text you want to delete. avoiding you to have to hold down the backspace\nCheck out the video in the link.\nWorks on iPhone and iPad.\n", "Q: Stop Apple ID change address page from kicking me out I'm having troubles with my Apple ID.

When I was going through my contacts today, I noticed a lot of email adresses stored along with the other numbers. I didn't even know most of them! What has happened?\n\nA: This is likely because iOS 6 has Facebook and Twitter contact import. So, if you logged into your Facebook account on your iPhone, it will automatically go through your contacts and pull in information that it finds in their Facebook account.\n\nA: It may be a longshot, but in addition to the Twitter/Facebook contact import mentioned above, are you perchance using Gmail, and syncing iOS to your Google Contacts via CardDAV? \nIf so, you're probably seeing Google's 'My Contacts' in your address book. For every person who sends you an email, Google keeps a record of them in your Google Contacts. The unfortunate side effect is, if you ever sync your Google Contacts to another contact list (such as your iPhone address book), it winds up passing all of those one-time contacts into your address book by default.\nEqually as unfortunate is that there's no good way to prevent it, aside from not syncing your Google Contacts with your iPhone.\n\nA: If you use Mail for OS X, and you sync contacts with iCloud, it is possible you accidentally added contacts by selecting several Mail messages and pressing Cmd-Shift-Y (the action for \"Add to Contacts\" instead of Cmd-Shift-U (the action for \"Mark as Unread/Read\"). Since these commands are one key apart, and there is no user confirmation required for the \"Add to Contacts\" action, users can perform this action by mistake without realizing it. If that is what happened to you, you would unfortunately need to go through your contacts one by one to eliminate unwanted information.\nTo prevent this from happening again, you can change the keyboard shortcut for the \"Add Sender to Address Book\" and \"Add Senders to Address Book\" menu items in Mail for OS X with the System Preferences application. Here are steps to do that. I am referencing Lion, so the menu item names or the keyboard commands may already be different in Mountain Lion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the System Preferences application\n\n*Choose the Keyboard icon to view Keyboard preferences\n\n*Choose the Keyboard Shortcuts tab\n\n*Press the + button below the list of shortcuts\n\n*In the Application popup, choose Mail\n\n*For the Menu Title, enter \"Add Sender to Address Book\" (without quotes)\n\n*Tab to, or click in, the Keyboard Shortcut box, and type Ctrl-Opt-Shift-Cmd-Y\n\n*Press the Add button to save the new shortcut\n\n*Repeat the process and use \"Add Senders to Address Book\" (without quotes), the plural form of the menu title, for step 6.\n\n\nA: It synchronizes your contacts in FB and Twitter to your phonebook. Its not a random thing though, unless these people are anonymous or people you have no idea about.\n\nA: Also, if you check to see your mail account setting on the phone that may be enabled. We have seen where exchange mail account is adding random emails in our employees phones.\n", "Q: Ping graph utility I am having connectivity problems with my broadband and want to create some evidence for/with comcast. In particular, I'd like to run a continuing series of pings and get a graph out. All I've been able to find are utilities for Windows, or apps (like ping command itself) that just put out a bunch of one line messages. Does anyone have a recommendation?\n\nA: So a little while ago I was having wireless problems and wrote a little monitoring tool that was really just a wrapper around ping. I still find it useful for displaying current connectivity at a glance.\nBut I also added the ability for it to write a log of its connectivity, and then wrote a perl script to parse the log and display a summary graph. It sounds like just what you're looking for:\n\nThe only hitch is that I developed it on Linux, but from what I can tell, ping should work the same on a Mac.

Why dont you just show that to Comcast.\nTo clarify, not sure you want to monitor the Ping, but the signal strength.\nMaybe if you tell us about our broadband set up will help further. You said you have broadband with Comcast. That menas it runs over TV cable. Ask Comcast to measure signal strength at your site (coming in to home, and at your computer). Faulty TV cable splitters can be the cause of your problem.\nRunning a Constant Ping on a Mac\n\n*\n\n*Click on the \"Application\" icon and click on \"Utilities.\"\n\n*Double-click on the \"Terminal\" icon to open Terminal.\n\n*Type \"ping\", followed by the IP address you want to reach, for example ping 192.168.100.104 and press \"Enter.\"\n\n*The program continuously pings the IP address. Press Ctrl-Cto interrupt the constant ping.\n\nThat will not grap it, but least you will have the data.\nor try ProteMac Meter\n\nA: How automated to do want it? You can use any online pin utility (such as PingTest) and do a screen capture for each trial. Three or five pings should be enough to convince Comcast!\nAlso, Mac OS X has a ping utility built in. In Network Utility, select the Ping tab and enter in a server to test. You can select it to run indefinitely, or for a certain amount of pings.\n\nThis will give you an easy-to-read text output.

Recently it would not boot up. I removed the battery and it did. However after a shutdown, later on it did not boot up without battery. Only after I reinserted the battery and after waiting for a few minutes did it boot up again. I heard that I should use a 65watts Power Adapter and not a 45watts. However, when I search for a power adapter based on my Powerbook's Apple Order number: M8981LL/A and/or the Model Number: A1046 - I sometimes get a match with a 45watt adapter and other times with a 65watts adapter. So, which adapter should I use with my Powerbook?\n\nA: In practice, I've never seen a properly working 45 watt adapter not be able to boot a properly working PowerBook when you remove the battery.\nThe 45 watt adapter was intended for smaller devices and would often not be enough to both charge and run a 15 inch PowerBook in all situations even when everything was working properly.\nAt this point, with ten year old equipment, it's possible you will need a 65 watt adapter or have some power management issues with the adapter or the Mac.\nThat Mac should have a 65 watt adapter for best results, power on and charging since the G4 and battery do need that much power to work as designed.\n", "Q: Old home folder not recognized after upgrade, how to recover?

I am a software developer currently working on a Macbook Pro Retina 15\". The Retina display on my Macbook Pro works well for me.\nI am considering a 27\" Apple Thunderbolt Display.\nIs the Apple display significantly more glossy then the retina Macbook Pro and if so, is it enough to pose a problem after long hours of use?\n\nA: The Apple Cinema Display and Thunderbolt display are excellent monitors for long term use. \nWhether the glossy screen will cause you issues is more about the environment you use it in.  If your room has a great deal of light behind you the reflection might be an issue, but in a normal indoor environment they're fine.\nIMHO, the ACD/TBD doesn't really offer a software developer anything unique to justify it's price premium over average monitors.  I'd buy it for the TB connections, brightness and color accuracy more than anything else, but for software develop those things usually don't matter.\n", "Q: Utility to warn when process takes 100% CPU for x minutes? I run on battery a lot and occasionally a process/app will crash in the background and start sucking up 100% of one or more cores.  That in turn burns my battery down way faster than normal.   I used to notice this because my iStat Menu graph would go solid, but now with 8 cores and often only one pegged it's not as obvious.\nI'm wondering if there's a utility/watcher that would pop up a dialog warning if a process took up 100% of a core for more than 5-10 seconds?  That way I could decide if it was OK to let run (ie. compile/render) or I should manually kill it (ie. app crashed).\nI vaguely recall something like this years ago but haven't been able to find it.\n\nA: I don't know if it will accept a time frame as a parameter, but atMonitor definitely will provide Growl notifications based upon specific criteria.\n\nTriggers\nTriggers can be setup to activate any script when a predefined value reaches its target. For example, a script could be written to email system administrator when the CPU usage goes above 90%. Two sample scripts, one basic and the other one a little bit more advanced using GROWL, are included.\n\n", "Q: What technical requirements need to be satisfied by a DVI KVM for these two Macs? I have a Mac Pro (2008 eight core 2.8 GHz), a MacBook Air (mid-2011 Core i5 1.7 GHz), and a 30\" Apple cinema display (maximum resolution 2560x1600). I have a mini displayport to dual-link DVI adapter for the MacBook Air.\nI want to set up the cinema display with a 2-port DVI KVM that fully supports both of these machines, ideally with ports for both DVI and USB.\nWhat are the technical requirements I need to know about to ensure full compatibility with my hardware? Is it possible that some DVI KVM products would not support the maximum resolution of my cinema display?\n\nA: I've used Teleport, a really neat pref-pane that functions as a software-only KVM switch. Moving the mouse off of one screen onto the next accomplishes the switch. I used to use it with a Macbook and an iMac next to each other on my desk, controlling either one with a single keyboard and mouse. \n", "Q: App store updates won't download I changed my Apple ID password.\nI can log successfully into my Apple account using my new password online.\nI can download songs from iTunes using my new password.\nBut When I go into App Store, and select \"Updates\". I click on Update tab for App, I get prompted for my Apple ID Password. I enter my new password, click OK, the \"UPDATE\" tab flashes from \"INSTALLING\" back to \"UPDATE\". Update  does not complete! \nThis happens on both my iPhone and iPad and I can't get past it. \nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Did you try via the settings > iTunes and App Store? Click Apple ID and logout and back in.\nLogin again there, and that did the trick for me.\nEDIT: My problem was solved when I removed iCloud from my iPad and iPhone and logged in with new credentials.\n", "Q: How do I install hp officejet printer 4610/4620 onto my apple 4th generation IPad? I have an HP Officejet 4610/4620 attached to an OSX machine, and I would like to print to it from my 4th generation iPad Apple - how can I achieve this?\n\nA: This should be as simple as downloading and installing Handyprint (previously known as AirPrint Activator) which will share out an OSX printer on your wireless network as if it was an Airprint one.  Check it out here.\n", "Q: How to tell a macmini to stop booting to Windows from a macbook pro? I need to be able to control a mac mini without a screen and I think using screensharing would be enough. I've enabled screensharing, setup a manual IP address and I have an ethernet cable. \nThe problem is I don't have display to use on the mac mini and I currently borrowed a keyboard and a firewire cable to setup screensharing: \n\n\n*\n\n*booted mac mini in target mode (wish there was a way to do it without the keyboard)\n\n*booted the macbook holding the alt key and choosing the firewire drive\n\n\nThe problem is the mac mini has a bootcamp partition setup to which it boots by default. I googled a bit and tried the System Preferences > Startup Disk option then the /etc/fstab route but no joy: the mac mini still boots to Windows.\nHow can I get the macmini to simply boot to it's osx all the time (given that I have to change the settings on a macbook with a firewire cable) ?\n\nA: The system stores the boot choice in NVRAM, so you might reset it by powering off and then holding command-option-p-r while you hear the start chimes repeat 2 or 3 times.  At that point, it should choose the first bootable system on the internal drive. IF that doesn't work, you could post the filesystem layout - but a corrupt NVRAM settings file would explain why your choice of Startup Disk wasn't respected.\n", "Q: Fixing a corrupted OS X Mail structure after an import of mailboxes from the previous system volume Due to various and persisting problems, I had to reinstall 10.8.2.\nWhat I did\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down iMac with internal system disc A.\n\n*Started 10.8.2 recovery system\n\n*Copied iMac's system disc A to an external disc B as an image using Disc Util\n\n*Erased system disc A as HFS / journaled\n\n*Run a clean install on A\n\n\nThen, I told OS X Mail to import old mailboxes from B into the fresh Mail system.\nUgly result\nUnfortunately, I got tons of tons of deeply nested folders, which eventually contain email:\n/Import-5\n  V2\n     POP-something\n        Drafts\n          0563726277\n              Data\n                   9\n                     7\n                       8\n                          Mails\n                            <this folder finally contains some emails>\n\nNot hardly to see, I can't use these imported folder structure any more.\nQuestion\nIs anybody aware of a tool to fix such problems?\n\nA: That \"ugly\" result is not a corruption or mistake, it's the way the Mail folder is structured now.\nIf you've been messing with its contents, I'd suggest emptying ~/Library/Mail/V2 and starting over again from your original source, re-importing or using Migration Assistant. \nNo, I don't know why either. \n\nA: Actually, I believe what Apple does is create a folder structure of their own and encapsulate it in a .mbox file; it doesn't adhere to the mbox standard though.  See screenshot 1, this is inside \"Receipts.mbox\":\n\nWhat I did was import the .mbox files one layer deep.  This is tricky because the Import dialog won't let you go \"into\" a .mbox \"file\" (which is actually a directory in this case); you have to navigate into the folder from the finder and then drag it to the import box to force the dialog to go there.  Alternately you can use the \"Go\" command with cmd+shift+g:\n\nAnd then when it seemed to come into my mail cleanly,\n\nI re-exported it and found that this was the result, which I think is adhering to the mbox standard.  See how the emails are now concatenated into the .mbox file, as opposed to stored in folders and then eventually as .emlx files with the attachments being separate?  Re-importing them on the original machine this way yielded good results.\n\nNote that this was all on macOS Sierra 10.12.1.\n", "Q: Comparing iPad mini data plans; Why choose AT&T, it has fewer countries and is more expensive? I'm trying to choose between the various data plans for an iPad Mini.  Based on this chart it appears that the ATT model (A1454) only works in North/South America, while model A1455 is supported worldwide.\nFor this reason (limitation) I assumed the ATT plan would be least expensive per MB/Month, however it is the most expensive per month:\n  ATT       250MB per month $14.99\n  SPRINT    300MB per month $14.99  (better value)\n  Verizon     1GB per month $20.00  (best value)\n\nWhat is the value in the ATT network or related technology that I'm missing?\nFinally, I've been told that GSM operates worldwide, are both these models GSM or CDMA?\n\nA: The value of any particular carrier is based on the performance of the carrier in the area you will use the device.\nie. My area has great AT&T coverage, Good Verizon coverage and horrible Sprint coverage.\nYou are also only comparing the cheapest tier. Prices change and one carrier may be cheaper than another at a different level of service.\n", "Q: Missing backups from Time Machine A have a MacBook running Mountain Lion that backups up to a Linux machine over afp (netatalk) using Time Machine. \nIn Time Machine preferences I can see that the Oldest backup was on 5th March 2012 (a year). If I go to 'Enter Time Machine' I can old go far back as 4th of March 2013 (a week). Using the 'tmutil' command I can see 43 backups from 2012 until an hour ago. \nThere has never been a problem with space on the Linux machine and there has been little change to settings or software on either computer for over a week. \nIs there a way I recover from these missing backups? How can I prevent this occurrence from happening again? I do not need anything from this backup at the moment but I still want the ability to do so.\n[EDIT] So one of the comments below got me thinking. There are two interfaces on this computer. One is set statically with a hostname and IP address, the other is by DHCP and takes the default Mac OSX hostname.\n\nA: I suspect based on the comments, that Mike Meyers has a point, in that you are only seeing  MobileBackups, and that tmutil is simply showing you pointers (or logs) to the Time Machine backups on the linux server. For some reason the actually backup on the drive is not readable by Time Machine. I suggest dumping the network drive to an external, OS Extended Journaled hard drive and see if you can point Time Machine to that.\n", "Q: Messages Video Chat In Messages Preferences, under Audio/Video it reports my MacBook Air (running OS X Lion) does not support video chat, even though the green FaceTime camera lights up and Skype supports this fine on the same computer\n\nHow can I fix this?\nI have added more Information, using messages \"Connection Doctor Capabilities\" it say no camera, and my build in FaceTime HD is grayed out (but the green light goes on) and the audio is working! It also says my connection is slow (that is true), but is that the reason the camera does not go on ? I am in Spain, Costa del Sol, and thats all the WiFi I can get from my location.\nSorry for my English but thats the best I can do.\n\n\nA: It's possible you have another program that has made a lock against the camera which is preventing Messages from seeing the message. For example, if I start Skype and the camera LED is green, I get the same error from time to time.\nIf you check to be sure Skype and any other programs don't launch at boot, you might reboot your Mac and try messages first. Also, after the reboot, check for any system updates in case there's an oddball issue with drivers that could be corrected. It's been a long, long time since I've seen cameras not work, but making sure your version of Lion is patched to the latest version can't hurt.\n\nA: I suggest you rephrase your question a bit, so it is more clear. \nFrom what I understand you want to video chat with someone through Messages? Messages isn't meant for video chatting: that is what FaceTime is there for. When you press the video chat icon in Messages, all it is really supposed to do is open FaceTime and start a new video-chat there. \nI suggest you try opening FaceTime directly, and start your video chat from there.\nUPDATE: Though does support video chat, especially for third party and legacy protocols + Bonjour. When answering before I didn't consider any of these protocols, as this would be one of the main factors to point out in the question, but it nonetheless wasn't. Given the lack of \"I am using Google Talk / Jabber / Bonjour / etc.\", and the little information given, I guessed on the default protocol: iMessage, which doesn't support video chat. Apple has relayed that to the FaceTime protocol.\nI suggest once more that you make edits to your question. The more specific you can get about your problem, the better we can help you solve it. \n", "Q: Can hard-drive benchmark apps damage your hard-drive? I want to measure the read/write speed of my hard-drive.\nI came accross this page recommending Blackmagic Disk Speed Test.\nThere is a frame saying this:\n\nNote: Blackmagic Disk Speed Test puts hard drive under extreme stress during data write and read operations, therefore it’s recommended to save your work before conducting the tests.\n\nNow my question is: Could that 'extreme stress' on my hard-drive damage my hard-drive?\n\nA: Disk benchmarks perform many read/write operations to measure the performance of your disk. It is recommend to save any work as high amount of those operations may cause some applications to slow down and crash by being unable to load/save data from/to your disk.\n\nCan benchmark app damage your disk?\n\nNo, however if your HDD or SSD has been extensively used over its lifetime then it is likely that its health status has decreased, making it more likely to fail. Keep in mind that it would be nothing but a coincidence if it would fail during the benchmark.\n", "Q: How to update my jailbroken iOS 6.1 iPhone to iOS 6.1.2? I had jailbroken my iPhone last month when I was using iOS 6.1, and currently iOS 6.1.2 is available, which solves some battery issues (I am really suffering from these), so I want to update to iOS 6.1.2.\nWould you kindly give simple steps to do that so I don't damage my device? I am not much of an expert on this, so your help is very welcome.\n\nA: It is recommended to update your Jailbroken iOS device by doing full restore form iTunes. In order to preserve your apps, contacts etc. perform a backup in iTunes by right clicking on your device and selecting back up option.\n", "Q: How to keep apps from adding themselves to login items? Today, I noticed that there were several \"login items\" that I'm 99.99999% certain I did not add.  I figure those items added themselves when I installed them (they were probably installations that required authentication).\nOf course, I can always check \"login items\" every time that I install an app (if the installer asked for authentication), but I'd prefer to lock \"login items\" altogether.  Is that possible?\n\nA: Update*\nif you do a get info on the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist file and tick the lock checkbox. \n\nNo changes will be written to the file. Therefor on next login there will be no additions.\nI just tested this and it worked. But cannot guarantee that this may or may not be a good thing to do.  I my self will use my Answer below.\n\nYou can set a launchAgent to watch for changes on the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist file\nIn my example here I use a launchAgent to watch for the change and then run a command to notify me. In this case I use the command tool growlnotify\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>loginItems</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/local/bin/growlnotify</string>\n        <string>-n</string>\n        <string>login items change</string>\n        <string>-m</string>\n        <string>login items change</string>\n        <string>-s</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/USERNAME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI actually made this using lingon which take some of the pain out of making launchAgent.\nThe command I run is :/usr/local/bin/growlnotify -n \"login items change\" -m \"login items have been changed\" -s\nNote this is a simple example. And you should remember that any changes may take a short while to be written to the plist. But my tests have shown it to work. \n\nA: A simple solution: \nAdd that application to your dock. Right click on the dock icon -> options -> uncheck \"open at Login\". \nIf you don't want the application on your dock afterward, just drag it off.\n", "Q: How can I find the IP of my router? We have Bell (Canada) as an ISP. Their service works fine, I can also easily see what devices are connected to the home network via their home network settings.\nAdditionally, I have my own modem, a Zhone 6518-A1-NA. I want to use it as a bridge, so it connects to the home network, and afterwards I can connect my network drive to it.\nThe issue is that I cannot find the IP of that Zhone modem, which is connected via ethernet cable to my computer directly (not the ISP's modem). I reset it, but I can't find the information as of what its IP would be and I can't connect to it to change its firmware or whatever I wish to do.\nIs there a way from the Terminal or the network settings to find out what its IP is? Keep in mind I tried calling the ISP and they said that because I am on a Mac and also because it's not their own product, they will offer no support.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: System Preferences -> Network -> Pick your Adapter -> Advanced -> TCP/IP Tab :)\nSee screenshot here: \nYour computer's IP is marked \"IPv4 Address\" (192.168.1.74) and your router's IP is marked \"Router\" (i.e. 192.168.1.1 in my case).\n\nA: MAC user :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the apple (top left)\n\n*About this MAC\n\n*More Info\n\n*System Report\n\n*WiFi\n\n\nWill tell you the IP of the device you are connected to and more.\n\nA: Looks like the routers default ip should be 192.168.1.1.

I'm trying to assign a static IP for my printer.\nWith Airport Utility 6.2, under Network, I click on the plus sign under DHCP Reservations. All I get is a beep and it doesn't do anything. \nRouter mode is set to DHCP and NAT. \nWhat is preventing me from adding a DHCP Reservation?\n\nA: Download Airport Utility 5.6. This older version of Airport Utility will let you make DHCP Reservations. (I had to resort to this because Airport Utility 6.2 ignored the plus sign under DHCP Reservations. It also ignored the Edit button and needed a \"Force Quit\" to terminate.)\n", "Q: Storing my iTunes library on an external flash drive in a MacBook Air I have approximately 90 GB of music and it is taking up too much of my Macbook Air's 256GB internal SSD space. I see I can buy a 128 GB flash card which can be left in the MacBook Air's flash card slot. Can I just move my library on to the flash card? Has anybody done this? Any advice? Would it be backed up with Time Machine correctly?\n\nA: \nHas anybody done this?\n\nNot with a flash drive, but with an external drive. I've kept my iTunes library on a USB-attached drive for years now. Semantically, the situation is identical to storing it on the flash drive. The OS see's a remote disk in both cases.\n\nAny advice?\n\nFormat it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Most flash media come pre-formatted as FAT32 these days. You don't want that.\nFor moving your iTunes library the correct way see: What is the safest way to move the iTunes Library from one hard drive to another?\n\nWould it be backed up with Time Machine correctly? \n\nAs long as it's not listed in the Exclusions list in Time Machine, yes: it will be backed up. To check the exclusions list: System Preferences -> Time Machine. Click on the Options... button and make sure your flash drive volume isn't listed in that list. If it it, select it, and click the - (minus) button at the bottom of the list to remove it.\n\nA: You are able to specify what gets backed up with TimeMachine, so if you want to backup just your music you can do that and use the flashdrive as your TimeMachine backup. However, this won't allow you to erase the music off of your harddrive. \nI would suggest simply putting all of your Music files onto an external (as you mentioned) by simply dragging and dropping the files, and then deleting it all off of your harddrive (except for any particular music you still want on your machine for regular access). If and when you want to pull a song off of your flash drive, just plug it in and pull it off. \nAnother idea is to look into itunes match (stores all of your songs on the cloud for $20 a year and you don't need to keep the actual file on your harddrive).\n", "Q: Macbook pro 13 2012 (HD4000) 8GB(1600 Mhz) single RAM stick issue I have a Apple Macbook Pro 13\" 2012 IvyBridge HD4000 Model which came with\n2GB x 2GB RAM.\nI Recently bought a single stick of 8GB RAM 1600Mhz (which is compatible).\nGskill 8GB DDR3 FA-1600C11S-8GSQ Notebook Memory for Apple Mac\nhttp://techshop.in/store/product_info.php?products_id=10064.\nI removed both the old RAM DIMM's and placed the New 8GB RAM in upper slot and lower slot but when i boot the system after a few seconds or minutes the display gets \ndistorted and system does not respond and have to hard boot.\nIs it because i'm using only one stick?\nDo i need to buy another same kind of 8GB stick to make it work...\nPlease help.\n\nA: It could be the RAM is just bad. It happens sometimes.\nBut try to rule this out. Reset SMC and NVRAM(why not?) and boot into Apple Hardware Test to check the memory.\nAlso you may try to use new 8GB stick paired with old working stick. If it will be OK than don't try to buy same second 8GB stick it will not work. Though it does mean you can use this module with different fully compatible one it's better to send it back.\nAnyway I would recommend you are buying DDR3L. It's a new and improved standard your model of MBP supports.\n\nA: Your question isn't clear, where you say you put the new RAM in the upper and lower slot. \nDo you mean that you tried the new RAM chip in each slot, and in both cases it produced the same symptom?\nDid you check, can your machine handle 8GB of RAM? \nNo, you don't need matching chips for RAM to work--or even a chip in both slots.\nHave you tried resetting the P-RAM?

It allows you to lock specific GPU to be in use all the time instead of dynamically switching it. It provides HUGE battery life boost, mainly because OSX's GPU switching algorithm is very far from perfect, triggering dedicated GPU on even very basic apps eg Coda 2.\nJust to give you an idea (based on my own MBP 15 2011):\n\n\n*\n\n*Dynamic switching: ~3h on battery \n\n*Locked to integrated GPU: 7h on battery\n\n\nI have found that very often in order to actually lock your GPU you need to select it twice in the app.\n", "Q: iTunes can't sync contacts as contacts has been disabled on iPhone I am getting this error message. \nitunes can't sync contacts as contacts has been disabled on iphone\n\nConfiguration: iOS 6.1, iphone 4\n\nA: *\n\n*back up address book  [File>Export]\n\n*delete all contacts in address book\n\n*delete all files within: library>user>application support>address book\n\n*untick \"sync contacts\" in iTunes - click on \"Sync\" button\n\n*open address book: import file (the backup file)\n\n*open iTunes: tick \"sync contacts\" - click on \"Sync\" button\n\nA: Have you tried restoring the device through iTunes?

Is there a way I can recover it or download it again for free?\n\nA: It's weird that an app just disappears like that! Are you sure it's gone? Before anything I would recommend you do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search using Spotlight (I'm guessing you already did this?) for \"iPhoto\".\n\n*Look inside your Trash. Maybe it was dropped there by mistake. You can always drag it  back out though if it's there.\n\n\nIf you do this but still find no traces of iPhoto, you can go ahead and re-install it. This can be done in two ways: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you bought your Mac before 2011, it should have come with two CDs in the box. One of them should be called \"Applications Install DVD\" (Disk 2). Slide that into the SuperDrive of your Mac, open it, and you should have the option to re-install iPhoto.\n\n*If you bought your Mac after 2011, it probably came preloaded with OSX Lion, and without any bundled software CDs in the box. If that is the case, you should be able to head over to the App Store and install iPhoto from there for free. This should also be the case if you ever bought iPhoto from the App Store. All the apps you buy from the App Store can be re-installed at any time for free.\nHope it helps!

I'm working on a project where I need to convert from pixels to mm and need to find the aperture or sensor size on the FaceTime HD Camera.  Specifically, I have the mid-2011 27\" iMac.  I can't seem to find any detailed technical specifications on the newer FaceTime camera.  Anyone privy to these details?\n\nA: tl;dr - As a starting off point, eyeballing it I'd estimate around ƒ/2.2 - ƒ/2.8 aperture.\nThis isn't an exact answer, I put the iPhone 7+ front camera (which has a ƒ/2.2 aperture and a 'focal length in 35mm' of 32mm) next to the 720p FaceTime HD camera on a macbook. Eyeballing it, the image on the mac seems to be the same or maybe ~5% smaller in FOV. So I estimate around ƒ/2.2 - ƒ/2.8 , maybe ƒ/2.4 in aperture.\n\nA: On the iMac's features page it is stated that:\n\nThe built-in 720p FaceTime HD camera lets you make video calls that are so clear, it seems like everyone’s in the same room.\n\nThis means that the FaceTime HD Camera can offer you a 1280x720 resolution as a hardware maximum, but, it's the software you'll be using it with, which will decide the resolution.\n", "Q: Broken PowerBook G4 My PowerBook G4 is broken and has been for a couple of months now. I owned it while it was working for about 1 and a half years. When it broke originally, I was restarting it after changing the boot logo in the system files and when it rebooted, it just stopped at the bright blue screen that I'm pretty sure comes right before the grey apple logo on a grey background. I left it for a while and it never finished booting. So I restarted it again and the same thing happened several times. \nI then opened up the RAM removal door and saw that there appeared to be slight decay to one of the sticks of RAM. This may or may not be a problem. I removed the RAM and started it and the computer beeps as it should when it doesn't find the RAM when I put the RAM back in, the computer makes the chiming noise, but the screen does not turn on anymore. (By this I do mean that no part of the screen is lit. No backlighting occurs and pixels remain dead.) This is strange because before I removed the RAM, the screen turned on but stopped at the blue screen. \nI also attempted hooking the computer up to another Mac via FireWire and repairing the hard drive. I then got a USB and put Leopard on it. I cannot boot from the USB either. \nI have tried all of the obvious including resetting PRAM and resetting PMU. Neither of these had any effect on the computer at all. I even tried removing the main battery and letting the backup battery charge over night snd that also had no effect on the starting of the computer. I also tried hooking it up to a Mac display and that did not work either. That test may be unreliable, however, as I have not confirmed that the display itself works as I do not have the appropriate cables. \nI am now at a point where I have the computer where it boots up, chimes, but the screen never turns on. I have the Leopard install image on a USB drive, and the hard drive is repaired. (Disk Utility said that it was corrupt and I repeaired it in Disk Utility as well.) I do not need the files that were previously stored on this computer. It previously ran OSX Leopard. Any other ideas on what I could try or what could be going wrong here?\nI have previously thought about it being a Logic Board issue and this seems to be agreed by first answer I got. Are there any steps I can take to isolate whether or not it is the logic board? Is there any easy way to fix or replace it?\n\nA: I would respond with this as a comment but I don't have that option, assuming because my reputation hasn't yet reached 50.\nTo me this sounds like a couple of possibilities.  I don't see mention of whether or not the screen gets backlight, only that \"it doesn't turn on\", so I'm writing this assuming that the computer chimes but the screen remains black.  It's good that you've tried reseating the RAM however I would also try to isolate both DIMMs.  Remove one of the RAM DIMMs, try powering on the Mac.  Reinstall the removed DIMM and remove the other DIMM, try powering on the Mac.  Try installing the DIMM from slot 1 into slot 2 and vice versa.  See if there is any change in behavior after each of these changes.  If the issue persists with each change then RAM is unlikely to be the culprit.\nAssuming RAM isolation has no effect I would try resetting the PMU.  You didn't mention the exact model of your PowerBook G4 but this Apple KB article should help you identify the correct process for your computer.  PMU resets typically have results when the Mac simply isn't power on at all however I've seen them resolve \"no video\" issues as well in the past.\nIf both of these had no effect I would start looking at it as a hardware failure, with either the logic board or LCD/display assembly to blame.  You did mention that an external display had no video as well so I would lean towards a logic board failure.  I would find it odd that the failure occurred after reseating the RAM but it could be a coincidence.\nAlso, PowerPC based Macs (G3, G4, G5) typically will not boot from USB devices.  There ARE some methods for getting some specific models to do so however they often come with mostly mixed results.  Your best bet for installing 10.5 would be doing so from a firewire drive or from the install DVD.\nHope that helps!  Let us know if you have any luck with bringing it back to life!\n", "Q: WiFi problems with new MacBook Air 11\" I just bought a new Mac Book Air 11\", but it looks like it has a problem with WiFi. So, every 20-30 minutes I lose an internet connection. The WiFi signal strength is good and adapter doesn't disconnect from the router, but I can't open any web site and all my internet applications (Skype, Dropbox, etc.) goes offline.

I wonder aside from tapping the \"x\" next to the recommended word to ignore recommendation, what can I do on the keyboard to ignore it? \n\nA: This is a bit of a workaround, but what I always do is just delete the last letter and type it again. iOS recognizes this as an assertion that that's how you wanted to type the word, and won't give the suggestion again. \nAlso, if you type a word and it gets corrected, the erase it and type it again, it won't correct you twice. \nFinally, it seems that if you type a word that isn't in the dictionary and ignore or erase the correction, it won't offer that correction again in that text field. You can try this by just typing the same \"wrong\" word a few times and it will stop correcting you. \nIt's not exactly what you're asking for, but I find the autocorrect to be sufficiently intuitive for me. (As a matter if fact, I typed this on my iPhone with absolutely no regard for errors.)\n\nA: Sorry. There isn't really another way.\nHowever, you can manually add words or phrases into the dictionary\n\nGo to the Settings app, choose General, Keyboard. Scroll to the bottom and you will see Shortcuts. At the very bottom you will see the ability to create a new shortcut.\n\nWhen adding a word, you can add just the phrase and leave the shortcut blank if you just want to add it to the dictionary.\n\nA: I just learned that you don't have to be too accurate in hitting that x mark.

Applications, scripts or official Apple tricks are all appreciated if it works fine.\nThanks to Patrix and Lizzan. It is good to know this setting. I tried that solution and it works fine. But I want to (if it is possible) have a shortcut for each input, so I don't have to pay attention to which input source is selected. (If I have only 2 language concerned, it works perfect. But I use 3 input language.) However, that solution is good enough, I just want to know if there is a \"perfect\" solution.\n\nA: To get different shortcuts for each input source, save something like this as private.xml in KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n<item>\n<name>test</name>\n<identifier>private.test</identifier>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_ENGLISH</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F2, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_CHINESE_TRADITIONAL</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F3, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_FRENCH</autogen>\n</item>\n</root>\n\n⌥E would be KeyCode::E, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE.

With the MBP and a built-in keyboard, I can get to the Recovery without difficulty, using any of the specified methods.\nThe Mini has been entirely different, where the best I can do is a login screen that offers to reset the login password.  For this, I am using not only a Windows keyboard, but also where the keyboard is connected to a KVM switch (i.e., USB connection from the Mini to the switch, and then keyboard attached to the switch).\nAfter a bunch floundering, I found that at least with the Mini, timing is an issue. I had been pressing the specified keys as soon as I could after a restart during the startup chime.  However, if I wait 3 seconds until the chime is done, and then press keys, I can get the recovery console.\nI don't know if it's that the Mini is a little different than an MBP, my use of external keyboard through a KVM or a combination, but with the Mini, timing is significant, and it's necessary to wait until after the chime to press keys\n\nA: If all the above answers don't work for you.

On Windows, several PDF viewers have the ability to set the background color to another one, which doesn't modify the PDF file itself. You can just think that it adds a virtual color when a file is opened by those software. But when you open the same file by other softwares, it still has white background.\nI often need to read many articles (PDF format) a day, and white background make my eyes feel uncomfortable.\nDoes Preview have the same feature? Or any plugin to do this?\n\nA: I just found a really cool inverted pdf app on github: https://github.com/eleloya/NightPDF\nPreview:\nAs the repo now is read only, I did some changes in a forked repo.\n\n*\n\n*Change default color\n\n*Change the deault window size to (1000, 1300)\n\n*Add close window shortcut (CMD + W)\n\nYou can download it here:\nhttps://github.com/yueyericardo/NightPDF/releases/tag/v0.2.1.5\n\n\nA: You can change the background color in Skim (a popular and lightweight app for viewing, highlighting, annotating, and editing PDFs). Open up your document in Skim, navigate to the Settings either from the menu bar (Skim -> Settings) or by pressing CMD + .. In the settings there is a tab called Display, make sure that Invert colors in Dark Mode is selected. Now, whenever macOS is in dark mode, Skim displays its UI and the PDF itself in dark colours.\n\n\nA: Skim now (as of version 1.6.6) has a dark mode option!\nSee the preferences for the option to invert colors.\n\nA: A simple workaround to change the background color in Skim is to (ab)use the reading bar preferences:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Preferences/Display in the app\n\n*Find the reading bar preferences\n\n*Select the desired color and opacity (50-80% depending on the color)\n\n*Tick the Invert Bar box\n\n\nAll this does is add a layer of color over the top of the pdf. So adjusting the opacity is the key. At 100% the document is completely hidden; at 30% the trick has little effect. Here's an example that gives Skim a solarized feel (Hex color = #B68A00, opacity = 50%).\n\nIf you never use the reading bar for its intended purpose, this workaround won't interfere with your usual use of the app. Two advantages of this approach are\n\n*\n\n*Easy to toggle on/off using cmd + shift + b\n\n*Fast to change the color from a \"dark mode\" to a \"light mode\" and back\n\nOne word of caution: Inverting the reading bar makes the whole document your desired color and the reading bar an awful glaring white. It's advisable to minimize the size (height) of the reading bar and tuck it somewhere out of the way. Here's an example in \"dark mode\" (Hex color = #002B37, opacity = 75%).\n\n\nA: Here's what I do, no coding, no plug in.\nClick on tools, select annotation, then mask.\nYou should see a grey frame now. Adjust the size of the frame to let the gray area cover the whole page. You do have to repeat this step for each page in the document.\n\nA: So Preview does not have this feature, but more on that in a moment.\nAdobe Reader for Mac does support this. Once you install the 400MB app, you can change the background colour in Preferences (⌘ cmd + ,) > * Accessibility** . Check Replace Document Colours, and set the right colours you want.\n\nSidenote: f.lux\nI would strongly recommend you take a look at f.lux, especially if you would like your computer to be as eye-friendly as possible (which, by the nature of the question, seems likely).\n\nf.lux makes your computer screen look like the room you're in, all the time.

I'm wondering if there's a way to bring focus to a process that's in \"activity monitor\".\nSpecifically, I've got a bunch of Google Chrome processes and I'm trying to figure out which process correlates to a particular browser/tab.\n\n\nA: Not really. The thing is, most of the time, processes in Activity Monitor don't actually have a UI that you can 'switch' to. Using the Google Chrome example, think of those 'Google Chrome Renderer' processes as background tasks, and you just see the result of them in the main 'Google Chrome' process. Activity Manager does not have a way to identify how to tie these 'background tasks' to the parent GUI.\nHowever, for your particular problem, Google Chrome actually provides you with a Task Manager that will help you out:\n\nIn many ways, the task manager is like a hospital monitor: you can use it to track the performance of its internal processes. If the browser seems to be sluggish, open the task manager to find details about each active process and close the one that seems to be using up a lot of resources.\n\n\nYou can use this to identify which tab is using up too many system resources. You can also use the Process ID from the Chrome Task Manager to match the process up in Activity Monitor (Process ID == PID).\n\nA: No - Activity Monitor merely shows you which processes have the ability to draw directly to the screen with an icon next to the name.\nIn your example, pid 464 is one such process that draws Chrome's output to the screen. You will need to mentally map that icon and perhaps use the task switcher key shortcut: CommandTab to switch the keyboard and pointer focus to that process.\nThe rest of the Renderer processes from your example are background processes that don't interact with the visual display directly and instead read or write data for another process to consume and display.

For example, Windows (as well as iPartition and other applications), by default display base-2 units.  Mac OS X (Disk Utility, diskutil, etc) usually defaults to base-10 kilobyte megabyte and terrabyte units rather than using base-2 versions.  That is, it will use KB10 rather than KB (or kb rather than KiB if using IEC unit names).\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte\n", "Q: How to save AppleScript Editor Documents?

I know it can be done when using Apple TV 2/3 but can't seem to find a way to do it in iTunes itself. I can tag the media files using MetaX or MetaZ, these tags show up in iTunes but I can't seem to limit playback of films to only 'U' for example. Anyone got any ideas?\n\nA: This used to be possible, but with the latest iteration of iTunes, it doesn't work.\nThe method was always as described above, and the same thing happened on the last major release of iTunes.  Apple eventually seemed to put things right, but it's happened again this time round.\nI have movies stored on my Mac and Home share them via iTunes.

Now they're all accessible.\nPerhaps Apple will resolve this issue too, if enough of us report it.\n\nA: If the content was purchased from the iTunes Store, you can enable Parental Controls. See HT1904 iTunes: Using Parental Controls : \n\n  \n*\n  \n*From the iTunes menu open Preferences ⌘ cmd ,\n  \n*Click the Parental tab.\n  \n*Select the checkbox next to any item you wish to disable or restrict.\n  \n\nContent not purchased from iTunes Store\nWhen you purchase content from the iTunes Store it sets the MPAA content rating for that item. Unfortunately, you cannot modify (or set) the content rating from within iTunes itself, so you're going to have to get a little bit creative.\nYou can edit the metadata using an app such as iFlicks, which I strongly recommend. iDentify is a free alternate, however it does not appear as nice (although I have not used it myself). I'm going to provide instructions for iFlicks, but the process would be very similar for iDentify.\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the movie out of iTunes onto your Desktop, and delete the movie from within iTunes.\n\n*Drag the movie into iFlicks. iFlicks should recognise the movie and match it up with the right information. \n\n*Select the movie, and then click the cog in the bottom menu bar (it's the third from the left)\n\n*In the popover you can set the Content rating on the lower right, then hit OK.\n\n*Choose iTunes compatible as the preset, Current Location as the destination.

It can take a while to find an AP that is working if the list is long. You can reduce delays by making it smarter. For example, you could check using the airport tool for a list of available APs and then pick one to connect to. \n", "Q: Sort Finder columns reversed I can't get this reversed thing to work:\nTell application \"Finder\" to set the sort direction of the modification date column to reversed\n\n\nA: There is a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 where changing the sort direction doesn't always work unless you change the sort column first (see this question).\ntell application \"Finder\" to tell list view options of window 1\n    set sort column to name column\n    set sort column to modification date column\n    set sort direction of column modification date column to reversed\nend tell\n\n\nA: There are some useful links in the answers to this question.

The iMac's display is too shiny and it gives me headaches when I work while the sun is shining. \nHow can I turn off the iMac's screen so it won't stress my graphic card, display etc.?\n\nA: I succeeded by using switchresx.\nTerminal command\nbrew cask install switchresx\n\nthen, open System Preferences, SwitchResX\nClick icon, setup a display set with a disabled primary display, setup hotkey (ctrl-opt-f1 for me), save&close SwitchResX\nThen, if you want to use single external display mode, press the hotkey et voilà\n\nA: Old school solution: Buy a yard of light-blocking fabric at your local fabric store. Hang it over the monitor (or tape it at the top of the screen if you're concerned about heat buildup.) This at least gets the job done. (Note: Make sure you turn on screen mirroring in Display Preferences so you don't lose your mouse pointer off the edge of the screen you're using.)\n\nA: i have the same problem, i don't know how its not possible to turn off the iMac monitor while still keeping on the external display. i got both apps, shades and slider, use them together and it goes completely black, i guess this will have to do for now. \ni used the shades app first to lower the brightness to about 15-20 percent. then on the external monitor i used to the slider app icon on top of the screen to lower the iMac monitor the rest of the way to pitch black. \n\nA: Your problem actually exists whether the iMac is on or off.  \nThe glare from sun (or other light sources) will not go away when you turn off your iMac, since the glass will still reflect the external light source.  I find it to be worse when the power is off. \nYou'll need to focus on old world solutions: fabric draping, turning the angle of the iMac to some degree that reflects the light away from you (remember angle of incidence equals angle of reflection) .\n-or-\nYou can purchase an antiglare film to the iMac.

It made the computer useful.  It was not the LCD itself that caused the worst glare reflection, it was the glass window in front.  I can be removed.\nOnce removed, the computer does not look so good. You can buy a panel without the glass (maybe still available) or you can cover up the edges with tape. My solution did not look good, but the screen did and made the computer quite usable.

I have a 30pin dock clock radio I used with my 3GS with corresponding dock adapter. I just upgraded to a 4 (I know, I know- in the past right?). However, I am insistent on keeping my iPhone 4 in a case. As a consequence, it will not fit into the dock with a dock adapter. \nIs the adapter essential? I haven't bothered using on with my iPod touch as it is light, but the iPhone is heavier. It stays upright and I imagine it would be okay, but do you think it would damage the phones dock over time?

I am staying at a hotel, and for some reason, I think they limit each Wifi connection to 95 kbyte / s.  So that is roughly 1.2 Mbps... and since I have 18 Mbps at home, I am using a speed that is less than 1/10 of the speed at home.\nSo I asked at the front desk to see if they have a room with a wired connection, and the answer is yes, and I switched to this room, and even bought a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter for the Macbook Air to be able to use the Ethernet wired connection.\nBut to my surprise, the speed of that connection is just the same: 95 kbyte / s.  Is there an easy way to tell OS X to automatically use both connections so that the speed can be doubled?\nFor example, if one tab in Chrome uses one connection and the downloading file in Chrome uses another connection.  Or if Chrome uses one connection and Firefox uses another one, that might work too.  Or can the OS be smart and just \"merge\" the 2 connections transparently?\n(or if the OS \"randomly\" uses one or the other connection each time a connection is made, then the effect is roughly achieved too).\n\nA: If you are using VMWare or Parallels you can connect a virtual machine directly to one specific network interface (WiFi in the example)\n\nand use the other interface as the default for OS X:\n\nIn the specific situation described in the question it may be too much of a hassle though.\n\nA: From Super User: If I have two internet connections on osx, how can I use both to increase my bandwidth?:\n\nShort answer: no. With 2 links, you have 2 IP addresses. It can be done with some specific higher end NICs (e.g. Intel quad cards), but they will appear to the rest of the network as a single IP address in that mode. If the assumption is that you have 2 distinct IP addresses, it cannot be done\n\n\nA: Having two or more functional network devices in a computer each with its own IP address is perfectly acceptable, and is how many servers work. The issue for a desktop or laptop is telling software to use one and not the other when the app isn't designed to do so. You can't combine two IP addresses together to make one without special driver software — some modems used to be able to \"shotgun\" two devices together to overcome V.90 speeds, but this wasn't widespread. \nA theoretical solution would be to setup an SSH server using one of the connections (I suspect SSH will be fine with letting you define it should use eth0, for example). You could then connect to this server from your \"main\" Wi-Fi connection and ask it for port forward, so that one particular port (or a range of them) are channelled through the SSH server on the Ethernet connection.\nYou could port forward BitTorrent traffic, for example, and use your \"main\" connection for everything else. \nUnfortunately I don't know enough about SSH to find out how this might be done and haven't the time to research, but a quick browse of the man pages might help you out. \n\nA: ssh tunnels are truly the swiss army knife of networking.\nIf you can set up an ssh tunnel back to your home network, you can enable compression on the tunnel. That means that all the data over the tunnel will be compressed at one end and decompressed at the other end. Your apparent network bandwidth will be somewhat larger, though the CPU load on both your laptop and the machine in your home network will be larger too.\nYou'll use a command line like this...\nssh -p 45678 -D 3333 -C userid@host\n\nYour home gateway needs to accept connections on some 45678 or some other port. Don't use the standard port of 22, since there are machines out on the internet that scan blocks of ip addresses attempting to connect to port 22 and trying large numbers of dictionary passwords. SSH should be secure, but why risk it by advertising yourself.\nConfigure your home gateway to forward connections on the ssh port # - say 45678 - to your host machine inside your home network at port 22. You also need to know your home ip address, or register with a service like dynamic dns.\nYour ssh server is then running on the host machine within your home network.\nThe option -D 3333 tells ssh to run a SOCKS proxy for you at localhost:3333. For Safari go into your network settings->advanced->proxies and enable the SOCKS proxy for localhost 3333. For Firefox or Chrome you can do this in the browser's settings. The SOCKS proxy will automatically forward everything to your host back home, then out to the internet from there.\nNow, everything you do in your browser will first be compressed, sent over the slow internet back to your home, then decompressed and sent out to the internet as appropriate using your fast home connection. All the traffic back will come to your home via fast internet, get compressed, forwarded to you over the slow connection, decompressed, and sent to your web browser.\nAs an added bonus, Netflix and other services will think you are in your house and you'll get all the services you would get at home.\n\nA: You can not use only a Mac, you need an additional special router to access more than one Internet connection. \nFor example this machine can bound any type Internet connection and route it to you. A detailed image how this works, can be found on the \"Features\" tab on the product page.\n", "Q: Can Time Machine be setup to back up only one folder?

I know this to be true because I've touched the black screen randomly (Well, I remember the position of my homescreen apps), turned on apps, and heard sounds from the app. I just can't see anything.\nJust to be clear, \n\n\n*\n\n*I only have 1 PC desktop computer with Windows XP installed. \n\n*I like to think I know a lil' bit more on computers than the average person but that's about it. Please no advanced techie-talk.\n\n*My iPad has ios version 5.x. Uh... the one before Google Maps was removed. It's the 64Gb with 3g version.\n\n*I regret not enabling Apple's syncing thing before it broke. Apple icloud? Think would've stored my app data.\n\n\nWhat is the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*My main problem is, how do I take out the many files I have on that iPad 1?\nThe files I'm most interested in rescuing include\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's photo app pics\n\n*\n\n*Photos I've taken with camera and inserted\n\n*The pictures I've edited with some Adobe app\n\n*The screenshots I've taken\n\n\n*App data\n\n*\n\n*Paper by Fiftythree - I created some nice illustrations with this app but don't know how to get it out\n\n*Browser bookmarks - Not a big deal but if possible.\n\n*Basically, any other app data. I can't remember them all and what I've had.\n\n\n\n*What can I realistically do to fix my iPad screen?\nSorry, it's my first Apple product, so I don't know what can be done if anything. I guess what are my options? If my iPad screen can't be fixed, what can I do with it besides throwing it in the trash? By which I mean is there something cool I don't know about? Just wondering.\nJust to reiterate, my more urgent question is number 1: saving my files.\nWhat have I found + tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've connected my iPad, gone to iTunes, and noticed a tab where I can download and upload app files. I was able to extract my writing notes from the \"ia writer\" app. However, all other apps like the one from Adobe aren't there.\n\n*I thought I could still use my ipad by pretending to be blind and using voice command (I think they call it that) but don't know if can turn on the accessibility features with my current situation or know how to use it.\n\n*I wondered how to turn on the icloud thing even with the black screen -- assuming Apple's icloud will back up my data through the Internet. If the icloud thing is the best solution, I won't complain too much that I have to get another ipad to rescue my files.\n\n*Found I can still update the iPad's ios via iTunes. Would that help? Fear that since can't see the screen, the update might show some confirmation button and won't progress with install, making matters even worse.\n\n\nHow do I feel:\nGuess it doesn't matter but aside from feeling down my iPad doesn't work, I can't at least take my files with me. In a way, my files are more important, especially my illustrations from the Paper app and the photos I took.\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect the device to iTunes and force a backup using the menu command.\n\n*Restore that backup to another device and carry on with getting the files off.\n\n\nYou should be able to borrow someone's iPad for little expense (a few beers or buy them a Pizza) and then wipe your data once you're convinced you've exported all the data you care onto the computer or wherever it's going to live.\n\nA: Either go and see a genius to see if they have some magic they can use, like special hardware, or jailbreak it using a tethered jail break and see if that lets you SSH into it or something. SSH includes SFTP, so you'll be able to connect to it and explore its contents with most standard FTP clients. \n", "Q: Apple Mail vs Thunderbird performance I'm running Apple Mail 5.3 and Thunderbird 17.0.4 on Mac OS Lion 10.7.5. The system I'm running those apps it's an iMac with 3Gb of RAM and 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.\nI run both applications at the same time and I got those results looking with the Activity Monitor.\n\nAs you can see, Apple Mails consumes a little bit less than Thunderbird but uses more virtual memory.\nMy question is, which one has better performance? Apple Mail or Thunderbird? I ask this because that was a puntual test, and I don't know if they get stressed when looking for RSS feeds or email on the inbox.\nDo you know any other mail app which works better looking on the performance?\n\nA: usualy mail applications all lay around the same in preformance and memory depending on size of inbox, file sizes, nr of RSS's there are many variables, but the general thing is they only use enough to have an impact on performance, whenever they are grabbing new information! (not even then) but in order to minimize CPU usage you should set \"grab mail\" too manual\nas far as tip on good mail client.. check out sparrow!\n\nA: In general, Apple Mail should perform better than Thunderbird. This is for a few reasons. Apple Mail is built using Apple's current development platform, Cocoa. Cocoa allows for access to more recent, native APIs on the Mac: things such as OpenCL, Grand Central and Core Animation. It is also programmed natively in 64-bit mode. And lastly, Thunderbird is no longer being developed and has an older code-base.\nWhat this means to you is that Apple Mail can take advantage of the built-in hardware, allowing software to do less of the number crunching, and giving you better overall performance. It will also allow you to use more memory (though it is unlikely any Mail program will regularly need more than 3.5GB of memory).\nThis explanation does not take into account any additional tasks one mail program may do over another, such as using a plug-in for Apple Mail.\n", "Q: Using the same iTunes library with two different versions of iTunes I would like to use my iTunes library on two different computers, whose OS versions are different and would like to know to which extent it is possible to use the same iTunes library on two different versions of iTunes.\nMore precisely, here is my situation : \n\n\n*\n\n*On my Mac #1, the OS is 10.6.8 with iTunes 10.6 (40)\n\n*On my Max #2, the OS is 10.5.8 with iTunes 10.6.3 (25)\n\n\nCurrently, I am able to use both iTunes with the same library.\nI would like to know if I can install on Mac #1 the last version of iTunes (namely, iTunes 11) and still be able to open/play/edit my music on Mac #2.\n\nA: Sharing a physical library between iTunes instances won't work due to various reasons (e.g. incompatible library formats, conflicting access) but you won't need to do that. Home Sharing in included iTunes for exactly this reason and allows you to access the library of Mac #1 from Mac #2 (or vice versa, depending on where your library is actually stored).\nThere are actually two options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes Preferences on the Mac were the library is stored, go to Sharing and make your library available to the local network. You should now see the library in the sidebar of the other Mac\n\n*Create an Apple ID if you don't have one already and use it to enable Home Sharing via File > Devices > \"Turn On Home Sharing\" on all involved computers. The benefit of this approach is that it also works with iOS devices and Apple TV. For details see Understanding home sharing and Setting up Home Sharing on your computer.\n", "Q: How to clear iPhone's concact cache for text messages? My iPhone (model 5, IOS 6.1.2) seems to have some sort of contact cache which it uses when sending text messages: whenever I am sending a message to someone, I start typing the persone's name in te \"to:\" field, and the iPhone shows me all the contacts matching the letters I typed; but it shows up also contacts I have deleted long ago, and which I don't want around anymore.\nHow can I get rid of this?\nIs this related to the infamous e-mail cache?\n\nA: This has been FINALLY fixed in IOS 7. Now you can remove contacts from this cache.\nAs soon as the unwanted contact pops up while you're typing in the \"to:\" field, you can tap on a little \"i\" (probably for \"info\") icon on its right, and have a menu appear where you can remove the contact, or add it back to your address book if you feel so inclined.\n\nA: In iOS 9, go to Contacts and start typing the contact name of phone number. The cached contact will appear after any actual matching contacts. Touch the cached contact, then Edit, and then Delete Contact.\n\nA: I have an iPhone 6\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Message screen (where you text from)  \n\n*Click on the edit \"icon\" (upper right) Like you're going to start a new text  \n\n*Enter a contact that has multiple people   \n\n*Go to the multiple contact you want to get rid of and click on the little \"i\" with the circle around it\n\n*Click \"Remove\" A message will come up \"Are you sure you want to remove this recent group?\"\n\n*Click \"Remove from recents\" or \"Cancel\" to not remove it\n\n*Repeat for other multiple contacts you want to get rid of\n\n\nA: The one cached address that had multiple contacts did not show the little circle - I have used that before. So I deleted the conversation and lo and behold, that long list of contacts vanished!!\n\nA: Apparently you have to reset everything. It'll make the phone a \"new phone\", but I don't know exactly what will happen. I want to do it as well, because I have contacts that I want to just go away; but I'm nervous. I don't want to get rid of all of the contacts! Other than this, I don't know what there is. :/ I'm sorry. \n\nA: This is an issue I have contended with for quite some time. I first noticed it with the iOS 6 rollout for iPhone 5. I have contacted Apple a number of times. The only way to clear the cache is a drastic, annoying total restore from new. I've posted to the Apple communities about the issue, but Apple deletes the postings saying that comments for future updates do not belong in the Apple Support Communities.\n", "Q: USB flash drive not shown My macbook suddenly stopped showing USB flash drives in Finder when I plug them in.\nI tried 3 different USB sticks - none work (worked just fine yesterday).\nUSB-ports work fine - I tested all three with an iPhone, iPad, my Nike+ device, even my usb-modem stick - everything works just fine. Except for the USB-storage devices...\nThe USB drives do not show up in the Disk Utility. The USB drives do not show up in the \"System Report\" (known as \"System Profiler\" in earlier versions of OSX). 1 times out of 10 they do show up as some weird \"Composite device\" there, but do not work.\nI have Mac OS 10.7.5. I tried resetting  NVRAM / PRAM - didn't help.\nPS. the weird thing is that the drives do not show up under Boot Camp as well, when I'm on windows. So it's not just some drivers problem, but maybe firmware fault? My guess is - my Mac does not supply enough power to the USB ports when a USB drive is inserted? It's a hardware problem since the ports work fine with all other \"non storage\" devices.\n\nA: When \"System Report\" aka \"System Profiler\" does not list your USB devices, and Windows running from Boot Camp also does not list your USB devices and no power is supplied by your USB devices it is very likely that this is not a software issue.\nAnother way to see your connected USB devices with detailed information is to run\nsystem_profiler SPUSBDataType\n\nIf the above fails and gives no satisfied output, it is very, very likely some of your internal hardware components are broken or disconnected.\nWhen there are no problems with your other IO devices (e.g. firewire) it might be an internal cable that came lose, else I would suggest your south bridge is broken.\nIf you still think the power is the problem, try to use a powered-USB hub that will provide the juice needed for your peripherals. Or you can try to plug-in a low power consuming device like a USB mouse.\n", "Q: How do I get com.apple.servermgrd to use a non-self-signed SSL certificate? I have received a valid SSL certificate for my Mountain Lion Server (10.8.2 Build 12C3104) and have installed that cert for use by all services (and SSL and other services do not pop up the \"Verify Certificate\" dialog - only Server seems to be still using a self-signed cert. \nEach time I connect remotely using Server App 2.2.1 (169) as follows:\n\nDid I miss a step where I need to install a different cert for com.apple.servermgrd to use or do I need a second configuration step past making the current certificate selected in Server app and rebooting the server? I'd rather use a valid certificate to authenticate rather than have to \"always trust\" this self-signed cert when connecting to manage my server.\n\nA: Apple KB article HT3930 explains how to configure SSL for servermgrd, the Server Admin web interface.\nIt applies to Mac OS X Server 10.6 so until Apple updates this article part of the steps are confusing / obsolete. \nLuckily, on Mountain Lion Server (10.8) servermgrd's certificate is stored in the same location as on Mac OS X Server Snow Leopard: in the System keychain of Aplications>Utilities>Keychain Access. \nHere is what is needed on Mountain Lion (taken from the article)\n\n  \n*\n  \n*While logged into the OS X where Server is set up to run services, open Keychain Access.\n  \n*Select the System keychain.\n  \n*Double click the com.apple.servermgrd identity preference (credit: picture borrowed from here):\n\n  \n*Select your valid SSL certificate. You will have to import your SSL certificate first as explained in KB article PH7297.\n  \n*Authenticate as an administrator if prompted.\n  \n*As root, restart servermgrd for the changes in Keychain Access to take effect with this Terminal command:  sudo killall servermgrd\n  (authenticate with your administrator password if prompted).\n  \n\n\nA: I have confirmed this technique also works for a Mac running OS X 10.9.0 Mavericks with Server app version 3.0.1 (after renewing an SSL fallback certificate which renewal process was self-signed, I had to toggle it to a valid certificate signed by a trusted CA). \nFrom another (administrative Mac) on the same subnet which is running OS X 10.9.1, I can launch Server app 3.0.2, then select \"Other Mac\", then select the Mac mentioned above as the target Mac to log into and administrate. Doing so works fine (the certificate is trusted and there is no alert panel generated warning about distrusting com.apple.servermgrd etc.).  \n\nA: One thing to check, if jaume's procedure is still not working for you. Look at the access control list for the identity certificate that you want servermgrd to use. Make sure that the servermgrd binary is on the list.\nIn later versions, the process listening on port 311 is called servermgr-listener so you may need to add that binary to the ACL as well.\nand also change your killall command to:\nsudo killall servermgr-listener\n\n\nA: So for all the folks that are dealing with the issue of macOS Server application not respecting the change when you add your 3rd party SSL cert in order to avoid the tiresome pop-up on every App launch, I think I found the issue while searching for the answer to an unrelated problem (or so I thought).\nIf you follow the steps in this page, it fixes the issue. Even though servermgrd is already listed as an allowed app.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203731\nThanks,\nDavid\n", "Q: How to protect my Mac from reseting the admin password Yesterday I was studying and writing some texts in german. I closed my MBP and went watch some TV which made me forget about the german keyboard layout.\nWhen I came back, my password wasn't being accepted at all. I double checked both shifts, caps lock, everything. (The keyboard layout wasn't being shown at the top)\nI gave up and started looking online on ways to reset my password. I found out that anyone in possession of my Mac is able to easily reset my admin password even without knowing anything about me or my computer.\nIs there a way to protect myself from this kind of \"attack\"?\nReference: Recover Admin password\n\nA: FileVault crypts all data on the boot volume. Someone with a physical access to your Mac can boot from the recovery partition but has no easy access to your private data.\nThe drawback is that even you can't recover your data if you loose your credentials.\nAnother option is to set a firmware password. This doesn't encrypt the hard drive, but prevents users from booting into a special mode that can be used to reset or bypass a password (typically Single-User, Recovery, or Target Disk mode).\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup FileVault\n\n*Setup Firmware Password\n", "Q: Sound Output from GarageBand (on iPad) using Bluetooth Is it possible to use bluetooth to listen to the sounds of GarageBand on iPad?

I just don't understand how it would get bricked sitting on a desk, no jailbreak etc.\n\nA: Error 3194 is related to a network connectivity issue. Typically security software or a firewall is blocking access to Apple's servers: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3694#error3194. You can also try connecting to iTunes on someone else's computer (preferably at another physical location as well).\nAs far as the screen suddenly not working, while not typical it certainly happens. The iPhone is a piece of hardware made from electrical components. Every electrical component made is prone to failure for various reasons. If you can't get it working after a restore, I would highly recommend making a Genius Bar appointment at your local Apple Store.\n", "Q: Adding a playlist to a cleared iTunes library, to be synced to half-full iPod my Apple-curious father has come up with a novel question - I was wondering if anyone had advice as how to solve?\nBeing fond of a certain type of music, he's gradually filled up his iPod with his music collection. As everything he owns has been transferred, he's blanked his iTunes account and no longer updates his iPod. All his music is in one place, for easy, portable, listening.\nProblem is, now he has to add more - a playlist for an event he is DJ'ing at (no, really).\nAdding this playlist to his blank iTunes account, and then syncing to the iPod would erase his music library stored on that iPod, would it not?\nSorry if there's an obvious answer to this - particularly if the answer is to sync the iPod back to iTunes to fill up his account, then add the extra tracks and move everything back to the iPod. That was my suggestion - wanted to double-check in case his beloved tracks are lost forever...\n\nA: I never ever recommend using an iPod as the only form of storage for music. Inevitably that iPod will become lost, stolen or dead, and his music will be gone forever.\nThat said, there are two suggestions for what you asked. The first is to place the iPod into \"manually manage\" mode. This kbase article from Apple is a good guide that covers the different methods for different generations of products.\nThe second, recommended suggestion is similar to what you mention in the question. First move the music back to a computer. You will need special software to do this, such as the cross-platform CopyToy. Once the music is back in iTunes on the computer, create this new list and sync ALL of the music over. The iPod will be wiped of all of its music and replaced with the same songs, plus the new playlist. And while he's at it, have him backup his iTunes Library so he doesn't lose his music.\n", "Q: How to change default cell formats in Excel 2011?

The problem is, whenever I open a new doc, all my custom styles are reset and the extraneous defaults I deleted have returned.\nIs there a way to permanently change these default styles? I want the changes to persist both for new docs I create, and when opening docs someone else has created. Google has proved fruitless for me, but my search-fu is not the strongest.\nPS (Though I would prefer to, please no comments about switching to Numbers. Already had that conversation with the boss.)\n\nA: For existing (or the one you get from others) Excel documents where you have a lots of data in it, try using the down arrow (under the format window).\nIt will open new window where you can choose a new format there. \nNext right click on the cells you want to modify, or just create new cells.\nAnother way for existing documents you get from others do following:\nOpen and than click on the \"Import Cell styles\" than select your format file (both files have to be open at same time).\nFor new documents use your saved template.\nPS. One day you will succeed giving your template to your coworkers and teaching them to use it, so you do not have to reformat theirs.\nHere is my screen capture showing the original and SAMPLE after modifying.\nHope this helped, and you can impress your boss with your excel skills.\n\n\n\nA: Your best bet would be to create an Excel Template that has all of the formatting options that you like, then just create new workbooks utilizing that template. \nOpen a new workbook, or one that has all of the formatting you prefer (remove all data from it though so its clean every time you open it), set all your formats and general preferences, then Save As and save it as an Excel Template.  \n", "Q: Is it possible to download data from a lost iPod?

The real thanks go to Leo Shidai Liu, the author of xclip.el.\n\n\nA: Add this to ~/.emacs:\n(defun pbcopy ()\n  (interactive)\n  (call-process-region (point) (mark) \"pbcopy\")\n  (setq deactivate-mark t))\n\n(defun pbpaste ()\n  (interactive)\n  (call-process-region (point) (if mark-active (mark) (point)) \"pbpaste\" t t))\n\n(defun pbcut ()\n  (interactive)\n  (pbcopy)\n  (delete-region (region-beginning) (region-end)))\n\n(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c c\") 'pbcopy)\n(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c v\") 'pbpaste)\n(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c x\") 'pbcut)\n\nIf you use Emacs in iTerm 2, you can also remap key combinations in the preferences:\n\nThen add something like this to ~/.emacs:\n(global-set-key (kbd \"<f13> c\") 'pbcopy)\n(global-set-key (kbd \"<f13> v\") 'pbpaste)\n(global-set-key (kbd \"<f13> x\") 'pbcut)\n\n\nA: The following just works, got it from here :)\n(defun copy-from-osx ()\n  (shell-command-to-string \"pbpaste\"))\n\n(defun paste-to-osx (text &optional push)\n  (let ((process-connection-type nil))\n    (let ((proc (start-process \"pbcopy\" \"*Messages*\" \"pbcopy\")))\n      (process-send-string proc text)\n      (process-send-eof proc))))\n\n(setq interprogram-cut-function 'paste-to-osx)\n(setq interprogram-paste-function 'copy-from-osx))\n\n\nA: The version of emacs that is included with OS X is too old to provide this functionality.\nFortunately you can update emacs to a version that is integrated with your clipboard here: http://emacsformacosx.com\nI believe that you use Ctrl+Y to paste in emacs, after the update.\n\nA: I found this post really useful (defining 2 functions and assigning shortcuts to them in your ~/.emacs file).\nAfter adding those lines to your .emacs file, you won't have access to those shortcuts until you open a new shell session (tab/window). Let the changes be applied.\n\nA: You can get such interaction with the clipboard transparently while running Emacs in the text terminal by enabling the xclip-mode provided by the xclip package which you can install from GNU ELPA (i.e. via M-x package-list-packages RET).\nSee also https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10900/ for a similar question&answers.\n", "Q: Can't play an Online game that requires Java Some games online require Java to play, however it says that I have a missing plug-in. I am worried that I might get the java-exploit if I downloaded Java, any advice ?\n\nA: Apple is automatically disabling old versions of Java for security reasons. If you re-install Java you do certainly run a slight risk of exposing your computer to known \"in-the-wild\" exploits. This is a decision you are best suited to make. Are the games worth installing Java for? Are there alternate places to play the same games without using Java?\nIf you need to install Java, follow this link to get the latest version.\n\nA: I would agree with \"stay away from Java\", but !\nHere is an example why: \nFebruary 19, 2013, 3:52PM\nApple Breached by Facebook Hackers Using Java Exploit\nhttp://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/apple-breached-facebook-hackers-using-java-exploit-021913\nJava is great software (and I know how much one likes to play online games) but unfortunately as you can see it can be used by crooks.\nYou can get some protection by disabling it in the browser.\n\"If you need Java for specific Web sites, a better solution is to adopt a two-browser approach. If you normally browse the Web with Firefox, for example, consider disabling the Java plugin in Firefox, and then using an alternative browser (Chrome, IE9, Safari, etc.) with Java enabled to browse only the site(s) that require(s) it.\nWith that said, it is up to you.\n\nA: As soon as you have latest Java you're reasonably safe. Oracle doesn't provide free java for macOS after April 16, 2019. Currently most complete set of Java binaries provided by Azul. It has binaries for Apple Silicon.\n", "Q: Is there a speed difference between copying files at the same time or after one another We got a new Mac Pro server and I am faced with cloning 4TB of data from one, to the other via. Firewire 800 cable and Target Disk Mode. Oh for Thunderbolt. \nIs there an impact on the total speed of copying if you clone two hard disks simultaneously vs. cloning one hard disk, waiting for it to finish and then copying the next. \ni.e. is\nTotal Time for: (old)Disk 1 -> (new)Disk 1 at the same time as (old)Disk 2 -> (new) Disk 2 \n\nFaster, slower or the same as:\nTotal Time for: (old)Disk 1 -> (new)Disk 1 \nTHEN (old) Disk 2 -> (new) Disk 2. \n\nAlthough this question would be appropriate for SuperUser, I'm asking specifically for our Mac environment. I think this is the type of thing that varies by operating system, and I'm not interested in the implications which are OS dependent (plus, I feel like this is my community, not SU).  \n\nA: There should be no difference. FireWire 800 operates on the physical layer, so it is all just bits of data as far as it is concerned. I recommend moving them both simultaneously, so you don't have to remember to come back and set the second one up to clone after the first is completed.\nHow many drives are you cloning? Personally, I recommend installing the drives from the old Mac Pro temporarily into the extra slots of the new Mac Pro and cloning them all within the new Mac Pro's box. That way you will benefit from internal SATA's 3Gb/s speeds, which are much faster than FW800.\n", "Q: BootCamp partition disappeared Running Macbook Pro with snow leopard, I partitioned with bootcamp assistant to install dual boot between MacOS and windows 7. However, now it shows that my Mac Hard Disk is 499 GB, but available only 303 GB, but the partition of 100GB that I made for win7 doesnt show up anywhere.\nWhere should I look for the missing partition?\n\nA: If you cannot find it in disk utility, then it probably has become empty space. Then all you have to do is repartition (via disk utility) your OSX partition so it takes up the entire drive again. If that doesn't work, backup your system, and format the entire drive when reinstalling Snow Leopard, and restore afterwards.\n", "Q: Remote not working on new iMac My shiny new late 2012 iMac arrived, but I can't seem to get it to respond to my Apple Remote. \nI tried searching the System Preferences to see if out if the box it was paired to another remote, but I can't find that option any more. \nI love using my Remote with iTunes and Plex. What can I do?\n\nA: The new iMac does not have an infrared receiver. You will not be able to use your Apple Remote. For controlling iTunes, I recommend Remote from the App Store. For Plex, I recommend Plex from the App Store.\nWhereas in the past Apple promoted the idea of using your Mac as a media hub (hence the inclusion of the Front Row app), I think Apple is now promoting the idea of using an Apple TV instead. It seems like every new hardware refresh is having the infrared capabilities removed.\n", "Q: Shortcut to install Applications? Sometimes when opening up a .dmg, the application is just sitting there itself, with no handy alias to /Applications. To copy it over, I need to open a new Finder window, switch to /Applications, and then drag and drop the app in. \nIs there an easier way? I would love it if there was a keyboard shortcut that would copy the selected app into /Applications. How can I make this work?\n\nA: The simplest way is to just use the ⌥⌘S shortcut to show the Finder sidebar (which has the Applications folder by default), and drag the app there. You can then use the same shortcut to hide it if you prefer.\nIf you wanted a unique shortcut for copying a file to the Applications folder, you could make a simple service using Automator:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator, and create a new workflow, as a Service.\n\n*Set the options to Service receives selected files or folders in Finder.\n\n*Add a Copy Finder Items action, and set the destination to the Applications folder.\n\n*Save the service, and give it an appropriate name.\n\n*Open Keyboard Preferences, select Services under Keyboard Shortcuts. Find the service you just created, and assign it a shortcut of your choice.\n\n\nIf you wanted to get fancy, you could expand the service to automatically eject the disk image afterwards, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.\n\nA: In (Mountain) Lion, there is a feature where you can add a folder shortcut to the Dock, and set various display/sorting options for it. I have shortcuts to Applications and my Downloads and Documents folders (among others), and when I get a .dmg file like you're describing I just drag the app file over the Applications folder in the Dock and drop it there.\n", "Q: Electricity coming through screws, USB, and headphone jack on 2009 MacBook I've seen some online threads and at least one StackExchange question on this, but the answers don't seem to apply to my situation.\nI have a 2009-vintage white 13\" MacBook that's always been in great shape except for needing the relatively common bottom case replacement a while back. I did the replacement myself without apparent incident.\nThereafter, though, I noticed that the exposed metal screws on the bottom of the case can burn/tingle my exposed skin if the machine is plugged in. And I do use the three-prong grounded (earthed) power cable.\nI actually first noticed this while charging my 2nd-generation iPod Touch from the USB port while the laptop was charging; the whole back of the iPod had a live feel to it -- a little stuttery resistance as you passed your finger over the metal, which went back to being perfectly smooth as soon as I unplugged it. And I also have a pair of earbuds with metal casings that are downright painful to wear when plugged in to the laptop.\nAll these things only happen when the laptop is plugged in. Remove it from \"mains power\", as the non-Americans would say, and all these effects cease immediately. Happens with two different power cables I've tried, and in all different locations. (Well, given that all those locations are homes and offices with standard U.S. wiring.)\nI've tried retightening the bottom case screws, but they're as tight as I can comfortably make them without worrying about stripping the head or the threads.\nSo -- anyone have any new insights on this one? Thanks!\n\nA: If you are using a grounded plug and feel ground loop current you should either have the outlet serviced or the computer serviced.\nIt's normal (and safe) for ground loop current to exist and feel lightly tingly on Macs with ungrounded power supplies since there are spinning fans - especially inside the thermoplastic white Macs. It's also almost inconceivable that the low current DC voltage that a Mac battery and power adapter provide could be a safety risk, but it could be a sign of internal damage and worth having an expert check out the wall socket and or the Mac plus it's power adapter.\nSince your comment reinforces the level of detail you are seeking, I would say that any Apple repair shop that received that Mac for repair might use a multimeter to see if they can sense an voltage on ground pins and/or the case. They might place a new DC in / magsafe board in and re-test to see if that's the cause. They would of course test with their adapter and then remove the components in the main unibody section to look for loose screws, scortch marks or other signs of burns or liquid damage to the components that might cause this abnormal current situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*battery\n\n*rear vent\n\n*fan\n\n*optical drive\n\n*logic board\n\n\nOnce you've gone over these - hopefully you can visually see the problem or remove whatever is grounding current / voltage to the frame.\n\nA: Electrical faults: If the cause is not obvious to you then take it to someone who will know how to find it - for a Mac, that is your nearest Apple repair place.\nPlease don't stick live, even slightly live, electricity in your ears!\n", "Q: Parental controls not logging off user We are successfully using Parental controls to limit our childrens time by the computer. \nHowever I can't seem to be able to make the system log off the user when the time limit runs out.

[allowing you to]:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Move & Zoom to Full Screen\n  \n*Move & Zoom to Left Half\n  \n*Move & Zoom to Right Half\n  \n*Move & Zoom to Top Half\n  \n*Move & Zoom to Bottom Half\n  \n*Revert to Original Dimensions\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts are also available and customisable:\n\nKeyboard mode allows you to do everything you can do in mouse mode, and more. It's all controlled by the Keyboard section of Moom's settings window.\nOnce set up, you can use the keyboard to zoom windows to full/half/quarter-screen sizes, move them (while optionally confining them to the display) around, send them to another display; grow and shrink them, center them, and revert them to their pre-Mooming dimensions.\nAfter pressing the keyboard mode trigger key you define, an onscreen overlay appears. While the overlay is visible, you can use easy-to-remember keys (e.g., the arrow keys, plus Return, Tab, and Space) to control the frontmost window, instead of having to memorize tons of outlandish key combos.\nIf you want a reminder as to your defined shortcuts, you can display a cheat sheet (enabled in Moom's Settings) along with the overlay:\n  \n\nSo essentially, yes, you can replicate the feature diretly, with the same keystroke, only with plenty more options.  Moom isn;t free, but it's not particularly expensive either.  Plenty more window managers are available that do similar, and even cost less.  This is just my recommendation.\n\nA: To emulate this from Windows, check out BetterTouchTool. \n\nA: I was directed here when asked the same question to google in 2020.\nThe solution in Catalina is to hold Option when hovering on the green windows button.\nYou'll be able to choose which half of the screen to bound the window.\n\n\nA: Spectacle (github, homepage) is free, and works fine for me.\n\nA: Divvy has a free trial, and is about $14 if you would like to get ride of a window that pops up and asks whether you want to buy the software. It allows you to customize different keyboard shortcuts to different window configurations.\n\nA: You could use one of these: BettersnapTool or BetterTouchTool or Hyperdock\n\nA: In 2021 you could use rectangle since spectacle is no longer actively maintained.\nFollow link for details, install with homebrew brew install --cask rectangle.\n", "Q: add a certain episode to Podcasts app I am using the Apple Podcasts app and I have setup iTunes to sync the last 10 unplayed episodes of each podcast feed to my iPhone 5.\nNow I found an old episode that I want to listen to but that one is not among those last 10. How can I keep my iTunes sync settings and still get that one particular episode onto my iPhone (preferably but not necessarily into the Podcasts app) for offline listening?\n\nA: (Assuming you have the latest iTunes version)\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't already have the desired episode in your computer's iTunes library, download it from the iTunes store.\n\n*Connect the iPhone (either via WiFi or USB cable) and go to the podcast in the iTunes library. Drag the episode toward the right side of the screen. A sidebar should pop up and your iPhone should be listed under Devices. Drop the episode onto your iPhone.\n\n*It'll begin syncing and the episode will be copied over.\nOnce you finish listening to it, it will be deleted from the iPhone the next time you sync because of your \"10 most recent unplayed\" settings. Depending on iTunes settings, it may or may not also be deleted from your computer's iTunes library.\n\nA: I can not tell you how to get older episodes into Apple’s podcast app via the graphical user interface (as I do use a different podcast app). However, I would like to offer a alternative solution that works for any podcatcher. Try Huffduffer (about).\nIn a nutshell: it gives you a personal podcast feed which you can fill with any audio you want. You might add a interesting single episode of a podcast you have not subscribed to, or an older episode of a podcast you have subscribed to. As long as the file is publicly accessible, you can add it to your Huffduffer feed. Look up filename of old episode you want, huffduff it, and download audio episode via your favorite podcast client.\nI am a happy user, and not affiliated with them.\n\nA: Here's how I understand your situation.  You listen to podcasts regularly on your phone, but would like to access them on your computer as well.  Additionally, you'd like your phone and computer to synchronize played episodes, downloaded episodes, settings, etc.  However, you'd like to be able to access old podcast episodes on your phone that might not have synchronized.\nAs I see it, here are your options.\nIf this is a rare occurrence and you have dropbox, this honestly might be simplest.\nDropbox Method\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Download the Podcast Episode\n\n*Drag the file from iTunes library to Dropbox\n\n*Open in Dropbox on iPhone\n\n\nIf this is happening often, you have a couple additional options.\nNon-Sync Method\nUse this method if you don't often listen on your computer, and can live without played podcasts being synchronized with iTunes.  This is what I do because I listen primarily through my phone.  It's simple, and works great.  In my opinion, the podcasts app for iOS works more efficiently as a standalone and gets wonky when you try to manage the synchronization with iTunes.  \nThe Advantage of this method is you can see old episodes directly on your device.  The tradeoff is you lose synching, which may or may not be important to you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Connect your iPhone\n\n*Click on the iPhone icon to see your device\n\n*Click on \"Podcasts\"\n\n*Uncheck \"Sync Podcasts\"\n\n\nNow on your iPhone\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Open Podcasts Settings\n\n*Change \"Auto Downloads\", \"Episodes to Keep\", \"Cellular Data\" settings to suit\n\n*Open Podcasts App\n\n*Check podcasts for old episodes.\n\n*If old episodes aren't there, you may need to delete and re-subscribe through the podcasts store (top left button)\n\n\nManual Method\nEDIT: See @jstaryu's answer above for simple drag & drop - it's actually much simpler than the manual method below.  If you decide to go manual - you should probably accept his answer as \"the answer\".  But I'll leave my version here for true manual hard-core podcast management.\nYou can manually add episodes to your iPhone.  The advantage of this method is that you can keep synching the way you have been.  The disadvantages are you have to have access to your computer, it gets tedious if you do this often, and you have to also manually sync your music / videos.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Select \"Podcasts\" from the upper left pull-down\n\n*Select the Podcast you want\n\n*Right / Control-Click the Podcast Title (on the right)\n\n*Select \"Show All Available Episodes\"\n\n*Download the episode you want\n\n*Put a check next to the episode\n\n*Click your \"iPhone\" on the top right\n\n*On the \"Summary Page\" scroll down to \"Options\" and make sure \"Sync only checked songs and videos\" is selected.\n\n*Re-synchronize your iPhone with iTunes.  The new checked podcast(s) should be there.\n\n\nWARNING - this will impact music / video synching as well.  You'll need to manually check-all or check the ones you desire to keep.\nHope this is helpful.\n\nA: Put the episode in a playlist. Select the iPhone in the sidebar and switch to the podcasts section of the iPhone. Scroll down a bit to the \"Include Episodes from Playlists\" section and put a checkmark next to the playlist you made earlier. Now, just sync and it'll be on your iPhone.\n\nA: \"cant you just go in to the podcast app and manually download the episode? – Macmaniman\n@Macmaniman \nI don't see a way to download an older episode.

I didn't find an option to do that in the Music app.\n\nA: No, you can't see this on an iOS device. If you create a smart playlist like this, you can look in iTunes, after syncing your iPhone, to see what you've listened to.\n\n\nA: This isn't a feature that's ever been directly included as a human readable list in iTunes, on an iPod, or any modern generation iOS device.\nThis information is stored in a machine readable format, which is used first for a song's play counts (viewable only in iTunes), but there is also software written to take advantage of this information, and send it to a 'listening history' service like Last.fm.\nI've used a lot of scrobbling apps on iOS. Many have worked over time, but if you use iTunes Match, I highly suggest using CloudScrob. If you don't, there are a myriad of other apps in the iTunes App Store, you can find them by searching for 'Scrobble', 'Scrobbler', or 'Last.fm'.\nNote that the official Last.fm iOS app (iTunes) DOES NOT scrobble songs you listen to via the normal Music app on your iPhone, it will only scrobble songs listened to via Last.fm's \"radio\" service.

I had my OSX partition and an Ubuntu partition.\nAs I don't use Ubuntu anymore, I decided to remove the partition and resize my OS X partition to use the whole SSD again. However, this didn't go as planned.\nAfter backing up my Ubuntu files to an external HDD I restarted my mac with Cmnd + R to go into restoration mode. There I erased the Ubuntu partition in the hope that would allow me to resize my OS X partition. Unfortunately, I don't see any extra space showing up inside the partition manager so I can't enlarge the OS X partition...\nWhile searching Google I came across someone with the same problem. It was suggested to empty the trash and also searching your harddisk for .sparseimage files and removing them, however I found none.\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions I can try? I desperately want my space reclaimed :(\nEdit: Some screenshots to clarify my situation:\nDisk Utility with SSD selected\n \nDisk Utility with OS X partition selected:\n\nAs you can see, the SSD has a total size of 120 GB. However, the sizes of the two partitions on it don't add up to this number (by far). So I must have some free space somewhere, but I have no idea how to get to it...\n\nA: You will not be able to reclaim this space to your OS X partition unfortunately. That is because the Recovery HD partition is in between your OS X and (formerly) Ubuntu partitions. You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the partitions tab, click the \"+\" and add a new partition. OS X will see this new partition as a separate drive, but it should be fully useable. However, it certainly complicates things vs. having a nice big single drive to work with.\n\n*Backup your Macintosh HD and wipe the entire hard drive (booting from another volume, such as Internet Recovery or Gparted on a disc). Then reinstall OS X, allowing it to properly recreate your partitions. This is more cumbersome but recommended.\nWhen I partitioned my Mac for Ubuntu (using rEFIt) a while back, I ended up doing the second option to make my Mac \"normal\" again.\n\nA: If you're asking what I think you are, simply click and drag the bottom right hand corner of the blue 'Macintosh HD' partition downwards to reclaim the space you've free'd by removing the Ubuntu partition. You don't need to reinstall OS X.\n\nA: The easiest way is to create a new partition from your startup partition.\nYou will notice that the new partition also gets the space of the free partition you want to get hold of. Then delete the new partition. And viola! you get the space of the whole physical drive again. all in one partition!\n", "Q: Downloading videos and saving to camera roll? I need a tweak like \"Download Manager pro\", which allows you to download any video you play.\nThe thing is, it saves to its own private storage (and not camera roll) so I can't share them with anyone.\nDoes anyone knows a tweak that does this job?\n\nA: There are a few tweaks for jailbroken iOS that can import videos into the Videos app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Music2iPod (free). I haven't tested this one though.\n\n*Bridge ($2).\n\n*The paid version of iFile ($4), using the Gremlin library.\n\n*YourTube ($4) also uses the Gremlin library and lets you import videos directly from the YouTube app.\n\n\nA: Titan Downloader (Video Download & Player - Titan Downloader) (app store app) lets you use browser inside the app & when you click on a video, you can save it to cache on the app & when you click on the videos tab you can save the video to camera roll or just keep it in the app, your choice.\nI personally bought the pro because it is worth it in all honesty.

This seem to work however I don't find it to be a reliable solution to my problem because sometimes it still forces me to initialise the sync and because SSH server can be running only when iPhone's screen is on, breaking the connection during sync.\nSo I was wondering if there is another way to wirelessly sync pictures between my Mac and iPhone without any interaction from me.\n\nA: Really, DropBox is the way to go. \nNot only will you never lose a photo to Photostream's delete, but Camera Uploads silently uploads all your iDevice photos—and automatically syncs them to your desktop, if you wish.

It's compatible with the original MagSafe design and provides enough power for all of the Intel Macs up to this point.\nPicking up a 45W or 60W wouldn't save any money and though they would both run all of the Intel Mac laptops they be insufficient for powering a larger (15\" / 17\") Mac back to life since they require 85W.\nShould Apple move completely away from the MagSafe design to the slimmer MagSafe 2 design you can add the adapter.\n", "Q: >console login - changing the screen size so when I log into the terminal from my login screen (by typing >console as username), I get logged in to the terminal.

Is there a Safari extension anywhere that shows a banner (or something equivalent) whenever you're logged-in to Google/Facebook/etc.? \nI rarely sign into Gmail from the web, and when I do I want to make sure I sign out as soon as I'm finished doing whatever I'm doing. I often forget though, and only notice days later that I've been logged in that whole time. \nAn extension that gives a clear \"warning\" when you're logged-in would be fantastic, and solve my problem, but my searches thus far have turned up nothing.\n\nA: I don't know of an extension that will warn you about remaining logged into Facebook or Google accounts. However, since your goal is to block web trackers from services like these, a better solution is to install an extension that blocks web tracking bugs. I personally use and recommend Ghostery. Ghostery works with Safari, plus Chrome, Firefox and IE, and it blocks Facebook and Google trackers, plus a slew of others as well. With a plugin like this you can also safely remain logged into your Google and Facebook accounts as well.\n", "Q: Would installing MacOS on a new partition fix my partition table? I think I messed up my partition table, would installing mac os on a new partition (to keep the old one which I WANT to use) fix that so when I boot the Option key works and everything runs smoothly?\n\nA: Yes, the answer is yes.

I'm working with 2 screens.\nOn the smaller I have documentation open while on bigger I have IDE.\nWhen making terminal fullscreen it will go big on one screen(bigger), while making other blank.\nIs there a way to leave docs open on smaller screen?\n\nA: This is a well documented problem with using a full screen app with multiple screens.\nEssentially when you start any app into fullscreen, it starts a new desktop.  Depending on your OS and keyboard you can hit F3 (for example) to get Mission Control to show you your active desktops.\nThe thing you need to understand is that both screens when you use an external display display the same desktop at the same time.  You may have different windows open on each display, but the desktop layer remains the same.  When you go full screen, it falls inbetween the cracks of showing the same desktop across all available monitors, and going full screen, which by definition can only be one screen.\nA lot of people would like to keep desktop 1 (for example) on one screen, and have the other screen hold a full screen app, but this would be simultaneously displaying 2 desktops at the same time, or rather 1.5 desktops...\nIt's an odd situation, but basically full screen and multiple monitors just doesn't work nice.\nAs a workaround, I would suggest using one of the many Window Management tools you can use to make your app as large as possible in a single click without actually using the full screen button that OS X provides.\nI like an app called Moom for this, check out the website for various things it may be able to do to help you workaround this issue.  Many other similar apps (better, worse, cheaper or just different!) are also available.\n", "Q: Disabling Command + Arrow scrolling When I press Command ⌘+↑ or Command ⌘+↓ on OS X 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion), it scrolls all the way to the top or the bottom of a window. \nThe problem is, in some programs, this results in crazy uncontrollable scrolling behavior, because for whatever reason the program doesn't signal to the OS that it's hit the end of its scrolling. It's driving me nuts. \nIs there any way to turn off this behavior? I've searched System Preferences > Keyboard settings to no avail.\n\nA: If your intention is to globally override this behaviour, this will do the trick:\nCreate a file called DefaultKeyBinding.dict and write on it the following:\n    {\n      \"@\\UF700\" = \"noop:\";\n      \"@\\UF701\" = \"noop:\";\n    }\n\n@\\UF700 is the Unicode value for Command+Up while\n@\\UF701 is for Command+Down.\nSave it and place it under ~/Library/KeyBindings/. If the folder doesn't exist, just create it.\nA different approach would be to override this shortcuts on each of the Applications you're having troubles with, assigning the problematic shortcuts to the Application's function you usually don't use, for instance. \n", "Q: Copying applications from applications folder to external and reinstalling osx Is it possible to copy all my applications from the applications folder onto an external, format my mac, reinstall OS X and finally copy the applications back into the applications folder for installing them?\nWill that work? I am asking because my macbook seems to be behaving in a very odd manner, has become excessively sluggish and is preventing me from recording anything in logic.. I have tried the usual freeing up space, clean desktop, fixing permissions, verifying and repairing disk as well as resetting pram and making sure I have all the latest software and firmware updates. The macbook is only 8 months old and is running Lion with 8gb of ram, I really cannot understand what is wrong with it. Even when trying to watch a movie, the player will get serious audio/video synchronisation issues and I noticed that every time my wifi is on the fans speed up like a plane taking off. I even checked and it is clean from any dust. I am perplexed :( \nIf anyone could help me please, I would greatly appreciate it. \nThanks in advance! \n\nA: Sure. That's definitely possible. I would recommend you use Time Machine to create a backup of your computer, that way you wouldn't lose any data. Also, because you're using 'Apple's way', its guaranteed to work better\n \n \nBacking it up: Time Machine\nTime Machine, by default, will backup your entire computer. However, you can choose to exclude certain folders from the backup:\n\nIn Time Machine preferences you can click the Options button to adjust settings. A sheet similar to this appears when you click Options:\n\nThis sheet allows you to exclude files, folders, or entire volumes from being backed up. You might want to do this to avoid filling up your backup drive.\n\n \n \nRestoring it: Migration Assistant\nThen, using OS X Recovery, you can do an Erase and Install. Once that is complete, you can use Migration Assistant to bring across certain information, like just your Apps, or perhaps your user information as well.\n\nThis would be the preferred way as it ensures just in case, you wont lose anything you explicitly want to and Apple system applications are reinstalled correctly.\n \n \nResources:\n\n*\n\n*HT1427 Mac Basics: Time Machine\n\n*HT4718 OS X: About OS X Recovery\n\n*PH11273 OS X Mountain Lion: Erase and reinstall OS X\n\n*HT4889 How to use Migration Assistant to transfer files from another Mac\n\nA: OK, so. As my predecessor said, it is possible, however:\nSome apps have resources in other parts of OS X Volume, i.e.:\n    /Library/Application Support/\ni.e. Minecraft or GarageBand. Copying them will not work, you'll have to copy things also in Application Support.\n\nA: Yes this is possible. You need to grab the applications themselves, which are bundles (actually directories disguised as applications) that have the .app extension. (confirm this by holding command key while clicking them and showing contents)\nNearly all applications save your settings (anything you change when clicking on settings within an application). These are stored per user under \"~/Library/Application Support\"\nSo in summary, you could copy everything with Finder or using the terminal / command line. \nCopy from Applications to External Drive\nNotice sudo because Applications are not in your user folder. They are available to more then one user -- if I could coin a term: \"cross-user\".\nsudo rsync -av /Applications/ /Volumes/ExternalMedium/Applications\n\nCopy Saved Settings to External Drive\nNotice backslash is to escape the space. Double quotations could also be used. sudo should not be necessary, because the files are in your user folder--represented by the ~. If you do not do this, the applications will still work, but will be like fresh installs (none of your previously settings will exist).\nrsync -av ~/Library/Application\\ Support/ /Volumes/ExternalMedium/Application\\ Support\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync = a tool whose location can be determined by typing which\nrsync on the command line\n\n*-a = archive mode, keep permissions \n\n*-v = verbose, show each file transferred\n\n*You would need to change the ExternalMedium to whatever name your external drive is. If there is a space in the name, type a backslash before it or double quote it.\n\n\nA: You need to copy the content of both the applications and application support folders. This can be done by drag and drop or via terminal command prompt.

Open up your favourite text editor on OSX (well, Textedit, Coda 2, a Chrome textarea at least). Type a long line of text, followed by a short line. Place your cursor at the end, like this:\nI am a long, long, line of text.\nI am short.|\n\nIf I want to delete the line \"I am short\" and the line break, in Windows I'd Shift+Up, then Ctrl+Shift+End. (Similarly, Ctrl+Shift+Home would select both lines in their entirety.)\nOn OSX, I can Shift+Up to select the second half of the first line fine, but Cmd+Shift+Right doesn't do anything. Cmd+Shift+Left does, however, select both lines like on Windows. You can repeat the same behaviour with using Ctrl+a/e for home/end.\nWhy doesn't Cmd+Shift+Right work? Can I make it work? Is there a similar command which would work?\nI know I can do Cmd+Shift+Left, Shift+Left and it achieves the same thing with the same number of pushes, but Shift+Up etc is pretty ingrained in my muscle memory. I still use a Windows PC on a regular basis too, so would prefer to use the same general method, and Ctrl+Shift+Home, Shift+Left on a PC is a bit more cumbersome as Home and Left aren't in the same block of keys.\n\nA: What if you want to select 78 here (after having pressed ⇧↑)?\n\nOr if you want to select both 12 and 78, on Windows you couldn't press shift+home and shift+end.\nMethods like moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection: are unanchored in most applications, which means that they always extend selections. They are actually anchored in Xcode, TextMate, Sublime Text, and BBEdit, but I don't know any way to change the default behavior.\nIf you just want to make selecting and deleting lines easier, you can create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"~l\" = selectParagraph:;\n    \"~z\" = (selectParagraph:, deleteBackward:);\n    \"~x\" = (selectParagraph:, cut:);\n    \"~c\" = (selectParagraph:, copy:);\n}\n\nAfter reopening applications, ⌥L should select a line. See http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/cocoa-text.html and http://lri.me/keybindings.html for more information.\n\nA: CMD SHIFT LEFT, (now let go of CMD), LEFT again is the only way I can sensibly replicate (as  you already found) the function you require.\nUnfortunately you might just have to accept that for certain things, differente OS do things differently, and whilst you can occasionally modify one to mimic the other, you cannot always.  For example, I bet you just love using @ and \" when switching between Mac and PC, or not having Delete or HOME key etc as a specific key on a short Mac keyboard.  We have to just put up with these things.\nMy solution, as it happens, was to buy a Mac keyboard for my PC, remap the keys for things like @ etc.  Not exactly a cost free workaround, but the one that provides me with the most commonality and consistency of input regardless of if I am using a desktop iMac, a Macbook, or a PC.\nAnother workaround might be to not select the newline in order to delete everything in 1 push, technically CMD+SHIFT+LEFT BACKSPACE BACKSPACE uses less keystrokes than either your Mac or Win methods, and is the same on both.\n", "Q: WiFi reception booster for MacBook air I live temporary in Spain. \nI have MacBook Air with OSX 10.8.\nI have access to public WiFi but signal is week, and I do not want to hang over the balcony all the time :), or crack my neighbors (strong) wifi (WPA protected).\nIs there a booster for WiFi signal reception, like a repeater (inverted router) or something like it.\nI was thinking of a device that would connect to a wifi and then boost the same signal so I can use it inside my apartment.\nMy budget is limited, so i appreciate a low cost maximum effect solutions.\nAny advice ?\n\nA: The easiest way is to use a wifi repeater.  Many routers can be put into repeater mode.  Put the repeater on your porch.\nInitially you have to attach the router to your laptop with an ethernet cable to configure it.  Directions vary between manufacturers, but in a nutshell, you want it to listen on whatever channel is the available one, then rebroadcast that on an un0ccupied channel at least 3 channel numbers away.  So if the current access point was on channel 2, you would want it to rebroadcast on 5 or above.\nGoogle wi-fi repeater.  Try amazon.  Should be under 50 bucks.\nA second solution that will work better, but is less convenient, is to put a wifi router on the porch, and put it in bridge mode, then connect to it with an ethernet cable.  This will give you full speed (repeaters cut your speed in half) and is less likely to cause/be subject to interference from other wifi points.\n", "Q: Automatically Connect to Multiple Servers on Login Following the instruction from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4011\nI can't get this to work for my multiple server logins, because they all have the same name (my user name).  When I try to add the connected share to the Login Items nothing happens, because one with the same name already exists.  How can I get around this?\n\nA: You are correct. Since both server volumes have the same name, Login Items will think you are trying to add the same exact shares to Login Items.\nTo get around this, create an Automator application that follows this basic pattern:\n\nThen drop this Automator application into your Login Items. Every time that you login going forward it will run the script, thereby mounting each of your identically-named volumes.\n", "Q: where are the \"best of the 90s\", \"billboard top 10 of 1982\"-style suggestion lists in iTunes?

But if that doesn't work for you, here's how to get JDK 6 back as the system default.\nThe Apple JDK 6 is installed on your machine; it's just being masked by the newer JDK 7. OS X's Java indirection layer will prefer newer versions. You can verify that it's there by doing /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6.\nThe Oracle JDKs live in /Library/Frameworks.

It will import your feeds from an XML/OPML file while retaining their folder structure. You can share an item across multiple social networks, star them, email a story, discover new feeds to follow, and easily organize your feeds.  MultiPLX, however, provides the option to export your starred or shared items to a JSON file like Google does in Google Takeout.\nMultiPLX is in private beta so will have to join the waiting list to get access, but they are fairly fast with the invite codes. Once you’ve gained access to the service, you can either add feeds on the topics suggested by the service, or import your feeds from an XML file. Importing may take a little time, depending on the number of your feeds.\nA number of RSS services are trying to fill Google Reader’s shoes, but most of them are paying little to no attention to the information a user would like to import. Many users are faced with the prospect of losing items they’ve shared, liked or starred, and it seems that MultiPLX, with its support to export them, might add support to import them in the future as well, and that would make it the best option for such users.\nEdit\nAlso worth considering:\nNewsBar Is a Minimal RSS Reader with iCloud Sync.

Now, by using the two phones side by side, you should be able to enter your passcode 'blind' using the position of the keys on the working phone as a guide.\n\nA: Unlikely, as what's the point of password-protecting it if anyone can get the data by plugging it in, but have you tried Apple Configurator? https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12\nor PhoneView? http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/\nOther than that, it isn't cheap, but data recovery services support iPhone now, although your particular need is possibly harder for them to assist with http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/devices-supported/apple-iphone-data-recovery/\nIt would be more to the point to just (carefully)replace the screen, with a part like they sell at http://www.ifixit.com/iPhone-Parts/iPhone-4-Display-Assembly-GSM-ATT/IF182-003 \niCloud offers relatively small space for free, but the auto-backup you can configure every time its plugged in would be saving your bacon right now, hindsight 20/20…\nGood luck, Allister\n\nA: I did exactly what Sherwood's answer said with my iPhone 5 that died on me yesterday.\nThe trick totally worked, after the Apple Store told me that there is NOTHING that can be done and that I would lose almost 1 year worth of data! If you want to check if the screen is still touch sensitive, either call your number and see if you can answer the call by hitting the area that would have the \"answer button\", or see if you can power the phone down by hitting the top button and do a \"swish\" where you would normally see the \"slide to power down button\" at the top of the screen.\nOnce you start it back up make sure you do another swish on the bottom of the screen where the \"slide to unlock\" button would be (I forgot about that one initially.)\nI found that I was not able to unlock the phone while I had it connected to my PC/iTunes. So unlock the phone first and then connect to ITunes to get a full backup. Hope this helps!\nNote that you can also use the accessibility options to help you. I activated the VoiceOver options (http://help.apple.com/iphone/7/#/iph2062e901c) while my phone was plugged into my computer through itunes to help me figure out what I was touching on my black screen, and select the appropriate buttons. Do this somewhere you won't be embarrassed to have your phone read to you though.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro (2009) doesn't recognise 7200rpm HDD I've been searching and searching for a solution to my problem and I've seen a lot of people have similar, but perhaps not quite the same, problem.\nMy original HDD failed on my MBP and I'm in the midst of trying to replace it, I wanted to make sure it was the HDD that had failed, so after backing the drive up, I formatted it and began reinstalling OSX Lion, however it keeps hanging during the install process.\nNext I managed to get hold of another 320GB HDD to try that one, however once I boot up the install disc and use DiskUtility, the drive does not appear. If I connect the drive externally via USB, I'm able to see the drive and format it to Mac OS X journaled, but once I connect it internally again, DiskUtility still does not see it.\nAfter trawling through post after post, I've tried downgrading the firmware to EFI 1.6 (still no luck), I've also tried using masking tape to thicken the SATA connector.\nThe main answer to come back was that the issue was the SATA Cable Connector in the Mac itself, however I'm reluctant to spend money buying a new one as I'm not convinced that is the issue due to the following...\n...I then connected a smaller (160GB) HDD which is a 5400rpm drive and amazingly this drive is recognised by DiskUtility and I can install OS X Lion onto it without any issue at all.\nI couldn't care less about enabling the 7200rpm drive for the faster transfer speed I just want my Mac to recognise the drive internally so that I can get the thing back up and running.\nDoes anyone have any idea why my Mac recognises a 5400rpm drive, but not a 7200rpm drive?\n\nA: I'll bet you a dollar that its the cable. \n\nA: Without researching your model at all, the HDD may have a cache size too big for your mac to handle. I know once I had to jumper down a momentus XT to work in an old macbook C2D.\nMaybe give that a look?\n", "Q: If I have an iPod touch (1st gen) can I install apps? I found what I think is a first gen iPod touch (see here).\nI had to restore it and it says it cannot update beyond iOS 2.2.1, build version 5H11.\nWhen I browse the App Store, all apps seem to require a minimum of iOS 4.3.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I upgrade iOS beyond 2.2.1?\n\n*Can I install apps?\n\n*Where can I browse for compatible apps?\n\n\nA: You can update an ipod touch 1G up to ios 3.1.3.  Finding available apps that work on ios 3.1.3 or earlier can be painstakingly hard using the Apple app store.  An app store app called \"VintApps\" makes this super easy.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/VintApps313\n\nA: After you upgrade to iOS 3.1.3 you can use this tool to search the iTunes store for apps that are compatible with the 1st generation iPod Touch. It's easier on a desktop computer. Select iPhone (original) from the menu.\nSee: iOSSearch: Find games and apps for 1st, 2nd generation iPod Touch,iPhone 3G, iOS 4.2.1 & 3.1.3\nThis is a non-commercial page I made.\n\nA: the las build support for the iPod touch 1G - 1.1.5 (4B1) (Free) iOS 3.1.3 (7E18) (Paid) \nso you should be able to upgrade sense you already have 2.2.1 \nnext regarding your need for the latest iOS to install certain apps, im afraid you are out of luck, see the API these apps use require a later os, usually 4.X cause of the multitask and so on\nSolution: Whited00r\n\nA: 1: You can upgrade to iOS 3.1.3, but I don't think Apple sells it anymore. After searching around, I found this, which is the iOS 3.1.3 IPSW for your iPod. It's on Apple's servers, so AFAIK it's legal. If you don't know how to install IPSWs, look here.\n2: You can install apps, as long as they support iOS 3.1.3. There are /some/ that still do. whited00r is themed to look like iOS 6, and works with your iPod touch, but more importantly, it has an app named the '3 Store' that lets you get old versions of apps that work for iOS 3.\nHopefully this helped.\n\nA: When installing whited00r to your iPod Touch, you need to downgrade your firmware from 3.1.3 to a lesser version. I found this after hours of trial and error. It will not happen with the latest 3.1.3.\n\nA: A change as of very recently allows you to browse the app store, and when you download an app if it is not compatible it will offer the chance to download the most recent version that is compatible (should there be one in existence).\n\n\nA: download ios 3.1.3  apps from here http://apptimemachine.com/apple.html\n", "Q: Putting Jailbroken iPad 1 into DFU mode I have a jailbroken iPad1 that is still using iOS 4.  I want to upgrade it to iOS 5, but I cannot get it to go into DFU mode in order to do so.  Can anyone identify the exact steps needed to either put the iPad into DFU mode, or upgrade via a different method?\n\nA: *\n\n*Plug the iPad into your computer\n\n*Launch iTunes\n(turn of your iPad)\n\n*Hold down the Power button and the Home button at the same time\n\n*Keep holding both of these buttons for 10 seconds\n\n*After 10 seconds pass, release the Power button but continue to hold the Home button for another 3-5 seconds\n\n*When in DFU mode, your iPad screen will stay completely black.

Or is only it an on-order option?\n\nA: Apple Retail stores carry the four \"stock\" configurations of MacBook Air, as well as what they call the \"ultimate\" model. The \"ultimate model\" is the 2.0GHz i7, 512SSD and 8GB RAM.\nThe model you desire (1.8GHz i5, 256SSD, 8GB RAM) is not sold in stores. You would have to choose between the \"ultimate\" model and the base configuration (which has 4GB RAM).\n", "Q: Programmer new to Apple - How to efficiently switch between files in XCode? I'm a programmer that's pretty much brand new to Apple software, and everthing is all weird and different and scary :P, so I'm trying to figure out some workflow stuff:\nI'm used to having a Visual Studio / Notepad++ style \"tab bar\" that has all the open documents so that I can have a group of files open to quickly switch between. The XCode navigator works for switching, but it lists all files, which in large projects makes it difficult to quickly work on a set of related files.\nI can tell that Apple eschews the \"single containing window\" thing, so I'm not looking for the same thing in XCode, but asking what's the Apple way of doing document switching?\nI can double click to open several windows, but I can't seem to find a way to \"list\" all open windows, and even though I was able to discover Command-Tab (or WindowsKey-Tab on my keyboard :) it only seems to switch between applications and not files.\n\nA: Xcode does support tabs. You can add a new one by pressing Command ⌘+T, or go to View > Show Tab Bar to keep the bar open always so you can press the + button there. With multiple tabs, you can use Command ⌘+{ and Command ⌘+} to cycle through them.\nAs mentioned by bassplayer7 in the comments, you can also use multiple windows and cycle through them with Command ⌘+`(backtick) or Command ⌘+~(tilde).\nAdditionally, you can have multiple documents open in one window using Assistant editors. Either use Navigate > Open in Assistant Editor, or click the icon which looks like a shirt and bow tie in your toolbar to bring the editor up. Then, you can use the little + in the upper-right corner of the editor to add more.\nThe Navigate menu has several other useful options too, such as going through an editor's history, various counterparts to a file (headers, implementations, interfaces, ...), and switching focus between various portions of the window.\nAs for the navigator, use groups to combine related files for easier access. Use File > New > Group or File > New > Group From Selection to add a group and rearrange things however you want. You can completely remove the original groups created in the original project if you want, since they are just for navigation and have no affect on the actual project.\n\nA: \nI can double click to open several windows, but I can't seem to find a\n  way to \"list\" all open windows, and even though I was able to discover\n  Command-Tab (or WindowsKey-Tab on my keyboard :) it only seems to\n  switch between applications and not files.\n\nAs @bassplayer7 said, command-` cycles between all open windows in an app. You might also want to use Mission Control – I believe the default keyboard shortcut for showing all windows of the current app is fn-F10 (you can double-check this by going to the Apple menu > System Preferences > Mission Control).\n", "Q: How to make the Macbook Air's Wifi connection as fast as a VM's? This is related to question To let a Mac automatically use Wifi and Ethernet to double the connection speed?\nIt is very strange that, in a hotel (La Quinta Inns), the Macbook connection both Wifi or Ethernet at 95 kbyte / s.  But after I installed VirtualBox and downloaded Ubuntu and installed Ubuntu as a Virtual Machine using the \"Bridged Adapter\" networking option and selecting \"Wifi\", the Firefox inside Ubuntu can pull data at 365 kbyte / s, as reported by both SpeedTest.net and by the Macbook's Activities Monitor for Networking.\nThis is very strange... what might be the cause and what can be a fix for this, so that the Macbook Air itself can use 365 kbyte / s?  (If I use my iPhone 5 or iPad 3 and run SpeedTest app, then the result is similar.  Assuming it is not the possibility that since Apple's device is quite popular, the network config at the hotel whenever detecting an Apple device, will lower the bandwidth, and allow PC or non-Apple device (such as Ubuntu) to run at full speed, what might be other reasons that causes it?)\nP.S. But if I unplug the Ethernet, so that the Macbook and the VM both use the Wifi, and then run SpeedTest, then the Macbook has 95 kbyte / s, and the VM has 365 kbyte / s.  I even just use curl to download a file on the Macbook, and it is 95 kbyte / s, so it is not due to the browser's USER_AGENT string indicating it is a Mac...  I then even ran the same command line inside Ubuntu, which is\ncurl http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/5/a/f5a3df76-d856-4a61-a6bd-722f52a5be26/PowerPointViewer.exe >| some-file-to-download\n\n(which is just to download some file), and when done in Ubuntu, the download speed became 365 kbyte /s.  This is strange because the VM is just using the Wifi connection on the Macbook to pull data... so why will the VM be faster with 4 times the speed?\nP.P.S. I called the tech support of the hotel and they told me they don't know about the VM, but they said the speed I get is normal, as they divide the bandwidth into smaller pieces... so he also gave me a \"Web Proxy\" to use and the speed is double as before.  And so I suspect that the VM / Ubuntu was able to somehow detect the proxy on its own and use it to gain the speed.\n\nA: Create a new account on your machine, connect to the wifi on a fresh account, and let us know if the speeds are the same.\nThere's nothing specific on a Macbook that would purposely slow down a Wi-Fi connection. If you go to the Wi-Fi icon at the upper-right of your screen. Hold down the Option Key, and click the Wi-Fi icon, it will give you more information, such as the wireless type; b,g,n and the connection speed 2.5GHz, 5GHz,etc.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: No notifications on iPhone 4 running jailbroken iOS 6.1.2 I have recently been given an unlocked iPhone 4 GSM, upon which I have installed a jailbroken (but not hacktivated) iOS 6.1.2 using snowbreeze. Calling seems to work fine, as does everything except notifications. They appear to be turned on in the notification centre settings, but I never get any.  I am not using the Apple Mail app, but I have Gmail, Facebook, Twitter installed and connected.  Can anyone suggest how I might fix this?\n\nA: It appears that this was caused by restoring an iCloud backup from a previous install which had been hacktivated. Notifications will not work with a hacktivated iPhone, and it seems as though they won't work with a restored iCloud backup of a hacktivated iPhone either.  \nThe solution is therefore to restore the jailbroken image and set it up as a new phone. This will then activate with Apple's servers and notifications will work.\n", "Q: I'm in Peru and having battery problems and electric shock issues with my new MacBook Air I purchased this MacBook Air in late 2012, found that the initial battery life was more than six hours in the US, then came to Peru. Peru runs on 220, and most everywhere that I am, the electricity is not grounded. Although I used a good quality surge protector, something happened with the battery within weeks, and it holds only about 1.5 hours of run time. \nIt shows that I'm getting 100% charge, and I had a technician here in Peru check it. He thought it was charging fine. In the meantime, when I used the computer while it was charging, I noticed that I was feeling electricity in my hands. Then my partner came by and felt a strong electrical charge running through my neck. Shortly after that, my neck  spasmed, followed by my lower back, then the other side of my neck and shoulder. \nI've tried various ways not to have my body act as the ground for the computer. I'm a writer and need to be at the computer for longer periods than the battery will hold.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: You could take a look at this question: How can I avoid my MacBook Pro giving me minor shocks?\nThe only real solution is to use a grounded power source. That's just how electricity works, unfortunately.\n\nA: Even if your Mac is grounded, if YOU build up a charge walking around, and then touch the Mac, you could still get a shock.  I am not worried about me, I am worried about harming the Mac.  (I don't know if that is a real danger or not.)  So I try to remember to touch something else that is grounded before beginning to work on the Mac.\n", "Q: Why would a large transfer to a USB drive take longer than expected? I am backing up 225 GB to a Western Digital USB 2.0 hard drive but this seems really slow. Any ideas on what I could do to make this transfer faster? It's saying it will take seven hours and it is a USB 2.0-only drive.\n\nA: I would run a terminal command like iostat 5 and also run Activity Monitor to see if other processes are taking precedence to the copy and also inspect the volume of IO operations as well as the aggregate read/write bandwidth.\nYou could have a bottleneck on the drive that is sending the data, the CPU that is doing the copy or the drive that is receiving the data in addition to the raw bandwidth of the external drive's connection.\nAlso, check in system profiler under the USB tree to inspect that the device is actually negotiated a USB 2.0 connection.\nSpinning HDD typically have a few hundred iops limit due to seek time even if there is perfect alignment of the data on the spindle so that the next block to be read is always directly under the read head when the drive schedules the next read. Other drive access, file fragmentation and other effects can often slow down a write to 50 iops or less which would clearly limit the transfer speed to 10 Mbps or less given typical block sizes for HFS+ filesystems.\nIn short, it might be a slow transfer due to the Mac or the drive sending the data and not a full or fragmented drive on the receiving end.\n", "Q: Will jailbreaking allow me to run apps that require iOS > 4.2.1?

I don't even mind actually paying for some stuff, it just won't allow me to download it says I need the iOS 4.3 which I can't even upgrade to.\n\nA: No - we have several related questions, the best phrasing of this problem is here:\nHow can I make an app think it's running on iOS 5?\nThe newer software has code the app needs to run, so faking apps out still leaves them crashing when they call the code that only exists in iOS 5 to run.\n\nA: Jailbreaking won't allow you to upgrade your iOS version at all - those are controlled by Apple, and are dependent on the hardware being used to run them. Your iPod likely doesn't have some capabilities that are needed to run iOS 4.3, and jailbreaking won't change that. Sorry...\n", "Q: How should I fix my Homebrew installation after upgrading OS X? Context\nMy employer gave me a MacBook Pro for development work; however, most of the development work I do in my research group is for Linux platforms, and for a host of policy reasons, I can't install virtualization software on this laptop. Homebrew looks like a good way in which to install these tools, especially because it looks very hackable (since it uses Ruby; MacPorts does not look hackable, because it uses Tcl). However, Homebrew relies on system libraries, and for security reasons, my employer may (and from what I hear, frequently will) upgrade my system at any time. I've heard that OS X upgrades will break Homebrew. (See, for instance, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7779300/how-should-i-upgrade-xcode-after-upgrading-to-os-x-lion).\nQuestion\nHow would I go about fixing my Homebrew install after an OS X upgrade? I am fine with deleting it and starting from scratch again, as long as I can do so in an automated way. (For instance, using Puppet plus a Homebrew provider to script a configuration that will automatically build upon running a shell script.) I've been Googling everywhere and can't seem to find any answers to this question.\n\nA: I think you might have been wondering about whether you need to rebuild all the packages rather than just uninstalling. If that is the case, I understand it is generally not a problem, as this answer says.\nI've had problems, especially when changing to OS X Mavericks and Xcode 5 I had to re-link all the packages I had installed -- here's my script:\n#!/bin/bash\nFORMULAS=(`brew list`);\nfor FORMULA in \"${FORMULAS[@]}\"\ndo \n    echo \"brew unlink $FORMULA\" && echo \"brew link $FORMULA\";\n    OUTPUT=`brew unlink $FORMULA`;\n    echo $OUTPUT;\n    OUTPUT=`brew link $FORMULA`;\n    echo $OUTPUT;\ndone\n\nNote the output, some formulas will require --force for the link step.\nIf that still doesn't work, try this command series from Mike McQuaid:\nbrew list > brew-list.txt\nbrew uninstall $(cat brew-list.txt)\nbrew install $(cat brew-list.txt)\n\nThere is now a rebuild command in HomeBrew, but that does not currently resolve dependencies.\n\nA: brew update\n\nUpdates the Homebrew installation. If there are any errors, they should be reported by brew doctor. Try fixing them else, you could use the uninstall script as follows:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Just copy and paste the lines below (all at once, it won't work line by line!)\n# MAKE SURE YOU ARE HAPPY WITH WHAT IT DOES FIRST!

Am pretty sure all this is configurable using puppet.\n\nA: If you want to force everything to upgrade to the latest version, you need to run brew with a --greedy flag\nbrew upgrade --greedy\n\nWarning : this may have undesired effects, i.e. upgrade to the next version of the app, that requires a paid upgrade. For example I had Dash.app v5., with this it upgraded me to v6, which I didn't have a license for yet.\nSo to see what will get upgraded, run it first with --dry-run flag\nbrew upgrade --greedy --dry-run\n\nSide-effect: if you previously removed a brew-installed app through other means (not via brew) - for example, I deleted Vivaldi browser just from the Application folder, using --greedy flag may re-install it, because brew will think that you still have an older version installed. You may want to clean that up first.\n", "Q: How to undo a Time Machine restore? I just attempted to restore a folder from TimeMachine.

What is the typical fan speed for a 15'' Retina Macbook Pro ?\nI would like to compare it with mine using istatpro\n\nA: I've been monitoring my fan speeds for as long as I've had my device. At idle, the lowest it gets is hovering around 2000rpm. The left fan is usually closer to 2100rpm, actually. The maximum speed appears to be 6000rpm, which occurs during gaming and heavy CPU loads.\nSMC Fan Control lets you monitor and control your fan speeds. The minimum setting is 2000rpm and the max is 6000rpm, so I think we can safely conclude that these are the standard maximum and minimum values.\n", "Q: How do you set the selection in iTunes in an AppleScript I'm writing a script in iTunes, part of which changes the selected playlist.

So for any Mac with a battery - keep with mode 3 and avoid modes 0 and 25.\nI never change Apple's default settings unless I have a reason that I can write down in a sentence as to why I want it changed. In this case, there's no real benefit to me for the alternate modes (and certainly not for any further unsupported combination that the full man page and pmset allows)\n\nHere is the manual page for pmset which has very excellent help and documentation on hibernate mode (I wish all man pages were this awesome):\n We do not recommend modifying hibernation settings. Any changes you make\n are not supported. If you choose to do so anyway, we recommend using one\n of these three settings. For your sake and mine, please don't use any-\n thing other 0, 3, or 25.\n\n hibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The\n system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must\n wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power\n loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\n\n hibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The\n system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and\n will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless\n a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\n\n hibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The\n system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and\n will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If\n you want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery\n life, you should use this setting.\n\nSo, as you can see - Mode 0 (binary 0000) is not really helpful for a retina MBP and doesn't save any battery. Mode 3 (binary 0011) is the default and what I recommend. If you didn't mind a slower sleep and higher amount of data written to the drive each time you enter sleep (as opposed to the write happening once sleep has drained the power to a low warning level around 5% reserve) you might try using Mode 25 to see if your slower sleep/wake is worth the extra battery life preservation since the Mac won't sleep but instead hibernates all the time with power off when the normal sleep time comes.\n\nA: \n\nNo - almost no one is so starved for battery power that full on Hibernation mode makes >>sense for them. So for any Mac with a battery - keep with mode 3 and avoid modes 0 and 25.\n\n\nI think you can safely turn off hibernate ( hibernate = 0 ) \ncheck the link below to know why.\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/22/why-hibernate-or-safe-sleep-mode-is-no-longer-necessary-in-os/  - vaidya\n", "Q: Add specific media types to iTunes without copying them to the iTunes Media Folder?

Now that Windows 8 is officially supported in the latest BootCamp, I am considering this for my Mac.\nThere is plenty of general advice about installing Windows 8 / Windows 8 Pro in BootCamp on a Mac.\nHowever, what I do not see is how to clean install a Windows 8 Pro upgrade on a mac with an existing BootCamp Windows 7 install. Clean install is an option offered in the upgrade install process for general PCs - but can this work on BootCamp?\nWhy do I want to install Windows 8 Pro upgrade ?\nBecause it's much cheaper than the regular version (though it is still a full OS install) and I am eligible in that I already have a legal licensed copy of one of the pre-requisite operating systems to qualify - I have Windows 7 64bit installed in bootcamp on my mac. In other words Microsoft offer Windows 8 cheaper if you have a legal copy of an earlier qualifying OS.\nWhat do I mean by Windows 8 Pro clean install?\nI also have a desktop PC which used to run Windows 7. I clean installed the Windows 8 Pro upgrade on this successfully. Although Windows 8 Pro upgrade is a full OS installation, during the install process, it will check the hard disk for the presence of a valid, licensed eligible OS already installed - in my case Windows 7. BUT, once its done that, it offers the option to format the disk on which it is to be installed. Obviously I would have backed up any valuable files, deactivated any applications and uninstalled them -ready to reinstall and reactivate them on the new OS later.  A fresh start. I prefer the clean install approach as to me this is the optimal deployment; no baggage/kruft/residue/ditritus/call it what you will from a prior OS. I also hear anecdotally from friends that an \"in-place\" upgrade whereby Windows 8 retains personal files and apps during install has proved unreliable for them.\nSo can anyone advise me about clean installing Windows 8 Pro upgrade on Bootcamp that already had Windows 7 installed?\n(By the way, I would not want comments or discussion about why I should have Windows/Windows 8 on my Mac. Not useful to me. I work in computing and prefer to keep a balanced informed opinion of what is out there to help me and others. Thanks!)\n\nA: It should be possible to do the clean install of a Windows 8 Pro upgrade on an existing installation of an earlier qualifying OS as these steps for Windows 7 suggest:\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2009/11/02/an-illustrated-guide-to-boot-camp-and-windows-7/\nIn this guide above, search for string: \"Theoretically, you're doing a fresh installation of Windows 7. In that case, select the \"Custom (advanced)\" installation\" \n(remove just the outermost quotes when searching for the string in the guide.)\nIn summary, after the Mac BootCamp app has done its original setup (including the partitioning), the rest of the setup is as per usual Windows installation - all the Windows steps are shown. In the event of the usual ReBoots, be sure to select the Windows drive to continue the installation.\nDuring the install, once the Windows 8 upgrade installer has found the previous qualifying OS on the disc, it can then offer the format disc as the clean installation option.\n\nA: Not sure if it helps, but I have done 2 installs of windows 8 pro upgrade, wiping the existing OS in the process without issue on windows computers. The existing OS was a trial version of the latest windows home server, I forget what its called. So, Windows 8 for the cost of an upgrade. Per one of the answers above, you have the option of completely wiping the existing OS. The upgrade should verify suitability to upgrade prior to commencing the upgrade process. I can't see why this wouldn't work on a mac with bootcamp. I will give it a go myself this weekend on my MBP.\n\nA: There is a big difference between a \"clean install\" and an \"upgrade install\".  A clean install of windows 8 on your mac wipes your exiting (window 7 PARTITION completely clean,  aka empty) PRIOR to installing windows 8, whereas an upgrade install over-writes the windows 7 partition, and \"may\" leave a ton of windows 7 unused files on the partition that \"may or may not\" cause a problem later with the new OS, so a clean install is always recommended, - but \"no good deed goes unpunished\".  IF you do a \"CLEAN install\" with a legal windows 8 UPGRADE OS, as it loads, it asks for your new windows 8 \"key/license\" and proceed with installing windows 8. After about 90 minutes of installation comes the problem.  The installer looks to your partition for the previous windows 7 \"key/license\". It ain't there - you cleaned out the partition of all data.  To use the technical term - your screwed !!!!!!!  No windows 8 - no windows 7.   To do a clean install windows 8 with the new bootcamp \"8 drivers\" you must have a new \"FULL - retail or full - OEM\" windows 8 with new key/license.  If not you can only do an upgrade install.  You can use the newest bootcamp app to do either install.\n\nA: For me, an upgrade isn't clean, so I recommand you to format the ntfs partition, resize the osx partition to max and renew the bootcamp operation.\nOtherwise you can use vmware to use bootcamp partition as virtual machine ;-)\n", "Q: On startup Calendar shows only one calendar The following problem has appeared a few days ago.

When my external Acer monitor is connected (via HDMI) while trying to put my MacBook Pro into sleep mode, everything works fine. But suddenly, after a few seconds, the HDD seems to wake up (I think its the HDD because of the noise) and to sleep again and wake up again. This happens all the time in 10-20 sec. time intervals. Furthermore, this only happens when the monitor is in standby. When I turn off the monitor via key or unplug the cable, the HDD stays in sleep mode. It seems like it's sending some data, which prevents the MacBook from going completely into sleep mode. I also connected it to my TV. There were no problems when connected to the TV. It seems like it's only happening with the Acer monitor.\nAny suggestions how to fix this?\n\nA: Can you open console after that and search for \"wake\"?\nThere should be something like \"kernel: Wake reason: \"\nI think it may give a hint.\nPS sorry, don't have enough rep to post it as comment\n", "Q: BootCamp 5 + Windows 8 troubles (unsupported hardware?) I preordered Windows 8 a while back, and as soon as I got it I tinkered around with BootCamp 4 (which technically only supports Windows 7) to get it up and running, since the only computer I have is a MacBook. It's been running fine, but since there's now BootCamp 5, which includes official Windows 8 support, I'd like to be able to upgrade. I figured the update would be delivered through Apple Software Update, but when I open it it only says there are no updates. So I downloaded the installer from Apple's support website but when I run it all it says is my hardware is unsupported.\nThe thing is, Apple's website says that BootCamp 5 supports the mid 2010 MacBook Pros and newer, which is exactly what I have.\nI don't know what to do. It's not crucial that I get BootCamp 5, but it'd be ideal. Anyone know what I could do?\n\nA: Note that the 13\" MacBook Pro, mid-2010 is NOT supported.  If you have a 15\" or 17\" model, then you should be able to update to OS 10.8.3 (DO NOT do this if you have a 13\" model) and get Boot Camp 5.\nDownload link for 10.8.3 (only if you have a supported Mac): http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1640\nIf you have a 13\" model and you've updated to 10.8.3, you may be out-of-luck unless you downgrade back to 10.8.2.\nAs of 10.8.3, they've added checks to the OS (and, it seems, bootloader) to check for a Windows 8 disc.\nIf your device is unsupported (see link [2] at the bottom), BootCamp Assistant will refuse to help you, stating instead that \"Windows 8 is not supported on this Mac.\"\nYou can still manually resize the HFS+ partition (the one that Mac OS X is installed on) via the Disk Utility.\nHowever, from my experience, trying to boot to the \"UEFI\" Windows 8 disc manually (by holding Alt/Option when turning your Mac on) just results in it loading into the Mac OS. (Preventing a Windows 8 install.)\nI downgraded to 10.8.2 and was once again able to install Windows 8.\nAs far as the BootCamp drivers in Windows 8:\n\n\n*\n\n*Regardless of whether you use the BootCamp 4 drivers (for Windows 7)\nor manage to obtain the BootCamp 5 drivers, you will need to\nnavigate to the \"\\BootCamp\\Drivers\\Apple\" folder in an Explorer\nwindow in Desktop mode.\n\n*Next, go to File -> Command Prompt -> Open command prompt as\nadministrator.\n\n*From there, type \".\\BootCamp.msi\" to launch the installer.\n\n\nThis should get around any \"unsupported machine\" issues.\nFinal note if you have NVIDIA graphics:\nBoot Camp 4's NVIDIA drivers are NOT COMPATIBLE with Windows 8.\nThese will likely result in your screen going black until you restart.  At which point, you should go to NVIDIA.com and download the latest drivers.\nYou can, potentially, stop these from being installed by using the Task Manager and choosing \"End Task\" on any NVIDIA installation during the Boot Camp 4 install.\nHopefully, this will help you get around Apple's attempt to force you to buy a new computer.\nOfficial Apple Info:\n[1] Apple's Boot Camp \\ Windows 8 FAQ: support.apple.com/kb/HT5628\n[2] List of which Macs support Boot Camp 5: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634\n\nA: On an unsupported Macbook all you need is an USB-stick, a Windows 7 DVD and a Windows 8 DVD. \n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to 10.8.3\n\n*Start Bootcamp and let Bootcamp download the latest drivers on the USB-stick\n\n*When Bootcamp asks for a Windows 7 DVD, insert the Windows 7 DVD.\n\n*When the mac restarts: remove the Windows 7 DVD, insert the Windows 8 DVD and boot from that one.\n\n*Windows 8 will install fine\n\n*When installation has finished run the bootcamp installation from the USB stick (Windowssupport\\Setup.exe)\n\n\nA: The Boot Camp assistant lets you download the support software from its menu even after you've installed Windows. Just download that to a memory stick, then install the software on your Windows 8 partition. \n", "Q: Back up iPhone that can not be unlocked--screen is broken/shattered. Need help! I left my phone on the roof of my car and drove away on a busy road.  It was hit several times and the screen is broken/shattered and glass comes off of it.  It receives calls/text messages, and the button on the top to turn on/off still works.  The screen is just in such bad shape that it won't register the touch of my finger.  I have an appt with Genius bar in a few hours to get a new phone.  I want to save all my pictures and apps off this phone if possible (I never backed up on the computer prior to this) but it prompts me to unlock my phone and I can't do it.  I can't use another iPhone as a guide, because it won't even recognize my finger touching the screen, but the phone still works.  Can I get some ideas on how to back it up?  I am not tech savvy and this is a difficult problem!\n\nA: How about PhoneView (http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/).  Although its not a true backup of your iPhone at least you can get all the important stuff off of it.\n\nA: Total Bummer about your phone. The genius appointment will cover where you might have your backups, but unless you can connect it to a computer that it has already synced, you will need a functioning keyboard-like input device to unlock the phone and make a backup to a new computer whether you use iTunes or a third party tool like Phone View. \nHere are your options:\n\n\n*\n\n*repair the digitizer and back up once the device lets you tap in the unlock code\n\n*use a bluetooth keyboard (one that was already paired) to enter the pin\n\n*use VoiceOver (triple tap the home button could enable that) to enter the pin\n\n\nBoth the VoiceOver and bluetooth options need the digitizer to set them up the first time, so if you didn't already do that before the failure, you may have to choose between a fixed phone and attempting your backup. (Just like backups are only good if they are done before the device fails or is lost).\nYou could also just look in iTunes preferences to see which devices are already backing up to your computer or log into iCloud on another device and see if and when the broken phone last backed up to iCloud. \n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: How to back up \n\nA: You may try to perform a backup of your device in DFU mode using Wondershare Dr.Fone. DFU mode is usually used to connected your device to iTunes in order to repair it due to software problems. You will find full tutorial in the link I provided.\nPersonally, I have never tried this app however backing up under DFU mode is really the only way that comes to my mind.\n", "Q: Virtualbox complete fullscreen I am running Windows via Virtualbox on my Macbook. It works fine. When I switch to fullscreen to screen the screen is actually full, but the windows windows does not spread out to the full extent. How can I fix that?\n\nA: I would guess that you have not installed the guest additions in your guest system.\nQuoting from the manual:\n\nIn the \"Devices\" menu in the virtual machine's menu bar, VirtualBox\n  has a handy menu item named \"Install guest additions\", which mounts\n  the Guest Additions ISO file inside your virtual machine. A Windows\n  guest should then automatically start the Guest Additions installer,\n  which installs the Guest Additions into your Windows guest. Other\n  guest operating systems (or if automatic start of software on CD is\n  disabled) need manual start of the installer.\n\n", "Q: Mail.app: connect to IMAP server with STARTTLS I have an IMAP account on a private server and they said me to configure my mail with a STARTTLS secure connection on the port 993 and authentication with standard password.\nHow can I set STARTTLS in Mail.app?\n\nA: First of all, notice that port 993 usually does not use STARTTLS. If you have been told to use port 993 and STARTTLS, then that would be very strange indeed. The different between STARTTLS and ordinary SSL/TLS is the following:\nWith ordinary SSL/TLS, which is what is usually used on Port 993, the connection immediately starts with an SSL/TLS handshake. In layman's terms, one may say that the connection is immediately encrypted. However, when using STARTTLS, which is usually used in combination with Port 143, the connection starts unecrypted. The first IMAP commands exchanged between client and server (including the STARTTLS command) are unencrypted. However, after the STARTTLS command, both client and server upgrade the unencrypted connection to an encrypted one. That means the SSL/TLS handshake is not done immediately, but only after the client has sent the STARTTLS command to the server. That's all.\nNow sadly, I have experienced that Apple's Mail App does not support STARTTLS on Port 143 and seems to only support encrypted IMAP connections over Port 993 using SSL/TLS.\n\nA: I haven't tested this combination, but you should be able to enable it by creating the account as normal (be sure to use IMAP for mailbox access), then going into the Mail application's preferences -> Accounts section -> your account in the list -> Advanced tab, then setting the \"Port\" entry to 993 and selecting the \"Use SSL\" checkbox.\nA couple of notes may clarify what's going on here: \n\n\n*\n\n*TLS is the new name for the SSL protocol (actually, for newer versions of the protocol); pretty much everywhere you see references to \"SSL\" they're really talking about TLS\n\n*There are two ways of initiating TLS (/SSL) for a connection: either connect to a special SSL port and initiate the TLS setup immediately (for example, \"http://\" URLs connect to port 80, but \"https://\" URLs connect to port 443 and go directly into TLS setup); or connect to a normal (non-TLS) port for the service and then use the \"STARTTLS\" command to upgrade the connection to TLS encryption.\n\n\nThe second point is the only worry I have here. Port 993 is normally the special port used for the \"imaps\" service, the go-straight-into-TLS version of imap. But in this case it sounds like the server provides plain-then-STARTTLS service on port 993, which might confuse Mail.app. I suspect it'll work fine, but I don't have a similar server to test with, so I can't be sure.\n\nA: TLS is NOT the new name for SSL. It's the new version of SSL. SSL had some serious security problems and then TSL was developed. There were some security issues with downgrade attacks from TSL to SSL, so they had to turn off the downwards compatibility to solve these issues\nSSL 1.2 != TSL 1.2\n", "Q: Is there a way to sync Google Calendar with iCal without CalDAV or EAS? As part of the spring cleaning announcement in which Google announced that they would be killing off Google Reader, they also mentioned winding down the CalDAV API.  Given that Google's Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync support was killed off in January, will there be any way to sync Google Calendar with iCal (on iOS) after CalDAV is shut down (September 16, 2013)?\n\nA: I just thought I would add to this question, given that it was posted in March, with no further activity. Google originally posted this to the Google Blog:\n\nCalDAV API will become available for whitelisted developers, and will be shut down for other developers on September 16, 2013. Most developers’ use cases are handled well by Google Calendar API, which we recommend using instead. If you’re a developer and the Calendar API won’t work for you, please fill out this form to tell us about your use case and request access to whitelisted-only CalDAV API.\n\nShortly thereafter, they added this:\n\nWe worked with the developers who provide 98 percent of our current CalDAV traffic to assure access to the CalDAV API, which means many popular products will not be impacted. We remain committed to supporting open protocols like CalDAV. \n\nAs I've heard nothing to lead me to believe otherwise, I presume the current state of things at Google is to continue to support CalDAV. Of course, as with anything else, this could change.\n", "Q: Duplicate songs when sync with iPad 1 When I connect my first-gen iPad to my Mac, I have in duplicates in my iTunes. This song have a gray font and have a circle next to their names. Here is a screenshot:\nAny idea how to remove this songs? Why do they always show up even after deleting all of my songs off of my iPad?\n\nA: The songs that you are seeing aren't on your iPad - they are simply still downloading. I believe you can stop them from downloading from the iTunes Store on your iPad or your Mac.\n\nA: In my opinion, you can use a third-party tool to find and remove the duplicate songs in your iTunes. I once tried with a program called MUSIC CLEANUP. It helped me quickly find and delete all my duplicate songs at once.\n\nA: I find solution here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3651197?start=15&tstart=0 at leeg330 user answer.\n", "Q: Default settings for pmset -g?

I'm looking on the 'safe' Cflags on the Gentoo Wiki, and I want to figure out how to see which CPU is on a specific machine. \nOn Gentoo I see you can get this with \ncat /proc/cpuinfo\n\nbut on Mac I get \n\nNo such file or directory\n\nWhat is the equivalent for OS X?\n\nA: From terminal, you'll want to start with system_profiler\n system_profiler SPHardwareDataType\n\nAlso, much more data is available from ioreg but you'll need to parse the output (which can arrive as XML if you prefer) to get things like actual bus and clock frequency of each core.\n\nA: On the other hand, if you don't want processor name, speed, the number of processors, etc but you're interested in the model number, you might want to give sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string a try, eg.\n$ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string\nIntel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E7600  @ 3.06GHz\n\n", "Q: Can not select Airplay Device in OSX When I click on my Airplay speaker in Sound settings, it jumps back. \nI have to restart my Mac in order to fix this problem. \n\nHow can I fix this issue without restarting my Mac?\n\nA: There is command line solution that I've found in Mac Rumors \nsudo kill `ps -ax | grep 'coreaudiod' | grep 'sbin' |awk '{print $1}'`\n\nWhich can assigned to an alias:\nalias fixairplay=\"sudo kill `ps -ax | grep 'coreaudiod' | grep 'sbin' |awk '{print $1}'`\"\n\nThen this command fixes the issue:\nfixairplay\n\n\nA: What you need to do is to restart the coreaudio deamon (coreaudiod). Open up the terminal and run sudo killall coreaudiod. As simple as that.\nThen if you're having a difficult time memorizing the above, you can add the following line to ~/.bash_profile\nalias fixairplay='sudo killall coreaudiod'\n\nFrom now on you can just use the alias fixairplay.\n\nA: Inspired from Mohsen, but simplified by using pgrep.  \nsudo kill `pgrep coreaudio`\npgrep's reason for existence is to avoid parsing ps output and is much safer to use when being sent to kill, IMHO cause you are less likely to grab the wrong process info.\nAnyway, the accepted answer worked great (Mavericks).\npgrep @ wikipedia (man is waaay too obscure)\n\nA: I've had the same behavior with HDMI, as well. I.e. For some reason which I have yet to identify, my mac mini (running Mavericks) will switch to using the internal speakers, and any attempt to switch back to HDMI doesn't just bounces back to internal speakers.\nKilling coreaudio (which will then restart itself) fixes the HDMI issue as well.  @0sh and @jl-peyret have the simplest commands, which can be entered in the terminal:\nsudo kill `pgrep coreaudio`\n\nor\nsudo killall coreaudiod\n\nFor people who like to shy away from the terminal, you can also quit the coreaudiod process from the Activity Monitor.\nThere are some other recommendations, if this doesn't fix things, in this article, though some of them are a bit extreme.\n", "Q: Can a Time Machine drive have several partitions, or does Time Machine need the whole HDD to itself? Is it possible to partition and external drive an use only one of the partitions for a Time Machine backup?  Or does Time Machine need its dedicated hard drive?

Is this feasible?\n\nA: Time machine doesn't care what else is on the destination drive as long as the volume (partition) you choose meets the minimum requirements. If the volume you select isn't formatted properly, Time Machine will offer to erase and reformat the part of the drive that will contain your backups.\nYou might want to try resizing partitions using whatever tool you want before you start accumulating a lot of Time Machine data in case you want to be able to adjust the size of the partitions down the road, but that's more of a problem with partitioning and not something that Time Machine causes.\n", "Q: 2007 iMac kernel panics repeatedly I have an iMac (24-inch Mid 2007) which has recently had a lot of kernel panics (a screen pops up telling me to reboot).

Seems simple, but I can't find anything that works.  \nDevice is jailbroken, looked very carefully through Cydia, and even through some of the alternate repositories.  I've tried off and on for months, digging and digging, it's been really frustrating.\nI found this post: Can I block ports and network traffic when using Personal Hotspot? here on apple.stackexchange, and tried installing ipfw via theworm.altervista.org/cydia.  It installed without issue, but no matter what I do it just says: \nipfw: getsockopt(IP_FW_GET): Protocol not available\n\nFound this post: http://nixcraft.com/all-about-freebsd-openbsd-netbsd/3726-ipfw-getsockopt-ip_fw_get-protocol-not-available.html which suggests creating a file: /etc/rc.conf, with the following:\nfirewall_enable=\"YES\"\nfirewall_script=\"/usr/local/etc/ipfw.rules\"\n\nBut that didn't help at all, still get the same error.\nI'm aware of the Cydia/commercial software \"IP Firewall\", which would help with much of what I want to do, but not everything. \nPlease help!\n\nA: It seems \"simple\", but ipfw (or pf) require support directly within the kernel. That means Apple has to compile the iOS kernel to support those particular utilities and their required protocols (ipfw is a front end for ipfw and dummynet, the latter of which does the bandwidth shaping).\nFirewall software (like ipfw) in Unix based systems run at the kernel layer (deep) and cannot be added unless the kernel itself supports them. OS X supports ipfw/pf but iOS does not. Apple has gone through great lengths to secure the OS and likely feels it an unnecessary addition (it's not that Apple has turned them off, they simply do not exist so no conf configurations will aid you). This is why you receive the protocol error. While iOS can run the program, ipfw cannot negotiate the required protocols because they simply do not exist. \nAt best, your only option is to find a firewall that runs atop the kernel, so in userspace (like Little Snitch on OS X for example).\n\nA: This thread over the FreeBSD forums suggests that pf works on iOS. \nDisclaimer: I haven't tested this myself.\nEdit:\npfctl -sr\n\nas root returns:\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\n\nand no rules whatsoever, but it seems that pf is there\n\nA: I've always run Firewall iP on JB iOS, and really like it. http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.yllier.firewall\nI never checked that pfctl is also available on iOS -- it would be very nice to put together a iOS-oriented pf.conf and run the iOS firewall at load time to have a kernel-level firewall.\nIt's also possible block malware, trackers, and adware by downloading a list of bad hosts from hphosts.org and appending this to the /etc/hosts file.\n", "Q: Install Windows on MacBook Pro without Optical or USB Boot I have a Mid-2010 MacBook Pro (MacBookPro6,1) and my optical drive has died. I need to install Windows on it, and was hoping to do so via Boot Camp.\nI have a Windows 7x32 .iso and have also created a (nominally, untested) bootable USB stick via the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. Using the tip on this page I can mount the disk image locally and get Boot Camp to create the Boot Camp partition, but when I reboot I see \"No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\". Presumably this is because I cannot boot from USB on this older model MacBook Pro.\nI've purchased Paragon NTFS in the naïve hope that creating a NTFS partition and copying the ISO or bootable USB to that would work, and tried using rEFIt to boot from such devices.

Use bootcamp to copy the ISO on a 8Gig (or more) USB Drive. Then boot from it by pressing option at the boot chime. \n\nA: I had a similar problem with my macbook pro early 2011, I replaced my optical drive with a second hdd and tried to install windows on bootcamp via usb.\nUnfortunately only the macs that come without a optical drive like the retina or air models are able to install windows via usb it is hard coded in the bios of the machine and I was told I can not change it.\nNow I use vmware to run windows for small tasks, but as stated above you don't want to game on it..\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not possible. If your MacBook came with an optical drive, the CSM Mode of Apple's EFI will only boot from the optical medium.\n\nA: I'd highly recommend installing Windows on virtual machines like VMWare or Parallel Desktop. These applications would let you choose the ISO file on Mac OS X hard drive for installing. The performance is decent for regular tasks, unless you're looking for a gaming platform.\nIf you'd insist to install Windows on Bootcamp, you can create a bootable Windows 7 installer media on a USB flash drive.\n", "Q: If I update my iPhone 4S from iOS 6.1. to iOS 6.1.2 - will it crash?

I had a look at the hard drive manager and the bootcamp partition (I've set it to 303gb) was already there. After having a closer look i noticed that the partition was in the middle of a 1.7 tb partition which was now used for the fusion drive and a 800gb partition that wasn't used anymore.

The problem occurred when I first manually moved all the folders under USERNAME/Music/ on my computer to a folder on my external drive, opened the Music application on my computer (formerly iTunes) while holding the option key, changed the library to refer to the copied library now in the external drive, and under File > Organize Library..., checking \"Consolidate files\" and clicking ok. This created the exact same issue where I ended up with duplicates of all the songs in the new copy of the iTunes Media folder with a one (1) at the end of each duplicate file. These duplicates were the ones being referred to by each song in my library, and the originals did not show up when I checked for duplicate songs on the Music Application.\nHere is how I got rid of the duplicates using only the Music application on my computer and two different folder locations, the original location and a new location. In my case, the original folder location is on my external drive, where I want my files to be now, and the new one is in a temporary folder on my internal drive, but you can change this to meet your needs.\nNOTE: If you use two folders in the same drive, make sure you have enough space on the drive for two copies of your music files.\n\n\n*\n\n*When in the Music application, go to the Music menu, choose Preferences, and go to the Files tab.\n\n\n*\n\n*Under Music Media folder location, click Change…, then go from the original folder where the music currently resides to the new folder to where the music will be moved (this may be from the external drive’s folder to the internal drive’s folder, or from an internal drive’s folder to another folder in the same drive).\n\n\n*After that process is done, in the Music application, go to the File menu, go to the Library submenu, and choose Organize Library…\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the Consolidate files option, then click OK. This will make copies of the music files to the new media folder without affecting the original files in the original location.\n\n\n*After the copying process is done, check the songs in your Music application library, both those downloaded from Apple Music and those that are yours, and make sure that they are referring to the files in the new location. To do this, right-click the song or click the three horizontal dots that show up when your cursor hovers over the song, choose Get Info, and go to the File tab.\n\n\n*\n\n*Near the bottom of that display, the location value should refer to the new folder instead of the old one.\n\n*Verify that the songs are not showing duplicates anymore by going to the new folder and seeing any album of songs there.\n\n*Verify that the songs from different sources are able to play.\n\n\n*NOTE BEFORE DELETING MEDIA: Audiobooks, ringtones, home videos, and other media types will not copy through the Apple Music application anymore. If you want to keep these, do not delete them.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the original folder, you are now able to delete the Music and Apple Music folders.\n\n\n*You now have your library residing in the new folder. If you want to move the music back to the original folder, just repeat steps 1 through 4. Otherwise, you're done!\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the Music Media folder location back to the original folder.\n\n*Go to Organize Library…, choose the Consolidate files options, and click OK.\n\n*Check each type of song in your Music application library, check the original folder to make sure that there are no more duplicates, and make sure they can play.\n\n*In the new folder, you can safely delete the Music and Apple Music folders.\n\n\n\nA: The most possible issue is you already have added songs (with copying to iTunes folder, it's by default), removed them with 'keep files' variant.\nfollowing steps should fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove weird titles from iTunes library and quit from. \n\n*open your iTunes media folder ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Videos (you can find it in preferences)\n\n*remove weird titles from this folder (you can save correct file copies if you have no backup)\n\n*Also you should remove these entries from iTunes library. \n\n*re-add correct versions into library. \n\n\nUPDATE: added awk script and description for.\nHow to use this script:\n\n\n*\n\n*save it to the file named ~/dups.awk (~ is your home directory)\n\n*open your Terminal.app and change directory  to your iTunes media folder like we talked before (e.g. cd \"~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Meda/Videos\")\n\n*remove duplicate files with command find $(pwd) -type f|sort -r|awk -f ~/dups.awk| xargs -L 1 rmtrash\nsome important notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*this script does respect unicode and spaces in file names. I've tested it.\n\n*I believe that unix-way tools are enough to do this task.(they are the fastest too)\n\n*rmtrash is utility from MacPorts, sends files to your Trash.\n\n*rm command remove files directly from file system and they can't be restored from trash bin. This is the fastest and the best way if you really sure what do you do.\n\n*using automated stuff like this I always double check if there's no mistakes in output. You can replace command xargs with arguments with less command or redirect output to the file (e.g. ~/dups.txt)\n\n\nfunc checkfile(a,b)\n{\n    if (length(a)+2 < length(b) || a != substr(b, 1, length(a)))\n        return 1;\n    suffix = substr(b, length(a)+1);\n    return !match(suffix, \"^ [0-9]+$\");\n}\n\nfunc cutext(a)\n{\n    return  substr(a, 1, length(a)-4);\n}\n\n{\n    file=cutext($0);\n    if (length(name) > 0)\n        if (checkfile(name, file))\n            name = file;\n        else\n            printf(\"%s\\n\",$0);\n    else\n        name = file;\n}\n\n", "Q: My iPhone thinks it's always docked -- Volume slider disappeared with no audio output EDIT3*\nI managed to fix this problem in a risky way, but it worked for me. Read below.\n\nPin 11 apparently carries out the following function :\n11   GND     \nIf connected to GND the iPhone sends audio signals through pin 3-4\notherwise it uses onboard speaker.\n\nSource\nMy iPhone is stuck at the function of using an onboard speaker (dock), and only produces sound when connected to a dock or a charging connector. Whenever I take it out, the phone mutes itself except for ringtones.\nI am guessing that some switching mechanism is stuck at that setting. Does anyone know if there is a specific pin-like switch that needs to be adjusted to fix this ?\nEDIT\nI noticed that sound only plays when connected to the charging dock and powered on. Using the cable with no power OR without the dock mutes the phone. If I remove the iPhone from the dock while it's playing music, it continues for a few seconds and then mutes, the music player is still running on play, but with no audio output.\nEDIT2\nWhen trying to connect the AppleTV, I found the following evidence that shows how the iPhone thinks the dock is connected.\n\nThe iPhone was NOT docked at this time.\n\nA: I found a method that worked for me. If you're having a problem similar to mine and cleaning the dock did NOT work for you, try this at your own risk.\nDisclaimer : This method might permanently damage your iPhone, mine is out of warranty so it wasn't a big deal if I damaged it, I would still need to pay for replacement.\nI don't know what may have caused the phone to lock at the docked state, but my first thought is that there is a switch mechanism inside the dock connector. All I did was get a key and jam it there, and rotate it a bit until it got fixed.\nNote: If I inserted the key there and did not rotate it, the problem is fixed temporarily until the key is removed. The only way I got rid of the problem completely is to rotate the key and push the pins downward.\nIf you try to insert the key and remove it, the problem still persists. I had to jam the key in deep and rotate it a few times (gently) to permanently fix this issue.  \nMake sure you insert the key in the middle - left part of the dock connector, that's where  pin 11 is located (I think). \n\nAfter placing my phone on a dock again, I lost control over the sound. I did the same method with a bit more rotations using the key and now the problem is gone 100%. Not sure how, not sure why, but it worked.\n\nIf using a Key seems too risky for you, read below \nUse cotton wool from the end of a qtip (but not the qtip it's too wide to go in) use a nail file or a very thin screw driver to put the cotton wool inside the docking part and gently move back and forth. If you use alcohol even better. \n(PS i tried a lot of compressed air and a toothbrush and it didn't work - the iPhone was about 3 years old so it was filthy inside. The cotton wool came out surprisingly dirty - ie the tooth brush and the compressed air will work if it's a little dirty or there is a little bit of lint - but not if its very dirty.) \nGood luck. \n\nA: I've fixed this exact problem by clearing out pocket lint from inside the iPhone dock connector with a paper clip.  Hope that helps..\n\nA: When I see this issue, it is usually because the dock connection has liquid damage.  Check for a rectangle near the pins.  It will either be white for no liquid contact or a pink/red color indicating liquid contact.\n\nA: Clean the dock connector with a qtip and a tiny bit of alcohol gently.\nAfter that, plug it into your computer to backup and do a full reset, restore from backup, and all should be well.\n\nA: I charge my phone for about an hour without touching it, after that, the problem is gone \n\nA: All I had to do was grab an old tooth brush with frim bristles and scrub under there really good with some alcohol and electronics cleaner\nEDIT-  It's still not working all the time so I probably have to keep at it periodically until its goes away completely or I can do a hard reset.\n\nA: I ended up using a very small screwdriver and while cleaning out the dust.\nWhen I pushed a little bit on the right side of the white part under the connector, I felt it pop back in place.  Now the issue is gone.\nAgreed I had a similar issue checked for corrosion (none found) I cleaned w/ toothpick nothing.  Took a smaller flat head drew driver apply gentle pressure to the 30 pin connector.  The sound/docked indicator disappeared intermittently.  It seemed to be at the bottom left part of the connector as you are facing the iphone 4.  I repeated the process in the area mentioned and a small dull click occurred.  The connector seemed to be reseated.  It is now functional.  Small pressure.  This fix has the potential to go really wrong!\n", "Q: Any risks in creating custom OS X extended attributes? Is there any risk associated in creating your own custom extended file attributes?  For instance:  \n\n\n*\n\n*should I be worried about naming collisions?  \n\n*is there any file instability or increased risk of data loss associated with adding extended attributes?\n\n*is there anything else I should be concerned about that I'm not thinking of?\n\n\nExtended attributes could be very useful to me for keeping track of file metadata that doesn't have any where else to be kept, and which I would like to keep about my important files with my important files.  But I'd like to know what possible downsides there are before I start adding them to my files.  \n\nA: So far the only risk I've found is that some applications will overwrite the custom extended attributes.  TextEdit is one such example.  It will remove the attribute and add a quarantined attribute in its place, which will cause the Finder to give you a warning (that it was downloaded from the internet) when you open it.\nSo if you don't want to lose the metadata you've added to your custom attributes, don't open in unsafe applications like TextEdit.  TextMate and SublimeText 2 and vim don't damage your data, however.\n(And as for name collisions, just follow the reverse DNS naming that Java uses.  For example 'com.yourdomain.yourcustomname'.)\n", "Q: Macbook pro crashes occasionally on dual monitor I'm using a Macbook pro 13' mid 2010 running OS X Lion 10.7.5.

The answer is:\nFor the software update you would like to hide - make sure the full description of the update is shown - click \"More...\" if needed to show the full description\nRight click on the update window.  Select \"Hide update\"\nThis will hide the update and it will not show in the App Store Updates Window or counted on the dock icon.\nTo restore - select \"Show all software updates..\" which is now shown in the App store \"Store\" menu.  Then \"Reload Page\" from the Store menu.\n\nA: Try the --ignore option of softwareupdate.

I backed up to my trusty Time Capsule (as per norm) before the disk replacement, planning to restore from said Time Capsule. However, when it came to this stage, instead of finding two backups available (the TC is also used by a laptop), the Migration Assistant showed not two, but only one backup, furthermore it was the backup for the laptop. My heart sank for a minute.\nThankfully the TC has two distinct sparsebundles on it, one of which is the iMac's backup, but for some unknown reason it is not being volunteered by the Migration Assistant.\nMy plan B is to retrieve the needed files from the desired sparsebundle, but would prefer to retrieve all my files, settings and system settings in one elegant hit.\nCan anyone advise?\n\n\nA: See this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/75892/27953\nYou need to use the associatedisk subcommand of tmutil, so Time Machine associates the backups with your new disk.\n\nA: The answer was disappointingly straightforward. The backup that would not restore via the Migration Assistant was not a complete backup. This is the top level contents of the sparsebundle that was offered.\n\nShown in red are folders that were (deliberately) omitted from the the sparsebundle that I needed, from which Migration Assistant would not offer to restore.\nThe precursor to Migration Assistant, Setup Assistant was good enough to point this difference out.

I've downloaded the Handbrake CLI. What's the best place to install a command line app on my Mac?\n\nA: The best way to install anything on OSX is (IMHO) with Homebrew.

I absolutely love the Cocoa text engine. A few modifications to a little xml file - ~/Library/DefaultKeyBinding.dict - and you can get just about any key sequence to work in any standard Cocoa text field in any application. \nFor example, I've added a bunch of emacs key bindings like CtrlA for going to the beginning of a line, ⌥F for moving forward a word, ⌥B for moving back a word, etc.\nAnyhow, I've noticed that a few applications - even though they seem to use the Cocoa text engine and use standard Cocoa text field widgets - have this annoying way of subverting my emacs key bindings. In some text fields, the Option key is used to type Unicode international characters.\nIs there any way of disabling this globally? I don't ever want the Option key to do this - if I want to type a Unicode character, I'll use the character viewer. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Some applications and text views just don't support DefaultKeyBinding.dict.\nIf you create a new keylayout with Ukelele, you can for example make ⌥A insert nothing instead of å. Or you can reassign key combinations that enter dead key states (like ⌥U on the U.S. layout) so that they can be in used in DefaultKeyBinding.dict.\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard layouts in ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ can't be selected in password dialogs or the login screen, but ones in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ can.\n\n*XML keylayout files don't work with the popovers shown when holding keys, but keylayout bundles do.\n\n*To apply changes to a keylayout, you currently have to for example run sudo touch /Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts/ and log out and back in.\n\n*The default input sources can be removed by editing ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist.\n\n\nKeyRemap4MacBook can for example change ⌥B to ⌥← in all applications except iTerm and Emacs. See this question.\n\nA: There might be more simple ways than the one I am mentioning below.\nWhat you're describing in essence boils down to: which has precedence over the other, the keyboard layout or the DefautlKeyBinding.dict. This part I can't answer. However I know how to prevent Unicode characters production when using either of or both option and control modifier keys.\nI used Ukelele to make a custom keyboard layout for another language. For your situation, I would make a new keyboard layout based on my current keyboard layout, then delete all characters produced while holding either/both option and control modifier keys.\nI have used it personally to produce my own keyboard layout for Arabic and it does what it was intended to do.\nAfter you customise your keyboard layout, all you have to do is place it inside your home folder's Library/Keyboard Layouts/ folder. Of course you have to create it if it is not already present.\nPlease note that some application have their own hardcoded key bindings, specially text editing applications. So, this answers only the part in regard to disabling the Unicode characters produce with option and control keys.\n", "Q: Is there a hand tool for xcode's storyboard (scrolling without scrollbars, PDF style)?

I want to be able to add my Final Cut Projects and Events folders to Time Machine, but annoyingly Apple have decided to put a Render Files folder within each and every Events folder.\nIs there a way of moving the folders to a different location on the hard drive, such as a Caches folder? Or is there some way of telling Time Machine to ignore folders containing the words \"Render Files\" (using some kind of script perhaps)?\n\nA: I have realised today, that OS X seems to automatically omit Render Files in the Time Machine Backup.\nApparently, Time Machine intentionally doesn't backup certain files/folder.  The file /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.pl‌​ist includes all absolute paths (globally and for each user) that TimeMachine ignores, as suggested by this article. File-patterns, are, however, not included in this file.\nNote\nI have examined this behaviour by comparing the two directories after a completed backup:\ndiff --brief -r timemachinefolder localfolder\n\n\nA: One simple solution (2018, FCPX 10.4, macOS 10.13) is simply to keep render files external to your FCPX library file in a location which you exclude from Time Machine. Apple macOS Time Machine can exclude folders, but not individual files or file patterns.\nFor your FCPX library, examine the Library Properties. In the Inspector window by \"Storage Locations\" click the \"modify settings\" button and then change the Backups location to a folder, not the library. See FCP X help article \"Manage Storage Locations\"\nFor example you could create and choose a folder /Users/myhomefolder/Movies/FCP X Cache And Renderfiles, and exclude it from Time Machine in System Preferences -> Time Machine -> Options. \nEach library will have a .fcpcache bundle of the same name generated for it. These files can be regenerated and re-rendered from source media if they are lost or deleted.  See \"Manage Render Files\"\n", "Q: Suggestions on what to do with an old Power Mac G4? So I've had an old Power Mac G4 sitting around collecting dust. \nRealistically, is there anything I can do to salvage this old, run down machine?\nMy thoughts were to turn it into a backup server but again realistically how much power will that run? I assume its a power hog.\nI'm mainly, dare I say it, a Windows users but use my iMac just as much as my Windows PC.\nSalvage for parts? Ideas? Just trash it?\n\nA: My idea, you could try to run a server on it for back-up purposes or website hosting maybe? I don't know if you're interested in that part at all.. If it's a big power waste, you'd better get rid of it and buy a replacement instead of wasting the cash on power :)\nTrashing it is the last option left IMO.\n", "Q: Google Contacts sync with iPhone 3G (iOS 4) without EAS I'm setting up an old iPhone 3G (latest iOS 4.x.x) and I'd like to sync contacts with Google.\nExchange ActiveSync (EAS) is no longer an option, and you can't use CardDAV on a pre-iOS 5 device ( http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4872 , http://support.google.com/mail/answer/2753077 ).\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I ended up using the iTunes sync feature ( http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1296 ) with Google Contacts.\nIt works pretty flawlessly, with the only (huge) downside that you can't sync without the PC.\n\nA: iOS can do it now.

(Bug?) Asked at Apple Discussions but the silence is deafening... \nI'm using two 2TB internal drives in tandem for Time Machine and deleted some files while in Time Machine. They deleted from drive A, but drive B still has the files. Is there a way to delete these? I tried unmounting drive A in Disk Utility but then I can't enter Time Machine.\nI love the dual backups, but should I be able to do dual deletes of files/backups? I don't see a way to accomplishg this except to force Time Machine to do a backup, then delete the files again so it switches drives, but that seems a bit convoluted.\nIf one of you guru types has an answer I'd be most interested.\nThanks.\nMike\nMac Pro 3.1 8 Core ML.3\n\nA: I don't know if it has any caveats or risks, but you can also use bypass to delete files on backups:\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Helpers/bypass rm -rf /Volumes/*/Backups.backupdb/*/*/*/Users/$USER/Documents/folder\n", "Q: Duplex Scanning in OSX with non-duplex scanner with document feeder How can I scan a large double sided document with my scanner's document feeder? The scanner only can scan one side of the page. However, I am bulk scanning all my bills and tax forms and have several that are 10+ pages with text on both sides of the page.  \nIs there any stock software that will scan one side, prompt for you to flip the pages, scan the other side, and them output a single PDF file? Otherwise, I would need software to simply combine the two PDF files and properly order the pages.  \n\nA: There is also a free alternative with PDFSAM, that perfectly work on Sierra 10.12.4.\nYou can separately scan first odd pages (beginning with the first page) and then even pages (beginning from the last page). After that you can mix all together with the alternate mix option taking care of reverse the even page, as the following image:\n\n\nA: The \"fake duplex\" in PDF Scanner works very nicely. \nThe things I find frustrating are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Autocrop pages doesn't crop all pages in the batch the same.

Instead the video clip will just play one time from beginning to the end.\nIs it possible to export slides with looped video clips inside Keynote to a Quicktime movie?\n\nA: Interesting question. One would assume if you record the presentation of a Keynote, all visuals would be recorded. Turns out it’s not.\nI tried myself, and any Quicktime loop is only exported once. Bug? In the meantime, you could modify your Quicktime move to play several times in a row. \nYou can do this in Quicktime Player 7 (everyone should have it), by selecting all (CMD-A), copying to the clipboard (CMD-C) and then pressing paste (CMD-V) several times in a row.

Can I find out what is causing this? This has been happening for months, and I have no idea what's causing it.\nSomething on my Mac keeps mucking with disk permissions, and it seems like a trivial set of stuff\n\n\n*\n\n*Java-related library files and the Applet plugin\n\n*Core Graphics headers\n\n*Some network headers, like a few files in the arpanet group\n\n*My hosts file (in this case, I know that the thing touching the hosts file is the Gasmask application)\n\n\nHowever, whatever it is that is doing this, it completely wrenches up a lot of file-related actions.  The two most high-profile issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Archive Utility becomes unusable; it hangs indefinitely and I have to force-quit.  3rd party archive utilities like The Unarchiver don't experience this issue, so I've switched to using The Unarchiver.\n\n*The most annoying one is that the \"Reveal In Finder\" action in Alfred doesn't work.  I use this functionality all the time and it constantly stops working.\n\n\nIf there are other issues, I haven't directly noticed them, but I'm sure there are other things I can't find.  Whenever one of these things starts to happen, I run a permission repair, and everything goes back to normal for a little while, then one day *bang* it starts again.\nHas anybody else experienced something similar, or does anybody know if there's a way that I can track specific files' permissions modifications so I can see exactly what the culprit is?  I have a great deal of software installed via homebrew and non-MAS avenues so I think it'd be pretty complicated to track it down exactly, any tips are greatly welcomed.\n\nA: I don't know if the permission issues are related, but revealing files in Finder not working and Archive Utility stopping to respond are both symptoms of the Apple Events bug that was introduced in 10.8.2.\nI don't know if it was fixed in 10.8.3, but when that starts happening, you can terminate appleeventsd from Activity Monitor or with sudo killall -9 appleventsd (without -9 other processes stop responding for some reason).

I found my .MobileBackups folder quite large, it weighs 160 GiB. Shouldn't the .MobileBackups folder be wiped after the Time Machine 'backup session'? \nSince I have backup done on my external drive how can I get back my 160GiB of HDD space? Can I simply remove this folder or maybe set some limit of mobile backups? \n\nA: To disable local backups issue this command in terminal:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nThis almost never is necessary as the system will automatically prune and disable local backups as your drive fills. You can search for backupd using the console app to see if and when the storage cleanup happens due to low space.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion as to the purpose of local snapshots. It's not to take snapshots that then get dumped to your actual Time Machine drive when you run a backup, it's a separate set of snapshots that let you restore files you've accidentally changed or deleted, when you're away from your Time Machine drive. It's not a true backup -- it won't help you if your laptop's drive fails -- but it will help out if you're on the go and you accidentally lose something while on the go. As such, they don't get cleared out after TM backups.\nOn my computer (a Macbook Air with flash memory), it deletes old mobile snapshots after a week. The behavior may be different on devices with hard drives, as they don't experience longevity issues with full disks. According to Apple's documentation, they aren't deleted after a week. Note that the available space shown in Finder does not take into account the local snapshots, because they will automatically be deleted if you need the space, and it will automatically keep at least 20% of your disk space free -- so you generally shouldn't worry about space taken up by local snapshots.\nHowever, if you don't want them around, you can disable them with the command sudo tmutil disablelocal. This will free up the space taken by your local snapshots, and if you reenable it with sudo tmutil enablelocal, it'll start again with an empty set of local snapshots. So, a quick way of clearing out what's on there is to disable and re-enable local snapshots.\nYou can see how many old backups are being stored by activating Time Machine. White tick marks indicate local snapshots, and purple ones indicate real backups.\nThere's more information from apple and here.\n\nA: I'll add to this, since I had the issue of migrating data from a 1TB HDD to a 0.5TB SSD via Time Machine Restore. I had slimmed down the total data on the disk from ~730GB to ~350GB, but still was seeing that the Time Machine Backup was at the ~730GB size, due to the Mobile Backups.\nTurning Time Machine off will delete Mobile Backups, but that isn't done immediately (and can be confirmed in Disk Utility)—they are simply moved to the Trash to be deleted later (although you won't see them). Some would suggest the drastic measure of using this Terminal command:\n$ sudo rm -rf /.MobileBackups.trash\n\nI would only recommend this as a last-ditch effort. \nSince my data was backed up, I could try it, but was presented with permissions errors, presumably by the system as a type of safeguard. So, I stopped the process, and just did multiple system restarts.\nThis did the trick, and the space was freed up, allowing me to create a smaller Time Machine backup to restore to the smaller drive.\n\nA: This is a virtual folder. And displayed size is not actual, there is only changed files copied, but displayed total size of all data. Removing MobileBackups will not make 160 gb more free space.\nTo remove MobileBackups just make another Backup to external drive, it will move all data. You will get free space and more detailed backup on external drive.\n", "Q: Can I exclude itunes from the Software Update feature in system preference? I've reverted from 11 back to 10.7 three times by now because I keep forgetting to uncheck iTunes whenever it prompts me to install patches. I'd like to be able to tell the updater to skip over iTunes automatically.\n\nA: In the Software Update app, select the update and select Ignore Update... from the Update menu.\nIf you ever want to bring it back, select Reset Ignored Updates from the Software Update menu.\n", "Q: Isn't it redundant to have Versions as well as Time Machine? Versions and Time Machine seem to me to offer duplicated features: both do hourly backups, and their interfaces for browsing previous versions of files are very similar.  The only difference I can see is that Time Machine backs up all files regardless of whether their associated applications support the TM interface, so even if the app I use to view the file doesn't work in TM, I still have backups of my files - whereas Versions has to be supported directly by each application. \nI can understand having Versions' file and document versioning support there under the hood in order to enable multiple applications to open a single file without causing corruption - but why present this versioning system to the user when we already have Time Machine with the same features and a near-identical user interface?  Why use more disk space to provide the same feature twice?\nIs there a crucial feature or use case for either Versions or Time Machine which means it makes sense to have both?\n\nA: No it is not the same:\nVersions: It is for different versions of your documents. You change something in your document and you can revert to an earlier version. This is not possible with Time Machine in this granularity. \nTime Machine: It is for backup. It handle the case that you need to recover from a hard disk crash in your mac. You can't do that with versions since versions saves your changes on the then defect hard disk. \nSo they have their purpose since they „solve“ different problems.\n\nA: Certainly not. Consider what you need Versions/Time Machine for, before deciding which is redundant.\nIf you're constantly deleting files and needing them later, or if you like that sense of security in the back of your head, then no, Time Machine isn't redundant.\nBut if you don't feel that way, and you don't really delete files that often, then it may be redundant.\nAlso consider: if your computer were to break down someday, would you need a backup?\nVersions saves versions of files as soon as you save them. That way, if you need to revert to a certain point in time of a file, then you can do that.\nTime Machine also provides this functionality, however not as flexibly. Time Machine saves backups on regular intervals, not as soon as you save files. However Time Machine can restore deleted files, as well as bring back your OS when it dies. In other words, Versions is a document reverting system whereas Time Machine is a backup solution.\nI actively use both systems, so no, it's not redundant to have Versions and Time Machine.\n", "Q: iBooks does not read modified epubs I recently modified several epubs. I just turned \"...\" ellipses into the \"…\" type. Calibre has no problem with the modified epubs, and Sigil validates them. They can be imported to iTunes, only the metadata gets a bit messed up, and sychronized to my iPad.\nBut on the iPad, iBooks will throw these files out of its library. What is wrong? Is there some kind of hash value saved somewhere?\n\nA: I installed Stanza on the iPad and tried to load the epub files into that. It failed, but stated that container.xml was missing. That was the right clue: I had created zip files from the modified text files that contained a directory, and that directory contained all the epub files: mimetype, META-INF with container.xml and OEBPS.\nRepacking the zip with the files at the root of the archive brought order & peace back.\nSo iBooks was right after all. I have to take a look at what Sigil validated…\n\nThe validator that Mark mentioned has been installed by the IDPF and is available on their web page for online usage. Sure enough, it mentions that container.xml and mimetype are missing. Strange that calibre and iTunes accepted these files.\n\nLast update: Sigil loads the malformed epub files, but saves them in the right format. I guess it validates the format stored in its memory.\n", "Q: How do I stop a deleted purchased apps from continously charging me? I bought this Starmaker app at the App Store for Iphone which cost me $1.79. I thought that I would be charged just one time. But every week, I have been getting email notifications that I am continously being charged $1.79 for each week. I deleted the app from my Iphone but they are still charging my credit card. How do I stop this? \n\nA: You should go to Apple Support and contact the iTunes team. They are the only ones who can fix this.\n\nA: It's likely you made an in-app purchase of some sort of subscription. To check and deactivate the subscription, manage you Apple ID account in iTunes by clicking View My Apple ID in the Store menu.\n\nEnter your password and on the resulting page you should see subscriptions listed under Settings with the number of subscriptions.\n\nClick on the Manage link to the right.

I am looking for an application that will save a copy of a photo on my camera at a smaller resolution. Can't find anything...thanks!\n\nA: Try this: Reduce - Batch Resize Images and Photos for iPhone & iPad.\nHowever, if you just want to reduce the photo uploading traffic, the iOS built-in Photo.app allows you to share the photos with size-reduced version.\n\nA: I have used \"MultiLoader\" to do something similar (ie, upload 15-20 pictures for a document); but, it is only effective if you have a WiFi connection.  It creates a mini web server on the iPhone, zips all the pictures together at full or 1/2 or 1/4 resolution, and lets you connect to download them.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wifi-photo-multiloader/id448314967\n\nA: I have used ImageOtim with some success.  Having said that it does not resize or reduce the resolution, it just compresses the images better, which might be enough for you or not -- in general I find that having better compressed larger images is easier for me than having not compressed small low res images. \n\nA: I have used an app called Resize Photo from the App Store.\nIt's Free, and that made up all the difference for me!\nWhen using it, you may even save in batch with all the photos the same resolution. This was a phone-saver when I found myself with over 600 photos and only 16 GB.\nHope this helps.\nNote: I am not in any way affiliated with the developer of this application, and am only stating my personal favorite application for resizing photos.\n\nA: Not free - Photoshop\nyou can do all of this quickly by doing it once while recording your actions, and exporting your actions as a droplet. A Droplet is essentially a self contained program that you drag image(s) to and it runs on them all.\nActions I'd suggest: Resize, Save For Web, Save As, Close Window, Do Not Save. \nI've done this in the past for hundreds of images at a time when converting them for web display- essentially you're doing the same thing, but with some personalized tweaks for your phone.\nIf you have Photoshop, give it a try... if not, don't buy it just for this one feature!\n", "Q: How can I insert an image in Keynote 09 that retains a link to an external file?

I mostly use Google Voice so it's place to start. An App Store search on \"SMS\" returned 2776 iPad apps and 7914 iPhone apps so the hard part is that there's actually too many to choose from.\n", "Q: iPhone with external hard drive I see there have recently been several products released that offer to give an iOS device access to local mass storage on the order of terabytes via WiFi.

The new MagSafe for the current Macbook Air isn't very strong for its magnetic force, so it can become loose easily.  Today I left the Macbook Air unplugged and it went into sleep, and after I plugged in the MagSafe and moved the Macbook Air 2, 3 feet, the MagSafe became loose again, while the computer is \"wakening from sleep\", and I immediately plugged in the MagSafe but the computer seemed to \"go to sleep right away\".\nAt this point, when I press the Power button, it won't start up.  I pressed it for 2 seconds, 3 seconds, and it won't start up.  I waited for 30 seconds and tried, and then 1 minute and tried and it won't start up.  I had to press the Power button for 5, 6 seconds or more, and then it rebooted.  So the OS, all the apps were stopped abruptly as if it were a power outage.  I really doesn't hope that it would happen, as any app that created temporary cache files won't get cleaned up, and will waste the hard drive space, and in general I just don't like the computer being shut down this way, as if the power plug is just pulled like on a desktop computer.\nIs there a way to avoid this, or maybe the OS can be fixed so that it won't \"wake up and go to sleep right away and crash\".  One possibility I can think of is set the computer to sleep not when the power is at 1% or 2%, but at 3% or 5%, and somehow set the computer not to sleep right away once it got waken up, at least for a minute, if the user plugs in the MagSafe and it became loose for a few second seconds again.\n(one way is just to make sure after the MagSafe is plugged in, it won't got loose for at least for 1, 2, or a few minutes, so that if the MagSafe became loose, the power already got increased so the computer won't to sleep, or even if it goes to sleep, it has enough power to do so, so that the whole system won't crash.  But it would be better if the computer can handle it even when the user doesn't take this extra precaution.)\n\nA: If the battery is drained and you cut the power source, it effectively is a power outage. The only way to avoid this is by not disconnecting the charger while the battery is empty, or by not letting the battery drain completely.\n", "Q: iPod volume control problems I recently purchased an apple iPod touch 4th gen but the volume control has been stuck at the max and will start going up or down at any random time The up button doesn't work and the down volume will turn it down but it will go right back up. I've tried turning it on and off but to no avail.\nHow can I get my volume control back?\n\nA: If your volume control adjusts itself after you restore the device to factory settings, it's likely a hardware error in a button or the headphone jack.\nTherefore the steps to fix this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your device\n\n*Restore the device\n\n*Take it in for service (assuming the issue doesn't resolve itself)\n\n", "Q: How do I maintain two different iOS devices on a single iMac My wife and I share an iMac, and our iPhones keep populating with each other's apps. iTunes keeps trying to update my phone with my wife's apps and data.

You'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iTunes\n\n*Hold down the Option key and then launch iTunes\n\n*Click the \"Create Library...\" button on the dialog that is displayed\n\n*Once you've created the different libraries, you need to remember to use the Option key and then \"Choose Library...\" to switch between the two every time you start iTunes\n\n\nA multi-part tutorial can be found here.\n", "Q: Policy on users of Internet sharing on Mac OS X Mountain Lion I have an ADSL Modem directly connected to my Mac 10.8.2 in bridge mode, the PPPoE connection is initiated by Mac and internet is shared to user computers / mobiles using WiFi.\nQuestion:\nCan i limit the speed of a specific IP / Mac address or other restrictions like blocking website ?\nRegards\n\nA: There is not a decent way to do this using OS X's Internet Sharing feature. It is not designed to be a fully-fledged router. I recommend that you purchase an inexpensive router that is capable of 802.11n and WPA2 encryption and use this to share to all devices on your network.

It's only the power supply which is broken but Apple can't fix it they tell me in an Apple Store. A little ridicolous, but anyway...  \nI like to use a normal USB HDD to do my backups now and I like to plug that into my router so I can do it via WiFi. Problem: My router (and a short research of mine says it is not only my router) is not able to deal with Mac OS Extended format. He only recognizes FAT and NTSF. Time Machine however always asks to reformat the HDD to Mac OS Extended. I read an article about how to deal with that but it is kinda out of date and didn't work under Mountain Lion. So my question:  \nIs there a way of getting Time Machine using a FAT formatted HDD to make backups on?\n\nA: Time Capsule (networked Time Machine) relies on the share being AFP.  If you can get your router to share the file via AFP everything should work.  My guess is that that will take quite a bit of work though.  You might start with DD-WRT.\n", "Q: How do I get the terminals in terminal.app to go to the right directory after restart with tcsh?

I keep getting 'system not responding' errors in the applications I am using on the remote PC, even though when I am onsite I never get them. It's making things pretty hard work as I'm essentially locked out of the application for anywhere between 10-30 seconds at a time.

This is why people run to Pirate Bay. Any solutions welcome :)\n\nA: If Windows 8 has been released in your country, you should be able to find a reseller with the System Builder version available as a DVD. Local system builders is a pretty big business in most countries so just look around for someone offering custom built Windows systems.  A quick Google search on \"create a DVD ISO on OS X\" shows lots of how-to articles for that step.\nYou can either use an external DVD reader (maybe $30) or get somebody with a DVD to create the ISO for you.\n", "Q: How to right-drag using trackpad only, for Windows on MacBook Is there ANY way -- either from Apple or via third party utility software -- to enable the built-in TrackPad on a MacBook Pro laptop to do a real \"right-click drag\" function?\nNote I'm asking for right-dragging NOT \"right clicking\" -- this is where, under Windows, you click the right mouse button while pointing at something, HOLD DOWN the right mouse button and DRAG the object somewhere, THEN let the right mouse button go, and usually a menu pops up at that point, to allow you to choose what you want to do with the thing you're dragging (a file or icon or whatever).\nThis function, right-click dragging, is actually quite useful and a real time-saver that my fingers muscle-memory is pretty much coded to do A LOT, while I'm working in several different software products under Windows.\nMoving to a MacBook (with Windows running in emulation, via VirtualBox) has a lot of great benefits for me, BUT having to give up right-dragging is kind of almost turning into a total deal-breaker for this effort, to move to a MacBook.\nAlso I know I could just plug in a mouse, but really would prefer to get this working with the great Apple TrackPad IF at all possible!!  The trackpad is an amazing piece of tech and I cannot believe that I'm really the first person to notice this HUGE oversight of the missing right-drag functionality.\nI'd have thought this would have been fixed already AGES ago, what with Apple's otherwise stellar support of Windows on Mac hardware.\nThere HAS to be a solution for this...\n==============\nUPDATE - EDIT\nHi guys, thanks for comments.  I realize it's not \"Mac Like\" to do this, but I don't want it for OSX, I only want it to work for WINDOWS.  (Shouldn't Windows running on Mac still work in a \"Windows-Like\" way, IF Apple's goal is to really fully support running Windows on Apple hardware?)\nMy goal is to have both OS running side by side (not via Boot Camp, I want the Win setup to be virtualized and keep it a finger flick away, on it's own Spaces desktop) so that I can keep using all my old Win software while moving into the Mac world in the future.  Best of both worlds... in theory.\nI've already enabled lower-right TrackPad corner click as right-click, but it doesn't work for this right-click-dragging.  Any clicking automatically finishes when you click, it doesn't appear to support HOLDING DOWN the click, so you cannot DRAG before letting the right-click back UP again.\nAgain, this all DOES apparently work fine IF you have an external, two-button mouse connected.  So it shouldn't really be impossible, it just needs the software to better understand what's being done with the TrackPad!\nI'd be happy even if some alternative \"gesture\" could be defined for this, on the Mac's TrackPad.  I've looked at a couple apps so far (Better Touch Tool, etc) but nothing yet seems to work.  Seems like the issue (as noted above) must be something to do with software understanding of the \"holding down\" of the right-click.\nAlso does anyone know if maybe this has been solved in either of the commercial VM programs (Parallels or VMware)?  Rather than using the free VirtualBox, I'd be willing to buy something to get this functionality working correctly on Windows the way I want it to work...\n\nA: You can do this on the Macbook Pro trackpad by pressing down with two fingers hard enough to engage the mechanical \"mouse\" button built in to the trackpad.  Drag your item(s) to the desired destination and then release the pressure off the button and... voila!  Windows will display the right drag menu at that point.\nUnfortunately this doesn't allow \"locked drags\" where you can continue dragging long distances by picking your fingers up off the trackpad surface and quickly repositioning them to continue the drag.\n\nA: Since right-click in Mac OS X trackpad is done through two-fingers clicking, what you're asking is pretty non-Macish. On OS X, if you two-fingers click and drag, only the first two-fingers click is perceived by the OS, which pops up the option menu instantaneously.\nThere seem to be nothing also in VirtualBox preferences. VirtualBox (as well as other similar software - Parallels) treat the trackpad in an OS X way: for example, in a virtualized Linux I scroll down a page using the classic Mac two-fingers scroll; this is done in order to standardize the behavior of your trackpad.\nIf you're fond of Windows, give a chance to Bootcamp and see if in a native environment you can find a proper solution.\n\nA: Try touching 3 fingers down, keep one down, let up the second, and drag with the third.\n\nA: For any gamers out there who reach this question looking to rotate the camera in 3D strategy games ported to Mac. whatyouhide's answer above is correct, but just to clarify further a bit:\n\n*\n\n*Two finger click (not tap).\n\n*Lift one finger and release pressure.\n\n*Drag single finger - game picks it up as a right click drag.\n\nAt least this is how it worked in Stellaris.\n\nA: As far as I can tell this is definitely a possibility if you were to use Windows via Boot Camp, as you have an option in the settings of its control panel.\nAs you want to achieve this via virtualisation software and I cannot guarantee but take a look at Synaptics Gesture Suite™ Windows 8 for TouchPad™\nhttp://www.synaptics.com/solutions/technology/windows8\nIt may or may not prove fruitful.\n\nA: I need to right drag to orbit the view in my Windows-only 3D modeling software.  The following solution worked for me.\nRemap the Right Command Key to Right Click on a MacBook Pro\nGranted it is not a trackpad-only solution, but it feels pretty natural.\nHint: if you don't want to log in to WikiHow, Google the above link text and use the arrow under the link to pull up Google's cached version.\n", "Q: drop of water on mousepad of macbook pro and now the mouse is being odd? I had wet hair and some drops of water landed on my trackpad. It happened on last friday or thursday, so like 4 or so days ago. And basically now my mouse will just randomly click on stuff and right click too and for the first couple hours I couldn't use it and I wasn't able to get it to work except for the top portion of the mousepad. and now It's no longer that bad, but it still randomly clicks and moves around. should I take it to a genius bar or do you think it'll just eventually stop? any help would be really appreciated and sorry I know this has probably been asked a hundred times.\n\nA: This sounds like you may have liquid damage to the system. If this is the case, the issues won't just go away. Water-based liquids are very corrosive to electronics and the damage cannot undo itself. However, you can certainly take it to the Genius Bar. However, I wouldn't mention the water droplets to them. If they can't visibly see the liquid damage and can confirm the issue (and provided you are under warranty), they may replace the trackpad piece free of charge.\n", "Q: open iTerm drop down console on different screen I use iTerm since a few days, and when i press my hotkey, it'll drop down nicely, from top of the screen, but ... on the wrong one.\nI have a macbook pro with mountain lion, and i connect it to a 24\" screen for development.

I use match frequently, and I notice that from time to time it will completely fill up the space on my iphone. This tends to cause the phone to run very slowly until I delete some items off of the phone. I would like to limit the space of match on my phone so that it will never fill it up. Is this possible?\n\nA: This is not possible. iTunes Match will continue to fill up your storage space as you download tracks locally on the phone through it. I believe it will trim songs once the space is full, to clear off the least-played material.\nIf you would like, you can manage your storage in a few ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Usage > Music. Here you can clear all downloaded music.\n\n*Go to the Music app. Locate downloaded material and swipe across artists, albums or songs to remove them from your local storage.\n\n\nA: It looks like I MAY have finally worked this out. What has fixed it (for now) for me, and doesn't seem to have been mentioned before, is the button for Settings... on iTunes on my Mac, when my iPhone is connected, next to the Autofill button.\nConnect your iPhone to your Mac, and click on the icon for the phone. Click on Music on the On My Device menu on the left. Click on Settings... and set the Reserve space for disk use slider right to the right hand side - so that you essentially are saying you're making no space available for music actually ON your device. Click OK.\nI did the above, and set off iTunes to prepare a new iCloud Music Library. Once it had done so (24,000 songs), I connected my phone, which was empty of music. On the iPhone, I set the switch for iCloud Music Library ON...it scanned and presented the library, but actually downloaded nothing to my iPhone. It didn't even attempt to.\nThis has been a real struggle for the last few weeks, but hopefully this has fixed it.

However, if a message recipient is using standard SMS (such as a user on an Android, etc.), their response will be a standard SMS message back to you.\nSo if you want a true group message, ensure everyone is using a Mac or iOS device, with iCloud and iMessage enabled. If you are in a mixed environment with non-iOS users, you might look at a third-party messaging app that works on all platforms.\n", "Q: wifi.log disappeared?

It will also be transferred within your finder structure to a new artist folder that's called \"alan smithees iPhone 5\" or whatever and will not be included in your synched voicemail anymore.\n\nA: With iOS 14.4 (the one I have today):\nTap the Edit button on top right corner and scroll through all the recording's selection circles, then after having all recordings selected tap Delete on right corner right corner.\nIt's not as fast as a 'delete all' option but it think it scales well enough with hundreds of recordings as you keep your finger on the bottom left corner for continuous scrolling.\n", "Q: How accurate is System Report on RAM speed? I have successfully replaced 2 * 4GB DDR3 1333 MHz RAM (Samsung) with 2 * 8GB DDR3 1600 MHz RAM (CnMemory). Everything runs fine and System Report is displaying the RAM is running at 1600 MHz.\nNow I wonder how accurate this report is. I have learned the RAM clock rate is determined by the Front Side Bus (FSB), so I would have expected the new RAM to still work at 1333 MHz instead of now 1600 MHz.\nSo does System Report report the accurate clock rate of the FSB or does it report the advertised maximum clock rate from the DDR3 RAM somehow?\n(I should have done a memory benchmark before the switch, but I really didn't expect these better results).\n\nA: This depends mostly on the capabilities of the FSB and the RAM itself.  If, for example, you install a 1600 MHz stick next to a 1333 MHz chip, most FSBs will time at 1333 for both, if it is even capable of doing so.  Most FSBs also have a maximum clock speed as you indicated in the comments. \nThe FSB is not likely fudging the numbers.  There is a chance the 'limit' imposed by KB HT1270 is a soft one.  Though my 2008 MBP had a limit of 2x2GB I ran it for years with 2x4GB sticks.  I couldn't say for certain regarding your specific model, but I'm inclined to disregard this list.  \nDon't go crazy though, there are some hard limits on the size that will be accommodated, which you've likely reached with your 16GB.\nAdditionally, in my experience, transitioning from 1333 to 1600 typically doesn't produce noticeable speed increases, though the doubling of the capacity would.  If you're noticing this under moderate load with no paging, it's likely the effects are psychosomatic. :)\n\nA: I have the same machine (MacBookPro8,2). A quick web search seems to indicate that my 2.2 GHz model has an Intel Core i7 2720QM CPU.\nAccording to Intel's specifications for this CPU family, the supported memory types are actually DDR3-1066/1333/1600. (Incidentally, the memory limit is also 32 GB, but this may require more than two slots; I'm not sure.)\nTechnically, this CPU doesn't have a traditional \"front side bus\", which is a connection between the CPU and an external memory controller. Its memory controller is integrated with the CPU, meaning that the supported RAM configuration isn't further subject to the specifications of an external memory controller.\nSo, it does seem like this system plausibly supports 1600 MHz RAM, after all! I'll be sure to keep that in mind when I upgrade to 16 GB. :)\n\nInterestingly, when I open the same dialog in \"About This Mac\", my system reports that it supports 1333 MHz memory. It seems like it might just report the current memory speed.\n", "Q: HomeSync / Mobile - Settings & keychain missing I've recently rolled out an Open Directory domain in our office. The domain has been set up so user profiles are synced with the server via HomeSync, so we could use FileVault2 to encrypt the machines.\nI recently got a new workstation and connected it to our domain. Upon logging in using my network account, I found that none of my settings or keychain were there. Thinking the settings sync might be a feature of HomeSync, I imported our workgroup profile which has HomeSync enabled on it. When logging back into the machine, HomeSync did it's thing and copied my user profile to the local machine but it wasn't until I logged in that I realised that my settings and my keychain STILL hadn't copied over.\nIs there something I need to do to ensure that settings centralised for each user?\nServer and clients are running 10.8\n\nA: Despite the ~/Library folder being in the configuration, it still wasn't being backed up.

My son and husband share the same Apple ID and have all the same media on both iPhones (games, itunes) etc.  We are now experiencing a problem where my son receives all my husbands sent and received text messages through iMessage.  I was told to change the Apple ID on my son's phone to his own so he would no longer be receiving the messages.  When I change the ID, will he lose all of his iTunes?  That is his greatest concern.  Thanks.\n\nA: The good news is that iOS allows you to have a separate iMessage Apple ID then your iTunes store Apple ID. To remedy your problem follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app (on your son's device) and go to \"Messages\".\n\n*Scroll and tap on \"Send & Receive\"\n\n*At the top select \"Use your Apple ID for iMessage\".\n\n*Tap \"Create new Apple ID\".\n\n*Enter in the information and follow the prompts.\n\n\nAfter this is done, you can go to Settings.app -> iTunes & App Stores, and make sure the Apple ID there is set to your Apple ID.\nAnd, to firmly answer your question: No, having a separate Apple ID for iMessage and iTunes (and the process of changing it) will not erase content.\nNote: instructions provided work best with iOS 6, but should be workable with iOS 5.\n", "Q: Difference between GSM and Global iPhone 5 I want to download iPhone firmware, but I don't know my iPhone is Global or GSM so…\nWhat is difference between \"iPhone 5 (Global)\" and \"iPhone 5 (GSM)\"?\nHow can I recognize if my iPhone is Global or GSM?\n\nA: The CDMA model presumably has compatibility in more markets than the standard GSM model.  According tot he list below, unless you ordered your phone from a Chinese firm, if you have a CDMA model it also supports GSM.  \nGSM is a European standard and supports the EDGE network.  CDMA supports some networks branded as \"3G\", but YMMV.

Here are the relevant iPhone 5 data:\n\n\n*\n\n*GSM models: A1428, A1533 and A1530\n\n*CDMA models: A1429 and A1453\n\n*CDMA China models: A1528, A1530 and A1518\n\n", "Q: How is my iPod Touch able to determine my location when I'm offline? When I'm traveling through a city, as long as there are wifi networks nearby (even if they are secured with a password), my iPod Touch can determine my current location with great accuracy—obviously not as well as a GPS can in the iPhone, but still very well.\nHow is it able to do this exactly? Could someone explain the technical side of this, or does anyone actually know how this works?\n\nA: Apple uses WiFi hotspots (and presumably the corresponding signal strength) to triangulate your position using a data from Apple.  Similar to how Google maps a hotspot using their StreetView cars, a 3rd party at one time scanned the area you travelled to and mapped the SSID and probably MAC address of the local hotspots.\nThough I don't know if they still do, Apple at one time did not maintain this information internally but sourced it from a 3rd party.  Some of the initial privacy concerns about iOS regarded how this information was 'phoned home' to Apple without consent;  That is, when your iPod was connected and 'knew' its location, it would also scan the local SSIDs and send them to Apple to improve/update the database.\nThis data was sourced by Skyhook Wireless.\nBased on my own inference from experience (though not 100% sure, and I no longer use an iPod, so even if this was true at one time it may not anymore be so), when you map a route in Maps, it caches the relevant SSID information for the areas to which you are travelling before it goes offline.\n\nA: Before you leave for your trip you'll need to install an offline mapping app like \"CityMaps2Go\". You need offline maps because you will not actually be connecting to the internet while you are doing your sightseeing.\nWhen you arrive in a new city you'll have to find a hotpot (hotel, Mcdonalds, Starbucks etc) and connect to the internet. This is the one and only time you need an internet connection.\nOpen either the built-in Apple \"Map\" app, or the Google Maps app, and open-up the \"directions\" option. Now enter any two points in the city, like from the train station to your hotel, or between any other two points of interest. \nAfter the app gives you directions the device will automatically load a database (from Apple) of all Wifi hotpots in the entire city! That database will now reside in the memory of the iPod Touch even after you exit Google Maps, and until you reboot the device. Any other app that uses the location service can now access that database.\nAt this point you no longer need to be connected to the internet, but the device must still be in Wifi mode. As you are walking around the city the device will be detecting Wifi hotpots (but not connecting to them), the device reads the hotpot's MAC serial number and in the background looks up the hotspot's coordinates off the database, and is able to determine and show your exact location anywhere you are in the city with an offline map app like CityMaps2Go.\nI've now used this feature successfully in Budapest, London, the Big Apple, Toronto, Amsterdam, Beijing and Hamburg. It's very accurate, determines your location in milliseconds, and I haven't come across in gaps in coverage.\n", "Q: Separating contacts My wife has a iPhone 5 and a iPad 2.  After she received her iPhone 5, I took over using her old iPhone 4 and also have a MacBook.  We share one Apple ID, therefore we share all contacts.

Apple kindly replaced the out of warrenty device.)  \nNow I have a new iPhone 4 but want to do things right this time and separate contacts. How can I do this?\n\nA: In order to do this, you must collaborate iTunes Apple IDs, but split off iCloud accounts. For you, it sounds like sticking with iCloud contact syncing will be good so that you (and your wife) will have your contacts synced across multiple devices.\nFirst you must decide who will stay on the \"primary\" account - this is the account that you already have. The other user (probably you), will setup a new account for iCloud. \nGo to https://appleid.apple.com/ and get a new Apple ID. Next, on your iPhone, go to Settings.app -> iCloud. Scroll to the bottom and select \"Delete Account\". Don't worry, it's basically just signing out of the account on your device. When prompted with the contacts, select \"Keep on my iPhone\" (very important). \nAfter \"signing out\", sign in with your new Apple ID. You may need to change accounts on your Macbook as well so that contacts are synced over. After you are signed into the new iCloud account, go to Settings.app -> iTunes & App Stores, and make sure you are signed into the old (your wife's, or the \"primary\" account) account. This way, you can make purchases with the same credit card, and you can perform updates on apps. \nIf you wish to share calendars, you will probably be best off using Gmail for that. Unfortunately, sharing reminders and notes won't be possible with the new setup.\n\nA: We found that the best way to do this was to create three separate iCloud accounts - 'his', 'hers' and 'joint'. As iCloud accounts are free, there's no costs. \nThe joint account allows you the flexibility to share contacts, calendars, documents, iTunes Match, Photo Stream, etc.\nAs an example, my iPhone has mine, my wife's, son's, daughter's and 'house' accounts all configured. Obviously, they all trust me not to read their email, etc (or reply on their behalf >:-} ), but we found this to be invaluable rather than using 'Share my Contacts', etc. \n", "Q: HP P4515 printer in 10.7.4 - what driver? HP's official support page lists the Laserjet P4515 as a compatible printer in 10.7 using the HP Print Software from Apple (per http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01664444&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en#N2473). However, the P4515 is not listed in my available printer software when installing a new printer.\nIs there a different driver name I should be using which also matches the HP P4515 model?\n\nA: It appears HP supports this printer with the P4014 series drivers.

(Current models.) Does the headphone jack support digital audio output or not)?\nWhich is the provides the best sound quality the USB,  Thunderbolt, digital socket or perhaps Mini DisplayPort from the Mac of the Mac? and how does that compare with the output of the iPhone/iPod/iPad?\nPlease note this is actually two questions in one. I both ask about the output of the Mac(Book)s and iOS devices, respectively. Current models.\n[For my question not to sound too subjective, I ask about natural, neutral sound.]\nMore info: NwAvGuy: Headphone & Amp Impedance (Basically he argues less - near zero - impedance is better.)\n\nA: I am not an audiophile so I can't answer your subjective quality question (which is better-sounding).  But I can tell you that the headphone jack on your MacBook does include optical audio in a format called mini-TOSLINK, which you will need an adapter to get in a standard TOSLINK.\nI have never had an audio quality issue with the standard copper-line devices I've plugged into my MacBook or iPhone or iPod.  My experience with outputting to TOSLINK extends only to sound systems which are a bit more dependant on the quality of the speakers, so I doubt the optical connector would be to blame with that.\nIf you are working with video, you may want to avoid TOSLINK as it apparently adds a bit of delay, but if you follow your \"reduce impedance\" rule, TOSLINK is probably the way to go.  Everything here is going to go through some digital stage of encoding, but TOSLINK avoids the wire, reducing radio interference and providing enough bandwidth that you can probably live with whatever or lossless (or near lossless) encoding is done.\n", "Q: Using Siri for commercial purposes? Does anyone know what the rules are on using Siri for unintended purposes?  I would like to actually hook it up to my company's phone number so that when someone calls in, I can have them routed to Siri.\nQuestions of how this would work technically aside, are there any Apple terms-of-use that say this isn't allowed?\n\nA: Since Apple doesn't offer an API to use their Siri services, you might be limited to coming up with some Rube Goldberg machine that presses the home button of your iPhone and rubs a buddha belly for luck (or whatever else you desire to have happen simultaneously with the incoming call) so that Siri will work at the exact moment your caller is speaking to her.\nAgain, there is no API to do anything except listen to what Siri responds sonically so it's not clear how this might be useful for anything but a fun youtube video.\nNow, your business might very well be able to license a voice like Siri (or the same exact voice for enough $$) by contacting Nuance or some other computer speech vendor - but their product likely won't run on iOS since other custom hardware is likely to be more capable for an automated PBX.\n", "Q: I need to restore my data from a non time machine manual backup My machine crashed and I made a manual backup to an external drive...how can i restore all my user data including mailbox data...am I screwed.

Today I put some music back on (this is iOS 5.1.1 now) and while the music player works, as soon as I close it the music stops (I say 'stops' rather than 'pauses' because using the play button in the multitasking tray starts the song from the beginning as if the Music app hadn't been running.\nThis does not happen when playing music from other apps such as Dropbox.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Here are the things you will want to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force the Music app to close.\n\n*Restart your device.\n\n*Update to the latest iOS version.\nI do not recommend that you close every single app in the multitasking bar. Simply restarting will have the same effect on system resources and is much less inconvenient.\n\nA: It may have something to do with there not being enough memory and the Music app trying to accommodate for that by stopping the music the moment you exit it. \nWhile normally you don't have to worry about closing individual apps that are in the app tray, for debugging this issue, I would recommend that close every app that is in the app launcher, then restart the iPad. Once it is restarted, launch only the music app and play the music. Then try going back to the home screen and see if you get different results. There is a possibility that one of the apps you have is misbehaving, and using excess amounts of memory even while it is closed. I have seen this happen many times.\n\nA: Okay, I have found the problem, it was my own stupid fault and I can't believe I didn't realise earlier. I had installed Backgrounder, a Cydia app to control multitasking, and something in its settings must have had Music terminate on close.

I bought a Macbook Pro Late 2011 and the previous owner didn't do a fresh install.\nSo I booted from the recovery partition, Disk Utility, erased the Macintosh HD and went to \"Reinstall OS X Lion\". The problem is I thought the recovery HD actually had the OS image, but it seems it doesn't. So it's downloading it but it says 43 hours remaining... (and the last time I tried it went to 50% and then said \"couldn't download additional components\" and I had to start over...)\nI've Googled a lot and I saw it's possible to put Lion on a USB stick.

I don't want to use illegal images...\n\nA: Your option is to continue letting it download. Apple does give the installer file, through Recovery Mode.\nIt sounds like you have an exceptionally slow Internet connection. I recommend that you do this somewhere with a better connection.\n\nA: OSX Lion file size is 3.5 Gig! \nSo your Download speed is about 120kbps :(. \nIf you do not have the luxury of 1Mbps or more!\nTurn off all other applications that use internet bandwidth. \nInclusive all background applications. \nDo it overnight when the servers are not so bussy.\nFYI: with 1 Mbps it will take about 7 hours.\nI usually go to a friend who has a 100 Mbps (100Base-T) and it takes 4 minutes for the same, well worth the trip and the six pack.\n\nA: Lion Disk Maker is an application programmed with AppleScript that you can use with Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7 and OS X 10.8 to burn a DVD or build a bootable drive from Mac OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion Installation program.

Apparently the page was not requesting sign-in information and restarts wouldn't fix it. What eventually worked was to go to a page in the app store that required a sign-in, like wish-list, then sign-in on the update page. This last step had no effect until I restarted and visited the update screen, then I was prompted and the updates completed. So in short, get the update screen to prompt you for a sign-in.\n\nA: I had this problem in the past when my iPhone 4 was jailbroken as well.\nI believe that it has something to do with the apple ID used to download the app. Try logging out of the apple ID (within the App Store, usually found at the bottom of the featured apps list), hard restart your device (holding down both sleep and home until device turns off), and sign back in to your ID in the App Store.\nTest drive it at that point by installing (or updating) a few apps.\nLet me know if this worked. Good luck to ya.\n\nA: I solved this problem by syncing to iTunes and downloading the app directly from my desktop iTunes. \n", "Q: Do any OS X twitter apps integrate well with Notification Center? I'm looking for an app to let me keep the twitter integration from OS X (where I can tweet from Notification Center (hereafter abbreviated NC)) but also have my mentions from NC open in the app as opposed to opening Safari or another web browser.\nI'm afraid the answer is no app can register/snatch the system twitter notifications intercept Notification Center links in a stand alone app rather than Safari, but I'm going to ask in case this is possible.\nEven if I have to turn off the OS X twitter notification in system preferences  or log out entirely to achieve this goal, do any OS X twitter clients integrate well with notification center for either DM or mention notifications?\n\nA: Tweetbot supports the Notification Center and adds clickable notifications that open in the app itself.\n\nIt does not intercept the standard Twitter notifications Mountain Lion added though, but as you mentioned, you can disable those to only see the Tweetbot ones. You can still tweet from the Notification Center after disabling standard Twitter notifications.\n\n", "Q: How to use F1-F12 keys with MacBook? Blender requires F-keys such as F12 and numpad. The numpad emulation works for me, but I am unable to get the function keys such as F1, F4 and F12 working. For example, F12 should do rendering. So how can I use Blender with a MacBook?\n\nA: To clarify and expand on HHH's comments: in at least some recent versions of OS X, F8, F9, F10, and F12 are set by default as shortcuts to control Expose, Spaces, and Dashboard. Houbysoft's and L2G's solutions don't work in this case; holding fn activates Expose/etc, and checking \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" in System Preferences/Keyboard just means you get Expose from the unmodified function key instead of from fn + function key.\nThe solution is: in System Preferences/Keyboard, open the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, and find and uncheck the relevant shortcuts.\n\nA: To expand on @Robert's solution (which in turn expands on @houbysoft's solution), to get F11 and F12 to execute application-specific functions (such as using F12 to open the developer tools in Chrome), you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute @houbysoft's solution\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Go to Keyboard\n\n*Go to Shortcuts\n\n*Click on Mission Control\n\n*Uncheck \"Show Desktop\" and \"Show Dashboard\"\n\n\n\n\nA: You need to hold down the fn key (lower-left corner) while you're typing one of the F1–F12 keys. This is the norm for any app that uses F-keys, not just Blender.\n\nA: You have two options; either hold down fn as L2G suggested, or switch to the F1 etc. keys to work like that directly.\nThis can be setup in keyboard preferences here:\n\nIf you do that, F1 will work as the actual F1 key. If you want to use it for controlling the brightness, you'd hit fn with it.\n", "Q: Where does MplayerX keep its playback history?

Most tech news web sites publish stories a few days before upcoming Apple hardware/software announcment press events.\nHow do they know that there will be a press event?\nI couldn't find that information on Apples web site.\n\nA: Information about an invitation-only press event isn't posted to the Apple website in advance  Those who are invited to the press event receive email invitations; those who aren't invited just report that there is a press event because they've seen the reports elsewhere.  The announcements that are made at the invitation-only press event will be posted in a press release after the event.\nApple rarely announces hardware or software outside of invitation-only press events.  One exception is their annual Worldwide Developer Conference, which starts off with a keynote address that is attended both by the developers who paid for the conference, as well as invited members of the press.  This keynote address includes announcements of new hardware, software, and operating systems.  It is the only part of WWDC which is publicly available and not covered by a non-disclosure agreement.  \nApple will occasionally simply update a product with no event at all, such as the recent iPad update.  In this case, they simply drop a press release and let it make its way out into the world.\n\nA: I should imagine that they email a press release to their media contact list, which would be the normal procedure. There's no point in publicising a press-only event on their public website, which will only lead to disappointment.\n\nA: The information you are looking for can be found here: http://www.apple.com/pr/\nNote that they do have press information for other locals (the one above is US based).\n", "Q: Can I use iPhone 4 3G services outside of my native country?

Unfortunately, this failed because some folders are locked. \n\nA: The KB article HT5139 \"Restoring OS X Server from a Time Machine backup\" describes how to restore OS X Server (Mountain Lion) or Lion Server from a local Time Machine backup:\n\nThe steps to restore from a Time Machine backup depend on whether your\n  data was stored on the startup (boot) volume or a non-startup volume.\nImportant: When restoring, restore from a local Time Machine backup. If you try to restore from a network-based Time Machine\n  backup, not all settings will be restored correctly.\n(...)\nTime Machine is the native backup service for OS X Server. OS X Server\n  also includes a process called ServerBackup which works with Time\n  Machine. ServerBackup performs daily backups of Open Directory (if it\n  is enabled) and the Postgres databases used by the Calendar (or iCal),\n  Contacts (or Address Book), Profile Manager, and Wiki services. These\n  daily backups are included in the Time Machine backup of Lion Server.\n  ServerBackup also takes part in the restoration of server services,\n  running during the first startup after a server has been restored, and\n  restoring server services and databases into place after the server\n  has started up.\n\nFrom KB article HT5139:\nIf server data was on the startup disk proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your local Time Machine backup drive is connected.\n\n*Start up your server using OS X Recovery by holding down CommandR.\n\n*Select Restore from Time Machine Backup and follow the onscreen instructions for restoring the volume.\n\n\nOtherwise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your local Time Machine backup drive is connected.\n\n*Start up your server using OS X Recovery by holding down CommandR.\n\n*If your Time Machine drive is encrypted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility, then click Continue.\n\n*Control-click or right-click the Time Machine volume, then select \"Decrypt\".\n\n*Enter the volume password and click OK.\n\n*Create or make sure that you have a new service data volume that is large enough to store your previous data and has the same name as your previous service data volume. \nFor example, if your service data was stored on a 500 GB volume named \"DataHD\", make sure you have a new volume of at least 500 GB named \"DataHD\".\n\n*Quit Disk Utility.\n\n\n*From the Utilities menu, choose Terminal.\n\n*Enter the following command on one line. \nReplace Time Machine Backup Disk with the name of your Time Machine backup disk, servername with the name of your server, and Startup Volume Name with the name of your previous startup volume.\ncd /Volumes/Time Machine Backup Disk/Backups.backupdb/servername/Latest/Startup Volume Name/\n\n*Enter the following command on one line. Replace Service Data Volume with the name of your original (and future) service data volume.\n./usr/bin/tmutil restore -v ../Service Data Volume/* /Volumes/Service Data Volume\n\n*Quit Terminal.\n\n*If you also need to restore the startup volume, select \"Restore from Time Machine Backup\" and follow the onscreen instructions.\n\n\nI realize that you tried the first option and it failed with a model mismatch error. You may want to try the second option.\n", "Q: PageUp and PageDown keys for Irssi (IRC) in Macbook? I cannot find the keys on my mackbook. I need them to go page-up and page-down in irssi (IRC). I have tested the tips here but they do not work. They model some different Up/Down, not the traditional Up/Down as on larger keyboards.\nHow can I press PageUp and PageDown buttons with Macbook? Irssi is running behind ssh and GNU Screen with UTF8 support.\n\nA: It took me a while to guess that and I didn't find anything on Google, so at least, if somebody needs it, it's fn + Up/Down in iTerm 2. \n\nA: In Terminal, go to Preferences... > Profiles. Click your 'Default' profile or the one you're currently using. Click the 'Keyboard' tab. Click 'Use Option as meta key'. Now Option-P and Option-N will do page back and page up.\nControl-P and Control-N are view page up/down... so it's super nice.\n\nA: I'm using irssi within tmux on Yosemite. \nWhen using laptop keyboard (no number pad) this works: fn + shift + up/down \nor (mojave)\nfn + up/down \nWhen using a standard keyboard shift + page up/page down \n\nA: fn + shift + Up/Down\nIIRC in previous versions of Mac OS X (Lion or perhaps earlier), fn had to come first. But I just tested fn vs. shift first and neither had a different effect.\nThis may be Terminal.app specific, and may not work in iTerm 2. YMMV\n\nA: I'm using irssi on Mavericks. For me it was fn + shift+ Up/Down\n\nA: On El Capitan with standard keyboard I got just page up/page down buttons to work fine out of the box.\n", "Q: Shortcut to eject all external hard drives but not MobileBackups So far I've been using the following AppleScript to eject all external drives at once conveniently using a shortcut:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    eject (every disk)\nend tell\n\nThis script is is stored in /Library/Scripts and I have assigned a shortcut to trigger it in FastScripts.\nBut there's one problem.

Ctrl + Alt + Delete on Windows provides a variety of functions, the main one of interest being the Task Manager. Is there an equivalent keyboard shortcut & indeed Task Manager for carrying out such tasks as quitting an application that maybe \"hanging\" (amongst other things) for Apple Macs, or indeed anything similar ?\n\nA: To complete previous answers :\n\n\n*\n\n*The shortcut control-eject brings up the shutdown/reboot confirmation dialog (I use this a lot : you just have to type control-eject then enter to shutdown.

Thank you.\n\nA: You have to enable the Develop menu of Safari, then you can choose your user agent.\n\nA: There's a simpler way than clicking your way through pull down menus. I'm a big fan of key commands, so if you go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts pane, go to the App Shortcuts side menu item, pick Safari from a list of apps and then add a new short cut.\nUse this specific text: Safari iOS 7 — iPad and then set up a key command to bring up the iOS version of the website. My preference is to use command-options-shift-i to bring up the iOS version of the site and then if I want to toggle back I have another set up to trigger the menu text Safari 8.0.\nI find this particularly helpful for view sites that want to force you to use flash video (which I abhor and have disabled in the browser with plugins) to load HTML5 video. This is also good if you want to download video for later viewing when you may not have adequate internet access. It also lets you automatically cherry-pick the highest available resolution by default when you download.\nHopefully this helps.\n", "Q: Parallels doesn't recognize Windows 8 Bootcamp I just upgraded my OSX to 10.8.3 and installed Windows 8 via Bootcamp.\nFor some reasons Parallels (8.0.18354) doesn't recognize this Bootcamp partition.

Fortunately there are a couple of options.\nOne option is to select any songs you'd like to down-convert, right-click (or ctrl-click) the selection, and choose \"Create xxx Version\". This will re-encode the tracks based on the encoding options you have set within iTunes Preferences. Feel free to adjust these settings to the quality of your choice. Once they have finished converting, you may remove the higher-quality local copies. iTunes in the Cloud will retain the higher-rate 256kbps version, but your computer will now have a lower-quality version to playback from.\nYou can also remove local copies of songs entirely, by selecting them and pressing \"delete\". The songs will remain in your iTunes library as stream-able tracks through iTunes Match. Before doing this, though, I highly recommend backing up your entire library of songs to an external hard drive for safekeeping.\nHopefully between a combination of these two options you can reclaim much of your lost space.\n\nA: iTunes Match music is available in the iTunes+ format, which does not include DRM, and you can use the following menu to re-encode selected songs:\n\nAt this time there is not a way to force a specific version of a song to be uploaded to iTunes Match.\n", "Q: How to backup Airport Extreme USB drive with Time Machine I have a drive connected to the Airport Extreme using its USB cable. I want to back up this drive using Time Machine (or some other practical method, though I trust Time Machine more than other solutions.) \nUnlike most who have this kind of question, I do not want to backup my local machine to this drive.  I want to backup this drive, along with my machines local drives to my external drive using Time Machine.\nThere seems to be no good way to back up this drive, meaning all the data on the drive shared by the Airport is at risk if something happened to it.\nIn case anyone is unclear, I have 4 devices in this scenario, the Airport Extreme (AE), the USB drive connected to it (AE-USB), my local Macbook (MB) and the external drive connected to the MacBook (MBED).\nI want to store files on AE-USB, and I want those files to be backed up somewhere, preferably using MB's Time Machine which backs up the MB drives to MBED.  I want to back up AE-USB onto MBED so that if something happens to it, I can restore it from the locally connected drive MBED. \n\nA: Time Machine is only designed to backup internal and locally-attached drives. It cannot backup network-attached storage devices (such as the AE-USB). If you would like to backup this network drive you will need to look at another software solution capable of doing so. Some recommendations would include Carbon Copy Cloner and ChronoSync.\nAnother thing you can do is purchase an external hard drive capable of RAID 1 configuration. While this won't protect you from accidentally deleting a file, it will protect you from hard drive failure.\n\nA: All you have to do is manually copy your important drive to your macbook or other mac computer and when the time machine takes the backup it will be stored on two devices. You can then go back to your important drive and delete the data that you copied to your mac. This way you have more space and your data is still going to be stored on both devices.\n", "Q: Are the app store review guidelines under NDA?

I still couldn't get it to recognize my movies etc. This morning I tried to manually open one of the movies with Quicktime player and it says that it is not a movie file. HELP!!! This was days and days of work to transfer my DVD collection over.  \n\nA: The first recommendation is to run Disk Utility to repair the external drive. If it is a simple corruption Disk Utility can occasionally fix it.\nThe next step from that would be to run a higher-end data tree repair utility, such as Disk Warrior. This software costs a bit of money but is better at repairing serious directory structure issues such as this.\nYou could also attempt a software-based data recovery using a program like Data Rescue. This software is just a bit pricey though, and at some point you will want to consider how valuable this data is.

With Dropbox you can stream videos, photos, and even use it for storage. You get roughly 2 GB for free (more if you refer users), but if you need more space you can easily upgrade your account, for a fee, to the Pro version which provides much more storage.\n\nA: Synology NAS hardware offers this, take a look to the apps[1] I think it is what you are looking for.\n[1] Photo Station is the app: https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/5.2/multimedia\n", "Q: How to get iTunes to play an iPhone playlist automatically when connected to iPhone I have a habit of working/studying while listening to music. And since the Mac I am connected to at work doesn't have all the songs I want, I normally listen to the songs via iTunes from the iPhone Playlists option. \nFor this, everytime I connect my iPhone to the computer, iTunes detects it, then I have to manually goto the 'iPhone' button in the application, and then \"On my iPhone\", and then select the playlist, and play a song. \nIs there anyway of automating this process ?

I need a screenshot program that will freeze the current content (in my case, a streaming live lecture) and allow me to take a regional screenshot.  In other words, once I hit the screencapture shortcut, the streaming content should freeze at the current frame, allowing me to drag and select a region, the screenshot is saved, and then I can repeat as needed.  Without this feature, I may start a regional drag on a formula the speaker is showing, but in the meantime the speaker has moved on to another slide and I can't capture the info I need for my notes.\nThe only Mac program I've found that does this freeze before capture is Snapz Pro X.  The problem with this program is that the screen capture process is multiple steps and not built for rapid screen captures. The steps include typing the shortcut combo, mouse clicking from a number of available buttons to select the capture mode, moving or resizing the existing regional capture settings, and finally taking the screenshot by hitting return.  Unfortunately, there isn't a way to set in the preferences or custom shortcut combo to automatically do a regional snapshot.  Also, you also have to start from the last region you took -- so if you need to take a smaller region that is within the boundaries of the prior snap, you have to drag it out of the way first.\nAre there any programs besides Snapz Pro X that will allow a regional snap that freezes the current screen contents?\n\nA: Don't know any applications that do what you're after but here's a couple of alternative options for you.

It has the option to grab the current window (or selected region or entire screen). \n\n\n*\n\n*Choose the option you want\n\n*Make the screen ready (ie video playing)\n\n*Choose it with a click\nYou may be able to set this up as a keyboard shortcut under /system preferences/keyboard/keyboard shortcuts - I've not tried.\n\n\n\nI hope that helps!\n\nA: After looking at the options, I decided applescripting and automator might be the way to go.  I liked the idea of Gerry and bassplayer7 of taking a screenshot and then later crapping. I essentially automated this and it works pretty well.  I attached the applescript to an automator service and attached that to a keyboard shortcut.  The only problem is that the program I need to screen capture from won't allow me to run the keyboard shortcut for some reason (just get a plunk sound), although I can do a normal regional screenshot (command+shift+5).\nHere is the applescript:\non run {}\n    -- save a screenshot to the documents folder, then open in Preview\nset RandomName to random number from 1000000 to 9999999\nset picPath to ((POSIX path of (path to documents folder)) & RandomName & \".png\") as string\ndo shell script \"screencapture -tpng -P \" & quoted form of picPath\ntell application \"Finder\" to set theMovie to picPath\n-- now go fullscreen in Preview using keyboard shortcut\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Preview\"\n        keystroke \"f\" using {command down, shift down}\n    end tell\nend tell\n    -- screencapture region and save to clipboard, then close Preview\ndo shell script \"screencapture -i -c \" & quoted form of picPath\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Preview\"\n        keystroke \"w\" using {command down}\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n    -- go to evernote to paste the note\nset myAppName to \"Evernote\"\ntell application myAppName to activate\nend run\n\n\nA: You can use command+shift+3 to capture the entire screen quickly then crop later.\n", "Q: Where to configure the default user group for file/directory creation? I would like to configure the default group for any file or directory which is created by my user. I am not sure where to start. Could somebody point me the right direction? My user lives in Active Directory and by default I get the default AD group. I am wondering if I could override this behavior on my computer.\n[myuser::~]touch test_file\n[myuser::~]ls -alrth test_file\n-rw-r--r--  1 myuser  AD\\Domain Users     0B Mar 19 10:40 test_file\n\nA: I don't see a way to do this. Since network accounts have their groups managed by the network account server, it doesn't look like this can be overridden locally. And since the user is part of the network account server they are technically not part of a local user group.\nAs a test, I used Advanced Options to modify my network user to group 80 (local admins group). Upon reboot my user belonged to the AD group again.\nIf you want to change group ownership, you will probably need to use the chown user:group functionality in the Terminal on each file or folder you want to modify ownership permissions over.\nAnother option, of course, is to work off of a local user account and use your network credentials when accessing network resources. You will lose awesome things like single-sign-on though.\n", "Q: How can I play a .drv file I received several .drv files recorded from a security system's cameras. The disc provided to me includes a player called \"GenAVplayer.exe\" and a filed named \"player.bin\" which when expanded contains .dll files, I assume various codecs for the player. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can play these video clips on my Mac?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I would recommend either MPlayerX or VideoLAN. Both are freely downloadable and support a variety of audio and video codecs. If you're lucky one might just work!\n\nA: You could try running GenAVplayer in wine, and opening the files in that.\n", "Q: Emacs 24 with fullscreen? Is there a way to use Emacs 24 in fullscreen mode? The Emacs wiki seems to imply that it has been disabled, but that there are some workarounds / patches. \nIt doesn't have to be \"true\" full screen, but I like to work without having the OS menubar  on the top and launcher at the bottom.\nIn the end, it is not clear how I can implement these patches or workarounds, which one I should use and / or if I should just install emacs <= 23.3.\nMy current .emacs includes the following (which allows me to use F11 to toggle fullscreen under Emacs 23 in Linux)\n(defun fullscreen ()\n (interactive)\n (set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen\n              (if (frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen) nil 'fullboth))\n(progn\n  (if (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode -1))  ;; no toolbar\n  (menu-bar-mode -1) ;;no menubar\n  (scroll-bar-mode -1) ;; no scroll bar\n  )\n)\n\n(global-set-key [f11] 'fullscreen)\n\n\nA: If you use Yamamoto Mitsuharu's emacs-mac-port then true full-screen \"Just Works\" (and much else too).

Is there a way to use the back camera of an iPad Mini as a video camera, so that I can use it from Screenflow as an input video device ?\n\nA: I'm not aware of any software the directly captures the video from the camera, but like others have suggested you can capture the screen, which also works when the camera app is open, thus getting the camera video. After doing some research, it seems that you can record the screen right through Screenflow. Check out more about Screenflow screen recording here.\nThe next option, which is free, is to use the built in QuickTime application to record the screen of the iPhone. This can be done by\n\n\n*\n\n*Open QuickTime\n\n*File -> New Movie Recording\n\n*Next to the record button, click the down arrow to the right\n\n*Select iPad Mini\n\n*Open the camera app and press record in QuickTime\n\n\nThe downside to these two options are that you won't get the native resolution from the camera, instead it is being downscaled to fit the screen size. For both Screenflow and QuickTime, you must plug in your phone, but this will provide better quality screen recording than doing it over WiFi. Best of luck!\n\nA: This might be what you are looking for. http://www.reflectorapp.com/ It can capture the iOS view in a video.\n\nA: AirBeam is a paid app and it works really well for what  you're describing.  I've used it and can recommend.  iDevices can be a cam or a monitor and you can view over Wifi or 3G/LTE.  And of course OS X seamlessly blends in as a cam or monitor.  For example, place iPad in the location you want to monitor and Airbeam keeps the screen black and password protected, while you view from another location via macbook.  It's easy to add another iPod if you wanted to? Check it out. Airbeam is one of the better ones. \n\nA: This app works well: http://www.ipeekcam.com/\nNotes:\n1. You must use www in the url.\n2. You may need to restart your router to get it to work (that's what I needed to do).\n3. Free version has limited features (but works well).\n4. Use /videoView to view the video without other info on the page.\n", "Q: generate Keynote presentation from text or Markdown? Is there a way to automatically generate a Keynote presentation from a source file written in text format, Markdown format, or org-mode? \nI know that Pandoc and other tools can generate HTML-based slideshows from Markdown. But Keynote allows you to put all your speaker notes to yourself in \"Presenter View,\" which allows you to have a detailed view of your slideshow + notes on your laptop, and project a clean presentation that is not cluttered up with all your speaker notes. \n(Whereas with HTML presentations, since there's only one window, you either have to put your speaker notes in the presentation slide itself, or put your speaker notes elsewhere.) \nSo can I generate a Keynote presentation, or at least a barebones one with slide headlines, from another source?\nExample\n# A headline\n\n![some image](http://google.com/image.jpg)\n\nSome text here.\n\n# A headline\n\n![some image](http://google.com/image.jpg)\n\n- bullet point\n- bullet point\n\n# A headline\n\n![some image](http://google.com/image.jpg)\n\nSome text. \n\n> Speaker notes.\n\n\nA: md2key\nmd2key is exactly what you want. md2key is an open source tool for converting markdown to Keynote presentations.\nInstall\nInstall md2key with the command:\ngem install md2key\n\nUsage\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a keynote document\n\n*Create a first slide as a cover slide\n\n*Create a second slide to choose a slide layout\n\n*Then execute md2key markdown.md\n\n\nA: I don't know of any tools that convert from markdown to Keynote or Powerpoint.\nIf it is a simple presentation, that just consists of slides and bullet points, you can import it into Keynote by first converting it to an unordered list, with slide titles at the top level, e.g.,\n-   First Slide\n    -   Point 1\n    -   Point 2\n-   Second Slide\n    -   Point 1\n    -   Point 2\n\nThen convert this to docx using pandoc. Open the docx file in Pages. Meanwhile, open a new slideshow in Keynote, and go to Outline View. Copy the list from Pages to your clipboard. Right click on the little blue square in the outline pane in Keynote, and \"Paste and Match Style\".\nFor a more detailed explanation of those last steps, with screenshots, see http://www.peterstagg.com/welcome/apple-inc/creating-outlines-for-keynote-in-pages-and-textedit/.

Once converted, the PowerPoint can be previewed, emailed, printed or sent to another app (such as MS PowerPoint, Dropbox, Keynote, GoodReader, Evernote etc.)\n\n\nA: You could use Org Beamer mode to create the presentation, and then show PDFs instead of Keynote, or run PDF2Keynote to generate a Keynote from the PDFs.\n", "Q: How to make Mobile Safari open email links in the Gmail app? Is it possible to make a mobile Safari open email links directly to the native Gmail app, rather than open up to Apple's Mail.app?\n\nA: There is no way (yet) to change that without jailbreak tweak. Apple forces you to use Safari and (in this case also) Mail.app.\nYou can find the tweak here: http://www.webpronews.com/jailbreak-tweak-lets-you-make-chrome-your-default-ios-browser-2012-06\n\nA: It’s possible to change the default mail app on iOS for mailto: links clicked in a web browser. Developers of Gmail app could develop a Safari extension that injects a JavaScript file in every webpage. Such file could modify the DOM, replacing all mailto: links into gmail: links.

My built-in SSD is relatively limited when it comes to storing all my media files, which is why most of my iTunes library lives in the cloud via iTunes Match, for streaming on demand.\nIn the near future I'm going to be disconnected from the internet for about a month, and I want to have a offline copy of all my music so I can continue to listen to it, but I don't want to download it all to my main iTunes library. \nHow can I create a separate, offline library containing every song I have in iTunes Match?\n\nA: The solution is relatively simple. Make sure you have enough space available on your external drive (I needed about 100GB). \nHold option (alt for Windows users) when opening iTunes and choose to create a new library. Save this library to a location on your external drive.\nTurn on iTunes Match, select every song (⌘+A), right click, and choose download.

The first time I ran Xcode, it opened fine, though I didn't try using it. The problem appeared when I first opened an existing project.\n\n*I created a new user on the machine. When that user is logged on Xcode loads successfully. Apparently it is a user settings issue.\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem where xcode was hanging on opening one particular project.  I wanted a very precise fix without having to remove all the settings. I deleted proj.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/<user>.userdatad/UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate from the .xcodeproj folder and that solved the problem.\nSo if you are having Xcode hang while attempting to open one particular project, this is the file that you need to delete.\n\nA: Removing the ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.dt.Xcode.savedState/directory might help as well.\n\nA: A slightly improved answer:\nI didn't need to reinstall Xcode at all, just remove the 'unsaved documents':\nSearch in ~/Library for Xcode (by name)\n(to search, you go to this folder, enter Xcode, with the drop down choose \"by name\", and then click the \"Library\ndelete anything matching in ~/Library/Caches or \"~/Library/Autosave Information\" or that looks like it might be an unsaved documents\n\nA: My problem was due to iCloud.\nAll my projects were inside documents folder which is iCloud folder.\nBecause iCloud settings in my MacBook was with the optimize option, the content of files weren’t allocated locally in the hard drive but remotely in iCloud. That was the cause for unresponsiveness of Xcode when loading the project or even starting new one.\nI moved all the projects to local folder in hard disk not included as a backup for iCloud and it solved the problem.\n\nA: No need to reinstall Xcode.\nBased on this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3830815\n\n*\n\n*I deleted all Xcode related \"Unsaved Docs\" docs found via the Finder search;\n\n*I removed the ~/Library/Developer folder;\n\n*Emptied the trash.\n\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: Deleting the latest file (GPUToolsAgent.sock ) in that Xcode directory solved it.\nEds-MBP-3:echo ed$ ls -artl ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 ed  staff   64 Apr  2  2018 DocumentationCache\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 ed  staff  160 Feb 28 13:49 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  17 ed  staff  544 Apr 19 20:39 iOS Device Logs\ndrwxr-xr-x   7 ed  staff  224 Apr 29 12:18 DerivedData\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 ed  staff  160 Apr 29 12:40 UserData\nsrwxr-xr-x   1 ed  staff    0 Apr 29 13:56 GPUToolsAgent.sock\ndrwxr-xr-x   7 ed  staff  224 Apr 29 13:56 .\nEds-MBP-3:echo ed$ rm -f ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/GPUToolsAgent.sock \n\n\nA: I tried all the solutions on here and none of them worked. However, I managed to fix this issue and here is what worked for me: If you're on an apple OS and have iCloud sync enabled on your desktop/documents/any folder where you're loading Xcode from, the iCloud sync could be causing this issue. \nI installed a fresh copy of my RN native on a folder not synced by iCloud and subsequently the issue was resolved! \n\nA: I couldn't figure out how to delete Unsaved Docs related to Xcode, so I resorted to wiping out the whole hard drive after backing up my projects to Bitbucket. It worked, but it obviously took a while. If you can figure out how to delete unsaved files related to Xcode, I'd recommend doing that first. If you can't figure out how to do that like me, or it doesn't work, wiping out your hard drive should work.\nThis problem was intolerable. It took away my ability to do my job so I needed to fix it and I knew this method would work.\n\nA: This just happened to me when I updated an XCode Source Editor Extension.\nDeleting that extension app from the Applications directory allowed XCode to start normally again.\n\nA: I tried to delete:\n~/Library/Developer/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode\n~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData\n~/Library/Developer/Saved Application State/com.apple.dt.Xcode.savedState\n~/workspace/MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata\n\nand once it helped. But another time it didn't help, so I also tried to reinstall Xcode, which also didn't help.\nIt turned out that the problem was that I was installing the app via WiFi or Bluetooth. When I connected my device via cable, the Xcode popped up to life and the \"loading forever\" stopped.\n\nA: You can try to open another project if you have, and then open your current project\n\nOr creating a new Swift file, then open it.\nThen go back to open your current project.\nThat may work as well.\n\nA: For me on Xcode 13.2.1 on macOS Monterey, Xcode had been hanging on startup, unrelated to any project, and none of the other answers helped.\nI ended up resolving the problem by removing all Xcode Source Editor extensions: Go to System Preferences > Extensions > Xcode Source Editor, then uncheck any extensions that you may have installed.\n\nA: In my case source control was enabled and that's causing this issue\npreferences > Source Control > uncheck Enable source control\n\n", "Q: My fiance's iPhone 4 is still running on iOS 5, now that 6.1.3 has been released can I upgrade her to 6.1.2 so she can use evasion?

I tried to enter iCloud with the same Apple ID and password that I use to (successfully) log into the App store.   Then I reset it.   Actually there's a bug on the site that asks for your birthdate, but leaves off the year, so no matter what you put in, it's always wrong.  I was finally able to reset the password.   I tried logging in with the new password, but it wouldn't let me.

I have a 2009 MBP with 8GB of RAM. I run Windows under Parallels pretty much all the time (I use Visual Studio for work). I recently installed an SSD to speed it up a bit and its running beautifully. However I could do with having a few extra gigs available to the Windows VM and was wondering if it would be worth buying 2 x 8GB SIMs to enable this. Apple states that the maxiumum for MBPs is 8GB, but I have seen figures online (possibly at OWC) which would suggest that Apple's specs are just guidelines which can be over-ruled.\nDoes anyone have any experience of 'overloading' their Macs with RAM?

I just didn't care when I did it.\n\nA: I want to affirm that you can run 16GB of RAM on a 2009 Macbook Pro 13 inch. I just installed 16GB of Ram, a new battery and a 1 TB SSD Hard Drive and the machine runs like a porche, even though the Genius at the Apple Store told me that my 2009, 2011, and now 2013 Macbook pros were a bunch of \"Mini-vans.\" \nHere is the caveat- sometimes machines do not \"want\" to recognize the cards and either gave the 3 ALARM sound on start up, refused to boot, or the 1 Alarm sound at start up. 3 Alarm sounds indicate that the machine cannot recognize the slot and 1 Alarm indicates that the machine cannot recognize the RAM. But, if you put in an 8G RAM stick in the bottom slot and a 4G stick in the upper slot and then boot, it will recognize the two slots. Then, if you add the other 8, it will recognize both, or some combo of this kind of trickery. I have had to play around with the process of swapping out ram sticks until you \"trick the machine\"to boot.\nAt any rate, once the Macbook is past warranty and starts collecting dust, why not see what it can do! I am running three MBP's that run like race horses as \"frankenmacs\"\n\nA: For anyone wondering about this in 2019 (this old discussion is the first thing that comes up on a Google search when looking for \"mid-2009 Macbook memory upgrade, maximum, 8gb, 16gb\" or some combo thereof), no, you can't get your 2009 Macbook Pro to recognize more than 8gb of memory -- and no, there's not a magic act of \"tricking\" your Macbook into booting with one 8gb stick and one 4gb stick -- either way you'll get three beeps and a non-booting Macbook Pro. This is for the mid-2009 Macbook Pro 17\" 5,2.\n\nA: I have a MBP you describe myself and there is no point in updating your older Macbook Pro to 16GB. I've tried this myself - but it does not work as the processor cannot handle the speed you want to achieve. \n\nA: Thanks to everyone for your responses. I'm going to answer this one myself as I've just found an article at OWC which seems definitive. For anyone wanting to do this, it seems the conditions your machine needs to meet are pretty specific. Looks like Tim Cook might well be getting more of my hard-earned ca$h yet ...\n\nA: You can with out a doubt run 16gb of ram. A classmate and I were discussing this and he made the upgrade and showed me that the laptop recognized everything. I asked him about a year later if it was still running ok and he said he is still using it and has had no issues. I will be making the upgrade myself as one of my 4gb chips died.\n", "Q: iTunes uses over 1.5GB of memory I use an old (2007) Mac Mini (10.7.5) to serve iTunes (11.0.2) and recently it has started using a lot of memory. It has never been what you would call efficient in terms of memory allocation, but 1.5+GB seems high even for iTunes. It starts out around 115MB and every so slowly climbs even with nothing using or accessing it.\nAnybody else seen this?\nAnd no, purge does not help. :)\n\nThe machine has 4GB installed but of course OSX sees 3GB.\nThe iTunes library is about 300GB.\nThere are no other active processing going on and the machine is not used as a desktop. \nIt is not actively importing new content or even playing content at all. Mostly it just sleeps.\nWhen launched, iTunes uses a bit over 100MB according to Activity Monitor.\nAll it does is run iTunes so various iOS devices can wirelessly sync when they want to. I restarted iTunes yesterday and it used 113MB. This evening I came back and it is using a little over 1,000MB and growing ever so slightly. \n\nA: I believe I have figured it out. I relocated my iPhoto library but had never opened it afterwards in iPhoto. I believe that iTunes has a memory leak in handling when it tries to access the library that no longer exists. Once I opened iPhoto and selected the new library location the memory leak in iTunes stopped.\n", "Q: Tmux with iterm2 integration won't start when invoked with tmux -CC I'm using iterm2 Build 1.0.0.20130302 and would like to get tmux working.

In the App Store it shows an update for OS X 10.8.3. I tried to update, but it’s showing the following error: An error occurred while downloading the updates. (102).\nAny help regarding this issue will be appreciated...\n\nA: This happened to me last night. Close the App Store and Re-Open. Hit Update again next to the 10.8.3 description and it should start up again. This happens when your download connection drops out. The App Store application is actually just a web browsing frame which caches cookies with a delay for queries so it sometimes takes a minute to \"refresh\" itself to try again.\n\nA: You can update manually using the 10.8.3 delta update from Apple.\n", "Q: Photos are being swapped between both iphones I had iphone4 which I sent overseas to a friend. And I purchased iphone5 which I am using. Just lately I've been getting his photos that he takes and photos which I take of my family are going to his \"gallery\". I am not sure why but pls help. I need to know why this is happening and what I can do to stop this.\n\nA: When you sent your iPhone 4 to your friend, the device was not properly wiped first. As a result, all of your accounts are most likely still signed in on his device.\nThe best recommendation is to completely erase the device. To do this instruct your friend to go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. This will wipe the phone and restore it to factory settings. Your friend can then proceed through setup and plug in his own accounts.\nIf your friend is not willing to wipe the entire device, I recommend he signs out of all of your accounts. He will want to go to all of the following places to do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > iCloud\n\n*Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Settings > Messages\n\n*Settings > FaceTime\n\n*Settings > iTunes & App Stores\n\n*Settings > Music\n\n\nYou may also have apps that were left installed on your iPhone with your account signed in as well (Facebook and Twitter, for example), that you may want to also check.\n", "Q: Can i use iPhoto to trim my photos? I scaned many photos to one image file. How can i cut it down to many pieces? Can iPhoto do that or is there any other free software suggestion?\n\nA: In contrast to Lizzan, I suggest you do it with iPhoto. So the answer is yes, you can do it with iPhoto. The reason why I suggest it is because iPhoto never destroys your image! It keeps the original image as it is and saves your changes to a separate file. You can always restore your original image. I don't know the OS you're using but prior to (I think) Lion there is no Version feature so returning to your original image is impossible.  \nSo here's how you do it: http://support.apple.com/kb/VI191 \nYou could crop the region you like and then save it as a new image. Then go back to your original and take the next region...\n\nA: I'd suggest Preview - just open the image file, drag a selection around the images, one by one, copy it and go to File -> New from Clipboard to get a new file. Save it in your preferred format and you're done!\n", "Q: What's the right way to backups photos when using iPhoto? I have a folder called My-Photos where I have all my family photos.\nNow I opened iPhoto app and import all those photos. Then I have the photo file in 2 places: My-Photos folder which I have created and in user/images/iPhoto Library which is the location where iPhoto storage all the information.\nMy question is. which folder should I backup to be sure that the originas photos are backup? \nIf the answer is that I have to backup user/images/iPhoto Library then my question is which folder, because there are many folders in it... and some of them have a huge size.\n\nA: Your iPhoto Library is contained within a database file on your computer. This file is located here:\n/Users/(yourusername)/Pictures/iPhoto Library.photolibrary\nThat is the file (or technically, package file) that you will want to ensure is backed up to backup your iPhoto pictures.\nAs mentioned previously in comments, I recommend that you backup your entire hard drive instead of just your pictures. You can use a tool like Time Machine to backup to an external hard drive, or a service like CrashPlan to backup to the cloud.\n\nA: source: http://support.apple.com/kb/ph2438\nTo export photos:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the photo or photos you want to export.\n\n*Choose File > Export.\n\n*Specify your other options.\n\n*Click Export.\n\n", "Q: Web Site Hi Jacked Parallels has taken over a web site on Safari on my Ipad so that whenever I type in the address Parallels opens. How can I fix this?\n\nA: I am guessing here due to incomplete information. \nCheck your Safari Preference settings. Make sure it is what you want.\nCheck the Search Engine, Home page, new widow settings. \nFind the website in question in your history and delete it than type it new in the Safari browser window. I assume you have no odd Safari plug ins installed? \n", "Q: Screen mirroring and image resize I have two questions about this topic.\n1) Suppose my MBP is connected to the TV via HDMI (TV is 55 inch). Can I resize to, say 27 inch or anything less than the actual size of the TV?\n2) I have two MBP (2012 and 2009). If MBP_1 is connected to the TV via HDMI, can I project the desktop of MBP_2 to the TV via MBP_1?  \n\nA: Q1: The screen resolution of an external monitor is independent from the internal monitor, when you open display preferences the display preference pane is shown on every monitor. If you set up screen mirroring the resolution is set to that of the smallest screen unless you make it smaller. Note: the size of the tv is relatively irrelevant, it's the resolution that matters (probably it's full hd 1920x1080). If you plan to view it via RDP you probably won't have any issues using a computer with an HD monitor.\nQ2: To project the screen of MBP2 on TV through MBP1 all you have to do is set up screen sharing (on MPB2) from the sharing preference pane, connect through Finder and drag and drop the window displaying MBP2's screen to the TV.\n\nA: If you RDP to your Macbook Pro 2 from your Macbook Pro 1, you can display that screen on the television - as it displays the screens visible on your screen.\nQuestion one is pretty vague to me, do you want to display black borders on your tv and not have it full screen? Or how do you mean this? I'll update the answer once this is clear.\n", "Q: quicktime play/pause keyboard shortcut Is there any ability to start playing and set pause for video in quicktime by keyboard hotkey.\nNow i'm doing window switch and then clicking on space key to achieve it.

Gaming has taken on a whole new dimension since the introduction of the iPhone & definitely the iPad. Whilst these two Apple devices are great gaming devices, alot of games still try to emulate gamepads with onscreen buttons that are not so great.\nIs there an App that will turn a gamepad eg an XBox 360 or Playstation gamepad into a controller for any game with touchscreen buttons & How to configure it ?\n\nA: It's definitely possible to use a PS3 controller on a jailbroken iPhone. You need the $7 app Blutrol and the SixpairTool for MacOS X. Before I rewrite the instructions, please simply refer to http://lifehacker.com/5991266/how-to-use-a-gamepad-for-any-ios-game-not-just-emulators.\nEDIT: In a nutshell\nGETTING READY:\nFirst, you need an jailbreak your iOS device. Then, download the App Blutrol (http://apt.thebigboss.org/mobileweb/onepackage.php?bundleid=ch.ringwald.blutrol&db=), which currently costs $6.99. In order to use the PS3 controller, you will need an additional app for MacOS: SixPairMac (ringwald.ch/cydia/blutrol/SixPairMac-v1.0.zip)\nSETUP for PS3 controllers:\nConnect the PS3 controller via USB Cable, and the iOS device (via lightning cable or 30-pin cable) to your Mac. Click the button \"Pair Controller to iPad\" in SixPairMac. Now, open Blutrol on your iOS device and select the PS3 controller.\n\nA: Sadly this is not possible without a jailbreak.\nHowever, projects like this one and this one deliver physical gaming buttons to your iPhone. They are still in development however.\n\nA: This is not going to be possible. Every individual game developer is responsible for developing their own unique code for how they interact (or don't interact) with external accessories. Beyond that any third-party controller would need to connect via a specific Bluetooth stack to make them compatible with iOS devices (something that Microsoft and Sony most certainly have not done).\nWhile I understand your desire and sentiment, this is not going to work. There are a few device makers that have made physical buttons to overlay on the screen and Bluetooth gaming controllers. However, even these devices have spotty support in games.\n\nA: Jailbreak your device and get blutrol on cydia with you Xbox controller:)\nIf on IPad mini put you controller on screen go to lock screen and click the game you want to play the controller on:)\n", "Q: Apple care - product registration I brought a macbook pro last year (on the 24th of March 2012). and today i tried to buy a apple care protection plan. When i tried to register the apple care protection plan i got an message which states;\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience, but registration for this product requires additional documentation. Please submit your proof of purchase for review by Apple. If your registration is accepted, your product will be covered.\n\n\nTherefore, i uploaded the receipt that i got from a local store. Is it the receipt that they are expecting ?\nAnd, they have told me that they will get back to me within 24-48 hours. If they get late i will not be able to register the apple care protection plan before the deadline.\nWhat will hapen if apple gets delayed to reply to me and as a result i fail to register the apple care protection plan before the deadline (24th March 2013). Will the apple care protection plan get cancelled and i will not be able to get apple's support for 2 years from now ?\n\nA: When a reseller sells Macs, they are supposed to report the sales data properly back to Apple. If this data is not reported, the \"sales date\" in Apple's system is the date the reseller bought it, not the date you bought it from them. Apple is requesting your original proof of purchase, which you've provided.\nIn general, if it is clearly shown that you have attempted to purchase AppleCare within your one-year period you should have no issues getting this registered, even if the date creeps slighly past the one-year mark. A good option as well is to visit a local Apple Store if you have any issues, with any documentation. I have seen store Geniuses and Managers go out of their way to ensure issues like this are resolved appropriately.\n", "Q: Create backup iPhone with forgotten encryption password I'm trying to make a backup from my iPhone, however it's set to be password protected.\nI do not know the password, as I've never set one. I've tried all the passwords I know, which I've ever used to make sure I didn't set it.\nI've also tried the default 0000 and 1234 codes. \nI want to uncheck the encryption checkbox in iTunes, but it requires me to type a password.\nWhat else can I try?\nI have no problems in removing all backups and start from the scratch somehow, however - I do not want to restore my phone as new and remove all those settings.     \n\nA: The short answer is no. The phone thinks you are a thief trying to steal the data and won't cooperate with attempts to initiate a second backup. Your best bet is if you have a computer that was syncing / backing up the device and follow the steps listed for a disabled device with a passcode:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: Device disabled after entering wrong passcode\nOnce your iOS device is locked with a passcode, the data at rest is scrambled and the decryption key is only stored inside the iOS keychain or inside a backup of the device in iCloud or on a computer.\nEven if you connected the device to a computer and got past the hardware telling the USB storage to not present itself - you would need to perform a decryption of whatever forensic image you retrieved.\nWithout knowing your situation (exact device, iOS version, whether it's an older device that doesn't have Data Protection, where else you may have backed up the device so that you could try restoring a backup onto an unlocked device (where you could then choose a different passcode) it's hard to guess what your best move is next.\nYou could:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit more details into the question\n\n*ask a follow on question once you've explored your options\n\n*Contact Apple to do some troubleshooting / learn more options\n\n\nA: If you have no problem deleting your backup, this problem is a breeze:\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes → Preferences → Devices\n\n\n*Select your phone → Delete the backup\n\n*\n\n*If you want an additional safety net, copy your backup directory:\n# MacOS\n  ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\n# Windows:\n  %AppData%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\n\n\n\n\n\n*Once backup is deleted, simply create a new backup from scratch\n", "Q: Why do certain packages fail in NetInstall? We are using NetInstall to image Macs at work. I build the NetInstall images with System Image Utility, and customize them with the \"Add Packages and Post-Install Scripts\" workflow item. NetInstall itself works great but I've noticed that several third-party install packages cause the imaging process to fail. A good example is Symantec Endpoint Protection.\nMy workaround has been to use JAMF Composer to snapshot an installation on a test machine to use that to create a new installer package. This works 99% of the time. However, I was wondering... What is it specifically about certain installation packages (.pkg files) that causes them to fail during the NetInstall process?\n\nA: There can be several reasons for this. Probably the most common is that installer writers may not consider the possibility that their package might be installed on something other than the startup volume (i.e. with NetInstall, you're booted from a network volume but installing onto the local HD). The Installer application knows how to put the package's install files where they need to go, but if there are any associated scripts and such in the package, they may not cope with running from one volume and installing onto another.\nAnother (closely related) problem is that the package may have scripts that depend on resources that don't exist in a NetInstall environment. NetInstall runs in a pretty stripped-down version of OS X -- it includes everything most package scripts would need, but if they need something unexpected (like Finder, for example), they will fail and possibly cause the install to fail.\n", "Q: ImageMagick - Convert multipage pdf to animated gif I have a two-page PDF file that I would like to convert to an animated GIF file.

If you are working at an iMac and there is also a mains socket close at hand, is there any difference (in any respect) to charging an iPhone via USB cable linked to the Mac or is it more advisable to charge via a charger to the mains socket.\neg\nIs there a difference in the time taken to charge using one method than the other. ?\nIf using the Mac to charge, does it cause the Mac to use more RAM in the process (and could this prove to be detrimental on Mac performance if using resource hungry software). ?\n\nA: According to Apple's support document on the subject:\n\nFor the quickest charge, connect the device to a power outlet using the USB cable that came with the device and an Apple USB power adapter.\n\nThe USB spec limits the amount of current that a device may draw from a USB port (500 mA); the included Apple standalone power adapter can supply double that (1 A). The difference is even more dramatic for devices that have higher current draw to recharge (newer model iPads, for example).\nGenerally speaking, charging from your computer won't affect the performance of your computer at all as long as you aren't syncing or otherwise interacting with the device. USB can supply power without requiring data transmission (such is the case for wall adapters).\n\nA: It is a known fact that mobile devices charge faster when connected to a power outlet. Connecting an iPhone to a Mac isn't a resource hungry operation, RAM consumption is negligible even while syncing.\n\nA: It seems to me that my iPhone actually charges faster when connected to my car battery via the cigarette lighter outlet. :-)\n\\\n", "Q: how to reset iTunes incorrect unplayed Podcast count I have an odd question, but at some point after updating to iTunes 11 my unplayed podcast count suddenly went up to well over 1,000 despite only having a few unplayed episodes at any given time. The number was at like 1,200, but today still shows the number being at over 1,000. At the time the screenshot below was taking the actual unplayed Podcast episode count was 4.\n\nMy problem is i've never seen or encountered anything like this in iTunes before so I am not even sure what I should start searching for as a means to fix this. Anybody have any suggestions?\nPer request here is my unplayed podcasts list it shows when I click on the podcasts section\n\n\nA: Well I guess after accidentally stumbling onto the fix I'll explain what I found.\niTunes is sometimes bad at managing feeds. One podcast for some reason it split up into 2 feeds even though they were really one, I deleted one and it got rid of both. My unplayed count went down, but there was still like 900+ unplayed count. Then I stumbled upon it. If you go to the \"List\" section in Podcasts (which I've never spent any time in because I assumed it was just the podcast list in different form) I found the reason.\nWhen I subscribe to a podcast I typically tend to change the rules for a podcast so it only keeps the most recent or only unplayed episodes. If you ever want to go back to an old episode you can right click on a Podcast feed and tell iTunes to list all episodes. From there then you can select individual old episodes to download.\nFor some reason iTunes can treat this episode listing as suddenly having a whole bunch of new episodes. Even though you never downloaded any of them or had long since deleted them through iTunes rules, it treats them as unplayed episodes in the listing, though if you go back to the \"Unplayed\" section they never show up there. Though this also happened to be the case for at least 1 podcast I am certain I never asked it to retrieve old episodes for. \nSo if you ever get something like this check the listing, even though you really don't have \"unplayed\" episodes iTunes may show a lot of episodes of your podcasts there as being \"unplayed\" because they are in the feed. Select all and right-click and select \"mark as played.\" Manually mark as unplayed any episodes you forgot to de-select and suddenly your iTunes unplayed podcast count is correct.\nI've attached a screenshot showing iTunes considering a whole big listing of Hypercritical episodes as \"unplayed\" even though you can see they aren't downloaded to my Mac.\n\n", "Q: Can an alias be added to the dock via the command line?

The latter, however, along with the new format for the Dock plist, and some dict manipulation tips, gives more clues to creating a modern script.\n\nA: Definitely scriptable with terminal commands.\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\n\nShows you the actual configuration for the dock.\nWithin the above file you need to modify the \"persistent-others\" array if you want to create a \"file\" alias.\nThis is done the following way:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"add:persistent-others:0 dict\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\n\nIf you want an application alias you will need to modify the \"persistent-apps\" array.\nOnce you make the changes and you are testing you need to do:\nkillall dock\n\nto refresh the dock.\n", "Q: Add admin username & password to the keychain How can the admin's username password, be remembered or added it to the keychain so these annoying prompts would be less frequent?\n\nThe app referenced here (Anvil) is not relevant.\nI'm looking for a way to loosen up the the prompts for credentials.\n\nA: You can go about this the other way around.\nOpen Keychain Access and find the items you need and modify that item so that the app in question is white listed for the password or credential being used.\n\nOnce you are in Access Control - you can white list certain apps or all apps.

Is this possible?\nIn normal MS Outlook you can send as someone else (if you are on the distribution group I think). It's an option when you reply to an email.\nCan you do the same using Mail.app on iPad?\n\nA: Mail.app on iPad does not support sending as or send on behalf of.

Finding these hidden Login Items now has become a PITA (pain in the app) with either grep'ing your way through the Applications folder or manually open app bundles looking in /Contents/Library/ for a \"LoginItems\" folder and it's contents.

For a login item in an app's internal Contents/Library/LoginItems directory, the service identifier should be the login item's bundle identifier (CFBundleIdentifier), which you can get from the item's Contents/Info.plist. You can confirm that this identifier shows up in launchctl list.\nTo disable, run launchctl disable gui/$UID/<bundle id>. For example, to disable the WireGuard run-at-startup (located at /Applications/WireGuard.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/WireGuardLoginItemHelper.app), which as of version 1.0.15 did not have a preference to disable autostart, you would run\nlaunchctl disable gui/$UID/com.wireguard.macos.login-item-helper\n(In a terminal, you can type echo $UID to obtain your current user ID).\n", "Q: What devices is the iPod to Firewire 400 adapter meant for, and for what purpose?

You could try updating to 6.1.3, then using redsn0w to make a tethered jailbreak with 6.0.0, but that might cause issues. I would watch a tutorial on that though. My iPhone has also bricked.

I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't at least attempt a reconnect on its own, is there a way to tell it to auto retry connections that drop?\n\nA: I had the same problems with airplay dropping out randomnly.\nI changed the resolution to 720p instead of 1080p and now it plays flawlessly without disconnecting once.\n\nA: We found (through trial and error) that disconnecting the AP in one area solved all our disconnect issues.  Despite having full signal strength and quality to it, there were a lot of lost packets when on that one.  Same AP works fine elsewhere, best guess is something odd about the location interfering with wifi signals.\n\nA: One thing to consider in your WiFi environment is excluding 5GHz channels 149 and 153 from your APs. Airplay uses these channels and you may see reduced wireless performance or Airplay dropping a connection if these channels are in use.\n", "Q: Why is it that I can no longer access some folders in my old time machine backups and how can I get access?

They have dyslexia and would like to use voiceover to read certain paragraphs or sentences that they are finding tricky. \nI'd a like a global method whereby just the paragraph or sentence under the cursor can be readout. Enabling voiceover for everything is too verbose and unnecessary.\n\nA: While there is a contextual menu for Speech » Start speaking that will speak the selected text, it requires navigating several menus. If you want to be able to speak the selection without navigating menus, create an automator service that receives text in any application. Give it a single action: Run shell script. The shell script is utterly simple: /usr/bin/say (it will take the argument of what to say from stdin, which in this case will be the selected text). Save the service (I called it \"Say paragraph\").\nThen, in System Preferences, you can assign this action a keyboard shortcut (I gave it  the keystroke ControlShift1). So triple click, then ControlShift1 and it speaks what's under the mouse pointer.\n\n\nA: OS X has a contextual control to speak only the selected text so your user could select the text to be spoken and right click to bring up the contextual menu and speak only whatever text is selected.\nThere are alternate controls if right click is difficult, but hopefully this helps to reduce the wait time when you don't want to start speaking from the beginning of the document.\n", "Q: How do I update my 4.3.3 iPod?

The text message itself will be prefaced by the phone number the text is coming from, but even though that number is in my contact list, the message does not offer me the name of the person.  I have an iPhone 4 and I'm running iOS 6.1.  Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: This is, unfortunately, a limitation of Google Voice. Google Voice cannot spoof your friends' numbers, so it has to send texts from its own numbers. However, each of your contacts will have a unique number from which Voice will send you texts, so you can send messages to those numbers and reply to them and it will reach your friends.\nThere are two ways around this. You can use the Google Voice app. Messages will come through your data plan and not your SMS plan, and they'll show up with the right names and everything. Alternatively, you can add the numbers Google uses as the \"from\" address as another number in your iPhone contacts. The number will still work to reach them, and the messages will appear to come from your Google Voice number.\n\nA: As google has shown in this link, this is a normal feature of Voice.\nYou have your Voice account set up to forward messages to your phone (from google). Unless you have a phone number at Google Voice, you will receive the messages from one of the random phone numbers that Google owns.\nIt is stated many times on the net that if you get the Google Voice app, it will show you the actual number of the sender; rather than the number assigned to forward the messages to your phone. This should eliminate the issue.\n\nA: The problem is not a normal feature of Google Voice (nobody else has ever experienced it, to my knowledge, except the original poster of this question). It was not caused by Google Voice settings. It was not caused by Google Voice iOS app. It was not caused by Messages app. It was not caused by SMS GV Extension. It WAS caused by Google Contacts sync. I fixed the problem simply by deactivating Google Contacts sync on my iPhone and then reactivating it a minute later. \nPlease stop editing this answer to remove the important explanatory material in the blog post I wrote about the issue. You are not helping anyone by hiding this information.\n\nA: The reason the texts come from a strange number is so that replies will go back through google and appear to come from your google voice number.  If the texts came from the real users phone number, when you sms'ed back, it would be from your iPhone's phone number, and not from your GV number on their side.\n", "Q: How can I tell OSX NOT to mount some of the drives in my computer?

I am wondering why in Ubuntu linux, it's also openSSH package, but do have \"-Z\" option, but for the same package in MacOS, there is no \"-Z\" option at all?\nBy the way, \"-Z\" option will enable \"ssh\" to use obfuscated data (TCP header) communication.

I write mails into the archive once a month (as I reach my quota), but I read from it frequently. The archive mailbox has grown to a couple of gig in size. Having just bought a second Mac, I'd like to share this mailbox across Mail.app on both Macs. Please can some suggest a good solution for doing this? I am reasonably happy to ignore concurrent access problems as a) I will almost certainly never make concurrent writes to to the archive, and b) concurrent reads should be ok for most systems that I can imagine.\nMy first attempted solution was to move the .mbox file to Dropbox and soft link (ln -s) that file (actually a directory) back to its original location. However when I opened Mail.app the mailbox disappeared. Any suggestion on how to get this to work would also be appreciated.\n\nA: I had a similar problem a few years ago and decided to move to a better email service. I chose Gmail, mainly because of the >10GB storage. \nYou can migrate your locally stored messages via IMAP. Once you set up your Gmail account, add the IMAP server to Mail. Then drag and drop all the messages you want to migrate on the Gmail inbox. IMAP will do the rest. \nAdding the IMAP server to multiple devices will obviously keep them all in sync. \nIn general, I would recommend this over using a local option. IMAP is a superb protocol and I don't see the advantage of trying to sync the local archive in any other way.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on Mountain Lion I'm working on a MacBook late 2008 Unibody Aluminium with Mountain Lion on. \nI'm trying to mount Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit on a USB stick in Mountain Lion but it seems impossible. \nI've read all the documentation on how to install it on the Ubuntu\nsite with all the command lines etc., but it's not working. I get errors like \"No mountable file detected\" when trying to open the .iso file. \nI'm specifically looking to have an OS that doesn't make high frequency noises. Has anyone been able to install 12.04 LTS Ubuntu on their Mac (with Mountain Lion)?\n\nA: This can be achieved using Linux USB Creator For Mac.\nInstructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*First just select the linux distribution you want to use. You can either select from the list or browse for a Local ISO file to use.\n\n*After choosing Ubuntu you can browse for your USB device.\n\n*The program will then download the ISO, Format the disk, Copy the ISO and Install the Bootloader.\n\n*Your USB Drive is now ready to use. Simply boot up your mac while holding the “alt” key and select the drive.\n\n\nA YouTube video is also included & can be viewed from the above link to complement.\nPlease note: This program hasn't been updated since the introduction of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.\n\nA: You shouldn't directly open the ISO file in OS X: it's not needed. You should simply convert the .img file to an .iso file and copy it to the USB stick using dd, following these instructions.\nThen restart your Mac pressing the Option key, and choose the live USB option.\n\nA: Many models of Mac firmware are incapable of booting Linux from a USB stick. I recommend you burn Ubuntu to a CD or DVD via the .ISO download, which will work without a hitch.\nWhile you can run Ubuntu natively, this has no guarantee of fixing your high-pitched noise, which sounds like a hardware issue to me. You will also have noticeably-reduced battery performance and, if your model has dual graphics cards, Ubuntu will only recognize one of them almost certainly.\n", "Q: Apple ID Password email address is inccorrect but store email address IS correct after restoring iPhone 4S So weird thing happened last night.  I was updating the iOS to my iPhone 4S when the cord accidentally got jerked out of the phone.  I had to reset the phone and restore from back-up.  Now when I try to update the apps the window pops up asking for my password but weird thing.....the email address that it show is NOT my email address.  When I go into my phone setting AND the Apple Store it shows my Apple ID email correct.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: If an app was installed by someone else (say, a friend or family member) using their Apple ID, you will be required to type in that Apple ID's password to reauthorize the app to your device now that it has been wiped & restored.\nIf it is a free app it is asking you to authorize, you can also remove the app and re-download through the App Store using your own Apple ID account.\n", "Q: 16GB of RAM makes MacBook Pro's fans go wild before sleep? I recently: \n\n\n*\n\n*installed 16 GB of RAM (1600 MHz);\n\n*on my late-2011 15-inch MacBook Pro; \n\n*running OS X 10.7, aka Lion;\n\n*with an Apple SSD drive.\n\n\nAccording to Apple my MacBook Pro only supports a maximum of 8 GB at 1333 MHz, but the chipset supports more (both GB and MHz) — but I'm aware that it does not mean it'll actually be compatible with my machine.\n\nThe problem:\nWhenever I put the laptop to sleep (by closing it), it takes a while, and the fans start spinning very loudly before the computer finally reaches sleep mode.\nThe reason is likely to be Safe Sleep — but why are the fans going crazy?\nIs there something wrong with my Mac? \nHow do I prevent this without disabling Safe Sleep?\nWould updating to OS X 10.8, Mountain Lion, help?\n\nA: That is normal function. \nIt is called air vent (power air purge), to remove the residual heat before shutting down (or sleep mode).\nIt is meant to prolong the life of your devices.\nThe designers have figured out that by shutting a hot computer down, since there is no ventilation the heat actually rises inside. \nThat is not so good for the computer so someone had the bright idea to do the air purge before shutting down. :)\nHowever! one should say that you are running your computer at the \"Borderline\" (hehe) of capacity for cooling since you stuffed it up with more heating sources.\n", "Q: Mail.app button to explicitly move to Junk without built-in filtering I'd like to create a button in Mountain Lion's Mail.app to move mail to an IMAP folder called Junk, much like the Archive button moves mail to my IMAP Archive folder.  (This folder is automatically emptied on my server periodically and used to train spam filters.)\nI thought perhaps I could leverage the Junk button, but that seems to require turning on the built-in filtering engine, which I do not believe I want to do.  I specifically want to just move the message myself explicitly.\nI'm currently using the Favorites bar, to which I've added the requisite folder, and I can either drag messages there or use the keyboard shortcut (e.g. command-control-4, since it's the fourth folder on my bar—unfortunately, I find such a combo awkward to press), but I'd really prefer a button I could stick on the toolbar.\n\nA: You can do this exactly by \"customizing\" the action that the \"Junk\" button performs:\nMail Menu> Preferences> Junk Mail tab>\nWhen Junk Mail Arrives:\nselect Perform Custom actions (Click Advanced to configure)\nThen, click Advanced button in lower center of Pref Pane, next to Reset\nThis allows you to create a custom Rule, essentialy, just like other Rules, in the \"Rules\" Preference Pane, but it activates when you click the \"Junk\" button or when Mail thinks it found something that is Junk (keep reading to limit automatic Junk Mail filtering).\n\n\n*\n\n**Notice how the default rule has the condition that \"Message is Junk\"? Possibly just removing this will avoid Mail from auto-triggering the filter, maybe, however, there is another step we can take (keep reading).\n\n**I would probably delete all the conditions here by default (which are just the same as the default actions)\n\n\nThe rule I would suggest is:\n\n\n*\n\n*If \"any\" of the following conditions are met\n\n*\"account\" is \"name of your account in question\"\n\n*Perform the following actions \"Move Message\" to mailbox \"name of the mailbox that you have set-up on your server as 'Junk' or similar\" (as oppose to the \"Junk\" folder built-in to Mail.app)\n\n\nThat's most of it.\nAdditional tips/possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could Reset the filter. However, to really take control, see the numbered list below.\n\n*Uncheck Trust junk mail headers in messages (if you want more control over your Junk Mail filter)\n\n*I would leave the other options about exemption checked, as they stop the filter from auto-triggering.\n\n\nTo become master of your Junk Mail 'Smart Filter':\n\n\n*\n\n*QUIT Mail.app\n\n*In Finder, hit 'command-shift-g' and paste or type without the single-quotes/apostrophes '~/Library/Mail/' \n\n*look for the file \"LSMMap2\". On my Mountain Lion Install it is located in: ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData\nand does not appear to be hidden\n\n*Once located, delete the file.\n\n*Create an empty text file (remember not to hide its extension, you do not want any extension, and save it/move it to the same folder LSMMAP2 was in.\n\n*Get info on the new *empty* LSMMAP2 file (command-i once you have the file selected in Finder)\n\n*Click the \"Locked\" check box under the \"General\" disclosure triangle (the are wherein is stated file size, type, dates, location, etc. (Also, double check that there is no '.txt' or '.rtf' file extension under the \"Name & Extension area\")\n\n*You're done, now Mail can't 'learn' about spam anymore since you just 'locked' it's 'notebook'.\n\n*You could always click the 'Reset' button if you like, just to make sure there are no temporary/cached files around since Mountain Lion loves to create these (invisibly).\n\n*Cleaning out temporary files is a secondary fallback, like running the Unix 'cron' Daily/Monthly/Weekly scripts, etc. There are many programs out there that can do this from the normal interface without command line etc, and there are many more cache files out there too. My favorite is Cocktail.\nIf you can't find the LSMMAP2 file, just use the Junk Mail button for a little while, then come back and look for it again. Since, if you reset it, it may have been deleted.\n", "Q: Can Mountain Lion OS X run on HP G62 series using VMWare virtualization?

I need to build a script that shows files in the same order as the default Downloads folder in the dock, ordered by Date Added, newest first. I can't seem to find the option in ls. \nAny other way to do it?\n\nA: Simpler (Faster) solution:\nmdls -name kMDItemFSName -name kMDItemDateAdded -raw * | \\\nxargs -0 -I {} echo {} | \\\nsed 'N;s/\\n/ /' | \\\nsort\n\n\nA: The date added is stored as metadata item kMDItemDateAdded and the mdls command will expose the data for each file passed as an argument to it.\nSo, to dump the date added for all files in Downloads in whatever arbitrary order * gets expanded by your shell, you can:\n\nmdls -name kMDItemDateAdded ~/Downloads/*\n\nYou'll need to hack together some combination of find and sed/awk/perl/whatever to assemble a replacement for ls but perhaps mdfind can be called by your script rather than needing to reinvent ls and parsing that output.\n\nA: Well, as usual, after writing the question I start digging for metadata content in files, and ended up writing this:\nls -a | \\\ngrep -v '^\\.$\\|^\\.\\.$' | \\\nxargs -I {} mdls -name kMDItemFSName -name kMDItemDateAdded {} | \\\nsed 'N;s/\\n//' | grep -v '(null)' | \\\nawk '{print $3 \" \" $4 \" \" substr($0,index($0,$7))}' | \\\nsort -r\n\nBasically it:\n1. list all files\n2. filters out . and ..\n3. gets the name and date added, one line after the other\n4. merges every two lines into 1 line\n5. extracts the date, time and name\n6. sorts it in reverse (since datetime is upfront, it sorts by datetime)\nHope it helps someone else! :)\n@bmike actually, the site imposed me a restriction to answer my own question only after 8 hours of posting my question, due to my lack of reputation :D\n", "Q: Stop text input from changing tm to ™ Every time I type \"tm\" in Safari, or an app that uses a Webkit control, it changes it to ™.

Is there any benefit in disabling wifi on my Mac Pro (connected to a time capsule via ethernet)?\nI notice that with it disabled airdrop doesn't work and iTunes wireless sync misbehaves.\n\nA: but will it affect speed of LAN transfers? \nWell, you can choose which one would be preferred (by dragging it to the top in the Network preference panel): \n\nAs far as I know you cannot get a FASTER transfer by using both at once...\n\nA: The benefit is, well, these other services will work.  The drawback is another active network interface, increased chatter on your local network, and a few extra watts blasting at you.\nThat said, there are a few things that can be done to minimize the disruption.\nPersonally I find AirDrop to be totally useless when Messages can do everything better: it can easily transfer files over Bonjour with another Mac running not just ML's Messages but also iChat.  My office of 60ish users rely on iChat (and now Messages) enough to where \"to iChat\" has become verbified around here.  AirDrop is 10.8 only.  \nAlso, Messages can be set to auto-accept incoming file transfers, look in Preferences > Alerts, change the Event to Incoming file transfer, check the Run AppleScript box and choose the Auto Accept default.  AirDrop has no such options.\niTunes wifi synch definitely works best if the Mac's wifi is on, but I don't think wi-fi synch is particularly useful; I'd rather have a faster synch that uses less battery life.\nFinally, AirPlay quality depends on many factors, such as your network hardware, signal strength, interference, and the remote devices.  Both my 2nd-gen AirPort Express and then my Philips Fidelio AD7000 would stutter and drop off my mixed b/g network from my Linksys WRT350N - until I replaced its firmware with DD-WRT.  Since then both have worked flawlessly.

It's a harmless bug where usually-hidden system apps suddenly show up, usually after installing a new app. I've seen reports of it happening on devices on iOS 6 with various combinations of tweaks installed, so I'm not sure whether any specific tweak is causing it, or whether it's related to the jailbreak itself. If you use Springtomize to hide Apple apps, you could try un-hiding those apps and seeing if the white icons come back (the hypothesis here is that maybe Springtomize's hidden apps feature is causing the problem for you).\n", "Q: Apple Discussions website not responding to clicks?

I lived in Canada for several years, but now I live in Norway (again).\nIn Canada, I have purchased many apps on both the iOS and Mac OS X app stores. Some of these apps I have uninstalled over the years for different reasons.\nI have now switched my Apple ID account country setting back to Norway, in order to get better app suggestions, etc. I have also changed my address and credit card.\nThe problem is that, now I can no longer see the apps that I purchased in Canada in my \"Purchases\" tab in the App Store, so I cannot re-download/reinstall any of them. When I go to one of these apps in the Norwegian App Store, it's as if I never purchased the app; I have to pay for it again if I want to download it. This goes for both iOS and  OS X App Stores.\nDoes anyone know of a way to download the apps I purchased while my Apple ID account country setting was set to Canada, after having changed the country setting to Norway?\nNote that I only have one Apple ID; I simply changed the country setting once to Canada when I moved there, and then back to Norway when I moved back.\nChanging my settings back to Canada while living in Norway is not an option, since I no longer have a Canadian address or credit card and, even if I did, I would not want the hassle of switching the country setting back and forth all the time.\n\nA: Another solution I've seen proposed is the following:\nCreate separate Apple IDs, one for each country whose store you have apps in.  Eg.\n\n\n*\n\n*bob.us@icloud.com\n\n*bob.ca@icloud.com\n\n\nOn your Mac, create separate user accounts, one for each of your Apple IDs.  Eg.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bob US\n\n*Bob CA\n\n\nMake sure each account is set up with iCloud enabled on their respective Apple IDs.  This should enable updates of your Mac apps.\nMove your iTunes library to a common location on your computer, out of your home directory.  Eg. /Users.  Make sure that all of your user accounts have full access permissions to the moved iTunes library (eg. by doing Get Info on the library and setting its permissions to Read & Write for Everyone).\nLog into each of your user accounts, start iTunes while holding Option (Alt).  This will allow you to select an alternative location for your iTunes library.  Find the library you just moved.  Do this for each of your user accounts, linking them to the same iTunes library.  Make sure each of your user accounts has iTunes started and logged into the store with its respective Apple ID.\nFor convenience, make sure \"Fast user switching\" is enabled in System Preferences, this will allow you to quickly switch between your accounts from the menu bar.\nNow, to sync your apps, switch to each of your accounts and open iTunes.  Finally, sync iTunes to your devices.  Note however that you must close iTunes in each account before you switch to the next; you should only have one iTunes open on this shared library at a time.\nIt's still a bit cludgy, but updates do work and it's much better than logging in and out of all your Apple IDs all the time or switching Billing Address all the time (which often isn't even possible).\nHere's to hoping Apple will at some point in the near future become marginally sensible and join the community of global thinkers.\n\nA: You can not transfer your Canadian account purchases (credentials) to a new account in Norway.\nYou have to log in to your Canadian account to retrieve your purchases. Your credit card is not relevant since you will not be purchasing new stuff.\nYou can create new (additional) account in Norway for new purchases.\n\nI would not want the hassle of switching the country setting back and\n  forth all the time.\n\nIf it is hassle for you switching the Store ID's then I have no solution for you.\n\nA: I was pretty much in the same situation as you and got the same answers from iTunes support. Like you, I did not want to manage two Apple IDs. So finally I just switched countries.\nHere is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I went to my purchased history before changing the stores and made a screenshot of everything I own (10 pages for iOS and two for OS X).\n\n*After switching countries, all the apps that I purchased are gone from the purchased list and if I search for an app that I previously bought, instead of getting the cloud icon I just get the price tag.\n\n*However if you click Buy it will ask you for your password, think for a few seconds and you will get a message, something like \"you previously bought this app so now it's free\" and you won't be charged. \n\n\nAs long as you know what you have purchased in the past, you can get in now for free.\n\nA: In the same situation: Bought an app in a country and now I'm living in a different country where I have the same apple ID but the credit card details (and hence the iTunes store) are set for the country in which I reside now.\nI've contacted Apple Support and they basically said that an app purchased in one country is not available in the cloud in another country. Pretty disappointing.\n\nA: I just had this issue recently i wanted to download a few apps from my previous country... and the apple consultants emailed me saying that I can just go ahead and re-purchase the apps and he'll redeem those (provided you hv proof of receipts). \nIt's a hassle & yes Apple should hv just allow us to merge apps no matter where on earth we buy the apps from. After all it's the same iTunes account & it's under Apple Store. \n\nA: News: up to 2017-10-05, iTunes in iOS can show past purchases after switching account region. Tested under US region (previously CHINA).\nI switched my account from CHINA to US at 2017-07-29, and was also very depressed by the fact that purchased became empty. But today I found all my purchased apps are back, I also confirmed with my friend who has the same problem with me, it seems Apple has finally fixed this after so many years. I didn't find a official announcement, but I still want to inform this news to the community, let's see if it really works globally.\nNOTE: try log out and log in before checking purchased.\n\nA: I have checked today (12 October 2017) on macOs High Sierra and iOS 11.0.3 and all my purchases from previous country store are back! Try yourself!\nI cannot however see apps that are not available in Polish store, which is understandable.\nBackground: I have switched US iTunes store to a Polish around 6 months ago. As I expected my past purchases were not listed in \"Purchased\" but if an app was available in US and Polish store than I could re-download without paying. But even then, items were not added to my purchased list. Now I can see everything. Even purchases from my family members who also switched country from US to Polish and we have connected as a family after that switch. It looks like Apple have changed their mind.\n\nA: After numerous phone-calls and emails back and forth with Apple, there is no ideal solution to this problem. Their solution is to change your account's country (which means that you'll need to provide a different credit card, etc.), if you wish to re-download an application which was purchased while you account was set to a different country.\n\nA: Instead of trying to update the apps through your computer, try updating all of them directly on your iPhone/iPad. For me it worked and then I transferred those purchases to my PC as well.\n\nA: In 2015, you just have to scroll into applestore the software you already purchased in other countries. Normally you will see the button with its current price.\nThen click on it, enter your iTunes password and you will see another textbook saying that you already purchased this article so you can download it for free.\nVery easy !!!!\n", "Q: Can I free up space on my iPhone 3GS taken by application data?

So after the Podcasts.app for iPhone got another update today, I once again got stuck with trying to manage my Podcasts, and once again it drives me crazy.\nCurrently I am wondering this: In iTunes 11 there is an \"Unplayed\" and an \"All Episodes\" tab for each podcast. This would suggest that \"All episodes\" lists, well, all episodes, nut that actually is not the case. If you delete an episode (right click -> delete) or you have auto-delete activated for a podcasts (for example \"keep only unplayed episodes\"), iTunes actually deletes those episodes from the \"all episodes\" lists. wait... what? Yep. So \"all episodes\" does in fact NOT necessarily display all episodes. If you ACTUALLY want to see all episodes, you have to go to the itunes store.  \nThe reason I am wondering about this is because I have limited hard drive space, and I wanted to activate auto-delete of podcasts and tell itunes to only keep unplayed episodes. The problem is that all played episodes disappear from my \"all episodes\" tab, which not only annoys me but also tickles my OCD bone in an unfriendly way.\nLong story short: If you don't want to simply keep all your episodes it seems to me that the user is required to delete every episode he already listened to, which in turn makes the \"all episodes\" tab pretty useless and dumb. Am I correct in thinking this? Or does anyone of you actually have a nice way of managing podcasts, including the podcasts app on the iphone?\n\nA: I've found that iTunes never reliably deletes podcast episodes. So I just delete them manually. \n\nA: This is old, but I was trying to figure this out too and noticed that if you right click a podcast on iTunes 11, there's an option called \"Show All Available Episodes\" which, it seems, restores the entire list of available episodes. Silly that you have to do this (in my opinion deleting a podcast file should just restore the Download button on the side of the podcast entry, same as iTunes Match), but this at least helps to 'reset' the state of that podcast in your iTunes library.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Thought I would weigh in...\nI am running IT 11.2.2\nI am using MBP 10.9.4\nThis may be a bit premature, but I believe I have found the solution to deleting podcasts permanently.\nOpen Finder>>>Music>>>Itunes>>Podcasts\nDelete manually (not my favorite)\nQuit IT, Don't close it, QUIT it\nClose the lid on your LT (just like the toilet)\nReopen LT, then iTunes \nThe files should be gone\nLike I said, this may be premature, but they haven't shown up\nSo Far So Good\nI am continuing to research this, and I have tried different protocols and nothing has caused the P/C to download \nAlso to note, for anyone who has had issues with a sign in window appearing when opening IT, it asks for a U/N and P/W\nNo, it is not a virus or someone trying to hack in\nIn my case the website for the software was mevio.com\nSimply find the P/Cast that is connected to it and delete it\nObviously you won't know until you find it, it is by trial and error\nGood Luck\nK\nI almost forgot,\nJust something to make you go \"Hmmmmm\"\nWhen I tried to log into Apple Support Communities to spread the word,\nthe response came back as the page could not be found and I had just been there 2 minutes prior\nI have tried and tried and cannot get on the site\nInteresting......\n", "Q: Can I use my @me.com address as my primary email address?

As we know iOS pushes apps to background after some time if you keep the phone idle.\nI notices that this doesn't happen with the native apps like phone, messages and mail.\nIt comes really handy when you are opening the mail app and it opens quickly. but any third party app like Gmail app for iPhone doesn't behave this way. each time I open it, it takes 1 minute to open.\nPush works perfectly though but opening the app takes lot of time.\nCan anyone advice on how to prevent that? there must be some tweak by which we can prevent selected apps from being purged after inactivity and make them available all the time?\n\nA: You can only prevent this on a jailbroken phone. Apple trusts its apps not to hog the battery and are OS-level apps so they can run in the background. All other apps from the AppStore are not first class citizens. When they go in the background, their state is saved and restored when they are opened again. This is to prevent them from constantly updating content and draining your battery.\nLong story short, you can only get that sort of control when you jailbreak. Note: if you are not careful and run many programs in the background after jailbreaking, your battry life will be really poor.\n", "Q: Window size of VirtualBox on mac I'm trying to install Windows by using VirtualBox on mac, but the size of VirtualBox don't fit the size of my mac.\nThe window size is too small, how can I make it fit my computer?\nBy the way, I'm using Retina macbook pro.\n\n\nA: You simply need to install the \"Guest Additions\".

There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. In iCal they are in a perfectly logical, organized order.  When I go to print, they appear randomly mixed around.\nI have attached some photos: The first is from iCal, second is what the pdf looks like. Note that not only does it re-order the events from the way they appear in iCal, but the way it is re-ordering the events appears to be changing at random from day to day: compare the blue events on the 17th and 24th in image 2 - these events are repeating weekly events and were not entered into the calendar manually. There is absolutely nothing different about the events on the 17th and the 24th, yet they appear in a different order on each of those days. The orange events are not repeating events and were each entered manually on their given days, but they too are being re-ordered randomly from day to day. I've noticed that this isn't just an issue for all-day events - the exact same problem occurs when multiple events occur at the same time (8am, for example).\nHas this just been accepted as an unfixable issue? Super frustrated, spent hours putting a year-long call schedule together for my residency program only to find it's a confusing mess when I try to print it or turn it into a PDF. If there is no solution, does anyone have suggestions for an easy to use app that I can use to generate a PDF calendar that looks similar?\n\n\nI am using a MacBook Pro with 10.7.5 installed.\n\nA: I have resorted to taking a screen shot of the full page view of my calendar using command-shift-3.  This saves the screen image to your desktop.  The image isn't as nice and bright, but it is in the proper order.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to your calendar in iCal\n\n*Open a specific date in 'Day View'\n\n*On the right hand side, you will see the date the events are taking place.\n\n*For each of your events, click on this date, it will bring up a red 'all-day' check box.\n\n*Uncheck this, then check it again.\n\nDo this for each event in the order that you would like them to appear, so the first unchecked/checked event will appear on top and the last unchecked/checked event will appear at the bottom.\nYou can see if this has worked by by going to File > Print. iCal orders the all-day events according to which was entered first, second, third. Sometimes further modifications to the calendar can throw it all out again.\n\n\n", "Q: Deeper knowledge of os x? I want to gain deeper knowledge of os x, which books/courses/forums should i take?

Ever since I moved to a MacBook Air from a PC about two weeks ago, I have had a problem in syncing my Yahoo Sent Mail on my MacBook Air with my iPad and iPHone. What gets synced is some old sent mail going back from 2010, rather than the latest.\nHow can this be rectified? \n\nA: The problem is likely to be that Yahoo Mail runs on POP3 normally as opposed to IMAP. Without going through all the technical details all you really need to know is that POP is all about the Server talking to you in one direction, your mail client isn't talking back, whereas IMAP is a two way street - as in, when you delete something in your mail client, it gets deleted on the server.\nSO, what has likely happened is you were running a mail client on your PC (like outlook probably), and when you delete mail that you've red or sent etc. or clear out any of your folders, it only deletes the mail on your PC, not on the server, and all your old messages are still there. What this means is a significant anti-clutter session may be necessary on your end of things.\nTo solve the problem for future, there is a way to setup IMAP mail transfer with Yahoo Mail, but rather than ramble on here I'm just gonna give you a link to this youtube video which will show you how to set it up.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: What's wrong with my Outlook search? Ever since doing OS X 10.8 updates, a pair of machines with Outlook refuse to look back further than 2 weeks during e-mail searches.  Spotlight settings all look OK.

Index does go away, but comes back the same way, only being able to search the last 2 weeks worth of items (and there are items going back years it should be finding).  Mailbox size is right around 1.9 GiB.  Ideas?\n\nA: I see this happen somewhat often in our office environment where Outlook 2011 is connected to our Exchange server. Typically a spotlight re-index will do the trick, either using the method you tried or by adding the HD to Spotlight's privacy pane, then removing it a few minutes later. Sometimes I have to go a step further & remove preference files. spotlight.plist, outlook.plist, etc... Beyond that I will sometimes be forced to rebuild the Outlook identity using the Microsoft Database Utility (hold opt while opening Outlook). Hope that helps!

I have a question similar to a previous one about ejecting before shutting down.\nIs it necessary or recommended practice to eject external drives before putting a Mac to sleep, whether it be via an explicit sleep command (e.g., from the Apple menu or other equivalent means), if Energy Saver puts the Mac to sleep, or the closing of a lid on a laptop Mac?\nEdit: To add a clarifying point, I do not plan to physically disconnect the drive before waking the Mac from sleep?\n\nA: It's neither necessary nor recommended (at least from what I've read).\nWhen you put the Mac to sleep, it will try and also put the external drive to sleep, thus parking its heads and turning off the drives. It won't eject it, however, so you can use it as soon as you wake your Mac again without having to mount it.\nThe benefit is that you don't have to worry about mounting it, as in most cases this would involve turning the drive off and on again, reconnecting the plug, or using diskutil from a Terminal—quite time consuming. Since I use my drive for Time Machine, I don't want to have to think about connecting it every time I wake my Mac.\nThe only downside I see is that you could accidentally plug the drive out. In that case, the Mac will wake up, and show you the error about a drive being disconnected without properly ejecting it. Since all data is written to the drive before going to sleep, this shouldn't cause any data loss though.\nAll in all, it's much more comfortable to just keep the drive mounted.\n\nA: I usually don't eject external drives before sleeping my machine. I went so far as closing my laptop, thus put it in sleep mode, wait a couple of seconds for it to enter sleep mode, then yank out the drive's USB cable. Later on, when the laptop wakes, it does not see the hard drive, but things will go on normally.\nUpdate\nYes, before putting the machine to sleep, I make sure quit all applications which use the external drive. Here is a common scenario for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*At the office, close the laptop to put it in sleep mode\n\n*After the laptop is in sleep mode, yank the USB cable to remove the hard drive\n\n*At home, re-attach the hard drive\n\n*Wake the machine up\n\n\nEverything should work as normal now.\n\nA: Maybe it's not necessary, but I would recommend ejecting drives before going to sleep, at least on a MacBook. It has just too often happened to me that I had to leave in a rush and then I didn't find the time to open the lid, eject the drives and putting closing it again – I just grabbed the Machine, pulled all cables and left – and that can be a quite bad idea, especially when working with FireWire connections... \n", "Q: How can I fix this pixelated Macbook Pro display malfunction? My Macbook Pro (Core 2 Duo - 2007) has seen better days. When I try to start, it simply boots to this odd pixelated image of the Apple start screen:\n\nI can only imagine that this is a display issue, but it's strange because there is a progress bar underneath the Apple icon that seems to move forward and then just hangs when it gets to the end. So the screen in the image is about as far as I can get.\nI've also tried connecting it to an external display, but I got the same results... the connection to the display worked, but the external screen showed the same lines of pixelation as the laptop screen.\nAfter looking at some of the Apple forums I tried a PRAM reset and a SMC reset but I'm not sure that they had any effect (I also couldn't get the Apple hardware test to run). But it seems like it must be a hardware issue as opposed to a software one.\nAnd in regards to how this might have happened in the first place... The laptop was running Netflix and does tend to heat up quite a bit while streaming video. The system became completely unresponsive after the pixelation problem showed up on the video and I had to shut down manually by holding down the power button. I haven't gotten it to boot up completely since then.\nSo I would think that the problem is hardware and not software. And I would also think it's not necessarily the display since the external display had the same issue. Is it possible that I fried the video card? Any ideas as to what parts I would have to replace to fix this? I'm thinking that it's probably time for a new Mac anyway as a long-term solution, but I'd love to be able to salvage this one at least in the meantime.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated because this kind of issue is definitely a first for me.\n\nA: I've seen issues similar to this. The problem was a bad video \"card\". The fix was to replace the whole motherboard because the video card is integrated and not seperate.\nEven if it is out of warranty and Apple retail store will diagnose this issue for you to confirm my diagnosis. They may also give you a cost to fix it.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It's because of discrete AMD Radeon HD GPU. I've installed gfxCardStatus and disabled AMD Radeon HD GPU. Now, I only use integrated Intel HD GPU without any problem.\n", "Q: Can two different phone numbers be used to receive voice and text on one iPhone? Can I have two different numbers asigned to the same iphone and receive text from both numbers on one device?\n\nA: The short answer appears to be no - regarding an iOS 6 device. It certainly isn't possible without jailbreaking. Also iPhone's Phone.app and Messages are clearly designed for a 1 phone number type setup.\nHowever, there may be some \"hacks\" that may work well for you. If I were you, I would look into Google Voice. It certainly isn't ideal, but may be the best you can get. What you can do is have things forwarded to your regular phone number. \nCheck out http://www.google.com/voice/.\nI believe you could work it so that you port one number into Google Voice, and then have your main/regular number on your iPhone in a standard way. When you get a call from your alternate phone number I believe it will forward it to your normal number and allow you to take the call normally. You can get the Google Voice app to text and call from your alternate phone number. The catch with that is that you will need data service - not just voice signal.\n\nA: The answer is absolutely yes, assuming you are in the USA.\nI do this myself using Google Voice. In fact, I don’t even know what my iPhone number is, I only give people my Google Voice number.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a new phone number from Google Voice\n\n*Enter your official iPhone number into your Google Voice account\n\n*Be sure to mark your official iPhone number as a “mobile” number which will allow you to receive text messages at that number.\nText messages sent to your Google Voice number can either be sent as text messages or as push notifications through the free Google Voice app. I use push notifications and send/receive texts through that app.[1] \nThe only potential downside is that these text messages are not being sent through Apple’s iMessage system. But I have not found that to be a particularly important detail. In fact, I have setup iMessage to start messages using my email address, not my phone number, so people who send/receive iMessages from me never even see my official iPhone number. (People who do not use iMessage would, but in that case I choose to use the Google Voice app instead.)\nCalls placed from your iPhone will show your official iPhone number in the caller-ID unless you use the Google Voice app, in which case your Google Voice number will appear.\nThe great thing about Google Voice is that you can filter incoming calls just like you filter your email. You can send some calls directly to voicemail. You can set it up so that calls from certain numbers get a “This number is not in service” message. You can set up different voicemail messages for different incoming phone numbers.\nYou can make it so that any call from someone not in your address book immediately goes to voicemail.\nRead that last part again.\nNo more calls from telemarketers or people you don’t know.\nYou can also make it so that an unknown caller (someone with blocker caller ID and/or someone who is not in your address book) has to give their name before they will be connected. (Your phone will ring, a voice will tell you that you have a call from… and then you will hear their name, then you will either accept the call or send it to voicemail.)\nGoogle Voice is my favorite and most irreplaceable service from Google right now. My only fear is that someday they’ll shutter it because it doesn’t make them any money.

This is my application -- it's not even signed. \nWhat could be the reason for that? I can reproduce this behavior on all my 3 macs.\n\nA: This is a status-by-design feature where an admin user can always override Gatekeeper and open an Application by right clicking the app in Finder.\nAn admin user can also change Gatekeeper settings or disable it entirely, so there's no real harm (in my eyes at least) in presenting a one-time white list dialog to ensure the admin user intends to allow a non-compliant (non-signed or non-Mac App Store) application to run.\n\nNow if you found a way for a non-admin user to bypass Gatekeeper, then I would expect filing a security vulnerability with Apple to get credit for finding a hole once they patch whatever implementation error was made to allow out of policy apps to run.\nApple documents this feature in depth on how to explicitly white list an application.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: About Gatekeeper\nGatekeeper is not malware protection and not a black list. It is a set of policies that allow first launch of properly signed applications and or validation of Mac App store receipts. If an admin user explicitly launches and then approves the running of non-compliant software, you have an education or policy problem as opposed to uncovering some flaw in Gatekeeper.\nIn detail, I have summarized (and mostly copied) the relevant sections of Apple's help on white listing any App so that Gatekeeper will allow it to run unhindered and unprompted:\n\nHow to open an app from a unidentified developer and exempt it from Gatekeeper\nIf you are confident the app downloaded from the Internet is the latest version and is from a source you trust, you can open an app\n  from an unidentified developer by following these steps.\nImportant: Some Apple screened apps from developers that are in the\n  process of acquiring Developer ID signatures will present the \"Open\"\n  option when they are double-clicked.\nNote: In most cases, you will only have to perform these steps once\n  for all user accounts on the Mac:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In Finder, Control-click or right click the icon of the app. \n  \n*Select Open from the top of contextual menu that appears.\n  \n*Click Open in the dialog box. If prompted, enter an administrator name and password.\n  \n  \n  Note: If there is an app that presents multiple Gatekeeper dialog boxes, you can temporarily use Gatekeeper's \"Always\" option. Make sure\n  to restore the Gatekeeper option that was there before to bring back\n  Gatekeeper function.\n\nYou can easily control who can white list Applications by not handing out Administrator user names and passwords to users that are not aware of this functionality and you also can manage gatekeeper from the terminal or profile manager and other managed settings software like Casper from JAMF. You can also audit your machines for software that has been white listed to periodically reset the list of allowed apps and determine who is exercising this function in case you wish to change policy and habit.\n\nA: If you have enabled this hidden preference, it also disables Gatekeeper:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false\n\nOr OS X allows opening all applications regardless of the setting in System Preferences.\n\nA: Gatekeeper prevents apps from being run by double-clicking, but you can always override it by selecting Open from the context menu.\nIf you can run downloaded unsigned apps by double-clicking, this is a problem with Gatekeeper. Files store their quarantine status in an extended attribute called com.apple.quarantine. If this attribute is cleared for some reason from your downloaded files, Gatekeeper will treat downloaded files as being no different from any other files on your computer. So I'd suggest that downloading a program and then using xattr -l filename in Terminal would be a good diagnostic tool if you have Xcode installed.\nIf you run them via the Open command from a menu, this is the designed behavior. Note that once you have run a program from the menu, it is forever enabled to be run by double-clicking, regardless of your Gatekeeper settings.\n\nA: Downloading a file over SMB will not trigger quarantining, and since the app is not quarantined the gatekeeper policy never gets checked. I'm not sure why it's being marked as quarantined on your other computers...\nTo check for quarantining at any point, use the ls -ld@ command to look for the com.apple.quarantine attribute:\n$ ls -ld@ /Applications/TextWrangler.app\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 3 gordon  staff  102 Apr 30  2012 /Applications/TextWrangler.app\n    com.apple.FinderInfo     32 \n    com.apple.quarantine     57 \n\nIf that quarantine attribute is attached to the app, the gatekeeper policy will be checked; if not, it won't. The interesting question is why it got quarantined on your other computers, and if you use this command to check the application at various points as you distribute it, you can figure out when the attribute is getting attached (and therefore why it's getting attached).\nEDIT: There's a note relating to this in the \"Click here for more details\" section of Apple's KB article #HT5290:\n\nImportant: Developer ID signature applies to apps downloaded from the Internet. Apps from other sources, such as file servers, external drives, or optical discs are exempt, unless the apps were originally downloaded from the Internet.\n\n", "Q: How to create a symbolic link with Quicksilver?

I have an old MacBook that I bought in 2006. I formatted and restored the original system. Everything was bad: I downloaded Skype, Chrome, and others, and every program said: \n\nThis software does not work anymore with this version of the operating system\n\n(or similar)\nSo I installed a version of Mac OS X 10.6 (the one I got with my old iMac) and now it seems to work fine. Sometimes a few programs crash, and so I thought installing 10.6 wasn't the right way to go either.\nWhat is the best way to handle an old MacBook with current versions of programs like Skype, Chrome, et cetera?\n\nA: Depending on what MacBook version you have, you may be able to install different OSes.\nHowever, what I do recommend is the best, and most stable OS that Apple has yet to ship: Snow Leopard, which is 10.6.X as you say. \nYou should do a fresh install – not from a iMac CD, but from an retail Snow Leopard disc!\nAll apps but few still support Snow Leopard.\n", "Q: Can I move System/User folders to separate disks? Here's the deal: I have a Macbook Pro 6,2 – I think late 2010 model. I have two mismatched drives with the same speeds. A 750GB Momentus XT, that SSD HDD hybrid, and the Seagate Momentus 500GB. Both are 7200 RPM. I replaced the optical drive a while back with a HDD.\nI want to install the most opportune parts of the operating system to a separate applications folder, therefore prioritizing on the outer edges of the disk – specifically files that will be run more often therefore they can be accessed quicker.\nHowever in addition, because they are mismatched in terms of GB per disk, I have a setup that I would like to use that further optimizes it.\nBasically the first disk is separated into 3 partitions (values approximate):\n\n\n*\n\n*System: 50 GB\n\n*User: 200 GB\n\n*RAID: 500 GB\n\n\nUsing Mac OS X' built-in software RAID, the RAID partition will be RAIDed with the second disk being the 500GB disk. Therefore it appears as three disks: a system disk, a user disk, and a RAID disk.\nHowever, I would like to separate the applications as well by partition – specifically by priority. System ones of course get high priority, granted I would like to move specific applications out of the Applications folder (honestly a lot of them like Photo Booth and FaceTime aren't really that helpful), however for the intent of this question I would like to know if the system can recognize and move the system folder as a whole to a separate drive, leaving just the system on the system partition.\nIdeally, I'd like:\n\n\n*\n\n*User preferences and Library on the system partition. \n\n*The user applications on the user drive for general things like Photoshop, Aperture, or Lightroom.\n\n*System applications on the User Drive\n\n*A special applications folder on the System Partition for high priority ones like Final Cut Pro, or Autodesk Smoke, things that will be accessed alot or use alot of reading and writing.\n\n*The User files and folders – you know, Documents, Pictures, etc. – on the RAID drive, along with a specific applications folder there as well for less used not as high priority applications such as optimization applications or smaller things like disk space programs etc. Text editor, or Espresso things like that, that don't need the speedier read and write.\n\n\nTherefore, in theory, the applications and system files used most often will be prioritized at the disk edges and therefore perform better, and if all goes well, it'd make Launchpad work nicely with all of this.\nI know most people's answer would be to buy an SSD which I'd really love to do, however it's not in the budget and since it is a MacBook Pro, space is limited. I'm trying to maximize storage with performance as well.\n\nA: Haven't tried all of the things you are asking, but I have succeeded in moving /users to another partition.  Mount it as /Volumes/Users, and make sure there is symbolic link from /Users to /Volumes/Users. \nThere is a bit of a dance:  Login as root.  Sudo doesn't work for this.\nmv /Users /UsersOld\nmount newdisk /Users\ncopy /UsersOld/* /Users\nfor each user: \n   chown -R his directory.\nYou may be chasing down ACL issues for a while.  \nYou may be able to do the copy with tar.\ne.g. cd /UsersOld; tar -cf - . | tar -C /Users -xvf -\nThis will do the right thing for permissions, but I don't recall if it does the right thing for resource forks and ACLs.\nYou may need to mount it at a different point, creating an appropriate fstab file with an entry for it.\nI would suggest that you enable root as a login account so you can have a GUI to snurfle around when things go pear shaped.\nAs to the efficacy of what you are doing:  It won't make much difference.  The read/write performance of having stuff at the edge vs spread out isn't much.  You're talking at best 20% or so, and more likely far less.\nIf you have not done so, max out the ram your laptop can hold.  This does far more for increasing performance than any other upgrade you can do, especially if you are using data pigs like photoshop.\n", "Q: How can root launch a regular Mac application from a cron job in /etc/crontab?

I live in Spain, and the routers are not meine nor accessible to me. Getting my private internet (ISP) is not a option.\n\nA: AFAIK there is no way to disable wireless network scanning. You can only disable the alerts about new wifi networks being found.\nMore significantly, because of the way wi-fi works, the transmission rate is going to be very very low due to all the stations interfering with each other.\nBut reading into your question at a deeper level, \"How can I get decent wifi\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Google \"pringle can antenna\" You will find a raft of recipes for high gain directional wifi antennas.  This can be used to select a given station out of the crowd.\n\n*This, by itself leaves you leashed to an ethernet cable to the external antenna, which you really don't want to move.\n\n*So you connect the pringles cantenna to your own wifi router, set it to broadcast on a seperate channel (ideally >3 channels away from the one the cantenna is listening to)\nFinally, you may find that the easier way to get anything done is to use a wired conection.\n\nA: How about setting up a wireless bridge and an new 802.11a ap?\nPurchase a l-com 2.4Gz bridge and 5Gz Ap.

With my iPad connected to my MacBook, I exported some Pages files to iTunes in docx format. Now I'm using my laptop without the iPad, and I want to find these files. Where/how are they stored? Tks.\n\nA: This is a 2 step process:\n1/ mark the files to transfer (Export) to iTunes while in Pages on the iPad,\n2/ once the iPad is connected, transfer the files from the IPad to the Mac.\nI fear you did not do step #2.\nIn Pages on the iPad, Export in .docx (or .pdf and .pages) format. This creates the file in the selected format and makes the file visible to the iTunes interface on the Mac.\nWhen the iPad is then connected in iTunes, go to the Apps tab > File Sharing section at the very bottom and select the Pages app & its documents. Select a filename or filenames from the list of files. Once selected, you must click the Save to... button to pull up a save dialog. You can then save wherever you like - local or external HD, networked NAS, webDAV server, USB key - whatever.\nNOTE: There is no default automatic downloading mechanism - you must first select the destination and then initiate the file transfer(s). If you didn't manually download the files from the iPad, they won't be on your Mac.\nTo avoid this in the future, I suggest you save your documents using iCloud, for example, or into Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and other apps Pages can access in iOS, and which can be retrieved by OSX and Windows. This will guarantee that an important doc is available whenever needed. I use all these technologies on a mixed environment of iOS devices, Macs & PCs.\n\nA: Files that get exported to iTunes on iOS don't automatically transfer to iTunes the next time you sync. \nA manual step is required: select the device in iTunes, then click the Apps tab and scroll to the bottom of the page.

The built in firewall handles only incoming connections, apparently.\n\nA: Please see the 2020 and 2021 edits below.\nThe original answer, unchanged:\nWhat you are referring to as \"the built-in\" firewall is actually the built-in Application Firewall.\nThere two other built-in firewalls in OS X Lion, pf and ipfw (the latter is being replaced by pf, but still exist in Mountain Lion). These can handle both incoming and outgoing connections and are typically controlled through command line scripts and settings. However, there are third party GUIs for these firewalls, e.g. IceFloor (for pf); WaterRoof and NoobProof (for ipfw). All these GUIs are free.\nThere is also third party software that can work as firewall, but doesn't use the built-in OS X firewalls. Examples are Litte Snitch and Hands Off (both paid). These can handle both incoming and outgoing connections.\nYou should be aware that there is some learning curve for these pieces of software, as their settings are not as simplified as the built-in Application Firewall.  Little Snitch or Hands Off could be easier to use compared to pf or ipfw or their GUIs.\n2020, first edit: ipfw is not being used in the current versions of MacOS. New (since the original answer from 2013) frontend of pf is Murus firewall (has free version with basic functionality, but the more advanced versions are paid). New application firewall is Vallum (paid). Some kind of light hybrid combination of Murus and Vallum is Scudo. Hands Off! is available at a new site. Free application firewall for outgoing connections is LuLu. And of course, Litte Snitch is still available.\n2020, second edit: As of macOS Big Sur, Apple apps can bypass the third party firewalls. There are some workarounds available, but these include disabling SIP (not recommended) or  enabling kernel extensions that may be disabled during macOS updates.\n2021 It seems that the firewall bypass in Big Sur will be removed in version 11.2 and third-party firewalls will be able to monitor and filter all of Apple's software.\n", "Q: How i can log various information of files in directory?

Each Time Capsule is connected via Ethernet with the WiFi set to \"off\".\nEach Time Capsule is assigned a unique static IP address; all devices connected to the network are assigned unique static IP addresses.\nThe Time Capsules randomly add IP addresses. Often the Time Capsule will have the assigned static IP address and two other unique IP addresses. It is truly a random occurrence. Sometimes there is only the assigned static IP address and then one or two additional IP addresses will be discovered to have been taken by the Time Capsule. Sometimes this occurs on only one unit and then it will occur on both. When the random IP address duplicates an assigned IP address for another device on the network, then the inevitable network address conflict error causes problems for the device operation.\nI have reset each unit in an attempt to solve the problem, but the random attaching of IP addresses continues.\n\nA: Here you can find the solution:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4890670?tstart=0\n", "Q: Stolen iPhone 4 not synced with my PC: are my videos backed up? Last week my iPhone was stolen when on holiday in New York. I have precious photos and more importantly videos of my son on there.

The camera roll includes both photos and videos taken on your device.\nSee support.apple.com/kb/HT4859 for more info about what is included in iCloud backups.\nIf there was no iCloud backup made, then it's unlikely that your data is recoverable since it was never synced with iTunes.\n", "Q: When I change my CSS and refresh the page, the changes aren't reflected in Safari or Chrome I set the background to red instead of the color it normally was.

It happens in both Chrome and Safari.\n\nA: Yes, the CSS is cached.\nTry holding down the \"Shift\" key while clicking on the refresh icon. This will usually trigger a refresh that will reload the CSS and JavaScript.\n\nA: It may be a browser caching issue and remedied as Dave suggested, however if that didn't work, it may also be that your hosting provider has a caching solution turned on for your server.  If clearing your browser's cache on Safari or Chrome, as Dave suggested, does not work for some reason, try calling your hosting provider or checking your cPanel to clear your servers cache.

If a process is run with nice (/usr/bin/nice in the default OS X Mountain Lion installation) will it run processes in equivalent time compared to that process being run without nice? Does the answer change if the system is heavily loaded vs. almost no other user processes?\nWhat I am hoping is that I can keep Handbrake translating my large collection of videos to H.264/Universal preset for Apple TV, while incurring little to no performance penalty to my other tasks such as Xcode. So can Handbrake be started (can any GUI program be started) with nice?\nIf it matters (don't think it does) the machine is a MacBookPro6,1, 2.66GHz i7 with 8GB RAM. RAM is often fully used according to iStat Menus but that's the maximum for this machine.\n\nA: Yes, you can run a GUI app with nice. For example, to run TextEdit with a niceness of 10:\nnice /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit\n\nIt really depends on whether handbrake is using more CPU or more RAM. Xcode is a RAM hog, and nice won't help there, but if it's CPU, you're good.\n", "Q: How can I reinstall Snow Leopard when my DVD drive is not working? How can I reinstall Snow Leopard when my external firewire DVD drive is not working?\nA few weeks ago I got the typical signs of drive failure so I got Scannerz and tested it (http://www.scsc-online.com/Scannerz.html) and the drive was certainly full of bad sectors so I decided to replace the drive. Today I finally had time to go to a local electronics store and get a drive. I installed the drive, which was a piece of cake. \nUnfortunately, about a year ago my optical drive failed (do these things EVER last???) so instead of opening up the unit and replacing it I bought an external FireWire optical drive. It works great, it's a half-height drive and if it goes bad I can easily replace it. It's easy to work with. I've made music CDs, backups etc. etc. without any problems\nWell, after putting the new HD in, I plugged in the FireWire optical drive, started the system while holding the alt key while booting, picked the optical drive with the original install media in it, and it starts booting. However, it never gets beyond the Apple with a white background with the spinner running underneath it. I hear noises coming from the optical drive that sound likes it reading, but it never gets beyond that.\nI thought maybe the media was bad, so I put it in another Mac and it could be read. I thought maybe the optical drive had gone bad, so I tested that in another system and it too is working fine. I finally put the media in the FireWire drive in another system and it reads it (won't install it, but I didn't expect it to since it's not the orignal system). Therefore, there is no problem with the FireWire drive or the media.\nIs there some trick I don't know about to get this thing to use the external FireWire optical drive for booting the install media? It's almost like it isn't being allowed to boot the system. I was thinking maybe I need to reset some parameters to make the FireWire a valid installation unit. Does anyone know anything about this?\n\nA: I have no idea why the FireWire external drive didn't work, but the following did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I took a neighbors Mac Mini and put it into target disk mode\n\n*I connected the Mini to my unit via FireWire\n\n*I put the media into the Mac Mini\n\n*I booted my unit holding the alt key down\n\n*When the list of available boot drives/media showed up, the OS install disk was showing up\n\n*I selected the optical drive (from the Mac Mini)\n\n*I installed the OS\n\n\nI have no idea why this would work but my external FireWire optical drive wouldn't. It was incredibly slow but it did get the job done.\nAlthough this is a solution, and maybe something that may be of use to someone else, I still have no idea why the external FireWire optical drive wouldn't work.\n", "Q: Is there a way to edit google spreadsheets offline on iphone?

(I created one in Virtual Box using the Windows 7 USB/DVD Tool)\nI then followed this tutorial on how to start the installation from within VMWare Fusion (http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/2156#), which seemed to work at first, but once I rebooted and selected the Windows Partition I got an error saying that windows could not be installed due to \"recent software or hardware changes\".\nI had selected the x86 version, so I figured I might as well try the x64 version and see if that makes a difference.\nSo I removed my bootcamp partition, created it again, went into VMWare after doing the same process as before, now I simply get a message saying \"No operating system found\".\nI'm wondering with my options are to actually install Windows without a superdrive or a bootable USB.\nCan I just copy the installation files to the bootcamp partition and \"make it start\"?\n\nA: Try using WinToFlash in creating your bootable USB.\nI also ran into problems when creating a Bootcamp partition. I also don't have access to a SuperDrive when I created a Windows partition.\nFirst, use WinToFlash on your Windows 7 iso. Please use at least a 4GB USB drive and make sure that you don't have any important files in that drive as WinToFlash will delete all files when creating the bootable USB. After creating the bootable USB, go ahead and create a Bootcamp partition in your Mac drive using this tutorial. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Not seeing my HD in the disk utility I tried to start up my computer and got a flashing file with a question mark. \nSo I held down the ⌥-key on boot and brought it into recovery-mode.\nAfter going through the different options I went to the disk utility and all I see is the grayed out SuperDrive and below there is disk0 and Mac OS X Base system. \nLeaving disk utility I went to reinstall Mac OS X. After the verification and agreeing the terms, it doesn't show my harddrive. \nDid I unmount the harddrive or what could the reason it's not showing up?\n\nA: I am assuming that you got a flashing folder with a question mark similar to this:\n\nThat means your Mac cannot find the boot loader.  \nNow, since you said that you were able to go into disk utility, you already know how to boot into Recovery Mode.  What I am assuming you saw when you were working in Disk Utility is something similar to this:\n\nThe SuperDrive being greyed out is probably because the drive is empty.  disk0 is typically the disk drive in your Mac.  Mac OS X Base System is more than likely a partition on disk0\nDo this:\nHold down the Option while powering on your Mac.  If there is a bootable partition, it will be listed (other than the recovery partition).  If so, boot into it.  \nOnce you have booted, check to see what you have selected as your startup disk (Preferences --> Startup Disk)\n\nA: My Mid-2012 Macbook Pro 13\" randomly stopped working due to this issue. I thought my 8 year old OCZ Vertex 4 SSD was the culprit since my 10 year old Vertex 2 died in a Toshiba laptop.\nThe problem was the internal thin black flexible cable (less than 1 mm thick) that connects the drive to your Mac's motherboard. This cable's copper is fractured and transmitting data incorrectly making your Mac believe that it cannot find the boot HDD or SSD.\nThe cable is the weakest link since it is sandwiched between your hot HDD/SSD and the rough brushed aluminium macbook.\nIn the future, place electrical tape on the rough aluminum to reduce abrasion. The electrical tape backing is quite a slippery and smooth rubber surface. Tape is not meant to hold the cable in place, it acts as a comfy bed for the cable.\nApple later made a thicker cable with a diferrent model number to address this issue. Fortunately it is easily purchasable for $10-25 on Amazon (as of 2021) and was pretty easy to install with only a small philips screw driver.\nThere are 3-4 different cables for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 macbooks so get the right one. Cables are NOT interchangeable since they come in entirely different lengths and won't fit right. The cable model number is written in white on your broken cable.\n\nA: Since you have access to internet, read this instructions how to solve your problem.\nBefore you hack around always try the safe boot mode first, that will automatically check and repair the disk (in most cases).\nIf not, then follow the instructions below:\nResolve startup issues and perform disk maintenance with Disk Utility and fsck\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS1417\n\nA: So I know this is super late, but I'd figure I'll mention it in case anyone else is having this problem, but sometimes this happens if there's no partition. Go back into drive settings in recover mode and re erase your main drive. This should create a little subsection underneath your drive that wasn't there before, usually named untitled. The next time you try to reinstall mac os youll find that partition usable.\n", "Q: Prevent TextEdit from opening for unknown file types that are plain text TextEdit is used by the system so it can't be removed, but I have another text editor I use and it causes confusion when text files that don't have a suffix or don't have a suffix which I've already associated with my real text editor open in TextEdit. \nAn example of this getting really strange in a workflow is if I've selected many files that I want to edit and open them all up at once, and some are in my real editor and others have opened in TextEdit in the background, but I'm unaware of that. Another example is simply knowing that I opened a file some time back, but not being able to find it anywhere in my text editor because it is actually sitting there in TextEdit. \nI don't mind that .rtf files or .doc files open with TextEdit but I would like to make it so that a plain text file of an unknown type or one which hasn't been actively associated with my real text editor will never open up in TextEdit. Is there any way to do that? I'm using 10.8.3.\n\nA: I think this answer here is what you're looking for:\nHow does Mountain Lion set the default text editor for the \"open -t\" terminal command?\nTo change default text editor to e.g. textmate, execute this command in terminal then restart:\n    defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add \n'{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.macromates.textmate;}'\n\n", "Q: Dmesg shows no timestamp The sudo dmesg command works fine, but shows no timestamp.

But you can use\nsudo fgrep \"kernel[0]\" /var/log/system.log\n\ninstead to get the same messages from the system log file, including a time stamp.\n", "Q: Mac: VRAM with multiple Monitors It seems that when multiple monitors are attached to a MacBook Pro (Retina), OSX splits up the VRAM for the monitors. Even when a screen is captured by e.g. a game, performance degrades very steep. The only thing that helps is to put the MBP in clamshell mode and remove one of the 2 attached displays to get back to reasonable performance.\nThe thing I don't understand is, why does the OS not allocate all resources to the captured display by default when it's captured? What's the reasoning behind this?\n\nA: The rule is if a monitor is attached, GPU needs to push content to it, therefore taking out memory space.\nThe good thing is, that space is quite small when a game is in fullscreen since it's just a big black canvas being pushed.\nThe bad news is, performance isn't degraded because of the VRAM, it's rendering units.\nEach GPUs is made up of different units specialized in performing different tasks. There's one kind of units that are specialized in rendering outputs.\nThat said, even if the retina display is blank, it still consumes a great deal of rendering unit's resources. That is what I think make the game slow.\nIt's like the difference between my recently purchased GTX 660 TI and 670. They are as good as each other in terms of calculation performance (texel rate, effects), but it has slower RAM and less rendering units. That makes it perform much worse in high resolution.\n", "Q: Producing a standard tilde while using OS X (U.S. International - PC) keyboard layout The tilde, ~, generated by the U.S. International - PC layout and the tilde, ~, produced by the U.S. layout are allegedly different characters.\nHow can I produce the U.S. tilde while using the International keyboard?\n\nA: To produce the standard tilde (U+007E) with US International PC you just type tilde and then space.  It will be exactly the same as what you get by typing tilde with the US layout.\n\nA: Press alt+N and then space for the standard tilde.\n\nA: Take a look at KeyRemap4Macbook if you want to permanently remap, it's got a tonne of options.\nAnother way to do this, if you're using Lion or above is adding to the PressAndHold IOS-esque feature.\nUkelele can allegedly do this, or take a look over here: Mountain Lion - Umlauts with english keyboard layout\n", "Q: TODO manager with hierarchical TODOs? I use KDE4 on my Linux machines, one of the tools I use a lot is KOrganizer. I love its TODO list which supports hierarchical (nested) tasks.\nCould someone recommend a similar application for Mac? If it could synchronize with CalDAV server, that would be great. So far I failed to find any such tool.\n\nA: This might be more than what you're looking for, but OmniFocus is the best solution that I'm aware of that meets your stated requirements.\nIt does do nested tasks.  If you're a fan of Getting Things Done, OmniFocus will feel pretty familiar to the workflow described therein.  If you're not into GTD, OF still works, although the terminology might not feel quite so obvious.\nIt supports WebDAV, not CalDAV.  If you're running your own CalDAV server, you might be fine here.  If sync (not necessarily CalDAV sync) is your real goal, the Omni Group has an Omni Sync Server that's available to all of its customers, and it works well.\nThere are also OmniFocus apps for iPhone and iPad, which have generally good reviews.\n\nA: My suggestion would be to keep both things separated: TODO-List manager and calendar app.\nI would recommend the in-built iCal as calendar app on your Mac. Here, you can use a service like Google Calendar for syncing with another calendar app on your Linux machine. \nIf you want a really good TODO list manager, which is also available for different mobile platforms, I would recommend WUnderlist 2, it also has a beautiful web interface that you can use from your browser, so there is no need to install it: http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist\n", "Q: Parallels window problem I'm using Parallels on my mac. But when I open a software the font are so small, it's very weird. Can anyone help me out!!!\n\nThe picture above is when I open up my chrome, how can I fix it?\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. I went a different route, and decided to sacrifice the nice high-DPI of the Retina for a scaled solution that makes everything look right.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Parallels VM Config → Hardware → Video → Resolution\nUse: Scaled\nNot: Best for Retina, More Space\n\n*Restart VM\n\n*Windows Display Settings → Set Resolution: 1280x800 + Apply\n\n*Windows Display Settings → \"Make text and other items larger or smaller\"\nUse: Smaller (100%)\nLate-2013 rMBP 13.3″ with Parallels 9.0.23350 and Windows 7\n\nA: I've seen this particular problem many times, and a lot of it has to do with how Windows handles DPI scaling.\nSince you are using a Retina MBP - which has an extremely high resolution, you'll want Parallels to manage the DPI of your Windows VM. You can do this under your Virtual Machine's configuration, Hardware, Video Options, and select \"Best for Retina\".\n\nThe next time you reboot, Windows will have its DPI set to 199% (why not 200% I'm not sure).\nThe only trick to this is when you connect to an external display and you want to show your Parallels VM there. Windows can't change it's DPI without a full logout / login - so if you change displays you'll have to log out of Windows and log back in.\nThe next problem is that Windows does DPI scaling differently - some programs do not respect Windows DPI scaling. It's very bad practices for developers, but some of them always assume a fixed number of points-per-inch, like 96. Windows does its best to fix these issues by bitmap scaling the Window, and translating input, but it won't ever be perfect and it will look like a JPG that's 200% zoomed. It all depends on the program you are using. As unfortunate as it sounds, the best browser on Windows for retina resolution / DPI is Internet Explorer 10.\n\nA: I have a new solution for this,set the video properties to \"Scaled\" and the video memory to 256MB.\n\nOne's you do this , go back to your windows--> Control Panel --> Display --> Set it to Smaller(100%).\ncheck the Screen Resolution now it shows 1436*756 on a Mac Book pro 15.6 Retina.\nThis is done automatically , do not set it manually.\n\nA: All my coworkers had the same problem. In Parallels 9, you can set for every VM if it should be scaled, best for retina or more space. As DPI scaling under Windows is inherently broken, as application developers have to support this, and many just don't, it's not useful you can configure this at all, which is why more options don't always mean better software (looking at you Parallels). In versions before, Parallels didn't let you choose the wrong things, and didn't have the wrong defaults.\n\nYou need to open the VM, go to the Virtual Machine menu item in the Macs menu bar, go to Hardware -> Graphics -> and click on scaled, restart your VM, in the Windows VM, go to Start -> Control Panel -> Display Settings -> click the link \"Make text and other items larger or smaller\" -> set it to 100%\n\n\nA: The solution of this problem is here...

I really love AirPlay so I thought about buying a second AirPort Express for another amplifier in the apartment. But will my iPhone5/iPad2 be able to stream to both AirPlay devices simultaneously?\n\nA: No, you want be able to stream music to two airport express units simultaneously from an iOS device such as an iPad or iPhone. \nHowever, you can stream simultaneously from iTunes running on a Mac or PC.\nFor example, you can't have speakers playing in the kitchen and speakers playing in the dining room at the same time unless they are connected to the same airport express.  If you have them connected to two airport expresses, you can choose kitchen or dining room but not both. \nYou can play to both if you stream from a Mac or PC using itunes.  However, there are apps that will let you control the Mac or PC from your iOS device but you can't do it natively.     \n\nA: to stream itunes to single/multiple/all airplay devices, you will need multiple airplay devices, itunes on a pc or mac (ensure this itunes has your favorite library), then from any ios device, download and install Apple Remote App.   remote app allows you to \"remotely\" control the Itunes library on the pc/mac, allowing you to multi select your airplay devices right from your phone.   looks, feels, is exactly like Ipod/Music app on your ios device.\ni have been using it for years, but still waiting for a NAS maker to include this 'Itunes SERVER Airplay\" functionality right in their firmware.

Because the lag is sometimes more than 30 seconds.\n\nA: This seems to depend on how your Notifications are configured. If you have your notifications set to Banners, the order will be Watch first, Phone second, Mac last (if unopened on Watch and Phone). If you have your notifications set to Alerts the order will be whichever device is open currently and then the rest of the devices will not receive the alerts. Thus if your Mac is open you will receive an Alert and none of your other devices will receive it.

Before the reboot, it told me something like:\n\n“None of the updates could be installed. An Exception occurred.”\n\nSince that moment, whenever I try to log in, I end up in the infamous “login loop”: I enter my password, see a gray screen for about 20 seconds, and end up on the login screen again.\nOS X version\n$ sw_vers\nProductName: Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.8.3 \nBuildVersion: 12D78\n\nOS X update\nThe update consisted of four parts, one of them being iTunes (I think iTunes has never worked after I upgraded to OS X 10.8; this was probably an iTunes 10.6 - 10.8 upgrade or something?). The other three I don’t remember.\nWhat I’ve already tried\n\n\n*\n\n*I’ve tried to log in as another user. Same problem. So it doesn’t seem to be user-specific. \n\n*There are a lot of posts out there suggesting that it may have something to do with a corrupted launch service cache. There was indeed a file named “com.apple.LaunchServices-034501.csstore” (as suggested by posts below) on my machine. I removed it (in Single-User mode). Didn’t help...\n\n*\n\n*http://dltj.org/article/macosx-launchservices-login-loop-fix/\n\n\n*File system check:\n\n*\n\n*fsck_hfs -r -f -y /dev/disk1s2\nHelp!\nThe log files are too large to include here. I'll try to paste some (to my own judgement) relevant stuff in the comments below. \nThe OS X update took place around Mar 24 13:50. At 13:52:32 I see the first “Exit timeout elapsed (20 seconds).” (I think this is the log in timeout). \nSome errors in the log file were there before Mar 24 13:50, so I guess they’re harmless (like “The following StartupItems failed to start properly”).\nAll help highly appreciated because I'm stuck. Also, if you know of a forum that's more suitable for this kind of problem, please let me know!\nCheers\n\nA: I started OS X in recovery mode (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718) and chose \"Reinstall OS X\". This downloads OS X from the internet and reinstalls it. The download took me some 2 hours, installation another 40 minutes. Problem fixed. \nI was afraid this reinstall would completely format my drive, and install OS X from scratch. But everything seems still intact. My (and all other users) home folder is still there, 3rd party apps in /Applications are still there. And everything is still working.\nI never heard of this built-in Recovery System in OS X. Good to know it exists.\n", "Q: How do I add custom DNS server and preserving default DNS of ISP in OS X Mountain Lion I'm using OS X Mountain Lion. I'm using dnsmasq to set up wildcard localhost domain names, such as http://local.dev, to point to localhost. But I have to add 127.0.0.1 in my system preference -> network settings.\nAfter I set up 127.0.0.1 as the DNS server, the ISP's default DNS servers were over wrote by mine. This was preventing me from accessing websites. It's not a big deal when I don't move my computer, I could manually enter the ISP's DNS server. But if I change places, the ISP's DNS changes.\nI also tried to use google's DNS server, but it's not working in some instance. How can I reserve (or update) the ISP's DNS server without deleting 127.0.0.1 as a DNS.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Yep. You can do this, /etc/resolver is your friend.\n$ man 5 resolver: \n\ndomain\n  Domain name associated with this resolver configuration.\n  This option is normally not required by the Mac OS X DNS search system when the resolver configuration is read from a file in the /etc/resolver directory.   In that case the file name is used as the domain name.\n\nSimply put you can place nameserver 127.0.0.1 inside a file you create called /etc/resolver/dev\nYou'll need to reload/restart. It'll then direct any requests to *.dev to your local nameserver.\nYour network connection DNS remains on automatic, so it will cope with any changes in your environment.\nEdit: I've just found https://serverfault.com/a/164215/163311 and http://www.echoditto.com/blog/never-touch-your-local-etchosts-file-os-x-again which have a few more details and include dnsmasq setup details.\n\nA: Is there a specific reason for using dnsmasq? \nYou could simply add entries to your /private/etc/hosts file leaving DNS pointed to whichever ISP you happen to be connected to. Here's how to do that using Terminal:\nsudo nano /private/etc/hosts Enter you password when prompted.\nAdd any additions at the end of the hosts file (a single entry per line), for example:\n127.0.0.1   local.dev\nControl + O and then enter to save the file within nano. Control + X to exit nano.\nYou'll than need to flush the local DNS cache using: dscacheutil -flushcache\n", "Q: Copying file from Windows PC keeps failing I've set up sharing of my MacBook on my home network. It doesn't show as visible but I can access it at \\jdxmacbook from the Windows PC.\nHowever when I try to copy a file, it starts OK but after about 10s I get a \"can't access\" folder error. However from Explorer I can still view the MacBook folders just fine.\n\nI don't have a USB stick with a spare 2Gb for the file so if I can't get this to work, I'm screwed... it happens every time\nWhat is causing this problem when I see no problems transferring large files between other devices on the network? It seems to be either a problem with OSX, or OSX/Windows communication, or the router in some way...\n\nA: My first troubleshooting question is: Have you tried to copy other files from that computer to your computer, and does the file copy process fail in the same way with other files? If not, then the copying problem you are having is only with that one file on the other computer. It may be a corrupted file, in which case the problem is not with the copying process; it is with one corrupted file.\nSecond, is this something you need to do frequently with many different files, or do you just need this one file? It might indeed be better to spend US$6.00 on a 2GB USB stick, which you can certainly re-use for other purposes later.\nThird, are your computers connected to the router via WiFi, or via Ethernet cables? If it is WiFi, can you hook them up with Ethernet cables instead? These kinds of file copy processes usually work better over Ethernet than over WiFi.\n\nA: I cannot see how to add the quick answers...\nmy network appears very stable except when I try and do anything involving the Mac\nWhat other problems are you experiencing?\nHave your tried a smaller file.\nWhat is the size of the file you are trying to copy?\n\nPerhaps you could share a windows folder and copy the data that way.\nRobert\n", "Q: icloud backup storage issues I'm not able to backup my ipod because I have more than 5gb and don't want to pay more. I would love to just put my camera roll on backup, and I deleted the backup for everything else but it still says I have too much gb on it! All I want is my camera roll! \n\nA: If the size of your camera roll is bigger than the available 5.0GB of space then you won't be able to back up to icloud unless you delete some of the content in your camera roll. Make sure by going into Settings>iCloud>Storage and Backup>Manage Storage that email, and other documents and data aren't using up any space. You can press edit and delete those if you don't need them.\n", "Q: Does OS X enforce a maximum filename length or character restriction? What is the maximum filename character length of files in OS X?\nOf secondary importance is whether some characters are allowed/disallowed in addition to any overall length restrictions.\n\nA: Yes - you should keep file names to 255 characters but paths can be longer but not as long as some other unix allows.\nThe desktop OS X supports ten major filesystems (HFS, HFS Plus, UFS, WebDAV, UDF, FAT, SMB/CIFS, AFP, NFS, and FTP) with several variants of some of these. See table 1 at developer.apple.com's article below for details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Overview of OS X File Systems\nThe system default filesystem, HFS plus supports filenames of 255 UTF-16 encoding units and the only reserved character is : which is used internally to denote a directory change as opposed to / which normally is reserved to signify a directory change rather than belonging to the name of the file. (ok - I believe 0x00, the null character also is forbidden in HFS+)\nBy convention, software should use file handles and are responsible for allocating enough space to contain an arbitrarily long file path if it doesn't use standard API for navigating the filesystem structure to locate a 255 length filename.\n\nA: From the font of all knowledge, the maximum file name size in the default HFS+ file system is 255 UTF-16 encoding units, so basically 255 characters. Technically, any unicode character can be used, but this may be practically limited by the application you are using - for example, the / character is used to delineate directories in pathnames, so you may not be allowed to name a single file stuff/things.txt, as this means \"the file things.txt in the stuff directory\" to the operating system. There are ways of \"escaping\" characters like / in filenames, but for general use it's discouraged.\n", "Q: Can't enable Apple Two Step Authentication I see from all of the various blogs and news sites that Apple finally has two step authentication with their Apple ID. That's great -- especially with the latest security hole where you can now reset someone's Apple ID password with just the ID and the user's birthday.\nHowever, I don't seem to be able to turn on two step authentication:\nHere's what I do:\n\n*\n\n*Go to https://appleid.apple.com/\n\n*Click on the Manage Your Apple ID button.\n\n*Sign in.\n\n*Click on Password and Security.\n\n*I'm now asked my security questions.\n\n*I answer my security questions.\n\n*And, now I can change my password, security questions, my rescue email, and my birthdate.\n\nWhy can't I turn on Two-step authentication? Am I not going to the correct place? I'm trying to follow the directions on Apple's website, but I don't get the two-step verification option.\n\nResponse:\n\nWhen I first went to the Password and Security page. I answered the questions. And then got the normal setting page for Password and Security. But I could not see an option for the two-step. What I missed was its above all the settings. You may be doing the same. Thats an actual screen shot of the top of the Password and Security page and show the \"Get started\"\n\nNope. I don't see that...\n\nI'm going to see if I can contact Apple tomorrow on this. Maybe take my Macbook to the Apple Store tomorrow.\n\nA: I missed it the first time. It should be at the top.\nof the the Security page.\n\n\n\n\nA: Unless your password is a complex one and has been changed recently, the most logical problem is that your password isn't new enough for the system to offer you the two-step authorization change.\nIt is a bit of a pain to change the password (since you will need to change it everywhere - perhaps multiple times on each Computer and iOS device), but once you've made a new password, you should be able to quit your browser and then log in anew and see the request two-step authorization wording and controls.\nDo note, that you may have to wait at least 3 days from the time you changed your password to request two-step, and once you request it, you may have a second 3 day wait period to ensure that all the emails Apple sends have a chance to be delivered.\nThis is to protect you from someone else enabling two-step authentication and allow you to contact Apple and stop your account from being hijacked.\nAlso, I wouldn't go to an Apple retail store for support with Apple ID. They can't log in to your account or do anything but help you fill out the web form for support. Yes, they may have someone who knows how it's supposed to to work, but your details show you understand how it should work and you might just need to open a support ticket with Apple ID support if you can't enable things yourself.\n\nA: Either your address is blank or you are from country where this feature hasn't been rolled out yet. I changed country to USA and i showed up right away. \n\nA: I guess it was a slooooowww rollout. I checked a few weeks later, and found the two step authentication offered, and filled it out.\n\nA: I was so upset when I got my phone Ana found that I had to wait for 2 days for the two step authorization.  Here is what I did.  I created a new Apple ID using a different email address I already had (you can't use an apple url address), I used a gmail account.  Then I set it up and created a password thru apple. Just go into your iCloud from the menu, scroll to the bottom and sign out.  Then replace it with the new temporary account until your 3 days pass and you can log back in to your original Apple ID.  It worked!  I can use the watch now!!! \n", "Q: WD Passport External USB Drive - Really slow on Macbook I just got a Western Digital 2 TB \"My Passport\" USB drive and connected it to my macbook pro (it says it supports USB 3).  But when I tried to copy my photo library it said it would take 40 hours?\nWhat could be going on?\nDetails: I'm on a Macbook pro 8,1.  With OSX 10.6.8.  I formatted the drive with Mac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n\nA: That seems very slow. I have a MyPassport, which is a portable, self-powered drive. When I got it, I found the copies to be slow, but I found that WD has drivers for the drive that speed the copy up considerably. I'm not entirely comfortable having a third-party hard disk driver, but I haven't encountered any problems with it.\n", "Q: How can I open something in Mac with same Application every time I want to play videos always by VLC or GOM player but when I chose Open with-other-then I chose the App and I check for \"always open with\" = it does work but not all the movie in same extention  will work!! I need all the time do the same cyrcl agian and agian?? the same thing with Picturs I don't like the default app\"Preview\" and I want to use XEE with same way but when I restart my mac I see Everything back to default.\n\nA: Ctrl click or Right click on the item then select Get Info from the popup menu (or else select the item and select Get Info from the File Menu). When Get Info window is open you can select what app to open it with and choose to open all similiar documents with the new app as well.\n\nA: Go to this link .

I have two connected network interfaces, ethernet and WLAN.  How does OSX handle traffic in this situation? When outgoing messages are sent which interface are they sent from? If I use tools such as Logmein.com, which interface does it connect through?\n\nA: It depends on the service order set in System Preferences->Network. The first one that has a route to the requested endpoint will be used.\nClick on the wheel icon at the bottom left and choose Set Service Order.... Then drag the items into the required order.\nThis is the order on m machine which I do not think I have altered.\n\n", "Q: AT&T Apple IPhone IOS 4 I would like to know how to block a specific phone number from calling or texting my phone. How do I do this on my phone?\n\nA: Technically, you can not block calls on your iPhone. If you want to block a caller, you have to contact your carrier.\nSome phones enable call rejection but, alas, the iPhone is not one that does. Note that call rejection means the call still reaches your phone, but software in the phone prevents notification of the call from reaching you. Call blocking means that the call never reaches your phone, it is cut off by the carrier and never routed to your phone.\nHowever, if you want to make it a little bit easier to ignore the offending caller, you could set up a contact for the caller's number, set the ringtone to a silent ringtone, vibration to Nothing, the text tone to None and the text vibration to Nothing. You'll still see notifications when the caller tries to reach you, but this is the best that you can do without contacting your carrier.\n", "Q: Find/Unrar/Delete Script I'm a PC convert, and quite novice when it comes to shell/bash scripting, but I really want to learn/understand more.\nMy need: I need to be able to scan a folder, find any .rar files, extract the files in place, and delete the associated .rar afterwards.  Each may also have the .r00, .r01, ... files associated, so those need to be deleted afterwards as well.\nCan someone help me figure out (and understand) how to write a script for this?  The more comments, the better.\n\nA: you could do something like this:\nfind . -iname '*.rar' | xargs unrar x\n\nfind . -iname '*.r*' | xargs rm -f\n\nthe script works as follows: it searches recursively for rar files in the directory you are in (the dot)\nit pipes all results to an argument list (xargs) that is passed through to the command 'unrar'\nSame in the second line, but now it is passed to remove (rm). The -f flag makes sure that the files are deleted instantly, you won't be asked for your permission.\nThe rm -f  is a powerful command that you should use carefully, so think about what it would remove if you would execute it before you delete it, or just test this by doing:\nfind . -iname '*.r*'\n\nOne thing about the unrar command: unrar is not a standard command in Mac OSX (not sure if this is the case in other Linux/Unix distributions), so make sure you have it installed on your machine.\n\nNote: There is a fine but important difference between find . -iname *.r* and find . -iname '*.r*' relating to the way Unix shells handle wildcards:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the first form, wildcards are expanded by the shell (so the shell will look for all files/folders matching *.r* in the current directory and pass these as parameters to find. This will work ok if there is one file to match anyway but will fail if there are several (because then the call is find . -iname foo.rar bar.rar but -iname only takes one argument).\n\n*In the second form the pattern (without the '') is passed to find and the wildcard expansion is done by find (which then tries to match every file it finds).\n\n\nSo in general patterns passed to find should be enclosed in '' to produce the desired result.\n\nA: I assume you only want to scan the current folder (and not all other folders beneath it):\nfor rarfile in *.rar; do\n    unrar x \"$rarfile\"\ndone\n\nKey thing is to put the file name into \"\" when passing it to unrar to avoid any problems with spaces in the name.\nNow if you want to have this as a script you can run, you can do the following\n cd ~\n mkdir .bin \n echo 'PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.bin' >> .profile\n echo 'export PATH' >> .profile\n . ./.profile\n nano .bin/extract_all_rars\n\nThis gives you a simple editor for text files, essential commands are displayed at the bottom. Type\n #!/bin/bash\n\nfollowed by the code block at the top, save the file and exit. Then (in the shell again) type\n chmod +x .bin/extract_all_rars\n\nto mark it executable (so the shell recognizes it as a command).\nAutomatic deletion has one caveat: unrar doesn't return an error status if things go wrong so you may loose your rar files. If this is not an issue, adding\n rm -f \"$rarfile\" ${rarfile%%.rar}.r{0..9}{0..9} \n\nafter the unrar in the loop above will do the job. The second parameter is used to create all possible .r04 suffixes by first stripping away the suffix (${rarfile%%.rar}) and then iterating from 0 to 9 twice to get all possible combinations (run echo foo{0..9} in bash to see how it works). As most of these file names do not exist, I've added -f as an option to avoid error messages.\nIf you are fairly sure that no other files with a .rXX suffix are in the same directory, a simple\nrm -${rarfile%%.rar}.r??\n\ndoes the trick as well.\n\nIf you don't have rar/unrar already:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download RAROSX 4.2 from rarlab.com\n\n*In Finder, open ~/Downloads and double click the downloaded file to unpack. A rar folder will be created\n\n*Open Terminal and run the following commands\ncd ~/Downloads/rar\nsudo install -d rar unrar /usr/local/bin\n\nto install the binaries (executables)\n\n*We must also make sure that the shell afterwards finds the binaries\ncd ~\necho 'PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> .profile\necho 'export PATH' >> .profile\n. ./.profile\n\n\nA: I use unar, which is a command line version of The Unarchiver.\nThese also work with paths that contain spaces:\nfind . \\( -name \\*.rar -o -name '*.r[0-9][0-9]' \\) -print0 | xargs -0 unar\nfind . -name '*.r[a0-9][r0-9]' -exec unar {} \\+\nfind . -name '*.r*' -delete\n\nOr if you install Bash 4 and add shopt -s globstar to ~/.bash_profile:\nunar **/*.r*\nshopt -s extglob; printf %s\\\\n **/*.@(rar|r[0-9][0-9])\nrm **/*.r[a0-9][r0-9]\n\n", "Q: Spotlight for currency conversion I know that Calculator app has ability to convert currencies but is it possible to get this shortcut in Spotlight like that:\ncurrency 100 USD to GBP\n\n\nA: Well, there is a way, actually.

This will do a Google search for your conversion, and you'll get a figure and a graph.\n\nA: You can use Spotlight like this\n\n", "Q: How can I disable the HD4000 integrated graphics card on a MacBook Pro? HD 4000 on my MacBook Pro shared 512 MB RAM from my main memory, which is calculated as part of kernel_task.\nMy question is simple, is there a way to disable it, stopping it from taking up 512 MB of memory and just use the 650M in all situation.\nI can of course not use it with the option under Energy Saver, but that doesn't return the precious memory it steals. \nAny idea will be appreciated, I am thinking sysctl?\nEDIT July, 2013\nThings just got worse as I now see HD 4000 taking not 512 MB but 1024 MB out of my main memory. I am not sure if I was wrong the last time around but it is definitely a bigger issue now.\nEDIT 2 July, 2013\nThe 1024 MB report from both System Profiler and About This Mac seems to be flawed. After reminded by Bart Arondson to look at Activity Monitor. It still just takes up about 512 MB. My guess is that the shared memory part is dynamically adjusted, I will try to dig deeper.\n\nA: Use gfxCardStatus - it lets you choose which graphic card to use.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect a microphone to an iPhone/iPad via WiFi and use it instead of the built in one? It is possible to connect a microphone to an iPhone/iPad using bluetooth, BUT would it be possible to achieve the same kind of connection with a microphone but over a WiFi network?\nTo explain: I have a microphone that is connected to an router via WiFi, would it be possible in some way to connect the iPhone/iPad to this microphone and use it instead of the built in microphone?\n\nA: it is possible to do it through bluetooth, dock connector, and 3.5mm headphone jack!\nin order to use it though wifi you need a compatible application and i have never heard of such thing! after a little goggling all i found was bluetooth connected ones, because it offers a P2P connection witch is much more reliable!\n(sidenote) mics though wifi routers could, be unreliable, specially in poor connection!\nhowever there are mic's that include a dock connector dongle for a stable P2P connection \nsomething like this\n\nA: You could use an app like Facetime or Skype to create a streaming link between your iPad and another network-connected device (smart phone, iPad, iPod, computer). This would allow the remote device to serve as the \"microphone\" that would serve as audio input to your iPad and allow you to monitor and/or record the audio from the remote device.\n", "Q: A calendar embedded in OS X desktop that allows me to cross off days I workout - does something like this exist? I'm getting into an exercise routine and in the past I've found it helpful to cross off the days tha I do exercise on a calendar. It occurred to me that I spend far more time looking at my macbook desktop than at my bedroom wall and would like to know if anyone is aware of an application that will allow me to have a calendar with at least one full month showing at a time embedded on my desktop, and allow me to cross off the days that I work out?\n\nA: Use the build in calendar (came with osx), open it, click on the (+) sign to add new event for today, type worked, then you have lots of options to use if you want to, but that is the simplest way to do it.\nYou can even make a new calendar specific to your activity.\nYou can email the event to yourself, etc...\n\n\nA: Perhaps Fantastical fits the need?\nIt still doesn't allow for an embedded calendar that is fully visible all the time on the Desktop, however it does add it to the menubar for quick access.  It integrates with your current calendar (iCal, Calendar, Outlook, etc) and allows for quick adding of appointments by clicking the menubar icon and typing a bit.\nIf I were making this solution for myself I'd imagine it along the lines of this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Calendar / iCal, create a new calendar called \"workouts\"\n\n*Download and install Fantastical\n\n*Click on the menu bar icon for Fantastical\n\n*Ensure that the calendar is set to workouts\n\n*Type in something along the lines of \"Worked out today\" and save it\n\n\nSeems like that would work relatively well, allowing for convenience without being too intrusive.\n", "Q: Remove unnecessary backups from TimeMachine to get space I know that oldest backups are removed automatically when there is no space for new ones on TimeMachine. I use TimeCapsule also for sharing files on WiFi, so I’d like to free some space by removing of unnecessary backups: \n\n\n*\n\n*Large files which needen’t to be backed up (e. g. image previews of Lightroom over 1 GB). I have excluded them in TM preferences but they are already present in older backups keeping space forever. \n\n*Oldest backups I know I will not need. (So to trigger the same as TimeMachine does automatically but earlier than disk gets empty).\n\nA: I use this article to help me in deleting files from Time Machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nhttp://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2655/time_machine_delete_files_folders_from_backup/\nIt talks about removing all the backups of a single file, maybe it's not what you're looking for, but it definitely could resolve the first issues (Lightroom previews). In practice, it's easier to delete all backups of one file or all files in one backup than it is to go in and remove only one file from one backup.\nHere's a brief summary of that article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Time Machine\n\n*Select the folder/file you want to delete from your backups\n\n*Through the \"option\" menu in the Finder menu bar (ctrl-click is not available in TM, don't know why) select \"Delete all backups of selectedfile\", where selectedfile is (obviously!) the file you selected.\n\n\nA: If you want to delete a backup from a certain date, there is a solution for that. I saw it from this screencast:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the time machine icon on the menu bar, click enter time machine.\n\n*After your desktop goes into the stars animation, you should be able to see a list of dates of your backups on the right.\n\n*Go to the backup date that you want to delete\n\n*In the middle, click the gear icon and click Delete Backup.\n\n*Type your password when prompted\n\n\nA: I wrote a bash script to delete all the backups but the latest since the ones posted elsewhere didn't work for me.  I know you didn't want to specifically do that, but it can be modified to keep more backups (see below).  Please not that this does not apply to deleting specific folders or files from backups.  This script assumes that you have it on a local hard disk (an external disk, most likely).  I had to write my own because the backups are not associated with this computer, so tmutil listbackups doesn't work, and that's what other scripts depended on.\nIn the scripts below, replace DISKNAME with the name of the hard disk with the Time Machine backups and COMPUTERNAME with the name of the computer that the backups belong to.\nFirst, run this script to see a list of the backups the script will delete:\nwhile read line; do\n    echo \"/Volumes/DISKNAME/Backups.backupdb/COMPUTERNAME/${line}\"\ndone < <(ls /Volumes/DISKNAME/Backups.backupdb/COMPUTERNAME | tail -r | tail -n +3)\n\nThe +3 will make leave the last backup.  If you want to keep the last two backups, make it +4.  To keep the last three backups, +5, and so on.\nTo delete all of the backups except the latest, run this script:\nwhile read line; do\n    sudo tmutil delete \"/Volumes/DISKNAME/Backups.backupdb/COMPUTERNAME/${line}\"\ndone < <(ls /Volumes/DISKNAME/Backups.backupdb/COMPUTERNAME | tail -r | tail -n +3)\n\nI know it could be made fancier by defining variables and stuff, but to be honest, I'm not that well-versed in shell scripts. I just know the other super-complicated ones didn't work, but this one did for me, so here it is for posterity.\n\nA: I've written a shell script that lets you optionally specify the number of days to keep: all the backups older than the specified number of days (from now) are deleted.\nYou can check it out on its GitHub repository.\n\nA: What's wrong with Entering Time Machine, browsing to the oldest backup of the entire drive, right clicking, and selecting Delete Folder. Works for me.\n\nA: Run this single command in Terminal to delete all Time Machine backups except for the latest:\nfind $(tmutil machinedirectory) -name \"2*\" -maxdepth 1 \\\n    | sort -r | tail -n +2 | sed 's/.*/\"&\"/' \\\n    | sudo xargs tmutil delete\n\nYou may need to add the Terminal app to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab > Full Disk Access.\n\nA: You can simply enter Time Machine and select folders, apps, and files and select to delete all backup copies of that item. The command line tmutil compare also gives exhaustive detail of what changed between backup intervals if you don't mind using the terminal and a UNIX shell. Even without shell tools, you can micromanage storage from the Time Machine GUI as follows - quoting Apple's article on Mac Basics: Time Machine:\n\nYou can also enter the Time Machine restore interface and find files that can be removed from the backup drive itself to conserve space. To do this, select the file(s) and from the Action pop-up menu (gear icon) in the Time Machine Finder window choose \"Delete All Backups of...\". Be sure to only delete files you are sure you won't need or want to restore later.\n\nNext, you can use a tool like BackupLoupe to analyze your Time Machine backups to identify how much space each interval used, how much space your average backup takes, how long it will be to fill the drive at the current rate, etc…\n\nWith that level of detail, you can curate your storage needs as little or with as much detail as the situation requires. This tool has helped me figure out problematic backup drives, Macs with filesystem corruption (when each backup is larger than it should, etc…) Once you have visibility on what's being stored, you can delete folders, entire snapshots and configure your backup exclusion lists to be in harmony with your available storage and backup needs.\n\nA: Disk Inventory X app really helped me on detecting big files on backup disk. After that, i just removed big files manually.\n\nA: You can list all your backups using the following command:\ntmutil listbackups\n\nThe you delete some some backups from the list e.g.:\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ Backups/Backups.backupdb/yourmachine/date\n\nIt will report the size of each backup deleted and total if deleting more than one at a time. Once you have deleted sufficient backups you may find that the actual backup image file on your backupdrive has not shrunk in size, in which case you need to perform the following step e.g.:\nhdiutil compact /Volumes/yourbackupdrive/yourmachine.sparsebundle\n\nIf this command fails it may be because your machine is not plugged into the power or you may need to mount the backup image file (just double click on it in the Finder) and eject it again before attempting the compact command.\n", "Q: How to share .bashrc files between two mac user accounts I have set up two user logins on my computer, one for home and one for work. I would like to be able to share any of my bash and vim settings between the two users. Is there anyway to do this? Thus far, I've been copying them from one account to another, but I'd like to be able to just have one file between the two so I can make changes in only one place. Is this even possible? Thanks.\n\nA: You could edit the system-wide .bashrc, which is located in /etc/bashrc.\nIf you are a bit familiar with Git however, you should consider creating a repository for your \"dotfiles\". You can use a free Github repository to do so. Tracking your dotfiles in such a way has many advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can fork or pull from one of the many public dotfiles repositories available, or draw inspiration from them\n\n*You can easily install and update the dotfiles across different user accounts and even different machines\n\n*You get revision control, which might save you from some troubles in the long run\n\n\nA: As others have noted, you can do this with a symlink, but it's also important to appropriately change the permissions so that both users can access and edit the file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove any existing .bashrc for user2:\nrm /Users/user2/.bashrc\n\n\n*Symlink user1's .bashrc to user2's user directory:\nln -s /Users/user1/.bashrc /Users/user2/.bashrc\n\n\n*Change permissions so that both users can modify the file:\nchmod +a \"user2 allow read,write,execute\" /Users/user2/.bashrc\n\n\nA: You can use the ln tool to create a symbolic link:\nln -s /Users/user1/.bashrc /Users/user2/.bashrc\n\nIn this example you are creating a new link for user2 pointing back to the existing file in user1's directory. You may need to use sudo ln ... if the permissions are not set correctly.\n\nA: There are many ways to accomplish this, but the common idiom I've seen is to install a single file outside each user's home folder and have both ~/.bashrc files source in the common file. \nThis allows clarity, potential to make user-level changes at a later date, but also only maintain one file that will survive whether or not one or both users are deleted at a later date.\nIt's a little more work than hard linking the file and my experience in using soft links for this sort of thing is to avoid them since some tools don't handle soft (or sym) links as well as you might hope.\nIt's also far easier than using code control to deploy files, but that's also a great way to manage change if you are going to be setting up git or mercurial or another version control system anyhow.\n\nA: Let one be a symbolic link to the other. \nIn terminal.app as user2 use\ncd $HOME; ln -s ../user1/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: Controlling iOS apps via command line I have jailbroken iPad (iOS5.1.1) with the shell utility installed.\nI'd like to be able to launch and control applications via the command line, as I would normally do in Unix or Linux.

(Something similar to cvlc, I couldn't find cvlc for the iPad)\nIs it possible to do so? If yes then how?\n\nA: You can install OpenSSH in Cydia and use a SSH client (say, Panic's Prompt - look for it in the App Store), that makes a pretty nice terminal emulator for iOS.\nAs to running programs from the command line, sure, no problem, but none of them are designed to work in CLI.

Where and how can I change to achieve the above behaviour? \nThanks in advance,\nDan\n\nA: You can create custom key bindings that will apply in most OS X text editors (specifically, those that use the Cocoa framework).\nCheck out KeyBindingsEditor, which provides a front end to the key bindings system.\nAlternatively, you can create a DefaultKeyBinding.dict plist file in ~/Library/KeyBindings/ that allows you to specify custom keybinding actions. You should read Apple's documentation for the precise actions available.\nIn your case, you'll probably want the moveWordForward: and moveWordBackward: methods, if I'm parsing your question correctly.\n", "Q: Macbook Air logic board upgrade Maybe it is silly question, but is it possible to install logic board from Macbook Air i5/i7 to Macbook 1.1 body? Original Core2Duo with 2Gb of RAM is really slow for programming.\n\nA: I think you're out of luck. From iFixit, here's the logic board from the original MacBook Air:\n\nAnd here's the logic board from a 2012 MacBook Air:\n\nUnlike desktops, which typically use standardized parts, laptops use fairly specialized components, and on top of that, Apple tends to iterate its designs fairly aggressively even within models with similar outwards appearance to achieve better cost or performance (e.g. smaller logic boards means more space for the battery). Because of this, most Apple components beyond hard drives and RAM are only interchangeable with those of the exact same generation.\n\nA: No. \nThe internal space, connectors, hard drive interface, power supply locations and other internal design changes make this exchange a non-starter.\nEven moving a connector 2.0 mm makes a huge difference on a device packed as closely as an Air. The replacement you contemplate is much more radical and would require expensive engineering to retrofit a hybrid device.\nSelling the old Air and buying a new device will be far more cost effective than engineering a new custom hybrid device.\n", "Q: Using the Apple Wireless Keyboard with an iPad with PC/Mac-like keyboard commands I have jailbroken iPad 2 (iOS5.1.1) and an Apple wireless Bluetooth keyboard that I use for typing on the iPad.

And if so how?\n\nA: BeeKeyboard is a tweak available via Cydia that adds the ability to create custom keyboard shortcuts.

Mine is zsh\n\nA: One way to debug command-line pipes is to insert | tee debug.txt between two steps and look at the file debug.txt to check whether the previous steps are correct.\n\nA: Another way to debug pipes is to add each element in sequence until you have a problem. For example, start with\nioreg -lw0 | grep \\\"EDID\\\"\n\nwhich outputs nothing. That means there is no string \"EDID\" output by ioreg. So there's the problem.\nBut hey, I don't like seeing a problem unsolved: let's simplify a little more by getting rid of the quotation marks. I assume your Mac is like mine.\nioreg -lw0 | grep EDID\n\nmatches a string IODisplayEDID. Substituting IODisplayEDID for EDID in the grep argument succeeds.

The Mini is headless and I'm using an iMac to do screen sharing for admin purposes. I'm trying to set up sharing of a particular folder on an external HDD attached to the Mini via USB3, but for some reason I can't share this folder and the problem seems to be related to its name. I would like to know what I can do (other than just renaming the folder) to fix the problem.\nIn more detail: I'm trying to share a folder containing FLAC music files. These files are in a folder called Music/FLAC on the volume Titan, an external HDD attached to the Mini (Saturn). Hence I'm trying to share the folder FLAC.\nThe HDD has been formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). I don't know how to work out whether it is case sensitive or not. In Disk Utility I can run Verify Disk and it says the volume appears to be okay but Verify Disk Permissions is greyed out (because owners are not enabled for external drives?).\nI'm logged in using an administrator account. I go to Sharing in System Preferences. The File Sharing service is checked. In Options, Share files and folders using AFP is checked; SMB is not. I click the + button to add a share, navigate to the FLAC folder, and click Add. The dialog closes, but no share is added. Similarly, if I navigate to the folder using Finder, do Get Info then check the Shared folder checkbox, the change is not persisted when I close the Get Info dialog.\nIf I look in the Console app, I see entries like this:\n\nSystem Preferences[4648]: SFL(4648): AddNewItemWithProperties_rpc\n  returned -36 System Preferences[4648]: LSSharedFileListInsertItemFSRef\n  returned NULL for path:/Volumes/Titan/Music/FLAC\n\nNow here's the really odd part. If I rename the folder to flac (that is, change the case), then the file sharing works fine! Some experimentation with various casing seems to suggest that all lowercase is fine, but any uppercase letter causes the share to fail. The computer is happy to share the MP3 folder located in the Music folder however.\nI'm kind of at a loss to explain this behaviour, but then I don't have much experience with Macs.\nThe only other thing that may have a bearing on this (although I hope not) is that there is also a NAS box on the same Ethernet network that has a public SMB share named flac. I can't see how this would make any difference though.\nUpdate 26 March\n@GrahamPerrin: Your steps 1-4 are basically what I had already done, but I tried again to make sure. No change: flac works ok, FLAC doesn't.\nAs a quick fix, I was going to share the folder as flac, but although it shared, the share appeared as flac-1 on the iMac. Whatever is going on it definitely doesn't like that folder name, regardless of casing. So now I've renamed the folder to FLACs and shared it like that, and it seems happy enough.\n\nA: I'm not sure what to tell you about the actual problem but I can share some insight that might help you track it down.  The iMac connecting to the lower case \"flac\" share but mounting it as \"flac-1\" tells me it's all ready connected to a volume named some form of flac.  It could just be that it's all ready connected to the SMB NAS you mentioned. \nRegardless I've seen an issue where software expects a certain path and instead of throwing an error about not finding the path it just tried to create it which then leaves a sort of null path that you have to manually remove.  If you don't remove it then names like \"flac-1\" start appearing.  Re-reading that it may not make sense but regardless the steps I've used to see what's what are firing up Terminal (found in /Applications/Utilities) and typing:\nls -la /Volumes\n\nIf you see more listed here than you expect or can find through normal finder navigation then you can remove them (Only do this if you're 100% sure it's a path that contains nothing you ever want to see again!) by typing:\nrm -rf /Volumes/NULLPATH\n\nwhere NULLPATH is what you wan to get rid of.\nAlong these lines if the mini is all ready showing a \"FLAC\" or some such in /Volumes then you're not goign to be able to share a folder by the same name.  As in if the mini is connected to the SMB NAS then you're going to have to use a different share name.\nAlso you can turn ownership on, on your external HD by opening the get info window on the drive and checking the box at the bottom of the window to \"Enable Ownership on this volume\".  I'm not sue it will in any way effect your issue but might be something to try.\n\nA: -36\nOn OS X, -36 is an I/O error (historically a bummer). \nIs the file system of the external disk HFS Plus? Case insensitive or sensitive? \nBegin with a verification of file system integrity. \nA change from the working configuration\n\n… rename the folder to flac (that is, change the case), then the file sharing works …\n\nTry: \n\n\n*\n\n*make file sharing work with flac\n\n*from the Sharing pane of System Preferences, remove that folder\n\n*rename from flac to FLAC\n\n*add FLAC to the list of shared folders. \nSpecifically: \n\n\n*\n\n*do not change the name of a folder whilst it is shared. \n\n\nLSSharedFileListInsertItemFSRef returned NULL for path:\nThis string appears in Apple Support Communities: Oh boy, what did 10.6.2 do to my iMac  file sharing? … the question there is unanswered and whilst we can't reply, I do recognise the user from elsewhere.

I have recently set up a server on my Mac mini with the OS X Mountain Lion Server app. I would like to have remote access (from outside of my home's wifi network) to the files and folders in my home folder and shared locations (on the Mac mini), and I understand that to do this I need a VPN connection. I'm not familiar with these kinds of things, and I've been trying to set this up but I can't get it to work. \nIt's worth mentioning that I don't actually have a registered domain name - the host name is server.example.private (I've replaced \"example\" with something else). From any computer connected to my home's wifi network I can access the server's wiki by entering \"192.168.0.(some number)\" into the address box, but I cannot access it by using \"server.example.private\" (even from the wifi network) - this might indicate what the problem is. Furthermore, I can access my home folder and shared locations using Finder from a Macbook Air (I can only do this when connected to my home's wifi network) by connecting to my Mac mini and logging in - I would like to be able to do this remotely.\nI'm probably just doing something really stupid, like not configuring some setting (or perhaps not setting up DNS properly...). Could anyone please explain the steps required to set up VPN (and maybe different aspects relating to/depending upon this)? All the tutorials I've seen so far ask me to register a domain name, and I'm not quite ready to do that yet (I hope that's not the problem). Please let me know if you need any more details.\nThanks.\n\nA: OSX Server does have several VPN servers in it.\nYou can configure these using Server.app however, if your internal name resolution is broken this is likely to be more trouble.\nYou'll also need to make sure your Mac Mini's VPN port is available to the internet on a static IP (or dynamic host name).\nAs an interim step I suggest looking at 'Back To My Mac' which is free as part of iCloud. Technically it uses adhoc ipsec vpn tunnels and gives you an DNS name for each mac set up, effectively bypassing the current internal name resolution issue. e.g. server.12345678.members.btmm.icloud.com\nServices that you run e.g. web and ssh will accessible.\nThey're btmm DNS address are not internet routable and don't, generally, require any port forward or static IP addresses. \nFor a couple more technical details check here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/53776/46039\n\nA: I found the solution! The three problematic factors were as follows, and these may also apply to other people trying to set up VPN for Mac OS X Server:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had to ensure that port forwarding was properly set up, as I didn't really see this as an important thing - once the VPN service was working, I disabled the port forwarding for the various VPN ports (500, 1701 and 4500, I think) and it stopped working.\n\n*I had to use the server's host name on its VPN's config page (server.example.private), BUT I had to use the external/public IP address (like the one you get from whatsmyip.org) on the client's VPN's config page.\n\n*DON'T ENTER THE GROUP NAME ON THE CLIENT'S MACHINE UNLESS YOU REALLY HAVE TO! I entered my group's name, and it didn't work (maybe because I am an administrator as well...)\n\n\nI hope this helped, at least it's working for me now, and please let me know if you need any more help with any problems that occur while setting up VPN!\n", "Q: Can I create an iTunes U course indepedent of an educational institution? I would like to create a course to share on the public iTunes U Catalog, however I do not want the course to be associated with an educational institution. Rather, I just want the course to be available to everyone as an independent instructor. \nHow would I do this in iTunes U?\n\nA: You can inspect the agreements that Apple wishes you to accept as part of the enrollment into iTunes U as an instructor from the web page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://itunesu.itunes.apple.com/coursemanager/\nYou will need to sign in with an Apple ID or make a new Apple ID to access this page. It asks you to define your affiliation with some sort of school - so that might be a problem if you don't have a school that will permit you to represent them. You could of course form a school since the categories look broad (Kindergarten, Elementary, Middle, High School, Undergraduate, Graduate, Professional and/or Vocational) and it's not clear based on where you live what legal requirements are present to form a school.\nThere is a second registration step for each institution to establish a public iTunes U page that also might have more detailed requirements to vet the existence of a formal organization, but the footnote 3 on the main marketing page for iTunes U lists:\n\nTeachers not affiliated with schools that have public iTunes U sites are limited to 12 courses and 50 students per course.\n\nSo, you might either find a school that allows you to begin publishing or consider forming one. The system is clearly designed / worded to prevent just anyone from joining, but I don't know how strict Apple would be in approving an application. I'd say you wouldn't want to waste your time making a fictitious school or being dishonest on the application, but if you were unaffiliated, you might list that and see how the application process goes.\n", "Q: OS X renames secondary volume on boot I have a second internal drive (in the optical bay), named \"Secondary\". It is mounted in /Volumes/Secondary. User directory is moved to that drive and also symlinked.\nSometimes when I reboot, and always during a crash, OS X creates an empty directory under /Volumes/Secondary and basically creates a new user profile. Then it moves the actual drive to /Volumes/Secondary 2.\nI have to go in and manually delete the new dir, move the other one and reboot again.\nHow can I lock in that volume name permanently?\n\nA: The ghost mount is probably due to an application or some aspect of the system attempting to check something after the external drive is unmounted during the shutdown process (or crash). In this case, a directory (and even subfiles) may be created.\nYou can get rid of this directory by simply removing it as a script. The trick is to get the script to run when the new volume is mounted. There's probably a way to do this with autofs, but I'm not so familiar with its intricacies. I would instead recommend using Lingon to automatically run the script in response to the mount request.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 needs to restored, but I am concerned about losing photos My iPhone 4 suddenly turned off and won't turn back on.

I see the TimeMachine has an option to not back up when on battery power, but it is possible that the laptop is plugged in to power, but not to wired ethernet.\n\nA: I use this: https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/26341/timemachinescheduler\nSolved all of my TM and corrupt sparse bundle issues (backing up to a Synology NAS)\n\nA: ControlPlane includes an action: \n\n\n*\n\n*Toggle Time Machine\n\n", "Q: Screencast Video Stream Our school radio station is currently supplementing the audio based lessons with a slideshare meeting-based slideshow. Unfortunately slideshare has been pretty buggy and any time we want to stream video (say off youtube) the video fails because of the traffic generated by 20 devices loading the same video stream at the same time. \nWe could mitigate this if we could stream a screencast live on the local network - we could literally stream a keynote presentation off the radio mac's screen and any video content straight from the browser. We don't need to worry about bandwidth internally - it's our external internet connection that causes our lag problems. \nI've tried QT Streaming Server but it's not so well supported and I can't stream a screencast, only a webcam video stream. \nIs there an easy way to stream a live mac screencast locally to more than one mac client? \n\nA: To live stream your desktop, you will want to get two pieces of software:\nSoftware to capture your desktop as a stream and redirect:\n1) CamTwist - http://camtwiststudio.com/download/ - does desktop live capture and turns it into a video stream that is compatible for \"webcam\" input applications. I've used this to live stream my desktop to ustream.tv, Google Hangout, etc. (free)\nAND\n2) SoundFlower - https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/ - Allows you to redirect the system sound output so that it can be routed as an input for your stream (free)\nSoftware to publish from your desktop:\n1) EvoCam - http://www.evological.com/evocam.html - does a local http streaming server to serve your \"webcam\" stream out to the local area network. ( $30 )\nOR\n2) VLC - http://www.videolan.org/vlc/streaming.html - VideoLAN streaming component of VLC to livestream your \"webcam\" produced from your camtwist/soundflower combo.  (free)\nCan post more details, if this solution path works for you.\nEdit: Note, a few test runs of VLC to export a stream crashes on my Mac. Looks like recent VLC builds support streaming the desktop, which is cool. With soundflower, you can also redirect the system output as well as the mic so that output from the apps and programs are livestreamed as well... provided your copy of VLC is running stably. :)\nEDIT:\nCamTwist is 32bit. So you will need to download the 32bit version of VLC for Mac OS X:\nhttp://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.0.6/macosx/vlc-2.0.6-intel32.dmg\n\n\n*\n\n*Fire up CamTwist\n\n*Select Desktop (not Desktop+) by double clicking it. This will add it to the list.\n\n*Select \"Save Setup\", and give it a name. \n\n*Go to [tools]->[Studio], which will pop up a new window showing a list of \"sources\", a preview pane, and a program pane. Your new stream probably shows up in \"Program\", which is the \"live webcam\" indicator. You can select another source via the buttons and it will show up in the \"green preview\" window. Hitting \"cut\" will cut over from preview to program.\n\n*Fire up your 32bit VLC\n\n*[file]->[open capture device]\n\n*Under Capture Device, choose CamTwist.\n\n*check the [streaming] radio box\n\n*Choose the streaming settings\n\n*Choose the [stream] radio button\n\n*Leave most of the options as default\n\n*Hit OK\n\n*Hit Open\n\n*This should start the stream.\n\n\nOn my box, my copy of VLC happens to crash at this point, but then again, my version of VLC (2.06 and 2.10) both seem to crash when I try to stream anything. So it might be a problem on my system.\nBut the above is how I get CamTwist setup and VLC to see CamTwist.\n\nA: When I understand correctly you just want to broadcast the Mac's screen. \nMaybe Wirecast would be an option: \nIt allows broadcasting a local or remote screen to the a streaming server, such as QT Streaming Server or any flash based like Wowza, Red5,..\nAdditionally external video sources could be added and mixed at will. \nA free alternative would be Flash Media Live Encoder in combination with CamTwist to capture the screen.\nHere is a tutorial:\nhttp://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2011/05/29/setting-up-desktop-streaming-on-mac-os-x/\n\nA: Consider: \nSeeVogh Research Network\n(You're located in New Zealand. New Zealand Research and Education is a member of the Network.)\nWith SeeVogh you can broadcast at least: \n\n\n*\n\n*a talking head, if you have a camera and microphone\n\n*all or part of one screen. \nThere's a wealth of documentation, much of which relates to EVO (a predecessor to SeeVogh), but the simplest way to realise the features is: \n\n\n*\n\n*register and use the service. \n\n\nHints: \n\n\n*\n\n*SeeVogh is more user-friendly than EVO\n\n*a player for SeeVogh is expected within the next two weeks.\nRequirements\nOn Linux, OS X and Windows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Java (details, including a .jnlp file for a quick check). \n\n\nLocality\nWhilst SeeVogh services are non-local, related technologies such as LISA (Large Integrated Services Architecture) should be well-suited to working around bandwidth and other issues (for the curious, there's a MonALISA GUI). \n\nIf you find that SeeVogh does not work as expected for users on your LAN, I'll be interested to know; leave a comment. \nPostscript: considering the additional information (students aged 5–12), SeeVogh is probably not suitable.

When I click \"Share\" on an iPad photo not in Camera Roll, there's a \"Copy\" option. It seems to do nothing, how can I get it to work? Ideally I want to copy a photo to the Camera Roll so I can save it to my computer. It's annoying that I can't just save all the photos, Camera Roll or not, from the iPad to my computer.\n\nA: The Copy function copies the photo onto the clipboard. You can then paste it into other apps, say Mail, by tapping and holding until a contextual menu appears that says \"Paste\". If you're on a web page, you can tap and hold an image and select \"Save Image\" to save it to your camera roll. But you can't use the Copy function to \"paste\" it into your camera roll.\n\nA: When you click copy it saves in your photo stream then you can save from there\n\nA: As a possible solution, I've found that if I want to duplicate or copy a photo in the Camera Roll section, the only way to do it is to send it in an email to myself and then download the photo again. That way you can make as many copies of it as you need. \n", "Q: Quick search in folder by key press I switched from PC to Mac, in pc when you're in explorer, you press a key and it highlights the first result of a file/folder that starts with the pressed key,  and when you press again  it goes to the next result\nIn mac, when i press a key in finder or anywhere contains files, it only shows the first result and ignores my repeated key presses that is supposed to move to the next result highlight\nhow to do this ?\n\nA: The way it works in OS X's Finder is you can type a word and the selection will move down as filenames are matched.\nThe quickest way to move between files, if you aren't in column view, when typing only the first letter, is following up with tab\n", "Q: How to move iMovie library to external hard drive folder? I would like to move all iMovie (iMove '11) events to a specific folder of an external hard drive. Apple documents a means to do this, but without specifying the folder; iMovie files are created in the root of the mounted drive, in a folder called iMovie Events.localized.\nThat's great, except my wife would like to do the same thing on the same hard drive. Since we want to keep our media libraries separate, having everything dumped in the same folder would be problematic. I could move everything manually, of course, though warnings abound that iMovie data should be moved only from within iMovie itself. Is there any way to tell iMovie to use a specific folder when moving the iMovie data for projects/events to an external drive?\nNote: I tried to mount the appropriate user directory of the external drive as a separate volume using bindfs without success.\n[Edit: As per a suggestion in the accepted answer, I am creating a disk image for each iMovie library. Please see the comments in the accepted answer for further details.]\n\nA: Since iMovie doesn't have a setting to set a folder inside the drive and stores things at the root of an external drive, you can use folders to segregate projects quite nicely.\n\nWhen you open iMovie, just right click on the name of the external drive and make a new folder. Make a second folder and name them for each of you. When you open iMovie, you can collapse her folder and vice versa to avoid having to see all of the projects for the non-active user.\nYou could also make disk images on the drive and store them anywhere, but that is a bit more tedious for little additional payoff. You would avoid having two folders made at the root of the drive, but at the expense of a more complicated storage layer. The down side is you still have folders at the root of the external drive as well as all the project footage is in subfolders rather than in their own folder.\nThe remedy for this is to create sparse disk images for each set of projects and mount them before moving content to each \"disk\". The iMovie visual will be as if you have two drives additional drives even though they are just files/folders on the same drive.\n\nThe only warning I have is when you have multiple clips referencing the same footage - avoid moving one and not the other. Moving all the projects to the external would be extremely robust and workable, but iMovie can be a little too aggressive in moving footage to a new drive without checking to see if other projects left behind reference that footage. Luckily, things re-link nicely once you discover the missing footage error and reunite the \"left behind\" project with it's partner and footage.\n", "Q: autossh not behaving as expected I am trying to use autossh, like so:\nautossh -f -i id_rsa -D 8080 user@myserver.com\n\nHowever, on both an PPC Tiger eMac and a Mountain Lion MacBook Pro, I just get presented with the argument and environment variable list.\nBoth machines have autossh 1.4c installed. I am focused on getting it working on the Tiger machine; I only tried it on my Mountain Lion MBP to see if the issue was Tiger-specific.\n\nA: I ran into this before and the issue for me was autossh expects a specified monitoring port (even though this is optional according to the usage stdout).\nautossh -M 12345 -f -i id_rsa -D 8080 user@myserver.com\n\nThis similar command works for me against autossh 1.4c installed via homebrew on mountain lion.\n", "Q: Making A USB Drive Bootable in Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion I own copies of all three operating systems and would like to have a single drive that enable me to boot from and use Disk Warrior etc under each OS. Is this possible?\n\nA: Use Disk Utility to partition your external drive into three volumes. This kbase article can help you (use instructions for a startup disk). Name the volumes something that will help you identify them when you option-boot into them later (something like \"Tech 10.6\", \"Tech 10.7\", \"Tech 10.8\"). I recommend at least 8-16GB for each partition to allow the OS to install and room for additional software.\nThen follow your normal procedure for creating your bootable Disk Warrior environment. If you are installing OS X 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 respectively onto each volume, just use the typical OS X installation instructions specific to each OS. Ensure that you are on a Mac capable of installing each OS and ensure you select the correct volume from the external drive.\nWhen all is said and done you will be able to option-boot into each environment as long as the machine hardware/firmware is capable of booting into the respective OS you select.\n", "Q: Selectively force Siri to send SMS instead of iMessage I carry an iPhone.  On occasion, I will use Siri to send a quick text message to a person, e.g. \"Text Alice I'm on my way.\"\nMy problem is that Alice has a non-Apple phone and an iPad, and I've used both SMS to communicate with her phone and iMessage to communicate with her on her iPad.  If I'm using the Messages app directly, I can pick either the SMS conversation or the iMessage conversation, but if I say \"Text Alice,\" it seems unpredictable which mode of communication Siri will select.\nAnnoyingly, even if I say \"SMS Alice,\" Siri can choose iMessage.  Is there any way to specify which mode I wish to use?\n\nA: For SMS, tell Siri \"Text Alice on mobile I'll be right there.\"\nAlternatively, you can set up two different contacts for Alice, one for SMS and one for iMessage and then tell Siri which one to use be citing the different names.\n", "Q: Firewall settings with \"imagent\" Among others that I recognize, I have the \"imagent\" been allowed to pass true my firewall (allow incoming connection). \nWhat/who is it, and do I must have it or can I just block it.\nI do not remember allowing it in the first place anyway, but that could be due to my age :)\n\n\nA: IMAgent is a process that listens for FaceTime/iMessage invitations. It will be active even if FaceTime isn't running. You don't have to block it, but if you don't use FaceTime you can open the application, open preferences, and turn off FaceTime. That should quit the IMAgent process.\n\nA: imagent is part of iMessage/Messages/Facetime (see e.g. here) and needs to accept incoming connections for the same reasons as Skype and GoogleTalk do. \n\nA: The top-voted answer should be changed since IMAgent can be used for non-FaceTime messaging purposes. For example, it will connect to your Jabber account if you added one in Messages.\n\nA: It's part of the iMessage system. It's needed when sending messages / pictures.\n\nA: if it's using too much cpu, feel free to kill.

Using the \"Print > Save as PDF\" feature leads to a file of the (approximate) same size, i.e. also much too big.\nThis happens for this file, most others are okay when exported to PDF. Are there settings that could help reduce the file of the PDF file generated?\n\nA: Courtesy of the ever-useful Dr. Drang, you can try using a Quartz Filter to downsample the images to reduce the file size, often without any apparent reduction in quality.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ColorSync Utility and click on the Filters tab.\n\n*Add a new filter, give it a name you like.\n\n*Click on the grey arrow, select Color Image Sampling under Add Image Effects Component.\n\n*Enter 150 in the resolution box.\n\n\nNow we need to create an Automator service to apply the filter to the PDF file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and make a new Service.\n\n*Change the top drop-down to PDF Files.\n\n*Add the Apply Quartz Filter to PDF Documents action, and select the filter you just created in the drop-down.\n\n*Save it with a name of your choice.\n\n\nNow you should be able to right click on a PDF file, and you should see the service you created near the bottom of the menu.

I can't seem to find a way to do anything other than add subscriptions, folders and delete subscriptions. Is there any way I can just rename my existing subscriptions?\n\nA: It is not possible to manage the feeds inside Reeder.app. Nevertheless it will synchronize all changes made to feeds within Google Reader. So if you want to rename a feed, open the webpage of Google Reader and go to the preferences.\n\nIn the prefs, choose the Abonnements tab (at least this is the German headline) and rename the feed.\n\nIf you now head back to the Reeder.app and synchronize your feeds the changes will be reflected and the feed will be renamed.\nPlease remember that this workaround will only work until July 1, because Google is shutting down the Reader service.\n\nA: It isn't possible to edit subscriptions on Reeder. You will need to login to your RSS, or news feed account to edit subscriptions. \nPlease go ahead and contact their support to request the ability to do that. \n\nA: You can now (on iPhone Reeder app) rename individual subscriptions by long-pressing on them in the folder view. For some reason, clicking on the feed and going into the three-dot settings menu gives you lots of ways to customize the display of the subscription but not rename it.\n", "Q: How to selectively force Siri to send iMessage instead of SMS? In this question, I asked how to have Siri specifically send an SMS message to a person who does not have an SMS-capable iOS device registered with Apple, but does have iMessage on e.g. an iPad.\nThe answer was to say e.g. \"Text Alice on mobile I'll be there soon,\" since \"Text Alice\" or even \"SMS Alice\" would not force Siri to use any specific mechanism.\nHowever, we could not discover what magic word one could use in place of \"mobile\" to force the opposite effect: sending an iMessage instead of an SMS.  Words I've tried include:\n\n\n*\n\n*email\n\n*iMessage\n\n*iOS\n\n*iPad\n\n\nAll of the above result in a message containing the magic word, e.g. \"Text Alice on iMessage I'll be there soon\" results simply in a message reading \"On iMessage I'll be there soon.\"\nDoes anyone know what the magic word is for iMessage, if there is one?  Such a magic word would allow me to use Siri to send my choice of an SMS or an iMessage to Alice, since Alice carries both a non-Apple mobile phone and an iPad, though she does not necessarily have both on her or online at any given time.\n\nA: I believe that the siri command for imessage is: Message Alice i'll be there soon. This will not prevent it from sending a text message. To prevent it from sending a text message, go into settings --> messages --> and turn off the \"Send as SMS\" switch.\nIn her contact it should look like this:\n\nAlice Appleseed\nPhone: (XXX) XXX-XXXX\nEmail: aliceappleseed@xxxxxxx.net\n\nWhat you need to do is try to message her on one of these accounts.\nTry saying: \"message alice on her email...I'll see you later\"\nThen: \"message alice on her mobile...I'll see you later\"\nThe point is: you want to state where you want to send the message. If you just say \"message Alice\", then siri will ask you where you want the message to go.\nSince the iPad doesn't have a phone number, you message it through its email address (this will have to send an iMessage). The non-iPhone uses its phone number (this will have to send a text message).\nI hope this helps.\n\nUpdate: Brought to my attention by the author of the original question, the method above: \"message alice on her email...I'll see you later\" is not fully effective.\nRather, saying it this way:\n\n\"message alice on iCloud...I'll see you later\"\n\nwill send the imessage to Alice's iCloud email address (which must be set up by her as an E-mail address which can contact her via imessage). Note: If I'm correct, the E-mail account used as a contact point does not have to be an iCloud account (although it may be better to use one anyway). For instance, you could use the E-mail account of johnny.appleseed@example.com, yet label it as an iCloud account in Contacts, and it SHOULD work the same.\nSadly, I have since stopped using Siri, simply because I have been too busy, so feel free to correct me if I am wrong about this all.\nGlad I could help. (surprised that you remembered my answer, since it was written a good while ago.)\n\nA: Get the person to unregister their phone number from iMessage, then the message Alice on mobile request will be semantically valid and will use SMS to their phone.\nThere is a web page for unregistering phone numbers without an iOS device, but since they have an iPad they should be able to go into their settings and uncheck the phone number.\nUnder Settings -> Messages -> Send & Receive:\n\nSince the device is an iPad, not an iPhone unlike my screenshot, their phone number should be able to be disabled.\n\nA: Go to Settings → Messages, then disable Send as SMS and disable MMS Messaging.\nThat way you're forcing Siri to use iMessage.\n\nA: You can send an iMessage to an Apple ID, but the recipient must be logged in to that ID on the receiving device.  \nYou can also send it to a phone number IF that phone number is associated with an Apple ID and you are logged in.  In this case, an Apple server maps the number to the Apple ID and sends the iMessage there.\n", "Q: I can't install OSX Lion from DVD, because I receive an error I tried to install OSX Lion from DVD, but when I boot from the dvd I receive bootstrapper crashed error.

Here is my problem and tell me how your software or other can help me.\n\nA: Put a switch which can have ports configured in \"span\" mode so you can sniff all the traffic, (an old hub will also do the same job) between the router and the base station.\nPlug in your laptop, install wireshark and sniff all the traffic.  Then analyse.\nThe other tool I use is MRTG, but you will need to set up SNMP on the Airport or the \"spanned\" switch, and monitor for a few days.\nYou can definitely use SNMP with an Airport extreme as documented here.\n\nA: For router traffic I use NetUse Traffic Monitor. If I identify a problem computer, I will start with Little Snitch on the computer.\n\nA: I think that Proxifier can be useful for this case. You need create the correct filter for your connection and see the statistics of the traffic network.\n\nA: Just span and capture with tcpdump and then analyze the traffic with Wireshark (tshark) for top talkers, one or two hosts will jump out immediately...\nIf you sniff the packets realtime you can almost always tell the top talkers they're the packets you see most often, usually it take me about 1min. to find the culprit.\n", "Q: Configure a network with an AirPort Extreme and Mac Mini Server?

Whenever I ask friends, colleagues and acquaintances why they have bought an Apple Mac and switched from Windows, nine times out of ten the response I receive is:\n\"Macs don't get viruses\"\nIs it true that not one single virus has been identified on Macs ?\nIs it also true that the majority of malware identified is in the form of trojans, of which the most famous one I recall was the Flashback trojan which created havoc this time last year (if I'm not mistaken) and was identified by the Russian company Dr.Web, which quickly brought out a removal tool, which was then followed by other Internet Security Companies who jumped on the bandwagon to say:\n\"See Macs do get Viruses\"\nIs the underlying reason that malware is supposedly less is because Windows still dominates in usage terms for most people, but eventually in a few more years, there will be just as much malware on a Mac as on a Windows PC ?\n\nA: To answer your main question: malware is less common on Macs than Windows systems simply because people haven't written as much malware for Macs.\nAny debates about which operating system is \"more secure\" than another one are not very meaningful. Neither OS X or Windows will ever be 100% free from security flaws, so there will always be potential vectors for malware -- not to mention trojans and social engineering. You need only look at the system updates to see that Apple is constantly patching security flaws in Mac OS X, just like everyone else.\nIf you were a malware author and wanted to get your malware onto as many systems as possible, wouldn't you target the OS with the largest user base? This is most likely why malware is much more common on Windows; so many more people have scrutinized it, looking for exploits.\n\nIs it true that not one single virus has been identified on Macs?\n\nAssuming you mean \"malware\" in general, no, that's not true. In recent memory, the Flashback malware has been delivered by both a trojan installer (which tricks the user into giving it permission) and an exploit in Java (which doesn't require any user action).\n\nIs it also true that the majority of malware identified is in the form of trojans\n\nI can't find any reliable data, but there have definitely been several trojans targeting Mac users in recent years.\n\nIs the underlying reason that malware is supposedly less is because Windows still dominates in usage terms for most people, but eventually in a few more years, there will be just as much malware on a Mac as on a Windows PC ?\n\nIt's hard to say for sure, obviously, because nobody can predict the future. Apple is obviously taking steps to try to keep Mac users as safe as possible (e.g., Gatekeeper), but again, OS X will never be 100% immune to security threats. It's just a fact.\n\nA: Ask Windows users why Macs don't get viruses and they usually say it's because Macs don't have the market share, ask Mac users the same question and they'll say it's because the Mac is less susceptible to them. I'm a long term Mac user and fall into the second camp. OSX is built on UNIX and UNIX is designed from the bottom up to be a secure OS and security has been a high priority on UNIX for decades as it is used to handle very sensitive government, corporate and military data. Macs do have weaknesses because they are used by non-technical people in unsecure locations. Mostly Macs are at risk from Trojans but one would also need to beware of Java, Flash and other 3rd party apps that have access to the internals of OSX. Use decent passwords, keep your machine from those you don't trust, don't visit dubious websites and certainly don't open or install anything from sites you don't trust and all should be well. Like anything in life, we don't know what tomorrow will bring.\n", "Q: I need to hide `Show all bookmarks` button in Safari 6 I use Safari 6 (on OS X 10.8.3) and I want to hide all button on Bookmarks Bar in Safari 6.\nFor Show Reading list and Show Top Sites there are an options to hide it in Preference → Bookmark but there is no option for hide Show all bookmarks button.\nIs there anyway to hide Show all bookmarks button on Bookmark Bar in Safari 6 ? I don't want to see it on my browser anymore.\n\nA: Safari lets you hide the entire bookmark bar, but not customize that one item.\nThe other items that show up to the left of all your bookmarks are in a fixed order and you can turn them all off except for the show all bookmarks icon.\n\nUnless someone finds a hidden preference to write by hand into the safari defaults preferences, you may have to request this as a bug or enhancement request to Apple for Safari.\nAt best, you're stuck with the space that the back arrow takes on the left of the bookmark bar if you turn off all the other default items.\n\n", "Q: Selling macbook, best/fastest way to delete data? I need help to erase all of my data from my computer...\nSelling 2009 Macbook pro w. Lion.\nI don't have the startup disks.\nSo I've created another admin account and am trying to delete mine from there.\nBut of course, it has been saying \"deleting account\" for hours.\nFaster suggestions?\n\nA: If someone else has an SSD, the secure erase options are currently disabled for SSDs in Disk Utility. According to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3680 erasing an SSD normally might be secure enough:\n\nNote: With OS X Lion and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault 2 encryption when you start using the SSD drive.\n\nYou can still run something like diskutil secureErase 4 disk0s2 in Terminal on the recovery partition. Simply enabling FileVault before erasing the drive or volume is probably a better option though. See this question.\n\nA: I'll take a crack at \"fastest\":\n(Note: This should go without saying, but make sure you read through this and understand it before you do anything.)\nAssuming your original admin account was \"joe\" whose home was \"/Users/joe\"\n1.

Find Other Files\nThen you might want to take a look for other files owned by joe. You can do this by username or user ID. I recommend ID, but that's probably because I'm an overly cautious fuddyduddy.\nsudo find / -user 501 -print\n\nreplace '501' with whatever the number was above is Step #1\n\nA: I don't know if I can necessarily help you out with the \"fastest\" way, but I think I can help with \"best\".\nMost of your data will indeed be in your account, but there's also the chance that other personal items may be scattered about your hard drive.  I would not personally sell a computer after just removing my own account, particularly if my account was not securely deleted, either by overwriting the unused disk space or by discarding the encryption key.  (Of course, there's always the chance a computer could be lost or stolen, too, so I use FileVault 2 to encrypt my system's disk in case I'm not given the opportunity to securely erase it.)\nYou say you don't have a startup disk, but since you have Lion, you should be able to use OS X Recovery:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold command-R on startup.\n\n*Use Disk Utility to erase the disk securely using Security Options on the Erase tab.\n\n*Start the installer to install a fresh copy of Lion.  (This may involve downloading the installer from the Internet… note this can be a very large download.  If you're feeling nice, you could take this opportunity to grab a copy of the installer for your MacBook's new owner.)\n\nA: The quickest way to delete everything is to boot to the Recovery HD and terminal to drop a new empty filesystem on top of the existing one:\n diskutil reformat disk0s2\n\nYou might check that the device is correct by issuing diskutil list and making sure that Macintosh HD is actually disk0s2, but most people that have an alternate device layout know they do and can compensate. Note, this doesn't erase anything in terms of leaving all the files sitting on the drive. You would then want to consider if you wanted to zero the empty blocks, or do some more lengthy secure erases.\n diskutil secureErase 0 disk0s2 \n\nThe above command would zero out the entire volume and you can choose other levels such as:\n\n            Level should be one of the following:\n                  +   0 - Single-pass zero-fill erase.\n                  +   1 - Single-pass random-fill erase.\n                  +   2 - US DoD 7-pass secure erase.\n                  +   3 - Gutmann algorithm 35-pass secure erase.\n                  +   4 - US DoE algorithm 3-pass secure erase.\n\n\nAs mentioned in this other excellent answer, turning on FileVault is far more secure than any of these erase options for SSD and probably for HDD as well.\n\nA: The best way to guarantee that all your personal data is removed is to write-zero the drive and then reinstall the OS, which requires the install discs.\nAs for the iTunes stuff, you'll want to make sure you have a backup of your iTunes library before you actually remove it.

I got it from my former company, and they didn't keep the OS install disc, in fact they wiped it and put Windows 7 on it. I have quite a few macs, and have always used an external USB disc and can install but this machine is so fickle and throws up the multilingual failure message upon boot. I was, however, able to boot into a recovery volume that was on my external hard drive, and I burned Snow Leopard to the machine's OWN hard drive, and when it booted up, it failed again.\nDoes anyone ahve any experience or ideas on how to install Mac OS X on it? It now, has no operating system for me to boot into, though.\n\nA: Finally, issue was solved. I burned my recovery partition from my Mountain Lion Macbook Pro onto a USB drive, and used that to boot into recovery and downloaded and installed Mountain Lion on my Mac Air, successfully.\nIt seems that this generation of Mac Airs have some kind of protection that will ONLY let you use a recovery drive to boot from USB and even from the drive itself.\n\nA: That model of MacBook Air had custom builds for both OS X 10.6.4 and 10.6.5. Your best bet would be to use a USB installation drive made from a later version, i.e. 10.6.8 or any version of Lion or Mountain Lion.\nYou should be able to make a USB installer in the standard way, using Disk Utility to copy the DVD (for Snow Leopard) or InstallESD.dmg (for Lion/Mountain Lion) to a USB drive.\nIf that still doesn't work, then you should try running the Apple Hardware Test, as it's likely a problem beyond the OS installer.\n", "Q: Xcode is hidden in OS X 10.8.2 Now I am using OS X 10.8.2.

My provided upload speed is around 600KB, then there is problem with this.\nI thought of checking if any other app is using my upload internet bandwith. Am I in the right way...?\nWhat do you think, what else can I do?\nAt first I thought it was a problem related to the app Arq, then I posted this problem in its forum: post, but as you can see the developer of this app says that there is no problem with the app at all. \n\nA: Is it 600KBps (600 kilobyte per second) or 600Kbps (600 kilobit per second)? For the latter it would take 5 days to upload 30GB with optimum upload speed. You say it took 10 days. I would say that is reasonable. You can use the System Monitor app to monitor network traffic. It doesn't make clear what app is using the network, but it does make clear if upload is only half of what you would expect. \n\nA: You can use the Activity Monitor program included by default with Mac OS X.

I wonder whether I can do so without performing extra steps on my iPhone?\nI think when I managed to change from one carrier to another previously, it indicated the phone was unlocked, at least among local carrier, but I am unsure whether this phone will remain unlocked when I travel overseas? Or is there a possibility that although you can change local carrier, but for you to change to an oversea carrier you would need to do some other steps? \n\nA: SIM Unlocked means SIM unlocked. There is no lock, so you're free to go.\n\nA: if you where able to use another carrier locally or not, with a different SIM card, you are basically good to go, however if you didn't change your simcard, and simply used another carriers antennas, it proves nothing! so you need to test your iPhone with a new simcard, from a different carrier, different data plans doesn't matter!\nsecond depending on the country you are traveling too you need to check to see if your phone can handle the different bandwidths that are used around the world, if you want me to help you, you need to tell me your phone model, and the country witch you are traveling too!\nand you said you bought the phone 2 years ago, most likely you will be able to call your carrier and have them unlock it for you, perhaps for a small fee!\n", "Q: iPod no wireless networks problem My daughter has an iPod Touch 4th generation I think it is with iOS 6.

It seems iTunes can't erase anything on my iPad!\nHow do I make iTunes capable of deleting from my iPad? And is it possible that iCloud / iTunes are somehow clashing with one another here?\nSince updating to v11 of iTunes, iTunes seems incapable of erasing anything from my iPad.  Every time I sync I am told that there's not enough room; needing on the order of 7-10GB of space to complete the sync.\nThrough iTunes I have disabled all sync types (Movies, Music, Podcasts, iTunes U) ... The only thing active is Apps and according to the size meter at the bottom of the iTunes, I should end up with 20GB of space free.\nI apply my changes and request the sync and after flowing the steps it alerts me it needs 7GB more space on my iPad.\nAdditionally, when I sync photos, I have the same \"can't erase\" type behavior. I initiate the sync, select \"Delete originals from my device after sync\", the sync completes, and sure enough iPhoto continues to tell me that 45 photos remain \"ready to sync\" on the iPad.\nLong time iTunes user... I'm pretty comfortable with the app at this point but this has me stumped.\nThanks in advance.\nVersions:  \niMac 2006 Later  \nOS X: 10.6.8  \niPad: 6.1.3  \niTunes: 11.0.2  \n\n\nA: This is a tricky thing to troubleshoot since once the iTunes tracking database or the iOS tracking database gets corrupt - what should sync and work starts to fail.\nIn the interest of putting out a concrete set of steps, here is how I fix things like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a quick judgment - should I just restore the iOS device and start fresh or are there things on the device I need to back up and save?\n\n*If I need to back things up, now I'm worried my backups might be corrupt too, so run one backup to iCloud and one to iTunes to be paranoid and safe.\n\n*Then I spend 5 minutes deleting things I don't need on the phone (calendars, Mail, contacts that exist in the cloud), game apps that I don't care about losing progress or can re-dowload or sync via iCloud.\n\n*Test the sync again.\n\n*Continue spending 5 minutes paring non-essentials and testing until I'm left with just the really important things on the phone. I then export them or back them up and then erase the iOS device.\n\n\nAgain, it's painful to erase things and start over, but my experience is that this problem is almost always on the iOS device and can be cured by an erase and setting up sync again from scratch.\nYou could try the opposite tack / work from iTunes and stop syncing things one by one until you find the item or class that is causing issues. I've seen that work too, but it seems to fail to cure the underlying problem and I'll be back in iTunes micromanaging the sync settings in a week or a month so I now go for the erase / reinstall option.\nThe benefit of an erase install is that you test your backup and you have the chance to examine the things you care about / ditch the cruft that is on your phone. Rather than being forced to learn if your backup works when you lose a device or break it - you will learn now if restoring works and have chosen the time to test your restore.\nGood Luck - hopefully you don't need to go all the way to erasing and setting up a new phone, but if you do and it fails, you can look squarely at your iTunes to blame for the issue.\n", "Q: Why will Text Edit and other apps prevent me from choosing text colors?

I was trying to use VIM and it kept blinking \"recording\" all the time. Now I know that it means VIM was recording what I was typing. Where does it keep these recordings? I would like to delete these.\n\nA: The \"recording\" label usually appears when you press 'q' key to record a macro. It is not recording what you are typing, it is recording a command sequence to be re-used for later use.\nSee: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Macros\n\nA: The recordings are stored in the named buffers. You can place the buffer contents into a file as text, save the file, and reload the text into a buffer in another session. You can use the same technique to clean up the recorded macro. Insert the buffer as text, edit the text, re-save the text into the same buffer.\n", "Q: Homebrew installed PostgreSQL for use by multiple accounts I'm using Homebrew to install PostgreSQL (PG) on a MacBook Air. \nadmin user brew installed PostgreSQL.\nI'd like another (mobile account) user to be able to use the database for Rails development. admin is owner of /usr/local/ but mobile user is member of a group that has rwx permission. brew doctor is happy and mobile user can successfully brew install\nHow best to set up permissions for this to work?\nfor instance, running initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8 from the admin account created a database for the admin user. And, now it would seem, it wants PG to be launched by that admin user.\nI'd really like either a neutral account to launch PG process or ideally the mobile account to be able to launch and quit an instance of PG as needed.\nPoint being PG doesn't need to be running ALL the time (LaunchDaemon). Ideally, it's a LaunchAgent in mobile user's account. \nThoughts?\n\nA: According to the postgres output, you need to run the postgres server as the same user that creates the database with initdb. \nmr-clean:~ smurf$ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8\nThe files belonging to this database system will be owned by user \"smurf\".\nThis user must also own the server process.\n\nThat means the same user will need to launch the postgres server process. Other users will still be able to launch the client and connect to it, though. So you just need to do the \"admin\" tasks - setup and daemon control - with that owner account.\nIf you want to do everything with the one mobile account, then just run initdb as mobile instead of as admin after doing the brew install postgresql as normal. (It's not who you brew install as that matters, it's who you initdb as.) This'll create the database, and rwx permissions on /usr/local/var (not /usr/local) will be enough to allow this. Then do all your PG work as mobile. The LaunchAgent should work with this approach, though I haven't tested it.\nTo allow multiple users to effectively manage the postgres server (launch and stop the daemon), set it up basically the same way, with a dedicated postgres (or mobile) account that both does the initial initdb and brings the server up or down. Then create a little script to ssh in to localhost as postgres and run the command to bring the server up or down with the same command you'd use in the single-user case. And set up ssh keys so that all the accounts you want to manage PG can ssh in as postgres (that is, cat their public keys to postgres' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file). Now you can effectively have multiple users manage Postgres without deviating from the dedicated-daemon-user model that Postgres expects and fiddling with file permissions and so on.\nThis ssh technique works for any service that needs to be controlled by a dedicated account, and will generalize to the case where you're running your things on different machines.\n", "Q: How can I remove this icon from the menu bar?

It is just using the settings you just set that are associated with the iCloud account. \nThis only works if you don't really use your iCloud account and you only need to reply via one Gmail account.  I had several Gmail accounts, but only respond from one, so this is not a big issue for me.  \n\nA: This is a great question and I hope that it will get a lot of answers.\n(For the sake of this discussion I'll assume by 'push' you mean 'near-instant notification of new messages.' IMAP has something called IMAP IDLE which is similar but I don't think iOS supports it, or maybe Gmail doesn't, or both. Anyway, I don't want that term to become a distraction, I just wanted to make it clear that my working definition of 'push' is \"not waiting for Mail.app to check for new messages every X minutes.\" I'm also not going to get into a debate about whether we \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" be \"tied to our email\" or \"overuse quotation marks.\")\nHere are the solutions that I am aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pay Google: A paid \"Google Apps\" account will allow you to use ActiveSync.\n\n\n*\n\n*Con: I can't find anything to confirm that you can pay for a Gmail account and get ActiveSync back, so you have to change your email address.\n\n*Pro: Should work reliably, does not require any 3rd party services.\n\n\n*AwayFind: A paid AwayFind account (pricing information available here: http://awayfind.com/plans.php) will let you get push notifications for messages which match certain. You could set this up to alert you to all of your messages, but my guess is that once you use the service, you'd realize that you really only want alerts for some messages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro: much better and more granular control over notifications. Works with Gmail or Google Apps (or Exchange, IIRC)\n\n*Con: 3rd-party service (That's not a 'con' for me… AwayFind uses Google OAuth for login, so you're not giving them your password).  I use and recommend their service, but am not otherwise affiliated with them.\n\n\n*Boxcar: You can forward some/all of your email to Boxcar. I used them before AwayFind. They had some reliability issues a few months(?) ago, but I've heard that's gotten much better. Haven't used them for awhile. I think the iOS\n\n*\n\n*Pro: Low cost. App is free with ads, US$5 to remove ads.\n\n*Con: Potential reliability issue, and requires you to forward your email to a 3rd party.\n\n\n\nA: Jailbreak your iOS device if that's an option and let it pull mails more often. 15 minutes may be a long time, but a polling time of one or two minutes might be fine.\nThis will not give you full push mail, but will be fine for most use cases. Mail isn't for instant messaging, anyway. You might trade some battery time and data transfer for the increased pull time, but when I used a poll time of one minute I didn't notice any substantial loss.\n\nA: Mailbox App, By Orchestra, Inc (c)., free at iTunes. Supports push for Gmail. Use Mailbox App for the notification Part and Apple (c) Mail client for processing (reading, forwarding, etc).\n\nA: When I got the iPhone 5S, I was quite surprised that I couldn't instantly receive my gmail.  I have figured a quick alternative that works for me.  I downloaded the google app, set it up, and it is hidden on a different page of my phone.  When I get an email, I immediately get notification through the app.  It even shows up on the locked screen.  Now when I open the phone, I check my iPhone app and it loads the mail.  From there I can read, reply or archive (you can't delete anymore).  That does however, clear out the mails from the app so I never need to go there.  While it's not the perfect world answer, it gives me my instant notification.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: I have switched to AltaMail (info) which handles notifications for IMAP, POP & Exchange via either a forwarding address or a Mac/PC application on my own computer. Not quite as simple as Apple Mail but you can add contact sounds and use the calendar to disable for meetings.\n\nA: I've spent way too many hours on this. As of Today July 10th 2014, if you are on IOS 6, the only FREE solution available to have that precious PUSH instant notification and yet manage the sound alerts without having a slow app (or something that will drain your battery), is to have both Altamail and Gmail installed for 2 different purposes.\nI've installed Altamail, then forward my Gmail account to Altamail (by following the instruction they provide), and than, within Altamail, set the email notification the way I want it using filters (the Mail equivalent of VIPs) cuz I dont want to receive an alert for ALL my messages!).\nThen I put Altamail somewhere on my iphone where I dont see it, cuz I'm actually going to use it only as an app that PUSHES my incoming messages instantly.\nThen I install Gmail, log in, and set notification to NONE. I'm actually going to use Gmail all the time, but I dont want their slow and unpredictable push notification system.\nThen in my Iphone settings:\n- I go to Notification and select Gmail and slide the \"notification center\" button to the left to disable it.\n- Still in my iphone settings, I go to Altamail and enable banners and sounds.\nAnd that's it!\nIt sucks that Gmail or Altamail doesnt provide all these simple features. This is the only FREE solution I've found. Gmail isnt good at sending instant incoming messages and Altamail is way too slow when it comes to opening a message or load the entire conversation. \nSo that way you get both!\nHope this will allow some of you to avoid all the time and energy + useless downloads and useless account creation on many websites + Imap and pop3 information reading I've been through. None of the above solutions really works, even though some of them sound easy and logical (like Icloud or Exchange that dont work anymore)!\n\nA: Gmail app pushes better than any anything available. You just gotta get to know the official Gmail app better, which has improved significantly over the years, and then make an informed decision. Considering the options offered by the official Gmail app bringing in native Gmail webmail features, its definitely better than iOS Mail, though its not as swift in transitions and consumes 60% more battery than iOS Mail.\nIts safer and efficient to sync Contacts and Calendars consolidated as a Google account than separately as CalDav & CardDav.\n\nA: If you want to receive Gmail, contacts, and Calendars on your iPhone, you need to set up 3 different accounts in the mail accounts area:\ngmail - this will push your mail. Don't bother trying to turn on calendar.\nCalDav - This is in the \"other\" section of mail account, and you just set up the serve as google.com and fill in your gmail account info. This will load your calendar.\nCardDav - Same as CalDav set up, and it will load your contacts.\n\nA: Suzumail is a paid app that can push gmail to your iPhone.\n", "Q: Mac hard drive almost full; diagnostic apps do not explain why 157gb of my 159gb mac is showing as used.

Once I've force quit it though, the name disappears forever from the Force Quit dialog and the zombie pid sticks around anyway.\nI'll also note that Finder.app is treated specially in that dialog, where the button text turns from Force Quit to Relaunch, so perhaps that shows that OS X treats killing the Finder as special?\n\nA: When you see a process in parentheses/brackets it means that ps could not determine its command (which appear in the CMD column).

By default Keychain is set to sync it's password with your user account's password, allowing it to unlock when you login to your account, which in turn provides applications & processes access to it's contents.  When you change your password in the Users & Accounts section of System Preferences it communicates the change to Keychain Access, which in turn updates the login.keychain password.\nProblems like this typically arise when a user account password is changed outside of Users & Accounts in System Preferences, by using the Reset Password utility in each OS X installer or by some other means.  When you change the password using one of these alternate methods the change is not communicated to Keychain Access.  When you login and start using the system following one of these changes you will continuously receive prompts similar to the one you've posted.  \nThere are a couple of methods for getting around this and getting things working properly again:\nThe first method is to try any possible passwords that you may have used in the past.  Keychain doesn't have a lockout mechanism that would lock you out after X many tries so feel free to try as many as you can recall.  Assuming this works, and it accepts one of the passwords, you can update the keychain password to match your login password.  This can be accomplished by opening Keychain Access (located in /Applications/Utilities), clicking on Edit in the menubar and choosing \"Change Password for Keychain 'login'\".  This will allow you to enter the original password (whichever one just worked for you) followed by the new password, which should be the same password you use for logging in and/or doing software updates.\nThe second method is to create a new keychain.  You can navigate to /Users/~/Library/Keychains, where ~ represents your user's short name, and locate the login.keychain file.  Change the name of this file to login.keychainold or something similar.  Once you've changed the name log out of your user and log back in.  Within a few seconds one of the many processes should detect that login.keychain no longer exists and prompt you to create one, possibly with the verbiage \"reset to system defaults\", follow the prompts to accomplish this.  When it asks for a password you will enter your login password, the same one you just used to log back in.\n", "Q: how to ungroup windows on mac I am coming from ubuntu. In Mac i notice that multiple browser windows or finder windows don't show up independently in task bar or task switcher. This is causing problems in many operations.\nIs there any switch to activate ungrouped windows?\n\nA: I think almost everyone here is missing the point.   The question really has nothing to do with key bindings.  It is completely centered around application 'grouping' and the granularity in which you can select an application.  Having keyboard access to the individual windows is a secondary issue -- once the apps are accessible individually then we can hope for some key sequence to access each one quickly.\nI have been a Windows user since Windows was invented and a developer even longer so I understand the massive numbers of windows and the desire for keyboard access.  Every day I have a number of VMs open, usually 5 Chrome profiles open with as many as a a hundred or 2 tabs each, etc, etc....\nSo let me screenshot a small example on Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*  This is Grouped.  See that each application is shoved into a pigeon hole (except Chrome which somehow lets you get around that).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*  This is UN-Grouped.  Notice that there is now a separate item/icon for each copy of an application.\n\n\nI have had those same Chrome profiles pinned in the same position for years now and it is a dream to be able to click back and forth without thinking which is which, and with only ONE click, or even Alt+Tab between them.\nI believe this is what the OP desires on the Mac.\n\nWith the MBP the boss decided I should have, none of that seems possible.  I have to Right-Click, go up and find the profile I need, and click again.   As far as I can tell, even using Cmd+Tab cannot granular enough for this.  Thus making it impossible to flip back and forth quickly - which I do constantly...... Constantly!!!!!\n\nOne option I found\nis to disable the Minimize windows into application icon option in Dock and Menu Bar Settings:\n\nThen [only when items are minimized] you can access them individually:\n\n\n\n\nFrankly, in difference to another comment here, I find the Group windows by application in Mission Control settings a bit helpful.  At least by opening the Mission Control view, the apps are close together and named rather than being strewn all over the screen.\n\nCompared to the (contrived but realistic) ungrouped chaos:\n\n\n\n\nFinally - to my answer\nCurrently, I have settled on the app called AltTab: https : / / alt-tab-macos . netlify . app\nNotice here that multiple copies of apps are separated:\n\nThe apps are in order of last usage -- making it very simple to jump back and fourth between windows - no matter what app they belong to.\nIt has a lot of options for your own likings: (I don't have enough rep to post another screenshot)\nAnd even better, a secondary hotkey is like an alt-tab for the current app. (I used Alt+`)\n\nTHAT is really Cool !\n\nYou can even Close, Minimize, Maximize the windows directly from there.\n\nA: I found that going to System Preferences -> Mission Control -> Then untick \"Group windows by application\"\nThen using F3 shows all open windows. You still have to use the mouse to select, but I'd be surprised if that's not fast enough.\nAlso, leverage CMD + H for hiding applications you aren't using so when you press F3, there are fewer windows confusing your selection.\n\nA: I believe that you should try to adapt to a different workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could press ⌘+` to cycle all the windows of the same application.\nNote: this is not the apostrophe key, it's the backtick key.\nNon-shifted tilde ~ left of z on a UK keyboard, left of 1 on US.\n\n*Try App Exposé:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trackpad\nSystem Preferences → Trackpad → More Gestures → App Exposé to configure your preferred gesture.\n\n*Keyboard\nPress F10\nI understand this is not a precise answer to your question, but I believe that switching from Win/Linux to Mac OS, involves some adaptation.\n\nA: You can choose an individual window by either right-clicking, Ctrl-clicking, or clicking and holding on an application's icon in the Dock (task bar) and selecting from the menu.\n\nA: I think best solution for us is to bind keys for switching entire desktops in mission control. That way you can at least do something similar to this. But once you have 2 windows on same desktop you definitively need a mouse or complicated keybindings with more then 1 hit.\n\nA: You can get app switchers like Witch which add the Windows way of switching between Windows in different apps like Microsoft Windows does see this question or this \n", "Q: How can I create plaintext files with Markdown syntax and convert them to PDF format? I am very much a novice at this, so please bear with me.\nI'm intrigued by the idea of using Markdown. I want to be able to write my stuff in a plaintext editor on OS X and iOS and save it in Dropbox in .txt format using a Markdown syntax. I don't want to save my files in markdown format but as plain text. I need support for footnotes, so the Multimarkdown syntax seems like an obvious option.\nWhat tools can I use on OS X and iOS to convert my .txt files, marked up with a Markdown syntax, to .pdf format? Is this even possible?\nThanks for reading.\n\nA: I use Marked to process text files to pdf routinely.\nNo matter what editor you use, Marked will open and re-save a PDF generated from the plain text input by opening and re-saving the file. \nIt also saves to HTML or RDF output from markdown.\nIn reality, any program that renders markdown could print to PDF using OS X core services (File -> Print -> PDF -> Save as PDF), but I much prefer having Marked for it's multitude of handy and flexible processing options and it's ability to live preview markdown files as I edit them in another editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Printing: TOC, suppressing link underline colors, better page breaks\n\n*Multiple styles of markdown rendering\n\n*Support for custom processors, all manner of smart (and dumb) typography\n\n*overall clean, fast, robust, elegant software for a very reasonable price\n\n\nA: install markdown (which is a perl script) from here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n(Alternately you can use homebrew (Link) to install markdown, or one of the many enhanced markdown utilities)\nThen once you have your markdown text file (say it's text.md) you can simply run:\n$ perl *pathto*/markdown.pl text.md > text.html in the terminal\nthen open the resulting text.html in Safari (or any other web browser) and Print to PDF.\nIf you are extensively converting markdown to pdf you can simplify this by using pandoc: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/\nBetter yet, there are a number of text editors designed specifically for Markdown that seem to do the job for you. (Though you may want to check for pdf export... for example iA Writer only exports to RTF or HTML... the conversion of one of those to PDF is trivial, but it's an extra step).\nMany general purpose text editors (TextMate, BBEdit) can be used well for Markdown. (For example in the latest TextMate 2 Beta you can select Preview from the Markdown bundle and then export the formatted document to PDF from the Print dialog.)\n\nA: *\n\n*brew install pandoc\n\n*Install MacTex and add /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/universal-darwin/ to the path\n\n*pandoc input.md -o output.pdf\nI don't know how to change the styles. pdflatex also gave me errors for some non-ASCII characters.\n\n\n*\n\n*--strict acts like Markdown.pl\n\n*-p preserves tabs\n\n*-s --toc adds a TOC (-s / standalone adds headers and footers)\n\n*-S enables smart punctuation\n\n\nYou could also convert to HTML and then to PDF:\nsudo gem install wkpdf\npandoc --strict -p input.md -c style.css -o temp.html\nwkpdf -s temp.html -m 10 -o output.pdf\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-s = source\n\n*-m 10 reduces the default margins\n\n", "Q: iOS: Sounds when Headphones Are Plugged in but Silent Otherwise? Is it possible to set up an iOS 6 device (for example, specifically the iPhone 5, or 3rd generation iPad) such that all the usual sounds from apps and the system sounds like typing or message notifications play when the headphones are plugged in, but when headphones are not plugged in the device is silent?\n\nA: The silent switch on the left of the device allows one to completely mute (orange in picture below) or unmute all sounds when no headphones are plugged in.\nHowever, when headphones are plugged in, third-party app sounds (e.g.: game music/sfx, video sounds, etc.) will still play through the headphones whether the switch is activated or not.\nUnfortunately, there is currently no way to achieve the same behavior for system sounds and Apple apps.\n\n\nA: For media sounds, it will use different level when the headphones are plugged in.\nTo do this, you turn down the volume to nothing while an app using media sound is active and your headphone is not plugged in. Plug in your headphone, and you will see that the volume comes back on.\nBut for notifications and ringtone sounds, it will use same volume regardless of headphones plugged in or not. There are no settings available for differentiating this, I'm afraid.\n\nA: The headphone port consists of small metal ridges which come in contact with the lines on the connector portion of the headphones.\nIf these are pushed in it may not be able to emit sound without headphones because it believes headphones are plugged in. \nLikewise, if the logic board believes these are plugged in no sound will be emitted without headphones either.\nThis is a hardware issue that can be address at Apple Retail or AppleCare \nThe other potential issue is if Do Not Disturb is enabled, a crescent moon icon will be present by the battery icon, no ringing/notification will occur.\n", "Q: Where are login options stored? How can I read Login options from terminal (Automatic login, Display login windows as, Network Account Server etc.)? \n\nA: Most of these settings are stored in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist. The \"Show fast user switching menu\" setting is stored at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist (for each user account on the system).\nThe Network Account Server settings are stored in your Directory Services database. You can utilize the dscl command to look at various settings dealing with your Network Account Server. I recommend using man dscl to look at the details of this function, but as an example I can use the following command to see the Active Directory domain I'm bound to at work:\ndscl localhost -ls /Active\\ Directory\nFor Open Directory you would use:\ndscl localhost -ls /LDAPv3\nAdditional Note from OP: .plist files are coded in binary. To read them in Terminal you will want to make a copy of the file that you can tinker with, and convert that copy into XML format. Use the cp command to create your copy and plutil -convert xm11 examplefile.plist to convert to readable XML.\n", "Q: Plug headphone not support with macmini I have a Macmini 4,1. I tried to use plug headset with mic for skype call, but it doesn't work.\nI can hear the voice from the other end, but my voice can't be heard on the other end. I tried with two or three headsets, but results the same.\nThen, a friend asked me to try using USB headset, I brought it from one neighbour and now it works fine.why?\nIs it a problem of my macmini, or all macmini would behave like this?\nReferring to the answer, I have to decide to buy a new USB headset or not.\n\nA: Here are the specs for this mini according to Wikipedia. Note that this Mac (and most Macs I'm familiar with) has an audio line-in which is a high-level input, but no mic-in (low level). That means you'll need an external microphone amplifier between the mic and the line-in input. The USB mic is doing all of that for you - amplifying the mic and converting the audio signal to digital.\n\nA: When you plug the cable in for the microphone, you may also need to enable this input in System Preferences. Go to System Preferences > Sound > Input and make sure your headset is listed and selected here.\nI've found that USB audio devices typically auto-select themselves when plugged in, but devices plugged into the audio jacks don't normally auto-select.\nIf this doesn't work for you, you may need to get the Mac mini looked at by a tech, as it could be indicative of an actual hardware problem.\n\nA: New Mac Minis have \"Mic In\" ports, but you have to use the 4-conductor phone-type plug - the mic in is one of the contacts on the headphone-out plug. \nSo in this case you'd need an adapter (like what you'd use to use the headset with an iPhone).\n", "Q: iPad mini model 1454 not supported LTE today I went to my services provider to get the 4G network to my iPad mini and I was just knowing that the 4G will not working with ipad mini model A1454 except in USA and Canada what should I do to get the 4G I'm so disappointed by this , I appreciate ur help within these. \nThnx \nGhazi   \n\nA: The iPad Mini model A1454 is designed and will only work on LTE bands 4 (AWS) and 17 (700b MHz).\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/ipad/LTE/\nSince 4G means so much, you may have to ask your specific carrier if they use either of these LTE bands. Even if your carrier operates in those bands, there still isn't a guarantee they support iPad so you'd really need to research that with them directly (or at least consult their website).\nIn addition to LTE, the mini is listed as supporting these other data protocols and frequencies at http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/\n\n\n*\n\n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\n*UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n\nIn the US - these bands are marketed as 4G from AT&T and speeds are possible to overlap with LTE speeds even without connecting over LTE. If you are disappointed with your purchase, hopefully the vendor can assist you with a return or at worst, you can work on selling your iPad since new devices with no scratches can often sell for list price or even higher in some circumstances.\n", "Q: Multiple Apple ID in Messages.app We use two independent Apple IDs in Messages.app, which I want to keep private. But if I log out of one and log in with the second one within Messages (not the computer itself, but the Apple ID in the Messages.app), the conversations from the previous account are still online, and the second person can see them. Is there a way to link the conversations to the account, so that they dont show up unless you are logged into the account that sent them?\n\nA: I haven't found a way to share iCloud accounts for a different reason. Apple suggests keeping separate computer accounts to handle multiple users on a single computer and provides no support for your use case.\nEach computer account can have it's own iCloud account associated without conflict. Using fast user switching to move between logins is the safest way. Using two different iCloud accounts with Messages (or any other service) at the same time on the same login is not supported. You can end up with undesirable behavior if you bounce between iCloud accounts as a single user.\niTunes store accounts seem more robust with respect to switching under a single login because Apple has been forced to deal with large number of users who use different accounts for the iTunes Music Store and iCloud and have purchases spanning both accounts and need to log in/log out to validate DRM.\n", "Q: Apple Mail make mails unsigned by default I have lost patience with outlook and have started using apple mail with my corporate exchange account.\nA problem is that every mail I send by default picks up an ios developer certificate that i have associated with this e-mial address.\nI know you can click on the button on each mail to turn off signing that message, but i'd like the default to be NOT to sign each message i create.\nJ\n\nA: Try this.

Choose your account then at the very bottom change TLS Certificate to \"None\".\n", "Q: How to determine which apps iTunes will copy from iOS, to stop a deleted app being resurrected? I don't sync my iPad often, but when I do I almost always get the following question from iTunes: ' iTunes has found purchased items on the iPad [or iPhone] \"[device name]\" that are not present in your iTunes library. Do you want to transfer these items... ', as in:\n\nThis creates a problem because I intentionally delete apps from iTunes that I no longer want. Then, if I answer \"Transfer\" to the question (as I often do since I'm worried about losing something else that I actually did buy on the iPad), then iTunes transfers the deleted-in-iTunes apps back into iTunes, doh!, even though those apps were not purchased recently on the iPad.  So:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to find out which apps iTunes wants to sync before answering the question, so I can purge the unwanted ones from the iPad before sync and avoid the resurrection?\n\n*To fully delete an app without resurrecting it and without potentially losing anything else, must I delete it in iTunes and across all iOS devices it lives on or is there an easier way I'm missing?\n\n*If I check the \"Do not ask me again\" box, what does iTunes do the next time it encounters this issue:  (a) always Don't Transfer, (b) always Transfer, or (c) always what I answered the time I selected the checkbox?  Where might I see/change this option in iTunes, if I ever change my mind?\n\nA: To answer your specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*No, there is no way to find out which apps iTunes would like to sync over before answering the question. Technically I suppose you could look at your iTunes App Library and your iPad's installed apps, but that is not a very realistic option if you have more than a few apps.\n\n*As far as I've been able to tell, yes you must delete this app from all devices (iTunes and iOS devices) when you have app syncing enabled. Otherwise it will continue to copy back and forth as devices are plugged in.\n\n*Checking the \"Do not ask me again\" box will have iTunes always perform whichever option you selected the time you selected the checkbox. To reset any such settings, you can go to iTunes > Preferences > Advanced, and click the button that says \"Reset all dialog warnings\".\nIn general, given the problem you are having with app syncing, I recommend that you simply disable app syncing. There is no practical benefit for most users in having the apps saved to your computer. Your computer is incapable of playing the apps and generally your iOS device can remove and re-download the app directly from Apple as needed. I disabled my app syncing for the very same reason.\n\nA: This may help to determine which app(s) are the culprit.\nIn iTunes, I clicked on the \"Apps\" icon at the top left, then on \"App Store\" at the top, then on \"Purchased\" on the right hand side\", then on \"Not in My Library\".\nAnd, lo and behold, in my case there were some apps that had the iCloud symbol, i.e., that were not present locally in my apps library.\nI hope there is a way for you to delete those apps permanently from your library / purchased items.\n", "Q: Cannot Save/Edit to Mac Share Using Mountain Lion The problem: Under Mountain Lion (10.8.3) I cannot create new files or save changes to a particular share, which is running Lion (10.7). \nI can connect to the shared Mac on my local network (in a business location).

Type your password to allow this.\" This is strange, nonstandard behavior for an already-autheticated admin user doing a simple copy operation to the remote machine. \n\n*If I type my password and continue, I get another dialog that says \"A newer item named [file name] already exists in this location. Do you want to replace it with the older one you're moving?\" This is a bogus error, because a newer version of the file did not exist on the remote server. If I click \"Keep Both\", Finder seems to hang, but it actually begins to create tens of thousands of zero byte files on the remote server: file name-1.png, file name-2.png, etc., all the way up to file name-30000 or so if I don't stop it. However, if I click \"Stop\" instead of \"Keep Both\", it cancels. If I click \"Replace\" it creates a zero-byte file with the correct name, and then gives an error that says \"The operation can't be completed because an item with the name \"\" already exists.\"\n\n*Console reports an error when I try to copy to the remote machine: Application App:\"Finder\" [ 0x0/0x25025]  @ 0x0x7fc4ea63e640 tried to be brought forward, but isn't in fPermittedFrontASNs ( ( ASN:0x0-0x4d04d:) ), so denying.

This issue only affects my new iMac running Mountain Lion. In this case, Mountain Lion was factory installed. However, I imported my user settings from my old Mac Pro during the install process. \nThis problem is very similar to one reported by another user at Network share permissions problems in Mountain Lion, but there are some differences, so I asked a separate question. Among other things, there are no applications on my system that \"ignore the problem\" as in that user's case. \nWhat I've tried/verified:\n\n\n*\n\n*I routinely repair permissions on my iMac, so I'm sure that is not the issue.\n\n*I have verified that the files/folders have the correct sharing permissions.\n\n*Other uses, including a Mountain Lion user on another machine, can copy/save files to the remote computer.\n\n*Deleting the Finder preferences file (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist) did not help.\n\n*Logging is as the Guest user on my local machine, I could connect and copy files to the remote computer. This suggests the issue is limited to my local user account. \n\n*If I use Terminal to do the copy, I get an \"Operation not permitted\" error. It creates a zero KB file on the destination server, as before. However, I discovered by accident that if I immediately do the same command line copy operation again, without deleting the zero KB file, it successfully copies. I guess for now this will be my workaround.\n\n\nA: After spending maybe 12 hours or more troubleshooting this issue over the past month or so, and realizing it was isolated to my user account, I decided to recreate my user account from scratch. This has solved the problem, and I am now able to connect to the remove server and add/edit files without difficulty.\n\nA: I have similar messages.  I suspect this is an Access Control List problem.\nIn Terminal, enter \"/bin/ls -le /Volumes\" to see if there are ACL entries.  \nACL entries can be cleared --sometimes-- by \"/bin/chmod -N .\" for the current directory.  \"sudo\" may be required also.  See \"man chmod\" for more info on Access Control List entries.  These were added in 10.4 to match capabilities in Windows Server.

The thing is my old drive is encrypted using FileVault2, and I wonder if I will still be able to access my \"old\" content from my fresh install, i.e to copy some files before formatting it...\nWill my FileVault's Recovery Key do the job?\nAny advice will be appreciated...\nThanks\n\nA: In short, yes. I've just done a similar install, with the old, FileVault 2-encrypted volume on an external drive. When your new OS attempts to mount the encrypted partition, it will request a password. Entering the FV key will allow it to decrypt and mount the drive - I believe you can elect to save the key to your Keychain to avoid having to re-enter the password the next time it mounts.\n", "Q: How to programatically add folder to Spotlight \"do not index\"? Is there any way to programmatically add a folder to Spotlight's \"Privacy\" tab?\nEither through Terminal or Applescript?\nOften I want to click on an item in Spotlight results in Finder, and have that item's folder no longer be indexed.\nI found that if you \nsudo defaults read /Volumes/foo/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions\n\nyou can see an array with all the items excluded.\nBut if you try to \nsudo defaults write  /Volumes/foo/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add '/path/to/folder' \n\nit does NOT get added to the Privacy tab in the Spotlight Preference Panel, nor does it get de-indexed.\n\nA: The VolumeConfiguration.plist has moved\nIt now resides in /System/Volumes/Data/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist.\nYou can easily edit it using /uar/libexec/PlistBuddy\nReading\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print :Exclusions\" /System/Volumes/Data/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist\n\nWriting\nThe zero indicates the element in the array or in this case the beginning of the array\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Add :Exclusions:0 string '/path/to/folder'\" /System/Volumes/Data/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist\n\nDeleting\nThe zero indicates the the first item in the array\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Delete :Exclusions:0 string\" /System/Volumes/Data/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist\n\nRestart the daemon\nEasiest solution to get the change to take effect is reboot, but you can also tell Launchd to restart the mdworkers\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.metadata.mds\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.metadata.mds\n\nmdutil\nIf however, you decide you want to disable spotlight indexing on the whole volume, for example if the machine is a headless build machine, you could just use mdutil.\nmdutil -i off /\n\n\nA: You have to stop and start the launchd service called com.apple.metadata.mds. So after:\nsudo defaults write /Volumes/foo/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add '/path/to/folder'\n\ndo:\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.metadata.mds && sudo launchctl start com.apple.metadata.mds\n\n\nA: According to an answer here, a folder can be excluded from Spotlight indexing (achieving the same effect as adding it to the Privacy tab, although the folder won't actually be listed there) by either\n\n\n*\n\n*adding .noindex to the end of the folder's name, or\n\n*creating an empty file .metadata_never_index inside the folder (eg with touch folder/.metadata_never_index)\n\n\nYou will need to restart Finder after adding  .metadata_never_index, either killall Finder from Terminal or logout from the Apple menu and then log back in. This method doesn't work in Mojave and later. \n\nA: First you have to change the permission settings to add something to the spotlight privacy tab\nsudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP /.Spotlight-V100/\nsudo chmod -R 777 /.Spotlight-V100/\nand then \nsudo defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Exclusions Exclusions -array-add\nshould work.\nAnd don't forget to set it back afterwards.\n\nA: You could also just go to the system prefs pane for Spotlight. There you'll find a privacy tab. Just add the folders and files you don't want to show up in the index. That's it. They've already made it easy so you don't have to use the command line. \nAnd If it's added to the privacy tab you can see what all you have hidden from the index just in case you want to index it it later.\n", "Q: How can I configure my Ethernet connection when booting from Recovery HD?

At work we have a Time Machine drive on the network. I'm trying to restore one of our machine's backup to an external drive. When I boot into the Recovery HD, I can't reach the network drive. Is there a way to restore a Time Machine backup without booting to the Recovery HD?\n\nA: You can restore from a Time machine backup with the Migration Assistant app. You can find it at /Applications/Utilities/\nI have never used it with networked Time Machine drives.\n", "Q: Find individual users' backup size in Time Capsule I'm the administrator of a 2 TB Time Capsule, to which my co-workers connect via individual accounts. I recently noticed a sudden jump in usage — from ~1 TB (0–1 over the course of 8 months) to ~1.5 TB (1–1.5 in a span of 2 weeks). My guess is that one of them downloaded experimental data files (which don't need to be backed up, as they're done so elsewhere) and stored them locally during those two weeks and accidentally backed them up, thus contributing to the bloat.\nIs it possible for me to find out the sizes of these users' backups, so that I can then instruct them to use tmutil to remove only the specific backups with the huge data files? I do not have access to the contents of their backups (at least, not easily and I want to either).\n\nA: You'll want to get a tool like BackupLoupe to introspect each backup event to locate the largest files stored on each interval (or search across all backups to find large folders and files).\nYou could also use a command line tool like tmutil compare or du -sm /whatever/* to calculate sizes and changes - but a graphical tool with searching ability even when the volume is not mounted is far superior for the task of finding large users of space on a Time Machine volume.\n", "Q: Permissions error when downloading or quick-looking attachments in mail.app after symlinking Mail Downloads directory Awhile back, I symlinked my ~/Library/Mail Downloads directory to ~/Downloads so that my email attachments would be downloaded to the same location that all my other applications download files to.\nWhen I upgraded to Mountain Lion, I noticed that the Mail Downloads folder had been restored.

Not an obvious choice as a router/firewall, but I had it already and it does handle PPPoE at the cost of one cat5 socket. \nThe downside is that it insists on choosing it's own IP address (from one of 3) and being the DHCP server.

My MacBook is frying my lap, and the CPU monitor is going crazy: over 200% CPU being used by a process named installd.\nWhat is it?  Can I kill it?\n\nA: It's Apple's install process.\nWhat's annoying is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple haven't (as yet) made this less CPU-intensive OR given you the option to do so. Note that the CPU-intensive stage is only at the initial part of the install and does stop.\n\n*you can't quickly see the progress of the Downloads\n\n\nYou can see progress but need to do the following: \nApple logo (top left) > App Store > Updates and click Update.\n\nThis will then reveal a progress bar with the current download state.\n\nA: I used Activity Monitor to kill the process at once. And so:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU returned back to normal;\n\n*A notification from App Store showed up in Notification Center asking for when to install updates.\n\n\nA: It's normally run when you for example install an App Store application or remove an application from Launchpad. It shouldn't stay running in the background or keep using that much CPU though. You can probably just force quit it from Activity Monitor or run sudo killall -9 installd.\nThe binary is in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PackageKit.framework/Resources/installd in 10.8.\n\nA: This is a daemon which is part of PackageKit framework and it's usually running as a background process for the \"Software Update\" GUI application.\nFor example, if you open the Software Update application and check for updates, take a look at the Activity Monitor--you'll see the \"installd\" process doing a bunch of work.\nThe reason it pegs your CPU is because it must compile the current list of software installed on your computer, and compare with the current version list received from Apple's servers.\nYou can set the frequency of Software Update checks in System Preferences and Software Update.\nThe default settings are both to \"Check for updates\" and \"Download updates automatically\".\nYou may adjust either setting, but I would not recommend turning it off altogether.\nThere's nothing wicked about this process - it's just set to download updates.\nYou can solve your CPU problem by lowering the priority of the process or by just killing the process in Activity Monitor.\n\nTechnical information:\nThe location in Lion OSX is in:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PackageKit.framework/Resources/installd\n(if you have locate configured correctly, run: locate installd to find the right location).\n\nA: Mine was installd and storeagent - so I just killed them:\nsudo killall -9 installd\nsudo killall -9 storeagent\n\n\nA: Installd is a process run by Sophos anti virus.

I've just replaced my MacBook Pro's optical drive with an SSD. I used OWC's Data Doubler kit. I've moved my OS and all my data onto the SSD, and I'm now using it as my boot volume. \nIn other threads, some people have swapped the positions of the drives, so that the HDD is installed where the optical drive was, and the SSD is installed at the HDD's original location.\nIs there any good reason to do this?  Does it matter where the SSD drive is installed? In particular, would this configuration have any impact on battery life?  \n\nA: Yes this does matter depending on the sata speed of your hdd, ssd and the laptop.\nMy 2011 MacBook Pro supports 6 Gb/s to the original hdd and 3 to the Optical drive.\nMy ssd supports 6 Gb/s and my original hdd supports 3 gb/s.\nObviously, I did not put the ssd in the optical bay caddy (which would have been less work). Instead, I moved the original hdd to the caddy an placed the ssd where the hdd originally used to be.\nThis way, my ssd runs at 6gb/s and my hdd (still) at 3 Gb/s.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The described question is what I have done with my 2011 MBP \nhttp://i.imgur.com/0J2dV6L.png?1\n\n", "Q: Charge cycles increase? This is a bit weird, I've been doing everything to keep the battery health great and that's what i achieved so far. it's going through 99-100%, but the thing is.. those charging cycles thing are increasing everyday, yesterday it was 32 and today it became 36 even though the health is going well, How to keep it low ? isn't the health dedicated to those cycles ? and which is more important the health or the cycles ?\n\nA: Your charge cycles increase every time you cycle through the the equivalent of a full battery charge. Mac laptops made since the \"unibody\" style was released use lithium polymer batteries which should retain 80% of their battery power after 1000 charges. (So if you got 7 hours out of the box, you should still be getting 5.5 hours.)\nIn general I wouldn't worry too much about your battery health. Lithium polymer is extremely flexible as a battery technology and Apple makes some of the best batteries in the electronics industry. The only way to really ruin the battery is to keep it plugged in 100% of the time. Unplug it at least once a month for 5-10 hours and you should be fine. With 1000 recharge cycles guaranteed Apple is expecting you to replace the system before you ever suffer issues with battery life.\n", "Q: Mail signatures--assigning to specific users Is it possible to assign a Mail signature to specific recipients? I want my signature to appear in emails I send to some people but not appear in emails I send to other people. Thanks.\n\nA: No. This isn't possible with a standard install of OSX Mail.app.\nWhat you can do, as I am sure you are already well aware of, is set up multiple signatures, and manually select the signature that you desire to use. What you can do in the case of wanting no signature is set up a \"signature\" labeled \"Empty\", and then put nothing in there. Then have that set to default, or the other way around.\n", "Q: iPad Mail app doesn't completely search inbox or contact I tried to use my Mail app connected to Hotmail and Gmail to search for emails in my inbox and contacts, but the app doesn't fully search my emails in the inbox nor the contacts I have saved.

I sync some folders within my Home folder between two Macs (running Lion and Mountain Lion) using Synk Pro, a commercial live file sync application. I have the same account name on both computers.\nAfter syncing, some of my files on both computers are read-only, and they also aren't owned by me, but by the macports account – why?\n\nTo be able to modify files, I've used Get Info to change permissions of some files to read/write for 'everyone', and I used the app Permissions Reset to reset permissions back to original, but it doesn't change the permissions of sub-folders/files, and I have a huge file tree, so doing this manually is practically impossible. And Disk Utility does nothing to user data.\nHow can I fix this?\n--\nAdded info:\nAs suggested, I ran the commands id -u and id -u macports on both computers. The result is that on the MacBook Pro, my account has uid 501 and macports has uid 502, and on the iMac it's the other way around.\n\nA: The files appearing read-only to you is probably only because you are currently not their owner.\n    What's likely happening is that the synced files retain the numeric owner-id from the source machine, and since that numeric uid in this particular case corresponds to the account macports on the target machine (in both transfer directions), macports has become the owner.\nTo verify that your account on each computer has the same numeric uid as the macports account has on the other machine, type the commands id -u and id -u macports in the Terminal in your account on both computers.\nFixing the cause of the problem\nWhen information was submitted that the syncing is done using Synk Pro, I had a look at the Synk Pro web site and the app, and in the 'Advanced' settings I noticed the \"Ownership:\" option, which by default is set to \"Copy If Possible\".\n    Since it looks like Synk Pro transfers files' numeric uid, and there's no option for mapping this uid to another uid/account on the target computer, the way to make synced files be owned by you is to change the \"Ownership:\" setting to \"Ignore\".\n\nFixing the files\nTo fix the permission problem for the already synced files, you only need to change the owner of the files to your own account. Since (in this case) all of your synced folders are within your Home folder /Users/youraccount, you can do this with the following command in the Terminal when logged in to an administrator account (you'll have to give sudo the password of the admin account):\nsudo chown -R youraccount /Users/youraccount\n\nusing the actual account name (also known as short user name) of your own account in place of youraccount. The account name is the same as the name of your account's Home folder in the /Users folder.\n    This will change all files and folders within the folder /Users/youraccount to be owned by youraccount (-R is for recursive), which should give you write-access to all of your files.\nSince you earlier gave write-permission to 'everyone' for some files to be able to modify them, you may want to remove those permissions. This command:\nsudo chmod -R u+w,go-w /Users/youraccount\n\nensures that the owner of your files, and no-one else, has write permission on them.\nType man chown and man chmod for more info about these commands.\n\nAdvice against using Finder to fix a folder's permissions\n(I will update the below later)\nNote: It is possible to change ownership and permissions of all files and folders in a folder tree using the Finder, by use of the controls at the very bottom of the Sharing & Permissions section of a Get Info window as shown in the picture in the question. One problem with this is that an account's home folder, and the standard subfolders therein, such as Library, Documents, Public and so forth, have special permissions (by use of ACLs) preventing them from being deleted among other things, and you don't want these special permissions to be removed or propagated to other folders and even files, so you should not use this unless you know very well what you are doing.\n\nA: There is a drag-and-drop freeware app with a GUI that can do this for you if you don't want to use Terminal commands. It is called BatChmod. \nBe very careful in using it, or any other method; changing the privileges of a whole directory tree of files at once can have unintended consequences.\n\nA: You can easily do to this in the shell (terminal) like on Linux using chmod\nWhen using chmod, you have the three letters u, g, o (user, group, other) for defining the instance to which you want to give the permission. And the three letters r, w, x (read, write, execute) to define the kind of permission.\nIf you want to give all the read and execute permission, you would use\nchmod ugo +rx target. Similarly, you can take away permissions using - instead of +\n", "Q: USB device accidentally ejects with the slightest disturbance This is extremely annoying. 2009 MacBook Pro running OSX 10.7.5. I have an external hard drive connected via USB for Time Machine purposes. This device, and anything else connected via USB, frequently accidentally ejects with the slightest disturbance such as when I brush against the USB cable. It's very extremely annoying. The trouble doesn't come up as often with devices without a cable like flash drives, but sometimes it happens. It happens very frequently with devices connected via a cable. What is going on?\n\nA: You either have a bad USB cable or a bad USB jack (either on external devices or Mac). I would start by replacing the USB cable on the external hard drive. If that does not work then your USB jack will most likely need to be looked at by an Apple repair center.\n", "Q: Disable \"X New Notifications\" Every time I get a notification, say for my music player when a track is changed, I get that notification in the top right (standard notification center) immediately followed by \"X new notifications\". It happens so quickly that I don't even get a chance to see the original notification. Is there a way to mark these as read, or better yet, disable these rollup notifications?\n\n\nA: Its hard for me to test, but I believe if you set the alert type to banners, and then un-tick the show in notification center then it shouldn't show the count.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Notifications\n\n*Select the desired app from the list\n\n*Select 'Banners' as the alert style\n\n*Un-tick the option Show in Notificaion Center: X Recent Items\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are getting flooded with notifications.  They're coming in so fast that the Notification Center is summarizing them instead of displaying them.  So you probably should turn off some notifications.   \nSome apps let you select, in the application's preferences, what to notify you about.  For example, Sonora probably lets you turn off notifications for every track change.  \nIf the apps don't give you enough control, then you have to go to System Preferences -> Notifications, select the app, set the Alert Style to \"None\" (rather than Banners or Alerts) and uncheck \"Show in Notification Center\".\nOne way to track the source of the too many alerts is enable \"Badge app icon\" while disabling everything else for all the apps.  Then you can look at your applications' icons and see which ones are generating huge numbers. \n\nA: The only thing you can really do is to adjust the notification center settings for the particular apps. Therefore open up the notification center pane, click on the preferences button in the bottom right corner and adjust the settings in the windows that just popped up.\n", "Q: Tethered jailbreaked iPhone 4S is stuck on the Apple logo because the battery died It's impossible to put it on DFU mode because it won't turn off and I don't know what to do.\niTunes won't recognise it either.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: I fixed it. I won't delete the question because I think this may help other people... but if mods want to delete it, then go ahead.\nToday when I woke up the battery had died again, so I took advantage of this (because now it won't turn on everytime I tried to turn it off). Redsn0w has an option to boot the iphone/ipod if it's off while on tethered jailbreak, but it won't work with iphone 4S because it has A5, not A4; but I used the DFU instructions there to make sure it was done correctly (there's no screen that will tell you it's on DFU mode, but redsn0w will pop up a message telling you it doesn't support your device).

I called Apple's toll free number but wasn't able to get a clear answer from them. \nMy 2011 MacBook Air's battery is dying and I would like to have it replaced. The only problem is that I am traveling abroad soon (in 3 days). If I go to an Apple Store to have it replaced, will they do it on site such that I can get my laptop back right away, or will they keep my laptop for a few days to replace the battery? \nWhen I was talking to a rep on the phone, he recommended that I just go to the store and get the problem assessed. But the closest Apple store is about an hour away...Thanks!\n\nA: There is a problem with your MBA if a battery gets drained too fast after 1-1/2years or 600 days. Getting a new battery won't solve that problem.\nOpen Activity Monitor and look at CPU usage. \nIt should go to zero if you are not doing anything. \nIf not there is your problem, but I cannot answer what to do, till you tell us what.\nCheck your charger, making sure the battery is 100% before disconnecting.\nDischarge the battery overnight, see instructions http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html.\nGo to the apple store, with an appointment, they will replace it in an hour, for $130 or so.\nIf you are handy with screwdriver there are DIY on the web for that.\nNow to my question:. How the heck did you get 1200 cycles in 600 days?. \nA charge cycle means using all of the battery’s power, but that doesn’t necessarily mean a single charge. For instance, you could use your notebook for an hour or more one day, using half its power, and then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it would count as one charge cycle, not two, so it may take several days to complete cycle.\nWhat this says in your case, you had 2 cycles per day? (600x2=1200)\n\nA: In 2022 this depends. Many batteries are glued to the top case, so the batteries may or may not be swapped locally or sent out to a repair center with larger staff and parts warehoused outside the retail store.\nWhen this question was asked, it was nearly 100% yes - all computer batteries from Apple (including the newer unibody models where the battery is not consumer replaceable) are easily swapped in a 10 to 35 minute procedure to open, inspect, replace, test and document the repair. This assumes the technician has all the parts, adhesives, solvents in place and has done a dozen or so of this exact model so they only have to refresh the steps and not have to carefully study the manual and find each screw and piece to remove.\nOf course, your wait time might be longer if no one is free to start work immediately or the part needs to be retrieved from a nearby stock room. If the part isn't in stock, Apple should be able to quote you a delivery time to order the part, and discuss if you want to leave the Mac for service, choose mail in service or leave with your mac and return later to get the repair done as same- or next-day service once the part and the Mac are in the shop together.\nSince you called AppleCare and explained your symptoms, my guess is they cannot run the diagnostics remotely to establish a true failure (or if you agree to pay for the repair) and pre-order the part before you present the Mac for repair in the store.\nMy experience is each store has sufficient stock to do several repairs of a battery type, but that being said, I've also gone in on a busy day where they had three machines needing the same part as I and I was the third in line and therefore had the option of leaving the Mac or waiting for the part to arrive.\nWorst case, you get a diagnosis and don't leave the machine in for repair, but have options to pre-order the part when you return or find another store. If the store mails in your Mac for repair, often it can get overnighted to a return location of your choosing and clearly wherever they ship the machine will be same day service for an in-stock battery at the main repair depot.\nSince a few years before Covid, I’ve personally been all in on arranging service for everything online first and having a box shipped to my house / business even with multiple retail stores within 25 minute drive. Staffing online and remote diagnosis replace much of what I needed to get in person previously. The iPad and iOS app is easiest for me, even arranging Mac repairs.\n", "Q: DLNA via bridged interfaces - OS X Setup is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Primary network is via en0 (192.168.1.0/24)\n\n*Secondary network is via en1 and contains a DLNA server (192.168.2.0/24). This is 'private' network containing only en1 and the DLNA device, with no router etc.\n\n\nI'd like for devices on the primary network to be able to communicate with/stream from the device on en1. Both networks are connected to a machine running OS X 10.8.\nI've tried various combinations of bridge ('ipconfig bridge create' etc), natd, and sysctl in an attempt to arrive at some kind of functional solution and have consistently failed.\nCan this be done, and if so, what is my target configuration?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I'm assuming that these are separate networks with their own gateway to the Internet and that the OSX box is just a computer on both LANs (It's not their gateway)?\nBridging the networks has just effectively put a link cable between the two networks. Hosts on 1.x trying to send data to 2.x will just forward the packets to their default gateway which won't know what to do with them.\nYou could add a 1.x alias to the media server and keep the bridge but that's quite ugly and running two LANs on top of each other is generally discouraged. In addition, if you really wanted to do this it'd make more sense to just link the two networks with a cable rather than bridge them on a host.\nThe ideal solution is to probably have the default gateway on each network a router capable of routing between the two. However the routers would both need an interface on their respective LAN and an interface to connect the two routers together, plus relevant routes (at the simplest a static route on each) which probably won't be possible with the equipment you have.\nBy far the easiest solution is to merge the networks and move 2.x stuff onto 1.x or visa-versa, which ever is the least problematic.\n\nA: I am wondering whether this led to any working solutions. I have a mostly identical situation and haven't found a good solution yet. Let me try and clarify ax to the why of this particular configuration. \nIn my case I have a Mac connected to \"the Internet\" (obviously via my home router) through it's Wifi interface. My DLNA server (a Synology NAS) is connected directly to the same Mac using a wired Ethernet connection. \nWhy not connect my DLNA server to the router? Wiring constraints! Yes I could solve these, but for now I would like to find it if it is at all possible to get this setup working.\nI've created a bridge and connected both my wireless and wired interfaces to it. That's the easy part. However, as you already pointed out this creates a somewhat unclear situation: two different subnets are now connected to a bridge and because they are different subnets they still can't talk to each other even though they are \"connected\". At the IP level, things aren't as they should: getting from one network to the other requires a (default) gateway in the respective networks. \nThe problem is that different networks are now connected at L2, and this shouldn't be done. One resolution might be to make sure that both interfaces are on the same network, but this creates a new problem: two of the Mac's interfaces are then on the same network and this causes an unclear routing decision for traffic sent from the Mac, since both interfaces present a default gateway for traffic outside these networks. To solve this, something has to be done to make sure that one of these interfaces (in this example the Wifi) is always used as the default. Furtermore, traffic destined for the DLNA server must always be routed to the wired Ethernet interface. I have not found a working solution for this yet.\nYou point out that giving the bridge itself an IP address on the \"Internet facing\" network should do the trick, without having to put both interfaces on the same subnet. I am curious to find out how this would work. Assuming that both interfaces remain, the only thing that changes is that they are bridged together with a logical bridge that has it's own address. How precisely would that alter OS X's network behaviour?\nCheers,\nFrank\n\nA: Just had this problem myself. My setup is a media server on one bridged router with ip-192.168.1.2 bridged to another router with internet =ip-192.168.1.1.\nMy media server is 192.168.1.222, I simply put this ip on the DMZ for router 192.168.1.2\nAs internet traffic still has to pass through 192.xxxx.1 I think its perfectly safe! Not sure what advanced setting you need in order to get your router to distribute dlna information, but my cheap TP link hasn't got the options without installing openwrt or some such ilk.\nAfter putting it in the DMZ works a charm! :)\n", "Q: system_profiler applications inventory Running this:\nsystem_profiler -detailLevel full\n\nproduces an inventory of applications, among other things.\nHow does they system \"know\" about these apps?\n\n\n*\n\n*Spotlight?

Do you have a startup disk or clone from which you can run Disk Utility, which is the only way to fully repair a disk? Not that such can necessarily fix every problem, but a hard disk cannot fully repair itself.\nDoes a Safe Boot work? Holding down Command-Shift at startup.

However, when I click on a link i.e. in Mail it opens it not in the active window but in the minimized one instead (the one that has been created first after opening the Safari).\nHow can I set the Safari to open links in the currently active window, not a minimized one?\n\nA: I believe the default behavior of Safari is to open a link in the oldest open window. Minimized windows tend to get old, hence the annoyance of Safari bringing up minimized windows when opening a link from another app.\nYou can easily test this. Wait for it to happen. Then re-minimize the window. The behavior should be repeatable infinitely. Next copy the URL of the window you want minimized and close that window. Open a new window, paste the URL, hit return, and minimize it. Then open the external link and it will no longer go to that window.\nOf course this doesn't help - it just explains the behavior. The only thing that might eventually help is filing a bug report:\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html\n\nA: This was happening to me too. I read Adam's answer. Didn't follow it exactly as it lost me a little but tried something anyways...\nHad 3 open Safari windows, each with many tabs and all full-screened. Links were opening in one of the ones I myself had put to the LH side of all my Spaces (because I keep my active stuff to the RH side) and use full-screen mode for most apps.\nI minimised the two on the LH side. Opened a new tab in the one I want/my active one and now the link finally opens in that window!\n", "Q: Making a micro MacBook Air (headless) Here's a project I've been desiring for a while.

In addition to that, shortcuts are assigned mysteriously.\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cleared all global keyboard shortcut assignments.\n\n*Deleted and re-installed Evernote from app store: Same problem.\n\n*Ran AppCleaner and re-installed Evernote from app store: Same problem.\n\n*Deleted Evernote from my keychain and did all steps above: Same problem.\nHere's the discussion on the Evernote Support site. Screenshot below for a quick view:\n\nThe latest Evernote release only has Paste (cmd-V) and Paste As Plain Text (cmd-shift-V). I don't know where my system is getting an additional menu Paste Without Formatting. What's frustrating is that this problem prevents me from using the Paste function through a keyboard shortcut (tried assigning a global one but it doesn't work).\nThere is nothing that overrides \"Paste\" in my Global Application shortcuts. I've even unchecked everything in the other shortcut tabs.\n\nAny idea what's creating this problem, and how I can address it?\nUpdate: It appears to be an account-specific problem. Created a second administrator account, there all the menus were right. Chances are, something in my profile continues to override the menu.\nFinal Update: The solution should have been fairly simple: assign a new shortcut to the ghost menu item, Paste Without Formatting so that it releases its link to Cmd-V. The problem was that Evernote was reading its shortcuts configuration somewhere else. I even did a full grep of my entire Mac for the phrase above, no result. What fixed the issue? I upgraded my OS to 10.8 and voila! Evernote started accepting new shortcut assignments. That allowed me to restore the original Paste shortcut.\nThanks to everyone who helped out on this problem.\n\nA: I can replicate this if I set the Paste Without Formatting Menu item to have an hotkey using the system Preferences 'keyboard shortcuts'.\n\n\nI set the shortcut in 'Application Shortcuts' and the chose Evernote.app rather than All Applications.\nRemoving the Setting will put things back to normal.\nUpdate:\nSince the OP. Confirms they once did set a global hotkey and since removed it. But the menu shortcut persist. \nI re-did my global hotkey and  then deleted the reference from the com.apple.universalaccess.plist file.  \nThis resulted in the global hotkey being removed from the System preferences global shortcuts. But in Evernote the global shortcuts still appeared.\nThis is what the OP. seem to have.\nMy simple fix for this was.\nRe do the global shortcuts for \"Paste Without Formatting\" in the System preferences global hotkeys. Giving it a new shortcut.\nCheck to see if Evernote picked it up, which it did.\nAnd then deleting it in the System preferences.\nThis removed it from Evernote.\n", "Q: Boot Camp 5 drivers will not install in Windows 8 I have a Macbook Pro Early 2011 and I had Windows 7 installed on it through boot camp.I recently upgraded to windows 8 by using an upgrade CD. When I upgraded I had Boot Camp 2.3 installed and that was not working with windows 8. So I downloaded Boot Camp 5 Drivers and tried to install them but every time the installation fails because it says that it requires windows 7. Is there some way to work around this? Or do I need to go back to windows 7 then install the drivers then go to 8?     \n\nA: According to Apple BootCamp 5 page, you must install the BC 5 drivers before upgrading to Win 8.

On Ask Different there are many questions regarding the PATH environment variable and how to set it for applications launched by a shell, by spotlight or via the finder (typical questions: How to set PATH for Finder-launched applications or How to change PATH environment variable...).\nAnswers range from sh startup scripts to /etc/paths to /etc/launchd.conf. Here I am after the answer for a unified setting of PATH for all apps under Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2.\n\nA: Expanding on the previous answer, to change the path in /etc/launchd.conf, you'll need to do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have Administrator privileges.\n\n*Create a new text file with the following content, modified to fit your needs:\nsetenv PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/Users/YourUserName/bin\n\n\n*Save it in your home directory as launchd.conf.\n\n*Open Terminal.app (or your favorite substitute) and type:\nsudo mv ~/launchd.conf /etc\nDepending on your previous usage of the sudo command, you may get a short \"be careful doing what you're doing\" message, but either way you'll need to enter your password. All the command does is move the file to the /etc directory, which is not directly accessible when saving a file in TextEdit, for example. sudo (short for \"Super User DO\") is used because Administrator privileges are needed to write to that directory.\n\n*Reboot your computer.\nAnd you should be all set. Good luck!\n\nA: After many trials with different options I conclude:\nIs there a unified way to set the PATH for applications launched by different means (like shell script, Finder and Spotlight)? Well, yes and no:\n\n\n*\n\n*No: Setting PATH in shell start up scripts (e.g. .bashrc) works only for apps launched by shells.\n\n*No: Setting PATH for the current launchd process via launchctl setenv PATH <...> does not work for me at all.\n\n*Yes: Setting PATH in /etc/launchd.conf (and restarting the system) will make the appropriate PATH visible in  applications launched by Spotlight, Dock and Finder and subsequently (local) shells. \n\n*No: Remotely invoked shells do not inherit the environment. (See ...why do remote shells via ssh do NOT inherit the environment..) \n\n\nNotes for set-up of shells:\n\n\n*\n\n*For correct functioning in local shells it is important to switch off the use of /usr/libexec/path_helper, because the default paths in /etc/paths might change the order of the paths in PATH.**\n\n*To accommodate remote shells you need to re-import the launchd environment into the shell. Use something like this in your .bashrc:\n# the vexatious path stuff\neval $(launchctl export)\n\nUnfortunate consequences of the whole issue are:\n\n\n*\n\n*No way to have these unified settings on a per user basis. (~/.launchd.conf does not work.)\n\n*No easy way to construct the PATH from different sources using techniques like home directory expansion et al.\n\n\nA: You may give https://github.com/ersiner/osx-env-sync a try.\nIt handles both command line and GUI apps from a single source.

I clicked the 'Compress xxx' option in the popup menu in order to compress a folder of MP3 files, but the result was a .zip file that is almost the same size as before compressing; it seemed to only archive those files.\nHow can I archive them and reduce their size greatly? \nIs there any free app that can do so?\n\nA: As patrix mentioned in the comments, certain types of data (such as MP3, JPEG, MPEG) are not able to be compressed further because they are already compressed.\nCompressing a bunch of MP3 files is not going to do much apart from bundling them together in one archive.\n\nA: As others have pointed out: MP3 data is already data that's been compressed. It's compressed using an algorithm that takes in to account audio data, stripping out the audio data that the algorithm believes to be beyond perception to the average human being. It's a different approach than compression used in tools like zip and rar, but it the end result is mostly the same: you have less data in the file and what you have is less regular, less repeating.\nWhich brings us to how some of these long running compression algorithms work. In the case of the zip format it's generally based on DEFLATE (though not always, but that's the most popular compression approach), a method for reducing the data size in a file that relies on finding repeated data blocks and replacing them with a much shorter blocks that can be used to look up the longer block in a common dictionary. That's a bit of a naïve explanation, but should suffice to give you enough understanding to figure out what's going on here.\nWhen you combine those two facts: that your MP3 data has already been unique-ified by an audio compression algorithm, and that zip compression is looking for commonalities to put in to a dictionary to reduce the file size, you can see why compression an MP3 file doesn't get you much. There isn't much there the algorithm can work with, so the file sizes stay about the same.\nThat doesn't mean you can't build archives out of MP3 files, it just means you have to be smarter about archiving.\nBundling together multiple MP3 files and compressing them en masse is a good strategy for eeking out a little more space saving. By first turning multiple files in to one, larger file, and compressing that larger file, the compression algorithm can look for similarities across all the files. There's a higher probability similarities will be found in this case.\nThere are a few ways you can bundle and compress your data:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Finder, compress an entire folder or tree of folders instead of one file at a time;\n\n*Pre-bundle things using a tool like tar to build a single archive file out of multiple files on disk and than compress the tar file (tar even has built-in gzip compression it can apply to the bundle when you create it so it's one command line call);\n\n*Try other compression tools that use different algorithms and attempt to be more \"multi-file aware\", something like RAR or bzip2 or KGB\n\nA: \n… How can i … reduce their size greatly? …\n\nFor files with content that is not naturally compressed, there are at least two products that can compress without archiving. \nNeither is free but both should be of interest. \nKeyword: AppleFSCompression, also known as HFS Plus Compression.\nClusters\n\n…  takes advantage of the file compression technology in Mountain Lion, Lion and Snow Leopard …\n\nMoreSpace Folder Compression\n\n… HFS+ compression has the best effect on uncompressed file formats like text and data documents, databases and mailboxes. A typical Mail mailbox size can be reduced up to 50%. …\n\nPreference\nOf those two, I find Clusters more mature and easier to use. \n\nProceed with caution\nIn an edge case, silent dataloss may occur with third party uses of AppleFSCompression. From what I can tell this is a bug in the OS, and may occur only where there's an extraordinary lack of free space. I'll feed the bug to Apple. \n", "Q: Time Machine doesn't backup folders with same name as user Let's say my OS X user's folder is called Attila and I have a folder with the same name in a folder, e.g. ~/Xcode/Attila/.

Is there a way to access those apps without entering my passcode every time?  An example of such an app would be the calculator or calendar apps, or even the Pandora app.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: No, although there are/were tweaks available on jailbroken devices that enabled locking specific apps with a(n unrelated) passcode.\n\nA: Yes, Apple provides Siri (voice search, automation, calculator, and much more) and music control plus some notifications that respond to touch when on the lock screen.\nNo, in that you can't choose any app to actually run from the home screen before a passcode or slide to unlock action. \nBack to the yes aspect of the answer, touch and Siri's access is very strictly limited and you don't get to use any apps in their full UI, but instead use Apple controls to automate things like changing volume, skipping to the next song, pausing and playing.\nSimilarly, when you use Siri to access things, you can generally input a new appointment and interact with data stored in an app as opposed to firing up the app's UI (in the case of calculator or other apps you ask about - like perhaps choosing a new playlist in pandora). Siri of course knows how to play music in the library, but not yet how to select a pandora playlist.\nThe prevailing idiom is to select specific apps that themselves have passcodes (banking apps, finance apps, secure work apps for medical data, etc…) and not worry about a device passcode or to just enter the device passcode to run any and all apps.\n", "Q: iCal won't change what calendar events are saved on My usual issue goes something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click to add new event, under the default calendar\n\n*Add details, etc, and save\n\n\nLater on, when I want to move it to a different calendar, I edit it, and change it to a different one via the drop-down.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make edit, click done\n\n*The event will change to the proper calendar\n\n*The event disappears\n\n*The event reappears under the original (default calendar)\n\n\nAll the calendars are on Google Calendars, and synced via CalDAV into iCal as delegates.

I'd like to delete iTunes and never ever have it make it again in my OS X system.\nOn a fresh install of OS X 10.6.8 I had iTunes 10 and noticed that on the first \"Software update\" OS X wants to install iTunes 11.  I unchecked the box next to iTunes 11 and then I uninstalled iTunes manually:\nrm -rf Applications/iTunes.app\n\nThe system rebooted fine and OS X seems to work fine.\nHowever while opening Software Updates I noticed that iTunes 11 was checked again.  So if I didn't uncheck it again I take it it would have installed itself again.\nIs there a way to delete iTunes and tell OS X / Apple to never ever install iTunes again and never check for iTunes updates?  Or are the updates suggestions made from Apple's side, no matter what you have (or have not) installed on your own OS X?\nP.S: I'm using OS X on a Mac in my living room only to listen to my local music collection (never ever streaming from the net) using Cog and to watch movies and that's it.\n\nA: I haven't tested this yet, but softwareupdate seems to support adding ignored updates:\nsoftwareupdate --ignore iTunes\n\n--ignore ...\n            Manages the per-machine list of ignored updates.\n\n--reset-ignored\n            Clears the list of all ignored updates.\n\n[...]\n\nsudo softwareupdate --ignore iCal iPhoto\n\n      Ignored updates:\n      (iPod, SafariUpdate)\n\nThis might prevent iTunes from getting reinstalled when you upgrade OS X:\nsudo rm -r /Applications/iTunes.app\ntouch /Applications/iTunes.app\nchflags hidden /Applications/iTunes.app\n\n\nA: OS X is checking for updates because of the receipt file, not because of the application. I'm pretty sure there's no easy way to delete the receipt for an app that's part of the OS. Back in the day, each app had its own receipt, but now I think they're stored in a database. If you look in /Library/Receipts, you'll see just non-OS apps.\nWhy does it bother you that iTunes is on your Mac? It's not getting in the way of anything. \n", "Q: Should I stop using my Mac while the hard disk is being cloned? As one of my backup solutions, I use an app (SuperDuper!, if it makes any difference) to make a clone of my Mac at the same time every evening. Sometimes I am still working at that time. What I want to know is: should I stop using my Mac while the clone is in progress? Why or why not? \nIntuitively it seems that if a file is being modified while it is being copied to the clone drive that could affect the integrity of the backup. However, it would be good to have a definitive answer from someone who knows.\nThanks for reading.\n\nA: I don't know if this applies to SuperDuper!, but here's a KB entry from Carbon Copy Cloner's website:\n\nCan I run a backup while I'm using my computer? If I have open files, will they be backed up?\nYes and no, it really depends. Performance will be affected during the clone (especially the first one) as CCC reads the entire source volume and writes to the destination volume. If your work is \"disk bound\" -- that is your applications are reading or writing to either the source or destination, then you'll notice a performance hit. If you're just reading email or writing a Pages document, then you probably won't notice the performance hit.\nAffecting the accuracy of the backup task is something else that should be considered. Typically it's OK to work from the source volume while you're copying it, with the understanding that if CCC copied a file, then you open it, make changes, save it, then CCC completes the backup task, the modified version of your document is not backed up (this time around). Typically that's no big deal, the modifications will get backed up the next time the backup task runs. More importantly, though, if you're working with large files (mounted disk image, Entourage email database, VMWare/Parallels container) during the backup operation, it is possible that those large files could be modified while CCC is backing up that file. This won't affect the source file, but there's a good chance that the backup version of that file will be corrupt. For this reason it is a good idea to stop using applications that may be modifying large files.\n\n\nA: Your instincts are correct.\nIf a file is being modified when the program reads it, you will end up with a copy of it in a transient state (or perhaps some programs like iPhoto that have a database that tracks files - the structure might not be correct to run with after a restore.)\nThis is why Time Machine makes two passes - it copies everything and then runs a second copy to pick up any files that were in the process of being modified during the first pass. Of course, a file under constant change might not get saved in either case, but it reduces the odds of a critically vital file that doesn't get changed often will be caught in a delicate moment.\nTo be safe, you want to boot to another OS (the recovery HD or an external drive) to run imaging if you need to ensure a perfect copy and all files being closed and flushed properly to storage.\n", "Q: know how many watts a USB device is consuming I know it's possible to do some electric hack to know how much current a device is using... but that would be a 1 time usage so it would be a waste of money and parts.\nIs it possible to know that using software in Mac OS?\nThere's no BIOS in Mac OS, but I presume through EFI the OS should be able to access that kind of low level info.\n\nA: System Information shows how much current devices tell they require at most:\n\nThe voltage for USB (including 2.0 and 3.0) is about 5 V, so 98 mA is about 0.49 W. For some devices the required current is just shown as 500 mA (the USB 2.0 maximum), and I don't know how to see how much energy devices actually consume.\n", "Q: How do I get into boot options with a non-mac keyboard? I boot my mac mini, hold down alt on my non-mac keyboard, but it does not go to boot options.\nHow do I get to boot options with a non-mac keyboard then?\n\nA: I had to plug in a wired USB keyboard.  Wireless Logitech K800 did not work in any ports.\n\nA: Things which seem to work:\n\n*\n\n*Mac mini late 2012: I had to plug the keyboard into the USB port closest to the middle, then it worked.\n\n*MacMini (mid-2010): the outside USB port worked for me with an ancient Microsoft intellitype keyboard.

The Mac App Store on Mac OS X (10.8.3) notifies me frequently about new app updates by showing a little popup.

The device sends data to the iCloud server, and the second device grabs this data from the same. The iCloud server is also responsible to keep the version history straight.\nSo if you want to sync data between an iOS and Mac OS device, you can do everything over Wifi in iTunes (Apps, in-App data, music, videos, calendar ...). You might also want to take a look at Files App for iOS. This app is a Mac OS Finder-like data management program that allows easy sync between iOS and Mac OS: it temporarily opens a network port and you can push data to the iOS device from your web browser without internet connection. \nAnd if you want to sync Data between two Mac OS devices (MacBooks or iMacs), you could simply use Dropbox's LAN Sync, which does not require a internet connection as long as both computers are connected to the same network. Depending on what you want to sync, you could simply but you data there, e.g., to sync you calendar, simply write and write the .ical file to Dropbox.\n\nA: or Air Drop. Apple's iOS 8.2 + OS X Yosemite allow for OTA transfer of files via bluetooth between the platforms. Earlier versions of iOS & OS X allow for  OS X <-> OS X or iOS <-> iOS. WiFi is not required. \n", "Q: Time Machine server with rotated disks I'm setting up a Time Machine server on my Linux box using netatalk. To provide redundancy, I want to periodically swap out the disk netatalk is using.\nAFAICT, from the perspective of the Macs, the identity of the server and volume won't change, but files will periodically appear and disappear. Will this confuse Time Machine on the client Macs?\n\nA: In all likelihood, yes. I haven't tested this exactly, but if Time Machine detects missing files, it may run into some problems, or have to re-backup a significant portion. Part of Time Machine's versioning relies on hard linking lots of files, so when previous versions it expects to see around aren't there, bad things could happen. It's a bit of an opaque system, so it's hard to say for sure, but it's best not to muck around with your backups.\nIf you want some redundancy (which is certainly a good idea for your backup system), I'd suggest one of two options. The first one is to simply set up two netatalk shares as Time Machine destinations. OS X can handle multiple Time Machine disks just fine, so you may as well take advantage of that feature. Just periodically rotate which share is online.\nThe second option is to clone the backup disk on the server end. You'd probably want to do some sort of check to make sure it's not being actively written to, but you should be able to do a simple rsync of the data (making sure that the proper options are there to preserve resource forks, etc.) and have a second copy of your backup.\n", "Q: Different keyboards layout I'm the owner of a MacBook Air I bought just a few days ago. I live in Italy, so for the sake of being able to sell the machine when its time will come, I bought it with an Italian keyboard layout.\nFor programming I'm trying to get used to US layout, I just wanted to know a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*what is the current US keyboard layout on Macs?

For example, compare the enter keys and the number of keys in each row.\nSo my (American) keyboard layout looks like this:\n\nWhat I noticed is that on your screenshot, the layout is called \"USA\", and on mine it is \"U.S.\", maybe this helps to find the correct layout.\n\nA: You're using the standard U.S. layout, but it seems to be called USA if the OS language is Italian.\nIn ISO keyboards the key next to the left shift outputs the key code used for backtick in the U.S. layout (50). ISO keyboards also have one more key. The extra keycode (10) outputs a section sign in the U.S. layout.\nYou can use KeyRemap4MacBook to move the backtick key and reassign the key next to shift:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::UK_SECTION, KeyCode::BACKQUOTE</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, KeyCode::F13</autogen>\n\n", "Q: Can an xbox360 be connected to a thunderbolt iMac to be used in target display mode I've attempted to do some research, but I've unable to determine if the imac can be used as a monitor (in target display mode) for my xbox 360.\nIt seems like the only option is some kind of weird converter like the ones that matrox produce for £150!

But you will get used to it.\nYou might need a larger cursor, that option can be found under Accessibility in System Preferences.\nAny other apps you want to have them look nicer, you will need to do it on a per-app basis, font size, zoom, etc.\nBut it won't be as good as the options under System Preferences, basically, if you have 2880x1800 as your resolution, and have everything 50% larger, that will be 1920x1200. So there's really no point to refuse it. Also Boot Camp defaults to 1800p with a 150% dpi.\nThe bottom line is, the options built-in are tweaked, you won't get anything better than those. Stick to it. As a fellow developer, I always choose 1200p or 1050p when doing UI designs. Go back to 900p when coding.\n", "Q: Wipe iphone, switch carriers, get new carrier-locked iphone, restore? Let's say I have an AT&T iphone 5. I regularly back it up with itunes.\nI decide to switch carriers to Verizon. I wipe my iphone, sell it, and get a brand new Verizon iphone 5.\nCan I simply plug that iphone into itunes, do a restore from backup, and have everything exactly as it was before? Or is there enough of a difference between the carrier-locked phones that this would not smoothly restore?\n\nA: You will be able to restore the backup, especially if your old device wasn't jailbroken (if it is, some space might end up wasted due to the unofficial apps' preferences & files).\nEven if you look to already expect this, remember the unlock won't carry over.\n", "Q: Use desktop as camera on Mountain Lion Hopefully this is not too difficult;\nI have an Elgato Game Capture HD, which I am using to capture an HDMI signal.

I would like to create an automation, that automatically sends a new file to my kindle email address if i put a new ebook into that folder.\nHow would a script look like, that i would have to apply to my folder?\n\nA: On the Mac You can use automator to set up a folder action for this. I added a filter for mobi files use this folder action directly with my Downloads folder. The Script consists of three actions:\nThe first action would be this applescript:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set theFile to first item in input\n    set theFileAsString to theFile as string\n    if theFileAsString ends with \"mobi\" then\n        return theFile\n    else\n        tell me to quit\n    end if\nend run\n\nSecond, you need a \"New Mail Message\" action with your name@kindle.com email address.

I am planning the next laptop and I really like the Macbook Air 13\" hardware, looks, and weight. On the other hand, for certain reasons I need Windows, so in case I stick with buying MBA13\" I am going to remove OSX and install W8 instead.\nOne of my biggest concerns here is whether W8 is fully compatible with MBA. I really would like all features work correctly - webcam, brightness/volume buttons, mic, cooling fan control, close/open lid, etc.\n\nA: Yes it is fully compatible. But since Windows 8 is heavily dependent on multi touch gestures, and the trackpad driver of a mac isn't the best... well its not recommended. I use bootcamp with Windows 8, but since Apple are the one who need to upgrade and update both the drivers and the bootcamp for almost every major Windows realise the experince might not be as good as a \"native\" pc, by this I mean you can get third party drivers, as I did, and it does work, but if you buy a Mac for the hardware I suggest you look at other alternatives as it doesn't function as well with Windows as it does with Mac!\nYou can get look alikes that perform better on Windows! I can say personally I buy Macs because of MAC OS X the hardware is only a plus, if I wasnt going to use Mac software i would probably look in to the Samsung Series 9. However the options are many, but if your main use is to buy a Mac in order to use Windows, I personally recommend you to look elsewhere, and if you are planning on partitioning your drive and only install Windows, well honestly you can get better hardware for less money. although probably uglier! (some exceptions)\n-this is from an avid mac and pc user-\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or need any assistance in future, please don't hesitate to reply to me. I'll be happy to assist you further.\nUpdate 1:\nWell except for the core i7 which can probably be configured in store, you can get most ultrabooks cheaper and update the ram and ssd yourself, I think my favorite pc-ultrabook (samsung series 9) is easy to upgrade yourself!\nhere are some links however\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2407200,00.asp\nhttp://www.theverge.com/products/aspire-s7-13-3-inch/5713\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2012/7/5/3135319/asus-zenbook-prime-ux31a-review\nhttp://www.engadget.com/2011/11/13/lenovo-ideapad-u300s-review/\nstill, go in to a store and try and feel them out, focus on the trackpad!

With bootcamp and/or Parallels. \n\nA: With the last bootcamp release Windows 8 is fully compatible with MBA 13 (Mid 2011 or newer)\nFor more information check this link:\nBoot Camp: Frequently asked questions about installing Windows 8\n\nA: The latest MacBook Air 13 is fully compatible with Windows 8. You can install Trackpad++ to enable all the multitouch gestures. \nThe only thing missing would be fast booting using EFI, i.e. your Windows 8 would boot in 45 seconds to one minute instead of 15 seconds, which is possible these days with Windows 8. \nOtherwise it works perfectly.\n", "Q: Can I recover a deleted video from the iPhone 4S camera roll? So I blundered this morning. Had a cute video of my daughter on Easter, then I accidentally deleted when I was trying to show people (its amazing how a simple finger swipe can cause so much damage!). \nSadly, I didn't not do any sync to iTunes after this files was created, so no luck on that kind of backup.\nSo now I'm looking some type of file recovery software for an iPhone 4S. I've tried Tenorshare, Wunderphone, and a few others that have popped up on my Google searches (I'm really grateful for virtual machines for testing these out!). \nThese have not done me any good. Any ideas on what may be out there?\n\nA: If it is jailbroken and you have OpenSSH installed, you might be able to pipe a whole disk image to your computer, on which you will be able to try standard HFS+ file recovery software.\nIf you don't meet the above requirements, keep in mind all disk activity - especially that involved in the jailbreaking process, but even that which could have happened in the meantime by normal use, has the very potential of contributing to the overwriting of the affected files.\n", "Q: Restoring data from iPad to new Mac after old Mac died My wife's Mac died.  We sent the hard drive to a data recovery service, but the platters are damaged beyond repair or recovery, nor do we have a usable backup.  Now she has a new Mac.\nHer iPad 1 (iOS 5.1.1) still has important data on it, for example audio and video that she worked hard to create herself (as opposed to purchasing it from the iTunes store).  In many cases the only remaining copies of this audio or video are trapped on this iPad.\nMy vague understanding is that if we were to connect the iPad to the new Mac, iTunes would permanently delete all of this data.\nIs there any safe, foolproof, credible way to copy non-purchased audio and video from the iPad to the new Mac, without accidentally destroying it in the process?\nIt would be nice to get purchased music and apps back too, ideally without having to locate and pay for everything again, but the irreplaceable original content is the more immediate concern here.\nAlthough I consider myself to be fairly tech-savvy in general and I've used a Mac for years, unfortunately I'm not at all familiar with the iPad or even with iTunes -- basically I have zero experience or knowledge of either of those things.  We don't have access to another identical iPad to play with, and I'm extremely reluctant to experiment now and possibly destroy this important data.\n\nA: Your personal, i.e. non-purchased, media can be copied from your iOS device using Macroplant's iExplorer.\nIf you could mount the iOS device's filesystem directly, you could find your media in Media/iTunes_Control/iTunes—if you had a Linux system handy, for example; I don't know of a way to do this directly on OS X.  The files stored in that area are renamed seemingly randomly, but should be able to be imported into iTunes since their media tags should be intact.\n\nA: Hi you should try this iflash drive which allows transfer from ipad to mac via bluetooth https://itunes.apple.com/fr/artist/salecalc-software/id307563356\n", "Q: Speech Commands with Eclipse I'm running Mac OS X 10.7.5 on my MacBook Pro and love the Voice Commands / Speakable Items feature.\nI also have a lot of custom commands that I use by writing applescripts and putting them in either ~/Library/Speech/Speakable Items or ~/Library/Speech/Speakable Items/Application Speakable Items/myApplication. This has worked well for me so far.\nHowever, this does not seem to work when I created a directory in Application Speakable Items called Eclipse for using speech commands with my eclipse IDE. I even tried using the Make this speakable command while using eclipse, but that doesn't seem to work either.\nThe only thing I can think of now is to put all of eclipse's commands into Speakable Items and call them from there, but that is not a very elegant solution.\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on what I can do?\n\nA: In my experience, using Speakable Items for the rather, shall we say, complicated applications can get a bit tricky - but there's no reason it's not possible. Usually, if you use the \"Make This Speakable\" command whilst an application is in focus (i.e is your foreground app), a folder will be created for it in Application Speakable Items if it does not already exist. \nAs OS X is UNIX-based, my initial idea was to call the folder eclipse, as the executable that the system sees (not the .app bundle itself) is actually called eclipse as opposed to Eclipse. \nHowever, should that not work, Apple's official advice is to simply drag the folder to your desktop and then attempt to use the \"Make This Speakable\" command whilst using (in this case) Eclipse so that the computer will (or at least should) create the folder for you - at which point you can simply drag all the AppleScripts you have made into the newly-created folder.\nFrom a programming / behind-the-scenes point of view, though, the answer may well hinge on what version of Java you are using! Should you be using Apple's own Java implementation, you will likely run into more problems than using the latest Java 7 release. \nEclipse uses the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), which wraps native controls (or more accurately, makes Java communicate with OS X like it would with, say, other *nix) so by those standards alone ought to already be accessible. I know that NetBeans is mostly, if not entirely accessible at least from a VoiceOver standpoint. \nBrowsing Eclipse's documentation and bug history reveals discussion of this back in 2007, and seems to suggest they were working on it in 2008, but there's no mention of having Eclipse controlled with AppleScript voice commands. It ought to be straightforward and simple, so if it seems like Eclipse and/or OS X is resisting every attempt to communicate with Java or the IDE itself via AppleScript(s), I'd be inclined to believe it's some quirk with Eclipse or its communication with the SpeechWorker and the rest of OS X.\n", "Q: Viber messenger not working on my ad-hoc wireless network I have an iPhone 5 (iOS 6.1.1) and I installed Viber messenger (version 2.2.2.86) which enables you to make phone calls over the internet. The messenger works perfectly when I use a wireless router to connect to the internet (which I don't have at home) but when I connect to my Windows XP ad-hoc network, I can't make phone calls. the call is dropped after 3 to 4 seconds and I can't receive calls either. This only happens on my ad-hoc network.\n\n\n*\n\n*The computer connects to the internet through 3G modem\n\n*I tried updating to the latest version of Viber (2.3.1) from apple but no good\n\n*My friend has an older iPhone (probably 3G or 4) and he has the same exact version of Viber. When he tries to use my ad-hoc network, it works and he can call and receive calls.\n\n*I can't use my 3G sim card directly on my iPhone, I have to go through the ad-hoc network.\n\n\nWhat could be the problem and solution to this dilemma?\n\nA: Because your friends iDevice works, it may make this consideration useless. http://www.viberfaq.com/why-cant-i-use-viber-on-some-wi-fi-networks/ suggests that these ports are required for Viber to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*TCP: 5242 and 4244\n\n*UDP: 5243 and 7985 (9785) (7985 is the port specified on the Viber) troubleshooter\n\n\nHowever, the symptoms of having closed ports would be no connection to Viber.

Are OS X systems with manually set, complex (128 character), root passwords more, or less, secure than the vanilla system freshly installed?\n\nA: Enabling the root user decreases security.\nApple turns it off by default which means that someone trying to perform a remote log in both has to guess an admin user name and the password. It's not a huge decrease in security, since all admin users can become root knowing an admin password, but by enabling root, you have either doubled the exposure (the first account on a Mac has to be an Admin account and the root doubles the exposure) or if you have several Admin accounts, it increases the number by one.\nSince it only takes one password to be guessed or \"stolen\" - having fewer openings is a more secure stance from a numbers and chance standpoint.\n", "Q: How to add Outlook to \"Share\" popup menu in finder Unfortunately I have an old habit to have the \"send by email\" when right click on a file in the Share option pop up window.\nI would prefer to use the Outlook so I can email the selected file.\nRight now it comes up with Twitter, Facebook, Messages, AirDrop and even with Flicker (that I do not have).\nIs that option available on my MBA osx 10.8.3 ?\n\nA: Automator services lets you add a new service to accomplish this.\nSee my screen capture for specific details how easy this is showing my first time using Automator.\n\nImportant is to select your email service of your choice (gmail in my case) to send messages and attachments.\nThat will tell the OS X Mail client to use that service to send emails.\nSave your Automator service file (give it a easy name you want to appear in the Finders right click popup window).

I bought a second hand iPhone 3GS which is locked to AT&T's network, I want to unlock it for use in the UK. I'm on the Redmond Pie site which can unlock and jailbreak it, but I don't know what version of iOS the phone is running. I can't figure this out either because opening Settings crashes.\n\nA: I would check the serial number (printed on the box or/if it wasn't replaced, behind the SIM tray/by entering DFU mode and checking in System Profiler or using the Identify feature in redsn0w) and, if it is old enough to downgrade its baseband, restore it to the iOS version you'll want to use° and perform the jailbreak+iPad baseband and baseband downgrade procedures.\n°depending on available SHSH, of course\nSeeing the poor condition of the existing system software you'll likely want to restore it anyway…\n\nA: You can ask your service provider to unlock your Iphone 3GS. \n", "Q: Permissions looking for unknown user I have a problem on a external drive which permissions are looking for an unknown user.

Is there anything I can do in the terminal?\n\nA: If you browse to one of the external disks' folders in the Terminal, typing ls -l will show you the owner and group as the third and fourth columns.\nIf these are just numeric IDs, your system doesn't know who the owning user is, and is printing a raw UID/GID instead.\n", "Q: Can a magnetic case harm my iPhone? I am thinking about buying a magnetic iPhone 4S case but I'm not sure whether it's safe. Can this magnetic case be harmful for the inner parts of my iPhone 4S? The case looks exactly like this:\n\n\nA: The storage on a 4S is Flash-based, not magnetic-media-based, which would be my prime concern in a scenario like this—so you're safe there.  I'm not aware of any other components in the 4S that would be affected by a magnetic case.

I had about 2.4 TB of data in the initial pass of the backup with TM.  It took about 9 hours to complete.  I'm not sure the initial estimate is accurate, but it does take a very long time on the initial pass.  Once that is done though, the incremental updates are very quick.  \nI think in this case you just have to be patient, and don't pay too much attention to the estimate of completion time.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine fail gracefully if I eject the backup disk during a backup? I'm using an external USB HDD as my Time Machine backup disk for my MacBook. I have it plugged in as long as I'm working at my desk. I don't have it with me when I take the laptop somewhere else. However, I'm afraid that at some point I'm going to need to go to a meeting or something that requires me to bring my laptop, which means I'll have to unplug my backup disk. What if I can't wait for it to finish because a client is here? Time is money, you know!\nMy question for you is whether Time Machine fails gracefully if I do this while a backup is running. And I'm not talking unsafe unplugging; I would use the \"eject\" function.\nNormally, I would try something like this myself, but a lot is at stake here if it fails!\n\nA: In your assumption of properly ejecting the drive first, there'll be no issues: the partial backup will even be kept so that files which were already copied during this partial backup and you didn't change in the meanwhile won't have to be copied again.\n\n\nA: I have \"demonstrated\" this in a variety of ways including accidentally removing the disk during a Time Machine backup, closing the laptop during a Time Machine backup, and just plain powering off the system during a Time Machine backup (don't ask) ... and in all cases, Time Machine moaned about it but gracefully picked up where it left off.\n", "Q: iPad adjusts brightness when it reaches full charge I recently put some iPads up around my office building as conferance room markers.  They're plugged in to USB outlets, and seem to be charging fine.  The screen stays on all the time, running Eventboard Pro.  \nThe problem is that in order to keep the battery from running down while plugged in, I adjust the screen brightness to around 75%.  But, whenever I come back to them later in the day, they brightness slider is back at 100%, causing the battery to drain.  Usually when I arrive in the morning I have to go around the building, manually turning on and lowering the brightness.  Autobrightness is turned off on all of them, and I'm pretty sure the outlets are fine, as it charges during the day with lowered brightness.\nIs this auto-adjustment in brightness a known issue, or is there some hidden setting I'm missing?  The iPads are all updated to the most recent iOS as of April 1st, and it's a mix of iPad 2s and New iPads.\nIf I need to provide any other information, I'll be happy to do so.  Thanks for looking!\n\nA: First, to directly answer your question, no, there is no hidden setting that is causing your brightness to increase without your input. The only to settings related to brightness as of iOS 6 is Auto-Brightness (which you have disabled), and the brightness slider. As far as I'm concerned, it must be a bug.\nSo it looks like you have a few sub-par options. \n\n\n*\n\n*USB outlets are really nice, but in the long run, they may not be a good solution for you. Even though the original power supply bricks that come with iPad, stick out of the wall, and can be in the way, they do supply enough energy to keep the iPad charged, and even charging despite high battery consumption at the same time. \n\n*Bring one home to see if you can replicate the problem with original charging apparatus. If this is the case, you may consider scheduling an appointment, and taking it to one of Apple's Genius bars. Perhaps they are aware of a bug or will have an idea as to what is going on. \nOne side note, I have seen extremely strange behavior when an iOS device is given \"bad\" power. If the USB outlets are questionable quality, there is a far-out chance this is causing it. That said, most of the behavior I have seen from \"bad\" power comes from touch screen activity, and this would mean that each device was used in between times that you checked on it.\nEither way, my recommendation would be to use the included chargers with your iPad if that is at all possible.\n", "Q: macbook air mail: how to configure HELO sent to smtp server? Hello I am trying to set up a mail account on a new macbook air (Lion 10.7.5 Build 11G63B). I have gone through all the steps but it will not connect to the smtp server. I am using straight SMTP (not SSL) with a username and password that I have verified are correct.\nThe connection doctor shows that the connection is being rejected due to the HELO that is sent to it:\nHELO mymac.mydomain\\.co\\.uk\n501 HELO requires valid address\n\nI have reproduced the above error with a telnet to the SMTP server. With mymac.mydomain\\.co\\.uk I get the above error. With mymac.mydomain.co.uk it authenticates correctly.\nHow do I stop the macbook sending a garlbed HELO ?\n\nFurther detail on the SMTP setup. I have set the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Description\n\n*Server Name = the fqdn of the smtp server (definately correct)\n\n*Use custom Port 25 (only while trying to get it to work - I expect the 'use default ports' option would be ok)\n\n*Use SSL is unchecked (don't use SSL)\n\n*Username set to known correct username\n\n*Password set to known correct password\n\n\nThere are no other settings available. The smtp bit of this site: http://www.plus.net/support/email/setup/mail-107-smtp.shtml reflects what I was doing.\n\nA: (I apologize in advance for the wishy-washiness of this answer, but while I hope I'm on the right track, I do have some gaps in my knowledge.)\nThe SMTP HELO message, while something of a relic, is supposed to allow the client to identify itself to a server.  It is still required for the protocol and is generally expected to at least be a syntactically valid hostname (which yours is not.)  Your SMTP server appears to be complaining because it is indeed invalid.\nMail uses the name of your Mac, or the hostname assigned by the DHCP server on your network.  DHCP servers don't always assign a hostname.  OS X prefers a DHCP assigned hostname over using the computer's name as the hostname.\nBased on this, the first place I'd look is my network configuration.  I wonder, if you opened a terminal and typed hostname -f, what would you get?  Possibly\n$ hostname -f\nmymac.mydomain\\.co\\.uk\n\nIf you do get this, the next step is to identify where it's coming from.  A likely source could be a misconfigured DHCP server.  You can try\n$ sudo hostname mymac.mydomain.co.uk\n\nto temporarily change the hostname for testing, or\n$ sudo scutil --set HostName mymac.mydomain.co.uk\n\nto set it permanently.\n\nA: There are several good resources available on how to set up mail accounts in OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Mail Setup Assistant\n\n*Mac Basics -- Mail\n\n*Mail Basics (Video)\nIf you are using an non-iCloud mail account, there is no need to even configure iCloud settings for getting it to work with an ISP.\n", "Q: Play audio CLI apps I have an AppleScript which plays audio files using Play (from hieper.nl) unix cli app.\nI would like to find a command line play program with which I can set the volume without touching system output volume. EyeTV has its own volume setting and it's nice to change the volume of EyeTV without changing system volume.\nIt would be nice if I could pause playing and quit it some other way than using kill.\n\nA: afplay might do what you need. It's a built-in utility, so no need to download or build anything.\nIt's fairly basic, but it does include volume control independent of the system volume.\nTo play a file, simply run afplay somefile.mp3. To alter the volume, you can use the -v switch, followed by a number (in my testing, the range seems to go from 0-2, with 1 being normal volume). So afplay anotherfile.m4a -v 0.5 would play at half the normal volume.\nPlayback control can be done with some basic Unix signalling to afplay:\nkill -17 <pid> # pause playback\nkill -19 <pid> # resume playback\n\nThere are also a few other options you can see by running afplay -h.\n", "Q: set remote sharing prefs in terminal I am admin for department and I want to batch change the \"show remote management status in menu bar\" so that I don't have to log in to each machine and set it.\nI have ARD so I can run a terminal command across all machines I just can't seem to find out how to set that option through the terminal \nCould anyone tell me how to do that ? or if it's even possible ?\n\nA: The easiest tool to set these settings programatically is the kickstart script that Apple ships:\n\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -help\n\nDo read the help since, it warns This script can be used to grant very permissive incoming access permissions.

I'm trying to use afconvert to convert an audio file to AC-3 format. It's 5.1 audio, having already been converted from DTS to WAV (using ffmpeg, since afconvert doesn't seem to deal with DTS).\nAs you can see, I've tried various parameter incantations, including trying to use a different container formats, but with no success:\n$ afconvert -f ac-3 test.wav \nError: ExtAudioFileCreateWithURL failed ('typ?')\n$ afconvert -f ac-3 -d ac-3 test.wav \nError: ExtAudioFileCreateWithURL failed ('typ?')\n$ afconvert -f caff -d AC-3 test.wav \nError: ExtAudioFileSetProperty ('cfmt') failed ('fmt?')\n\nI have been able to encode it to an AAC file successfully, so it's presumably something with the AC-3 encoding, but Googling those errors yields no results. Does anyone know how to properly convert to AC-3 with afconvert?\nIf you want to do some testing yourself, I found some free 5.1 DTS sample files here. Note that while the file extension is .wav, they're actually DTS files, not WAV. To replicate my desired workflow, decode to a WAV file with ffmpeg: ffmpeg -i input.wav -acodec pcm_s16le -f wav output.wav, then you'll have a proper 5.1 WAV file afconvert should be able to work with.\n\nA: Can't you use ffmpeg? This seemed to work for the DTS WAV files here:\nffmpeg -i test.wav -ab 640k test.ac3\n\n\nA: EDIT: Deleted original answer as it did not pertain.\nDid an alternate test on my box, mainly to generate a file that would allow me to test afconvert, but came up with another solution to generate an AC3 file, which does not use ffmpeg:\nSo, starting with a mono 44100 wav file, I used 'sox' to merge multiple wav files into a multiple channel wav: surround.wav which I then used 'aften' to convert to an AC3 encoded file:\n$ file surround.wav \nsurround.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, 5 channels 44100 Hz\n\n$ aften -b 448 -cmix 0 -smix 0 -dsur 2 -acmod 7 surround.wav surround.ac3\n\n\n$ file surround.ac3 \nsurround.ac3: ATSC A/52 aka AC-3 aka Dolby Digital stream, 44.1 kHz,, complete main (CM) 3 front/2 rear, LFE on,, 448 kbit/s not Dolby Surround encoded\n\n(src: http://parumi.wordpress.com/2007/12/12/how-to-create-multichannel-51-ac3-audio-and-video-in-linux/ )\nStill working on why afconvert won't honor or work with the ac-3 format. \n", "Q: Internal layout of the iPad3 If you hold an iPad3 vertically, portrait, with the Apple logo right way up, which end is at the top?  the batteries or the main board?\n\nA: As you can see from one of iFixit's repair guides, in portrait orientation with the home button at the bottom, the logic board is on the left side of the iPad, with the battery on the right.\n\n", "Q: Run script on networked user login The computer lab is running 10.8. I would like to run a script when networked users login. As far as I can tell my choices are:\nlaunchd agents - Not meant for this. On the launchd.plist man page it says \"An agent launched by launchd SHOULD NOT do the following as a part of their startup initialization: Setup the working directory.\" That's basically what my script does. \nlogin items - A number of posts indicate that they worked in 10.7 but don't work in 10.8\nlogin hooks - This works but the \"Customizing Login and Logout\" on developer.apple.com says \"There are numerous reasons to avoid using login and logout scripts: Login and logout scripts are a deprecated technology.\"\nI don't want to use something that won't work tomorrow. I would like to do this the \"right way\" if there is one. Please advise. Thanks.\n\nA: Setting the Working Directory for a Script\nYou should use a launchd agent job placed in the /Library/LaunchAgents folder.\nThe advice you mention, quoted below, is aimed at the executable or script being launched. You should let launchd manage the working directory for you.\n\nA daemon or agent launched by launchd SHOULD NOT do the following as a part of their startup initialization:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Setup the user ID or group ID.\n  \n*Setup the working directory.\n  \n*chroot(2)\n  \n*setsid(2)\n  \n*Close \"stray\" file descriptors.\n  \n*Change stdio(3) to /dev/null.\n  \n*Setup resource limits with setrusage(2).\n  \n*Setup priority with setpriority(2).\n  \n*Ignore the SIGTERM signal.\n  \n\nThe launchd job ticket is responsible for requesting the desired working directory; use the WorkingDirectory key to set the directory. The directory will be automatically set before your executable or script is launched.\nA full description of the available keys in a launchd job ticket are available in the  launchd.plist(5) manual page.\nSetting the Working Directory for the User\nConsider providing a modified ~/.bashrc or other shell login script to provide a known current working directly.\n", "Q: How to \"not reject\" an incoming call during do not disturb? The Do Not Disturb feature in iOS 6 is great but i really dont like the part where it rejects the incoming call. Is it possible to just let it ring (without notification or sound)?\nIs there a tweak in cydia that can change the way Do Not Disturb behaves? I have suspended using this feature because many people confuse this with me not wanting to pick up their call (rejecting).\n\nA: No jailbreak needed, just set the option found in Preferences/Notifications/Do Not Disturb/Allow calls from to Everyone.\n\nA: You can already silence incoming calls without rejecting them by turning on the Mute switch on the side of your iPhone. Then go into Settings → Sounds & Haptics and Disable Vibrate on Silent.\nYou can combine this with Do Not Disturb by allowing calls from Everyone under Settings → Do Not Disturb.\nYou will still get the Incoming Call screen, as the only way to make it go away is to either accept or reject the call (from a UI perspective, there’s no reason to have a call ring that you cannot accept). However if you’re not using your iPhone at that time then this achieves your purpose of letting your callers go to voicemail “naturally,” rather than after one ring.\n", "Q: Why does Mountain Lion keep using the wrong screen saver? I have my screen saver set to Arabesque. If I move my mouse down to the Screen Saver hot corner, I get Arabesque. If I sit and wait for the screen saver to start automatically, I get Arabesque.\nBut if I leave my computer for any length of time and come back to it, it's almost always on Message, putting the name of my Mac up for everyone to see. I dislike this behavior. If I go to System Preferences after this happens, it's still on Arabesque, it's just ignoring the setting.\nWhat's going on? Is there any way to fix it?\n\nA: If your computer is locked, the screensaver settings for the root user account is used instead of your own. You can change those settings according to the answer to this question: How can I set the Mac OS X screensaver when not logged in?\n\nA: \"Almost\" always?

I'm trying to recover data from a failed external Fantom RAID Drive enclosure by plugging the drives into a Mac Pro tower, but I'm concerned that OS X might write to the disks and jeopardize the RAID structure.\nI believe that the disks are RAID 0, but I am not sure. Also, I am pretty sure that the problem is with the RAID enclosure and not the drives themselves.\nHow can I mount the drives as read-only to avoid any corruption?\n\nA: I use a program called Disk Arbitrator. Its used to block auto-mounts when you connect devices and can also be used to auto mount drives in read-only instead of read.\n\n(Disk Arbitrator is the green icon, far left)\nFrom my understanding it hops in before the system can mount the drive, and instead mounts as read-only. Probably not as good as using a hardware block, but in most cases its sufficient (and I rely on it for similar purposes)\n", "Q: How to trim many files using adobe photoshop I have 300 png files. I want to trim each of them. But for this I need open each file and make changes (even if I make script for trimming and save it will be long to open each file and do trimming). Is there already made solution or some advice how to do it better and quickly.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Another option using ImageMagick:\nmogrify -trim *.png\n\nYou can install it with brew install imagemagick after installing Homebrew.\n\nA: Photoshop is a terrific software and ultimately is designed to save the end user time. So, since you are the owner of (or have access to) a license of PS, you have the right tool at your fingertips. I am going to assume you have the full version of Photoshop, not Elements. If you do have PS Elements, things may work differently, or not at all for you.\nPreface: this should take you less then 10 minutes to take care of all 300 images, if it is just a matter of trimming them all. It may take you longer, however, since this is likely a first for you. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure all the images are in one folder.\n\n*Open one of the images.\n\n*Turn on the Actions Palette. (Window -> Actions).\n\n*Create a new folder under Actions palette.\n\n*Create a new action under your folder.\n\n*It automatically starts recording.\n\n*Trim the photo, and perform any procedures you normally do on the photo. \n\n*\n\n*If you do any layer work, or other work that is more or less custom to each image during this process, things can get a little more tricky. Use keyboard shortcuts such as alt + [ and alt + ] to move between layers and make sure the right layer is selected. During this time, think automation. Try to think that every thing you do is being performed on 300 photos. PS doesn't record mouse clicks, it records actions, so simply clicking a layer may not have good results. You may want to create a folder in Finder which you can experiment with so you don't ruin any photos. \n\n*If it is as simple as running the Trim command, you are on easy terrain. \n\n\n*After that photo is set, go ahead and save it like you would. This part doesn't matter a whole lot, but is a good step none-the-less.\n\n*Now the fun part -- go to File -> Automate -> Batch, and choose the Actions folder that you created a moment ago.\n\n*\n\n*Select your source and destination folders (should be different).\n\n*Override \"Open\" commands, and \"Save As\" actions.\n\n\n*Click ok, and have some coffee.\n\n\nIt really is a very easy process, especially after you get the hang of it. There is a lot of information on Google about automating things in Photoshop, also.\n\nA: Here is step by step guide inspired from bassplayer7\nHow to trim multiple images in Photoshop http://tech-with-us.blogspot.com/2016/12/how-to-trim-multiple-images-in-photoshop.html\n", "Q: How to find specific IP address within LAN?

It is the only device giving out IP addresses, and the switches (including the time-capsule) just redirect the traffic (i.e. bridge mode), right?\nIf I am not mistaking, the client list in your router should provide you with the list of all connected devices with mac-addresses and ip-addresses (and sometimes device names). Try and see if the mac address of your device is in there.\n\nA: Ok, this will teach me not to fiddle around at 2:00 am with a sleepy head.\nIt turned out I had the device plugged-in on the time-capsule (explaining the 10.0.1.152 address) \nWith me changing the whole setup as it needs to be....

I try the root password and it doesn't work.\nIf I type sudo su postgres, I'm prompted for my root password, which I enter, and that works.\nBut now, if I try to switch back to the default user using sudo su user, I'm prompted for a password, and the root password does not work.  Neither does the password I use to log into that user in OSX.\nI don't understand what's going on here--I've only ever set one password, but the only context in which it seems to work is when switching from the normal user to 'postgres'.  What's going on and how can I fix it?\n\nA: *\n\n*To switch to user postgres, type in Terminal:\nsudo su - postgres\n\nIf you are asked for a password, type yours.\n(The - in sudo su - changes the environment to that of the new user, and it's probably what you want. See man su for details.)\n\n*Now, to switch back to your user, simply type:\nexit\n\nto exit the current bash session and go back to your original bash session.\nNote that if you type sudo su <user> as user postgres you need to identify yourself to sudo and type postgres's password, but as you say, it hasn't any, so it won't work. It may even be the case that user postgres is not allowed to use sudo at all.\n\nA: I think you are mixing several concepts here which leads to some confusion.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo required the password of the current user for authorization. So if you run it as yourself, enter your own password. If you run it as postgres (e.g. after having switched to that user), the password of the postgres user would be required. As this is most probably not set (and postgres isn't included in /etc/sudoers either), postgres won't be able run sudo\n\n*In the way you use it, sudo creates a new shell running with the new user. To switch back to the previous user, just exit the shell (Ctrl-D)\n\n*Instead of using sudo su <username> it might be easier to skip the su part and just use sudo -su <username> (or just sudo -s if you want to become root)\n\n\nIn practice I found it much easier to open several tabs in Terminal and log into different users in each tab. This way you don't have to worry about switching back and forth all the time.\n\nFrom sudo(8):\n\nIf the invoking user is root or if the target user is the same as the\n         invoking user, no password is required.  Otherwise, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves\n         with a password by default (NOTE: in the default configuration this is the user's password, not the\n         root password).  Once a user has been authenticated, a time stamp is updated and the user may then\n         use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden in sudoers)\n\n", "Q: Can't switch iMessages on I can't switch iMessages ON anymore (it was ON).\nWhen I try to flip the switch from OFF to ON it instantly returns to OFF (I don't see any message like \"activating...\", it just doens't flip).

How can I move it to the external hard drive without any trouble (e.g., loosing rights to watch it \"you are not allowed to watch this movie due to DRS\" etc.)? For mp3 I locate it on my internal hard drive, copy it to the Desktop, delete it from the iTunes library and import it again. Can I do that for bought movies as well?\n\nA: There's an easier solution to this than re-importing, and it works for both movies and songs (and probably everything else, but I haven't had reason to try it on any other media type).  \nIn iTunes, go to the File menu, then select Library, and then Organize Library.  On the resulting dialog, check \"Consolidate files\".  When you hit OK, any files that have somehow gotten stored in the wrong place will move back to where they belong on your external drive.  \nAfter this has completed (it might take a couple of minutes, since I'm assuming that a movie file is big), you can test it out.  Command-click on your movie and select \"get info\", and then look at its file location on the General tab.  Its file location should show that it's on the external hard drive.  Then you can try to play it.  If it plays successfully, you can then delete it from your internal hard drive.\n", "Q: File transfer from XBOX 360 to MBA (wifi?)

(Private hotspot from external wifi connection) While travelling, it would be convenient to set up a wifi hotspot from my Macbook, which would share the wifi internet with my phone and tablet (wifi <-> Macbook <-> wifi). This would make it easy to test apps I'm developing on the Macbook and also make it easier to connect devices to the internet, instead of making each of them jump through the considerable hoops of public wifi providers.\nThere's no ethernet involved, just a public/hotel wifi connection. I realise this isn't possible with just the built-in wifi; it needs some kind of external wifi device. My question is firstly to confirm this is possible, and secondly to ask exactly what setup (hardware and config) is required.\n\nA: It isn't directly possible without a USB card. The Macbook (Pro) can only do one thing with it's built-in wireless card. It can either be on the receiving end of the wifi connection or the sending.\nYou do have several good options here, though. If you were satisfied with dealing with cords some, you could consider sharing your internet connection over \"iPhone USB\". I don't know if that would work for two devices simultaneously, however.\nYou can check out the sharing options under System Preferences -> Sharing -> Internet Sharing. \nThe better option, and the one you mentioned is to get a USB wireless adapter (perhaps something similar to this, but I'm sure there are other better ones as that is just b/g, and you would probably like n), and then share that internet connection by creating an ad-hoc network.\nYou will need to connect your USB adapter, and then open System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing. (From this Apple Forum post) Select USB from the drop down menu next to \"Share your connection from:\". Then select the \"Wifi\" from the checkboxes below. Check the Internet Sharing option to the left, then join it with your iPhone and iPad.\nHere is an Apple KB support article that you may find helpful in setting up an ad-hoc network. While you are using USB the steps in this OSX Daily article should be very similar to your situation.\n\nA: WiFi to WiFi cannot be done as far as I have seen (I would be curious to know why, as it seems Macs are capable of this on the hardware side), but you can combine WiFi and Bluetooth for a similar effect:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing.\n\n*Share from WiFi to Bluetooth PAN.\n\n\nYou can now receive a weak WiFi signal with your Mac and hook your iPad, etc. up to the internet via Bluetooth.\n\nA: you can also share the internet connection via Bluetooth...

I can use the preset FCPX YouTube uploader to do it, but I can't adjust the QuickTime settings from within FCPX. I can also set custom QuickTime settings in Compressor and upload to YouTube from Compressor.  However, when I try to use those Compressor settings in FCPX, I only get the option to save to disk, not upload to YouTube.\nIs there a way to use Compressor through FCPX to upload directly to YouTube?\np.s. The reason I want to do this is because I am teaching a class and want to upload large (2.5hr) videos to YouTube.  I have a very slow Internet connection, and I'd like to get the process started when I go to bed so that (hopefully) the videos will be uploaded by the next morning when I leave for work.  Final Cut Pro X has the ability to upload directly to YouTube (after all the rendering), but there aren't any custom options for the YouTube upload, and the videos it creates are 4.5GB, taking 10+ hours to upload.  Compressor will make the videos smaller, but unless I can figure out how to do all of the processing and uploading in one shot, I'll have to get up in the middle of the night to do the manual switch.  I'd rather avoid that!\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. NOTE: Compressor cannot process directly to YouTube, it must first render to the HD, then upload to YouTube. The uploading is automatic if you set it up correctly.\nCreate your movie in Final Cut X and send to Compressor as usual. This creates a default batch named New Project. In the Settings window, drag the settings for the video you need (there are 7 to choose from) from the HTTP Live Streaming folder into the batch, then drag to a Destination you've created your HD. Once the destination has been chosen, select the New Project batch and choose the Job Action tab in the Inspector window. One of the \"When job completes:\" actions in Inspector is Publish to YouTube. You enter authentication credentials and define Title, Description, Tags, Category, etc, right from the inspector.\n\n", "Q: How does an iOS device keep time when it is out of power? My iPhone is always running out of battery.  However, when I power it back up, the time is still in perfect synchronization.  This begs the question: \"How does it keep time when it is out of battery?\"\nThere must be some sort of 'ticking' mechanism in the phone while it is out of battery and, thus, not entirely out of battery.\n\nA: The iPhone is not completely depleted when the battery \"dies.\"  If you'll notice, when you try to turn it on when the battery is dead, the screen will come on briefly to tell you the battery is dead -- i.e., there is still some energy left in the battery.  The clock continues to run off of the battery, and takes such a small amount of energy that Apple decided to keep the clock going.\nEventually, the battery will completely die (probably after many days or weeks), and the clock will eventually stop keeping time.  As Ian C. mentioned, the clock will synchronize when the phone does get plugged in and turned on again, if a network is available.\n\nA: It's better to ask how computers take time?\nUsually they have another power source to run the timer circuit. I think in the apple devices it is not the main battery. As I remember in my desktop PC besides AC power, a simple battery holds the time for 5 or 6 years. (I remember we should take out that battery to reset BIOS password!). So I think there most be some other energy sources like a small battery to keep your time and passwords. \n\nA: The phone synchronizes its clock with your wireless provider's embedded clock signal when it starts up. All cellular protocols provide for a clock network feature that lets devices on the network synchronize their time and date with a master time and date from the provider.\nSo it isn't that the phone kept time while it was out of power, it was that it set the correct date and time when started up.\n\nA: The Real Time Clock is a component independent of the primary CPU (although it's all part of the same SOC IC) which will continue running from a lower voltage than is required to run any other part of the phone. As a phone's battery is depleted its voltage decreases, and below a certain voltage some components will fail to function at all. It may be depleted so far that it would be considered permanently damaged and un-rechargeable and it would still have enough voltage to run the RTC.\n\nA: A laptop does it with a CMOS Battery. So, Apple probably put something small like that inside the iPhone. Actually, Persistent Storage is another point to consider. For Example, I had an HP Pocket PC Phone that would Delete all the Data when the Battery Died. (You can see now why we all use Apple Products.) And finally, remember that Cell Phones (and Computers) can get Time Over-the-Air (Network) and Internet.\n\nA: Although it is an old thread and a lot of good answers have already been given, I would like to add a point no one mentioned so far. If you switch your phone to airplane mode and the battery is running out of power below the minimal level required for the RTC (Real Time Clock) to run, or even better if you disconnect the battery, once you turn back the phone on, date and time will not be able to synchronize (because it would still be on airplane mode obviously) and you will notice date and time will be set to a moment in time just before the phone ran out of power (maybe 1 or 2 minutes before). That is the reason why I would be inclined to think current date and time are written periodically in flash memory.\n", "Q: Multiple logitech keyboards with different keymaps?

I've tried disconnecting the device from any network before trying to change it... and nothing changes.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This happens when you're using the generic Apple-supplied driver for the USB WiFi device, or if you're using a vendor-supplied driver that doesn't support changing the MAC address.\nYou'll need to install the vendor-supplied driver for your adapter, if you haven't already. If you cannot find a driver for your specific product, you might be able to find a driver for a different product using the same WiFi chipset - that might work.\nWhen you have the vendor-supplied driver installed, the command you have supplied could then be able to change the MAC address.\n", "Q: Quicktime records a green screen When I record a screen with a standard QuickTime Player functionality, I get a completely green video.

Regarding screen ratio: If I see correctly, both Applications will not change the aspect ratio of the PDF when in presentation mode (e.g. for square PDFs)\n\nA: I'm going to answer my own question a few seconds after I first asked it.\nThe first issue (page number popping out when flipping pages) is easily gone if, instead of using simple Full Screen mode, you use Slideshow (Shift+Cmd+F) mode.\nStill having problems with screen ratio though.\n", "Q: Where are keyboard shortcuts stored (for backup and sync purposes)? Where can I access OS X keyboard shortcuts, say for Dropbox sync?\n\nA: As described in the accepted answer, you can determine an app's shortcuts by converting the plist to xml and then parsing the xml. You can also (tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.6) get the values directly with the defaults read command.\nTo write out the user key commands that apply in all applications run defaults read NSGlobalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents:\n$ defaults read NSGlobalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents\n{\n    \"Enter Full Screen\" = \"@^f\";\n    \"Exit Full Screen\" = \"@^f\";\n    \"Merge All Windows\" = \"@$m\";\n}\n\nTo write out the user keyboard shortcuts for a particular app, use defaults read <app-plist-name> NSUserKeyEquivalents. For example, to get the user keyboard shortcuts for Safari run (in this example, the user hasn't set any custom keyboard shortcuts for Safari)\n$ defaults read com.apple.safari NSUserKeyEquivalents\nThe domain/default pair of (com.apple.safari, NSUserKeyEquivalents) does not exist\n\nKey mappings I have discovered in this string syntax:\n\n*\n\n*command = @\n\n*control = ^\n\n*option = ~\n\n*shift = $\n\nA: The shortcuts that can be set in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist and the property lists of applications (like ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist or ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.chess/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.chess.plist).\nThe shortcuts for services are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist.\n\nA: This command will print the keyboard shortcuts along with the prefix required  to set them:\nprintf \"defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents '$(defaults read NSGlobalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents)'\"\n\nFor an app like Safari, run:\nprintf \"defaults write -app Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents '$(defaults read -app Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents)'\"\n\nThose commands will output something like: defaults write [...] NSUserKeyEquivalents '{...}', which can then be used in a shell script\n", "Q: iCloud sync issues I'm trying to trouble-shoot my syncing problem; I have my Apple ID for my iPhone 5 and iMac desktop, and my wife has her Apple ID for her iPad 2 and iPhone 4. Is this setup preventing all of our devices from syncing?\nIf she takes a picture with her iPhone 4, it will push to her iPad 2, but not to our iMac or my iPhone 5. If I take a picture with my iPhone 5, it will push to the iMac but not to her devices. The same applies if I create a bookmark on my iPhone 5 or iMac; it will not show up on  her devices.\nDo I need to delete her iCloud account and add mine to her devices, or just add another iCloud account (mine) to her devices?\nFyi...devices are on 6.1.2 and iMac on 10.7, iTunes 11\n\nA: Yes. That setup is preventing all of your devices from syncing.\niOS devices allow you some flexibility regarding what Apple IDs you use with what services. For example, you can have a different Apple ID for iMessaging, and a different one for iTunes purchases, and yet another one for iCloud. The problem comes from iCloud as anything that is related to iCloud can only sync across 1 Apple ID. It just so happens that Photostream, and Safari bookmarks are two iCloud services. \nThe problem is that Contacts and Calendars (less so) are often synced through iCloud, as well as Reminders and Notes. Also, her having another iCloud account means she gets 5GB free storage and you two don't have to share that.\nSo, you will have to decide what functionality you want to give up to gain different functionality. If Photostream is important to have consistent across all devices (or Safari bookmarks), then you will have to do what you thought - delete her iCloud account and add yours. Note, you don't have to delete her account any more then select \"Delete account\" on her iPhone and iPad. Generally speaking, this just signs out of the account.\nUnfortunately, like you thought, there is not a way to have two iCloud accounts signed into on one devices.\nPersonally, I wish Apple would develop a \"Shared\" Apple ID system which would allow one to share certain services such as Photostream, yet keep Mail, Contacts, and Reminders separate.\n", "Q: Mirror iPad 2 display to Mac WITHOUT Airplay I'd like to mirror my iPad 2 display to my Mac running OSX 10.6 WITHOUT using AirPlay, because the app I'm running on my iPad won't show the content using AirPlay or using the traditional output at the bottom (like running a cable from there to HDMI on my TV).\nHow can I accomplish this? Are there any app combinations that let you simply mirror the iPad display to the Mac over wi-fi without using AirPlay?\n\nA: Sadly there is no way to mirror your iPad to your Mac without jail breaking it and installing DisplayOut and getting some cable. There is just no way for the Mac to know what is on the iPad without something on the iPad and on the Mac that syncs with eachother.\n\nA: I use Airserver to mirror my iPad on my Mac.

Is it possible to set a keyboard shortcut for resizing all columns individually in Finder in OSX Lion?\nThe way to do it without a shortcut is right clicking a column divider and choosing the second option (Right Size All Columns Individually). The problem is the option gets reset when I open a new window.\n\nA: What works for me (although some quirks remain) is this: in view options (CMD-J) set up your finder window exactly how you would like them all to be. Make sure to check \"Always open in ... view\" and \"Browse in ... view\". When you're happy, click \"use as defaults\". Then open a terminal window and enter the following command:\nsudo find / -name .DS_Store -delete; killall Finder\n\n(it prompts for password and generates some \"no permission\" errors. Could take a minute or two)\nIt removes all the .DS_Store files from your folders. These are hidden files that contain the view settings of a specific folder (you might have noticed them when opening a mac USB stick on a windows machine or whatever). \nIt's not perfect, right size is relative to your finder window size i believe, but it's much better than the frustrating craziness that comes from every folder having different settings...\nCMD-J opens the view options. When in that window, Fn will change the \"Use as Defaults\" button to \"Restore to defaults\". That's pretty close to a shortcut, I'll do some digging to find out how to make it full circle...\n", "Q: How can I hide a partition (or prevent it from mounting)?

The screen just goes black and then the apple logo appears 2-3 seconds later and the device appears to reboot.\nI have tried closing all application running in the task manager (double clicking the home button) and doing a hard reset (holding the home button and power button) but neither seem to have any effect.\nI'm also noticing that the power the device holds is erratic at best, as I had zero charge this morning - completely flat, no power - at then plugged it into the wall and after 5 mins it was at 36% then after 2 mins was at 18% (!).\nDoes this sound like a hardware or software problem? What else can I try to remedy?\n\nA: Just to cover the basics, I'd try a restore before taking it to the Apple Store for service. Sounds like hardware though, IMO.\n\nA: This mimics the experience I had when using an iPhone 3G battery on my 3GS, suggesting an issue with the battery connector, the on-battery circuit or the serial line that interfaces with it.\nSymtomps would be erratical battery indications, extremely slow charging regardless of the power available, ultimately resulting in the battery discharging non-linearly and running out with as much as 30% capacity displayed, hanging for significant fractions of an hour at the \"Charging but delaying boot as battery is less than 5% full\" followed by an equally long reboot loop as this slow charging fought against the increased drain of the more-than-minimum-brightness backlight.\nIf your device is jailbroken, checking with BatteryInfoLite will show a wildly incorrect temperature readout and a battery serial number of 0.\nRestores will fail with error 27 or 29 unless the problem is fixed or the error is bypassed with a Fix Recovery utility (which is not applicable to your device).\n", "Q: How could i use an iMac as secondary monitor for a Windows 7 laptop Recently (less than one year ago) i bought an iMac 21,5\".\nNow i would like to use it as secondary monitor for my laptop.

Couple this with a VNC client like TightVNC or JollysFastVNC (from Jinx), you pay once for the main computer, and can use any number (one at a time) of other computers as a remote display.  This software is currently in Beta, and I found that after 5-10 minutes of use, the remote display slowed and became very choppy.  I don't know if this was because my main computer is running OS X 10.11 Beta, but I suspect it is just issues with the ScreenRecycler product.  Also, the VNC Client does not detect the screen resolution of the host (remote) computer, and so does not allow you to take full screen unless it happens to be one of the predefined resolutions.\nI found Air Display to work very well with acceptable performance, using 2 laptops (1 Windows, 1 Mac) over WiFi 802.11n.  Mac was primary, Windows was remote monitor.  However, you have to pay for each machine (1 at a time) that you use as a remote monitor - opposite of how ScreenRecycler is licensed.  Air Display also used the host computer's screen resolution nicely, but at times motion became choppy.\nFinally, there is MaxiVista - this one is one-way, only uses Mac, Windows or Linux as a remote monitor for Windows.  I have not tested it, as what I wanted to do was use my Mac and extend to external monitors wirelessly, but the hardware is too old to support AirPlay to an Apple TV.  MaxiVista runs from $49.95 to $129.95, which I find to be way too expensive, as the others are around $20.  For the price of MaxiVista, you may as well just buy a physical monitor and skip the network bandwidth utilization and lagginess.\n\nA: Incase anyone is interested, this is a bit late but it could be useful for anyone who searched and finds this page.\nI had a 27\" 2010 iMac and a pc with a DP (DisplayPort) connection so I just purchased a mDP (Mini DisplayPort) to DP cable from PBTech ($11.50 NZD). I don't know what connections you have on your laptop but all adapters I could find worked from mDP to VGA and not the other way around. \nVGA carry analog signals which in terms of quality are one of the worst cables when connecting to an LED or similar screen. It's also probably why there are very little/any VGA to mDP adapters as they would be expensive  and not too many people would purchase them. All sources I searched stated that it was either very difficult or impossible to go from an analog VGA to a digital mDP.\nI did find something that should work for DVI but it is a bit pricey. You would need a Dual Link DVI to DP ($150 used - none selling new) and a DP to mDP ($7.53).\nAccording to this Source VGA to DVI is possible but the cables required \"are harder to locate and often cost upwards for $100\" plus you would still the above DVI to mDP setup\ntl:dr?\nDP connection:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upwards of $8 to get a DP to mDP cable\nDVI connection:\n\n\n*\n\n*~$158 to get a DVI -> DP and a DP -> mDP\nVGA connection:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can find a cable/adapter expect to add on at least $100 on top of what you would pay for a DVI connection\n\n\nHope it helps and doesn't empty out your wallet.\n\nA: Thunderbolt-equipped iMacs prior to iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) (see this document), like your iMac (Mid 2011), support Target Display mode:\n\nTarget Display Mode lets you use your iMac as the external display for\n  another, “primary” computer.\n\nThunderbolt-only solution\nNOTE: This won't work for iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and later iMac models as they don't support Target Display Mode.\nIf you happen to own a laptop with a Thunderbolt port follow these simple steps to extend your display (Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable required) (from KB PH4469):\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the Thunderbolt cable to the Thunderbolt ports on each computer.\n\n*Make sure the iMac and the primary computer are turned on and awake.\n\n*Press ⌘F2 on the keyboard of the iMac.\n\n\n(As a side note: Older iMacs with Mini DisplayPort also support Target Display Mode. The steps to configure and enable Target Display mode are very similar.).\nA comment on DVI to Thunderbolt adaptors\nYou can't use Mini DisplayPort to DVI or VGA adaptors:\n\nto connect a computer with a DVI/VGA port to a Thunderbolt display (from this thread):\n\nI can confirm that Mini DisplayPort to DVI converter works ONLY from a\n  Mini DisplayPort computer port to a DVI display. The reverse direction\n  is not supported by those converters, \n\nThere is some hope, though, as the post goes on to say:\n\nbut there are other much more\n  expensive ones that will convert DVI computer ports to Mini\n  DisplayPort display.\n\nThe poster is probably refering to a product mentioned earlier in the thread: the Kanex C247D Single-Link DVI to Mini DisplayPort Converter, advertised like this:\n\nConnect a (...) LED Cinema Display to your DVI-equipped\n  MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, or PC with this (...) Kanex solution.\n\nHowever, opinions diverge on whether it will work with a Thunderbolt display at all:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nI am sure that Kanex don't do anything that will help you no matter\n  how expensive it may be.\n\n\n*\nAs far as I am aware, and I have done a lot of reading about this, you\n  can connect an older display to the new Thunderbolt port of a new MAC\n  but you CANNOT connect the Thunderbolt display to anything other than\n  a MAC with a Thunderbolt port.  The Kanex thing works from a\n  Thunderbolt port into an older display, DVI or whatever but you cannot\n  convert MAC DVI into Thunderbolt......I think\n\nI've noticed that the LED Cinema Display is listed as a Mini DisplayPort display (from http://support.apple.com/kb/SP502):\n\nso the adaptor may indeed only work with Mini DisplayPort displays, not with Thunderbolt displays, and as far as I can tell, your iMac will act like a Thunderbolt display.\nIt's up to you to try it, although $129.90 (as of this writing) is a steep price to pay for the Kanex adaptor just to test it.\nSoftware-based solution\nIf the solutions described above aren't feasible or cost-effective, you can use several software solutions.

I saved the document with the \"Built-in output\" output device, but when I re-open the document, the output device is set to \"Soundflowerbed (2ch)\". So I have to manually reselect the right output device each time I open my document.\nHow can that setting be saved/restored correctly?\n\nA: In AU Lab, go to Preferences > Document, and untick the \"Use preferred audio device when opening documents\".

Will the fusion-drive function properly? \n\nA: The problem here is not only the Fusion drive but the new iMac hardware as a whole. Older OS X versions usually do not work on hardware released after the release date of the respective OS X due to missing drivers etc.\nAlternatively you could try to install 10.7 in a virtual machine.\n", "Q: Apple not recognizing my id and password Just purchased a software update (OSX Snow Leopard) but cannot download it because my apple ID and password will not be recognized. \nI reset them yesterday, still not recognized.\nI checked to make sure I am not logged in to any other apps.\nI have received a confirmation on my id. I have written down the password Apple still won't recognize it.\nI don't think I am eligible for apple care as my Mac Book Pro (purchased in 2008) is so old.\n\nA: If you go to a web browser and try logging in to the Apple ID website, can you go in and make a change to a phone number or address and have it be effective?\nThat will test that Apple's servers are operational much better than trusting the status page at http://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\nNext, you'll need to verify that the date and time are set properly on the computer/device. You might enable automatic time setting and power down, restart that device to ensure it starts cleanly and connects to the network and gets the correct time.\nThe steps above cover all the major items that cause software update errors - the Apple side being down and the device being out of time and not having a clean start and some pending requests stuck in the queue (or other temporary resource constraint issues that a restart will clear up). \n", "Q: Check if Network Accounts are avalible We have a domain running Microsoft Active Directory and in that domain there is a number of Mac computers running Leopard and later. Sometimes the users are met by a red dot at the login screen, saying \"network accounts are not avalible\". The user are still able to login, and we can SSH to the computer, but the user can't use all the domain functions. Is there a Terminal command that allows us to check if the user currently logged in is connected to the domain correctly?\n\nA: A quick check that I will use is the id username command in terminal, replacing username with a user other than the one you are logged in with.  For example, if I'm logged in as SJobs I would instead use the query id TCook, assuming that TCook is another user within the domain but not on this computer.  This will attempt to query the domain for the specified username and return all of it's values.  If you are not currently connected to the domain it will instead return \"no such user\".\nIf this fails I go back, check my binding, check my network connection, log out and login again.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: From the Mac's shell, first try dsconfigad -show to see what the binding is.  If it returns nothing, then the Mac doesn't have any AD binding.  You can also use dsconfigad to force an unbind and then re-bind.  In some cases it can be advantageous to delete the computer object from your AD.\nIf the binding appears correct, make sure that the Mac's system time is correct; too large a difference and AD won't allow a login.  You can use sudo ntpdate -u time.apple.com to update the system clock against Apple's time servers.\nFinally, make sure that the Mac can communicate with your domain controllers; try the usual troubleshooting, such as pinging your PDC.\n", "Q: Real sleepmode WITHOUT hibernation As the most people, I also googled after setting the hibernatemode, and found the following command:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\n... which should enable the RAM-only sleep mode.

In iOS6, is there a way to check how much space is being used by the Mail app?\n\nA: It's quite hard and you might need to delete the mail and measure the space freed since iOS isn't showing Mail usage like it does for other apps.\n\nIn theory, you should be able to Open the Settings app and presumably:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select General.\n\n*Select Usage.\n\n\nWait for the Storage pane to calculate the current allocation and you will see sorted from most space to least, the combined application and application data usage for each app. If Mail isn't on the list, scroll the content up and tap the \"show all\" entry below the initial list of apps using the most storage space on iOS.\nAs things stand, you will not get Mail as an entry in this list (and might spend several minutes looking for a smallish blue icon among a list of hundreds of apps). \nMy theory is that Apple has implemented code to prune mail storage gradually as your available space becomes low. That would mean that all Mail on iOS is a temporary cache and just like Safari pages held in cache. \nIf all Mail storage is simply an offline cache and not something you can depend on being on the device if you download a large game or take video and otherwise use up your storage, one viewpoint might be that the correct action is to not show the size of this cache no matter how large or small since when push comes to shove, no mail will be retained on the device if space gets low.\nAt best, you might need to actually save a snapshot of your usage and then delete the accounts for Mail from your device and then calculate the difference by assuming all the space freed was due to Mail storage caches.\n", "Q: USB Port of Macbook frequently stop working One of the two USB ports of my Macbook Pro stop working frequently.\nOnce I reboot the computer, then two USB ports work well.\nBut one of them (always the same one makes the problem) stops working.\nI don't know when exactly it occurs and why it occurs.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The ports are designed to shut down when an over current situation is detected. It stands to reason that this circuit is reset at boot, so there could be damage to the sensor or damage / fault to the logic board or it could be a result of actual over current from whatever's connected.\nHave you considered taking it in to a shop for a diagnosis?\nAlso, look in the Console app - all messages - and search for USB. You might be able to see the time when the over current (or other error condition is logged) since the system should notify the logging subsystem when a USB port gets shut down.\n\nA: A proper diagnostic will make it clear if it is the software or hardware problem. You should take it to your local Mac repair Store.\n", "Q: Submitting to the appstore: Once an app is reviewed by Apple, does it automatically go live on the app store? I'm not a developer yet but need a quick answer to this question.\nI know when submitting an iPhone App to the App Store, Apple is reviewing the App precisely.\nI wonder how this works. Lets say the app is fine and Apple says it's ok, does the app go live on the app store immediately or does the developer get a OK-Message and can \"publish\" the app later on?\n\nA: It's actually good you're not a developer since the inner workings of the review queue are generally cloaked under an NDA. Once you join, Apple has a dedicated site for you to ask questions like this and learn how the approval and sale process works. I believe it's common knowledge that you can list an \"on sale\" date when you submit an app for review and then change it later to move it earlier once it's approved, but I wouldn't want to be held to the details of how it works today.\n", "Q: How many monitors can the 13\" retina MacBook Pro output to? The 15\" retina can do three (and itself) via daisychaining two Thunderbolts (or just using the two ports) and with the HDMI port. Is the 13\" retina able to do this as well?\n\nA: According to Apple (http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5219):\n\n4 MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012), MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late\n  2012), and Mac Mini (Late 2012) computers can use an HDMI-compatible\n  device on it's HDMI port while using one Thunderbolt display, or they\n  can use two Thunderbolt displays.\n\n\nA: The hardware of the 13\" Macbook Pro Retina can drive three external displays simultaneously via 2x DisplayPort and 1x HDMI. The laptop display must be off, since the Intel GPU can only drive three displays simultaneously. There is a big caveat though - this is not an \"Apple approved\" configuration, and  hence will not work under OS X. It works fine under Linux, and will probably work fine under Windows, but OS X will only allow two external displays to be active simultaneously, even with the laptop display off and the lid closed. This is true regardless of whether the DisplayPort adaptors are active or passive.\n\nA: The new Retina 13 is able to daisychain and drive two thunderbolt cinema displays, as explained in this very nice article:\n\nSince the 13\" MacBook Pro uses the same Intel HD Graphics 4000, DSL3510L Thunderbolt controller, and single physical Thunderbolt port as the new MacBook Air, it should be able to push a total of three monitors using daisy-chained Thunderbolt Displays. \n\nsource: Ars Technica\nHowever, it's not clear if they can at the same time drive an extra display though the HDMI port (for a total of four including the laptop's display) like the 15 inches model can do. The 15 inches can drive 3 external and the retina display, but it has a very powerful discrete video card. \nConsidering that there are a lot of pixels in that configuration, I highly doubt that the integrated Intel 4000 can do it. It's a very limited video card with shared memory. But again, we'll need to find someone who can try it :)\n\nA: A 13\" MacBook Pro Retina late 2013 can power three external displays plus its own screen which would make four total. Here is a video showing the external displays working; 1 HDMI, 1 MiniDisplay Port, and 1 thru a USB3.0 Port using a Startech external video card to DVI adapter. All the external displays are old Apple Cinema Displays hooked up thru each monitor's Apple Display Connector (ADC), then to Apple ADC to DVI adapters, then to the relevant third adapter plugged into the MacBook. The screens are 1920 x 1200, 23 inch screens. The monitors are around 10 years old, the USB to DVI video card/adapter is around $65 Amazon.\nhttp://youtu.be/ys_Glzkh0aE\n\nA: You can drive 3 including the internal on the 13\". However, you cannot run 3 external displays even if not using the internal.\nsource: I have one and have tested this.\n\nA: Actually it is possible using Active connectors.  I ran into this issue and solved it.  I've written a full article @ http://mkn.us/blog/how-to-use-3-external-monitors-on-macbook-pro-2015/\n\nA: You can run 3 to 4 external monitors (4 or 5 including the main screen). This is done through USB. This video explains everything.

When I send or receive texts, my phone uses my email address and I followed instructions to switch it but it wouldn't let me click on my number to receive messages from that.\n\nA: If you went into Settings > Messages > Send and receive, and you were not able to click on the phone number(s) listed there, this is because they are already in use.\nYou simply need to disable the email address by clicking on the blue arrow next to the email address listed instead and then tap \"Remove this Email\". \nFinally, make sure to tick the correct number from the \"Start new conversations from:\" section. \n", "Q: Can command or option and shift (just those two keys) be assigned as an OS X shortcut? How can I assign command (apple) + shift or option (alt) + shift as a shortcut? It seems that I can assign other keyboard combinations but not this one as a shortcut.\n\nA: You can use KeyRemap4MacBook. This inserts Q when releasing shift:\n<autogen>__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::SHIFT_L, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::SHIFT_L, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, KeyCode::Q</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::SHIFT_R, ModifierFlag::OPTION_R | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::SHIFT_R, ModifierFlag::OPTION_R, KeyCode::Q</autogen>\n\nThis inserts Q when pressing shift, but it requires pressing shift before option for shortcuts like ⌥⇧[:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::Q</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::SHIFT_R | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R | ModifierFlag::OPTION_R | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::Q</autogen>\n\nThis remaps pressing option and shift simultaneously:\n<autogen>__SimultaneousKeyPresses__ KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::SHIFT_L, KeyCode::Q</autogen>\n<autogen>__SimultaneousKeyPresses__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, KeyCode::SHIFT_R, KeyCode::Q</autogen>\n\nSee the source for the key code values and predefined settings.\n\nA: I don't think it is possible. Those are called modifier keys and you can't only use them in shortcut, because the system wouldn't know whether it should interpret ⌘⇧ or wait you add another key like S to interpret ⌘⇧S. That's why you can't use only modifier keys in keyboard shortcuts.\nHowever, some software (like Alfred) allows you to use a fast double press on a modifier key as a shortcut. Apple uses this trick as well since Mountain Lion with the fn key in order to activate voice dictation.\n\nA: I would hesitate to do this. What would happen if, say, you press Command-[any key], and press the Command key just a few milliseconds before the other? Would the OS interpret that as a Command-key press and perform an action? Most likely, the inability to set these keys as shortcuts on their own is for that reason.\n", "Q: Hardware replacement to fix not-working MacBook keys 1 1/2 weeks ago I had the glorious idea to clean the keyboard of my white MacBook Mid2010 with a wet cloth. Now, several keys are not working anymore, and I guess there might be a close-circuit hardware issue.\nWhen the MacBook is open, I cannot enter the sleep mode, since it awakes itself immediately. So, I am using my MacBook for almost 2 weeks as a home computer now: keeping it closed, hooked up to a screen with bluetooth mouse and keyboard.\nRight now I cannot afford it to send it to Apple, because I am authoring a book that is due end of April. But immediately after this is done, I might want to send in my MacBook to Apple to get it fixed.\nNow, I am wondering if someone had similar issues and sent it to Apple? It would be interesting how long such a repair might take (within a week?) and how much it approx. would cost? Because maybe it's not worth repairing this Mid 2010 MacBook, and maybe I should get a used MacBookPro instead?\n\nA: Most repairs in retail stores are for less than 5 days - and more than half the repairs are done in less than 24 hours. \nThere are some bad signs in the symptoms you mention. Sleep sensor failing is often liquid damage. Keyboard keys failing is also often liquid damage. Even if it's not liquid damage, the logic board or keyboard and some other parts would need to be exchanged and the keyboard is part of the unibody frame, so basically it's like taking a car in for a new frame. All the old seats, engine, power train, etc… get hand removed, inspected and re-assembled in the new chassis. It's not that bad, but it's a lot more time consuming than just putting in a fan or a battery or hard drive in. Those take 20 minutes tops.\nSo, as you mention - finish your work, keep good backups and then send it in knowing it's likely to be $150 to $320 to fix (in the USA presumably) and if there is liquid, you should probably sell it for parts, since the repair cost will jump to $800 or so.\n", "Q: Any way to have Outlook 2011 sync imap mail without actually being opened?

The closest that you could come would be to launch Outlook and close its window, which should keep Outlook syncing.  \n", "Q: excessive birthday reminder notifications My birthday reminders started appearing more frequently about a month ago. Usually they only appear once per day, but for example I have been using my laptop for the past 20 minutes and they have appeared three times. This is very annoying.\nHow do I prevent this from happening?\nUPDATE:\nAs suggested by Martin, here is some more info.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)\n\n*The reminders are through Notification Center (from Calendar).\n\n*I am connected to iCloud and have my contacts to be imported from Facebook.\n\n*not connected to yahoo or google.\n\n\nA: Check your calendar enable all calendar and see if you have multiple records of birthdate. I had same issue duplication of birthdate in contacts, facebook account & gmail. And also check remiders if it is set for more than once. I think by default it should be one reminder on date. \nAnd finally click on close not snooze :)\n", "Q: What OS X Timer Application emulates the functions of iOS's stopwatch (clock) app? I am searching for a OS X Timer/Stop Watch application which provides functionality to start or stop a timed counter?\nSomething that looks and works just like the iOS Stopwatch and Timer function would be perfect.\nIt doesn't have to look exactly the same as the iOS app and should have keyboard shortcuts rather than need touch screen / mouse interaction.\n\nA: I would say the Mac App Store has some awesome options - some free, the rest extremely reasonably priced.\nHave a look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*Menu Timer\n\n*My Alarm Clock (and it's free cousin, Alarm Clock)\n\n\nDepending on how much timing and alarming you need, there are even amazing programmable timers like FlexTime\n", "Q: How to take pictures in the dark with an iPhone? The flash on my iPhone 4s works great at night. Problem is the picture is completely black up until the point the flash goes on and the picture is taken. So I don't know if I've got a good shot. Much worse is that it's always completely out of focus because the camera doesn't seem to have time to focus during that flash of light.\nHow do I take night pictures?\n\nA: There are some apps that may help you with dark night photos (though I have no experience with these apps). Here you are:\n\n\n*\n\n*NightCap: This app captures 15x more light to capture the best photos in low light situations. It also provides the best tools to help take the perfect shot day or night.\n\n*Camera Flash and Zoom: A full featured camera app with digital flash, 5x digital zoom, geotagging, preview before saving, quick and burst modes, and plenty more tools for night photography. \n\n*Night fast Snap!: Very suitable for night photography, you can take 30 clear photos in 2 seconds in the case of low light. The app only fires the shutter when it detects the iPhone is steady to ensure sharpness. \n\nA: Well, one idea is to use the video section of the camera, turn on the light, then take a screenshot ( & then crop out the borders if you like.)\n\nA: I use CameraProFx - a free (with adds) paid without adds app which allows to set up the exposure of your iPhone camera so that you can take photos in the dark. \n", "Q: How to prioritize WiFi networks on iPhone I can connect to multiple WiFi networks on my iPhone but the problem is that I cannot prioritize them. iPhone automatically connects to a specific network, which is slower in my case, and then I have to switch to the faster one from the network list. \nHow can I prioritize known WiFi networks on iPhone?\n\nA: To ensure that your iPhone does not connect to the slower network, go to Settings > WiFi > tap on the blue arrow to the right of the slow network > tap on \"Forget this Network\"\nNext, make sure you connect to the faster network. This way, your iPhone will connect to the fast network and not to the other each time the fast network is in range.\n", "Q: Searching for punctuation in Preview In Preview (v 5.3 on 10.6.8), if I search for a single letter such as k in a pdf, the program will find and highlight every instance of that letter in the pdf.\nHowever, if I search for a punctuation mark such as ? or ;, it will report Found on 0 pages, even when the document is littered with such punctuation.\nHow can I get preview to search for punctuation? \nThe reason for this is that I wish to locate all instances of missing references (denoted as [?]) in a pdf output from LaTeX. \n(Yes, I know that LaTeX will tell me where they are in the source file, but I wish to find them in the pdf.)\n\nA: A year late but may help others:\nFor me escaping it in double bracket works so try searching \":\" or \"?\".\nEscaping in double quotes searches for whatever is between the quotes similar to the way google does their search options.\n\nA: Does it have to be in Preview?  Preview doesn't seem to have this functionality as of El Capitan (10.11).  However, I have found and tested two ways that you can search PDF files for punctuation.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Acrobat Reader\n\n*pdfgrep\nAcrobat Reader\nUsing Adobe Acrobat, I simply entered the punctuation into the search field in this case a colon (:) and Acrobat found all instances of it.\n\nNote:  I did successfully test out the question mark (?) and it worked.  Unfortunately, the only document I had at the ready had personal info on it so I couldn't use it as an example.  However, I made sure to test different punctuation from periods, exclamation points, question marks, commas, etc. and all worked.\npdfgrep\npdfgrep is the PDF equivalent to the command line (CLI) utility grep.  The useage is simple:\npdfgrep [OPTIONS] PATTERN FILE\nSo, to search for a comma, and have it tell you what page number it occurs on, simply issue the command:\npdfgrep -n \"?\" foobar.pdf\npdfgrep is FOSS software and available on Homebrew and MacPorts.

However, sometimes messages appear to automatically mark themselves as read after a time period of approximately one hour. I understand that messages in the Mail.app will turn to \"read\" the instant they are highlighted or clicked on, but that is not the situation I'm describing here. I can't find any settings in either application that would automatically mark a message as read after a certain time period.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: This is strange. Are you sure he is not clicking on those mails in his phone? Or somebody else having access to it. Change the password for the email and check again, if this continues then the problem would be either in his phone or imac.\nTry with password change and we will see how it goes.\n\nA: I am experiencing the exact same problem.

Even if someone could point me in the direction of some learning materials so I can work this out for myself, that would be great.\n\nA: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java SDK are not inherently unsafe. The problem relies for the most part in certain ways the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) accesses (and can be fooled to) certain pieces of the operating system. \nLike every other complex piece of software, Java is no different than, say, .NET on a Windows machine or Mono.NET on any flavor. \nJava on a browser, however, is a different world (and hence why you can go ahead and disable it in most modern browsers), similar to (but not as bad as) what ActiveX was back in the days of Internet Explorer. \nYou can safely have the JRE in your Macintosh, Linux or Windows machine with little danger, since no element of the Java RE or SDK will expose remote vulnerabilities by default. It's just a lot of code sitting in your Hard Drive.\nNow if you want to know if executing Java software is unsafe, then there's no way to answer that without diving into huge arguments. If you want to run Java Software, just go to Oracle, download the Runtime environment and run your Java program. It will not be activated by default on Safari (but double check to be sure) or any other browser. \nWith all that said, Java is annoying (especially their updater, which you can tone down or disable but never ceases to be as annoying or sometimes more than the Flash Updater if you have Flash). On the other hand, Oracle finally started rolling more periodic updates to Java so vulnerabilities are taken care more often (which is annoying but good). When Apple was in control of the SDK, this wasn't the case.\nOf course, some \"security experts\" will cry out loud that having Java in your hard drive can lead to more insecurity since someone gains access to your computer, they could exploit local Java vulnerabilities. Trust me, if anyone gains access to your computer (even remote) to the point where they can execute anything (including Java), you have a bigger problem.\nSo if you need it, go ahead and get it. \n\nA: The Java exploits have been accessing through java on websites. You do not need to enable this e.g. in Safari you can set a preference to use Java or not.\nIf you have a command line java application (e.g. Bitcoin) this is then is as risky as an other application. You need to make sure you have the latest version of third party libraries and executables to keep up to date with security fixes.\n\nA: Yes, it is safe to install Java on you computer.\nTo answer your second question, is it safe to use http://multibit.org/ with Java for online transactions, the answer is use Caution as with any money transaction on the web.\nThe real question is about the Mulibit client as you pointed out. Multibit is not the safest out there so consider using others. Multibit connects directly to the network, and there could be your problem. Means you would have to keep the Multibit up to date, but that is no quarantine either.\nhttp://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-wallet-options/\n...There is also more specific website for this type of question here:\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/\nJust to add my personal advice, I would caution you with such products, unless you are expert in keeping your computer safe.\nIt is your money!\n", "Q: Can I put music files on an iPod without iTunes?

My AppleScript app needs to get color of pixel in coordinates 123, 456 in screen.\n\nA: I found a way to do this using only built-in components:\ndo shell script \"screencapture -R123,456,1,1 -t bmp $TMPDIR/test.bmp && \\\n                 xxd -p -l 3 -s 54 $TMPDIR/test.bmp | \\\n                 sed 's/\\\\(..\\\\)\\\\(..\\\\)\\\\(..\\\\)/\\\\3\\\\2\\\\1/'\"\n\nOutput is the color in hex, for example, ffffff for white.\nThe screencapture command takes a 1x1 screenshot of the coordinates, and outputs it in the bmp format to a temporary location. \nThe xxd command reads 3 bytes from that file at offset 54. 54 is the length of the header in the generated bmp file, and the next 3 bytes are the color of the pixel.\nThe sed command swaps the first two characters of the output with the last two. This is because the bmp stores the colors in reverse of the normal order - BBGGRR. This command swaps the order to the normal RRGGBB.\n\nA: Possible, but only if you chain together multiple events:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a screenshot do shell script \"screencapture -l\" & windowid & \" ~/test.png\"\n\n*Crop around the specific pixel using ImageMagick\nOutput:\nconvert ~/test.png -crop 1x1+123+456 txt:-\n# ImageMagick pixel enumeration: 1,1,255,rgba\n0,0: (  0, 74,117,251)  #004A75FB  rgba(0,74,117,0.984314)\n\nThe idea is to crop around a specific pixel, then output it to the special txt: format, with an output file name of - which is of course standard output.\nYou can leave out the the -crop 1x1+X+Y business to just get a listing of all pixels. Also note that you image must have an alpha channel to see the alpha channel, otherwise it just won't get included.\n", "Q: Send audio from my laptop to my iPhone over Bluetooth I have an iPhone 4, and Philips dock speakers which I use with the phone.\nThe dock doesn't have any aux input, and I would like to use the dock as a speaker for my laptop.\nI know I can achieve it through Wi-Fi, but my laptop doesn't have one. Is there any Bluetooth alternative to send laptop audio to my iPhone?\n\nA: According to your comment, you would be happy with a Ubuntu solution where WiFi works.

The games uploaded fine but all my hard earned scores are gone. Do I need to replay levels to get to where I was?\n\nA: Although the developer didn't write the code to keep your progress in sync, you can manually move the save files and settings from identical versions of the App - sometimes even from iOS to a computer version of the game.\nIn a nutshell, you'll need software to poke into the Application's saved files - so you'll need a PC or Mac or to jailbreak both your iOS devices.\nSecond, you'll learn what files and check the versions and move the files.\nWorst case, you crash the new empty version of the app, and delete it and try to move the scores a second time.\nThere are many tutorials on this.

Unfortunately none of the sequels have been updated with this ability yet. According to the TUAW article, the ability to sync other games is  coming.\n\nA: According to the official Angry Birds site, there's no way to back up the Angry Birds score on one iPhone and transfer it to another iPhone.

The macbook pro can see plenty of wifi network around, but very rarely mine.\nThe wifi network is configured properly as I have plenty of other device seeing it and using it successfully. The macbook pro seems to have issue with this network specifically, as it can connect successfully other network.\nMy network isn't completely invisible to the macbook pro, and, once connected it work fine. The signal strength is very good. But most of the time, it simply don't show up in network lists, possibly for hours.\n\nA: MacBook Pro supports 802.11n wifi wireless networking. There are other wifi protocols like 802.11b and 802.11g. MacBook Pro is compatible with these (b and g) as well. Wifi issues prop up when your router supports other frequency and your laptop is trying to catch other frequency.\nIf your router supports 802.11b/g and compatible with n then it means some communication problem may arise between your wifi router and your laptop. Best thing that can be done here is to tell your router that it should send signal (broadcast) only on 802.11n.\nGo to your wifi router settings (you need to connect your router to your laptop through cable for this. You can consult wifi router help book for this) and Fix channel as 11 (11 from 802.11 is called channel) and bandwidth as 150Mbps. n means it will run on 150Mbps. (generally b means 54 Mbps and g means 65 Mbps). Save your setting and you are hopefully ready to run without any hassle.\nPS: You can do the same setting if your wifi is not visible or your MacBook Pro doesn't detect your home wifi.\n\nA: Are you using 5GHz(N network)?

How can I create an email group in my address book easily? Is there any method other than add one email address at a time? I'm using Mail.app to send/receive emails.\nWhen I used Gmail, it was easy to add many email addresses at one time. I just needed to create a list of email addresses separated by commas. Is a similar action possible in Contacts.app?\nI'm on Mountain Lion.\nADD. My situation is that I want to create a contact group for 100+ students who will take my course in the next semester. They are not in my current contact book and I just have their email addresses. Any easy way to do it?\n\nA: Typically, if you had many people from your Contacts you would simply create a group by following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Contacts.app and select \"File\" -> \"New Group\"\n\n*Enter the name of the group you are creating.\n\n*\n\n*This is what you will type into mail, and will effectively be the name of your \"distribution list\".\n\n\n*Go back to \"All Contacts\" and drag the contacts in that you would like to be in your group.\n\n*Now, when you want to sent to that group, just type in the group's name and Mail.app will automatically populate the sending information.\n\n\nHowever, for your situation, that won't work very well as you need to create a distribution list for many people who aren't in your Address book (per your edit). With a tip borrowed from iOS, and a hack, you should be set.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your list of email addresses must be comma-delimited. If it is separated by line breaks, then this likely won't work. So first we need them comma delimited. \n\n*Now we will create a contact, and name it \"2013 4Q Students\" or something.\n\n*Next, we will put our comma-delimited list of email addresses into one email field. \n\n*\n\n*I assume there is an arbitrary limit on how many email addresses you can put into one field, but I don't know from experience what that might be.\n\n\n*Type the new \"contact\" name into a Mail.app compose \"To\" field. It will come up with the standard blue bubble and all those email addresses will be packed inside.\n\n*Now we proceed with a small hack: click the down-arrow next to the contact name in the blue bubble. \n\n*Click \"Edit Contact\".\n\n*Remove the contact name (\"2013 4Q Students\") from the beginning and the \"<\".\n\n*Type Command + right arrow to reach end of email address line, and remove the \">\".\n\n\nJust a little cumbersome, but this should work for you.\n\nA: The work around that I use is to paste the list into your GMAIL account and create a group (very easy as you mentioned before) then download GMAIL Sync (freeware) and the contacts will be added to your MAC contacts and you can create a a distribution list (takes five minutes at most). Alternatively you can export the list from Google as .csv and import into your contacts either way still very easy and can handle lots of email.\n\nA: While appreciate this isn't the answer you likely want, it would be much better to implement groups on the server and address all the students as a single address. This is how a lot of universities and colleges I've worked with have achieved this.\nModules/classes have a name/code, and this forms the basis for the email address, e.g. cs101@myuni.ac.uk\nIt might be worth suggesting this as your institution may already do this and not made you aware, or might like to look at implementing this as it will help other teachers/lecturers who likely have the same desire/requirement. \n", "Q: How do I prevent a menu extra from appearing at login?

But if you want to do it manually...\nrm -rf doesn't work, even with sudo (fs denies permissions)\nThis is the only way to go:\nsudo tmutil delete [path to machine name]\n\nExample:\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/BackupDisk/Backups.backupdb/oldmachine\n\nJust use that command for every machine you want to delete.\nIt will delete every backup for that machine.\n\nA: The easiest way is to use DiskUtil. Use DiskUtil to erase the drive as APFS and then set it up as the Time Machine. Time Machine will convert it to HPFS+\nYou can't just erase the Time Machine drive as HPFS+, because there are files in the backup with an immutable flag. Erasing it as APFS solves that problem.\nI just did it.\n", "Q: Where are the POSIX message functions (msgsnd, msgrcv, etc) man pages in Mac? I wanted to view the manual pages for the POSIX standard message functions: msgsnd, msgrcv, etc. All of them are defined in sys/msg.h and code using them works.

After installing, the magic mouse is connecting ok through Bluetooth. Its left and right buttons are working but scroll is not working.\nWhat drivers or softwares i have to install to make the scroll work? Please inform me.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Following your initial installation of Windows 7 via Bootcamp you need to go a step further, boot into Windows and install the Bootcamp drivers supplied by Apple.  These can be found on your Mac's installation media or by searching for \"Boot Camp Support Software\" at Apple's support downloads page.  The installation of this software enables functions such as your Eject key, iSight camera, etc, as well as functionality for your Magic Mouse.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Mac Pro 2007 crashes repeatedly Yesterday my Mac Pro 1,1 (2007) running 10.7 started freezing up. It keeps on doing this after restart. Usually it will perform one task, but when asked to do a second, it freezes. The cursor will still move but I can only do a hard reboot to get out of the situation.\nIt is independent of which software I start up.\nI have installed a SSD drive for the System OS;\nupgraded memory to 14 Gb\ninstalled a new graphics card.\nDiskWarrior 4.3 will not deal with my drives because my OS is too new (although 4.3 should be compatible with Lion) but it did do a diagnosis of the drives and found nothing wrong with them (it did report a few files with problems).\nDisk Utility also tested the drives and found no problems.\nShould I test the memory? The added memory is about 5 weeks old, though (2x4Gb Kingston). Or could this still be a SSD failure?\n\nA: That could be a lot of things. It could be the system, it could be the hard drive, it could be a drive cable...it could be lots of things. It sounds like it's a drive problem.\nThe following links are \"how-to\" links from the guys that make Scannerz. One is how to use activity monitor to try and isolate processes that are using too much CPU/Memory etc and the other is about bad hard drives. The Activity Monitor post says it's about Mountain Lion, and clearly some of the topics are Mountain Lion specific, but in general it shows how to use Activity Monitor and some tricks I never new about. Here are the links:\nhttp://www.scsc-online.com/Activity%20Monitor.html\nhttp://www.scsc-online.com/Bad%20Hard%20Drive%20Signs%20and%20Symptoms.html\nAlthough you have an SSD, I was surprised to see a post on MacRumors where someone used Scannerz on a system that was having problems that sounded similar to yours. Scannerz found bad cells in the SSD. The owner is replacing the SSD under warranty. He also found his cable was bad. Talk about bad luck!\nIf I had a link to it, I'd post it but I don't. You could go to MacRumors and search their forums for \"Scannerz\" and I would think you would find it. Like some of the other posters in that thread, I though SSDs were supposed to automatically correct bad blocks, but apparently that applies only to sectors that have depleted their write ability.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: That might be a cable problem, or it might be the SSD. The fact that the OS told you that the drive had been removed likely means the supply dropped on it, which can happen if you have a cable making intermittent contact in the supply lines in the cable. In essence, if the supply lines in the SSD cable are making intermittent connections, the moment the they go open, the OS detects it as an improperly ejected drive.\nIf you're using the same cable with the HD and the problems don't re-appear, it's probably the SSD. If they start happening with the HD, then the cable might be the problem. Like I said in my previous post, SSDs are not as infallible as their manufacturers would have you believe.\n\nA: I would test the RAM. Try the old RAM. Just get that out of the way.\n\nA: First I would consider resetting NVRAM and PRAM and SMC.\nIf crash still happens in my opinion you should stress test your hardware to find what is not working properly.\nIn order I would test:\n- Ram (MemTest)\n- Video Graphics (run Apple Hardware Test 2-3 times)\n- Check SSD life with vendor's utility (also check for a firmware upgrade if ram and video graphics are ok but just if it's your last chance)\n\nA: I tested all the RAM with memtest, no errors even though the test sometimes hung. At one point OS told me that I had irregularly removed a drive, which I had not, and lo and behold the SSD drive did not mount after restart. Upon installing 10.7 on a new partition of a HDD, and removing the SSD drive, all problems disappeared. \nI could not run Apple Hardware Test because Safari refused to launch, even after a complete reinstall of the OS. This also pointed to the SSD. Although DiskWarrior and Disk Utility had found no problem with the SSD, it was the culprit.\n", "Q: Iphone 5 and Ipads sharing photos We have an Iphone 5 and 2 Ipads - the photo stream is currently set so that all photos taken on any of the three devices are all in one place.  This is now becoming annoying as I don't want to see all of the photos my daughter or my son take, and vice versa with mine.  How can we create an area where we have three separate photo streams, but have access to them all automatically?  If I want to find one of my photos I have to wade through all the stuff they might have taken.  Thanks.\n\nA: While not automatic, you could setup separate iCloud accounts for each of you (but still use the same iTunes Store account so that you can access the music, movies, apps, etc. you have purchased) and then share a Photo Stream with each so that you can choose what you are sharing with each other.\nThat would be using Photo Stream. I'm not sure if there are better ways of doing it with some other apps.\n", "Q: How can I save a Facebook video from their PR site to my Mac?

I'm open to any solution to get the video file using iOS or Mac software in addition to a technical trick that works in Safari on the Mac. (i.e. I don't need any suggestions for a screen recorder. Screeny app has my back there.)\n\nA: There is an extension that runs on Firefox that can easily snag that video.\nI use Firefox 20.0 with http://www.ant.com/video-downloader\nIt does not work with Safari, but I've tested the Facebook link for you and it will get you the entire 2 GB video file if you have a fast network connection.\n\nYou will get an unsigned extension warning when installing the add-on, since the video downloader isn't signed by the developer. You also need flash player since it grabs the flash file.\n", "Q: iPhone5 (iOS 6.0.1) not syncing with iTunes 11.0.2(26) In itunes under apps tab, it list all the app which i have in my itunes account.

If one (or some) of them, check the app to see if it is supposed to work for iPhone or is it listed for iPad only. These apps work for both iPad and iPhone:\n\nThese are iPhone only:\n\nHave you ever had app syncing work on this phone? If so, what has changed?\nAre you able to add other information (contacts, music, books, photos, etc)?\nAre your apps enabled to sync? Look in the apps tab to see what is marked for syncing:\n\nIs this your own app that you are trying to load on the phone? If so, have you registered the app with Apple iTunes Connect, and added your developer certificate to your keychain, and your relevant information (app-ids and developer certificate info) to your apps info-plist file?\nTo do this, you must be a registered developer, you have to log in to the developer site, and go to the App Store Resource Center.\n", "Q: Could Apple (OS X) wallpaper be licensed for commercial use? Does anyone know who owns the Zebra Wallpaper that comes with MBP Retina Display (and Mountain Lion)? Although this is my specific task (to hunt down who owns one specific likely copyrighted image), it would be nice to know if there is a way to read the image's metadata or otherwise track in general who owns what image that ships as part of Apple's OS.\n\nA: Apple and/or Apple’s licensors own the images, as stated under Apple's Software License Agreement for Mountain Lion:\n\nThe Apple software (including Boot ROM code), any third party software, documentation, interfaces, content, fonts and any data accompanying this License whether preinstalled on Apple-branded hardware, on disk, in read only memory, on any other media or in any other form (collectively the “Apple Software”) are licensed, not sold, to you by Apple Inc.

Apple ought to know who owns the rights to that image.\nTo dereference your question one level further, I suggest the right people to ask or request permission from are Apple Legal.  You can contact Apple Legal through the Apple Legal Contact page.\nUnder \"I have a question about\", select \"Copyright Information\".  Then fill in the form.\n\n\nA: I tried three methods of finding where to find this image.\nThe first is a useful site called TinEye.com. It allows you to upload an image and search the web for it. For the zebra image, I didn't find anything.\nThe second is to open the image in Preview and check the inspector to see if there are any useful info in there.  I didn't find any.\nAfter that, you're stuck looking through stock image sites. I did find what appears to be the original on Fotolia, and Fotolia will allow you to license it for commercial use.\nI noticed that there's a second, larger zebra in the backdrops.  TinEye was much, much more useful here.  The larger zebra seems to be from Steve Bloom and he's got a form on the site to enquire about a license.\n", "Q: Sharing large library of Photos and Videos (currently in iPhoto) in different macs at home currently I have iPhoto on my mac (mountain lion). the library is more than 350 GB (and growing fast). It is only on my computer, but my wife wants to have acces to the pictures too, not only photostream. She has an older mac book (white) running lion.\nMy idea was to centralize the library (NAS) and solve 3 problems at the same time (space on my laptop, and acces to more than 1 user, and backup of the photos (currently on my time machine)). As far as I know, it is not possible to store the iPhoto library on a NAS... So, what alternatives are there? I know picasa, they have a light app for mac, but aren't there any other alternatives? I don't want to split the library. \nI currently use faces and places... and I would like to keep this features. I also like to share pics with my friends via photostream, but this can easily be replaced with other services. \nThanks\n\nA: Have you tried to use something like AeroFS to sync the folder with the iphoto library across the two computers? You will probably still want to avoid making edits at the same time but at least you will have access to the library on two computers. \n", "Q: How do I edit bash shell terminal history? I entered a password in a command line pro or in a terminal window by mistake and do not want to remove my whole history. My shell is bash.\nHow do I edit my bash history in Mac OS X?\n\nA: nano ~/.bash_history\n\nwhen you done, \nctrl+x\nand come back to accept a right answer dude\n\nA: Editing the .bash_history is just a matter of opening the file with an editor. There are a couple of ways you could achieve this.\n\n*\n\n*In the Terminal just type vi ~/.bash_history, then edit the file as you want, and save. This option could be tricky, if you're not used to vi, of course.\n\n*Make the file visible by following these instructions, for instance, open it as any other file, modify it, and save.\n\n*In the Terminal just type open -e ~/.bash_history. This command will open the file with TextEdit, you can choose any other text editor, of course. Modify the file and save.\n\nFor the changes to be noticeable just restart the bash.\n\nA: In terminal type history and note the line number. Next call history -d noted-line-number. You can check that the line is deleted using history again.\n\nA: I think that Dmitry's answer is ideal if done before saving the history - by default, saving occurs on shell/terminal exit.  \nIf you may have already saved the history to ~/.bash_history, then I prefer Thecafremo's answer, but I would suggest adding a step of exiting Terminal to ensure that none of the bash instances have loaded the history and will re-save it.  This is especially tricky if you have multiple terminals and have enabled any sort of command-by-command history update.\nBackground:\n\n\n*\n\n*bash saves the history within an instance of the shell\n\n*bash can write this history to a file, which typically happens when you exit the shell/Terminal\n\n*bash can read from a file into the history, which typically happens when you open a shell/Terminal\n\n*it's possible to change the default behavior so that history propagates sooner, which can migrate your BAD_TEXT to the file and to other windows \n\n\nRegardless of which method you use, I would add one step: verify success!\n\n\n*\n\n*Exit Terminal.app\n\n*Re-open Terminal.app\n\n*Confirm the offending text is not in the history - preferably in a way that will not create additional history.  That is, don't grep BAD_TEXT .bash_history!  This new command would go into history.  I'd just open .bash_history in your favorite editor and search within that for BAD_TEXT.\n\n\nThis should give you peace of mind that you have eliminated BAD_TEXT no matter what kind of crazy bash setup you may encounter.\n\nA: There are several histories for example bash and zsh. You can do this with nano. To do this, simply open the terminal\nWith this you edit the bash history\nnano $HOME/.bash_history \n\nWith this you edit the standard zsh history\nnano $HOME/.zsh_history \n\nIf you want, you can do the whole thing using TextEdit.\nBash:  open -t $HOME/.bash_history\nZsh:   open -t $HOME/.zsh_history\n", "Q: Why is my iPhoto Library size so much bigger than its contents? I've stopped using iPhoto and want to extract my Originals and trash the library itself. After I pulled out my originals, I noticed that they're nowhere near the 8GB iPhoto Library size Finder is reporting. So I checked the package contents, and selecting everything including hidden files, the total size is only 1GB. I copied everything out to be sure, also 1GB. du -hs from Terminal, also 1GB.\nAny thoughts why Finder thinks it's taking up 8GB of space?\n\nA: Go to your iPhoto Library and right-click on it and select \"Show Contents\".\nThen sort by List (Command+2).\nThen go to Finder-View--Show View Options (Command+J) and select \"Calculate all sizes\"\nIt will count up all the folder/file sizes and you can see what is taking up space where.\n", "Q: Console Mode from Desktop With most linux distros you can hit control + alt + F1 or the like, and get a Console.

It's pretty annoying to see your display freeze and know that your kernel is likely chugging along just fine..\nI looked around for answers, but all I could find is the login window hack.\nThanks!\n\nA: No - not only can't you toggle this from your session once logged in, but you actually have to log out of all other graphical based user-sessions before the >console shortcut will work.\n\n\n*\n\n*>console does not work\n", "Q: Which OS X is the fastest for my old MacBook? I am going to do a clean install of OS X on my old MacBook (Late 2008), but the computer will only be needed for:\n\n\n*\n\n*tabbed web browsing (Safari/Chrome), \n\n*word processing (Office/iWork),\n\n*and maybe some iPhoto work.\n\n\nThe most important factor is speed (operating, startup, etc.), and all the added features of each OS X are secondary.\nWhich operating system — the latest Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, or Lion — will run the fastest on this MacBook?\nComputer specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.1 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\n\n*120 GB HDD 5400-rpm\n\n*Currently with OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard)\n\n\nA: I have the same machine & spec, and have not noticed any slowdown when operating at the latest supported version of Lion when compared with previous versions. Of course, this is purely anecdotal, but reviews have also fairly repeatedly suggested a slight increase in basic speeds incrementally with new versions.\nOne this is for sure, throw in a cheap SSD of the same size as your existing disk, and it will fair fly compared whatever it feels like now.\nCompare, for example, your specs to my Macbook Air 1.6Ghz Core 2 Duo, 4Gb RAM and SSD, which supports ML and feels faster than my 2.93Ghz iMac with 8Gb on the same OS (or did until I put an SSD in the iMac).\nPut simply, your CPU and RAM can handle whatever you want to run just fine.  Your disk may start to feel the pinch a little, but small SSDs are very cheap these days and will easily make your machine feel like new - that particular macbook is at the sweetspot of benefitting most from an SSD for the least money.\n\nA: I ended up going with Snow Leopard because Leopard itself was slow (SL offers countless improvements in how it is built, for Intel Macs only), and Tiger, as reminiscent at it would have been to use it, didn't have Time Machine (which admittedly wasn't a requirement in the original question).\nThe reason why I didn't go for Lion is because I wouldn't be able to have it in it's best iteration: Mountain Lion is reported as superior in speed (but not compatible with this MacBook).\nSnow Leopard is running fast and smooth, and personally, I think it's the best fit for this machine.\n\nA: For starters, this machine won't run anything later than Lion anyway.\nI'd suggest putting in a 60GB SSD, and give it a clean installation of Lion.  I have \nI have this model, which is almost the same.  I added an SSD, and even with 2 GB of RAM, it's a fantastic and zippy browser/email client.\n\nA: So many wrong answers.  It's the OLDEST versions that are faster, someome said why, because the new ones require more resources.  I've tested it. With the same hardware, the newer, the faster. Yosemite SLOOOOWWW compared to going back to Lion/Leopard. Just find whatever software you use and see it's OSX requirements to decided how far back you can go. The old ones are lighter weight because it was matched with the hardware.  I tested it on high high end desktop hardware end of 2014.\n", "Q: \"Libraries\" (a la Windows 7) on OS X? There's one feature from Windows 7 that I sort of like (yeah, yeah, I know...) and would like to implement (differently) on OS X.  It's what they call \"Libraries\".  It allows you to have the contents of multiple on-disk directories show up in Windows Explorer (their version of the Finder, for any who've had the pleasure to never need to use Windows) as though they were one directory.\nThe way I'd like to use this is to have directories from multiple drives browsable as though they were all on one drive.  So, for instance the following directories:\n~/Resources/\n/Volumes/Portable Library/Resources/\n/Volumes/FreeNAS Server/Resources/\n\nwould all be visible together as a single \"Resources\" directory.   Ideally my ~/Resources would display the contents of the other two, but it wouldn't kill me if I had to use a different path, such as /Volumes/Combined/Resources/.\nIs this possible to do somehow?  Maybe using something like the mhddfs command?  (That is mentioned here, but it is unclear from the answer whether it can be used in the way I'm describing: I want to merge directories across several drives, not the entire drives themselves.  It also may not exist for OS X.)  Also, when any given drive or file server is unavailable, it should handle it gracefully and not treat it as a failure, since my FreeNAS server will only be around when I'm home, and I won't always have various external drives plugged in.\n(If you're wondering why I'd ever want to do this, take a different example: iTunes libraries.  It would be nice to have the bulk of it on a file server, but have the most-played songs available on my MacBook Air.)\nCan this be done?\n\nA: I was looking into doing this also today, and so far the only solution I've found is to use a smart folder, hacked to search multiple locations:\n\nWhat you want to do is open one of your folders (eg. /Volumes/Portable Library/Resources/) hit CMD+F and then set your desired filtering. eg. I set mine to Kind > Folders. \nSave the search as a smart folder (it doesnt matter where) then open up that smart folder in TextEdit and look for the following: \n/Volumes/Portable Library/Resources/`\nThere will be multiple instances of the above string, you want to replace them all with new strings that contain the paths you want to search.\nIn your case it would look like this:\n<string>~/Resources/</string>\n<string>/Volumes/Portable Library/Resources/</string>\n<string>/Volumes/FreeNAS Server/Resources/</string>\n\nSave the file, then when you open the smart folder it will display search results form all three folders.\nIf you use the column view in Finder you can move through these folders as if they are all together.\n\nUnfortunately the downside of this is that its searching resursively, so you will get all the folders within your first three, plus any folders in those. I'm yet to find a way to disable recursive search yet...\n", "Q: Can I get a 4G data plan for my unlocked iPhone 5 in the US? I have a factory unlocked iPhone 5 bought from my home country. I'll be travelling to the US, and I was wondering if I can get a short 4G data plan (six months) from any carrier in the US?\nLast year, I went to the US and T-Mobile specifically couldn't offer me a 1-month 3G for my iPhone 4, only edge speeds, but I read rumors about recent support of these features... Hence my question.\n\nA: T-Mobile's 3G/4G coverage for an iPhone 5 is better than a year ago but still limited so you are rolling the dice. They just released a carrier update for the iPhone that will give an iPhone 5 access to some of their 4G network. But it's still early days and the usefulness will greatly depend on your location. \nT-Mobile also offers a pay-as-you go plan where talk and text are charged as used and data can be activated on a day-to-day basis.\nStraightTalk is another option for an unlocked iPhone but is only 3G. $45/month for unlimited talk, text, and data.  As usual, \"unlimited\" means \"secret limits\" that we can arbitrarily use to kick heavy users off.\nThe big advantage of T-Mobile is that you can walk into a T-Mobile store and get it set-up. AT&T is still officially restricting the use of non-contract iPhones on their network and walking into a store will be a bust, but they don't actively hunt them down so GoPhone is an unofficial option.  You have to buy a GoPhone SIM and cut it down to size but it will work.  Unofficial and a bit of a PITA but the option exists. You can buy pre-cut cards on Amazon but getting one in a store is a bit trickier.\nhttp://www.dargadgetz.com/how-to-use-iphone-5-on-att-gophoneprepaid-with-4g-data-speeds-payasyougo/\nI suspect this gives 4G/HSPA+ and not 4G/LTE.\n\nA: You can use T-Mobile's \"Individual Plan\". They offer three options. The first one is 50 USD a  month and comes with 500 MB of data. The second one is 60 USD a month and comes with 2 GB of data. The last one is the unlimited one and costs 70 USD per month. Here's the link to their website if you want to check it for yourself.\n", "Q: Is there any Cloud Storage GUI for Mac? On my iPad, I have GoodReader, as well as ReaddleDocs, and both allow me to connect to a large assortment of Cloud Storage providers. On my Windows machine, there are the Cloudberry Lab assortment of products. On my Mac, there are less options.\nI have a license for Syncovery, and have been using it since it was called \"Super Flexible File Syncronizer\". It works great for large pushs and pulls, but doesn't have a great GUI. It also doesn't support as large of an assortment a I would like.\nI found Interarchy 10 and DragonDisk. However, the best front-runner right now is CyberDuck, though the GUI is not super shinny.\nAm I missing any options? Paid or free is fine, as I don't mind supporting any developers for work they do. If it can have the Mac skin to it, it would be awesome!\n\nA: I haven't tried it yet, but the folks behind CyberDuck have released Mountain Duck, it allows you to view remote resources as volumes on the desktop (i.e. integrates Azure, SFTP, S3, etc. with the Finder).\nhttps://mountainduck.io/\n\nA: Check out the Storage Made Easy Mac client. It works with S3 and RackSpace (but you'll need a Storage Made Easy Account)  as well as other Clouds like Google Drive, DropBox etc. It provides an integrated drive (like iDisk used to) as well DropBox style Sync Tools.

It's a great sync manager that supports a lot of cloud storage providers, like Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, Onedrive, Amazon S3, FTP, etc. You can see the list of providers on the homepage.\nThey offer sync clients for Mac and PC, which both support \"unsyncing\", where you can choose to just keep files in the cloud. It works really great and it's pretty user-friendly. You can check out their \"upgrades\" page for the premium plans which offer encryption and external drives.\nJust note that it probably won't be great for huge file transfers at once because of the lack of progress bars or status. It uses file badging like Dropbox and Google Drive to alert you if something is synced, syncing, or not synced.=\n\nA: Cyberduck works just fine with many providers\n\nA: The one I use is called ExpanDrive. It's expensive at about $50, but in addition to FTP, it also supports Amazon, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and many others.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion clean install I've lost my HDD which is unrecoverable on my MacBookPro 5,5. I don't have any Mountain Lion installer or disk. How can I install Mountain Lion after i put brand new disk?\n\nA: If the disk is unreadable then recovery disk will not work - and when you put in a new blank disk it won't be on that one either, so the recovery procedure outlined will not work here.\nYou need another boot disk. (This is where you should wish you had backups with SuperDuper! which creates fully bootable clones of your hard disk).\nAssuming that you don't, you need to use your other Mac (note that the installation disks from another Mac will not work in yours - only purchased OS X disks can be used in any machine).\nIf you have a firewire cable the easiest solution would be to cable the two Macs together. Set one of them to TargetDisk mode, boot the other one off the good disk (I don't think it matters which is used here?).\nBecause your other Mac has 10.5 Leopard you don't have App Store and so can't easily get Mountain Lion (even assuming the failed machine is compatible). Instead I recommend you just clone the hard disk from machine to machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download SuperDuper! (free license is sufficient, but recommend you pay for full license, it is a wise investment).\n\n*Clone the disk on the good mac to the new hard disk.\n\n*Disconnect and reboot.\nYou now have two working Macs with identical files on them - from there it is up to you.\n\nA: OSX Internet Recovery!\nOS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion includes a built in set of utilities in the Recovery System. Restart your Mac and hold down the Command key and the R key (Command+R), and keep holding them until the Apple icon appears, indicating that your Mac is starting up. After the Recovery System is finished starting up, you should see a desktop with a OS X menu bar and a \"Mac OS X Utilities\" application window. Note: If you see a login window or your own desktop and icons, it is possible that you didn't hold Command+R early enough. Restart and try again.\nIn order to reinstall OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion, you will need to be connected to an Ethernet or Wi-Fi network. The Wi-Fi menu item is in the upper-right corner of the screen. Click the icon to display all available Wi-Fi networks. Click your preferred network name and, if needed, enter a username and/or password. \n\nA: Do you have access to another mac ? If this is the case go and download ML on App Store (I guess you have bought ML so you can download it again for free) and then create a key installer with  liondiskmaker 2  (works fine with ML 10.8.3) http://liondiskmaker.com\n", "Q: Changing the default iOS dictionary from New Oxford American Dictionary(NOAD) to Oxford English Dictionary(OED)? Anywhere in  the iPhone when you select a word the Define option pops up from the popup menu. Clicking on it brings up the definition for that word. The default dictionary it uses is the New Oxford American Dictionary(NOAD). I wonder if it can be changed to the Oxford English Dictionary(OED).\n\nImage source: osxdaily.com\n\nA: It looks like this is possible in iOS 7. When you click to define a word, in the bottom left there is a \"Manage\" button. Here, you can tap the X for a dictionary that you want to delete from your device and tap the cloud button to download a dictionary you want. So in your case, tap the X to delete the NOAD from your iPhone, and tap the cloud to download the OED to your iPhone.\n\nA: This is not possible currently as applications implement a dictionary priority stack. That is, more specifically, unless the application specifies a dictionary, the top most dictionary from the \"English\"-dictionaries stack is used. As Apple-apps do not provide a selection interface for the dictionary priority, the NOAD is used.\n", "Q: Turning phone on if lock button is broken? So my lock or \"hold\" button is broken and my phone turned off. My phone is plugged in to the charger and still won't turn on. Also I can't plug it into my computer because my computer doesn't recognize an iPhone as a device. \n\nA: If an iPhone is off, and you connect it to a power source (either a charger or computer), it will always turn on. Since you have mentioned that this is not happening, I would conclude that there is something more serious wrong, not just that your power button is broken.\nIt may be the case that your phone has just 'locked-up' - try holding both the home button and power button for at least 30 seconds and see what happens.\nIf that fails, I would suggest taking it to an Apple Store and see what they say.\n\nA: You probably need to some repairs to your hardware (iphone)\nUnfortunately I do not think it is you button (the plastic piece) but what is behind it.\nHere are instructions where to get it and how to fix that\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/iPhone-Parts/iPhone-4S-Power-and-Sensor-Cable-/IF115-011\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+iPhone+4S+Power+and+Sensor+Cable/7285/1\nIs it easy to do - NO !\n\nA: If it does not turn on like if your lock button is jammed (like mine) plug it in and hold the home button. It should come on. If it doesn't come on, take it to where you got it from or a Apple Store close by.\n\nA: The best thing to do is connect it to your charger and it would normally turn on. If not then you should consider going to Apple or change you phone.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem.\nTurns out it had 'locked up', and to resolve it without the lock button I just  disconnected, then reconnected the battery and plugged it into a power source. After that it worked fine.\n", "Q: How can I turn ~/Documents into a symlink? I keep my Documents in an encrypted directory in Dropbox (~/Dropbox/encrypted), which I then mount at ~/clear when I log in.

I would like to start over with a fresh install on B and copy just a subset of my data, reinstalling applications from scratch, so I am not considering using Migration assistance.\nI am thinking to use rsync to do the job, but I am confused about which options I should use.\nReading man pages, I came out with this:\nrsync -vazHE --progress -e ssh andrea@imac:/remote/dir /local/dir/ 2> errors.log\n\n\n\n*\n\n*v: verbose\n\n*a: archive, to keep times, symlinks, permissions, groups, owners and traverse directories recursively\n\n*z: to compress data\n\n*H: to keep any hard-link\n\n*E: to keep extended attributes\n\n*progress: to keep an eye on job progress\n\n\nAm I not considering some other useful options?\n\nA: Personally, I'd be inclined to drop the z switch. Compression is only really useful over very slow connections (mobile data, dial-up) as the CPU is likely to become the bottleneck. I've certainly seen a drop in throughput with compression enabled.\nAssuming your network is trusted, you would do well to use a more efficient, but perhaps less secure SSH cipher as this will probably speed up the operation a little (it certainly helps with VNC over SSH, or X11 forwarding over SSH).\n\n*\n\n*Run ssh -Q cipher on both systems and pick a cipher common to both\n\n*Use it with rsync -vhaHE --progress -e \"ssh -c aes256-cbc\" andrea@imac:/remote/dir /local/dir/ 2> errors.log\nPS: I also use the -h switch to get more human readable numbers in MB/s as opposed to b/s\n\nA: Turns out blowfish and arcfour were disabled by default for security reasons (as of OpenSSH 6.7), so the above suggestion no longer works.\nHowever, the good news is you can use one of your system's secure ciphers instead.\nTo see a list, run: ssh -Q cipher and then use the one of your choosing:\nrsync -azvP --progress -e \"ssh -c <insert-cipher-here>\" user@hostname:/source /destination\n\n", "Q: Temporarily disable Notification Center in Mountain Lion from command line? I've been trying to create a script to disable/enable the Notification Center, even if it's temporary. It should do the same as manually sliding the Notification Center, scrolling up, and toggling the \"Show Alerts and Banner\" badge.\nAnyone knows if it's posible and how to do it? :)\nThanks!\n\nA: To disable Notification Center from the command line, write a KeepAlive key that is false into the /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist like so:  \nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool false  \n\nIf you want to re-enable Notification Center, you’d just run the same with a true:  \nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool true  \n\nMethod to DISABLE without sudo:  \nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist  \nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nMethod to ENABLE without sudo:  \nlaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist  \n\nThen just hit Command+Shift+G and go to /System/Library/CoreServices/ then find “Notification Center” and double-click it to launch it again\nTutorial with useful info here and here\n\nA: I just simply alt-click on the menubar icon, which actually greys it out and disables it until clicked on again.\n\nA: Just came across this question 4 years later looking for the same thing and came up with this AppleScript that will toggle the enabled state of Notification Center:\n    (*\n    Toggle enabled state of Notification Center menu item\n    Notification Center can be enabled/disabled by clicking the menu item with the Option key pressed.\n    *)\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set ncMenu to menu bar 2 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n        set ncItem to menu bar item 1 of ncMenu\n        set ncTitle to title of ncItem\n\n        set ncTitleEnabled to \"Notification Center\"\n        set ncTitleDisabled to \"Notification Center, Do Not Disturb enabled\"\n\n        if (ncTitle = ncTitleEnabled or ncTitle = ncTitleDisabled) then\n            -- toggle enabled state of Notification Center\n            key down {option}\n            click menu bar item ncTitle of ncMenu\n            key up {option}\n        else\n            -- can't access Notification Center menu\n            display dialog \"Notification Center is not available.\" with title \"Applescript Error\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button \"OK\"\n        end if\n    end tell\n\nSave it as nc.scpt and run it in the terminal by creating an alias in your bash ~/.profile:\nalias nc=\"osascript ~/path/to/nc.scpt\"\nSince OS X Mavericks you may get an error about osascript needing permission for \"accessibility features\". You'll need to add Terminal to the list of apps allowed to control your computer (System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility). Since this allows any terminal script access to the GUI it may be better to convert the script to an Automator app and only grant  this privilege to your app.\nYou can create a keyboard shortcut for the Automator app. See How to quickly jump to another application without using command tab.

I have certain Smart Mailboxes in Mail.app (Mountain Lion, Version 6.3 / 1503) which help me find invoices for my tax declaration. I only need them once a year and would like to archive them for the other 50 weeks, because they clutter my mailbox list.\nI could edit the rules and note down the search criteria, re-creating the lists once a year ... but I am looking for an elegant solution.\nIs there something like Smart Playlist Management (app that exports the smarts of Smart Playlists for iTunes) ... only for Mail.app? Any idea (App, Terminal, workflow) is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Well, really, a smartmailbox is like a rule that is stored inside a mailbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*I would suggest, creating the criteria for a smart mailbox as a real rule. \nMail(menu)>Preferences>Rules(tab).\nThis way, you can just check/uncheck those rules when you want. This may adversely affect the rest of your organizational routines. However, you can choose to move or copy the messages, so perhaps copying could avoid the aforementioned caveat. Or an alternative\nis\n\n*For me, if I go (in Finder) to /Users/myusername/Library/Mail/V2/MailData  there is a file called SmartMailboxes.plist . You could always drag this out (Mail should not be running), and return it when you need it again.\n\n(There are also these associated files:\n\n\n*\n\n*SmartMailboxes.plist.backup\n\n*SmartMailboxesLocalProperties.plist\n\n*SyncedSmartMailboxes.plist\n\n*SyncedSmartMailboxesLocalProperties.plist\n\n*VersionedSmartMailboxes.plist\n\n*VersionedSmartMailboxes.plist.backup\nthat may either need to be moved with, or just deleted. I don't use smart mailboxes at all, just a few dozen rules that I have changed/deleted/had in various forms for years over multiple OS/computer combos.) (Italics indicate a file that is there if you have synced smart mailboxes, which I never have, so that file doesn't exist for me, but does for the OP).\n\n\n*as far as a terminal shell script, you would want to edit the relevant plist files with the strings you need, by adding/removing them as need. You will get the strings you need by looking at the files themselves. You might want an app to look at them cleanly though, this could be XCode, PlistEditor, or something lite like TextWrangler if you're not messing around with XCode.\nNotes: I'm running Mountain Lion with Mail.app 6.2. You should endeavor to always give the software version number of all relevant apps/os's to help the helpers help. I don't know if those files exist in the same way for you (more/less/different name/location), but the place to start for any recent Mac OS X version is the ~/Library/Mail (where ~ is your username/home folder), if your library folder is invisible you can get there by typing in the string in the window that pops-up with command-shift-g.\n\nA: You can create folders for smart mailboxes, and collapse the folder so that it only takes up one line in your smart mailbox list no matter how many smart mailboxes it contains. Use the menu item Mailbox → New Smart Mailbox Folder…, give the folder a name, and then drag your special smart mailboxes into the folder. Click the triangle to the left of the folder to collapse it.\n(This answer has been written based on experience with Mail version 5.3. I do not know if later versions have significant differences, but the option appears to be still present.)\n", "Q: How to disable battery charging? From the pmset man page:\n\nPOWER SOURCE ARGUMENTS\n-g with a 'batt' or 'ps' argument will show the state of all attached power sources.\n[…] Certain Apple battery calibration tools may temporarily disable\n  battery charging, even though your Apple portable is plugged into AC\n  power.\nSuch tools will never surprise you with this behavior; you will know\n  it's happening. This state will be reflected in an additional line of\n  output to 'batt' or 'ps' readings, including the pid of the app\n  inducing this behavior.\n     'ChargeInhibit':    1432\n\n\nSo, does any piece of publicly available software exist to force the battery not to charge?\n\nA: If you use a small piece of tape to block the middle (signal) pin on your MagSafe charger, your Mac will not charge because it can't identify the charger.\n\n\nA: Not an Apple-approved answer, but to solve your root cause (to train battery regularly when your MBP is always at your desk), consider surge protectors with scheduled on/off (example, about $40 in Russia). You can program it to turn off in the beginning of night, and to turn on about 4am so that battery is charged back by the time you show up at your desk. To save charge cycles, I believe it should be performed not daily--but maybe once or twice a week.\n\nA: I don't believe there is any way to disable charging while plugged in (if you have a non-removable battery, as recent models do).\nApple used to make an Airline MagSafe Adapter (which didn't charge computers, so as to avoid tripping the airplane outlet's circuit breaker (or whatever the cause) that resulted in no power being provided at all), but it was discontinued years ago.\nYour computer will automatically stop charging once it reaches a high enough charge. You can't \"disable charging\" except by already having a charged battery.\n\nA: No it is not possible to discontinue charging while it is plugged in. This is a default function that enables as soon as you plug your portable charger in power source, and if any software does that, then it is surely going to harm you device as well as battery even more. So it is better to keep it that way.\n\nA: My Magsafe currently has one of the outer pins stuck in, I cant seem to get it to come out, Ive ordered a new chord, but the interesting thing is that its not charging the battery. It is powering the Macbook pro, but my battery percentage is not going up. maybe try sticking some PVC tape over one of the outer contacts if you don't want the battery to charge?\n\nA: When I opened the cord (between the transformer and the magsafe connector) for the charger on my macbook pro, there were only 2 wires.\n Therefore its seems likely that the tiny middle pin on the magsafe connector does not do anything electrical !\n", "Q: Why did the 10.8.3 update disappear from the App Store after I restarted my new Mac? I’ve just bought a new Mac with 10.8.2 pre-installed. When I started it up for the first time, once I’d gone through the initial set-up, the App Store launched, and showed me an iPhoto update, and some system updates including Mac OS X 10.8.3.\nI quit the App Store, set up another account on the Mac to be my admin account, and edited my main account so that it wasn’t an admin any more. I restarted the Mac, logged in with my main (i.e. non-admin) account, and opened up the App Store again to install the updates.\nThe iPhoto update showed up, but the systems updates didn’t.\nI installed the iPhoto update successfully. I then changed my main account back to being an admin account, thinking that maybe somehow that affected updates. I restarted the Mac, logged in using my main account (now an admin account again), and re-launched the App Store. Still no 10.8.3 or system updates listed.\nAny idea what’s going on? On my old Mac, running 10.7, my main account was non-admin, and I didn’t have any problems installing OS X updates.\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue: Brand new out of the box MacBook Pro 13\" 10.8.2 preinstalled. Went through exactly the same process outlined by the OP.\nResolved by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Closing the App Store\n\n*Restarting App Store \n\n*I then went to Store > Check For Unfinished Downloads\n\n\nThe 10.8.3 update then reappeared and I was able to redownload and install.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I just launched iTunes, and it told me there was a new version of iTunes available. I clicked on the “Download” button, and it opened up the App Store, which now shows all of the system updates I saw before, including Mac OS X 10.8.3, along with iTunes 11.0.2.\nNo idea why it forgot about them for a while, or if I would have been able to get them back if there wasn’t an iTunes update due. (I’m sure I would eventually.)\n\nA: I just unboxed my new iMac 27\" i7. Clean setup with no migration, I did sign into iCloud. I ran updates first thing when getting to the desktop. Updates for 10.8.3, iPhoto, Airport Utility, Camera Raw and one other I can't recall.

In math I'm looking for (x or yor z) AND (date = this year) and I'm getting x or y or z OR date = this year. \n\nA: It's not possible with iPhoto smart albums because you can't combine a conjunction with a disjunction in the same smart folder.  This would work, in a convoluted way, if iPhoto let you use a smart folder as an input, but unfortunately it doesn't (i.e., Album is MY_SMART_XYZ_ALBUM AND date is 2013).  iTunes can do this, but apparently not iPhoto.  Theoretically, it's possible to create \"dumb\" albums with smart contents in Automator, though.  It should also be possible to filter a conjunctive set of elements with a subsequent disjunctive criterion.  But I'm not sure how fast this would perform.\n\nA: ... you can but it's a bit manual...\nUse the \"Or\" statement to get all your family members into one smart album.\nSelect every photo and add the Keyword \"Family\".\nNew Smart album for Keyword Family and Date between = x & y.\nOnly problem is when new photos are added you'll need to update your Family Smart album's Keywords.

I'm currently mirroring from my iPad to my Apple TV, but the audio source automatically sets to the TV. At night I'd love it if I could switch the audio source to my ipad so I could hook up some headphones, while watching on the TV. Is this possible?\n\nA: This isn't possible with how AirPlay currently works. It's a great idea to send to Apple for future consideration, however.\nOn my Panasonic Viera theres a headphone jack and a seperate volume setting for the headphones (so you can turn the TV right down). I've also got a set of TDK wireless headphones which do double duty (TV, iPad, iPhone). They've got line-of-sight range of about ten meters so you can move around without causing disturbance. Smaller TV's generally dont have audio out, but if you're looking to watch stuff in bed, why would you need anymore than the iPad fullscreen.\n\nA: Not an easy solution but I use an old Airport express plugged in next to the sofa with a pair of Bose Quiet comfort. The headphones are plugged in directly into the Airport. From the Apple tv airplay setup menu, I chose the airport express as speakers. Since the Quiet Comfort are powered headphones, this works quite well. The sound is actually amazing + noise cancellation which is pretty sweet if you have kids...

Also, after first opening up the laptop, the key seemed to be stuck down until I tapped it a few times.\nI had a replacement rubber spring from my old MacBook, so I tore the one off the new laptop and put that one in its place, without gluing it down or anything. Right away after that I noticed that pressing Caps Lock would sometimes trigger a tab; maybe one time in seven or eight presses. Worried I had shorted something, I shut down, repositioned the spring, and booted back up, and things seemed normal again.\nSatisfied with the way the Tab key was now behaving, I decided to superglue the spring as instructed on laptopkey.com:\nSqueeze a small amount of super glue onto a sheet of paper. Then dip the\nedge of the rubber cup into the super glue. Then place the rubber cup in\nits place. Let it dry. You want to have the minimum amount of glue on your\ncup, just enough to make the cup stick while installing the hinges onto\nyour keyboard.\n\nI let the glue dry for a few seconds before putting the key cap back on, and while I was waiting I pressed on the spring a few times to make sure it was still springy. Unfortunately, I got way more glue on the spring than I had intended, and it oozed out a little. I also later realized the spring was displaced a little from where the original one had been (as evidenced by the still-visible metal circle under it).\nWhen that was done and I booted back up, I found the key to be better than before, but it still seemed to require a little more pressure than other keys, and it didn't make the same clicky sound when I hit it. I decided to live with that. However, when I opened the laptop again this morning, I found that the Tab key, although it still works, moves up and down very slowly; it takes a second or two to pop back up after I press it. There really isn't any tactile feedback to speak of, so it's worse than when I started. Tapping it quickly a few times didn't cause it to release, the way it used to.\nI'm about to order a new rubber spring and hinge kit (and maybe a key cap). How should I install the new spring to make the Tab key act like new again? Is there a specific way I should clean off the old rubber and super glue?\n\nA: These sort of surgeries are always \"twitchy\" at best. Worse, the new butterfly key design makes these way harder. With the original chicklet style keys, a good technician would get 50 to 90% success rate. I would expect the inverse - high failure rates on the 2015 and newer key designs. \nThe tolerances in the keyboard area (mostly the scissors) are very, very thin - and at some point, extra hard superglue or some cup that's 0.2 mm to the left of where it should be will require you to get a proper replacement.\nIn the pre-unibody days, the keyboards were a single piece that you could easily exchange.\nNow, the keyboard is screwed into the unibody frame, so it's a very deep surgery to get everything removed and then handle more than 50 exceptionally small screws to get at the back sides of the pieces where the rubber springs that yield the touch for each key are mounted.\nLastly - even if you do replace things - the keyboard action is not what it was (and most likely even close) - so if you're the type of person that would keep on typing even if the key cap was missing entirely - go for a repeat repair on the rubber nubbin with a razor blade and superglue. If not, it's time for a proper repair or using an external keyboard while you save money for a replacement. \nIf you were to get a precision knife to clean out the prior repair and choose a more flexible adhesive, you might have better luck.\n\nA: I have this issue as well, after forcefully removing the perfectly fine old rubber cup to install the one that came with the replacement. I have used double sided tape to install it, leaving a gap for the activator. Not sure how long this keeps working, but it does work in principle.\n\n\n\nA: From a comment from the OP: My silicone was all dried up so I ended up using superglue again, but was careful about not using too much or pressing the spring down. It's been fine since then.\nYou can buy replacement cups on ebay.\n", "Q: How do I play HTML5 videos with unsupported formats on iOS? When browsing on iOS I find that I increasingly come across sites where the site's video format is not supported by by iOS Safari or Chrome.  At one such site, the error reads as follows:\n\nThe video you are trying to watch is a format not supported by the HTML video tag in this browser.\n\nWhat is going wrong?  Is there any way to play such videos on iOS?\n\nA: I'm not sure what video you're referring to, as there is no video in your link. But I assume there was a video there when you posted that didn't work.\niOS does only support video-streams in AVC h264, MPEG-4 and Motion JPEG, and only M4V, MP4 and MOV as containers/file extensions. Other apps are allowed to include their own codecs and can therefore play other formats, but most don't.\nMobile Safari does only utilize the native codecs and will only play those formats, and HLS-streams.\nThere is no official way to get Mobile Safari to play other types of videos, and most likely does Chrome as well. If you can get the direct link to the video you could try use VLC or CineX.\n", "Q: Notes keeps prompting me for POP passwords The Apple Notes app (Mountain Lion) keeps asking me to enter passwords for my various email accounts (POP) that I've added to Mail. Mail does not prompt me to re-enter any passwords, but sometimes Notes will ask for the password twice before it accepts it. Thing is, I don't even want Notes to use my POP accounts, just iCloud. But there doesn't seem to be a way to turn notes off for a specific account.\nHas anyone seen this issue? Is there a way to remove my POP accounts from Notes that I haven't discovered?\nThanks.\n\nA: Does codesign -vv /Applications/Notes.app/ print something like a sealed resource is missing or invalid? If it does, the code signature is invalid, so the application isn't allowed to access the keychain automatically. Copying Notes.app from another Mac or a backup or upgrading to 10.9 would probably fix it.\nYou can disable email syncing in System Preferences:\n\n", "Q: If I turn on FileVault for a TimeMachine drive, are previous backups encrypted I have been running TimeMachine for a couple of months, but just now decided to encrypt my backups.  Having ticked the box for encryption for my backup drive, TimeMachine nows says I have no previous backups.  However, when I look in the backup drive I can see all the backup folders.\nAre those backups encrypted, or is it just future ones?\n\nA: FileVault itself does not encrypt TimeMachine backups at all. But you can specify TimeMachine encryption separately under the TimeMachine options. All contents on the disk should be encrypted then.\n\n", "Q: Will the sound processor in an iPad outperforms MacBook Pro's? So iPads or any other iPod or iPhones uses audio codec from third-parties, most likely Cirrus Logic in recently products. For example, the iPhone 5 uses Apple-branded Cirrus Logic 338S1077 audio codec according to this iFixit teardown.\nI am not sure of the codec used in MacBook Pros, especially my 15\" retina one, but I am thinking that since the audio is the Intel integrated one, the codec is probably Intel-branded.\nBut the question remains, which would yield a better quality. The one on MacBook Pro or the one on an iPad or iPhone.\n(Assuming playing the same AIFF file, outputting through the headphone port to a same headphone.)\n\nA: It's a Cirrus Logic audio codec  :\nSource : \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/cracking-open/teardown-shows-retina-macbook-pro-is-nearly-impossible-to-upgrade-difficult-to-work-on/696   \n\n*http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-apple-macbook-pro-with-retina-display/6372862?seq=79\nSo I would say the iPad won't outperform the MacBook Pro. \n\nA: My side-by-side comparison on my hi-fi system has revealed to my ears that the macbook outputs a much higher quality sound than an iphone5 and ipad3.\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the default gateway of the DHCP server side of an Airport Extreme I will try to be brief. In my career I have always used the upper end of the subnet for network devices. For instance, I use .250-.254 for network devices such as the routers. I am very fond of using .254 as the default gateway for internal networks. Is there a way to change the private network default gateway of the Airport Extreme to x.x.x.254? As an example, the factory default network is 10.0.1.0/255.255.255.0 with a default gateway of 10.0.1.1. I would like to change the gateway to 10.0.1.254. \nBy the way, I think this community has put together a fantastic site.\n\nA: Just configure the AP in Bridge-mode so it's running DHCPD and distributing addresses.\nThen, on the internet tab configure it statically and give it the high IP you want. You probably want to configure the range to be 1-253.\nPersonally, I find Airport Utility 5.6 to be better than the 6+ versions. You might want to give that a try too (see here for how to get it).\n\nA: I have never been able to accomplish this when the AirPort itself serves up DHCP. Even if you enter a DHCP reservation for the MAC addresses of the hardware, it seems to configure itself for .1 rather than the address you wished to reserve. I guess the hardware grabs that address before it starts DHCP.\nNow, if you were to have another DHCP server and let the AirPort run in bridge mode (you lose both DHCP and NAT in this case) you might have a chance at setting the router and default gateway to be x.y.z.254 but that seems a lot of work to keep with your preference and probably will break things you need the AirPort to do for you.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 disabled after several failed password attempts? My friend has an iPhone 4. Yesterday it got disabled after several failed passcode attempts. When you press the turn on/off switch or the home screen button, the following message appears:\n\niPhone disabled. Connect to iTunes.\n\nThe problem is that it was synced with a computer she doesn't own anymore. And she doesn't want to lose any of her data. I wonder if it could be recovered without any data loss. \n\nA: The only way if you don't have a backup (on pc/mac or iCloud) is to recover data with a third-party software before you attempt to restore with iTunes.\nThis one is well reviewed (but not cheap).\n", "Q: How to type backslash in Russian on Macbook pro I can't find the backslash key\neither in low case or upper case(by holding shift key)\nin Russian input method( I chose it on input source) on Macbook pro.\nBut if I choose russian pc input method, there is no \"e with two dots above\", but in the place having slash and backslash.\nAny one has a solution to this typing problem?\n\nA: Try Russian Phonetic, option/alt + shift on the rightmost key on the bottom row.\nI think to have the ё on Russia PC, you need to have an ISO keyboard (one with an extra key between the z and shift).\nSome time ago I made a Russian PC layout where that character is more accessible.

I'm looking for something, probably some kind of action script, that will at any time move everything that's on my desktop directly to a specific folder on my desktop, based on the extension. Just to prevent cluttering.\nSome examples I want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Folders: Do not move\n\n*.PSD/.Ai/.INDD (all Adobe workfiles) -> Move to -> ~/Desktop/Workfiles\n\n*.PNG/.JPG (etc., All picture files) -> Move to -> ~/Desktop/Pictures\n\n*.doc(x)/.xls/.pdf (all document files) -> Move to -> ~/Desktop/Documents\n\n\nOthers I guess I can do myself based on the how-to for above.\nI hope someone could help me with this! Any action script/Mac functionality/3rd party app (free/paid) that does this is acceptable, with the only minimum requirement the check and move of files must be directly/every 30 mins (at max)\nThanks!\n\nA: You can do this in the terminal (shell). Open the terminal and type cd ~/Desktop to change you current working directory to the Desktop.\nThen for the different cases you listed:\nmv *.PSD *.Ai *.INDD ~/Desktop/Workfiles\n\nmv *.PNG *.JPG ~/Desktop/Pictures\n\nmv *.doc *docx *.xls *.pdf ~/Desktop/Documents\n\nmv file target is the command to move files. You can move multiple files at once: mv file1 file2 file3 target. The asterisk * is the so-called wild card character. So * stands for every character or character sequence. *.doc would mean that it would affect all files that end with .doc. You could also do it other way around, e.g., A* to affect all files that start with A.\nIf you want, you can copy the following lines into an empty text file and save it as example.sh and add #!/bin/bash to the first line. Make it executable by typing chmod ugo+x example.sh. Then, you can use it every time you want to move your files from your desktop by typing ./example.sh in the shell from your desktop.\nSo the suggested script contents would could look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/Desktop\n\nmv *.PSD *.Ai *.INDD ~/Desktop/Workfiles\nmv *.PNG *.JPG ~/Desktop/Pictures\nmv *.doc *docx *.xls *.pdf ~/Desktop/Documents\n\nAs mentioned in the comments, you can save it as example.command and use chmod ugo+x to make it clickable and executable\n\nA: In Automator do following, \nOpen Automator and select \"Services\"\nThan recreate this for your images files.\nLet me know if you have problem.\nSave this \"Service\" and give it a name like \"Move images from desktop\"\n\nIn Finder only select the one(s) on your desktop you want to move, and under Finder select Services and than you will see your service you just made, so select it.\nNow every time you want to clean your desktop just to the above.\nIf you want it even faster, you can assign a keyboard short cut for it.\n\nA: Hazel is what you want.\nIt's like Mail.app rules or Gmail filters, except for your files.\nHere's an example rule that will do what you're looking for in the first set\n\nIt costs $25. It's worth that much and more. If you value your time at $5/hour this app will pay for itself and increase your satisfaction with your Mac usage. \nIt's basically a servant in app form. :-)\nThere's a 14-day free trial, and the developer is extremely responsive. Your money will go to help support a great Mac app that does something incredibly well. Actually, it does lots of things incredibly well.\n(Note: I have absolutely no connection to this app or its developer except being a huge fan.)\nYes, you could write your own shell script or AppleScript to do this with launchd. I could do it faster than you could, because I've done it before. But I bought Hazel. Why? Because it's the best solution.  And once you start using it, you will find so many different uses for it, you'll be glad to have it.\nSeriously I can't use a Mac without this anymore.\nWhat you can search for:\nHere are the \"attributes\" you can search for:\n\n(\"Kind\" is thing like \"image\" or \"document\" or \"folder\".)  \nYou can setup multiple criteria per folder, and you can set the precedence as to which rules run in which order.\nWhat you can do for matching files:\nHere are the actions that you can take on a file which matches those attributes:\n\nDownload the demo and start using it, and in two weeks I bet you won't want to give it up. \nExamples\nHere are some things that I do with Hazel:\n\n\n*\n\n*When a new .zip arrives in my ~/Downloads/ folder, I automatically open it with The Unarchiver which unzips it to ~/Actions/Unzip/\n\n*Hazel looks in ~/Actions/Unzip/ for files which end with .app and if it finds any, it moves them to /Applications/\n\n*.pkg files? Hazel opens the Installer app\n\n*.dmg? Hazel mounts it\n\n*.pdf? Hazel moves it to ~/Dropbox/Documents/Downloads/ and then opens it\n\n*Image? Hazel moves it to ~/Dropbox/Photos/\n\n*New .amz file in ~/Downloads/? Hazel moves it to ~/Music/ and then runs clamz on the file\n\n*new PDF in ~/Actions/OCR/? Hazel opens it in ABBYY FineReader\n\n*New file in ~/Actions/ToAir/? Hazel will scp the file/folder to my MacBook Air from my iMac and then move the file to another folder when it is done. (Ditto on my MacBook Air if if put a file into ~/Actions/ToiMac/)\n\n*I have Drafts setup on my iOS devices setup to save snippets as text files in specific folders to trigger actions on my remote Macs.

Will there be any problems if I send a javascript and html app to the App Store, which uses the Google Maps API. The app is a route planner.\n\nA: No, there shouldn't be any problems. My app was essentially just a web frame, which loaded a HTML page which used Javascript and Google Maps API. Apple accepted this fine. My current app uses Google Maps API and displays this on an Apple Map, and again, this was accepted.\n", "Q: What exactly does the Mountain Lion Migration Assistant transfer? I have a mid-2012 Macbook Pro, but I am likely getting a new one soon. I have lots of applications and documents. I understand that Migration Assistant can transfer my documents and applications. Will it be able to properly transfer my Steam games and my Parallels Win7 install (which also has Steam in it with a few games)? Will I have any issues with licensed software that I've purchased, such as Sublime Text 2, BusyCal, and any other software?\nAlso, I have an HDD Time Machine backup; is it easiest to transfer from that or from my current Macbook?\n\nA: Apple has a very nice explanation of how Migration Assistant works, what steps and accessories you need and much more:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to use Migration Assistant to transfer files from another Mac\nIn a nutshell, Migration Assistant has three bins of data to move:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications (just the programs - no user data or settings transfer)\n\n*Users (the user data, settings, preferences, saved files and such - but no Applications. You could have all your Word docs, but no Word to edit them in this case)\n\n*Everything else that's not an App or a User. This gets oddball things like /Users/Shared files and folders that don't belong to one user, unix and command line tools like homebrew that get installed outside /Applications and /Users. \n\n\nSo with three check marks (let's assume you don't have multiple users), there are 7 combinations you could migrate - each leaving a different set of data on the destination Mac. (If Applications was A, Users was B, and Everything else C) You could combine them as follows: A, B, C, A+B, B+C, A+C, or A+B+C\nI would say, you get to experiment when you get your new Mac. Run the migration you think is best, and then test it. If you don't like it, erase the destination Mac (booting into recovery mode, erasing the HD and re-install a clean OS might take 25 minutes on a fast network - the OS download is 4 Gb or so) and re-run the assistant.\nFor me, I would recommend both migrating from your Backup and then optionally re-migrating from the old Mac. It's important to test your backup - when was the last time you tested a restore to be sure you have a viable backup?\nEveryone says \"make sure you back up\" but they really mean and might be better saying is, \"make sure you can restore your backup and it has what you need!\"\nI would encourage you to configure your Time Machine on the old Mac to exclude any things you don't want moved to the new Mac, make a back up and write down the time of the back up. Then eject the backup drive and change the backup settings to back everything up again.\nYou could take that \"latest\" backup and Migrate it to the new Mac and test for a while (re-connecting the backup drive to the old Mac) to keep your \"main\" Mac backing up. \nAs you test the new mac for a day or so, you can decide it's time to move over. At that point, turn off Time Machine on the old Mac and connect the backup drive to the new Mac. It will offer to \"inherit\" the old backups and you can move forward. Worst case, you still have the backups to restore something needed and then can clear the old Mac for donation, sale or mothballing.\n", "Q: Xcode 4.6.1 install hangs at \"Installing - less than one minute\" on Lion I have been trying to update to Xcode 4.6.1 (from 4.6) on OS X 10.7.5.  The install gets most of the way through, then hangs out at \"Installing - less than one minute\" indefinitely.  Based on old threads about similar problems I've ensured iTunes and iTunesHelper are both not running.  I've restarted and tried again.  What else can I try or look into?\n\n...\nand I wonder if this has anything to do with it?\n\n\nA: The problem in this case appears to be that the developer site was down.  Once it came up, install proceeded without problem.\n\nA: Once you have downloaded the full installation package, cancel setup, turn off Wi-Fi and restart installation. Setup will complete normally.\nMy understanding is that the setup skip the 'connect to dev site' step.\n", "Q: How do I create a SSB for Outlook web mail using Fluid? Has anyone successfully created a fluid app for outlook web mail (aka live mail)?  I've tried but either the site opens in my web browser or (after white listing variations of the site url) I get an error message stating that I need to use internet explorer or an updated version of safari.  The site opens fine in my firefox web browser (my default browser) so I don't think it's a browser problem.\n\nA: When you create a Single Site Browser (SSB) with Fluid, by default it only allows you to access specific URLs within it. The allowed URLs are by default (in this example): *outlook.com*.\nWhat you need to do is open the SSB, enter it's preferences, choose the 'Whitelist' section, and add *live.com* to the whitelist. This should allow you to access both the login page, and actual Live Mail interface without issue.\nIf pages continue to open in your browser, take the URL and add it's domain to the whitelist.\n\nA: I also needed to add office.com to my whitelist if people are still having problems... Or you can just flip it to \"allow browsing to any URL\".\n", "Q: Can i create my own back up iCloud account other than the one my ex boyfriend set my iphone up with? When I first got my iPhone, my boyfriend set it up with his iTunes and iCloud account because I didn't have one of my own. We recently broke up, and he then changed the password for his Apple ID and iCloud account so I couldn't download any more music and/or apps. I have a lot of things on my phone that I really don't want to lose. How can I back my iPhone up without losing anything on it especially the music and contacts I have?\n\nA: You can do this by signing out of that iCloud account. Open the Settings.app and go to iCloud. Then select \"Delete Account\". Not to worry, this doesn't delete any information from your device, as long as you choose \"Keep on iPhone\" after signing out of that iCloud account. It will display a prompt after you select \"Delete Account\", and give you the option of keeping iCloud contacts, calendars, and such on your phone. Like I just mentioned, you will want to select \"Keep on iPhone\" when facing this prompt. After signing out of iCloud, create an Apple ID (there should be a way on the iPhone itself), and sign into it.\nAs a side note, unfortunately, you will likely have to purchase any music, or apps, again, that were purchased on his Apple ID. The apps that were purchased with his Apple ID will continue to function, but you will no longer be able to update them, and consequently, the need will likely arise that you will need to purchase them again.\n", "Q: How can I make iOS 4.3 apps go onto my iPod 2G? Last Christmas I was given an iPod 2G and it runs on iOS 4.2.1 and I have found it very hard to find apps that go onto my iPod, is there anyway I can make apps that run on iOS 4.3 an above go onto my iPod?\n\nA: No. Unfortunately, due to hardware limitations, Apple has limited how far you can upgrade iOS on particular devices.\nSee this question for a similar situation. Perhaps this Q/A would explain things better as well.\n\nA: You can get whited00r 6 that just came out.

The current one (model A1309, FWIW) has had ~1000 cycles now and can't hold the charge reliably anymore.\nBeing from a small EU country, I'm now facing a surprising dilemma. We only have one official reseller of Apple equipment and three or four companies that claim to service Apple devices, but I doubt they are all official. Nevertheless, I've sent an enquiry about the battery to all of them. One responded they can't deliver and another told me the price is €330, assembly included. I'm still waiting for the other responses, but I'm not optimistic.\nIn the mean time, a quick search of the web tells me there are plenty of EU-based sites that sell compatible batteries and deliver to my country. While some claim the batteries are OEM, it's obvious that most are knock-offs, otherwise they wouldn't cost sub $100, delivery included.\nBut my dilemma isn't so much about money (although $430 is a bit over the top for a laptop battery). It's about the fact, that there probably aren't any new OEM batteries available, because Apple moved away from 17\" MBP models and user-replaceable batteries as a whole some time ago. Even at $430, whatever I get, probably won't be fresh from the assembly line. And I'm fairly certain I can't expect to get another 3 years out of a battery that's been laying around some warehouse unattended for 2+ years, OEM or not.\nSo I'm pondering... Is it better to try my luck with a much cheaper knock-off that's likely fresh, or trust the quality of an expensive and potentially quite old OEM battery?\nWhat would you do given such predicament?\n\nA: I would have buy the battery on iFixit which provide a great service and a lot of good (OEM) products and change the battery by myself or a friend. (It's not so hard, as long as you can use a screwdriver and follow a tutorial!)\n", "Q: Is there a dock for switching between windows? Is there a feature or an add-on for OS X that lists the current app's open windows for quick visual switching? \nThe way I envision it is in the form of a second dock, say on the right-hand or left-hand corner of the screen.\nA similar question was asked here, but the HyperDock answer doesn't work for me.

It seems like it has something to do with which network I am connected to.\nExplanation of the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*I get home from the office and wake my MacBook Air up from sleep\n\n*I login with my regular account (in these groups: Admin, Managed, Mobile)\n\n*It can anywhere 15 seconds and several minutes before I get logged in\n\n\nWhile I'm at the office, it takes less than 1 second to login; it's pretty much instantaneous. The interesting thing is that, it seems like it only occurs the first time I login from home, or subsequent times if the computer has been sleeping for a longer period of time.\nIt seems like it's somehow related to which wired/wireless network I am connected to; as if it's trying to authenticate with something before logging me in. I've tried many different things (turning on/off wireless, VPN, changing user groups, etc.) but I haven't been able to determine the source of the problem.\nHas anyone here experienced something similar?\nMany thanks in advance,\n– Leif\n\nA: You mention it is/was a work account. Also that it is a managed account. Would you happen to be connecting up to an Active Directory or other directory account? If so, your directory server could be specifying that your account try and connect up with a network share on login. If your connection is wireless or something that passes login credentials in order to authenticate to the network, this may well create significant lag on login. \nTo test, fire up Terminal and enter:\ndsconfigad -show\n\nIf the \"Mount home as sharepoint\" value is set to Enabled, your account is likely trying to connect to a share on login. To prevent this, simple run the following command:\ndsconfigad -sharepoint disable\n\nNote: this is all assume Active Directory connection, being one of the more popular enterprise/work domain services. \n", "Q: What is the finder's default midi player and how does it know which instrument to associate with tracks? What is the finder's default midi player and how does it know which instrument to associate with tracks?\nAlso where does it take those instruments from? A VST?

I am trying different solutions to transfer some 1 GB size files between two Macs on my local wireless network (typically between me and a guest, both being physically in the living room). Here are the solutions I have come up with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Through SSH (scp command): I get a transfer speed between 3 and 4 MB/s.\n\n*Through Skype, the rate fluctuates a lot, but can reach up to 2 MB/s.\n\n*Through AirDrop, I only get about 150 kB/s!\n\n\nObviously, AirDrop on recent computers is easier: it doesn't require the other person to have an SSH port open, or to have a Skype account. But it's so very slow…\nWhy is AirDrop so slow? Is it a typical transfer rate? Is there something I can do to improve it?\n\nA: It could be interfering with existing wifi network, you can use the Airport command line tool to disconnect from other networks:\nBegin by linking it to a another location:\nln -s \\\n  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport \\\n  /usr/local/bin/airport\n\nThen, disconnect from the current network:\nsudo airport -z\n\nYou should be running at about 10 Mbps !\n", "Q: Time machine error-1 How can I solve the problem - The backup disk image “/Volumes/Time Capsule de xx/MacBook Pro xx.sparsebundle” could not be accessed (error -1).\n\nA: In Time Capsule go to \"Disk\" then \"File Sharing\".

I want to gift an OS X app, specifically OS X Mountain Lion to my mother in-law. How do I achieve this from the OS X App Store? I can't find any gifting option for both apps I own and apps I do not own.\n\nA: Currently, it is not possible to gift Mac App Store apps directly. There is a workaround where you could buy an iTunes Gift card (from the iTunes store home menu) for exactly the price of the app and the recipient can redeem the code in the Mac App Store\n\n", "Q: Remote control mac using ARD or teamviewer with password lock? I'm going to leave my main iMac in the office for a few days but I also need to access it remotely. \nCurrently I noticed I can only remotely access the mac with ARD or teamviewer if the iMac account wasn't locked. \nHow can I access the iMac remotely whilst still guaranteeing security to prevent unauthorized access from other sources. \nTeamViewer requires password to connect, so that's safe, but requires the iMac up and running and not locked.\n\nA: This isn't actually true. With ARD/Screen Sharing, you can leave the mac logged-out, authenticate when you connect with ARD, and then log in to your user account after connecting.\nYou just need to make sure the Mac isn't set to go to sleep when no one is logged in.\nWith TeamViewer, you would need to have the account logged in, but it should still be accessible if you have the account locked or using fast user switching. Those features allow an account to stay logged in, but prevent it from being used (physically or remotely) until authentication.\n", "Q: Can a VirtualBox Windows 7 virtual machine be installed on a USB hard disk? My MacBook Air has only a 64G hard drive which is so small that I don't want to install virtual machines on it. I'm planning to buy a 1TB portable USB hard disk to run virtual machines. Has anyone tried running a Windows 7 VirtualBox virtual machine on a USB3.0 hard drive with success? \n\nA: Yes, it's possible.\nFirst you need to create the virtual machine, after you completed the wizard don't start the VM but go to the menu Machine -> Show in Finder\nCopy the 3 files (VM Name.vbox, VM Name.vbox-prev, VM Name.vdi) to your external hard disk.\nAfter select the VM inside virtualbox and go to menu Machine -> Remove... and click the button Delete all files\nAfter go to menu Machine -> Add.. and select the VM file you copied before.\nNow the VM is inside virtualbox and runs from your external hard disk.\n", "Q: Is there any way to tell if someone is reading my iMessages? I think someone may be reading my iMessages on another device?  Is this possible?

Changing the password and reviewing the list of alternative phone numbers/email addresses associated with your AppleID should be enough to resolve that (assuming that your new password is significantly better than the old).\n", "Q: Any way on God's green earth to disable resuming applications after a crash? Using OS 10.6.8\nEvery month or two I'll have a hard crash on my MacBook Pro and I'll have to force reboot by holding down the power button. No big deal, I've been doing this on various macs since 1995 since OS version 7.1.\nWhat drives me absolutely bonkers in 10.6.x is that in certain cases like a hard power-cycle, OS X Snow Leopard insists on resuming all 20 or 30 applications I had running before the hard reboot.\nIs there some way to tell the OS just never ever ever (ever!) to resume my applications at boot time? I've done everything I can via system preferences and tinkertool of course.\nPlease help! It takes literally 20-30 minutes for my computer to get up and going in some cases (16 GB RAM, tons of applications running) and if this happens while I'm with a client it's incredibly embarrassing.\nI just want a fresh start. Do I have better options in 10.7+?\n\nA: Just to mention, 15 minutes to boot is way too much, no matter how many apps you have. I haven't seen that boot time since windows XP. 16 GB of ram and a slow hard drive may be your problem, so I'd consider an SSD which will speed your boot time up to 30 seconds.\nAlso make sure you don't have too many apps in your login items. Remove stuff you can start manually later when you need them. \nFinally make sure you have enough drive space, with 16 GB of ram, you need that amount of space to store the ram contents during suspend/resume and other operations. \nAnyway, in Lion (tho I recommend Mountain Lion instead) you can disable the Resume of applications straight from the System Preferences (and there are other tricks as well, easy to find).\nIf you are really going to switch to something other than Snow Leopard, I'd go Mountain Lion. I would venture and say Lion was the Windows Vista of the modern OS Xs :)\n", "Q: How can I restart an app game from the beginning I would like to restart two games, bubble safari and bubbleseason, from the beginning. When I delete the app and reinstall it from the App Store all my old data is on there and I start from the same level I left it at, I want to start all over from scratch.  Is this possible?\n\nA: Deleting the game from iOS devices usually removes the game stored data, unless, those data are stored in iCloud. Here are the steps to delete saved games data in iCloud.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you’ve deleted the games you want to reset. Some of those games will push the local saved data to iCloud even if you’ve deleted the data in iCloud.\n\n*Access those saved games data in Setting > iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage.\n\n*Select Show All to view all the saved data. You’ll see non-games app in this location too because it shows all your iCloud storage.\n\n*Tap on the games you want to reset.\n\n*Tap Edit at the top right.\n\n*Tap Delete All to delete the saved games data.\n\n\nA: You might have to delete all the saved game data. It might take a while, but the most thorough approach is to search the entire computer if you don't know where this data coudl be saved. Therefore open a terminal and type\nsudo find / -name \"yourgame\" -print\n\nAnd delete all the files that are showing up if you think that these might relate to the saved game status.\nEDIT: I didn't see that you were looking for a solution on iOS. In this case you should be able to delete the app with it's associated data in iTunes on your Mac. It should work if you delete the app from your iTunes library\n\n", "Q: Wake on demand no more working I was using Wake on Demand (not WOL) to access my mac remotely.\nI was able to turn in on from LAN or internet through SSH, VNC or HTTP.\nThe problems came when I upgraded to Mountain Lion. \nInitially It was working for a small amount of time after the computer was set to sleep: after about half an hour it wouldn't turn on.\nThen, a few weeks later, as soon as it went to sleep there was no way to wake it up. I recently upgraded to Mavericks with the hope that it would have solved the problem but nothing has changed.\nI tried all the possible solutions in this article but nothing helped me. In the last updates there are some workarounds but those are not what I want: they are simply keeping the mac on with the screen off, not sleeping.\nIs there anyone who managed to use the real wake on demand after Mountain Lion?\nThank you.\nUpdate:\nToday, after the update 10.9.2, wake on demand suddenly started working again.\n\nA: \nToday, after the update 10.9.2, wake on demand suddenly started working again.\n\nIt appears this problem has been solved for the questioner by upgrading to OS X 10.9.2. \nThis appears to be a widely reported problem but no obvious cause or answers are documented.\n", "Q: AirPrint and Apple Configurator I have a small office setup where I control certain functionality of a set of iPads. One of the things I need to do is to be able to allow a set of iPads to AirPrint, while keeping others from doing the same. Is there a way through either the Apple Configurator, or the iPhone Configuration Utility, to disable AirPrint by device?\n\nA: What I ended up doing was to implement Printopia Pro, which incorporates user groups. This has the effect of locking down the printers except for the users who need access. If you own Printopia, you can get $20 off on an upgrade to Pro. If you need permission-based printing like I do, I'd recommend doing so.\n\nA: It's not exactly what you are looking for but why don't you set a password.\nLook here: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11450?viewlocale=en_US.\nYou can share a printer and specify a user so who tries to print must enter a username and a password.\n\nA: It's a bit hackey but if your router supports it, you can whitelist only the traffic from the permitted MAC addresses to the printer.  The printer would probably still show up in the AirPrint menu, but wouldn't actually be usable by those blacklisted.\n", "Q: Wired keyboard for iPad Mini Is there any wired keyboard-case available for new iPad Mini (thefore using Lightning port)? Or keyboard-case with standard USB cable, that has been tested and proven to work with Lightning OTG Adapter? Does anyone have any experience in this area to share?\nI did a really good (as I think) research on this in the Internet, but all I've found is a really big bunch of wireless Bluetooth-based keyboard-cases for iPad Mini. Plus some entries that only suggest that a wired keyboard-case should work.\nI don't like the entire idea of charging keyboard aside of charging iPad itself. So the best solution for me would be either keyboard-case with Lightning cable or keyboard-case with standard USB plug, proven to work with iPad Mini through OTG adapter.\nThank you in advance for any help here.\n\nA: Nope, it won't work. Apple disabled the functionality a while ago with an iOS update. It only worked for few months on the first iPad with the Camera connection kit.\nI tested it on my iPad 2. If I remember well, when connecting an Apple USB keyboard it poped a message that said the connector can't provide enough power ... Probably a fake reason because it worked before. \n", "Q: Is it possible to use a Verizon CDMA iPhone 4 with any other carrier or Pay-Per-Use carrier? This is probably seems like a FAQ but I haven't seen anything definitive as of today. \nI have a CDMA-Only Verizon iPhone 4 (not a 4S) that recently came off contract. I'm aware that it's CDMA only and GSM carriers like AT&T can do nothing with it other than admire it as a thick iPod Touch. I'd like to explore options, mostly to lower my bill (I have no vendetta against Verizon, it's purely a cost issue).\nSo, network wise, are there any networks I can port to? I don't think Verizon has a MVNO in the Chicago area. Other than frequencies, is there anything I need to do to check compatibility with another network?\nAs far as unlocking, do I need to jailbreak my phone to change carriers? Or is this something Verizon will do (since it's off contract). \nIf I need to jailbreak, is it a permanent jailbreak, or is it possible to change a couple settings and then I can revert back to tracking current iOS?\nAre there any US carriers that can use the phone? Cricket seems to restrict it's network to Cricket-sold phones. Can Straight-Talk handle it? Virgin?\n\nA: Not likely unless Verizon agrees to release that phone for another carrier. Have a look at this guide on identifying iPhone models:\n\n\n*\n\n*Identifying iPhone models\nThe iPhone 4 you have is model A1349 (that should be printed on the back of the device), and if so, it is a pure CDMA phone so you cannot connect it to a GSM carrier due to differing radio technology.\nEven if you were to jailbreak it or get Verizon to unlock it, it's only going to work with another CDMA carrier.\nSo in the USA - you need to find a carrier with coverage in CDMA EV-DO Rev. A (800, 1900 MHz) and that's primarily Sprint and Verizon. Since there is no SIM card in this device, you might not need to get it unlocked, but that will be a dialog between you and your potential carrier if they can provide coverage to it at the same time as Verizon may have it registered as \"their locked device\"\nDue to bilateral roaming agreements - each CDMA tower in the US can and does serve multiple carrier devices - so it's likely that Verizon could prevent you from using your device on a competing carrier until you fulfilled your contract or convinced them to release that device's status in the common database for cell phones.\nThere are well over 50 regional and national carriers providing CDMA coverage according to this wikipedia article so you might have considerable options in some regions of the US. \nNore some of the information is old due to consolidation. Your main bets are C Spire, Sprint and Verizon.\n\nA: As far as I can remember, Verizon uses CDMA networks (as opposed to everyone else on GSM). You can identify your phone model by looking at this Apple chart.\nIf the serial number of your iPhone 4 starts with A1349, then your phone is CDMA and no \"big\" network will accept it other than Verizon. But not all is really lost.\nAT&T and T-Mobile (and Europe for the matter) use variants of GSM which is not compatible with CDMA. \nSo if your phone is CDMA, the answer to your question is: Only Verizon can use it (it doesn't have a SIM card as far as I can remember). (This is not 100% accurate).\nNow, will Verizon unlock it? Possibly if it's off-contract but I'm not sure how they work. AT&T would do it.\nJailbreaking the phone won't (as far as I know) give you much, because the problem is not in the software, it's the hardware. The communication through CMDA uses different frequencies than those of GSM. \nNow, the truth is, that there are other companies (depending where you live) that will use the Verizon Network (these are called tier-2 or tier-3 companies) and are usually local smaller companies that \"rent\" the big guys network (and pay them for that!).\nThese smaller services are usually more flexible because they are small and more efficient. You named Straight-Talk which is a good example because they lease Verizon's network and should have CDMA. You might want to talk to them to see if they can help you with this.\n\nA: Just call H2O wireless, they will connect you in minutes, 80 minutes for $10.00 which is their minimum;  it is a pay as you go service, however they have other plans as well, no jailbreaking or unlocking is necessary, happy talking!!!\n\nA: I just called Straight Talk and they told me that I could not activate my Verizon iPhone 4S on their network. \n\nA: I use Straight Talk with my Verizon CDMA iPhone 4, and works great.\n\nA: So, since someone tracked me down to ask what we did, I figured I'd post a followup. I won't accept this as an answer since we're not really satisfied with it - it's just the best option for now.\nWe decided to choose (drumroll) Verizon!\nIn the time that I posted that and the time we decided to switch, Verizon created a smartphone pre-pay plan. No Verizon compatible, BYOD MVNO exists in my area (I tried StraightTalk, they currently don't accept the phone, not sure why not). \nOur choice is good, not great. \nGOOD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Well, same network, same service, same network quality. \n\n*Much cheaper month on month, we save around $45 or so (though I still drool at some other, cheaper plans)\n\n*No phone number porting hassles.\n\n\nBAD:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is obviously a lower tier plan. Can you say Price Discrimination? I knew you could.\n\n*Related to Price Discrimination above, this is 3G only. Irrelevant for our iPhone 4 discussion, but may affect people looking for CDMA options.\n\n*Every call has the \"The time available for this call is _\" with 99.9999999999% of those calls being \"Unlimited\". Please just drop the message unless it's billed by minute.\n\n*No visual voicemail. This sucks. Back to calling *86 to check.\n\n*EDIT: update to iOS7 fixed this, though still buggy on message counts some times. No visual indication of any voicemail. We've been to the store a couple times, and they can't fix it. Even updated from iOS 5 to iOS 6 (this is a iPhone 4, so no real advantage there) and didn't work. We just. figure (for now) check after every missed call\n\n*You lose access to your current myVerizon account, need to make a new, much less useful account. \n\n*Billing on myVerizon is impossible to see what they charged you for. Is this overage because of roaming (we went to Canada for a trip), is this one because of data overage? Hell if I can tell.\n\n*Billing also has weird timings. One bill told us our minutes exired on the 20th, the 22nd, and the 24th. We never figured out when they really did expire.\n\n\nIn short, it helps to save 45 or so a month, but you don't get the same service. On balance worth it for us.\n\nA: Try Page Plus Cellular, no problem transferring a verizon iphone 4 to page plus as long as it has a clean ESN / MEID. Page Plus Cellular is a Verizon MVNO and uses the Verizon Network. I have activated 4 iPhone4's (plural, not 4s) that were originally Verizon phones. The activation process was painless and you can get a variety of pre-paid (purchase minutes) or plans (starts at $12/month). For example I'm paying $29.95 / month for 1200 minutes talk, 3000 messages (txt and multimedia) and 250MB data.  Unfortunately Verizon owns the WiFi Hot Spot app and its not available for use on MVNOs.  I don't know if any third-party WiFi aps or hacks are available or may be available in the future.\n", "Q: Hotkey to scroll other window without switching to it Emacs has a nice feature in the C-M-v keybind (scroll-other-window in Emacs Lisp), which causes the other window in a frame with two windows to scroll (I haven't tried it with more than two windows) without switching to the other window. Is there a way to get equivalent functionality with Mac OS X toplevel windows (i.e. non-Emacs windows)?\nIn particular I'm interested in scrolling Chrome and iTerm windows, but a more general solution would be great. I assume I would have to install a hotkey app of some sort, but I'm not averse to that.\n\nA: I don't know any way to get the second frontmost application or window with AppleScript, apart from something like this:\ndelay 0.3 -- time to release modifier keys if the script is run with a shortcut\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set p to process 1 where it is frontmost\n    set visible of p to false\n    delay 0.01\n    key code 121 -- 121 = page down, 116 = page up\n    set frontmost of p to true\nend tell\n\nIt makes the hidden and activated windows flash though.\nWith browsers you could use window.scrollBy():\ntell application \"Safari\" to tell document 1\n    do JavaScript \"window.scrollBy(0,(window.innerHeight-20))\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to tell active tab of window 1\n    execute javascript \"window.scrollBy(0,(window.innerHeight-20))\"\nend tell\n\nAnother option would be to simulate pressing ⌃F4, page up or page down, and ⌃⇧F4 by for example using KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, ModifierFlag::FN | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::F4, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::PAGEUP, KeyCode::F4, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, ModifierFlag::FN | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::F4, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::PAGEDOWN, KeyCode::F4, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n\nIt also causes a visual glitch, and ⌃F4 sometimes selects windows from hidden applications.\n\nA: I've discovered BetterTouchTool can send arbitrary keys to a certain application, so I set it up to send Page Up and Page Down to Chrome. It doesn't seem to be as general as I'd like (i.e. it can't just send events to the last-selected app; and it can't send actual swipe events to it), but it'll certainly do.\n", "Q: OS X Server: Wiki embed youtube video on page On OS X server using the wiki feature, I want to embed a youtube.com video onto a page.

We are most often using our home WPA2 Personal Wi-Fi, but oftentimes one or both of us are connected to our college's WPA2 Enterprise Wi-Fi.\nWhat is the best way to completely control her Mac from a different network? I have tried LogMeIn but found it rather bloated and full of features I never used.\nI am also a bit of an Apple software nut, and accomplishing this task using only Apple software is preferred. Optimally, I would like to be able to simply hit Command + K and connect to a VNC server, not having to install anything, but I'm not exactly well-versed in that process; is it even possible?\n\nA: In order to control another Mac you'll need to go to 'Apple Menu -> System Preferences...' on the Mac you want to control and enable 'Remote Management'.\nIn the 'Allow access for' section of 'Remote Mangement' you can leave the default selection of 'All Users', which will allow any account on the controlled Mac to be used to login for remote management or you can select 'Only these users' and define specific accounts that can be used.\nClick 'Options...' to define what remote management actions are allowed. You'll probably only need to select 'Observe' and 'Control'.\nIf you're both on the same network then you can do a Command + K from the controller Mac and type vnc://mygirlfriendsmac or vnc://ipaddress to connect to the Mac you want to control.\nRegarding the issue with controlling a Mac on a different network, this is where things can get complicated since there are a lot of variables depending on what network the Mac you want to control is on. This is one possible solution:\nFirst, you'll need to know if port 5900 is open on the network the Mac to be controlled is on. A lot of firewalls block this port. (You can do a VNC tunnel on port 80, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.)\nIf port 5900 is open then you'll need to know the publicly accessible IP address of the Mac to be controlled. One way to do this is to use http://DynDNS.com.\nThis is how DynDNS works:\nYou can signup for a free account that allows you to create a DNS entry that you define (ie- mygirlfriendsmac.dyndns-ip.com). You'll then need to install the DynDNS app on the Mac you want to control. This app will send the public IP address to DynDNS every few minutes so that you'll be able to do a Command-K on your Mac and connect to the DNS entry you defined (mygirlfriendsmac.dyndns-ip.com) and you can be assured it will be mapped to the current IP address of the Mac you want to control.\n\nA: There are lots of different ways to connect from a different network to her Mac, but if you're wanting to use only Apple software, the easiest way is to connect using Messages (Buddies | Share My Screen With... or Ask to Share..., depending upon whose screen is being shared.\n\nA: Free and easy is to use the same iCloud account and enable \"Back to my Mac\" on the one that needs to accept an inbound request to share it's screen with the \"support\" Mac. \nThis works as long as you are on a Mac that has not yet been updated to Mojave. Back to My Mac has now been discontinued by Apple.  \nThe setup is covered in this article:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: Using and troubleshooting Back to My Mac with your iCloud account\nThere also is a nice PDF with pictures for downloading here.

For this I need to increase the canvas size of the image: Just make the image larger, but without scaling the existing contents (which the Adjust Size tool seems to insist on doing).\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: One option would be to Cut and paste using ⌘-ALT-X and ⌘V after resizing the canvas size in destination file. The pasted image doesn't seem to get snapped to canvas edges now.\nIncreasing canvas size by cropping doesn't seem to be possible.\n\nA: This works well for me: \n\n\n*\n\n*Select all (cmd+A) and cut (cmd+X) the image from its canvas (convert to png if asked). \n\n*Resize the image as desired from the \"Tools\" menu (unlock the proportions if desired)\n\n*Re-paste original image from the clipboard (cmd+V) and move it where you want it on the resized canvas\n\n*Use cmd+- if necessary to zoom out (you'll see checkerboard where the canvas is and white beyond)\n\n*Paste in other images, etc, as you like\n\nA: The best method I have found is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a screenshot that is larger than your image you are working on, I usually take a shot of an empty text document so that it is entirely white. \n\n*Paste your image onto the new image, and then add your other pasted image as well.\n\n*Select the new combination image and copy it and make a final image by creating a new one from the clipboard. \nThis method only works if your two or more images are smaller than your screenshot image, but it works 95% of the time for me.\n\nA: OK, not saying this is the greatest, and still experimenting with it, but you can use the built-in sips terminal app if you know how big the image has to be and you are tolerant of cosmetics.\nI took a screenshot, test.001.png of this page.\n\nBut now I want to stretch it a bit to add some more space to cut and paste stuff.\nsips test.001.png -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth\n.../test.001.png\n  pixelHeight: 174\n  pixelWidth: 950\n\nso, it's 174x950 and I want to make give more vertical space.\n(I did not have to query the size info, but I found I would always underestimate it (it's based the mac's native pixel resolution), so kept on truncating it instead).\nsips test.001.png --padToHeightWidth 1000 950 --out test.002.stretched.png\n\nand then I later pasted something else to give you an idea of the result.\nif you don't specify an --out argument, it modifies the file directly rather than copying it.\nThere are some offset-type parameters to sips, maybe there is a way to put the original image top left?  In any case, you can cut and paste it to move it where you want it.\n\n", "Q: Can you play Clash of Clans using the same Apple ID? Me and my brother want to play Clash of Clans with different game progress but somehow he always gets my progress when he plays it.\nHe got a new Apple ID and a new Game Center, but somehow the same problem is happening: we can't play the game separately - we tried and tried but it still doesn't work.\nWhat can we do to play the game using different progress?\n\nA: This game saves progress to Game Center. If you both use the same AppleID for Game Center to log in, that would explain what you are seeing.\n\nA: Yes you can, but village is on your game center acc, so you must change your game center account and the game will start from zero.\n", "Q: Sub-divide the home screen iPad I recently got hold of an iPad and was wondering if it is possible to have home screen dividers like if I want to label first row of the home-screen as email, second row as blog posts similar to\n\nAny help?\n\nA: No, that's not possible. iOS will reorganize the apps and folders from the top left to bottom right automatically.\nReorganising your apps and folders on a per-page basis is the closest you can get: 1st page \"Main\", second page \"Games\", third page \"iCrap\", and so on.\n\nA: Slightly different, but you could also create folders for each of these categories. This gives you an area of the home screen that you can tap to open up each \"container\" like you have in the picture above. \n", "Q: How do you diagnose why a keyboard shortcut does not work? I am trying to get Command+Alt+Shift+L to work in RStudio on OSX. I have a large number of customisations that might possibly prevent this shortcut from working. I've gone through the usual places (e.g., system preferences - keyboard; Alfred; Better Touch tool). Thus, I thought there might be some more general procedure for working out what program, if any, is intercepting the shortcut\nIs there a way of seeing what program might be intercepting a particular keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: There is app called KeyCue that will help you find the keyboard shortcuts in use by your system.\n\nIt is shareware.\nMore info and to download : http://www.ergonis.com/products/keycue/\n", "Q: How can I make screenshots be true pixels? It seems like all my screenshots end up being twice as many pixels as they should even though I run the screen in 1920x1200. If I screenshot this editing box, via command + shift + 4 it says about 600px across, but the screenshot ends up being about 1200px. See:\n\nHow can I remedy this?\n\nA: This is to be expected, as your Retina MBP has an actual pixel resolution of 3840x2400.\nYou can downscale your screenshots manually, or use an app like RetinaCapture, which takes a full-sized and a downscaled screenshot at the same time.\n", "Q: How to use Aquamacs on a non US keyboard? I occasionaly use Aquamacs on my Macbook Pro. I have also bought an Apple keyboard with a US english layout, because it is not practical to program on a Mac with a french (or more generally probably any non english) layout. These characters { } | \\ ~ [ ] are not even on the keyboard, and you have to use various combinations of meta keys to get them.\nOf course it doesn't work well when you need: M-\\ , because typing backslash already requires meta keys.\nSo, how do you use Emacs on a non english keyboard, if that is even possible ? \nI could switch the built-in keyboard layout to english, but that's not really comfortable to use it for a long time. I do it when I have no other choices, for example when at some point I need a lot of braces, but that's just temporary.\n\nA: In Aquamacs check the Options->Option,Commands,Meta keys menu. It allows you to switch the key bindings of the various meta keys. I have the same issue with the Swiss German keyboard and using M-; to toggle Meta/Alt behavior helps a lot.\n\nA: You could use Ukelele to modify the US layout to make French characters easier to access. For example add them under caps lock and then add something like this to private.xml in KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK, Option::KEYTOKEY_AFTER_KEYUP, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK</autogen>\nPass-Through CapsLock LED status disables the caps lock light on some keyboards.\n\n\n*\n\n*To apply changes to a keylayout, you currently have to for example run sudo touch /Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts/ and log out and back in.\n\n*Keyboard layouts in ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ can't be selected in password dialogs or the login screen, but ones in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ can.\n\n*XML keylayout files don't work with the popovers shown when holding keys, but keylayout bundles do.\n\n*The default input sources can be removed by editing ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist.\n\n", "Q: Canon imageclass MF4420w printer cant work with mac osx 10.8 There seems to be no legit drivers available for the Canon MF4420w imageclass printers which dont seem to work.\n\nA: That happens with Canon but also with HP printers as far i know\nYour printer is not from this world! :)\nWhat I mean by that it is not supported on USA sites.\nBut the good news is it is supported on Asian sites.\nSo go here and get your driver.\n\nhttp://support-asia.canon-asia.com/P/search?model=imageCLASS+MF4420w&menu=download&filter=0&tagname=g_os\n", "Q: Disable oscillating light on MacBook Pro when in sleep mode This is not the same question as Can I disable the lighted Apple logo on the back of my MacBook Pro?\nWhen I shut the lid of my macbook pro, it goes into sleep mode.  When it is in sleep mode, there is a small oscillating white light on the front of it.\n\nThat small pill-capsule-like shape on the long metal strip glows forever on end when in sleep mode.  Is there any way to disable this while keeping the computer in sleep mode?\n\nA: Yes.\nPut a piece of cardboard in front.\nI have tested and approved this solution.\nAs far as I know, this is the only non-destructive solution.\n\nA: On the model shown your best bet is to disconnect the light from inside the case. Also depending on the model, you may lose the IR receiver and battery level indicator as well.\nOr if you don't want to disconnect the cable, you could have a physical barrier - some aluminum tape (actual aluminum, not grey/silver plastic) when cut to shape should stick there for some time and blend in somewhat better than other tapes.\n\nA: Keep the lid open so the ambient light sensors get a reading. They will adjust the brightness accordingly in a dark room but not completely turn it off.\nChanging power management setting from sleep to hibernation (suspend to disk) should turn it off completely at the cost of having to wait for writing the sleepimage file when closing and reading it into memory when waking up.\n\nA: the best and the safest solution is to use deep sleep widget https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/status/deepsleep.html\n", "Q: How can you manage permissions about which users can Add/Modify other users? I know in the unix world, if you wanted to be granular about whether a user could modify user accounts, you can specify whether they can sudo the useradd usermod commands. \nI am not just looking for the answer \"just make them an Admin user\", because basically I want the following :\nUser Andy   , has all admin privileges \nUser Betty , has all admin privileges, except for removing Andy as an Admin user.\nReferences\n[1] Best practice for installing applications for multiple users? \n\nA: This isn't possible on OS X.\nAn admin user is root. All admin users are root, if they know how to do something or get into terminal, they can do anything.\nYou might need to set up Server or pick a tool to do this. My favorite tool for situations where you need to give users the ability to do admin things and have them be non-admin users is to deploy JAMF's Casper suite.\nIf your time isn't valued high and you don't mind re-inventing the wheel, you could use a tool like munki to re-implement a set of tools that allow limited sudo items and wrap it in your own authentication layer to reduce the chance of allowing true Admin access, but I've never seen a case where it's cheaper to really set this up than to purchase a tool designed for exactly this use case.\nYou can still avail yourself of the sudo commands, but if you let a user be an admin privilege - they can and will have full run of the GUI versions of the tools that can create, destroy users (as well as modify the sudo files).\n", "Q: Why does Apple's website not make extensive use of CSS3 fonts? Ever since Steve Jobs published his Thoughts on Flash, I've always seen Apple as advocators of open web standards. Scrolling halfway down the What is Safari page seems to confirm this notion.\nSo, why does Apple overwhelmingly use images for their headers? For example,\n\nand on Retina displays,\n\nWouldn't it make sense, with respect to both open web standards and page load time, to instead link to the fonts in a CSS file?\n\nA: Apple has been notably touchy about 3rd-Party use of their fonts in the past and I'm inclined to say they still are.  Apple use to include a few fonts in OS 8, for example, which had Apple-copyrighted design.  You had access to them in that anything that specifically used that font rendered correctly, but if you wanted to be able to select the font in a text document, you had to jump through some hoops and enable it manually.\nThe font in question is almost definitely Myriad Pro or an Apple derivative.  You \"must\" purchase a license to use it commercially.\nWhile I generally agree with your assessment of using CSS3 fonts, it seems that Apple may be more concerned with copyright.  Load time differences are probably negligible for most people accessing the Apple site.  I'm sure they have people in Marketing looking at that data.\n", "Q: What is the maximum resolution for a second monitor attached to a MBP Retina? I'm curious if my new machine will support (for example) 3840x2400 retina-quality external monitor in additional to the built-in screen or whether that will exceed the capacity of the video card.\n\nA: From the Tech Specs page over at Apple:\n13\":\n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, at millions of colors\n\n15\":\n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, at millions of colors\n\n\nA: I don't have any direct experience with this so YMMV, but some research suggests that the maximum supported total resolution of Thunderbolt is 3840 x 2400 WQUXGA @ 60Hz.\nIn regards to the graphics card question, it is unlikely your graphics card will be substantially stressed unless you are pushing a videogame.  Working in the UI and document editing should be fine.\nReference\n\nA: Thanks @da4!

What are options to play FLAC files and have playlists on OSX? I've not seen a way to make iTunes play them natively, songbird looks terrible with retina display and same goes for clementine.\nI just switched to osx from linux and I was hoping I wouldnt have to go back to CMUS. \n\nA: I hope you have a secondary storage solution for FLAC audio files. I do :). I understand the allure of FLAC, I do everything I can to get my media in FLAC or at least some lossless format that I archive. There are a lot of benefits to keeping lossless files around, but playing them via any conventional player is (in my own opinion, of course) not one of them.\nI use Max to convert my FLAC files to Variable 256Kbit AAC audio.\n\nOnce that's done, I archive the FLAC files elsewhere, and import the converted files into iTunes. Sweet, compatible, bliss.\n\nA: Apartment Therapy has a decent roundup of non-iTunes music players for OS X. Unfortunately they don't seem to be updated terribly often, so you may not have much luck finding any with Retina support. iTunes' prevalence sort of crushes the rest of the market for music players, so the options are fairly limited.\nAn alternative would be to use X Lossless Decoder to convert from FLAC to Apple Lossless, which would allow you to use iTunes (not to mention any other Apple device). The beauty of lossless formats is of course that you can convert without any degradation, so why not take advantage of that?\n\nA: I use VLC. It's free, supports a long-list of file formats (including FLAC), has a decent interface and will allow you to create playlists.\nThis is a list of currently supported file formats:\nVLC playback Features\n\nA: Although it isn't updated much I'm using Cog.\nMore specifically a nighty build.\nI find it very stable, simple and refreshing when you compare it to iTunes.\n\nA: I think you should consider using ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) instead of FLAC. If you convert your tunes to ALAC you will be able to play them in iTunes. \nThere are lot on converters in the web.\n\nA: Vox is a great little player !!\n\nA: FLACTunes is probably the simplest way to get your FLAC files into iTunes by converting them to Apple Lossless.\n", "Q: Why does Apple's website break with 2o7.net blocked?

See:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=15336051&postcount=8 \n\nA: There are no shipping adapters that take a HDMI / DVI / Display Port signal and capture that video and send it back out over Thunderbolt directly to an Apple Thunderbolt display. There certainly weren't any in existence July 2012 when that item was posted to MacRumors.\nIt's most likely that the reports are confusing the existence of many TB -> other adapters that are ubiquitous and relatively inexpensive.\nSince we are finally seeing video capture devices that use Thunderbolt for the ingest to the Mac (as opposed to pumping out video over Thunderbolt to a Thunderbolt display) it might be some more months or even years before something like you ask gets released. Of course, I could be totally wrong and someone will release one tomorrow.\nI would explain things as follows: it's very easy and requires no expensive tools to take flour, water, and yeast and make bread. It's an entirely different situation if you want to start with bread and make flour, water and yeast. The analogy is slightly strained since you are just feeding one digital video signal and looking to extract/process it into another format of digital video signal, but at present, only a very expensive video capture console is capable of doing what you ask.\nThe cheapest working solution I can come up with would be the following convoluted processing path:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac sends video out Mini DP out \n\n*to an adapter for mDP to HDMI\n\n*to Black Magic\n\n*plugged into to a Mac with a Thunderbolt monitor\n\n*feeding live video into Video Processing software on the Mac\n\n*that the graphics card would then show in the Thunderbolt display.\n\n\nThis makes no sense. You'd sooner sell your iMac and just buy a Thunderbolt iMac. If you were OK with a networked solution, you could also run AirDisplay software on the Thunderbolt Mac and send your iMac's video over the network to the second Mac, but that wouldn't be as low latency as the above convoluted solution and still involves two Macs.\n\nA: I think this is a duplicate of these two questions:\nCan a Non-Thunderbolt device (like a mid 2010 iMac) connect to a Thunderbolt Display?\nAre there adapters to use Thunderbolt Display with non-Thunderbolt computers?\n\nA: I think the best solution at the moment for you is to get a video capture device like this one: http://www.elgato.com/video/video-capture  in order for you to view content on your imac.

Resending.\" My 2011 iMac running Lion recently developed a new problem; the mouse cursor stutters. At random intervals when I move the mouse it lags, then jumps, like it missed a couple of frames. Ordinarily I'd blame my wireless mouse or system load or something, but the Console has this very useful note in it:\n4/8/13 11:25:28.000 AM kernel: IOHIDSystem cursor update overdue. Resending.\n4/8/13 11:25:28.000 AM kernel: IOHIDSystem cursor update overdue. Resending.\n4/8/13 11:25:29.000 AM kernel: IOHIDSystem cursor update overdue. Resending.\n4/8/13 11:25:30.000 AM kernel: IOHIDSystem cursor update overdue. Resending.\n\nThat suggests to me something is wrong with the rendering system, not the input hardware. \nI've done some searches on this error and have found the usual superstitious-user suggestions for fixing the problem but nothing that seems to address how computers actually work. This writeup on StackOverflow is good but the question was closed before any answers came in.\nRebooting fixes the problem. The problem occurs even if the system hasn't been to sleep since a reboot. My system is unloaded, I have fresh batteries and a reliable wireless mouse. Problem also occurs with a wired mouse.\nUpdate some of the research I've done suggests this problem is symptomatic of the kernel being busy and not servicing interrupts fast enough. I don't know how to verify that explanation or find the cause of the kernel problem if there is one.\n\nA: This is more of a comment adding data, but I'm not yet permitted to comment, so this will have to do:\nI'm seeing this several times a day since getting my imac back from the shop with a new hard disk and Lion install, followed by a time machine restore.  I also upgraded the machine to 32G of ram after it came back.  When it occurs, the kernel_task in top goes to 95%.  The problem goes away after a minute or two without a reboot or other action.  There does not seem to be any disk activity, and I've tried replugging most of the USB devices since \"IOHID\" sounds like a USB thing, though I don't know that is the case.  That didn't seem to make a difference however.\n\nA: Your notes are fantastic and I hope that I can help in a small way. If the kernel is timing out and/or causing other processes to time out then it might be time for a re-install. \nI agree that your mice are least likely to be the cause of your troubles but the OS remains a big suspect in my eyes. \nI recommend going into the Mac App Store and under purchases redownloading Lion. This will automatically download the latest version (10.7.5)... For the time being stay away from 10.9 if you are truly looking for a resolution to the problem. Maybe consider 10.9 if the issue remains but best wait until 10.9.2 or so.\n", "Q: How to find cause of repeated reboots? I have been having issues with my mid-2009 Mac Pro ever since I installed Mountain Lion. First it was intermittent kernel panics;  I did some research and found that this is an ML bug that's triggered by having multiple Nvidia GeForce 120 video cards. Nothing I can do about that but wait for Apple to fix it.\nThen I started coming to my desk in the morning to find the computer shut down.  I could tell from the logs that it happened around 6:00 am, but I could not tell why - the messages just before the crash were different every time, and usually were not error messages.\nThe only thing I know of that runs in the wee hours of the morning is my SuperDuper! backups, so I commented all of those out in crontab.

The only things I can think of that run automagically are Dropbox sync, Backblaze and Time Machine, but those run several times a day, and it seems unlikely that they would only cause a reboot at a specific time of day.\nI tried to run the Apple Hardware Test but was unsuccessful.  Holding down D while the computer boots does nothing, and neither does option-D. I even switched from wireless to an Ethernet cable and running the test from the Internet still did not work (by which I mean the system just boots normally, with a slight delay which is presumably when it's looking for the test).  I do have a wired keyboard so it should be getting the keystroke at the appropriate time.\nWhat else can I do to track this down?\n\nA: You can look up what is going on at the specific time by using Console.\nUtility/Console\nAlso look up under the tab Diagnostic and Usage messages.\n\n\nA: crontab is legacy unix and is not the preferred facility for running scheduled tasks. This means you are not seeing all the background daemons that actually being run in your system. So you have a lot more checking to do. Below I give a brief description OS X's preferred facility for running scheduled tasks.\nIn OS X scheduled tasks are managed by launchd. There are two types of launchd tasks: LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents. Both LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents are configured in .plist files. You use the launchctl command to install, uninstall, start, stop, etc daemons and agents. Read the man pages for for both launchd and launchctl for info on how to use these tools.\nLaunchDaemons start running at system boot. They are system-global in that they are user-independent. They are stored in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/, and /Library/LaunchDaemons/. \nLaunchAgents start running at user login. They come in two flavors: system-global and per-user. They are stored in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/, /Library/LaunchAgents/ and ~/Library/LaunchAgents/. \nEDIT\nIn the .plist file defining a daemon or agent there's more than one way to specify the time at which the daemon/agent should run. Your question suggests the culprit starts at ~6:00 AM. You will likely want to check the StartCalendarInterval property in each .plist file. Read the man page for launchd.plist to learn more about scheduling daemons/agents. \n\nA: I looked at the many things being launched and was overwhelmed.  But eventually I narrowed it down to something that runs while I'm logged in, and that led me to look at my login items. Somehow a bunch of them got duplicated.  I cleaned up the list, and the reboots stopped.  This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but I'm thankful to have it solved.\n", "Q: Jumbled block instead of mouse pointer in login window This jumbled block to the left of my login screen is my mouse pointer:\n\nI've lost the little arrow.\nI'm having trouble determining what the cause could be.

I think it was never larger than about 4 times the size of the normal pointer\nMy guess would be it is not the data display cable.  It's hard to imagine anything that could go wrong with a cable that would affect only the mouse pointer.  I have zero experience with any Thunderbolt display, which might have enough 'intelligence' to do so.  \nI was usually able to figure out where the 'hot spot' of the pointer was.  Even though the cursor image was jumbled, there was still a point somewhere in the jumble at which clicking the mouse registered in whatever was being pointed at.  I would move the cursor to the corners of the screen, which gave me clues to where clicks would go.  This might be more difficult with your quite large jumbled pointer.  \nI would suggest trying to get the computer to refresh the mouse pointer, to 'overwrite' the jumbled block and restore the little arrow.  From the login window (as you have it pictured), pressing the return key or the enter key normally hides the arrow cursor until you move the pointer again.  If you can log in by providing the password, that may refresh the mouse pointer.  \nIf that doesn't work, and you have a blinking vertical line in the password field, pressing the 'esc' key should return the login window to the choice of users, and should get the computer to try to switch from the text pointer to the arrow pointer.  \nIf you have another computer on the local network, you could try accessing the desktop using Screen Sharing, which does some sleight of hand to get the cursors to match up on both screens.  This should also take the display cable out of the equation.  \n", "Q: Saving Photos in iPhoto to a flashdrive or other device I would like to back up my photos from my iPhoto Library (right now, I have about 8,000) and all I have available at the moment is a 10G flash drive. \nEventually, I would like to buy an external hard drive to save them to, but that is just not feasible at the moment.

Backup old file\n    $sudo cp /System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext/Contents/MacOS/IOAHCIBlockStorage\n/System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext/Contents/MacOS/IOAHCIBlockStorage.original\n\n##2.

This patch is reset on system updates, so it might be a good idea to keep the app however.\n\n\nA: OCZ SSDs use a Sandforce controller which has built in foreground garbage collection that delays the need to erase blocks, reducing but not removing the need for TRIM support. Trim can be considered an aid to garbage collection.\nTrim VS Garbage Collection\n\nFor the short explanation flash memory is organized in groups of pages where data can be written. Once a page is written, it cannot be rewritten until it is erased. But a page can only be erased within a group of typically 128 pages called a block. The complexity of writing data really starts to escalate in the case of random writes replacing previously written data. Random writes put the new data in previously erased pages elsewhere, peppering a block of valid data with “patches of invalid data.” In order to write new data to these patches, the whole block – all 128 pages – must be erased. But first all surrounding pages with valid data must be read and then rewritten to blank pages. The newly erased block of blank pages is then ready to save new data.\n[…]\n  All NAND Flash-based SSDs use GC. Some use foreground GC and some use background or idle-time GC. The difference between them is covered in my blog http://blog.lsi.com/dont-let-ssds-throw-away-your-gold/ . In simple terms background garbage collection will increase write amplification (WA) and wear out the SSD sooner. Foreground GC is harder to achieve and I believe only the SandForce controller is able to do it today\n[…]\n  TRIM is beneficial to all SSDs regardless of what kind of garbage collection is used. I talk about how TRIM came into existence and why it is necessary in my blog http://blog.lsi.com/did-you-know-hdds-do-not-have-a-del… . The TRIM command is sent by the OS to the SSD to identify what pages of data can be ignored during garbage collection. The SSD cannot tell what files have been deleted until the OS uses the same sectors to store new files, but by that time the SSD has already wasted cycles by garbage collecting data that was invalid, but known to the SS.\n\nDid you know HDDs do not have a Delete command? That is why SSDs need TRIM\n\nKeeping your SSD TRIM\n  A number of years ago, the storage industry got together and developed a solution between the OS and the SSD by creating a new SATA command called TRIM. It is not a command that forces the SSD to immediately erase data like some people believe. Actually the TRIM command can be thought of as a message from the OS about what previously used addresses on the SSD are no longer holding valid data. The SSD takes those addresses and updates its own internal map of its flash memory to mark those locations as invalid. With this information, the SSD no longer moves that invalid data during the GC process, eliminating wasted time rewriting invalid data to new flash pages. It also reduces the number of write cycles on the flash, increasing the SSDs endurance. Another benefit of the TRIM command is that more space is available for dynamic OP.\n\n", "Q: What's the noticeable speed difference between these two Mac computers?

Would this affect iMessage/iCloud in Mountain Lion? It worked in Lion despite this. Sadly I am out of AppleCare coverage, but maybe a Genius would see the fault is Apple's and re-serialize the board.\n\nA: The serial number may be an issue. When MacOSX thinks it is running on dodgy (i.e. non-Apple) hardware it usually has far more severe problems. There's no lockdown of an installation of MacOSX to a particular Mac, i.e. no DRM with keys and mandated validation with the vendor as with Windows. Apple cares most about people buying hardware, so the only \"piracy\" of MacOSX that they interfere with in code is running it on non-Apple hardware. But since my first version of this, I have been pointed at http://www.apple.com/support/icloud/contact/ by someone too polite to call m stupid in public, and that has strong sign of iCloud/SN linkage. \nThere's nowhere near enough info in the question to provide a sure answer to your problem, but there are clues pointing to possible issues. To figure it out, you should start by shutting off Little Snitch and the built-in firewall. You probably will want them back on eventually, but they should be off while you are trying to get complex services working to assure that they are not able to cause secondary blockage. And because you mentioned it, you get a rant: NEVER add entries to /private/etc/hosts on a modern MacOSX except for the 4 that the system needs for proper loopback initialization at boot time: IPv4 localhost and broadcasthost plus 2 forms of IPv6 localhost. if you have anything else in there, you should remove it. Once you've eliminated the possibility that your system config is explicitly blocking communication, you can look to the outside. All of those services include mechanisms to set up direct connections between 2 machines that may have IP addresses which are temporary and/or may be behind a NAT gateway that translates their traffic between a public and private (unroutable) address. Unfortunately, it is also possible for external network devices like routers and firewalls anywhere between the two ends to thwart those mechanisms. If you are behind a tight firewall, you will have trouble. If you are behind 2 layers of NAT, you will have trouble. Knowing what trouble you have isn't going to be discernible with toys like the Little Snitch network monitor, since the error you're getting probably involves just a handful of packets rather than any ongoing flow. To know what's happening you'd need to use a tool like tcpdump or wireshark and have an understanding of what you're looking at and looking for. \n", "Q: How many fans does a 2.26 GHz 15\" 2009 MacBook Pro 5,5 have?

Is it feasible to purchase an iPhone 3GS for telephony and skype? I'm thinking about getting an iPhone for a friend whose vision is decaying because of the possibility of making it display large text.\nHowever, the budget is very tight, buying a new iPhone is out of the question. She needs only basic services: telephony, the occasional text message, and Skype.\nWould a used iPhone 3GS make sense for this? According to GSMArena, the 3GS is still supported by iOS up to version 6, which (so I understand) makes Skype compatibility no problem. Is there anything else that might speak against getting her this 4-years-old model?\n\nA: If you are thinking of doing video Skype then you better go with the iPhone 4 as the 3GS doesn't have a forward facing second camera. \nThe iPhone 3GS will likely be somewhat sluggish (depending on what you are used to), but it does go to iOS 6, and is a great phone - especially for calling and texting (although I have seen the keyboard be sluggish, which wouldn't be a problem if they were typing slow).\n", "Q: Change default shell from bash to zsh I've tried to switch my default shell to zsh, using chsh:\nchsh -s /bin/zsh\n\nand:\nchsh -s `which zsh` \n\nBoth commands ended with:\nChanging shell for adamatan.\nPassword for adamatan:\nchsh: Operation is not supported by the directory node.

I have installed Windows7 by bootcamp on my Macbook, however, every time when I want to switch to Windows, I have to reboot the machine completely. That means I cannot keep my current workspace when next time I switch back to OSX.\nIf you use the Mac's hibernate function by the terminal, you don't even have the chance to choose which system to boot from, it immediately wakes up OSX. Sometimes, that's really a pain.\nBack to the days of Windows, we used the hibernate function to switch between systems without losing your current workspace. Is there an alternative way to achieve it on Mac?\nPS: \nI can not use a virtual machine solution, because it has some hardware disadvantages. Such as the development of Kinect can't work through VM environment.\n\nA: OS X does not natively hibernate like Windows.\nFor maximum effectiveness, apply both of these methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFIt.\n\n*Start Terminal \n\n*Run /efi/refit/enable.sh\n\n*Put the Mac to deep sleep.\n\n*When you power up the Mac, the efi menu will appear and you are able to select to boot OS X or Bootcamp.\n\n\nBut, since you have Mac hardware, you should be able to VM OSX.\n\nSecondly, you can try pmset.

I'd like to create a test user in iTunes Connect, so I can test in-app purchases. However, iTunes forces me to enter credit card information. Considering this is a test user, for a sandbox environment, that is not supposed to be spending any money, it looks pointless. Is there any way around it? (I know that it is possible to create a new account with no payment option, but then it won't be considered as a test user.)\n\nA: OK, as it turns out the test user can only be used from within the sandbox environment, which makes certain sense.

I have a MacBook (Retina, Mid 2012 if it's relevant) which I installed Mountain Lion onto, creating one user account only (an Admin account). There is a Guest User, marked for \"Sharing Only\". The hard drive was encrypted with FileVault 2 at the time of install, and the recovery key stored away.\nFor various reasons the password to my user account was disclosed (but NOT the FileVault recovery key). I changed the password on my user account before it could be used, but the old password is still known.\nIs the old password still retained with respect to the FileVault partition, and might enable someone to decrypt the FileVault-encrypted drive? Put another way, are my new password and the recovery key the only way to decrypt the FileVault partition?\n\nA: Once you change the password, it has been charged and the old password can not access the FileVault decryption protocol. It would be nightmarish if you had to always remember any and all passwords ever used by the FileVault account(s). \nIf you want really great info to FileVault please watch: http://docs.macsysadmin.se/2013/video/Day2Session5.mp4\n\nA: You need a current working password for your filevaulted system. Anyone who has access to such can unlock the file system. The recovery key will always be the emergency key when you forget your passcode. Think of that as your key under the rug at your house. Safely store that so you can gain access in the worst case scenario. Remember if you enabled the option when you activated filevault to store ur recovery key with apple, they can access that for you if you lose it. If you are worried the FEDS are getting into your encrypted hard drive. well you might as well say bye bye. \nHere is a good site to read about how it works and what it does:\nhttp://afp548.com/2012/06/05/filevault-2-the-silent-protector/\n*Edit\nAlso read this, \n\"When FileVault is turned on, guest users can only log in and use Safari. Guests can’t access your FileVault-encrypted disk or create files. Instead, they log in and use Safari from your computer’s built-in recovery disk.\" support.apple.com/kb/PH11321\nGuest account boots in a different partition that does not have access to the encrypted partition\nThe question your asking is confusing:\nThe password to unlock the encrypted drive is whatever your password is to login to your user account. I don't understand your problem. If you changed your user account password. Use the new user account password to unlock the system-or recovery key if necessary.

I downloaded and installed Java 7 update 17, and the installer reported that everything was a-ok. Clearly, that was something of lie.\nNow, when I try to check my Java version on http://java.com/en/download/testjava.jsp, it says that \"An old version of Java has been detected on your system\".

As evidenced by running java -version JRE 1.6 is the default JRE on your system.  You likely want to change the default JRE to Oracle's 1.7 JRE.  \nYou are correct in that there used to be a System Preference for setting the default JRE. Apple removed that as part of the Java Mac OS X 2012-006 update. The new way for selecting the default JRE is to use the /usr/libexec/java_home command. Read the java_home man page as well as the Determining the Default Version of the JDK section of this Oracle page for more info on how to specify the default JRE.  \n", "Q: Is there a way to create new desktop spaces from keyboard only? We all know there is a way to to switch between desktops using keyboard shortcuts, \nbut can we create new ones using only the keyboard?\n\nA: You can do it with some AppleScript.

You'd still need to use the mouse/trackpad to drag a window to the (+) desktop thumbnail in the top-right corner (or just click on it) to create a new space.\n", "Q: How effective is Itunes \"error correction\" for CD imports? I have not been able to find out how the Itunes \"error correction\" option works. There are more effective programs out there for bit perfect rips but I prefer the speed and ease of use of Itunes. Does anyone know how this error correction works and how effective it is at getting quality rips from scratched CDs?\n\nA: Besides the raw audio data, CDs come with error correction codes, which, usually, are not read, assuming the data integrity. This leads to the typical poping or clicking sound heard when the CD has any defects, such as scratches, fingerprints or even manufacturing defects.\nBy turning on Use Error Correction, iTunes will read and process these error correcting codes along with the audio samples, correcting any found errors.\nThese error codes are called Reed-Solomon and this Wikipedia's extract explains how it works:\n\nIn the CD, two layers of Reed–Solomon coding separated by a 28-way convolutional interleaver yields a scheme called Cross-Interleaved Reed Solomon Coding (CIRC). The first element of a CIRC decoder is a relatively weak inner (32,28) Reed–Solomon code, shortened from a (255,251) code with 8-bit symbols. This code can correct up to 2 byte errors per 32-byte block. More importantly, it flags as erasures any uncorrectable blocks, i.e., blocks with more than 2 byte errors. The decoded 28-byte blocks, with erasure indications, are then spread by the deinterleaver to different blocks of the (28,24) outer code. Thanks to the deinterleaving, an erased 28-byte block from the inner code becomes a single erased byte in each of 28 outer code blocks. The outer code easily corrects this, since it can handle up to 4 such erasures per block.\nThe result is a CIRC that can completely correct error bursts up to 4000 bits, or about 2.5 mm on the disc surface. This code is so strong that most CD playback errors are almost certainly caused by tracking errors that cause the laser to jump track, not by uncorrectable error bursts.\n\n", "Q: is there a way to make my device look like it was never jailbroken I had jailbroken my ipod touch and then restored it so it is no longer jailbroken and I was wondering if there is a way to make my ipod look like it was never jailbroken so apple can not tell because I heard that even if your device is not currently jailbroken apple can still tell and will not fix it if anything goes wrong. \n\nA: If your iPod has been completely restored with the original software, then there's no way to tell. A jailbreak just means replacing the software with hacked software - there are no other (physical) side effects or whatever you're fearing.\n\nA: In theory they could technically tell that you jailbroke but in simple terms as user kba stated. If you preform a full restore while in DFU mode you should be just fine! I never had an issue getting replacement iPhones after erasing the phone entirely. Jailbreaking writes and manipulates files on the iPhone leaving it on the memory. Erasing the memory as you should know does not necessarily mean it erases and zero outs existing data. Thus creating the potential if apple really wanted to..to dig deep and find evidence of such data.\n*also they could checkout jailbreak devs TSS center that houses iOS SHSH. Thus backing the case this person had an intent to be jailbroken LOL\n", "Q: Find and remove all photos below a certain size threshhold So, I had a relative's hard drive collapse, and I've used photorec to look for the most obvious files to retain (fortunately they only had pictures on the computer, everything else was cloud-synced, such as email) so I now have a parent-folder with 208 subfolders of all the PNG and JPG files from the old drive. Obviously a lot will be either \"OS and Application images\" (toolbars, sample images, thumbnails, system caches) and some will be \"family photos\".\nIf I can find some way to find all below a certain size (preferably say 300px wide) then sorting the rest should * be easy. \nHow can I use iPhoto or Spotlight or something to do this automatically? I'm also open to scripts using easily installed (brew perhaps?) libraries, if a script of some sort can be pointed to.\n* famous last words\n\nA: You can use the terminal to do this. The following command should work:\nfind /path/to/the/folder \\\n  -name \"*.jpg\" \\\n  -exec bash -c \"sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth {} | grep -E ' [12]?[0-9]{0,2}$' >/dev/null\" \\;\\\n  -print \n\nThat command will find all JPEG files under /path/to/the/folder which have a width or a height of between 1 and 299 pixels.\nReplace /path/to/the/folder with the actual path to your folder.\nYou can change \"*.jpg\" to \"*.gif\" to find GIF files instead.\nYou can change [12]?[0-9]{0,2} to change the size of the pictures you wish to locate. For example, to find pictures smaller than 500 pixels, use [1234]?[0-9]{0,2}\nIf you want to review which pictures this command finds, use:\nfind /path/to/the/folder \\\n  -name \"*.jpg\" \\\n  -exec bash -c \"sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth {} | grep -E ' [12]?[0-9]{0,2}$' >/dev/null\" \\; \\\n  -exec mv {} /path/to/some/other/folder \\; \n\nReplace path/to/some/other/folder with the folder you want the files moved to, and that command will move the files it finds there.\n\nThe way this works is as follows:\nThe sips command is the scriptable image processing system. The terminal command sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth some.jpg will print out the width and height of the JPEG file.\nThe find command, as one might expect, finds files. -exec passed to find tells find to execute the specified command and only return files for which the command returns a successful result.\nThe command bash -c \"sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth {} | grep -E ' [12]?[0-9]{0,2}$' invokes a shell, runs sips to get the image size, and then runs grep, which searches text, asking grep to search for either a 1 or a 2 followed by between zero and two digits (0 through 9). This is a regular expression, and it matches the numbers (strings) 1 through 299\n\nA: In Aperture you can do this. And More!\nStep 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Import all files into Aperture.\n\n*Use list view.\n\n*Click on an image size criteria to sort by that criteria.

The TV Genres and Movie Genres are similar but each row is a different genre.\n", "Q: Automatic reflow of icons in Finder while resizing window? Is there any way to enable automatic reflow of icons in Finder while resizing the window?\nOne constantly has to to resort via \"clean up by ...\" after resize.\nI've yet to find a piece of software that handles that ridiculous shortcoming of Finder.\n\nA: You can go to Finder>View>Arrange By>Name.\nIt'll resize in real time if you do that. \n\nA: If you change your \"arrange by\" options via \"right click\" > \"arrange by\" to any other than \"none\" spaces between the icons is clinched/stretched according to window size, or icons even get rearranged to the next line if space gets to narrow.\nThis should be default behaviour without \"arrange by\" since it kind of breaks list view if active. Sadly Apple rarely listens to customer needs, since they \"know what the customer wants\".\n\nA: In macOS 12.5.1:\nWith the folder open in finder, right-click in the blank space. Then go to Sort By, and select any option except None or Snap to Grid.\n", "Q: \"# is not registered with iMessage\" error Let me clearly establish that I am not trying to send a sms to a non-iPhone user. On my OS x Mountain Lion macbook pro I was sending iMessages from the Messages application just fine until all of a sudden my Messages application is claiming that all of my iPhone-using contacts are not actually iPhone-using contacts. On my iPhone my messages are being sent and received just fine, it is the computer I am typing this on that has the issue. \nI floated through the apple forums and saw a few suggestions - signing in and out in Messages(tried and could sign in fine but my application still thinks it's everyone else with the problem), checking to see that my macbook still knows its own serial number (it does), restarting my computer (no effect), and changing wifi networks (no effect). \nHas anyone else had this issue with their Messages app on their apple computing device and, if you have, how were you able to fix it? Did it vanish at random as suddenly as it appeared or are there some missing settings that I couldn't think of? \nThank you. \n\nA: I've got several contacts that are offline in iMessage and they have gone through all the troubleshooting steps.\nEverything points to this being a service disruption as opposed to something you or your contact has done wrong.\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\n", "Q: GitHub-Style Collaborative iTunes Backup? Alright, here's a funny question. I'm a DJ, and I use iTunes locally on my MacBook Air for my music. I also have my backup hard drive, to which I have copied my iTunes library to as the master storage. This backup of the iTunes folder is separate from the Time Machine Backups on the same disk.\nI'd like to have just a select number of songs available on my machine (with it's wonderful, adorable 256GB SSD and all) and the entirety of my library on the external drive. When I get new music, I want to be able to add it to the iTunes library on the master disk so that everything is up to date. The reason for this is so that my fellow DJ can access that hard-drive with her own MacBook Pro to pull from the pool of music, and add to it with her own purchases.\nNow, I realize that iTunes allows me to download songs I have previously purchased to my machine. This means I can pull purchases my assistant has made onto my local machine (and vice versa), and then also save them onto the master storage.\nMy real question is this: is there a way to succinctly sync the iTunes folder Time-Machine-style outside of the typical Time Machine backup location? I suppose it would work a bit like GitHub: there would be a central \"repo\" which all of the master changes are synced, and my assistant and I can pull what we need from it and add new songs to it, keeping the master storage up to date with every song we own.\nThe cumbersome way to do this would be to manually drag all of the new purchases into the iTunes Media folder when we buy them. There must be an easier way to do this! We want one big master library that we can easily sync to and pull from. Any cool way to do this?\n(P.S. I am a programmer, so any sort of geeky or programmatic way to do this is heartily invited!)\n\nA: Sounds like you want to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have your itunes music stored to an external hard drive on download\n\n*Have a subset of the music locally on your laptop\n\n*Have a centralized repo, where your fellow DJ(s) can access the music\n\n\nThere are a few problems with a simple rsync between your external drive and their drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*m4a rights managed files won't play on your friend's laptop without you granting their laptop access\n\n*as files are played, some meta data on the files are updated to reflect plays, likes, etc.\n\n\nHaving said that, you can work around the issues if you are willing to forego some of the meta information and if you are ok with authenticating your friends' laptop to use your music.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dedicated Mac Mini or Mac Laptop or Windows machine running iTunes, with the full library downloaded and shared via the normal Apple Airplay/Network share\n\n*Your laptop and your DJ friends' laptops can then view/browse/stream the music from the central box. Meta information preserved as well as no need to move a hard drive around, all music available from one central place.\n\n*You may need to authenticate your friends itunes to be able to play your rights managed music.\n\n\nThe external hard drive route is basically the same, except that you basically rsync from your mac mini/archive box to an external drive. Requirement to auth a DJ friend's laptop still applies. \nFor your laptop which has a subset, you would just choose the songs you want from your library and import them locally into your instance of iTunes.\nRe: Github style, probably not the best, since leveraging git would result in massive storage magnification anytime the play counter is updated/etc. Since the files are binary, diffs can't be stored. \n", "Q: file transfer from Tiger (10.4.11) to Mountain Lion (10.8) Will Migration Assistant let me transfer my files from my old Mac running Tiger 10.4.11 to Mountain Lion?  I've read that it does not support moving files from 10.4 to Mountain Lion and didn't know if the .11 on my version made a difference as to it working or not.\nAlso my old Mac only has USB 2 and firewire, new Mac USB3 and Thunderbolt.  So I don't know how I would make the connection.\nThanks.\n\nA: Do you have specific files you are transferring? Ie, your home account? If you put the old Mac into TARGET mode, you can use the ThunderBolt->FW800 adapter and a FW800->FW400 cable to mount your old Mac like an external drive and copy whatever you need over. The migration assistant may be able to read from the drive to pull data as well. \n\nA: Mountain Lion's Migration Assistant supports direct migration from 10.4.11 only on FireWire. Newer OS than Tiger allow Network Migration in addition to FireWire mode.\nSee http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4889 for details.\n", "Q: Using Mobile SIM card with an iPad Mini If I buy a Wifi and Cellular iPad Mini, could I cut down my mobile SIM card and use its cellular data with the iPad?\n\nA: A simple question but there is no simple answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to know the frequencies and protocols used by your carrier and ensure they are supported on your iPad. 3G is highly likely to be OK but it's not 100% (for exampled, much of T-Mobile's 3G network runs on a frequency that's not compatible with the current iPad/iPhone\n\n*As noted, you'll need to cut the card down to nano-SIM size.  If you screw it up, the SIM is toast and will need to be replaced. You'll also need an adapter if you want to put it back into the phone.\n\n*The iPad needs to be configured with the proper data/APN settings for your carrier.\n\n*Your carrier has to not care that you are doing it.  I've heard stories about carriers detecting that a phone SIM is being used in a tablet and disabling the SIM.\n", "Q: Why is the % saved only displayed for some refurbished products? I was browsing the listing for the refurbished iMacs and noticed that some of the items explicitly state how much is being saved while others do not.  While it is easy to calculate the savings yourself, I wondered if there was some underlying reason for this.\n\n\nA: I believe those entries for which percentages are not shown are build-to-order models. Of course there was an original retail price so there's no reason why the percentage saving isn't shown, but Apple has decided not to display it for some reason.\n", "Q: Install Mountain Lion to another drive without rebooting I'm wondering if its possible to install Mountain Lion to an external drive (connected via esata) without rebooting from the host system?\nI came across this hint suggesting that it was possible to do with Snow Leopard, but this method doesnt work with ML. \n\nA: Not really, but once you install a clean Mountain Lion system, you can image it to a DMG file and the clone it to your heart's content without rebooting the system doing the copying.\n", "Q: Replace a failed disk in a Disk Utility RAID 1 I have LaCie 2big thunderbolt 2-disk device configured as a RAID1 from Disk Utility. One of the drives appears as \"failed\", so I unmounted the raid, replaced the drive and plugged it all back in.\nNow Disk utility reports that one of the slices is missing from the RAID, and it shows my new disk separately on the list to the left.\nThe \"slices\", including the missing one, have a lock icon in front of them, and even after dragging my new disk to the list I can't rebuild the raid.\nHow do I rebuild the raid?\n\nA: I was unable to find how to rebuild the RAID from disk utility after a couple of hours of research. However, I managed to do it from the command line.\nsudo diskutil list  // to get a list of disks. Note the disk number of your new disk (e.g. disk4)\nsudo diskutil appleraid list // note the uuid of the raid in question\nsudo diskutil appleraid add member disk4 UUID-OF-YOUR-RAID\n\nIt will then kick you back to disk utility and start rebuilding the raid :)\nAlso, if the failed disk remains on the list, you can remove it:\ndiskutil appleraid remove UUID-OF-FAILED-DISK UUID-OF-RAID\n\n\nA: After plugged it all back in.\nDisk utility reports that one of the slices is missing from the RAID, and it shows new disk separately on the list to the left.\nYou need to delete the missing disk from the right side screen and then click demote.\nFrom the left side, drag and drop the new disk into the right then click on the new media and click rebuild.\n\nA: You may not actually have a failed drive.  If you had a power failure and you don't have all the external drives plugged into the UPS, external drives will be out of sync.  \nI have two 4 TB drives in my Mac Pro that are mirrored to a pair in external eSata enclosures.  Power went off, and I discovered that I had plugged into the 'filtered, but not UPS' plugins on the UPS.\nRebuilding a 4 TB drive takes time -- I have both rebuilds going right now, and it looks like it will be about 12 hours to do them all.\n", "Q: What process is in charge of the background image on Mac OS? I have a problem that occurs seemingly randomly on my Macbook Pro, 13\" 2010, running 10.7.  The background on the secondary screen (which is actually the laptop screen itself, the primary screen is a Cinema Display) will go gray.  I can still use the screen, it shows everything but the background image.  I can even drag desktop icons to that screen.  Changing the wallpaper does nothing.\nMost of the users in this discussion seem to be having a similar issue.\nI tried \"killAll Finder\" to see if I could get it to reset itself (it will fix itself after reboot).  Apparently, that process is not in charge of the background image, because the background stays while the desktop itself (file icons on the desktop) disappears while Finder is restarting.\nSo, is there a process I can try restarting that will reset the wallpaper state?\n\nA: The Dock process is responsible for Launchpad, Mission Control, the Dock and the Desktop Background.\n", "Q: can i put this ram into my imac 21.5 mid 2010 corsair cmso8gx3m2a1333c After installing computer wont boot up, just beeps. Uninstalled and put original 2x2gb samsung back in and computer booted up just fine.. Reinstalled the corsair and still nothing but beeping. Tried installing on top slots then on bottom slots. Computer tech at best buy assured me it would be compatiable with my iMAC\n\nA: A quick Google suggests that memory is two 4 GB SO-DIMM sticks of 1333 MHz DDR3, which matches the specs given by Apple and EveryMac.\nIt's possible that you've just got a couple bad sticks of RAM. I'd suggest testing them one at a time, rotating through the slots. If possible, test in another machine as well.\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 crashes when connecting to Exchange server The problem started this morning when Outlook 2011 tried to connect to the Exchange server looking for new emails. An error message came up saying that Outlook needs to close (see screenshot).\nI can open Outlook and switch to Offline Mode, then everything is fine, but as soon as I turn off offline mode and it tries to connect to Exchange, Outlook crashes again. It works fine for other people with the same setup.\nIs there anything I can do to analyze the issue? Rebuilding the identity is usually recommended in such cases, any other options?\n\n\nA: First, make sure that you're up-to-date with your Outlook updates.  The most recent version of Outlook is 14.3.2.\nOne relatively easy option would be to remove your Exchange account from Outlook, quit Outlook, quit the Database Daemon, and then launch Outlook and re-add your Exchange account.  Another option would be to create a new user account on your Mac and add your Exchange account to Outlook there.  In either case, this will tell you whether this is an issue with something on Exchange or if it's local to Outlook.\nThere are additional troubleshooting steps available in this Outlook:Mac KB article, but the steps above are where I would start because they're the easiest.\n", "Q: How can I designate a default email account in Apple Mail on Mountain Lion? Opening a new mail to compose currently defaults to the Cloud email.\nI want to change that default to my Gmail (set up already in Apple Mail).\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: The default mail is the first one in the list. So just move it up in the preferences. \n", "Q: OS X application manager Unix-sytled, \"package managers\" like Fink, Homebrew, and MacPorts do a good job of managing 'headless' libraries.

It also has ability to search for new applications based on your search terms and/or category. It's pretty good, but it is not all-inclusive.\nMacupdate Desktop is shareware that is similar to Bodega, but has no feature to uninstall applications as far as I know.\n", "Q: How to transfer Adobe licenses to another Mac A Power Mac just died at the office. We also have another one which died a couple of months ago. They both had Adobe software installed on them, and I need to transfer those licensees to other Macs.\nProblem is, most of these Macs were transferred from another office, so we don't have any disks or licensing information - except what's on the hard drive. I was told that the IT guy that was here before me managed to transfer licensees just by copying some files. So I scoured the hard drives and managed to find some stuff which resembles licensing information, but I was wondering whether there are any guides on how to do this.\nI would at least need the versions of the installed products, and their serial numbers. This information was requested by Adobe when I contacted them. I told them I would need to get that from the hard drives, but they weren't willing to help with that.\n\nA: have you tried to find out if you had technical support services for those Adobe softwares? if yes then you can ask them for the version and serial numbers. If you are a company and you have volume licensing the information you are looking for is registered in the Adobe services. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Local name changes every 10 - 20 minutes I have just bought a new MacBook Pro after my previous one died ( mother card seem to had been the problem). In this one like in my previous the computer's local hostname keeps telling me that the \"MacBookPro-BC-617.local\" is already in use on this network and changes the name of my MacBookPro-BC to 658.local. \nThis takes place every day and almost every 10 - 20 minutes. I'm using Mountain Lion. What could be causing this and how could I get rid of it?\n\nA: This happened to me at work when we were using individual wireless access points, each acting as a DHCP server: the MBP was, at different times, catching its signal from these different access points, depending on the location and the strength of the various signals. We changed to use a central DHCP server, and set the access points to extend an existing network, and it solved this problem, as well as a similar issue where the user would get messages that the IP address was already in use.\n", "Q: Why isn't my ipad saving videos I was emailed? I have an ipad mini and a freind recently emailed me a video.\nWhen I go into the corner and click save video it then does not appear in any of my photo albums.I have been trying for ages and it is very important at I save this video.\n\nA: Did you check in the Camera Roll? It isn't going to be in an album if you save it on your iphone from your iphone. \n\nA: Perhaps saving it differently will work for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap and hold on the video thumbnail (in the email message) that you would like to save.\n\n*Select \"Save to Camera Roll\".\n\n*Open Photos.app.\n\n*Select the \"Albums\" tab. \n\n*Select \"Camera Roll\".\n\n*The video should be the last one in there.\n\n\nIf this doesn't work, try sending the video to yourself. \n", "Q: Forcing the wifi password entry dialogue to display When the administrator of a wifi network changes the network password to something new, previously associated devices that have the old password saved will no longer be able to connect until they re-enter their wifi passwords. \nUnfortunately OSX handles this situation in quite an unpredictable way:\nWhatever happens seems to have to do with the network security protocol in use and also differ between vendors.

A pane will pop out, and in the list of tabs at the top, either Wi-Fi or AirPort will be selected (depending on OS X). This is the leftmost tab; if it isn’t, then click on it.\nYou should see a list of Preferred Networks. This is a list of all the wireless networks that your Mac knows about, and thinks that it knows passwords for. Select the network which has a changed password in the list, and press the little - button which is to the lower-left hand corner of the list.\nThen press OK in the lower-right hand corner of the pane, and then Apply in the lower-right hand corner of the System Preferences window.\nThis “forgets” the network. The next time you ask your Mac to connect to that network, it will see it as a new network and throw up a password prompt for you. Once you enter the new password, OS X will treat it as before (logging in and connecting automatically for you).\n\nA: The only two ways I have found so far are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Selecting \"Join Other Network...\" from the AirPort menu bar item, manually typing in the network name (can be quite tricky when the SSID contains foreign characters or whitespace), and manually selecting the correct security protocol\n\n*Turn wifi off, open Keychain Access, make sure you select \"all\" sources in the left pane, select Find, enter the network name, select all matching items from the list, Delete them (-may require authenticating as admin)\n\n\nNone of them are very user-frienly :-/\n\nA: I've found that forgetting the network sometimes won't help. The software that hotels seems to keep on treating the connection as already established. I've resorted to changing the MAC address (the unique hardware based ID) for my wifi ethernet interface.

As I often climb up walls and something like this the iPhone should be protected well. I found the Griffin Survivor, which is actually perfekt but very very thick... Is there an alternative to Griffin Survivor, which is protecting well (also the screen) but smaller?\n\nA: As you are aware, everything is a trade-off. Smaller case typically means less protection. Bigger usually equals more, obviously. \nWith that in mind, I have used an Otterbox, for rough going, and really like it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Otterbox Defender\nIt seems to be a solid build, and, although the rubber casing has gotten somewhat more loose over time, Otterbox does have a good warranty.\nNow, this next thing is no match for a pocket, and likely as big as the Survivor, but perhaps you would like it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Otterbox Armor\nIf you desire an even more minimalistic approach and would consider carrying the phone in a pocket you could always go with my all-time case favorite:\n\n\n*\n\n*An Otterbox Clearly Protected -> Viewing Vibrant Screen Protector\n\n*Speck Candyshell (or similar)\n\n\nThis setup doesn't have a belt clip, but the case feels very natural in your hand - so you don't lose the iPhone feel, but also don't give up too much protection. Note that the back of the case does scratch some, but most of that is aesthetics. And the screen protector is terrific.\n\nA: The ideal shell will be a custom molded, carbon fiber sleeve that you would drop the phone into (or similar thin case to totally enclose the device) and matching your desired level of bulk/strength ratio.\nThe larger a case, the more rigid it becomes, but at some point, it's too large for your preference.\nThat would be the smallest possibly package and you won't need to be looking at the device during parkour.\nIt would be the simplest to slide your phone into the case and you wouldn't have any trade off between clear case or one too large to fit in your pocket or backpack or wherever else you carry the phone. (I've seen runners tape the entire phone to their back or arm or leg and simply place the phone in a plastic bag for waterproofing.)\n\nA: I think the best one is the \"lifeproof\" case, is the one i use when i do parkour (shockproof), but is also waterproof, dirtproof, and snowproof, is an amazing, case, and is the thiner one that i have seen. \n", "Q: Is there a way to monitor what data is displayed on iPad/iPhone My company has an iPad/iPhone app which shows news, blogs, videos and various articles. This data is obtained from a rss feed. Additionally it also shows a lot of stock market data. My question is, is there a way to check if my application is displaying the information which matches exactly with the rss feed data? \nThe only way i can think of doing it, is to monitor all http calls going out from my iPad and garbing the response using tools such as Wireshark or charles, and then subsequently compare the http response with the rss feed. But this approach still does not handle the scenario \"what exactly is being displayed to the end user situations\"? \nIf i use the http monitoring approach, how would i go about comparing results on charles or Wireshark.\nAny ideas or suggestions? \n\nA: Rather than wireshark, try using a http proxy, like fiddler2.  Then save the Rss content to a file, and load it into a browser, like firefox.  Then you'll have to visually diff the two views of the RSS feed.\n", "Q: iTunes connect renewal will not allow iAd contract to complete because of a banking page bug!

When I create my own dmg-images, I always attach a software license agreement to them. When I opened the flattened image, I always got the Jaguar \"X\" in the background of the agreement dialog, where I have to confirm to the SLA before the image will be mounted. I believe that since Lion, apple removed that, so the eula-dialog is clean.\n\nIs it possible to set a custom image into the SLA-Dialog on Lion or later OS X?\n\nA: One easy way to create DMGs and play with every option is to use the popular DropDMG from Michael Tsai. It's not free, but he has great support and it's very communicative and there's a trial version.\nDisclaimer: I'm not affiliated with Michael Tsai, but I've known him (and his products) for a long time now, when I started using SpamSieve (another of his great products).\n\nA: I found out, that it is not possible – the \"X\" in the background is OS specific.\nThe last macOS version that showed it on mounting the image was Snow Leopard. All versions of macOS that followed after that did not use it anymore.\nHowever, you could use an image within the Textfield, since it represents an RTF-File Format.\n", "Q: Netboot Image - Where is the user generated data stored I have a OS X Lion Server hosting netboot images. I also have a 10.8 Server for creating 10.8 images, but am hosting all images from one 10.7 NetBoot server.\nWhen a client machine boots a specific net boot image, my understanding is that it copies at least the most necessary parts of the image via network and stores it somehow on its local resources.\nDoes it only store the data in the RAM or does it save data locally?\nWhere is newly generated session data stored? On the Server or locally ?\n\nA: When you NetBoot, the read-only NetBoot DMG file gets mounted read-write via the use of a Shadow File. Any Mac OS X DMG file can be mounted with a Shadow file. When a Shadow file is in use, any data which would be written to the DMG file is instead written to the Shadow file, and when data is read, the data will be read from the Shadow file first before the DMG file.\nWhen NetBooting, there are three kinds of images, each with three different methods of mounting the DMG and storing the Shadow file:\n\n\n*\n\n*NetInstall Images are made from a Mac OS X Installer DVD or an Installer Image downloaded from the App Store. They have no Shadow file, the root partition / is read only and there is no swap.\n\n*NetBoot Images are made using System Image Utility from an installed Mac OS X system. the Shadow file is stored on the first hard disk in the hidden /private/netboot folder\n\n*Diskless Netboot Images are the same as NetBoot Images but the Shadow file is stored over the network using Apple File Protocol (AFP)\n\n\nIn the case of Diskless Netboot (The most powerful), the Shadow file is stored in the NetBootClients0 folder of the Library/NetBoot folder on the server machine (Or NetBootClients1, NetBootClients2, etc, where the number matches the number of theNetBootSP` folder in which the Net Boot DMG resides)\nTo make a NetBoot image a Diskless Netboot Image, use the \"Make this image available for Diskless booting\" checkbox under the image settings in Server.app:\n\nYou also need to have AFP File Sharing enabled, and you need a guest writable sharepoint for the NetBoot directory. (I do not recall if Server.app creates this automatically) Apple has a document about troubleshooting Diskless NetBoot which is helpful. AFP548 also has some great hints\n\nWhen a client machine boots a specific net boot image, my understanding is that it copies at least the most necessary parts of the image via network and stores it somehow on its local resources\n\nThis is not technically correct. When you NetBoot, the Mac OS X Kernel mounts the root filesystem (/, the boot volume) over the network. So nothing is stored locally. When data needs to be read (E.G. an application is launched) it is read over the network, rather than from your hard drive. No data is copied from the server to the local machine.\nWhen changes are made, for example, a new file is saved, then the Mac OS X kernel needs to write those changes somewhere, and that's where the Shadow file comes in. As described above the Shadow file might be on the first local hard drive, but it might also be stored over the network. If it is stored over the network, then the Mac OS X client can actually unmount the drives and do things like running Disk Utility. It can even have the hard drives completely removed.\n\nA: By default, the NetBoot image is a read-only asset, so each client downloads enough of the image to boot.\nDuring boot, the OS Client makes a shadow file for local storage and changes.\nThose changes can be re-used the next time that Mac boots from the network. If the shadow file gets deleted, the boot process will re-create it if needed.\nThis only will be of use for describing the initial boot assets and changes made to the core system. You will also want to think through how user changes are being mounted, stored, captured and backed up.\nNetboot is great for troubleshooting and initial loading of an installer image. I've also seen it for loading a diagnostics suite or kiosk situations  when you simply start up a single app where all the data on a server or cloud and no real data lies ever on the client (think museums or digital signage). I suppose a motivated team could engineer a total solution where all the Macs net boot, but it's usually better to let each Mac run it's own OS and have other methods to audit, control, re-image things when needed.\n", "Q: Intermittently unresponsive keyboard and trackpad on Macbook Air Especially since the 10.8.3 update, I've been experiencing occasional freezes of my 2012 Macbook Air's trackpad and keyboard. The trackpad will be completely unresponsive, and usually only a few keystrokes will get through. Other people have complained that similar things happen after resuming from sleep, or that it takes a reboot to fix, but this happens randomly (it'll be working perfectly fine and then become unresponsive, then be fine 10 seconds later).\nI have no external USB devices connected, and nothing shows up in the system log at the relevant times. In addition, as has been suggested by others online, I've disabled the Android File Transfer helper process which apparently has caused similar issues for others.\nIt's still under warranty -- should I take this to the Apple Store, or perhaps try reinstalling the OS first? Will that be their first line of attack anyway, or do you think they'll be able to diagnose a hardware problem and fix/replace it?\n\nA: I would create a new user and see if the behavior happens under a new account, so you can isolate whether this is System Wide or just related to your own account. Check your Launch Items in system preferences and remove everything just to test. \nHow much free space do you have? For what is worth, I'm using a MBA 11' mid 2011 and I have the same behavior sometimes when Arq2 starts and I have IntelliJ + Xcode running. Like the CPU is under a lot of \"pressure\" and I totally experience the same. It lasts a few seconds (10 sometimes!).\nSo I doubt there's anything to do, unless this happens very often to you, in which case I'd take it to an Apple Store for either reinstall or some hardware check. \n\nA: Resetting the MacBooks power controller solved this for me:\nTo reset the SMC:\n1: Shut down the computer.\n2: Plug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your computer.\n3: On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\n4: Release all the keys and the power button at the same time. (You will see the status light on your charger change back and forth when you do this). \nDone: Press the power button to turn on the computer.\nWhy this fix makes sense/works:\nYou will notice that when this issue occurs if you close and reopen your MacBooks screen the issue solves itself for the moment, this is because doing so cycles the power. Aka why a full power reset as described above can solve the issue for good.\nRef: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201295\n(Also relevant if issue is occurring on MacBook Pro, or standard MacBook) \n\nA: Do you have a good deal of status bar icons/services? I found in my case, that one particular service had caused my trackpad/keyboard to be unresponsive(turned out to be the wifi service). Disabling it in the top menubar may help.\nIn the case of the other answer, about creating another user account, this would have a similar effect, as your various preferences are set to default, so there may not be a conflicting service/interface effect at play. \n\nA: have a look this! might lead to smth could be the answer! https://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=49254\nbesides in my case, the trick with another user didn't work...\ni am checking this method to solve the issue\n\nA: I have run into this problem multiple times.  I have spent hours debugging and reading through forums.  And unfortunately each time this happens I have to remember the most basic and simple way to solve this problem...  I have a magic mouse and it was switched on in my bag.  The mouse button was depressed which was causing my keyboard and trackpad to be non-responsive.  Turn off the magic mouse.\n", "Q: Time Machine error - The backup disk is not available - Using internal disk for TM I have an old Mac Pro that I would like to use as a Time Machine server for my small company. I just put in some spare hard drives in the unused bays, and set up a mirrored RAID set to use for Time Machine. I am able to use that RAID set as a Time Machine disk locally for that particular computer, but when I try to use it as a Time Machine disk for a networked computer, I get the error:\nTime Machine couldn't complete the backup to \"COMPUTER NAME\"\nThe backup disk is not available.\n\nHowever, I am able to connect to the disk using Cmd + K, or even just by browsing to it from Finder. Is this problem being caused by the fact that I'm using an \"internal\" disk as my backup disk?\nThe Time Machine computer is running a newly installed version of Lion (10.7.5) and the computers trying to back up to it are either running 10.7.5 or 10.8.3\nThanks\n\nA: If you are using the volume directly on the Mac and you are likewise sharing that root folder of that volume, then correct. The hidden time machine files would be problematic.\nIf you exported a sub-folder on that volume, and placed the necessary Time Machine control files in place, then you should be able to use the exported volume as a time machine volume over the network.\n", "Q: Can many iPads have a \"master\" Apple ID and a second, \"personal\" Apple ID? Our school district has many iPads.  We are wondering if a \"master\" Apple ID can be set up for configuing purposes (creating a standard starting point with certain apps for all devices) and if the teacher to whom it is assigned can then set up their own Apple ID (a second, functioning ID for the same device) for personal app downloads, email, calendar, etc while leaving the initial information intact.  Basically, we don't want them to be able to change what the IT dept puts on the iPad.\n\nA: The Apple Configurator app was designed for deploying large numbers of iOS devices within institutions like schools. The Apple Configurator documentation explains the three different supported configuration modes (Prepare, Supervise, or Assign), and a video introduction is also available. Based on the wording of your question, the either the Prepare or Supervise method will likely be the best choice.\n\nA: In addition to Apple Configurator, you may consider something for over the air management, such as Apple's Profile Manager, or Airwatch. \nFrom there you can deploy apps, and restrict installation, in-app purchasing and set content settings.\n", "Q: Sharing a Dropbox link directly to the clipboard, without having a browser pop open? Is there any solution for retrieving a Dropbox share link to a file, that doesn't involve opening a browser?\nThat puts it directly in the clipboard.\n(For sake of clarity, I'm referring to when you right-click a file and select Dropbox → Share Link.)\n\nA: No, you can't just get the link in clipboard, which is much safer for you. With Dropbox's version 2.0.5, you can easily share them through the toolbar.\nThere's a second way of doing it, being a lot better, which is:\nFinder > Dropbox > public (move your public file here) > right click > dropbox > Copy public Link \n\n\n\nA: Since September 2013 Dropbox introduced the possibility to automatically copy the public link of a shared screenshot to your clipboard.\nOn Mac you can use the default shortcuts Cmd+Shift+4 or Cmd+Shift+3 and the link is automaticlycopied to the clipboard.\nOn Windows you have to use Ctrl+Print Screen to get the link copied to the clipboard (If you just press Print Screen Dropbox will only add the Screenshot to the Screenshots folder).\n\nA: You can as of a couple of weeks ago.\n", "Q: How can I remap keys on a headless mac? At the moment I'm remotely accessing my mac via logmein.  I'm trying to remap Command to Control via system preferences.  However every time I try to do this it keeps resetting to the default.

I noticed a new machine on my network -- it's my next-door neighbor's Airport Extreme!\n\nMy network is set up with a WPA2 Personal password, and I don't believe that he's cracking passwords to steal my bandwidth.  My suspicion is that it's accidental.  I don't see any place in Airport Utility where I can say \"don't allow this network to be extended\".\nI'd like to know\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it actually possible that his Extreme is extending my network, even without having the password?\n\n*Is it possible for me to block it from doing so?\n\n*Is there any security flaw here that I should be worried about?  Or is this actually just preventing him from being able to connect via wifi (because it's all my network now)?\n\n\nA: After the neighbor and I spent some time going over our networks, we figured out the problem: we were both extending our home networks over the house power lines, and apparently the street power for our row houses doesn't provide much separation.\nThe HomePlug system, which is what both of our adapters conform to, allows you to set up encryption on the network traffic.  Not only does this keep things secure, it also keeps other networks from getting tangled.  However, both of us had gotten systems that default to no encryption and we'd blithely left them that way.  (Mine is a Netgear Powerline AV 500, my neighbor has some other manufacturer's)\nAs Thorbjørn suggested, the network graph that the Airport utility was showing was just a source of confusion.  Once we'd separated the HomePlug devices, everything went back to normal.\n", "Q: Can I share my iMac's internet to iPhone or iPad over USB? I have an iMac, connected to the Internet via Ethernet, and an iPhone 4. I would like to share the iMac's Internet connection to my iPhone via the USB Cable (because my wife dreams of a wifi-less household).\nI've set up Internet Sharing, specifying \"sharing from: Ethernet  via: USB IPhone\", but when I test, the iPhone cannot connect to the Internet. Is there something I need to activate on the iPhone? \niMac, mac os x version: Mountain Lion, 10.8.4\niPhone 4, IOS Version: 6.1\n\nA: Before iOS 10, the only method that existed would be possible with a jailbroken device as Apple didn’t offer this feature before then. \n\nA: It is possible by using Apple's development tool what is usually used to intercept app's traffic, but it also do iPhone→Mac→Internet tethering.\nRemote Packet Capture for iOS devices is about sniffing apps' traffic, but there is also easy step-by-step guide how to send traffic throught Mac. Just follow paragraphs between \"Remote Virtual Interfaces\" and \"Using tcpdump\" headers.\nIf command rvictl is missing in your computer, you probably need to install the command line tools included in Xcode.\n\nA: The method you described will share your Internet connection to your iPhone on recent Macs and iPhones. Specifically, on macOS Sierra, follow the instructions in the Apple Support Article, macOS Sierra: Share the Internet connection on your Mac but choose to share your Internet to computers using iPhone USB.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, open System Preferences and click on Sharing.\n\n*Enable Internet Sharing by clicking the checkbox.\n\n*In the Share your connection from pop-up menu, select Ethernet (or Thunderbolt Ethernet on MacBooks using the Thunderbolt-Ethernet adapter).\n\n*In the To computers using list, select iPhone USB.\n\nA: I can share my MacBook Pro's (macOS Sierra) wi-fi internet connection to my iPhone SE (iOS 10.3.3) without trouble. There's no special setting on the iPhone. Just turn off wi-fi on the phone and it automatically connects to the internet via a USB->Lightning cable to the MacBook Pro.\nI had no success with my old iPhone 4S, which could really benefit from internet sharing via USB because its wi-fi antenna periodically craps out, and I have to revive it with a hairdryer and freezer, which can be inconvenient, especially on the road.\n\nA: This works on macOS 10.12 and iOS 10 without needing a jailbreak or other app.\nLater macOS 10.13 enhanced this feature as part of asset caching and Apple Configurator 2 features for multiple iOS devices sharing the Mac network. This is out of the box support, built in to the OS with no extra first party apps or modifications needed.\nBefore iOS 10 and macOS 10.13, USB tethering only worked in one direction or for one device. Before macOS 10.12 - internet service used to flow out of iOS but not in to iOS from a Mac over USB.\n\nA: You used to be able to do Bluetooth PAN sharing to all iDevices. Now, it appears it works sporadically for iPad device only. Most iPhones are reported as not working. It was working at one point, and Genius Bar verified that it is no longer supported. Apple may view their icloud functionality as trumping and making computer-to-iDevice connections unnecessary.\n\nA: you can also share IMac Ethernet to Ipad/Iphone over an addtional Ethernet cable, but it requires second Ethernet port /Ethernet Switch, a powered USB Hub and an additional Ethernet Adapter, plus a standard micro/usb cable, as shown here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKp02y4JXVs\nNot very elegant, but functional. Blutooth Tethering works also, but mainly with Ipads and Android Devices.\n\nA: What you've described works for me (I'm sharing the Mac's Wi-Fi via USB iPhone). But it didn't work until I turned off both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data in my iPhone settings.\nWith Mobile Data turned off there's no indication in the top bar that anything is connected, but the internet is shared and works well!\nThis is using an M1 Macbook Air with macOS Big Sur, and iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 14.6.\n\nA: You may have to reboot your Mac. \nShare Ethernet via Wifi (do not tell your wife)\nWhen it works, the wifi icon on the Mac is a fan with an exclamation mark on it.\n\nA: Yes you can share your ethernet, usb dongle internet with your iphone/ipad devices.

I usually use Dropbox to get my epub files into iBooks. This works quite well when I only need to add one file at a time, but now I've received a collection of a few hundred epub files.\nI am really not used to iTunes, but from what I could gather the collection a book is part of (in iBooks) is not known/registered by iTunes.\nIf I add all these files to my iTunes library and start syncing to my ipad I fear my iBooks will get completely cluttered with the new files.  And manually sorting the files on the ipad seem like quite a cumbersome task.\nHow do I conveniently transfer those epub files from my computer onto my ipad straight into its own collection in iBooks?\nAll the new files can go into the same collection.\n\nA: You might not be happy with the current functionality of iTunes, but here's how to works. The folder structure from iBooks in iOS doesn't get reflected in iTunes, so you can't control which category new books will arrive in on the device.\nYou can have a folder of epub files and drag them into iTunes, but they go where iTunes puts them, not a folder of your choosing. This allows bulk injection of hundreds or thousands of books into management for syncing.\nThe computer version of iTunes will then make a copy of those files in it's Media folder and sync them to all iOS devices the next time they sync (assuming you have the sync rules to sync all Books to each device).\nNow, the good news is that if you go ahead and file a book in a category on your iOS device other than Books, that information does sync back to iTunes and the next sync will re-organize things on other devices so you file once, and then sync each device to get them all in sync.\nFurthermore, if you have a new iOS device (or erase an existing device) and push all books to that device. The folder status from the last device sync goes to that empty iBooks on iOS.\nIf and when Apple adds a control to iTunes, you may be able to order books on iTunes just like you can order App icons in iTunes and then sync the device to see the results.\n", "Q: MDM that can control wifi and bluetooth My boss just come up with an idea of having a mobile device management that can control the flow of data (access) from bluetooth and wifi to the iOS devices. \nI've actually configured a Profile Manager (mdm) on Lion Server in the past so I'm a little bit familiar with mdm but not sure with the bluetooth access.\nWhere can I start?\n\nA: BoxTone EMM does both.\n\nConfigure device security with dozens of policy controls including encrypt device, disable iCloud, disable camera/wifi/Bluetooth, enforce strong passcodes, etc\n\n\nA: You don't even need a MDM solution to set profiles that restrict bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The Apple Configurator can create these profiles and you can email them, post them through dropbox, upload them to a website, etc....\niOS will see those files and install them pretty much without hassle whether you use MDM to get them out or any other means that's convenient\nThe real art is in getting proficient on test devices how profiles work, when you want to prevent their removal and thinking through how you will set policy to not cause too much work but also lock things down in a reasonable manner.\n\nA: There are a lot of Mobile Device management (MDM) vendors providing the ability to control WiFi and Bluetooth network.

Specifically, when an app is using push notifications to send you advertisements/promotions, despite this being explicitly against Apple's rules.\nThe closest thing I've found is a form to report intellectual property violations, and I can't find anything else that's close.\n\n5.6 Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising,\n  promotions, or direct marketing of any kind.\n\nRecently, AppGratis was removed from the store for this (and other) violations.\nI'm stick and tired of one app in particular, Real Racing 3, sending me ads to 'buy' in-game cars. You need notifications turned on in the app because of other game-related mechanics, such as when a friend challenges you to a race or your car is repaired. There is no option I can find to opt-out of the advertising messages.\nContacting the developer (EA, FireMonkey) will do no good because they don't care, so I'm hoping if this gets the attention of Apple then they will enforce their own rule.\nOf course I just could remove the app and no longer use it, but it bugs me that small developers can't get away with it and big ones get a free pass.\n\nA: I was searching for \"voice changer\" software and three of the top results were apps that had thousands of 5 star ratings. Really?\nAfter reading some of the reviews, apparently these apps use the same technique to do ratings fraud. Basically they require users to rate them with 5 stars so that they can unlock more features, according to the actual verbiage in the reviews! That plus many of the reviews are obviously just generated text with non-sense English. Really?\nAfter some searching for ways to report rating fraud on the Apple App Store, I found a link the other Apple developers can use to report them. Sorry, it won't work for you if you are not an app store developer :(\nhttp://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=contactUs&contactfaq=fraudconcern \n\nA: Apple has implemented many changes in 2017 and 2018 time frame as the size of the store has grown. How you get support depends upon your relationship with Apple.\n\n\n*\n\n*As a consumer, you would report and ask for support based on purchases you make. As a developer, you have a dedicated channel to report rights violations, fraud, and general concerns.\n\n*The App Store is now much better where you can voice critical reviews and get feedback from the developer for all to see. If a major app is doing things that are surprising people, that shows very clearly in the reviews.\n\n\nBut really, unless there's something serious, why wouldn't you just disable notifications for that app, then open a support ticket with the vendor and maybe leave a bad review and delete the app? \nI would expect Apple support to show you how to delete the app and how to disable notifications and then hand you off to the developer if they aren't making you happy.\nIf you purchased the app recently (which should cover the vast majority of things that are blatantly wrong)\n\n\n*\n\n*http://reportaproblem.apple.com\nApple's report page directs you to the web page listed for support. Even this page is very carefully shaped to get Apple items like billing and subscriptions handled, but venting / reporting / tattling / complaining about an app isn't something Apple has a web page to receive feedback that's easy to find from the App Store apps or the general support pages.\nIf you are a developer, sign in and contact support: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/contact/#!/topic/select\n\nIn 2013 - the state of reporting issues was less formalized. The support was more case by case and reviews were one way (Developers couldn't respond to complaints at all, let alone publicly).\n\n\n*\n\n*You should send a message to the developer (since you are about to poo over their product on the App Store) - give them a chance to make things right since they might have a fix or be able to assist you directly. \n\n*Go into the App Store and rate the app. If you give them one star and a brief review - kill them with kindness: \"If only I could ignore the constant upselling of paid upgrades, I might have liked this game\"\n\n*Look hard at the description in the App Store. If they materially mis-represented the state of the app (say the screenshots are marketing illustrations and not actually screen shots) - report a problem with that purchase from within iTunes. Find that purchase and click the report a problem link. That fires a flag at that item in the store. You won't get a response, but I am confident that in bulk these are reviewed with the most reported problems getting the most scrutiny. That link may pop up a form to add details - if not, it will take you to the website below.\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/ - Find the section on contacting support and click it.\n\n*It takes you to another page - and you will want to submit your detailed feedback to Apple listing the app, the time/date of the violation and the section of the rules you feel are being violated.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this process, you may also want to take Apple's support survey and ask that they streamline the problem reporting process to make it more clear how / when users should be sending feedback to Apple. You can bet that once enough people start using the tools given and enough complain (politely and with detailed evidence) that it takes too long to report obvious problems with the review tools - it can be fixed.\nI do know that if/when your report gets to the desk of a developer support person, they will know how many steps you needed to take to get them the problem report and it's more likely they will dig into it if your complaint has merit.\nMost importantly, if you paid money for the app, consider asking for a refund. Detail why the app isn't as described or isn't following the norms you have seen Apple publish and how you feel bad for supporting both Apple and the developer financially when they don't follow the rules set down.\nA financial ramification, well reasoned complaints/criticism and using the tools Apple has given for consumers to rate apps together will send a clear signal that the business didn't do a good enough job selling a specific app to you. Once patterns of failures accumulate, they can't go un-noticed.\n\nA: I have the same problem with the otherwise very useful Mac app 'Memory Clean.' \nIt uses push notifications (on the Mac) to advertise the developer's other products. Furthermore, in System Preferences, Memory Clean doesn't even show up in the list of apps that are sending notifications — which means there's no way to stop it from doing so.\nThis is a multiple violation — for sending push notifications, purely to advertise other products; and for not giving the user a way to disable the notifications.\nRelevant TOS language:\n—> 5.3 Apps that send Push Notifications without first obtaining user consent will be rejected\n—> 5.5 Apps that use Push Notifications to send unsolicited messages, or for the purpose of phishing or spamming will be rejected\n—> 5.6 Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising, promotions, or direct marketing of any kind\nI contacted the developer, and my requests have been ignored. So, I actually called Apple customer support to report this, and the representative said I should talk to the developer. I told her that I already had, and she had no other recommendations.\nI can't believe that Apple has no official mechanism for reporting these flagrant violations.\nUpdate:\n@bmike: Thanks for the reply, but Memory Clean is a Mac app, not an iOS app. So, the link for reporting iTunes issues doesn't apply. It's also a free app, so requesting a refund wouldn't apply.\nStill, even free apps should obey the rules. But Memory Clean uses push notifications to nag users to buy the developer's other apps, and there's NO WAY even to REMOVE Memory Clean from Notification Center. The developer has designed it \"cleverly,\" so that it doesn't even appear in the list of items that can be added to or removed from Notification Center.\nI've contacted the developer numerous times -- and have been repeatedly ignored. I've even requested a paid version of the app. Also ignored.\n\nA: Go to this site: reportaproblem.apple.com\n\nA: I think you may need to think over it again.

If I submit one build for the US and a different build for the rest of the world, will Apple give me 2 separate app ids? I.e. if everything is the same (app name, etc.) except for the actual game code, do I get one app id for the US and another one for the rest of the world?\nThis is important for cross promotion purposes, because if I hardcode the link to my app in another app then I might need to do some geo segmentation to account for the different app ids, depending on where the users are located.\n\nA: No, you can't do this the way you're describing, only 1 build is allowed at a time for each app name and App ID. So obviously you can have different builds (v1, v1.1, v2, etc), but only one is live on the App Store at one time.\nTo solve your issue, you should look at having the code in your app handle the different locations (or language/Region Format) of each user.\nIt's generally thought that having different versions of the same app makes it more difficult to promote (which is why there are less Lite/Pro apps now, and more with the freemium approach with in in-app purchase to unlock more features), so having a single version of the app would also help here.\nI would also point you to the following two entry points that describe how to use app-id wildcards. \n\n\n*\n\n*App ID under iOS \n\n*the recently updated App Distribution Guide\nWithout getting too deep into the guts of how code signing works, there is truly no \"one size fits all\" answer since your marketing needs may override the extra work needed to properly localize one unified release.

No backup on Time Machine. How can I recover my files? I lent my hard drive to a friend and he has formatted it as he couldn't get his PC to recognise it. I have no Time Machine backUp. Is there any way of recovering this data?\n\nA: Yes you can recover a lot.\nFirst rule to take care of: don't mount the accidentally formatted disk as read/write\nHere is how to proceed. Open a Terminal or xterm window.\nIf your external disk is plugged, run diskutil list and identify from the last column the name of your external disk.\nLet's say it is damaged (in reality it will be something like disk1s0).\nUnmount it:\ndiskutil unmount /dev/damaged\n\nMount it back but read-only:\ndiskutil mount readOnly /dev/damaged\n\nFrom now on, your damaged external disk can't be corrupted by OS X\n(even root and Spotlight won't be able to write to it).\nMake a disk image of your damaged disk with Disk Utility,\nand try any software you want on this safe copy.\n\nA: First step, use a low level tool like dd to make an image of the drive as it exists now, and then stop using the drive. Every second that drive spends connected to a computer (especially a Mac) is a chance for something new to be written to it on top of data you want to recover. All of your recovery attempts should be performed on the image that you make.\nOnce you have that image, there are a lot of tools you can try to use. \nTestDisk can recover the partition table if that was overwritten. If you had multiple partitions, restoring the table will likely magically and immediately \"unformat\" all except the first one, because all their metadata will still be intact.\nThe next thing you want to try depends on the filesystem each (or the only) partition had. There are tools explicitly made for unformatting HFS+, various types of FAT, ext2, etc.\nIf that fails, or even if it doesn't, the final step is to use a tool that will search through the entire drive, sector by sector, and try to put files back together based on their headers. This is prone to failure in cases of fragmentation, but can often recover things that other methods cannot (including deleted files, fyi). I recommend PhotoRec. You might also try some of the Mac-specific tools covered in this article.\n", "Q: Sent emails not syncing properly When I send an email from my iPhone the sent email does not end up in the \"sent\" box on my Mac, in my mail.

I am sick of it and wonder if there is a way to restart the driver for the card reader/reset USB ports or similar I can do without restarting the computer every time?\n\nA: I have made some progress and a partial answer to my question is that it is not the driver that fails but Apple's smart card daemon. Restarting it\nsudo killall pcscd\nsudo /usr/sbin/pcscd -fda\n\nhas so far solved my problem everytime.\n", "Q: Command + R not working on Snow Leopard reboot I am trying to install OSX (10.6) from disk, but before I do I want to format the hard drive which requires the Disk Utility from the disk.\nI am pressing Command + R at start up, but the MacBook is still booting up normally. I've tried before the chime, after the chime, during the chime. Nothing.\nI am using the 13\" MacBook Pro Mac OS X Install DVD that came with the laptop.\nAny ideas what's going on?\n\nA: Command+R is used to enter Recovery Partition which comes with Lion and Mountain Lion.\nTo start up from the installation DVD (or any bootable CD or USB, for that matter) you must reboot holding down C before the chime and hold until the Apple logo appears.\nYou could, too, just let it boot normally, and then run the installer (once the DVD is mounted in Finder), which will, then, start up into the DVD.\n", "Q: Transfer RAM from MacBook Mid 2010 to MacBook Pro 2008 I ruined my beloved mid 2010 MacBook and planning to get a used MacBook Pro 2008 (not unibody) now. Currently, I have 2x4GB memory units in my MacBook and I would like to now if I can use at least one of them in the MacBook Pro. I heard that the 2008 Pro only supports up to 6 Gb, so I would like to use 1x4GB from my MacBook, and 1xGB from the Pro.\nI am not fully sure if I want a 2008 Pro yet. These are some points that would influence my decision\n\nA: There were several MacBook Pro models released in 2008. Only the Unibody models support DDR3 RAM, so keep an eye out for those.

Either Chrome provides its own implementation which could in fact display two windows over two displays, or - let's cross fingers - Apple implements this somewhere around 10.9 :)\n\nA: I have (finally!) gotten this to work reliably in Chrome Version 28.0.1500.95 and OSX 10.8.4. Previously, I would only sometimes be able to get things to work in the way Matthew Helfgott described. Other times, the dev tools would just jump to its own full screen space. Here's how I got it to work every time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try Matthew Helfgott's suggestion. If it works, throw a party.\n\n*If your devtools move to their own full-screen space, take them out of full screen mode. It should drop it on one of your non-full-screen spaces.\n\n*Once you have the dev tools in a normal (non-full-screen) space, move it to the monitor you want it to stick to (not the monitor chrome will be on).\n\n*Click the \"Dock to main window\" button in the lower left to bring it back to chrome.\n\n*Click that button again to undock it. It should now move to the monitor you previously chose, but stay in chrome's full-screen space.\n\n\nIf these instructions aren't clear enough, let me know and I can add screenshots.\n\nA: So, I tend to use Chrome for JavaScript app development, but since around version 15/17 (or there about), its not been possible to open the debugger console in a separate window in a two monitor development environment. Thing is, if you open Safari 6.0.4 (and maybe earlier) and you show the developer console, there is an option to 'detach into separate window' by clicking the multi-monitor icon beside the close button to the left of the console. The fault here seems to be Google IMHO. Don't know what happened and have filed a bug about it but will add if I do. Hope that helps a little.... otherwise, if you're committed to Chrome and not concentrating on user experience, you can dock the console to the right hand side of the page you are looking at. That way you get a potentially buggy DOM, but at least you can inspect your code on a running page. Ok. In fact that sucks, but it might help until Google get it sorted out.\n\nA: I am able to have the browser on one screen and the dev tools in another, both filling the screens, in the following steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Chrome browser window on one screen\n\n*Open dev tools\n\n*Click the window icon in the bottom left corner to detach the dev tools\n\n*Drag dev tools to second screen\n\n*Use the green + button in the top left or drag the corner of the window to resize to fill the screen\n\n\nThis doesn't use the Lion full screen but as others have said and is a common complaint this mode is unfortunately only compatible with one screen. I really hope Apple changes their tune about this soon and I hope this workaround is what you were looking for.\n\nA: One solution to your problem is to update to Mavericks, which has this solved but not by default.\nWhats happening is that when you go full screen, Mission Control (\"four fingers up\" on touchpad by default I think) is creating a new instance inside of Mission Control for that full screen separate from your actual monitors. You can see this by viewing the mission control while in full screen and while not in full screen.\nYou want to disable this. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"Launchpad\" >> \"System Preferences\" >> \"Mission Control\"\n\n*Deselect \"Displays have spaces\"\n\n*You may need to log out & log back in to see the changes\n\n\nSimilar question at: https://superuser.com/questions/665004/how-do-you-prevent-the-dock-from-switching-monitors-in-osx-mavericks\n\nA: Another solution that i used is to do the following - \n\n\n*\n\n*Undock developer tools to another window  \n\n*Open mission control\n\n*Drag the developer tools app from desktop 1 to desktop 2  \n\n*Open\nchrome on desktop 1 and developer tools associated to chrome window\non desktop 2\n\n\nA: I've been using a third-party app called Spectacle to work around the poor window manager in OSX and get \"fullscreen\" windows on both monitors when debugging in Chrome.\nThe default key chord to maximize a window (filling the screen but leaving the task bar in view), ⌥⌘F, let's me drag the devtools to my secondary screen and have both the main window and the console maximized on separate displays.\nIt's not a true fullscreen, but it's close enough.\n\nA: You can open chrome dev tools in its own tab by visiting chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html.\nThis is often used when you are proxying traffic to the dev tools from a remote device. This is how the ios-webkit-debug-proxy works.\n", "Q: How do I sync all my apple devices? I have a MacBook Pro, an iPhone (4S) and just recently received my iPad mini through the post. I am wondering how I can sync all of my devices so that every contact, app and music are on all three devices.\nSo, when I delete a contact from one device it automatically deletes from the others. I have also just set up my iCloud account and wonder if that can handle syncing these three data classes.  \n\nA:  iCloud\n— What it does do —\n\n\n*\n\n*synchronize (only over iTunes bought!) music if specified\n\n*synchronize pictures (photo stream)\n\n*keeping track of your device-location\n\n*backups of your device\n\n\n— What it doesn't do —\n\n\n*\n\n*synchronizing application data UNLESS specifically implemented by the app\n\n*keeping applications in-sync — this is due to different device classes have different preferred applications. For instance, you usually use different apps on an iPad as you would on an iPhone\n\nA: There isn't one solution for the three sorts of information you seek to sync.\niCloud is designed to wirelessly sync the following classes of information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail\n\n*Contacts\n\n*Calendars\n\n*Reminders\n\n*Safari Bookmarks\n\n*Notes\n\n*Passbook data\n\n*Photostream\n\n*Documents & Data (only the things stored in iCloud)\n\n\nMusic isn't something that is synced remotely. It is synced each and every time the iOS device is on the same Wi-Fi as the computer and you could purchase iTunes Match to have all your music purchases stored in the cloud. This also syncs ratings, artwork, playlists and play counts - but it's an additional yearly subscription. Most people I know are fine syncing Music locally, but you have that option with Apple today in some countries.\n", "Q: Chrome can't load certain sites but Safari can - how can I diagnose the problem? Please note: this question is from 2013, but it's received some recent answers (2017). I personally haven't experienced this problem for several years. It's possible that others still have the same issue and that answers to this question might help them -- but it seems more likely that my problem was fixed long ago and that more recent issues are actually a different problem.\n\nWhen accessing the internet from my home connection, Google Chrome has trouble accessing certain sites that use https. These include Google search, Facebook and discussions.apple.com, but for some reason Gmail is ok. This is on a Retina Macbook Pro with 10.8.3 Mountain Lion.\nGiven the symptoms described below, it the issue seems likely to be some misconfiguration of the router, which unfortunately I'm not in a position to change. However, since it works in Safari but not Chrome, the two browsers must be doing something differently. What I would really like to know is how I can diagnose what this difference is. \nWhat happens when I try to access the site varies depending on the site. Google search works intermittently, and when it doesn't work it times out as if the server was down. Facebook.com consistently renders the first two wall posts but then stops loading. The Apple forums just sit there forever with a white screen.\nI can access these sites just fine in Safari, and they also work fine when I'm browsing via the WiFi at work. It's only when I'm (a) using the ethernet cable at home, and (b) using Google Chrome that the problem occurs. Unfortunately I have no access to the router at home, because the internet is part of my rental agreement and I just have an ethernet socket in my room.\nI have tried the following things (and possibly more) to no avail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clearing all brower data in Chrome (cache, cookies etc.)\n\n*Disabling all extensions and restarting Chrome\n\n*Switching to Google public DNS\n\n*Checking my proxy settings in OS X. (No proxies are configured. Both Safari and Chrome use the system settings.)\n\n*Checking that my IP address is the same when browsing via https from Chrome and Safari (it is.)\n\n*Looking for any suspicious messages in Console. (There are several about things relating to Spotlight, but nothing relating to Chrome, and nothing comes up when I try to load these sites.)\n\n*Disabling \"Predict network actions to improve page load performance\" in Chrome preferences. This changes the symptoms slightly (Facebook times out instead of displaying the first two wall posts; other sites behave the same as before) but does not resolve the issue.\n\n*Rebooting into safe mode\n\n*Deleting my Chrome profile\n\n*Deleting all the other files in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome\n\n*Setting ipv6 to \"Link-local only\" in system preferences\n\n*Turning off ipv6 completely by running networksetup -setv6off Ethernet in Terminal\n\n*Accessing the web via TOR. The problem does not occur, but the connection is too slow for regular use.\n\n\nMy question is, what else can I do to try and work out what the problem is? Chrome is obviously doing something different from what Safari does when trying to access these sites, and I'd like to know what that is, with a view to either solving the problem for myself, or at least being able to submit a bug report to whichever party is responsible.\n\nA: You did eventing right except for one step.\nMaking new account.\nQuit Google Chrome completely.\nGo to the Go menu > Go to Folder.\nEnter the following directories in the text field, then press Go.\n    ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/\nLocate the folder called \"Default\" in the directory window that opens and rename it as \"Backup default.\"\nTry opening Google Chrome again. A new \"Default\" folder is automatically created as you start using the browser.\nAlternatively you can \"teach\" your browser.\nThat is done by adding the :80 to the web address.\nExample www.myseite.com:80\nAlso run the netstat -a -p tcp  to see if https (443) are open)\nLast not least, turn off the experimental \"Built-in Asynchronous DNS\" is Disabled in chrome://flags/\n\nA: Hi I was having the same issue on MacOS Sierra and the issue was resolved by opening a new incognito window and then it works.\nAfter which I resume to the normal chrome mode and all websites load successfully.\nHope this helps anyone.\nTC\n\nA: Have you tried using the incognito mode? Shift+Command+T+N and trying the websites again from that page?\n\nA: This appears to be a bug with Chrome and XP.  There appears to be no resolution. \n\nA: If you have downloaded the Google Chrome Ad Block extension, try customizing it by clicking on “Show ads on a webpage or domain”, then typing the problematic webpage address into the “The domain or url where AdBlock shouldn’t block anything field”, then hitting the “OK!” button.\n\nA: The Incognito mode worked for me. But it didn't hold up back in normal mode.\nHad to go to Settings / Advanced settings / Privacy and click the Content settings… button, then go to Cookies and click the All cookies and site data… button; then search for problemsite.com and hit the Remove all button.\nThis worked for me (on Windows 10).\n\nA: I have been using VPN service in China.And I got same problem here and found out I just had to disable one extension called \"unlock youku\" which prevented all the ads in a local video webisite in Chrome. Then the chrome is compatible with VPN service.\n\nA: I tried all of the steps above and none of them worked. The solution for me was rebooting the Modem/Router. \nIt made no sense to me because I was able to access the site on Safari but not on Chrome. Simple Modem/Router Reset did the trick.\n", "Q: Enable Parental Controls but allow Google Drive and game playing I am administering the laptops of 2 of a friends's boys (13 and 15, so ...). I have put Parental Controls in place but this is playing havoc with Google Drive and Steam, possibly also Minecraft but not sure yet.\nI have no answer for Google Drive at present, it can browse folders OK but on opening a doc the contents can be seen briefly then Safari crashes. Odd bits of voodoo I found to add exceptions to the web filtering do not seem to make any difference. Steam seems to have an unpublished set of IP addresses it contacts and whitelisting here seems like a hopeless task. So rather than trying to fight it I was going to circumvent the whole thing.\nMy proposal is to create a gamer account on each boy's machine. This has parental control enabled but is set up to allow access to all websites but restricts the user to run Steam, Minecraft (and any other parentally approved games) only. One advantage is that time limits can be set on the gamer account while leaving the main account free for homework.\nDoes this seem viable? Any answers for Google Drive?\n\nA: Not a complete answer but might help someone else looking for a solution for Steam. \nI had no end of trouble if Steam was installed in /Applications, even if there was no restrictions on which applications could be run. \nHowever, if Steam was installed in the user's Desktop (or somwhere else in their home directory) then after initial approvals on first run it ran without subsequent parental invovement. I had no restrictions on executing applications, I suspect it may have different had there been any restrictions in place.\n", "Q: How to turn off the dictation beep? For dictation on OS X, you have double-tap a key (I've set mine to fn) to start dictating. It then does a very irritating beep noise. And when you hit return, it does another very irritating beep noise.\nHow do I turn off this very irritating beep noise, without turning down the system volume?\n\nA: Tested:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are 3 sound files for the 3 functions: start, cancel, and stop.\n\n*They are called: dt-begin.caf, dt-cancel.caf, and dt-confirm.caf (respectively). These have a mid, low, and high tone (respectively).\n\n*They are located in: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AssistantServices.framework/Versions/A/Resources/\n\n*You can make a functional .caf audio file by simply changing the extension of a .aif/.aiff file to .caf.\n\n*You can convert from another format or create a .aif/.aiff in iTunes, Garageband, most audio editing programs, etc.\n\n*If you put a store-bought music CD in your computer you will often see the tracks as .aiff, not .aif files. However, they are the same format. An analogy is .jpg and .jpeg. The only difference I know of being you can set different programs to open each by default.\n\n\nPower users should mostly be able to take it from here, and/or skip to Step 10.\nFor the rest:\nNotes for novice audio conversion folks:\nAIFF stands for Audio Interchange File Format.\nIf you put a CD in your computer the files will have .aiff\nIf you convert files with iTunes you will end up with .aif (missing second 'f')\nIf you convert files with other programs you may be able to choose, or set ahead of time, or will simply get what the devs decided you get.\nTo convert a bit of (optionally silent) audio in iTunes 11 to an aiff file:\nTurn off Dictation: (System Preferences>System(tab)>Dictation&Speech(button))\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes(menu)>Preferences(menu-item)>General(tab)>Import Settings...(button)>Import Using(menu)> \nchange to: AIFF Encoder\nclick OK (button).\n\n*Find a song with a silent intro (fastest), or segment, or any sound that you like.\n\n*Get Info on the song (command-i, or right-click, or control-click, or File(menu)>Get Info). Go to the Options tab.\n\n*Edit the Start and Stop times to bracket the portion you want for the new sound (this may be 10 milliseconds of silence, up to you). The check-box(es) will automatically tick themselves if you edit the time(s). Click OK. (Do not worry, this is non-destructive and the times will be reset back to the correct ones down to the thousandth of a second if you uncheck the boxes and click OK again, I will remind you at the end to do this.)\n\n\n*\n\n***If you want NO sound, DO NOT simply remove the relevant files from the framework. Follow the directions herein and make a \"silent\" piece of audio from a quiet part of a song.\n\n*You can use any combination of the default sounds and your own.\n\n*You can use other built-in system sounds, like alerts, etc. Just go to /System/Library/Sounds and copy your favorite alert sound(s) and rename as appropriate (see the following steps).\n\n\n*control-click, or right-click, or File(menu)>Create New Version> and select Create AIFF Version. Then from either menu from the first sentence of this step select Show In Finder, or hit command-shift-r.\n\n*Go to Finder and open a new Finder window (command-shift-n) so you have two windows open. In the new window, navigate to the directory with the default dictation sounds (for the novice do this: by highlighting, then copying (command-c) the following line (it works, it's different from the actual directory path, given at the top of the answer, if you want you can use that one instead, the Resources in the following string is merely an in-built alias or sym-link):\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AssistantServices.framework/Resources\nhit command-shift-g, then command-v to paste in what you just copied, then hit return)\n\n*Back-up the original files (they are called:\ndt-begin.caf, dt-cancel.caf, and dt-confirm.caf) by dragging them to a folder you create somewhere specifically for the purpose of backing up in case something goes wrong or you don't like your new custom sound files. Sometimes I like to name the folder the the path to the directory where the system files came from with modifications like this. Since you can now include the / character in filenames this is not a problem (typically). If you want the best of both worlds simply make an empty directory in your backup directory with the path-as-name next to the files you just backed up, so if there's a problem with some third-party backup program it will fail copying an empty directory, no great harm. Directory and folder are interchangeable terms herein. Once they're backed up, delete them from the Resources folder. You will have to authenticate as an admin since they are protected system files. \n\n*Now, in the other window showing the new music file you created (in your iTunes library somewhere) rename the file to whatever sound file you are replacing. If replacing all three default sounds with the same file, duplicate it by highlighting it and hitting command-d twice, or three times if you want to keep the ORIGINAL filename/file in your iTunes library for any reason. Then rename them appropriately, as per step 7. Confirm you want to change the extension. Then hold down option to copy them to the Resources folder. You will have to authenticate again.\n\n*Cleanup time (before we forget. This is the second to last step):\n\n\n*\n\n*backup the 3 (or 4) files you just made/renamed to a folder as well. This way you should always be deleting or REPLACING the files in the Resources folder by copying and you'll always have a backup of your custom set and the original set.\n\n*delete the renamed custom files from the iTunes library folder they were in if you didn't move them in the sub-step before this one where you backed them up.\n\n*if you don't want the original modified song file in iTunes you can move it too, or you can leave it in there for reference. If you moved it in the previous sentence or at the beginning of cleanup, then highlight it in iTunes and hit the 'Delete' key, then confirm, I would move to trash if it's there still and you don't want it.\n\n*go back into iTunes and Get Info on your original song file, and go back to Options to change the Start/Stop times back to original by unchecking the boxes and hitting 'OK' (iTunes will automatically get the correct Stop time, don't worry!), like in step 4.\n\n\n*Now that you've changed the files with Dictation off you can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*a) Reboot (if Dictation was turned on since the last time you booted up, or if you don't know, or just to be as sure as possible you're having a good shot)\n\n*b) kill the 'assistantd' process owned by 'you'. (If you don't know what this means, just reboot, there's been enough hand-holding so far.)\n\n*Once your computer comes back on, log-in and go to System Preferences to Re-Enable Dictation.\n\n\n\nPower User / Activity Monitor Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*DO NOT simply remove the relevant files from the framework if you want a 'silent' notification (replace them with silent sound files). This will cause a crash of the relevant processes, and spawn the ReportCrash process, and dictation will fail to recognize any audio input, and assistantd will have 'unexpected' behavior.\n\n*Three (3) Principle processes are launched when Dictation is turned on (all run by the user):\n\n\n*\n\n*assistand is launched first, and doesn't quit on its own.\n\n*Dictation is then launched a few seconds later, and auto-quits ~6 seconds after Dictation is turned off normally (in System Preferences).\n\n*ABAssistantService is launched a few seconds after Dictation and I believe it is gathering and then passing to assistantd to upload some amount of AddressBook data, then quits. This happens if it's been ~>45 seconds since the last launch.

Is there a way I can delete all my encrypted iPhone backups for which I forgot the password, so that I can start backing up from fresh? \nAt the moment I'm stuck in this loop (below) which I can't seem to exit\n \n\nA: To delete the backups, go to iTunes>Preferences>Devices. All iPhone backups will be listed here. Highlight them, then hit Delete. \nBut if you're using a Mac, I would first try to see if you can find the password in your Keychain (from discussions.apple.com):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to the \"keychain access \" app.\n  \n*Under \"Keychains\" select \"Login\"\n  \n*Under \"Category\" select \"Passwords\"\n  \n*Scroll down and look for \"iPhone Backup\"\n  \n*Double click and a window opens\n  \n*Check the box that says \"Show Password\"\n  \n*A window pops up asking for your OS X account password\n  \n*Type in that password and voila!\n  \n\n\nA: The password is stored on the device!\nIf you can’t remember the password for your encrypted backup\nYou can’t restore an encrypted backup without its password.

You can do that either via iTunes on your Mac or if the password window is preventing you from doing so do it from your iPhone by navigating to Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup > iCloud Backup ON. \nThe next time you connect your iPhone to iTunes, the iTunes backups should be gone along with the message asking for your password. \nOnce you effectuate a full iOS backup to the iCloud, you can revert back to making backups with iTunes instead.\n", "Q: Can you sync only a group of contacts from a Mac to an iPhone? I'm running iOS 6 on an iPhone 3GS. I see that all my contacts from my computer have appeared in the Contacts app on my phone. Now my contacts database on my computer is, to say the least, messy. It includes just about everyone I exchanged e-mail with over the past twenty years.

How to auto-run disk repair on OS X 10.8+ after each system crash?\nNote: I am not looking for a manual solution.\n\nA: I don't know if OS X already performs some extra checks after hard shutdowns or kernel panics. The verbose startup output looked the same after a normal restart, a hard restart, and a kernel panic:\n\nThe OS X volume is verified when starting up in safe mode:\n\nDo you mean repairing the drive, repairing the main OS X volume, or running fsck? http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1417 recommends first starting up in safe mode (which includes repairing the OS X volume), or if that doesn't work, repairing the drive or OS X volume from Disk Utility on the recovery partition.

How do I get the accounts squared away so they are no playing each others game?  For example, everyone has \"Clash of the clans\" on their iPads and they all play the same game.  How can we get it so each person can create their own world in the game and not interfere with each others' game?\n\nA: If you ensure that each device has a distinct iCloud account so that the Documents and Data for each device is stored in a separate account, you can have the 4 devices all share one Apple ID for purchasing and have a separate account for each child's mail, contacts, messages, etc...\n\nA: As I understand it, iOS games keep their save states associated with a particular Apple ID and its associated Game Center username. You could definitely have different save states on different iPads for different children if they had different Apple IDs - however, be warned that this will mean that you'll have to buy the game independently for each Apple ID if it's not free.\nSome games, however, will allow you to have multiple save states under the same ID. I'm not sure if this is the case with Clash of the Clans - I'm not familiar with it.\nAs patrix noted below, it may be possible to download the same game to multiple devices with multiple accounts - I'm still unsure if this will interfere with online behaviour/Game Center interaction, however.\n", "Q: Music Sharing - Different iTunes Accounts I have a relative who will be visiting from out of state, and I would like to share my music.

What options do I have to do this?\nthanks...\n\nA: You can share your music with your relative by either burning it on a CD for him, or copying the music from iTunes to an external drive.  All he has to do when he gets home is copy it to his computer and set it up so that Apple TV can stream from it.  I would not recommend syncing the music to his iPad, he will not be able to remove it from his iPad. \nMusic that ripped from your CD's should copy over just fine.  However, some iTunes music is linked to your Apple ID, so when he copies it to his computer, his computer must be authorized to use your apple id content.  You can authorize your iTunes account on his computer by going to store authorize this computer to use an Apple ID.\n", "Q: Wi-fi login Network Accounts are Unavailable I work support and mainly work with PCs so my mac experience is limited. Right now one of the mac laptops we support is not utilizing the wifi at the user login screen and displaying \"Network accounts are unavailable.\" I can login with the local admin and the wifi automatically connects as it should then, but I can't seem to jiggle anything loose to restore the wifi connection at login screen. I would appreciate any help or advice on how to restore this functionality as all of the laptop users need to be connected to the wifi for their domain accounts to be granted access on the laptop. \n\nA: I presume you mean this error message:\n\nI have had this problem in the past, due to an incorrectly configured DNS on the local machine.

Is there a native rpmbuild utility that will run on MacOSX?  So far I have found some old abandoned macports/darwin projects and people recommending running virtual box/parallels in virtual VM mode.  Is there really no native tool for building rpms on Mac?\n\nA: Building RPMs or more specifically the binaries/libraries within them on a Mac is not a safe bet because you can run into a number of issues involving architecture mismatches, among other issues like library linking.\nIn short, if you're building for Linux, you really want to build on Linux. It's possible to cross-compile, but IMHO this is incredibly difficult on OS X. \n\nA: I've tried homebrew to install somewhat recent versions of the tool. The package for rpm installs fine but rpmbuild does not work.\n\nA: You don't need to seperately install rpmbuild. After installation of rpm, the command rpmbuild also works.\n", "Q: How do apps installed via Mobile Device Management behave? What happens if a user installed an app manually (from AppStore or Enterprise App) and later on MDM tries to install the same app?\n\n\n*\n\n*Does MDM app installation fails (because the app is installed already)\n\n*Does MDM overwrite existing app?\n\n*Does MDM request whether to overwrite?\n\n\nMDM has a notion of \"managed apps\". These apps are installed through MDM and MDM can remove them. Mainly, I am interested in this question to understand whether these apps could be removed through MDM later on.\nIf MDM overwrites existing app (with or without user acceptance) then these apps will be managed and could be removed through MDM later on. If MDM fails to install them than they won't be managed (can't be uninstalled).\n\nA: Having an MDM doesn't change the permissions and app deletion behavior on iOS so it only facilitates getting a redemption code onto the device.\nWhat really matters is who signed the app. If the app is signed from Apple - then it doesn't matter if it came from iTunes, iCloud restore, MDM or Apple's app store. A user can either delete all apps or no apps based on the iOS profile in force.\nNow, for enterprise signed apps (or developer signed apps), you can tie a signing certificate or trust chain to a configuration profile and ensure that apps signed by that cert get deleted when the profile is deleted.\nSo a user can decide to remove one app or remove all apps or remove the profile. But the user can't remove the profile and have the apps remain.\nThis is a nice general overview. If you select a particular MDM solution (Casper, AirWatch, Mobile Iron, etc..) or just use iPhone Configuration utility or Apple Configurator - you can re-ask this to nail down your particular deployment scenario and we can dive deeper into what you seek to accomplish.\n", "Q: Can OS X access files in my Dropbox account without using space on my local hard drive? Question in title. Is there any way for such configuration?\nOR at least that files are stored only on one computer.\nOf course I am aware that I can use internet browser version of dropbox, but I would like to use the desktop one, but exactly in the way a browser version works, i.e. without losing hard drive space.\n\nA: \nUpdate: See nassimhddd's answer below about ExpanDrive allowing you to mount your DropBox account as (external) drive - since\n  its Mac version 3.0.3021 May 2013.\n\nThe short answer to this is: No. As far as I'm aware, you can't mount your Dropbox account as some sort of remote file share - its synced files are always written to your local disk.\nThat said, you can change the location of the Dropbox folder away from its default of ~/Dropbox, so if you have a separate internal or external disk you could put the Dropbox folder there. \nYou may encounter problems if Dropbox occasionally can't access the detached volume holding its folder, however. See here:\n\nYour Dropbox folder must be available when your computer boots and\n  before the Dropbox desktop application starts. Some USB drives, for\n  example, take some time to mount before your computer recognizes them.\n  The Dropbox desktop application could start before such a drive is\n  ready and get confused. You will receive an error and Dropbox will\n  give you the opportunity to relink your Dropbox account or exit if it\n  is unable to find your Dropbox folder.\n\n\nA: ExpanDrive\nSince its Mac version 3.0.3021, ExpanDrive makes this possible. I just tested it and am very satisfied: very easy to setup and the folder navigation is very reactive (which was not the case with DropDAV). Plus it works with many other services (google drive, box, etc.).\n\nA: You can use a third party service like Otixo or DropDAV that will allow you to connect through webdav protocol.\nUnfortunately I don't know anything free.\nAnyway after you have create your account you have just to press cmd+k in the finder and connect to the server using the new credentials. This will mount a virtual drive with Dropbox content. You can also mount the drive at startup adding it into login items list.\n\nA: rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of Rclone’s cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.\nrclone mount \n\nA: Transmit can access your Dropbox files without needing the Dropbox app.\n\nA: For basic free Dropbox no but see other answers for workarounds\nFor paid versions of Dropbox there is something called Smart Sync https://www.dropbox.com/smart-sync which allows you to choose if certain files are downloaded to a device or not.\n\nNormally, synced files are downloaded fully to your computer and they take up hard drive space. With Smart Sync, you can make files and folders \"online only\". Online-only files only use a small amount of hard drive space to store information such as the file name, size and thumbnail, but the full contents of the files are stored securely in the Dropbox cloud. You’ll always see your online-only files on your computer, so when you need them, you can open them with just a click.\n\n\nA: This is a little bit old question, but yes, this can be done very easily.\nExpanDrive is an app that does that. It works not only for Dropbox but also for Google Drive, S3, SFTP WebDAV and many other cloud storage solutions.\n\nA: Here is the solution. Dropbox is great! Selective syncing. \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/guide/business/manage-files/save-your-hard-drive-space\n", "Q: Requirement when submitting app to Apple When I try to set up the app in Apple iTunes Connect to submit my app, I was asked to provide the support url. \nCan I use my blog website for this?\n\nA: I have seen many apps do this and there is no documented requirement as to what the support URL contains.\nTable 10-2 of the iTunes Connect Developer Guide (Editing and Updating App Information) contains the reference to need to provide a support URL and there isn't any mention of requirements. \nClearly, the reviewer may visit your site during the review process and perhaps have a software monitor it periodically. \nI've not known them to send a request for support during the review process, but I'd hate to fail review due to this item.\nMy advice is to be absolutely clear and indicate where on your blog the support avenue lies. I'd also set up third party monitoring of that URL in case it goes down during review and once your app is live on the app store.\n", "Q: How do I install one extension for all Firefox profiles?

I've tried copying the installed extension into various folders in /Library and ~/Library but nothing has worked.\nHow do I install a Firefox extension once so it is active for all profiles on the computer (or this user account, either is good)?\n\nA: You need to put the global extensions (.xpi files) into the /Applications/Firefox.app/MacOS/extensions folder (when you select Firefox.app, right-click and \"Show package contents\").\nIf Firefox doesn't recognize the xpi, try to install it for your profile, then move it from ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<profile>.default/extensions to the path mentioned above.\n", "Q: How can I search bookmarks and history stored on mobile safari within iOS? Within desktop Safari, one can view and edit bookmarks within a a hiearchical list.\nFor Mobile-Safari running on an iPad: How do you view all bookmarks? How do you search within Bookmarks?\n\nA: There is no interface for searching within Mobile Safari.\nThere is no secondary viewing options other than tapping and pawing through the history UI that mobile safari draws when you tap the book icon to the right of the navigation arrows at the top of the screen.\nIn the absence of a native solution, you can get at the history and bookmarks once you connect an iOS device to a computer.\nOn Mac OS, you can use a tool like PhoneView to archive all data from an iOS device, and this archive includes mobile Safari's web history and bookmarks so you can make fast work of searching the 8 days of device history once you have the data on your Mac.\n\nA: Since iOS 6 or so, if you type in the safari searchbar it also looks up your bookmarks and sites in the history.

Now, I want to back up all my settings.\nI found my collections in ~/Library/Font Collections\nBut where does OS X store which fonts are disabled? I want to copy this \"list\" and move it to my new mac.\n\nA: I don't have Fonts Disabled folders either, but the list of disabled fonts is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FontRegistry.user.plist. If you copy it to another computer, run sudo atsutil databases -remove; atsutil server -shutdown to apply the changes.\n\nA: Where the list of disabled fonts is stored depends on the version of OS X you are using.\nFirst of all, the ~/Library/Fonts Disabled/ and /Library/Fonts Disabled have never been used by Apple for the handling of disabled fonts; rather, fonts are simply deactivated in place: there's no need to move them out of the /Fonts/ folder in order to deactivate them. Those folders are most likely created by the Microsoft Office installer for Mac, or some other application installer.\nAs I mentioned, where the list of deactivated fonts is stored depends on the version of OS X you're using.\nOS X 10.3: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ATS.plist stores a list of file paths to the fonts which have been disabled in Font Book.\nOS X 10.4 — 10.6: The enabled or disabled state of a particular font is stored within the font cache files themselves. There is no saved external record (like the preference file used in 10.3) of which fonts were disabled.\nIn OS X 10.7.x and later, while the enabled or disabled state of a particular font is still stored within the font cache files themselves, an external record of which fonts were disabled is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FontRegistry.user.plist.\n", "Q: Why don't my Time Machine backups get corrupted?

And every time this happens, the front-most application, the one I am using at that moment, hangs until the disk has spun up.\nWhy does that happen and can I tell OS X that the application in focus ought to have priority over hard disks?

My son has a inappropriate picture of a girl as her contact photo... When I questioned him about it he said that she had made it her outgoing contact photo and he had no control over it... Is this possible or am I being lied to?!\n\nA: Yes, it's possible. If you go to the iOS settings app and sign in with either Facebook or Twitter, there is a button to retrieve contact pictures from those services for each contact on your device. \nSo, your child has the option to change that photo on a case by case basis, but what they said could be entirely true. \nAt is point, it gets less clear with syncing your address book with Facebook (or other). Presumably it could use each person's Facebook picture, set by them, as their photo in your address book. \nI've never seen a picture I assign get overwritten, but it's clearly possible that might happen. \n\nA: as Mike Scott says, you can sync and take pics online and set is to your contacts information, however, there is no sutch thing as a \"outgoing contact photo\"\nthis means if i have a picture of a pony as MY profile picture, you wont se a pony when i call! unless i have that picture online, like on Facebook, and you synced and downloaded that picture and made it my contact information photo!\nhowever, this should be added, there could be third party apps, where you decide what pictures others see when they call! like whatsapp (only texting), but if it was the native phone app on iOS (was the slide to answer visible?) its not possible! \nso he can change the pic, if its not a third party \"phone\" app\n", "Q: Macbook Pro not Starting I have a MacBook Pro and from the last week I have been unable to turn the machine on properly.

Restart your Mac and hold down ⌘ Command +R until the Apple logo appears on screen. If you see the following screen then there's a fair change the problem lies within the software of your Mac. You will probably need to reinstall your OS. \n\nThis article has more steps you can go down to help isolate the issue\nIf you still get the same error when trying to boot into the alternate Recovery OS, that would indicate a problem with the hardware of your Mac.

This trick ended it.\n\n\nA: Trackpad zooming is an OS X wide functionality. You can enable/disable Trackpad zooming in System Preferences -> Trackpad\n\n\nA: defaults write com.google.Chrome.plist PinchToChangeFontSizeDisabled -bool true\n\nOR\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome PinchToChangeFontSizeDisabled -bool true\n\nI don't have Chrome, so I cannot test the syntax.\n", "Q: How to edit theme colors in TextMate 2? In TextMate 1 there is a Fonts & Colors tab in Preferences to edit theme colors, but in TextMate 2 I cannot find how to do the same... \nI can select a theme in the View menu, but I want to customize a theme, the same way it was possible in TextMate 1, by selecting the \"scope\" and changing the color with a palette and the font style.\nWhere is this function in TextMate 2?\n\nA: Theme tweaking of the type you could do in TextMate 1 is not yet featured in TextMate 2 itself. HOWEVER... I just came across this very cool online TextMate theme editor. Its interface imitates the Fonts & Colors tab in the TM1 preferences.

I'm one of those greatly suffering from the problem with TM in which the entire backup sparsebundle on a NAS gets corrupted if the Mac goes to sleep in middle of a backup operation. There's a long process for recovering the backup, but it would be far better to avoid the corruption in the first place.\nIs there any way to hack the sleep function so that the Mac refuses to go to sleep if a TM backup is currently in progress? Or, if that's not possible, is there at least some way to show a confirmation dialog when manually choosing \"sleep\" from the apple menu, to prompt for a manual verification that no TM is currently running?\nClarification:\nOne of the situations I need to protect against, is my habit of manually choosing \"sleep\" from the apple menu. Hence, something like Caffeine which only prevents automatic sleep, isn't a solution for me.\n\nA: I have solved this with a bash script. It involves caffeinate built-in command and NoSleepCtrl (prevents sleep on lid close).\nIn my setup, I have TimeMachine disabled and run it using this command. It should not be difficult to create a wrapper, which would execute it periodically and either ask user for confirmation or wake the computer up and do it automatically.\nMy experience and steps for TM backup corruption on QNAP.\n\nA: One solution to perform backups that may take longer than the default sleep time, that does not require preventing your Mac from sleeping, is using Power Nap which allows your backup to be performed during sleep while connected to an AC Power Outlet (assuming you are using Time Machine to backup).\nNote that backups can only be performed in this method if your Mac is connected to power. However, this solution will work even during the OP's problem of manually forcing their Mac to sleep.\nPower Nap can be easily enabled by going to System Preferences → Energy Saver and clicking the check box next to Enable Power Nap.\n\nFor more information refer to the Apple Support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*How Power Nap works on your Mac\n\nA: This will keep Mac awake for two days: \nturn it into a script and make sure to chmod +x stayup.sh or whatever the name of the script is.\n#! /bin/sh\nlet TIME=$(expr 24*60*60*2); # 2 days in seconds\necho caffine for $TIME;\ncaffeinate -s -m -i -t $TIME;\n\nor just caffeinate -t 3600 &\n& - allows to run in the background, freeing up terminal.\n\nA: Try Mac app called \"Caffeine\"  it keeps your mac on for a time period or indefinitely. \n\nA: I had the same problem, so I turned off my sleep function, password, and also checked 'prevent computer going to sleep when the display is off'.  I am hoping this works.  I just discovered that a back up hadn't run in 76 days.\nThanks for the other help.\n\nA: Yeah, I was thinking of recommending the Caffeine app, especially if you are in the habit of kicking off Time Machine backups manually. \nAnother option might be to go into System Preferences > Energy Saver and setting your computer sleep timer to closer to 3 hours. Be advised, though, that this will increase the amount of energy your computer is consuming (since it will be awake longer for each session). You can keep your display timer down to a more reasonable duration to save power. Display sleep won't affect Time Machine. \n\nA: I just ran into this new addition -- the caffeinate command is built into OS X now, no app needed.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2014/06/16/caffeinate-prevent-sleep-while-command-active-mac-os-x/\n\nA: I suffered with Time Machine being interrupted by what I thought was the Mac going to sleep. I set the energy saver to \"Never got to sleep\" but would come back to the Mac and it was back to \"log in\" and the Time Machine action had been stopped. Eventually I realized in the Security settings that \"Log Out (after so many minutes) was checked. After unchecking this option I was able to stay logged in.\n\nA: This might be a bit simplistic but I went into System Preferences, opened Energy Saver and moved the slider to \"never sleep\". I will revert to the original when my backup has finished.\n", "Q: upgrading iphone 4 to iOS 5 I updated my iPhone 4 from iOS 4 to iOS 5 a while back.

With the 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard set to become the new wireless standard, I am wondering how quick Apple has been, historically speaking, to implement new standards like these in their AirPorts and Time Capsule.\nMore to the point, would these changes be likely to take effect before the end of the summer, historically speaking?\nTo be clear I am not asking about rumors or speculation, but rather would like historical evidence to back any claims made. \n\nA: The two wikipedia articles below have an easily searchable summary of both the Airport and 802.11 timelines in the past:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPort\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11\nLooking specifically at 802.11n - Apple shipped product in November 2006 supporting the draft in MacBook Pro cards. The AirPort hardware followed in January 2007 and the standard didn't get published until October 2009.\nApple clearly isn't allergic to getting way ahead of a standard, and often builds the flexibility to roll out new standards in shipping product and will never mention it (and sometimes the people disassembling the hardware when it's released are in the dark as to these undocumented abilities).\n\nHistorically, if a protocol were ready for robust service this summer, you would be safe to presume Apple has considered and built for that more than 18 months ago. \nThe real problem with these sort of \"crystal ball\" extrapolations is that Apple only backs things it knows will be a long term success. Take for example Blue Ray and HD DVD. Those standards are clearly far superior to DVD, yet Apple skipped those and has never spent time or money putting those faster, better, and more data dense formats into production. Clearly fast networking is more core to computing and a desirable competitive edge for marketing hardware than an optical media format choice, but you'll want to carefully examine how any \"advancement\" fits into the big picture for consumers and/or businesses.\nI personally don't see large percentages of the consumer population needing faster Wireless network access than 802.11n since fiber to the door and the rest of the network infrastructure in the US is lagging what current AirPort hardware can deliver. I would look instead for smarter devices that proxy app store downloads and undercut various cloud storage services with an Apple solution in the coming months rather than a spec bump.\nApple clearly has the money and expertise to skate to where the puck is going to be in terms of Wi-Fi improvements, but we as consumers often don't have the perspective Apple's engineers have of what's really in the queue for technology so our guessing is more of a parlor game than something I'd plan a purchase or investment around.\n\nA: We have seen Apple adopting 802.11 Draft-N before final specification was finalised, shipping AirPort cards on Macs and AirPort Extreme, Express and Time Capsule with it.\nEven before officially shipping those Mac there where Core 2 Duo Macs with AirPort Extreme cards that where compatible with 802.11 Draft-N specification and shipped without it enabled and later they charged 2 USD for those people who wanted to enable it.\nThose things that occurred in the past and the new code that appeared in 10.8.4 Beta related to 802.11ac may indicate that this new standard may not be to far away to be implemented.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable data detectors from Mail?

What's the proper syntax in Numbers for that? \nIf I try to import an Excel workbook using that syntax into Numbers, that formula will be imported verbatim and Numbers will complain. \n\nA: In numbers, SUMPRODUCT (range, range…) takes the following arguments:\n\nrange:   A range of cells. range is a reference to a single range of\ncells containing values of any type. If string or Boolean values are\nincluded in range, they are ignored.\nrange…:   Optionally include one\nor more additional ranges of cells.

Is there a way to have the display automatically change resolution to the default retina when on battery, and revert to 1680x1050 when power is reconnected? \n\nA: Your best bet would be to use ControlPlane (free) to detect when the power source has switched, and then fire off a shell script to change the resolution.\nThere's no built-in command line utility for changing the screen resolution, but someone came up with one that works well. You can download an installer here.\nThen it's just a simple matter of setting ControlPlane to run screenresolution set 1440x900 or 1650x1050 as appropriate.

There have been times where the screen just goes black or some blueish pattern, after which I'm forced to shut it down and restart.\nIt's less noticeable on Windows though, but still annoying since I primarily use macOS. I have tried resetting the SMC and PRAM and I recently reinstalled macOS.\nThis is not acceptable, repairing a two year old laptop by replacing the logic board will be expensive. I will call the Apple Support on Monday. Any advice?\n\nA: Since people are still commenting on this, I will post what happened as my answer:\nI took the MBP to a different store where they concluded that it was a faulty HDD cable since I had installed the SSD myself and they assumed it got some kind of shock for me not wearing an ESD bracelet. (Although as far as I can remember, the friend of mine who installed the SSD for me did indeed wear the bracelet, however I probably didn't use it when I installed RAM 1,5 years ago) \nIt seemed to work fine for a while but after that, the glitches started to reappear, and it became so bad that the MBP couldn't boot into OS X or Windows (stuck on grey screen with glitchy stripes).\nOnce again, I took it to the shop, they concluded that it was a faulty logic board, which would cost me a fortune to replace. However, thanks to EU consumer laws, I have the right of up to 3 years warranty if I could prove that it's the manufacturer's fault. So they let me fill in a form and send it in along with my receipt. By the beginning of July, Apple finally approved to replace the logic board for free.

My question is:\n\nHow can i determine which files are on the SSD \"partition\" on Fusion\n  Drive?\n\nI have an iMac with 1TB Fusion Drive, and it would be good to know which apps or data are on which partition. \n\nIs these information included in the file information or where do i\n  have to look?\n\nTerminal is no problem, so i'm not searching for a easy answer. \nEDIT: diskutil list shows me my partitions. But i cannot navigate through /Volumes/... into the specific SSD partition. There must be a way to navigate into each partition, right?\nOS X does the same.\n\nA: Because the Fusion drive is one logical volume, there are no separate \"partitions\" to browse to determine this. You can however check which drive an given file is stored on with some command-line utilities.\nDetermine Your Drive Setup\nFirst we have to figure out how the SSD and HD portions of the Fusion drive are identified in your system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run diskutil list in Terminal.\n\n*You should see output similar to this:\n#: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER\n0: GUID_partition_scheme *121.3 GB disk0\n1: EFI 209.7 MB disk0s1\n2: Apple_CoreStorage 121.0 GB disk0s2\n3: Apple_Boot Boot OS X 134.2 MB disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n#: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER\n0: GUID_partition_scheme *1.0 TB disk1\n1: EFI 209.7 MB disk1s1\n2: Apple_CoreStorage 999.3 GB disk1s2\n3: Apple_Boot Recovery HD 650.0 MB disk1s3\n/dev/disk2\n#: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER\n0: Apple_HFS Macintosh HD *1.1 TB disk2\n\n\n*Take note of labels of the disks with a GUID_partition_scheme line. In this case, that's disk0 and disk1. These are the two physical disks, and we can see by the sizes, the smaller one (disk0) is the SSD, meaning disk1 is the HD while disk2 is the logical volume.\nMonitor Disk Activity\nNow we need a way to monitor disk activity for each device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal, enter iostat -d disk0 disk1 1, replacing the disk numbers with those you found in above.\n\n*Run the command, and leave the Terminal window open. You should see output similar to this:\n       disk0           disk1 \n KB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s \n 26.52  13  0.33     9.35   0  0.00 \n 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00 \n 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00 \n 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00 \n\nThis shows you the disk activity on a per-device basis, updated every second.

VirtualBox and Parallels.\nIssue:\nWhich of them good enough for visualization tasks? (GPU, games)\nI want to install on my Macbook Pro 2011 more RAM: 4gb -> 8gb.\nAfter that I want to install on virtual machine Win7 or Win8 with 4-5gb RAM.\nAs GPU I have AMD Radeon HD 6770M 1024 МБ\nSo, which of (VirtualBox or Parallels) give me more visualization performance?\n\nA: It depends on what kind of thing you want to do, but neither will be a good enough option.\nIf doing GPU-intensive work, your best and probably only option is BootCamp, and then Parallels.\nVMWare Fusion would work, but it's slightly behind Parallels. VirtualBox is worst, but it's free.\nAs for whether you want Windows 7 or 8, it really depends, Windows 8 start up a lot faster, but consumes quite a lot more resource than Windows 7 until I turened off some useless services.\nHere's a link you can check out if you like to see some benchmark result.\nhttp://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/parallels-desktop-8-vs-vmware-fusion-5-benchmark-showdown\nAnd here's a even better one that compares all three virtualization software against Boot Camp.\nhttp://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/benchmarking-parallels-fusion-and-virtualbox-against-boot-camp\n\nA: In my experience the graphical performance of Parallels is better than VirtualBox. I tested it running different versions of Ubuntu and Windows 7.\nFor simple tasks VirtualBox is sufficient and it's free. But if you want to play games Parallels might be the better choice.\nAn alternative could be the cheaper VMware Fusion, but I never tested it.\nBut there are trial versions available of both Parallels and VWmare (VirtualBox is free anyway), so you could test what performs best in your use cases before you buy anything.\n", "Q: how do i get my iTunes off 'guest user' & on to another user on same computer?

In the file system that I dedicate to swap, siblings of \n/Volumes/swap/swapfile0\nare created very quickly. Simple use of an app seems to result in more swap files than comparable use of that app with a normal boot. \nPerformance with safe boot – with a greater than normal mass of external swap files – is remarkably good. So I'd like to experiment with: \n\n\n*\n\n*an equally unrestrained approach to swap files with a normal boot.\n\n\nQuestion\nHow can I make the operating system behave in a way that causes a greater than normal mass of swapfiles to be created by dynamic_pager? \nI'm prepared to accept the risks that may be associated with evil tuning. \nRelated\nWhy might more memory be wired in safe mode than in normal mode?\nAnswers there may help towards answers here. \n\nPreliminary investigation\nI ran sysctl -a in normal mode and safe mode. I see differences but (unless I'm missing something) nothing to explain the freedom that's associated with a safe boot.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/72732/8546 by @Quantumpanda is thought-provoking but the question there is, in a way, the opposite of what I want. \nIn Server Fault, FreeBSD performance tuning. Sysctls, loader.conf, kernel is popular but much of that seems network-oriented. \nFirst experiments\nThe essence of this question was originally: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get dynamic_pager to behave with a normal boot as it behaves with a safe boot?\n\n\n– and so I experimented with values for -S and -H. \ndynamic_pager option -S\nIn 2003, when -H and -L were hire_point and layoff_point, the default file_size was 20000000 Mac OS X in a nutshell, page 595). For more recent versions of the operating system, some users prefer a filesize that's around fifty times greater, 1.07 GB on disk: \n\n\n*\n\n*1073741824\n\n\ndynamic_pager option -H\nWith and without a value for -S, I experimented with various high-water-trigger values, including the one suggested by dynamicpagerwrapper: \n\n\n*\n\n*209715200\n\n\nNone had the required effect. \n\nReferences\nAddressing The Outmoded Swapping And Paging Strategy in OSX? | dropsafe (2010-03-01, updated in 2012)\ndynamic_pager_wrapper source from dynamicpagerwrapper – \nperformance wrapper for /sbin/dynamic_pager on OSX\nIn the Mac Developer Library: \n\n\n*\n\n*Memory Usage Performance Guidelines: About the Virtual Memory System\n\n*Kernel Programming Guide: Memory and Virtual Memory\n\nA: AFAIK the reason all those swap files were created so quickly in Safe Mode is because dynamic_pager fell back to an initial swap size of 64MB.  How many swap files did you see?  How many do you want to see?  How many are you seeing?   \nRight now on my Mac Pro (desktop) running OS 10.8.3 I have 7 swap files (numbered 0-6).  Is that what you want?  Actually, since you've pointed this out, I'm going to try to reduce that to 2.  \nIf you really want to create a lot of swap files, just set -S 67108864\nBTW, 1073741824 = 2^30 = 1 GiB\nFollowup\nTurns out there is a bug in dynamic_pager (at least under Mountain Lion 10.8.4) where setting -S 2147483648 (= 2 GiB) fails because of some sort of 32-bit conversion error.  \nCannot extend paging file size /private/var/vm/swapfile0 to 18446744071562067968!\n\n2147483648 as a 32 bit signed in is actually -2147483648 or 0x80000000 which gets extended to a 64 bit number by extending the MSB and turned into 0xFFFFFFFF80000000 which is then converted to a 64 bit unsigned which is 18446744071562067968 or 2 GiB * 8 GiB.   Crazy.  So after you mess with the dynamic pager options, look for error messages in the console logs.\n", "Q: Is there a maximum length of metadata that can be written in one xattr command?

It's usually better to get an app that can index the files you want indexed rather than stuff duplicate data into the resource forks / metadata.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to search LaTeX -documents in Spotlight?\nThe question above shows how to use mdls to pick apart the file classification of the data files you want to index and then how to get an importer into the spotlight system to handle that file type reported so that you get that file type within the mdimport -L listing so you are indexing the contents of all the files you wish to include.\n", "Q: Mac beeping every minute, exactly My Mac (a MacBook Air, though I doubt that's relevant) has for the last few weeks been beeping (giving the alert noise, that is) every minute, exactly.

I've tried shutting down various programs and background processes to see if I can eliminate the source, but that hasn't turned up anything yet.\nOnce it starts I can't find any way to stop it, but apparently it is not 100% consistent, because (oddly enough!) it is not running right now.   Nonetheless, it happens often enough that in retrospect it seems like it happens all the time.  The only work-around I've found is to turn the alert volume all the way down, but of course that's not a solution since there are times when there are real alerts, and I want to hear those.\nWhat could cause a Mac to beep every minute?\n\nA: SoundBunny is a new app that I have just learned about.

(2010 model) I have a 2010 MacBook pro 2.26 GHZ, 2GB Ram. Let me detail a bit of background first.\nI had it running Leopard, and had the same issue with it running slow. I got annoyed with how it was running, so I wiped the HDD. I used DBAN on it, then installed Leopard from disk, then purchased Lion. I did this 2 days ago.\nThe only apps I have on my Mac, that I've installed, right now are:\n\n\n*\n\n*FireFox\n\n*Logic Pro 9\n\n*Native Instruments Komplete\n\n\nAnd that's the only applications I've installed. Currently the only apps I have running are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox\n\n*iMessage\n\n\nIn the activity monitor FireFox is using 560MB ram with 2 tabs open. I get the same when I use Safari, or Chrome.\nWhen I switch applications on the Mac, or even switch tabs on FireFox, I get the spinning wheel. When I open a new application it takes a long time to open. I can't have anything else open if I'm browsing the web because it's painfully slow switching tabs, and even rending pages is slow (it's not an Internet issue).\nThe Mac seems to be always Indexing. When it's indexing it's not even usable.\nI can't understand why this is happening. I have an older iMac that performs better than this Mac.

If you need any information from me leave a comment and I'll update the post.\n\nA: Aside of getting more RAM, you can do following.\nDisabling the flash in your Firefox will save you some.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashblock/\nTo your third question:\nOn my OS x 10.8 the \"kernel\" alone uses 1 gig already!! so you are definitely running short on RAM. \nJust get another 2 Gig and see it fly.\n\nA: \nI can't understand why this is happening. I have an older iMac that performs better than this Mac. I'm ready to sell it, I've had enough of Mac laptops, they just seem to cause constant headaches.\n\nWithout having some degree of understanding in the field of computer science or programming, this would be a little difficult to explain.\n\nThere is no reason why a web browser should be consuming so much RAM with two tabs open (one being bit.ly the other being Stack Exchange).\n\nThe reason is that the programmers have an expectancy of computers to be kept up to date as they build more resource hungry and intensive software. Times have changed and people need to keep up to date. The minimum amount of RAM I would suggest is 4GB as you are using OS X 10.8 which is a 64-bit native system. 2GB is OK if you are using a 32-bit system. Most applications built for OS X these days are of the understanding that you probably have 4GB of RAM that can be used and allocated.\n\nA: As mentioned in the other answers, 2Gb. is quite tight for OS X (or Windows, for that matter) nowadays. Every time you switch apps, your OS is having to hit the swap file on disk to store the memory of the \"outgoing\" program, and loading the memory for the new program. And of course, HDs are slow.\nSince we're on the subject, by the way, it wouldn't be out of place to check if your HD is dying. Go to Disk Utility and see if it passes the SMART test; download also something like Smart Utility and run it. A HD with failing sectors might run slower than usual too.\n", "Q: Mass deleting email from an iPhone/iPad? Is there a workaround for the iOS inability to easily delete ALL (or large blocks of) email from my iPhone and iPad ?\n\nA: The fastest way to delete groups of messages in the iOS mail app is to hit the edit button in the mailbox view, and tap the circles to select the messages you want, the delete/archive them.\nIf that's still too slow for the quantity of mail you have, the best option is likely to use the web interface for your provider (i.e. Gmail, etc.), which will likely allow you to do a select all.\n\nA: Without jailbreak?

There is a well-documented design and/or materials defect in at least some iPhone 5 devices that causes the sleep/wake button (sometimes also referred to as the \"lock\" button or \"power\" button) to stop working reliably.[1]  [2]  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] My iPhone 5, purchased the day after they initially became available, was just replaced yesterday due to this problem.\nMy question is, has Apple fixed the underlying issue in newer devices leaving the factory?\n\nA: Apple have not announced any changes in their manufacturing process, nor do they seem to think they have a quality control problem.\nConsequently, you do not have any reason to believe that new iPhone 5 units should be more or less reliable than ones they made in the past. If you were happy with their products before, there is no reason to expect you should not continue to be so; if you found their process unreliable before, you have no reason to expect things to be better now.\nThere's always a chance anyone could get a bad unit, in which case your satisfaction with their customer service policies would then be what matters.\nLots of us think they're making their phones quite well, but if you're dissatisfied, they haven't given any reason for you to think they've changed anything, so maybe you'd be happier with a different product.\n\nA: I would say the documented issues are anecdotal from the references you have provided. Even if I'm wrong and there is a widespread problem with QC/materials, what problem are you attempting to solve? If your current device works, there's no problem. If your device fails - you take it in for service. Put plainly, no one here has sufficient data to predict how reliable any one phone may be with the variables known to be at play.\nThis would be like asking if a tire manufacturer has fixed the \"flat tire problem\" and sharing experiences where someone felt that a tire of a certain brand or price should have lasted over some short tacks and not flatted.\nAs a consumer, you have the choice to self-insure and risk that you will have to pay for a repair once the manufacturer warranty expires. You can also sign up for extended coverage and protection (and the cost, convenience, and coverage details of those plans vary widely around the globe), so you can control for replacement costs without knowing which factory made your phone, what QC processes may or may not have been in place and whether the people working that shift did their job or did not do their job.\n\nA: Yes, Apple has fixed this problem.\nApple has acknowledged the problem and is offering to repair devices that were manufactured with this defect. According to Apple, iPhone 5 models manufactured through March 2013 may be affected by the defect. You can go to Apple's support site to see if your device qualifies for repair and, if it does, to get instructions for how to get your phone repaired.\nSo if you have an iPhone 5 with a failing sleep/wake button, put the device's serial number into the form on Apple's sleep/wake button replacement program page to find out if you can get your device repaired free-of-charge.\nNote that the device must have a qualifying serial number and must actually be exhibiting the problem to qualify for repair. I have an iPhone 5 device that was given to me in mid-April 2013 as a replacement for an early iPhone 5 device that suffered the sleep/wake button failure after about 6 months of use. The sleep/wake button on the replacement iPhone 5 has worked now for over a year and is not experiencing the failure. Even though I put the device's serial number into the form on Apple's sleep/wake button replacement program page and it indicated that my replacement device is eligible for repair, it probably won't actually qualify for repair because the button is working just fine. But it's nice to know that, should my current device also experience this failure in 6 to 12 months, Apple will repair it even though the device is otherwise out-of-warranty.\nSome other caveats to note (from the replacement program page):\n\nApple may restrict or limit repair to the original country of\n  purchase.\nYour iPhone 5 must be in working order to qualify for this program.\nIf you believe you have paid for a replacement due to this issue,\n  contact Apple regarding a refund.\nThis worldwide Apple program does not extend the standard warranty\n  coverage of the iPhone.\nThe program covers iPhone 5 models for 2 years after the first retail\n  sale of the unit.\n\n\nA: As someone who is also a Genius at an apple store I won't say it's a 'known problem' or a 'well documented problem'. I've seen sleep wake buttons fail on every phone out of box and this is no different, just like you could be unfortunate enough to have a phone that doesn't turn on out of the box. \n\nA: The \"Sleep/Power/Lock\" button is definitely not reliable.\nI've had my iPhone 5 since March 2013 and now it's not working consistently. Also, I went to the Apple service center and another person was leaving his for repair. The service guys told me basically that it is my fault. What!? I've got zero scratches, dents, and the button is pristine clean. I have to leave my phone for repair for two weeks. My other phones of other brands (HTC and Samsung) no problems in years, even Nokia doesn't suffer these problems.\nChecking online about this issue, turns out that the manufacturing fault (due to an ultra-delicate component, perhaps) is present since iPhone4.

There I can add MAC addresses of client devices that can access my network.\nI've added my iPhone's MAC address to this list, but my iPhone doesn't detect my network. What can I do to allow my phone to detect my network?\n\nA: If you don't see your network's SSID in the iPhone's list of Wi-Fi networks, you can always try the Other option in the Wi-Fi settings screen to manually input the SSID and security settings.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you'll probably want to turn on SSID broadcast and temporarily disable your MAC filtering to troubleshoot the issue.\n\nA: Do you have broadcasting of SSID turned on?\nIf no, turn it on at least until you connect your iPhone to this network.\nTurn off MAC address filtering until you connect your iPhone. Then add your iPhone's MAC address to the list (from the list of connected devices) and turn filtering back on.\nThis way you will be sure you did not misspelled your MAC address.\n\nA: There is also getting very close to your router/base station (this is a real tip) ... and I find that Forget This Network has to be run, otherwise the iPhone hangs onto the 169.xxx.xxx address forever and the user doesn't know it ...\nI hope, as well, you are using Airport Utility.

I open Terminal and its window shows up but immediately close and its icon remains in the dock. It's working fine a moment ago. I don't know what i have messed. I looked at the log file in the Console application and see \"login: USER_PROCESS 172 ttys000\"\n\nA: I recently had this issue because I uninstalled the version of bash installed by macports (/opt/local/bin/bash) not realizing it was my default shell. The solution was to change my default shell back to /bin/bash via the advanced user options in the Users & Groups System Preferences. (See @sdmeyers' comment on @Pyrolistical's answer for instructions.)\n\nA: This looks as if there is an issue with one of the configuration files for your shell. To fix do\n\n\n*\n\n*With Terminal still running, use Shift-Cmd-N to run zsh\n\n*In zsh run ls -l .bashrc .profile and rename all files you found (mv .bashrc .bashrc.save, mv .profile .profile.save)\n\n*With the window still open, type Cmd-T to open a new tab running bash.\n\n*Assuming this worked, review .bashrc.save/.profile.save (and anything called from there) for errors. You can also rename them back and run login in the running shell which may show some errors from executing the scripts and give you some hints on where to look for problems.\n\n*In case running bash in step 3 didn't work (tab closed again) you may also have to rename /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc with sudo mv /etc/profile /etc/profile.save; sudo mv /etc/bashrc /etc/bashrc.save\n\nA: Try to hide the current ~/.bash_profile from your shell.\nJust rename it to ~/.bash_profile_bkp and see if something changes.\n\nA: What shell are you using?  Try flipping the default one.  I found a bad .profile configuration crashed bash, and temporarily switching to another shell to edit the .profile fixed my issue.\n", "Q: how to execute mkdir in /home/ directory I want to create a directory 'administrator' in my /home/ directory but it won't allow me as it alway returns the error Operation not supported.

Are there any apps which does support full screen windows apps?\n\nA: Have you tried RDP? There are several Remote Desktop apps, eg PocketCloud that can connect to a Windows PC using the native RDP server.\n\nA: Jump Desktop seems to be one of the best iOS clients for streaming in my experience. I prefer Screens for a multitude of reasons when I am doing system administration tasks, but for end users working for hours at a time on Windows via the iPad, Jump seems to be the winner in terms of features, shortcuts and usability.\n", "Q: How to disable the docked Finder monitor pop-up on OS X?

In the image below, iOS shows some figures next to the app name.\n\nI am not sure what this means. Does this indicate network used or disk space used by my app?\nThe problem is my app is not saving any data on phone. It is just using the internet and saving all data on internet only, but then this count is still increasing…\n\nA: This is the amount of data the app is storing on the phone, plus the size of the app. If an app isn't saving data, it may be caching data of some kind. \nWithout getting into code level details, this Storage pane is simply showing the space used by the sandbox (directory) that iOS makes to store each specific app and all the files, temporary files, preference files, caches and other assets as it runs.\nAny user of iOS can look into some of the storage for each app using a tool like PhoneView but to truly look at all the files and determine which folders and files make up the 36.5 MB of the Testing_demo app (for instance), you will either need to jailbreak the iOS device and measure the filesystem directly or make use of the profiling tools in Xcode to analyze the writes made by your app.\n", "Q: Apache VirtualDocumentRoot, MAMP, .local domain & xip.io?

This is definitely and advanced topic and possibly needs a hack that I am willing to do.\nI edit Arabic files quite a lot. Arabic characters displayed by Terminal.app are not playing nice at all. To top that, some custom fonts that I use are getting picked up as alternatives for certain glyphs in my vim sessions.\nThe default font for displaying English works fine and I have no complains about it.\nHowever, I want to change the font picked by Terminal.app when displaying other languages, in my case it is Arabic.\nTo answer this question, one must know if it is even possible. Are the fonts hardwired into the binary? Is there a hack to bypass that?\nUPDATE:\nIt turns out the only hack to solve this problem wasn't a hack. It is the best of what the OS offers for eligible Fixed Arabic Font and that is Courier New. The font can be read very clearly except for \"ARABIC LETER HEH INITIAL FORM\" Unicode FEEB. Hopefully someday someone will fix that letter for better reading in the terminal. Or just copy those glyphs over to Menlo.\n\nA: You can set the font for terminal in the terminal preferences. (Terminal -> Preferences... then select the \"Settings\" tab and \"Text\" sub-tab. Fonts are choses based on profiles so you could set up a profile with an Arabic font.\nYou must have monospaced Arabic font installed. You'll need to to search the internet for one.\nMost important, for using using Vim read this:\nhttp://vim.dindinx.net/orig/html/arabic.txt.php\nThe default version of Vim on the Mac is compiled with \"-arabic\" so it will never give you what you want, you'll need to recompile you own version (try homebrew) also MacVim may work (GUI version of Vim so no terminal necessary).\n", "Q: Multiple games on ipad we are 4 friends and all have games on their iPads that are the same games. How do I get the accounts squared away so they are no playing each others game? For example, everyone has \"Clash of the clans\" on their iPads and they all play the same game. How can we get it so each person can create their own world in the game and not interfere with each others' game?\n\nA: Each person needs their own Game Center Account (and thus each needs a unique Apple ID).\n", "Q: Recent items are showing under \"No Date\" when sorting by date in finder This thing's driving me crazy.\nOften, when I download or create a new file, and then I have to upload it to a website or something like that, it will appear after the oldest items under a \"No Date\" section.\nI'm running Mountain Lion but it happened for me at Lion as well.\nAny ideas how to fix this?\n\n\nA: Understanding the reason for this bug may help people handle it. The bug occurs when applications have been opened on a previous day and stay open overnight. If you use the application on the next day, it'll show files with \"no date\" because - in the context of that application - the file has been created in the future. \nA workaround is to close the application in which you use that \"Open\" or \"Save\" dialogue and open it again. This bug is very annoying and I can't understand why Apple doesn't fix it.  \n\nA: First, Force quit Finder. You can do this by pressing the option+command+esc keys and then selecting Finder from the list and clicking on the Relaunch button.\nThen, try deleting the Finder's preferences file: com.apple.finder.plist, found in ~/Library/Preferences. \nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nThis file seems to easily become corrupt. Trashing it is a good first step when Views become wacky—anything to do with Finder.\n\nA: I don't know if this is really a \"solution\" per se, but it's a workaround that I prefer anyway: I changed the \"Arrange by\" to \"None\" as described here Mac OS X - File Open Dialog: Can't sort or resize columns\nThis gets rid of the categorization by Today/7 days/30 days/etc. altogether, and just gives a straightforward dialog that lets you sort however you want (be it Date Modified, or Name, or Size). I find this much more useful and fail to see the advantage of the other view (which is made almost useless by this No Date bug). \nNote that some applications (e.g., MS Office) do not let you change the Auto-arrange setting. Just open up some other application that does (e.g., Chrome) and set it there (just go to Open File or similar -- you don't have to actually open the file). This action seems to set this setting globally (on 10.8.4). \nThis problem is all over the web. Why does Apple not comment on it? Does it not care about its users? Why does it not release a fix? Is iTunes so much more important? This bug seems almost ludicrous: The arrange-by setting used for categorization is (normally) \"Date Modified\", and the actual modified date is clearly shown in the Date Modified column. Indexing in the general case perhaps needs to happen not in real time (e.g., if you are viewing \"All Files\"), but when we open a dialog, can't just the (usually very few but most important) No Date files be manually indexed in that moment?\n\nA: Just click on Today, and it should update the downloads to their correct date.\n", "Q: HTTP Get is not working stable after Netboot I am booting a Netboot Image with a MacMini 5.1, after the system is up a shell script calls a server via curl.\nAt the moment the Internet connection is up and running. I verify that doing a ping to the same server before using curl.\nEvery now and then it is not working properly. When it is not working the http get request never reaches the server. Since the ping worked before i think it might be a DNS problem.\nIf i use curl \"manually\" 2 time working 3rd time not... Its not easy to reproduce this error...\nSo i tried to add the IP to /etc/hosts and it is still not working properly every time.\nWhat might cause this problem ?\n\nA: Check the return value from curl. If there are problems you should get a non zero value. Something like this may work:\n#!/bin/sh\necho trying download . . .\nuntil curl http://example.com/test.file ; do {\n    echo something went wrong. retrying download . . .\n}; done\necho file downloaded.\n\n\nA: I found the same thing.

We have one iTunes acct for our purchases, etc..When she goes to visit family in Ga. Is there a way she can stream the same music via her dad's home theatre/Apple TV set up. I'm assuming there's an issue related to our iTunes acct vs her dad's iTunes acct. \n\nA: One Computer must activated for a specific iTunes Account. Once the Mac/iPad/iPhone/AppleTV is activated, you have to wait 90 days to switch the account.\nFor example: If your Dad has activated iTunes Match, he has to wait 90 days till your wife can activate iTunes Match on the same device with her account.\nThe solution would be to carry around your iPad and stream it from there. \n\nThere is no sharing between iTunes Accounts. So currently you have no\n  chance to transfer all music from one account to another.\n\n\nA: From an iPhone/iPod/iPad you can stream music to any Apple TV without needing to log in in any way. So as long as your wife doesn't want to copy her music onto her Dad's system she should be fine. \n", "Q: Applescript to run when iPhone connects/disconnects I'm trying to figure out how to run an applescript when I connect and disconnect my iPhone with the USB cable.\nSo far, I think I can run an applescript when it connects by using Image Capture (setting \"connecting this phone opens\" to \"other\" and selecting the script).\nI don't know how to run a script when the phone is disconnected however. Ideas?\n\nA: Is this sort of what you're looking for?\n\nUsbmux\n...usbmuxd then watches for iPhone connections via USB; when it detects an iPhone running in normal mode (as opposed to recovery mode), it will connect to it and then start relaying requests that it receives via /var/run/usbmuxd – this is to say, usbmuxd is the only thing that actually speaks USB to the iPhone.\n\nhttp://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Usbmux\n\nA: The first part of the answer is fairly easy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your AppleScript as a droplet or app to the filesystem.\n\n*Select that app in Image Capture as the tool to open when a specific iOS device is connected.\n\n\nDepending on your need, you can have a suite of scripts, one for each device (or device role) or do some processing to determine the name of the attached device and handle things with logic from within AppleScript.\nThe second part might need a second watcher program that polls the USB ports and then triggers whatever script you wish to run.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion email share option opens a secondary Mail application I am having a weird issue when I use the share functionality baked into Mountain Lion. Whenever I have a file highlighted in finder and choose the email option to share a file with someone, it decides to \"re-open\" Mail. Now this is a problem for two reasons. One, having to start Mail up is an unnecessary waste of time if its already open (I always leave Mail running in a side space), and two, some of my accounts wont refresh because there are two simultaneous connections.\nHere is a screenshot to better illustrate what is happening: \nI select the file, hit share and chose email.\n\nA second Mail app opens and begins to launch displaying the compose box (with the file attached)\n\nIt is also visible twice in mission control:\n\nAs you can see, Mail is open and running twice. Does anyone know why this is happening? It would be nice to find a way to prevent it.\n\nA: The most likely explanation for this is that you have at least two versions of Mail installed (for whatever reason). Your system default mail application happens to be the old version.\nWhen an application uses the sharing API on ML to write an email, it is opened in the default system mail application. This setting, strangely enough, is inside Mail's preferences (not System Preferences).\nUnder the General tab is an item called Default mail reader, which is your system default.\nIn your preferred version of Mail, Open Mail -> About Mail, and note the version. Now select that version of Mail in Mail's preferences for Default email reader.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem, but I do NOT have two copies of the mail app. When it happens, it shows up twice in the dock, but if I right-click the dock icon and choose \"Options -> Show in Finder\" they both show the same \"Mail\" icon in my applications folder.\n", "Q: How can I get iMessage to verify my phone number? iMessage won't verify my phone number. When I try to select my number for messages to be sent, it's greyed out. So I receive my iMessages over email which I don't want to do. \nI've tried: turning iMessage on and off, resetting network settings, rebooting my phone and nothing's worked. \nAny ideas? \n\nA: Looks like you tried all the basic troubleshooting steps.  Heres the next step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your data is backed up, either iTunes or iCloud.\n\n*Turn iMessage off (make sure to do this).\n\n*Erase all contents and settings (this will wipe your device.)   Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Contents and Settings.\n\n*Set the phone up as New (make sure to do this)\n\n*Turn on iMessage, wait for it to activate.  Once it's activated erase the phone again and restore from your backup.\n\n\nA: You need to sign in to iCloud on your iPhone before it can receive messages via iMessage. After you do that, you can even receive iMessages sent to your email address if you register the address with your Apple ID. \n\nA: This was an easy fix for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup on iCloud if you feel like you need to\n\n*Turn off your iMessage\n\n*Go and delete all your network settings\n\n*Let the phone restart\n\n*Turn on the iMessage again, wait for 10 seconds or so\n\n\nA: You must have an active cellular plan on your device and be able to send and receive text messages. If you’re out of cellular coverage, do not have a cellular plan at all, or have SMS blocked on your account for some reason, you will not be able to use your phone number for iMessage or FaceTime, as Apple cannot help.\nCall your carrier and ask them whether SMS are blocked from your phone number. Don't forget update to latest iOS version.\nIf iMessage still cannot verify your phone number, call Apple. \n\nA: With iOS 8, you can toggle iMessage off and on.\n", "Q: Symlink User Folders - Can I keep original Sidebar Icons?

I'm a college student and aspiring Apple developer. As such, I am trying to find an intel Mac Mini for as cheep as possible. I've noticed that there is quite a price gap between the models that can support Mountain Lion (late 2009 and later), and those that can't. Since Lion supports the App Store, do I really need Mountain Lion? \n\nA: Mountain Lion versus Lion is one thing, but it's worth considering that, with Apple's apparent intention of releasing a new major version of OS X every year, a machine that can only run Lion will rapidly fall far behind the baseline. This may make it hard to develop against new SDKs that require the latest version of Xcode.\nBuying an older Mac mini may mean saving money now only to have to spend it sooner than you'd like to remain productive.\n\nA: All depends on the version of XCode you wish to use.\nI believe Lion is currently the minimum requirement for Xcode iOS 5.1\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-5_1/\n", "Q: Photoshop elements 11 I am comparing prices of Photoshop Elements 11 for our new iMac.

I'm experiencing an issue with multiple computers; when trying to connect to a file server on a different domain the user's domain credentials from their current domain are being used, and not the domain credentials needed for that specific file server on the mentioned domain.\nThat's why I would like a solution like the one above known to work with Mountain Lion, which that one is not.\nI've also tried clearing out and removing the keychain, browsing bonjour through Finder (which still allows a \"connect as\" login box to be pulled up) but the server, being on a seperate domain, is not showing up.\nAny known solutions or suggestion? My workaround currently is to \"connect to server\" using afp://username:password@fileserver.domain.com doing that allows proper authentication to occur and/or pops up the username/password dialog prompt. That is a fine workaround for me, but our hundreds of users would not appreciate the added complexity.\n\nA: I just found that if you use IP address instead of name of server 10.8 does prompt you for username / password!\nWhy?

For example, I would type $test123 and it would replace that text with a sentence that I had setup.\nIs there a similar program on the Mac that also works in any browser?\n\nA: I believe you are looking for TextExpander. \nFrom their site: \n\nType more with less effort! TextExpander saves your fingers and your keyboard, expanding custom keyboard shortcuts into frequently-used text and pictures...\n\n\nA: You can do this by setting each replacement word with it's value under System Preferences / Language & Text.\n\nIf after trying it out, it doesn't work, you may need to enable the text substitution feature. To do so just go Edit / Substitution / Text Replacement or right click on a editable field for the edition menu to show up:\n\nYou could, though, enable the text substitution feature on every Application which supports it just by executing this command on Terminal:  defaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true\n", "Q: GarageBand - volume maxing out I have a multi-track mix in GarageBand.

Will it affect the quality of my exported track? If so, how can I deal with this except for individually lower the volume of every track?\n\nA: Yeah, it does result in distortion or clipping. But you can also reduce the master volume:\n\nIf individual tracks were clipped before they were mixed to the master, they will still be clipped though. GarageBand always normalizes volume when you export a song, so you can reduce the master volume as much as you want.\n", "Q: Stop Automatically Switching to Bluetooth Audio I have a pair of headphones that I really like. I also spend over 12 hours a day in front of my MacBook. As such, I prefer to use some voice commands using Speakable Items. However, due to the placement of my MacBook on my desk, I can't use the internal microphone without yelling (can't yell in the lab). \nTherefore, I picked up a bluetooth earphone/mic combo to solve this issue. The earphones are detachable, so I'm using it only as a mic. I've mapped the correct audio-in in the Speech prefpane.\nSo my headphones are plugged into the audio-out port, but when I power up my bluetooth mic, my macbook automatically sets the bluetooth as the audio-out device. This is suboptimal, as I have to manually switch the audio-out device when this happens. Now, I could write an applescript to automatically switch back the audio device when this happens, but that's putting a band-aid on the issue. \nIs there a way to stop my MacBook from automatically switching to the bluetooth headset when it powers on?\nBonus points to solutions that don't disable automatic audio-out switching entirely as I would like my macbook to auto-switch to the external sound card that I plug in when I go home\n\nA: This little menu bar app works for me to quickly switch audio sources:\nAudio Switcher \nIt's more of a Band-Aid then an actual fix of the problem. \nNOTE: This app is not available in all regions.\n", "Q: iOS-iOS device real time sound transfering I'd like to know if there's any way I could connect two iOS devices to transfer sound in real time.

On the other, you have traded $100 to roll the dice and see if software will fix the issue or if you still need to do the backup. You also want to budget for a potential repair, since many drives with this error are failing and need to be replaced.

Has keys from left as:\nctrl    fn    alt opt    cmd <butterfly>\n\nTried Karabiner but it didn't seem to work (tested by using ctrl-F in vi/vim).  Then I found this document https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/getting-started/features which lists a limitation.\n\nKarabiner-Elements cannot modify the fn key on non Apple keyboards such as Logitech keyboards.\n\nNot for Logitech. Ouch.  Other suggestions?  Back to best buy again?  I'm really just looking for a mac layout keyboard with full size keys.  I don't care about the num pad, etc. on right side.  The K850 looked good except for this issue.  Some gentle ergonomics help is good.\n\nA: *\n\n*Download and install Karabiner\n\n*Open Karabiner Elements and set the Target Device in the dropdown\n\n*Map fn to left_control and left_control to fn as below\n\n\nA: You could also add this to private.xml:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::FN, KeyCode::CONTROL_L</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::FN</autogen>\n\nSee the source for the key code values and predefined settings.\n\nA: I'm a new Mac user so I don't know much about how this was solved before. But this seems to be fixed in MacOs Monterey 12.5 (MacBook Pro 16'' 2021). No third application required :)\n\n\nA: Not sure which OS this started appearing in but in macOS 10.13, this can be customized in System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys:\n\n\nA: This is my white whale.  I can't use Emacs without the control key being on the left hand side.  Recently I got a new MacBook so I had a chance to do this without Karabiner.\nThis is what worked for me to rebind the function key to control (for the built-in keyboard only), on macOS 10.15.6.\nhidutil property --matching '{ \"ProductID\": 0x027e }' --set '{\n  \"UserKeyMapping\": [\n    {\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\": 30064771300,\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\": 1095216660483\n    },\n    {\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\": 30064771296,\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\": 280379760050179\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n\nVerify it with hidutil property --matching '{ \"ProductID\": 0x027e }' --get \"UserKeyMapping\".\nHow I found these keycodes\nI've both seen the option to change the Function (fn) Key and not seen the option to change the Function (fn) Key on the same computer, using the same version of macOS.  Take it with a grain of salt, but I can consistently get the variant with the Function (fn) Key option to appear if I:\n\n*\n\n*Have an external keyboard attached, via a USB-Type C hub\n\n*Open the Keyboard → Keyboard → Modifier Keys\n\n*Lock the screen using the external keyboard\n\n*Walk away for some time (wait until the computer sleeps)\n\n*Wake the computer by pressing a key on the external keyboard and use Touch ID to  log in\n\n*Now the Modifier Keys preference has the Function (fn) Key option.  While in this state, change the behaviour of the function key using the drop down list (I chose ^ Control)\n\n*Copy ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences.${__UUID__}.plist (described here) somewhere else temporarily\n\n*Convert the binary PList to XML: plutil -convert xml1 .GlobalPreferences.${__UUID__}.plist\nContents of that file are:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping.1452-638-0</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst</key>\n            <integer>30064771300</integer>\n            <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc</key>\n            <integer>1095216660483</integer>\n        </dict>\n        <dict>\n            <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst</key>\n            <real>30064771296</real>\n            <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc</key>\n            <integer>280379760050179</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis page shows up if you search for these HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc and says that 1095216660483 is for the left function key, 280379760050179 is for the right.\nI thought I was going crazy so I took some screenshots for proof:\nModifier Keys preference pane without the  Function (fn) Key option\n\nModifier Keys preference pane with the Function (fn) Key option\n\nAbout ProductID\nYou can find the Product ID associated with your keyboard using the System Report button: Apple menu → System Report → Hardware → USB.\nIf you use the --matching parameter to hidutil using a specific Product ID, the changes will affect that piece of hardware only.

I use it to remap fn ⇥ to ⌃ ⇥ and fn ⇧ ⇥ to ⌃ ⇧ ⇥.\n\nA: Looks like the one way to make Karabiner work with Logitech keyboards is to uninstall Logi Options, but then:\n\n*\n\n*the keyboard will behave like standard Apple keyboard - the mapping of function keys will differ from pictograms (I guess these can be remapped with Karabiner)\n\n*you will need to find another way to configure mouse buttons 3-5.\n\n", "Q: Symlink to hidden file I have 2 macs, and use Dropbox a lot. On my MacBook I have one folder synced with Dropbox (through a symlink, ln -s ~/folder ~/Dropbox) that is actually in my ~/Library directory, so it's hidden. It was a while ago, but I somehow got symlinks to work for it (I cant remember how now!). On my new iMac when I do it, the symlink file won't work, because it's linking to a file it doesn't have permission to see (needs sudo password).\nCan anyone remind me how I did this (or show me a new way?).. Thanks\nEDIT:\nAs pointed out, ~/Library is not hidden at all :) ... I have no idea why Dropbox won't upload it then. This happened before on my MacBook, and I can't remember what I did to fix it..\n\nA: Symlinks work for hidden files. \nWhen you \nln -s ~/hiddenfile  ~/folder/hiddenfile\nthere is a new file. But of course, you can't see it. \n\nIf the files name begins with a point (\".vimrc\"), you can't see it\n  because finder doesn't show files with a point before the actual name.\n\n", "Q: Is there a free analogue clock that displays in the dock? I would like to have an analogue clock displaying right in my OS X dock.\nThe default clock in the menu bar is too small for me, and it is obviously impossible to drag it into the dock.\nIf possible, I prefer a free (as in beer) solution.\n\nA: Andrew Choi's SimpleDockClock does this, although it is not straightforward to change the style.\nIt looks like this:\n\nThe source code and a binary are available.\n", "Q: How can I input ctrl+` (grave accent)? Normally when typing `, I have to hold shift down and press ´, and a \"dead\" version of the grave accent appears.

I am searching for an iPhone app that controls the music playback volume depending on traveling speed or surrounding sounds. I want this for optimized listening while traveling in my car.\nDoes anybody know of such an app?\n\nA: I do not know of such an app. I have looked extensively, but have not found any that does this specifically.\nApple has a patent for a technology that would, among other things, build in this sort of feature. Think of it as an extension of the proximity sensor on the front of the phone that turns the screen off when your ear is against the receiver. If implemented, the phone would gain much more situational awareness. I say 'if' because I'd expect to hear something about this during a product announcement.\nThe full text of the patent (#8384684) is available here. EDIT: this is a related patent, but not the one I intended to attach. I'll correct shortly.\n\nA: I have not tried it but I found this $5 app when searching for “Speed control volume”\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/volume-by-velocity/id1042222781?mt=8\n", "Q: How can I restrict access to certain Preference Panes? Several of the preference panes on my Mac at work have are translucent and when I hover over them I get the following message:\n\nYour system administrator has not given you access to this preference pane.\n\nHow is this configured? I'd like to do the same for my machine at home that my niece and nephew use.\nClarification: On my Mac at work: National IT for my organization created the original image (I'm with local IT). I'm guessing when they created the image they used some admin configuration tool (similar to Group Policy on windows?).\n\nA: Parental controls looks like a good answer for my needs.\nHowever, what my work has used for restricting accounts is MCX policies applied through Workgroup Manager.\n\nA: There are a couple of really easy ways of having somehow restricted accounts, one with non-administrator privileges or one which has Parental Controls.\nThe first one is a regular account without the privileges of making changes on a system level, while the parented controlled accounts can be configured to have limited access to specific Applications, Resources and can even limit the hours of use. \nTo set a non-administrator account just don't check the Allow user to administer this computer under System Preferences / Users & Groups isit up is quite straightforward. \nSetting a parental controled account is quite straightfoward too. To do so, just go to System Preferences / Parental Controls and follow the instructions.\nBear in mind that you'll need and administrator account to set up and manage either of these. \n", "Q: Powerful external hard disk health checker on Mac? Is there any powerful program in Mac to check the health status - mainly bad sectors - of an external (USB) hard disk, and to recover them?\n\nA: You cannot recover data from a bad sector. Disk Utility will not detect bad sectors, nor will fsck. These will cross check index files on the drive and correct them as needed. \nWhen a hard drive detects a bad sector it's supposed to remap it to a spare sector if a spare sector is available. There can also be weak sectors which are readable by the drive but with great difficulty.\nNONE of the operating system tools will do scans for bad sectors on a hard drive. You need third party tools to do that. Rather than provide a list re-hashing the merits of each I'd ask readers to refer to the list in the following link:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1544280\nEveryone will have their own opinions on which one is best. My guess is that if they made that list, they're good.\nAnother word about external vs. internal HDs. Unless 3rd party support is added, USB and Firewire drives will not be SMART capable. SMART can report a certain number of developing problems with an internal hard drive that may be critical, but they won't get reported if they're on USB/FireWire drives. \nHope this helps.... \n\nA: Two options are already built in\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility from /Applications/Utilities works equally well for internal and for external disks (as long as they are attached via Firewire, USB or Thunderbolt).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are familiar with Terminal, you can also use fsck to check filesystems. To get the device names, first run diskutil list which lists all drives and filesystems and then run fsck -fpy /dev/IDENTIFIER for the actual check.\n\n\n\nBoth tools focus on the filesystem level which usually is not a problem because bad sectors tend to get handled by the drive itself. If you want to go the whole mile there is always Drive Genius which offers extensive options including \"Realtime bad-block scanning and an extended block verification that stress tests the read/write validity\".\n", "Q: Activating unlocked iPhone 4s with SIM but without contract? I'm in a research lab where we're looking to get an iPhone 4s to use as a speedier iPod touch.  We don't want a cell phone contract, and we want to avoid jailbreaking or borrowing a SIM card just for activation (unless it's the only option).\nWhen purchasing the unlocked iPhone, there are options for 'No SIM' and 'T-Mobile SIM (without contract)'.  Searching the internet has shown that unlocking without a SIM isn't possible.  If we get the T-Mobile SIM, will we be able to activate even without a contract ?\n\nA: If you use the T-Mobile SIM it will only activate the device, it will not create a contract.  If you feel safe you can get it without a SIM, head over to the closest Apple Store and ask them to activate the phones using AT&T dummy cards.\nOnce you activate the phones, I suggest putting the phones in airplane mode and turn on Wifi, otherwise the phone will constantly be searching for signal which will cause the battery to drain.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Manage iPhoto on external hard disk Most of my Mac hard drive is filled with iPhoto pictures. I have an external USB hard drive. What to do? Just moving pictures from Pictures/iPhoto Library is not a perfect option as I want to have some newer pictures on my Mac. \niPhoto supports to have two libraries, and I am quite happy with that option. I can copy whole library to external disk and then remove pictures older than a year from local iPhoto library. \nHowever I have two problems: Once I import new pictures, I should copy the whole iPhoto library again (with duplicated files) and also this process should be done manually every time. \nI am looking for a smarter option.

But apparently someone tried to use mine or had some intent to exploit it, and now I am a little paranoid about my iPhone.\nFortunately, I have a very recent backup stored on my laptop and the iOS is up-to-date. I have looked up some references to wipe out the iOS and did factory setting recovery under DFU mode with an ipsw file stored in iTunes. Is this a true complete wipe out of iOS?\n(I want basically jail-break and sudo rm -rf / style wipe out. I don't want any funky business such as malware or virus going on my iPhone...)\n\nA: DFU is the lowest-level erasure that you can perform through iTunes. It will eradicate anything that may have been planted on your phone when it was lost. I'd feel safe if I went through the same process.\n\nA: Take it to an Apple Store.  They will gladly perform a DFU restore, they can also open the phone to inspect and see if there has been some physical tampering. \n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to correct spelling mistakes Is there any way for me to get all of the words detected by the standard OS X spelling checker as mistakes, to be corrected to the first available choice using a keyboard shortcut?\nE.g. I type aqcuired and several words/sentences later I look up from the keyboard and see the typo. Instead of reaching for the mouse or tediously navigating there with the keyboard for a manual correction, I'd like to just hit some key combination and get it to be fixed to the obvious correction acquired...\nAny solution which is applescript based will also do, since I can easily trigger any applescript from the keyboard (using iKey).\n\nA: I couldn't come up with anything better than this:\n--delay 0.3\n--activate application \"TextEdit\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)\n    set wasshown to title of windows contains \"Spelling and Grammar\"\n    keystroke \"w\" using option down\n    if not wasshown then keystroke \":\" using command down\n    tell (window 1 where title is \"Spelling and Grammar\")\n        delay 0.05\n        try\n            select row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1\n        end try\n        click button \"Change\"\n        if not wasshown then click button 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nFor the keystroke command to work, create ~/Library/Keybindings/ and save this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"~w\" = selectWord:;\n}\n\nOther methods weren't really usable when for example the word under the caret was not underlined.\nMany words don't have any suggestions.

I'm reading my exchange email via the Apple Mail app. The messages are indexed by spotlight but the contents of the attachments are not.\nAny idea how I can enable/fix this?\n\nA: Spotlight is now indexing the attachments :-). What I did is the following. (Not sure if it will solve anybody else his problems but you never know) \nI wanted to know if the issue was Exchange specific so I made a new gmail account and sent an email with an attachment to that account. That attachment got indexed. I opened the attachment and then saw that it was located somewhere deep down in ~/Library/Mail. I then also checked if Attachments were really downloaded by the exchange client by looking for *.pptx files by running \nfind . -name \"*.pptx\"\nin ~/Library/Mail. When I used spotlight after that I all of a sudden could find all attachments in email. So I guess adding the gmail account to mail triggered spotlight somehow\n", "Q: Date/time in terminal correct but one hour off in apps I live in Chile and the government has decided to go to winter time later than usual a few months ago.

I would like to get a second one and use Disk Utility to create a Mirrored RAID Set from both of them so that I have a backup of my data. Both LaCie units would be set to be RAID 0 so that I have maximum space available. Am I able to do what I intend to do?\nMy next question is, assuming I can set them up as a Mirrored RAID Set, would I then be able to swap out a drive on each of them (one at a time, giving the RAID time to rebuild) to increase storage capabilities?\nI'm currently planning on getting two 10TB units as that will supply me with enough storage for quite some time. However, I would like to be able to swap out the smaller drives with larger ones in the future.\n\nA: Firstly, RAID shouldn't include your backups. Something catastrophic hitting one, will hit the other. Eg. fire, burglary, etc.\nIdeally, you want to keep one set off site. Using the 2 disks you can keep one at a friends, and sync the up periodically. There are tools that allow you to do this. Alternatively, something like BackBlaze, Amazon Glacier, will give you huge or unlimited storage that is remote and protected.\nSecondly, when setting up RAID you want to think about your priorities. Are you optimizing for speed, redundancy, etc.\nI you want to have one unit in house, and one remote and periodically updated, you're probably better off with RAID5, which is a better mixture of redundancy and speed.\nFinally, RAID won't allow you to upgrade disks singly.\nAlternatively, using a something like Zevo's ZFS you can configure the Big5 as a JBOD and feed the disks into a ZFS RAIDZ. This will allow you to mix and match disk sizes, and upgrade over time. It will also keep better control of your disks, checksum all the data, and a host of other features.\nPersonally, I'm a big fan of the ZFS approach, as I think the performance and security are better than a plain RAID.\nRAIDing using OSX software, on top of a RAID in the LaCie box is asking for some complex failure.\n", "Q: Why can I no longer get an internet connection when using my old Macbook and AirPort Express? Up until recently I was using my 2007 MacBook perfectly fine with my old AirPort Express. A few days ago I purchased a used mid-2010 iMac which is now running OS X 10.8.3 (something I'm still not too sure I like). When I first brought the iMac home and connected to my network it did so just fine but the AirPort icon in the menu bar showed there was no internet connection, despite the signal being full. I then followed some step-by-step setup which rebooted the AirPort Express and all of a sudden I had internet! Great! …except since then my MacBook has the same problem my iMad had, i.e., it connects to the network just fine but the network icon shows no internet connection :(\nI should mention that my MacBook is running OS X 10.6.8. I'm wondering if this is an OS compatibility issue or… Has anyone experienced something similar?\n\nA: Setting the AirPort Express b/g to g-only mode solved this problem for me, though I don't understand why.\n", "Q: How to make my Garage Band '11 ringtone louder? I created a ringtone using Garage Band '11 and my bass directly inputted to my MAC. I was able to create the ringtone I wanted, and selected the 30 second loop, however the volume is really low. I've tried bumping up the volume on both the track and the monitor locations but still way lower than, say a purchased ringtone.\nAnyone know of a place I may be overlooking? \nUPDATE: \nI adjusted the settings in preferences under Audio/MIDI\nAnd I also unchecked Export Projects at Full Loudness just to see if there was any difference in the output. But it sounded identical to the previous export:\n\n\nA: I found a solution that works for me. Thanks to bmike for pointing me in the right direction. What I used was the Visual EQ to bump up the Output level of my master track. The Visual EQ is found under Master Effects of the Master Track window:\n\nI adjusted to taste and boom!

There is no RJ45 / ethernet port on my macbook.  Do I need a thunderbolt or USB or HDMI adaptor?\nOr should I just buy a mini wireless router?\n\nA: Your best bet is Apple's Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter.\nThere are also assorted USB ethernet adapters available from various sources (including Apple), including a few Gigabit ones that use USB 3.0, but the Thunderbolt one will likely have the best performance, so unless you're using both Thunderbolt ports already, that's the better choice.\n", "Q: Vanishing images in Notes browser app What I like about Apple's note app is that it supports pictures. However, when I use the browser interface, the pictures disappear after I inserted them and switch to another note. Also, they are not downloaded to the Notes desktop app.\nIs there something I could do about it? \n\nA: I don't think the web interface (iCloud) supports adding pictures (yet). The only way to add pictures to a note is using notes.app from the Applications folder, but you figured that out already.\n", "Q: Ethernet Cable vs Wireless adaptor What are the advantages / disadvantages of the \"Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adaptor\" over something like the \"Apple AirPort Express\"?\nAs a frequent traveller (with a retina-macbook-pro) I am simply looking for a lightweight and reliable way to connect to a wired network.\n\nA: Thunderbolt Adapter\nPros\n\n\n*\n\n*Cheaper\n\n*No software configuration\n\n*Faster (although depending on the speed of the internet connection, this may be less of a factor)\n\n*More reliable (no interference, etc.)\n\n\nCons\n\n\n*\n\n*Only usable with Macs with Thunderbolt\n\n*Mac is physically tethered to the cable\n\n*Sharing connection with other devices requires leaving the Mac on all the time\n\n\nAirport Express\nPros\n\n\n*\n\n*Works with any device that has Wi-Fi\n\n*Multiple devices can be connected at once, without additional setup\n\n*Allows your device to be free of wires\n\n\nCons\n\n\n*\n\n*More expensive\n\n*Requires some configuration\n\n*Requires an additional power outlet\n\n*More gear to keep track of\n\n*Subject to interference from other Wi-Fi networks\n\n\nIf all you need to do is connect to a wired network, the Thunderbolt Adapter is probably the way to go. It's really no different than plugging into a dedicated ethernet port on older machines.\nYou should really only consider the Airport if you definitely need wireless capability or other devices need access when the Mac may not be available. Your Mac can create its own hotspot to share the ethernet connection with other devices, (like an iPhone).\n\nA: Speed is the biggest differentiator. The thunderbolt adapter is capable of 1Gbps, whereas the AirPort express would only be capable of 802.11n which is 300Mbps on good days. Both capable of serving most home/office internet connections, if speed isn't a concern, the next issue would be portability - obviously with the thunderbolt adapter, you would be tethered to the wall by the cable.\n", "Q: Any reason not to run my Macbook Pro upside-down in clamshell mode? My MacBook Pro gets stupidly hot when I'm working on it normally (not clamshell). I am worried that the heat could damage the screen if I use it in clamshell mode. \nI thought that I could place it upside down (in the sense that the Apple logo and LCD panel lie flat on the table) on a non-slip surface so that the heat would vent right out of the (now) top and away. Could I knacker the fans by running them upside down?\nThe laptop is a 15\" MacBook Pro with retina display.\n\nA: You can place the Mac in whatever orientation you like during clamshell mode as long as it's supported and protected from falls.\nI really like the Book Arc stand so that the trackpad area is by the table and all the warmer section near the hinge is up and exposed on all sides to airflow. If you really need maximum cooling, try the SVALT D cooling stand.\nYour proposed mechanism should be measurably cooler when you have the CPU generating maximum heat and for some reason the airflow / ambient temperature wasn't cooling things as much as you had hoped. The air trapped in the LCD panel can have a fairly good insulation value and if the surface is soft, airflow under the feet is diminished.\nThe Apple fans are high quality and likely magnetically suspended or have so little play it's not a concern unless you have shocks or other accelerations.\n\nA: One reason I can think of is that while the bottom is protected by rubber feet, the top is exposed. While you may think the surface you're placing your Mac on may look clean, it's possible that there's some grit that will scratch your Mac when it moves. A non-slip surface might mitigate this somewhat, but you may also want to invest in a skin to protect your computer.\n\nA: The heat is unlikely to damage the screen (I've run mine in clamshell mode for a long time) and I'd be concerned about damaging the finish.  \nAn alternate solution: If you have the room, open the laptop and place a magnet on top of the case near the batter meter or auto port area (I don't know exactly where the sensor is on the retina but that's where it is on my MacBookPro8,2).  It will think the lid is closed while still allowing for vertical convective and radiant cooling.\n\nA: If heat is your concern, I recommend the Griffin Elevator Stand. I use it personally and prefer it over my previous laptop stands because of how exposed the underside of the laptop it is. 2 (rubber padded) metal brackets are all the block the bottom of the laptop, allowing for great air circulation.\n\nA: I have read about MacBook Air's that clock down the CPU slightly when in clamshell mode.

When viewing the songs, sort by the date added field. (You can add columns by right clicking any information header in the song list and adding check marks to the menu that shows).\nSince the exact steps vary based on your OS and the version of iTunes, you can add that to your question or use iTunes help on importing songs from the computer folders and it will show you how to add those missing songs to the Library database that iTunes maintains.\nOnce you have an imported song, you can use iTunes to add titles and albums so that the storage on your filesystem is proper.\n\nA: You can use the keyboard shortcut, Command + i to edit information about your songs.\n\nA: Adding Operating System and iTunes version is beneficial, as well the kind of searching you already did.\n\n\n*\n\n*in iTunes, make a smart list (right-click the + button downleft)\n\n*make a rule like this: [date added] [is in the last] X [days]\n\n*click OK, and you'll find a smart list of most recently added numbers (if not, change 'X' to a bigger number).\n\n\ngood luck.\n\nA: Use Media Monkey\nIt seemed to find tags/titles better than anything else I've used before.\nCheers\n", "Q: OSX Server File Sharing - Allow users to change password? We are running OSX Server 10.7.5 in our small office. On the machine, in the Server application, I have each employee setup as a user, with file sharing turned on.\nThis allows each employee to login to the server via Finder and access shared files.\nIs it possible to allow these users to change their passwords somehow? Or is the only way to do it, to give the Admin their new password and he enters is into the Server app for that user (which is a horrible idea imo)?\nAlso, on our server, these users are NOT users on the OS itself, they are only users in the Server application. The only user on the OS is Administrator.\nA while back at a different company I remember accessing an OSX File share via Finder and it asked me to change my password. So I thought there was an option for an Admin to set this for a user in the file sharing, but I can't find it anywhere. Basically looking for some sort of \"Force user to change password on next login\" checkbox...\n\nA: I think you would need to make them actual users, and then give them screen sharing access to the system.\nOr, you could give them SSH access and write some kind of shell script (perhaps embedded in an Automator/AppleScript application) that changes the password using unix tools.\nOr, you could enable Apache server and write a PHP application that changes the password from a webpage. This is what I would do but it's only a good idea if you're capable of doing this in a secure fashion.\n\nA: The users should get a \"Change Password\" button in the authentication dialog when they connect to the server (see the screenshot in section 1 of this MacWorld article. If your users are set up to connect automatically, they may be skipping this dialog, but they should be able to manually disconnect and reconnect, and get the change password option.\nYou can also set a password policy to require users to change their passwords. The easiest way to do this is with Workgroup Manager, which in 10.7 is part of the Server Admin Tools package. Install it on the server, run Workgroup Manager, authenticate as the directory administrator, select the user(s) you want to force password changes for, then select the Advanced tab, click the Options button, and select \"Password must: Be changed at next login\".\nNote: if the Options button is dimmed, you may not be authenticated as the right administrator. If I understand your setup right, you have Open Directory service set up as a master, and you'll have a separate Directory Administrator account you need to use here. Click the padlock near the top right of the WGM window, and reauthenticate as needed.\n", "Q: Unable to play copied AVCHD I have a Flash drive accessory for my camcorder which allows me to record to it as well as the SDHC cards it also uses as media.\nThis Flash drive can be connected to a computer using a USB connection and is recognised as an external hard drive formatted as FAT32, containing a single AVCHD folder (containing the video).\nI have my own external USB Hard Disk, formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Case Sensitive) and wish to copy my video to that drive for storage, so that I can clear the camera Flash drive for future use with my camera.\nI copied the video by dragging it in Finder, however, the new copy will not open in QuickTime; instead a message box \"cannot open\" appears.\nAfter doing lots of comparisons, I was able to see that the contents of both copies were exactly the same, with the exception that one file: AVCHD/BDMV/INDEX.BDM had changed case (to AVCHD/BDMV/index.bdm).\nUpon renaming this file, Finder no longer associated the file with QuickTime, but if I copied the file, so that I had both INDEX.BDM and index.bdm, it worked correctly.\nMy question is: what is going on here? Why did the case of that file and only that file change during the copy? Why does QuickTime expect it to be one case and Finder another?\n\nA: The index.bdm file was probably named that way on the original card, but appeared as INDEX.BDM when mounted on the Mac. FAT32 is not case-sensitive, and OS X's file system code (specifically the NSFileManager class) programmatically presents FAT32 contents in uppercase. OS X can open AVCHD content, even with a filename in lowercase, from case-insensitive media, like FAT32 or HFS+ in its default, case-insensitive mode.\nHowever, when you copied the AVCHD content to a case-sensitive filesystem, the true nature of that lowercase filename becomes visible (it doesn't get renamed as lowercase, it simply gets revealed as lowercase to begin with!). OS X / QuickTime get confused by the lowercase name, and you get the dreaded \"CANNOT OPEN\". \nThe fix is to ensure that all the AVCHD-standard files and folders are in uppercase. As you see, the folder tree above the INDEX.BDM files loses its special status, but the INDEX.BDM file can be double-clicked to open the AVCHD browser. Just as importantly, editors like FCP X and FCP 7's Log and Transfer window will properly see the media even on the case-sensitive filesystem.\nI encountered the same thing copying AVCHD to a Linux-based NAS with a case-sensitive filesystem. In my case, my Panasonic cameras will write an INDEX.BDM file when I erase all clips or format the card in-camera, but if I erase just one or a few clips, the file gets written as index.bdm. Since Apple's code breaks with mixed-case AVCHD filenames, I'm writing a utility to walk my folder trees and make sure everything is uppercase, grumble grumble...\n", "Q: symbolic link not created All my docs are in:\n/Users/Joe/Documents/Mydocs\n\nI want to put them on dropbox through symbolic link so I created this empty folder:\n/Users/Joe/Dropbox/Mydocs\n\nThen used this command to create a symbolic link:\nls -s /Users/Joe/Documents/Mydocs /Users/Joe/Dropbox/Mydocs\n\nThe destination folder is still empty, what can I do to properly make the link?\n\nA: As Vincent points out, the proper command is ln -s, not ls -s. In addition to that, ln will throw an error if the target of the link (in this case, the Mydocs folder in Dropbox) already exists.\nThe proper way to do this is to delete /Users/Joe/Dropbox/Mydocs, then run ln -s /Users/Joe/Documents/Mydocs /Users/Joe/Dropbox/Mydocs.\n\nA: Your command is wrong.\nIt is not ls -s, but ln -s\n", "Q: Where do I find the full man page for afplay In Terminal afplay -h shows full help text but the man page shows hardly nothing.\nIs there any way to get a longer help page for man afplay?\n\nI never use Terminal and it would be much easier if i could see this longer complete man page in Man Viewer or if there would be some kind of AppleScript or unix script which reads it from somewhere and then shows it or re-writes the man page.\nSome other unix apps has this problem too and it would be nice if it works for all apps with short man page.\nI wanted to use afplay long time ago, but when i saw its short man page i didn't start to use it because i didn't know it has all those settings which are listed in Terminal.\n\nA: No afplay comes with a short (incomplete) man page.\nYou could open a bug report request but I doubt it will taken into consideration or you could use the content of the afplay -h to re-write the man page.\n\nA: https://www.unix.com/os-x-apple-/267933-osx-afplay-command-line-audio-player-_manual_.html has more detail than actual (lame) manpage.\nI found the following useful:\n\n-v is a floating point value between 0.0, volume minimum, and 1.0, volume maximum.\n  This is NOT a linear scaling but relative to a logarithmic output volume level, so do NOT assume a value 0.5 is literally half volume.\n-t is an integer OR floating point value of arbitrary length inside the full playing time ofthe file to be played.

My father would always scold me that so many applications are open when he turns on the computer which he says consumes computer memory. I always forget to close the app by right -clicking>quit Is there any way to automatically close an app when shutting down? When I searched at google. They talked about iCalendar, but it was too confusing so I came here to ask. \n\nA: Basically all apps will be closed when shutting down, simply because the computer will be turned off. Just to be sure: Shutting down means: Turning the computer off.\nHowever the behavior after rebooting differs depending on the operation system version you are using. If you are running Lion or Mountain Lion there is a feature that allows to automatically  restart all open applications after rebooting/start up. In Mountain Lion you will be asked before the computer shuts down if you want the applications to be restarted after reboot. Just uncheck the checkbox.\n\nIf you're confusing shutting down with standby and/or sleep mode you will have no built-in way to solve it (but an AppleScript may help). But at least I can provide you with a shortcut: Pressing ⌘ Command Q will \"completely\" close an application. You can use this shortcut instead of right clicking the dock icon to close the app.\n\nA: If you are using mac os x lion or later, which you apparently do, you can just uncheck the \"reopen windows when logging back in\" when the log-out or shut down menu comes up!\nThis way your perviously opened app won't open again! \nIf they do... you have certain applications set as a* login item\nthis is fixed by opening system pref - users & groups - login items and review that list.\n", "Q: How can I find the macOS version codename?

I have a Page Layout document. I need to remove the header and page numbering from the title page. So, I want to insert a section break after the title page. The problem is, I cannot do that. No matter where I click in the document - page one, page two, a textbox/shape/outside of them on page one or two, when I click the Insert menu -> \"Section Break\" is greyed out.\nI searched everywhere, but I constantly stumble to threads where people discuss how to remove headers/pages numbers from the first page rather than how to actually insert the section break. I think the problem might be that I use Page Layout and not Word Processor, but I am not sure. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: You can't!\nYou can't insert a section break in a layout document because layout documents don't have sections; each page it its own section. See Creating Sections:\n\nIn a page layout document, each page is one section. You can use the predefined sections as they are, or you can modify or remove them one page at a time.\n\n\nA: I figured it out. My problem was that I wanted to remove the headers and footers/page numbers from the title page. Everywhere I search the solution was to insert a section break. In a Page Layout document, as David Pearce points out, there are no section breaks. So what worked out for me is the following:\n1) If you have any headers/footer, you save them somewhere outside your Pages document.\n2) You remove the headers and footers\n3) You switch them back on -> they are empty now.\n4) You go to the page, from where you want the headers and footers to start (in my case the first page after my title page). \n5) You go to the Inspector windows and on the second tab, under Section, you uncheck \"Use previous headers and footers\".\n6) You define your headers and footers on that same page and this way the headers and footers of the title page stay empty, but all other pagers have proper headers/footers and numbering.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2011 Heat Problems This is more a general enquiry into whether I should be concerned, but I have a 2011 Macbook Pro 13\" and over the last week and a half I have noticed the left side of the case (power point, QWE keys down to wrist rest) is getting uncomfortably hot during normal operations.

We manage a large number of iOS devices in an enterprise environment and are finding Apple's management utilities lacking. I wonder if there are any options for jailbreaking which do not entail completely opening the system up.\nI have no intention of thwarting the code-signing system and having to deal with the complications that raises, or installing unauthorized apps; my thoughts are merely that our administration options would be greater if we were able to access the system partition so we could manage plist files through ssh or another tool.\nIs this possible? Or is access to these setting files intrinsically linked to the code-signing system for apps?\n\nA: Old question, and I'm sure you have answered yourself already, but I'll mention the Apple iOS management tool \"Apple Configurator\" (didn't find a good link for a tutorial).\nIt looks like you can lock down a few things.\nOne interest for \"home use\": it's the only way to lock down device pairing. Lets say someone wants the info on your iOS device. If it's unlocked for any reason, you just plug it into some device with iTunes, say \"Trust\" and now you have iTunes-level file system access (which is a lot).\nLATE EDIT: Apple has mostly filled the “iTunes hole” in recent iterations of iOS. You need a password to pair the phone now, and iOS 11.4 seems to want a password every 7 days (much like TouchID requires a password after a bit of time).\n\nA: Jailbreaking is jailbreaking, but you could install tweaks (or hire someone to write them) that patch up on system files and folders.\n", "Q: How to Reset Full-Screen Terminal.app Preferences to Factory Defaults On an iMac running Mac OS X version 10.7.5 I have accidentally resized Terminal.app to full-screen (272 x 76) and am unable to resize Terminal.app to a smaller size.  How do I resize Terminal.app to the factory default size or a size where I can use the mouse to resize Terminal.app?\n\nA: You have (at least) wo possibilities:\n1)\nYou could click on the zoom button to revert the zoom effect (the green circle in the upper left corner in the image below:\n\n2) You can enter smaller values for the window size under \"Preferences\":\n\n", "Q: Apple ID working for iPhone but not for iPad I have an Apple ID and password that has been working fine with my iPhone. I have been able to buy music and download apps with no problems. I bought an iPad and configured it with the same email. I have tried to buy music and download apps using the iPad with the same Apple ID and password but have been unable to connect with the server.\nDo I need a special configuration for the Apple ID in order to be able to use it from different devices?\n\nA: One Apple ID can be used with multiple devices and if you are hitting a limit that too many devices are using it for a specific use (say playing purchased music on too many devices - no slots are left to authorize), you should get an error message.\nThe likely culprit is a network or other device specific error, but you may have to troubleshoot this:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4895\nMost of the authorization issues can be solved starting with the above guide and general troubleshooting might be to check that you can browse the iTunes store and ask the networking staff to make sure things aren't being blocked or take the device to another public internet to be sure it's not a problem with the network and not the device.\n", "Q: Is there a Cydia tweak that gives the camcorder its own button? I have an HTC One V in addition to my iPhone. One thing I love about it is the camera application. It has two buttons: one to capture a photo, and another to capture a video.\n\nI love that you don't have to toggle between them and wait a second or two while it switches. That second or two could cause me to miss the funny things my kids are doing at that moment.\nIs there a jailbreak tweak that brings this same sort of functionality to iOS?\n\nA: This is a four step process that takes less than 3 seconds for me on iOS 6 - so I don't know if anyone's going to tweak this in jailbreak.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the sleep wake button to lock the screen (or wake the screen if the phone is off).\n\n*Press and swipe up on the camera icon on the lock screen.\n\n*Decide if you want video or photo and examine the toggle where you initially pressed the camera icon.\n\n*Tap the toggle if the camera isn't in the mode you prefer.\n\n*Tap the record button.\n\n\nIf you take 3 minutes to practice this, see if training your brain to know it only has to track two places on the phone speeds this up fast enough to avoid needing a dedicated button. The lock button and a very small portion of the screen are the active targets, so you might be able to optimize your speed to start recording knowing that you can start recording as fast as possible and then trim the clip later once the recording starts.\n", "Q: Restoring iPhone I need to restore my iPhone (I use iTunes on Windows 7). I backed-up the backup in MobileSync/Backup to an external drive (thankfully).\nNow I have a long, nonsensically named folder containing the backup files, but when I try to move that directory back into the MobileSync/Backup directory, it isn't showing an available backup to restore on my local system. \nDirectory structure:\n   C:\\Users\\Mike\\AppData\\Roaming\\AppleComputer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\d0474d7f055ed768a337d83f611c26cf6f9517a7\\d0474d7f055ed768a337d83f611c26cf6f9517a7\\\nAny help is mucho appreciated, I think this is mostly a directory structure issue.\n\nA: I don't know if this will work or not, but you could try this: Firstly, delete all backups from iTunes. Quit iTunes. Then locate the iTunes backup folder /Backup and delete that. Then copy your backup to that location. Open iTunes and see if the backup is there again. If not, delete the backup location again. Make a new backup. Then replace the backup file from the one in your external drive.\nIf this doesn't work and no other suggestions work you might want to consider checking the apple forums/support website if someone has asked a similar question. If not, maybe ask there as well.\nYou could also try taking your iPhone and the back-up in to an Apple Store if you have AppleCare. Not sure if they would help you or not if you don't have AppleCare.\n", "Q: iPad can't be backed to iTunes 11 in Mountain Lion Since updating to iOS 6.1.3 I am no longer able to copy files onto iPad and can't back up to my main Mac Pro with Mountain Lion and iTunes 11.0.2.

Also no luck with using the seperate app GoodreaderUSB.\nAny ideas where to start with the troubleshooting?\n\nA: Try re-installing iTunes.  Sometimes the problem could stem from there. It's quick just head to the Apple website and download a copy and it will install on top of what you have.\nSilly but also try another USB port just to be safe.\n", "Q: Sync apps preferences between multiple Macs I tend to keep all my stuff in Dropbox. Now that I bought a second Mac, I thought that keeping also my applications preferences in Dropbox would have been a good idea.\nI managed to sync some of the Application Support folders (I just want the more important apps to be in sync) by simply linking the shared folder on Dropbox to the link on the Macs:\nln -s ~/Dropbox/SharedPrefs/AnApp ~/Library/Application Support/AnApp\n\nthis way I ensure that every, say, Sublime Text 2 build I create on one Mac will be synched on the other Mac.\nBut I'm having troubles in synching actual .plist files. I did the exact same thing as above (the example is for iTerm 2):\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ~/Dropbox/SharedPrefs/\nln -s ~/Dropbox/SharedPrefs/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist\n\nSo now I have the actual physical .plist file on Dropbox, and a placeholder link on the Mac.\nBut this doesn't seem to work: when I quit and re-open iTerm (or whatever application), it isn't able to use the symlink to access the preferences on Dropbox.\nWhat should I do?\nI'll appreciate every advice on how to keep application preferences synched between two Macs; I'm using the cmd-line just because I'm used to it but also a GUI utility is ok.\nAlso, an utility which doesn't sync only the Application Support folder, but also the .plists and other shared stuff would be great!\n\nA: Open preferences and check the box marked \"Load preferences from a customer folder or URL\"\" \nYou can browse to your Dropbox folder and the click \"Save Settings to Folder\"\n\n\nA: Confirming that Kevin's answer above also works via iCloud Drive sync in High Sierra.\nI did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder called \"Sync\" directly in iCloud Drive (as a sibling\nto Documents)\n\n*Create another folder called iTerm2 within Sync (presumably I will do this with other apps, hence the folder structure)\n\n*Point iTerm2 there via its Preferences. It will ask you if you want\nto place a current copy of the plist file there.\n\n*Repeat step #3 on all other systems where you want to use iTerm2\n\n\nNote that there can be some latency with iCloud Drive sync, but it does work.\n\nA: You could set up a folder action item that monitors the relevant folders and runs an Applescript that copies the relevant preference files to the Dropbox folder when the folder changes.\nAnother (similar) approach would be writing a launch agent:\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n <plist version=\"1.0\">\n <dict>\n     <key>Label</key>\n     <string>com.yourname.yourapp</string>\n     <key>Program</key>\n     <string>/Users/yourname/path/to/your/script</string>\n     <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n     <array>\n         <string>script</string>\n     </array>\n     <key>WatchPaths</key>\n     <array>\n         <string>/path/to/preferencefile1.plist</string>\n         <string>/path/to/preferencefile2.plist</string>\n     </array>\n </dict>\n </plist>\n\nSave this as a com.yourname.yourapp.plist file then copy it to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/. Load it in launchd using\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.yourapp.plist\n\nstart it:\n    launchctl start com.yourname.yourapp\nNow the launchd agent will run the script /Users/yourname/path/to/your/script every time  \"preferencefile1.plist\", \"preferencefile2.plist\", etc, are changed.\nFor example \"script\" could be something that copies the preference files to the dropbox folder.\nAnother launch agent should be set on the other machine to monitor the files in the dropbox folder and copy them to the correct location when they change.\n\nA: Another way, which would be useful for other kinds of files or other programs, is to use hard links instead of symbolic ones. Use \"ln\" instead of \"ln -s\". Beware - a hard link is very different than a symbolic. A sym link is just a pointer to the file. You can delete the link and the file is untouched. A hard link is a duplicate entry for the file in the disk's directory. It's as if the file were really in two places at once. A program can't tell any difference between the two. If you trash the link it deletes the actual file. These are so different that using the same name for both should probably not have been done.\n", "Q: What size should a background image be for Apple Configurator to place it on iOS devices? I'm looking to set up some custom backgrounds for iOS and using Apple Configurator to drag an image into the lock screen tab of the preferences and the tool crops the image for me.\nSo, considering that there are iPhone 4S and earlier screens, iPhone 5 screens as well as iPad screens - I'm a little confused as to how to prepare an image so I can understand what will be cropped for each screen, both horizontally and vertically.\nI can only see the portrait layout and it's not clear if the tool is showing me an iPhone 5 or iPhone 4 S sized crop (or any horizontal layouts).\nIs there a book, blog or help guide that explains what size image is best used for this lock screen customization so I can pre-plan the crop areas for each size screen? If not, has anyone done the work to know what areas are visible on the current iOS devices when you prepare them automatically with Apple Configurator?\n\nA: Your probably best of if you crop the photos yourself.

When I installed from BootCamp and partitioned I remember that BootCamp reserved 20GB space of OSX and wouldn't let me go beyond that.\nIs it possible to totally remove OSX and just have Arch running on this MBP? I don't mind reinstalling Arch again as everything I need on Arch is all backed up anyway.\n\nA: Piece of cake, boot the Mac in target mode, connect it to a computer and repartition / erase the drive.

Am I wrong? How could I get rid of this problem?\n\nA: Now that you are on Mountain Lion, you can boot to recovery mode and re-erase the entire Macintosh HD (or whatever name the OS volume has). Perhaps your definition of clean install didn't actually clean the offending apps or you are connecting another hard drives with apps purchases from the previous owner's account. (The app store will offer to update any apps it sees, not just the ones in /Applications)\n\nHere is a long article on recovery, but details at the bottom show explicit steps you would take to prepare an external drive to install Mountain Lion. You will want to perform those steps from Disk Utility when booted in recovery mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\nNote, that if the previous owner had \"redeemed\" the iLife apps (as described in the article above), those will remain tied to their account so for you to install them, you will need to purchase iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand since they are not part of the Mountain Lion software upgrade you purchased, but after a clean wipe, you won't have those applications and could only see them if you had a copy somewhere other than the wiped drive or signed in to see past purchases for that previous account.\n\nA: \nI thought that when I did a clean install, all of his information should have been deleted. Am I wrong? How could I get rid of this problem?\n\nYes and no. With a clean install you erased informations stored on hdd/ssd but when you finishes install and connect to internet your mac contact apple's servers and try to restore some info (if previous owners enabled backup on iCloud with same apple ID you are able to restore bookmarks, contact, etc).\nIn order to verify your identity Apple's servers get info from your mac (serial number) and match with last apple id registrated in they're database.\nThat's the reason you're prompted for previous owners apple id.\nYou can easily get rid of this by logging in with your Apple ID and data in Apple's db will be updated.\n\nA: May I give you some suggestion. you should bring your imac to one of the authorized replay center from apple .  and explain to then your situation . you should bring your buying document . let them  fix it for you . it 's will be a fee that you have to pay. \nI  also bought a imac  and it is happening to me too.  my case is quite bad . the previous owner intents to lock my imac  after you brought it home for few days . even i erase everything , before i start using it .  they lock in the EFI firmware and they look with passcode . you couldn't get in unless you pay them more money  . ....... \nMy case is  a very high price lesson . shouldn't buy a second hand imac or  any used apple products   \ntake my advice ..  the security in Mac is very secure      \n", "Q: Finder slow after wake up from standby mode I have 4 or 5 Network shares in my Favorites bar in the Finder.

My 08 mb, OSX Mt Lion, crashed so I bought new 2012 MBPr. Luckily, I backed everything up.  Migrated everything from 08mb over to new MBPr.  I noticed that when I deleted files, it skipped the trash can.  My home folder did not have me as admin with RW permissions so I had to add myself and give myself RW access.  \nBefore, when I opened iTerm (similar to Terminal), it would say computer name:~ username$.

Is there a package system (think npm, cpan, or even homebrew) that would be suitable for shell scripts?\n\nA: Shell scripts don't need much packaging, so most people use a source control system for this. There are dozens of options, but I'd start with github and come back with a more detailed question once the github / source control system broke under the strain of volume of your scripts or the complexity of the situation. \nAs it stands, we can only guess what your true requirements are since all three examples you list run natively on OS X and you can roll your own packages according to each recipe if you prefer to use them.\nFor internet hosting, you could easily use GitHub since they host files for download or you could push the files to Amazon S3 and many other cloud hosting services that serve up files for free or inexpensively. Amazon for example allows 5 GB of free space and 20,000 hits per month before you need to pay them anything. Dropbox also has no practical limit on the number of hits, but offers less space initially if you were to sign up for a new account with them.\n\nA: If you need traditional revision control, you can easily use GitHub even if you don’t know git via their free Mac app. I’ve done that at https://github.com/tjluoma?tab=repositories.\nIf you just want sharing, put your scripts on Dropbox. For example, I save mine in ~/Dropbox/bin/ which I’ve added to my $PATH so they’re available on all my Macs. View the file on Dropbox.com and choose the share option, then choose ‘Twitter’ to get the short URL like https://db.tt/oOYTUPB4 or the longer one like https://www.dropbox.com/s/8l906xc39uo2cbc/dock.sh\nThe advantage (or disadvantage, I suppose) of the Dropbox version is that it will always share the most recent version of the script without you having to do any sort of official check-in procedure.\nThe primary disadvantage of the Dropbox method is that the URL leads to a web page for the script, whereas the direct (or “raw”) version of the script can be located by adding ?dl=1 to the URL, such as https://www.dropbox.com/s/8l906xc39uo2cbc/dock.sh?dl=1\n", "Q: One-click automated USB trash delete Is there any way I can create an automator service or app to delete ALL trash from any USB drive (my own account's trash plus everybody else's)?\nI've read several solutions involving Terminal, including this one, but I'd like something a bit more foolproof and really handy.\nI need to exchange USB drives regularly for presentations at events and Mac trash is becoming a problem as Macs become more common -- people suddenly get \"no space available\" error messages and can't do anything about it. I know how to skip the trash, but need a quick fix when the trash is already there.\n\nA: 2 Solutions. 1 using Bash the other using Bash wrapped in AppleScript.\nSolution #1\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new AppleScript with /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor\n\n*Type the following code:\ndo shell script \"rm -rf /Volumes/*/.Trashes/*\" with administrator privileges\n\n\n*Save the file to somewhere convenient and run it whenever you need to clear the USB Trash\n\n*This can be executed by double-clicking on it\n\n\nNOTE: This will empty the Trash for all connected volumes including your internal hard disk.

How it can be possible?\nI'm using Mountain Lion with GIMP 2.\nAppreciate any help, thanks.\n\nA: If I understand this bug report (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689657) correctly, you can check if your version of Gimp supports ps and eps (it may not, even if you have ghostscript) by doing the following:\nOpen Gimp.\nIn the menu, click help, and then procedure browser.\nIn the procedure browser search for 'file-ps-load'. If it's not listed, Gimp won't open ps or eps files.\nMy version of Gimp doesn't have this. But I haven't tried downloading the current version, maybe the current version has this enabled.\nIt's not too hard these days to set up Linux in VirtualBox. If you have no other alternatives available and don't want to buy Windows or another computer, you can use Gimp on Linux (probably Ubuntu) in VirtualBox.\n\nA: I have no explanation but you can use Partha.com's distribution to open .eps (download link to be added when more reputation) instead of the general distribution.\nSource: ofnuts'answer on gimpforum.com. Working in OS X 10.11.\nEdit: to make it stand alone\n\nA: Gimp normally \"opens\" an EPS file by rasterizing it first, normally through GhostScript. If you don't have ghost script installed, this may be failing or there might not be an eps plugin installed on your copy of the Mac OS X version of Gimp.\nOnce you have GhostScript installed, you just need to make sure that Gimp can see the 'gs' binary so that it can rasterize the EPS files.\n", "Q: Python launching problems OS X I'm trying to install python on mac OS X 10.7.5. I installed it from MacPort and I think before I did, I screwed up $PATH somehow. It seems to install fine but then when I try to run ipython I get \n-bash: ipython: command not found.\n\nI thought it had something to do with the path and when I do /bin/echo $PATH I get something that seems really weird to me: \nopt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin\n\n\nA: You need to install ipython in addition to python:\n$ port search ipython\n\npy-ipython @0.13.2 (python)\nAn enhanced Interactive Python shell\n\nWith\n$ sudo port select --set ipython ipython24\n\nyou can then select the version you want.\nIt ill be installed in\n$ type ipython\nipython is /opt/local/bin/ipython\n\nCheck that your PATH begins with /opt/local/bin and not with opt/local/bin/ (notice the beginning /)\n", "Q: How can I take custom printer settings from one computer and transfer them to others on the network?

Let me give a few details about my experience: \nI suddenly had issues connecting to the internet (I was able to connect to the wifi, but could not load a webpage in less than 2-3 minutes if/when it loaded) at my home, but had no issues when connecting directly to my modem via an ethernet cable - thus, it was not a network card issue or an issue with my internet provider. \nAfter that, I had suddenly begun having issues connecting to the networks at my office and school...which is when I began to get frustrated. \nSee my answer below for how I resolved this issue. \n\nA: After having issues with my home, office, and school networks (i.e. all networks I tried connecting to), I realized that the only thing these networks all had in common (besides my computer) was that they were all secured networks. \nWhen I tried connecting to an open network, I had no issues at all - thus my realization that some settings on my MBA got screwed up somehow, and the security authorization was screwing things up. \nResolution: To do a hard reset on your WIFI settings, go into Macintosh HD -> Library -> Preferences (see screenshot below). Remove the SystemConfiguration  folder (place it on your Desktop for now). Reboot your MBA.\nAt this point, I had no issues connecting to any WIFI networks - I hope you have the same result.\n\n\nA: Instead of removing the whole SystemConfiguration folder, just do the following:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Turn your Wi-Fi off\n  \n*Open Finder window\n  \n*Press Command+Shift+G\n  \n*Enter \"/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/\" and hit enter\n  \n*Delete the following files (\n  com.apple.airport.preferences.plist,\n  com.apple.network.identification.plist,\n  NetworkInterfaces.plist,\n  preferences.plist)\n  \n*Empty the trash\n  \n*Reboot your Mac\n  \n*Turn Wi-Fi back on again\n  \n\n", "Q: restore Mac OS Mountain Lion to factory settings without discs or time machine backups I installed XCode 3 on Mac OS Mountain Lion 10.8 and now I am getting the Apple BSODs.\nCan I do a system restore without having the discs as I seem to have nothing to use, also I have no Time Machine backups setup.\nI cannot get into the machine (as it gets stuck in a infinite boot loop) unless I hold SHIFT and go into Safe Mode. Cmd + R doesn't work, so I can't get into recovery mode.\nThankfully I have little to no data on the disk that I want to keep, so i'd happily return to factory settings - but I don't know how, or even if this is possible.\nHere is the screen I am getting on my iMac:\n\n\nA: OK,\nReading you question lets clarify few things first.\nYou say Control-R! but it has to be the Command-R.\nThen you say you can get in to the Safe mode!. If so:\nWith your Mac running in Safe Mode, you can troubleshoot the issue you were having, such as by deleting an application that's causing problems, removing a startup or login item that's causing issues, or launching Disk First Aid and repairing permissions.\nIf you get in the CMD-R mode use the option 4 first to see if it can be repaired.\n\nIf your Mac problem is a little less common — your hard drive has failed or you’ve installed a hard drive without OS X, for example — Internet Recovery takes over automatically.\n\n", "Q: Cannot remove DevonThink Pro from menu bar I installed DEVONthink Pro, then uninstalled by removing the App from the Applications dir, but I can not get rid of the icon/menu in the menu bar.\n\nI've removed every file anywhere that has the name 'devon', but the think just will not go.\n\nA: The menu you are seeing is actually the AppleScript system menu.

For a iPhone 3GS with a IOS version 4.1(with cydia) is it possible to upgrate to 6.1.3(or something above 5) and unlock.\niTunes gives update for 6.1.3 . While evad3rs have unclocked till version 6.1.2 . \nHow can such an upgrade be possible. I know that first of all I have to upgrade through iTunes. But will I be available to unlock after that?\n\nA: I have 3Gs with New Bootrom but manufactured before 2011. I had accidently updated iPhone from iTunes to 6.1.3. That upgraded my baseband to 05.16.08 and left me with a locked phone.\nThis is what I did.  You can do the same even if you have old Bootrom (that is in fact a boon since you’ll get untethered jailbreak of 6.1.3). But if your phone in manufactured in 2011 (exact date please Google it), then DONOT ATTEMPT THIS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Thumb Rule: Make sure your internet connectivity is present throughout. Make sure of the versions of software mentioned. Make Sure you have shsh blobs of 6.1.3 present (in case you want to go to 6.1.3 in step6). Run all tools as “run as administrator” on windows.\n\n*Download iOS 4.1. Download Latest TinyUmbrella. Download latest iREB. Put your iPhone in Pwned DFU mode via iREB (Dark screen with no logo). Start TinyUmbrella TSS Server and use iTunes 11 to flash stock 4.1 onto iPhone (hold shift key while selecting restore from iTunes and select 4.1 iOS). Now your Phone is on iOS 4.1 and Baseband 05.16.08, since baseband cannot downgrade via iTunes.\n\n*Jailbreak using Redsn0w V0.9.14 b2– Select option Install Cydia and Install iPad Baseband. Now your Phone is on iOS 4.1 and Baseband 6.15.00. (May require couple of retries. If putting DFU mode from Cydia doesn’t work, try putting it in DFU mode through iREB)\n\n*Once Jailbroken, run Redsn0w0.9.15b1 – select ios4.1 from extras and deselect Install Cydia and select downgrade from iPad baseband. Now your Phone is on iOS 4.1 and Baseband 5.13.04. (May require couple of retries. If putting DFU mode from Cydia doesn’t work, try putting it in DFU mode through iREB)\n\n*Now you have a working iPhone 3gs on iOS 4.1 untethered and you can unlock it from Ultrasn0w. Proceed below only if you are willing to risk a tethered jailbreak for 6.1.3 \n\n*Download iOS 6.0.0 and 6.1.3 for 3gs. Download sn0wbreeze v2.9.14. \n\n*Start TinyUmbrella TSS server. Prepare Custom ipsw through Sn0wbreeze with option iFaith. When it asks for 6.1.3 appticket, pass on shsh blobs for 6.1.3 (This mode will preserve baseband too, so don’t worry). Sn0wbreeze will prepare the ROM (takes some time). At the end of it, it asks you to put your phone in DFU. Don’t use that. Close the Sn0wbreeze and use latest iREB to put phone in Pwned DFU mode.\n\n*Start iTunes. Use shift restore and select ipsw built by Sn0wbreeze. When restore is complete and it reboots, press home+power key to force shutdown and reboot using the iBooty tool created by Sn0wbreeze in Step 7 which is now placed on your desktop.\n\n*Now run Redsn0w0.9.15b1, select ipsw in extra as 6.0.0 (not 6.1.3!!). Click on jailbreak and install Cydia option. (May require couple of retries. If putting DFU mode from Cydia doesn’t work, try putting it in DFU mode through iREB). Whenever the phone is booted, don’t boot from Redsn0w’s ‘just boot’ option. Always use iBooty. If it starts booting in between, force shutdown from home+power and start with iBooty.\n\n*Now you should have a 3Gs on iOS 6.1.3, which is Jailbroken (tethered in case of New Bootrom) and fully unlockable through Ultras0W at baseband 5.13.04. You’ll have to use iBooty every time you iPhone restarts.\n\n", "Q: How to get particular folders from time machine backup? I'm going to perform a clean install of OS X. I have a Time Machine backup. \nI want to restore just particular folders, not everything. Is that possible?\n\nA: According to the Apple documentation about using TimeMachine and Migration Assistant you can select all, several or no User accounts to transfer; select all or no applications; select computer settings and sub-settings or none at all; and finally, other files and folders not explicitly chosen from above.\nAdditionally, under the User account migration you can chose to migrate\na subset of the Users' account folders, namely any mix of the folders Desktop, Document, Downloads, Movies, Music, Pictures, Public (if it exists), Sites (if it exists) and other files that may reside in the Users's account but not in the Apple default folders mentioned above.\nFurthermore, there are arguments for and against migrating the contents of the Applications folder. Some power-users with full sets of installation CDs and DVDs, with all the documentation and serial numbers for the software they own, say it is best not to migrate the Applications folder and instead reinstall all non-Apple software titles from scratch, and to download new copies of other software. While this scheme may be time-consuming and cumbersome, it does guarantee fresh installs. Given the utility of Apple's App store being able to download up-to-date versions of software you have purchased through the store, this may not be as difficult as it seems. On the other hand, if you have a slew of software titles for which you no longer have the distribution media, or for software which is no longer available, migrating the whole Applications folder is your best bet.\nLastly, you can access the TimeMachine disk itself and copy over files & folders manually.\n", "Q: Can I make a custom keyboard shortcut available to all users? I've created a keyboard shortcut but it only works for my current user, we have 3 users on our Mac (OS X 10.8.3) but if I set up a short cut, I have to then set the same one up for our other 2 users.\nIs there a way to make it universal?\n\nA: Typically when you adjust a Keyboard Shortcut, the file(s) that are actually effected are in ~/Library/Preferences/ . If you take those same files to /Library (Not the User Library) they should be accessible to All Users. \nExamples might be \ncom.apple.systempreferences.plist\ncom.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n", "Q: Image files made with Disk Utility creates parent folder I'm using OS X 10.5.8., updated from 10.5.2. which I installed from the two installation DVDs that came with my MB404 MacBook.\nI recently found my original 10.5.2. installation DVDs, which I thought I had lost. So I want to save them as image files on my backup drive in .iso format (since I normally use Windows).\nI created .iso files from the DVDs in Disk Utility (> New Image > Image Format DVD/CD master > Save, then later renamed the .cdr file to .iso).\nWhen I create an image from my DVD \"Mac OS X Install Disc 1\", it (as expected) creates an image called \"Mac OS X Install Disc 1.iso\":\n\nBut when I inspect this .iso file with 7zip later, I notice that the image file contains a parent folder with the same name as the image file, i.e. a folder \"Mac OS X Install Disc 1\":\n\nInside this folder there are a range of folders and files pertaining to the installation of Mac OS:\n\nThis is not what I expected to find. I expected to see what you see in the third picture here directly when I looked inside the .iso file. But for all I know, that is how .dmg image files are and are supposed to be.\nThe reason I am asking is this: If I burn this .iso image file to a DVD, will it be bootable on a Mac computer?\nEDIT:\nI tried what Gordon suggested. It seems counterintuitive to me to burn an image of the DVD drive and not the DVD disc, but I gave it a try.\nMy resulting .cdr file now looks somewhat different from the .iso file discussed above - at first sight.\nThe file is now a MacOSX1052Disc1.cdr file:\n\nIts content is different from the .iso file. The content looks like this:\n\nI see that there is an Mac_OS_X.hfs file here. HFS is basically an Apple image format. Opening this file reveals the identical content of the .iso file discussed above:\n\n\nIn other words, my initial concern with the .iso file was that the content seemed to be inside the parent folder rather than at the top of the file hierarchy. Using Gordon's suggested approach, however, the content in question is buried even further down the hierarchy. I doubt, therefore, that this is the right approach to take here.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure you created the image wrong. When you create the image in Disk Utility, it's very important that you specify the source correctly. I'm not certain I remember exactly right, so you should test this before you trust the results, but here's the process as I remember it:\n\n*\n\n*In Disk Utility's sidebar, select the DVD's entry. IIRC, it'll actually list two entries in the sidebar: the DVD itself, and then indented under that the installer volume (\"Mac OS X Install DVD\" or something like that. You want the DVD entry, not the volume entry under it.\nIIRC older versions of Disk Utility would actually list three entries: the DVD, a session under that, and the volume under that. In this case, I'm pretty sure it's the session (the middle entry) you want.\n\n\n*Under the File menu, choose \"New\" > \"Image from disk2\" (or whatever the disk ID is). This tells Disk Utility you want a raw device image, not just image the files contained in the disk.\n\n\n*In the save dialog, set the Image Format to \"DVD/CD master\"\nI think that procedure will work, but to be sure it's best to rename the file from \".cdr\" to \".iso\", copy it to your Windows computer, burn it to a DVD-R, and actually try booting the Mac from it. Note that if you mount the .iso on Windows you will not see anything like what you expect -- IIRC the 10.5 install DVDs are actually in a hybrid format that contains a Windows-readable driver disk for Boot Camp, and a Mac-readable (& bootable) installer volume. So if you mount it on Windows, you'll see Windows drivers, not a Mac installer. (BTW, this is also true of the original DVD, so try mounting that on your Windows computer to check my memory.)\n"]
