["Q: QML: How to do variables? In QML, I am just looking for a way to do fairly simple variables:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bool\n\n*String\n\n*Integer\n\n\nA: You can use QML basic types or the generic var property.\n\nThe var type is a generic property type that can refer to any data\n  type.\nIt is equivalent to a regular JavaScript variable. For example, var\n  properties can store numbers, strings, objects, arrays and functions.\n\nThe following code will demonstrate the use of both basic types and var properties:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nRectangle {\n    id: mainView\n    width: units.gu(30) \n    height: units.gu(40)\n\n    Item {\n        id: myItem\n        property int aNumber: 100\n        property bool aBool: false\n        property string aString: \"Hello world!\"\n        property var aVarNumber: 100\n        property var aVarBool: false\n        property var aVarString: \"Hello world!\"\n    }\n\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        console.log(myItem.aNumber, myItem.aVarNumber)\n        console.log(myItem.aBool, myItem.aVarBool)\n        console.log(myItem.aString, myItem.aVarString)\n    }\n}\n\nSource: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtqml-typesystem-basictypes.html \n", "Q: Reliance. netconnect on kubuntu I recently installed kubuntu. 14.04 and. I am not able to use Reliance. netconnect. on it. pls.help how to connect. to internet. using Reliance. netconnect. on kubuntu. 14.04\n\nA: Go to network connections. In that select mobile broadband tab.Follow the instructions and create one wireless network connection by selecting you connection as reliance in the drop down list. Once finished enter your reliance netconnect username and password which is usually the device number and try to connect. If not connected try to change some authentication settings like CHAP,PAP etc. It will work.No need to install the reliance netconnect+ setup in linux. It will work directly.\n\nA: 1) Install wvdial package using apt-get\nOpen terminal, and type the following command\nsudo apt-get install wvdial\n\n2) Install gnome-ppp using apt-get\nsudo apt-get install gnome-ppp\n\n3) Open gnome-ppp from the terminal. Better to use sudo mode as you need to configure wvdial.\nsudo gnome-ppp\n\n4) You would see the gnome-ppp interface like below. You have to enter your reliance 10-digit mobile number in the Username & your password. Select #777 if you are a Reliance Netconnect Broadband+ user. put your 10 digit username *********, put your Password ********\" Then press the Setup button below.\n5) Press your Detect button on setup OR select your device from select option for example  /usb/ttyUSB0 and then close setup window and press connect. Now you will get a \"connected\" window prompt.     $#@&%\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 (amd64) not detecting all of my memory I've got 4gb of RAM installed in my machine but Ubuntu only detects 2.8gb of RAM\nIf I run uname -a I get:\n\nLinux DeLillo 3.13.0-24-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 10 19:11:08 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nWhich seems to confirm that I'm running Ubuntu in 64-bit.\nI also have an nVidia graphics card installed that may have memory allocated to it.

It also claims my cached memory is 2814mb with 332kb reserved.\nEverything else (FSB, memory speed, caches, etc.) seem to be reported correctly. BIOS correctly reports that I have 4096mb installed. I now suspect this is a hardware issue.\n\nA: Execute\nsudo lshw -class memory\n\nin terminal.\nOutput gives detailled info about RAM installed.\nIf it is less than 4GB run memtest86+ from GRUB.\n\nA: In my case it turns out that there is a problem with the ICS clock in my motherboards firmware that can result in memory resources being incorrectly allocated. The latest firmware release supposedly fixes this problem but I rarely use this machine and I'm not confident in how to flash my BIOS in Ubuntu so I think I'm just going to leave it.\n", "Q: Can I install Intel graphics installer for one version on the next version?

I am (or maybe I should use was) thinking of learning to develop/code with Qt but haven't managed to get past creating a new project structure!\nPlease guide me through this.\n\nA: Version Control System (VCS), Revision Control or Source Control are software systems used to track changes in files, usually used in software development.\nHow it works \nUsually the files are hosted in a repository (a directory tree for each project). A developer A writes a software system and uses VCS to track the file changes. A developer B wants to add a new feature to the software system or fix a found bug. A common development process goes like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Developer B will want to get the sources in order to work on them\n\n*Developer B works on new features on his copy of the repository\n\n*Developer B commits his work locally\n\n*Developer B completes his job and commits the changes back to the remote (original) repository\n\n\nNote this is one way of doing things, there can be various ways such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Working a one man project (solo) and keeping the repositories locally.\n\n*Working in a group project with a central remote repository\n\n*Various other flavors\n\n\nFor Bazaar you can check the documentation here and decide what works for you.\nDo I Have Bazzar in my System?\nYou can check if Bazaar is installed in your system by issuing the following in terminal which bzr, if Bazaar is installed you will get: /usr/bin/bzr else you will have to install it with sudo apt-get install bzr\nPotential Suspect\nFrom the screenshots you provided it seems that you do not have QT development framework installed in your system (qmake is absent). You can get the Qt framework from the official site or through the Software Center (search for qt-sdk), it will yield the following:\n\nor sudo apt-get install qt-sdk, additionally you can install the documentation.\n\nA: First make sure that you have build-essential properly installed:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nThen in Tools -> Options -> Tool Chains just add GCC and set your gcc path as the compiler path.\nUPDATE:\nThis my SDK setup on precise:\n\nI seems that you need to specify qmake-qt4 instead of just qmake.\n", "Q: Xubuntu VMware Player missing vmrun utility I have Xubuntu 14.04 and I have installed VMware Player from the official website.

I am trying to setup LVM for my netbook's two, small SSDs (4 & 8GB).  After a lot of trial and error, I followed this walk-through: How to Set Up Multiple Hard Drives As One Volume.  I have completed the steps for my 4GB volume (/dev/sda) and successfully set up a VG (\"vgsystem\") and LV (\"lvfacade\").  However, when repeating the steps for the 8GB volume (/dev/sdb1), I was unable to extend \"vgsystem\" to include /dev/sdb1 because I had added it to a VG (\"vgsystem2\") earlier.  How can I remove \"vgsystem2\" and add /dev/sdb1 to \"vgsystem\"?\nI appreciate the help.\n\nA: vgremove vgsystem2\nvgextend vgsystem /dev/sdb1\nI am assuming that /dev/sba1 on the last line actually means /dev/sdb1\nEdit 1\nYou don't need to run partprobe after the reboot. But it wouldn't hurt.\npvscan tells you that you have 2 lvm2 devices (/dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1). In addition to that sda1 is fully used for volume group vgsystem. \nNot surprisingly pvcreate fails because /dev/sda1 is already a physical volume.\nNot surprisingly vgcreate fails because vgsystem already exists.\n/dev/sda1 looks a bit small. Do you have /dev/sda2 or perhaps unpartitioned space on /dev/sda?\nI am not sure what you are trying to achieve\nIf you want to remove VG vgsystem from /dev/sda1 use pvremove vgsystem\nIf you want your 2 devices to be treated as a single logical volume you need to expand volume group vgsystem to sdb1 and then create a logical volume:\nvgextend vgsystem /dev/sdb1\nlvcreate -l 100%VG -n lvsystem vgsystem\nthen you should be able to make a filesystem on /dev/lvsystem, mount it and use it.\nEdit 2\nUmm, I haven't forsaken you.

When with Saucy, I used this tutorial to have gtk3 indicators in xfce4-panel:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Specifications/Saucy/Gtk3Indicators\nNow I upgraded to Trusty and I see a messed up panel, so I'd like to revert to the original indicators. How can I do?\n\nA: When you followed the steps to install development versions of xfce-panel and the indicator plugin, you built them from source, and sudo make install installed them into /usr/local.\nIn order to clean out that installation you need to manually delete those installed files. Unfortunately there is no way to do this automatically. However, what you can do is follow the installation steps again and observe what files it installs and then delete them by hand. You can semi-automate this by doing:\nfind /usr/local/ -mtime -1 -type f\n\nThis will list all files in /usr/local less than 1 day old, which should include all the installed files if you follow the installation steps again. You can also use -delete argument with find to delete all the found files, but check first that the result is sane.\nEdit: Apparently, sudo make uninstall may work for this particular set of applications. If you still have the repositories where you built the software just run sudo make uninstall in each one. If not, you will need to go through the install steps again, skipping the sudo make install for each repository, and then running sudo make uninstall in all three at the end, after you have built everything.\n", "Q: gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file -> problem in extracting jdk-7u55-linux-x64.tar.gz I have downloaded 'jdk-7u55-linux-x64.tar.gz' \nWhen I execute following command to extract,\n sudo tar xvzf jdk-7u55-linux-x64.tar.gz\n\nalso tried,\nsudo tar xvf jdk-7u55-linux-x64.tar.gz\nsudo tar xf jdk-7u55-linux-x64.tar.gz\nsudo tar -xvf jdk-7u55-linux-x64.tar.gz\n\nBut am getting error at last as,\ngzip: stdin: unexpected end of file\ntar: Unexpected EOF in archive\ntar: Unexpected EOF in archive\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n\nHow to resolve this ?\n\nA: Please don't use sudo unless necessary.

Now in my dropbox folder I have created a new directory named Documents. Now is there any way such that this two could be same? i.e if I update any of this, both of them will be updated. I think it may be done by symlink, but the idea of symlinks is not clear to me about what it does. \n\nA: Just use symlinks:\nln -s ~/Documents ~/Dropbox/\n\nThat will create a directory in your $HOME/Dropbox that is actually a link to ~/Documents. This means that any changes you make to ~/Documents will also be visible in ~/Dropbox/Documents since the latter is just a link to the former.\nSymlinks are simple tricks. You can think of the symlink as a virtual copy of the link's target. Any operations done on the link are actually applied to the target. The two are exact copies of each other. Deleting the link will not affect the target in any way. To illustrate, here's a simple example:\n$ mkdir foo\n$ touch foo/file1\n$ tree\n.\n└── foo\n    └── file1\n\n1 directory, 1 file\n\nSo, we have a directory called foo that contains a file called file. Now, what happens if we create a link to foo?\n$ ln -s foo bar\n$ tree\n.\n├── bar -> foo\n└── foo\n    └── file1\n\n2 directories, 1 file\n\nOK, let's see the contents of bar:\n$ ls bar\nfile1\n\nWhat if we delete the file?\n$ rm foo/file1\n$ ls bar\n$\n\nThe bar directory is now empty because it is just a symlink to foo so deleting foo/file1 also deleted bar/file1 because the two were the same file.\nConversely, deleting the link itself will not affect the original in any way because the link is just that, a link.\n\nA: Similar question: check this \nAutomatically mirror a directory in Ubuntu\nWhat you are trying to do is what RAID and other stuffs do, it would be great if you read about them maybe it will give you a better solution.

The route table of the computer is shown in this screen capture:\nMy question is that, how I could change the sequence of the gateways with the network-manager in ubuntu, so that the gateway of wlan0 will be used before the eth4's. Otherwise when I unplug the cable from eth5, I will lose connection to the network (the gateway of eth4 will be used by default).  \nI tried editing the /etc/network/interfaces file, but it conflicts with the network-manager, and it can not handle the dynamic events (e.g., when network cable is plugged or unplugged), meaning that its settings are static, while the network-manager can handle these things perfectly, and change the network configurations adaptively, so I would like to find a solution for this problem with network-manager. \nThe os is ubuntu 13.04 32bit.

Currently my program installs to /usr/bin or whatever and I need to change it to /opt/appname. Where do I specify that in the debian source package?\nRasmus\n\nA: If there are files that need to be installed into your package but your standard make install won't do it, put the filenames and destinations into an install file. They are installed by dh_install.You should first check there is not a more specific tool to use. For example, documents should be in the docs file and not in this one.\nThis install file has one line per file installed, with the name of the file (relative to the top build directory) then a space then the installation directory (relative to the install directory). One example of where this is used is if a binary src/bar is left uninstalled; the install file might look like:\nsrc/bar usr/bin\n\nThis means when this package is installed, there will be an executable command /usr/bin/bar.\nAlternatively, this install can have the name of the file only without the installation directory when the relative directory path does not change. This format is usually used for a large package that splits the output of its build into multiple binary packages using package-1.install, package-2.install, etc. \nSo the only thing you need to do is to create a file named debian/my_package.install (replace my_package with the actual name of your package) with the following line:\npath/to/your/program /opt/appname\n\nSource\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Brightness issue with nvidia Quadro I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 13.10 to 14.04.

Therefore, I reinstalled 14.04 cleanly, yet this problem still persists \n\nA: It's probably a bug with drivers > 304 which has been around for a while:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10 kernel 3.11.0-12.19-generic 3.11.3 -> suggested workarounds: using nvidia drivers 304\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10 kernel 3.11.0-15.25-generic 3.11.10 -> suggested workarounds: using nvidia drivers 304\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 kernel 3.13.0-24.47-generic 3.13.9 -> suggested workarounds: none\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 kernel 3.13.0-32.57-generic 3.13.11.4 -> suggested workarounds: none\nAccording to these bug reports the only solution is to roll back to a driver version <= 304.\n\nA: Not a solution but rather a workaround.\nThere should be a file\n/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\nIn this file you have a particular decimal value which corresponds to brightness. \nNow, when I use openbox  desktop environment, my fn key doesn't work, which is why i use the following script to set it:\n#!/bin/mksh\nprintf \" \\n Entering file to change brightness in 3 seconds\\n remember - no new line after number.  \";\nsleep 3;\nsudo nano /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nNow, you may want to check the /sys/class/backlight folder just to make sure that you have acpi_video0 file there. It may be named differently for your system\nI will link a relevant askubuntu question if you're interested in varioius workarounds for setting brightness\nUpdate\nI've wrote another script which uses zenity (graphical front end for scripts) and xrandr, with a desktop shortcut.\nTools you need\n\n\n*\n\n*xrandr (should be installed by default, don't quote me on that) and knowing the name of your display \n\n*zenity (should be installed by default, don't quote me on that)\n\n*desktop shortcut backlight.desktop\n\n\nDesktop shortcut\nCreate backlight.desktop file on your desktop and make it executable with sudo chmod a+x ~/Desktop/backlight.desktop.

If you go bellow 0.2 or 1 screen gets either too dark or too bright. In this script, the user double-clicks on the backlight.desktop shortcut, which calls graphical pop-up with a scale, where user selects necessary brightness from 0 to 7. That value is incremented by 2 ( so max is 7+2=9 and min is 0+2=2 ) and stored in brightness variable. That variable then becomes the value after decimal point for xrandr --output LVDS --brightness 0.$brightness.\nThe if - then  block is used to test whether the user actually selected something. Without it, xrandr will set brightness to 0, in which case you won't see anything on your screen, even tty1, and will have to either reboot or do Alt+SYSRQ+R+E+I+S+U+B\nNote, that xrandr is a software solution, not hardware solution, i.e. you're not changing brightness of screen directly.\nHow it should look\n\nNote on xrandr\nRun xrandr without any arguments to determine your primary connected display\nMy example\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192\nVGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nLVDS connected primary 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 193mm\n   1366x768       60.0*+\n   1280x720       59.9  \n   1152x768       59.8  \n   1024x768       59.9  \n   800x600        59.9  \n   848x480        59.7  \n   720x480        59.7  \n   640x480        59.4  \n\nSources\n\n\n*\n\n*Brightness changing through command line\n\n*Making script shortcut\n\n*Zenity scale\n\nA: I got it to work on a Lenovo W510 with a Quadro FX 880M by creating /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf with the following contents:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier    \"Device0\"\n    Driver        \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName    \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName     \"Quadro FX 880M\"\n    Option        \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\nEndSection\n\nAfter reboot my brightness controls work correctly.\n\nA: At last it is fixed with latest driver which was released by Nvidia with release date: 2017.5.4 and its version number:  375.66\nRelease notes including following explanation:\nFixed a bug that caused backlight brightness to not be controllable on some notebooks with DisplayPort internal panels.\n", "Q: Epson Stylus TX110 ink levels I'm running Lubuntu 14.4 on my Acer Travelmate 2490.

I have never worked with anything but Windows systems. So I'm basically a total greenie A CD is just under 700 MB. I used the InfraRecorder and got the download on the disc, ran it and it was nothing but an error on every file. I tried a DVD made on a Windows 7 machine. Nothing.It won't recognize the DVD as a boot medium\nI'm ready to trash it all, but no one wants to make a new computer for you without an OS. I refuse to sucumb to Win8. I've read enough to know that it's a modified version of the Vista junk from years back.\nIs there a way to buy an installation CD from anywhere? Can I wipe my hard drive clean and start over? I have all of my programs saved to a 8 GB stick. It's either this or I erase everything on the computer but the OS and use it only for Internet access. 90% of what I do is Internet only.\n\nA: On such an old PC i would prefer Lubuntu.\nlubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso 683M  Desktop image for PC (Intel x86) computers (standard download)\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/14.04/release/\nThis fits also on a CD -> 683MB\nHere is a good installation guide.\n\nA: You can't use DVDs on the machine but you can use CDs.\nThe minimal installer is under 30mb. Download it from here.\n\nA: Configure boot priority in BIOS\nWhen I first migrated to Ubuntu, my BIOS had to be configured to recognize the CD/DVD drive as a bootable source.  This would be my very first step.  Your BIOS menu should also tell you if your drive is DVD compatible (if you don't already know).\nThe process consisted of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter BIOS setup by pressing F2 before the OS loads on boot\n\n*Make CD drive bootable\n\n*Change boot order preference so that CD would boot before the hard drive\n\n*Save changes and exit (which restarts the machine)\n\n\nMy old machine was not capable of booting from USB or network.\nThen as the other contributors have suggested, try using a slim install or Lubuntu.  But make sure you're connected by Ethernet cable (if possible) for downloads during install.\n\nA: Your Dell tower may not have a dvd drive which is why it won't read the dvd and installation images have gotten too large to fit on a CD these days.  You could go with the minimal installer as suggested by another poster or you could write the image to a flash drive.  See directions here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nAlso, you can buy installation media here:\nhttp://shop.canonical.com/index.php?cPath=17\nbut only do that if you're sure you have a dvd drive.  Also be sure to check system requirements to make sure that your computer will run Ubuntu reasonably.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements\n\nA: Before you do anything, check you're using the right version of Ubuntu. The two main downloads are 32bit and 64bit. Given the age of your computer it seems likely (though not guaranteed) that you might be limited to 32bit. If you have downloaded a 64bit version, and are running it on a 32bit machine, that might give you the behaviour you've seen.\nAnd I would contend that there are lots of companies that sell computers without operating systems. They might just not be local to you.

I use Chrome browser in XP to prepare Powerpoint presentations in Office 2007 for University. LibreOffice is less than satisfactory at my University. Am I safe surfing Net in Chrome on XP in VirtualBox under Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: No. It's a real install of Windows XP. That isn't safe. \nConsider that if you also share things between it and the host, the host isn't safe either. Mapping a network drive in? That isn't safe now and anything that trusts that also now isn't safe.\nEven if your browser itself is kept up to date, the software it uses plugins, system libraries, the network stack, etc... They're all slowly becoming abandoned by their developers. That means eventually any exposure to the wild will eventually become hazardous.\nI would strongly recommend only using XP in an offline-only setting, if at all. I don't understand why you can't just use Chrome in the host. And there are more options for editing Powerpoint slides than just {Libre,Open}Office and full install of Microsoft Office:\n\n\n*\n\n*Web: Powerpoint Online\n\n*Web: Google Docs\n\n*App: Calligra Stage\nThere are options out there... Many better than Powerpoint-proper. Most free to some degree.\n\nA: Windows XP has reached End-of-Line and there are already security vulnerabilities surfacing which won't be fixed for Windows XP. So, using XP with internet access wouldn't be secure at all.\nSince the only need for running Windows in Virtualbox is Office 2007, you can install Office 2007 in Ubuntu using Wine and PlayOnLinux. Follow the following question on how to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Wine support Office 2007?\nAnd Chrome is already available on Ubuntu. But I am not really sure how you use it \"in XP to prepare Powerpoint presentations in Office 2007\" :-)\n\nA: I have XP-specific applications that won't run under wine or any later windows, as well as some windows-only applications, so for me an XP VM is an absolute requirement, which I've given some thought to.\nYou are at risk, but you can bring the risk down to an acceptable level by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not browsing in the VM - do that in the host, copy files across as required.\n\n*If there's some bizarre reason why you really must browse in the guest, throw all the browser-based security you can at it (strict noscript etc.) and only for the sites you really have to (and see item 4.).\n\n*Cutting out all non-essential services from XP (especially network-related ones, but note that networking is used to share folders to the host.\n\n*Running your VM from a file system that appears to be called immutable in the docs - it's reset to the starting conditions on shutdown.  I asked about this here.\n\n*or running still-supported security software on the guest (it's no use if you can't keep it up-to-date, which you can't if loads from immutable storage).\n\n*Firewalling the VM on the host (which I haven't done properly yet, so can't go into more detail, but basically close all the ports to start with).\n\n", "Q: Multi Monitor Issues after fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 I just performed a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04. I have 3 Nvidia Quadro Cards powering three monitors. I used nvidia-settings to enable the three monitors:\n*NOTE: The forum will not let me post the image until I have at least \"10 reputation\". I don't think the image is necessary for understanding, it just shows that all three monitors are enabled in the Nvidia Settings Window. If you need it, I can PM it to you.\nAfter rebooting all three monitors are being used, but only the primary monitor has a desktop. I can move the mouse to the other two monitors just fine, but the mouse pointer turns into an 'X', and I am unable to drag windows to them. When I try to drag a window onto the other monitor, the desktop acts as if they are not there and tries to dock the window on that side of my primary monitor (desktop).

I think Xinerama is what I need to use, with this computer, I had it configured correctly on Ubuntu 12.04 without any issues, but an update to unity broke everything; so I upgraded to 14.04. Until I can replace X11 with MIR or Wayland, I would like to get Xinerama to work with my current version of Unity, which is 7.2.0.\nWhen I enable Xinerama in my xorg.conf, I am able to log in and can see the background on all three screens, but unity fails to load; something fails with compiz. If I reboot unity, I am able to get the desktop to load and open GUI applications, but I cannot drag them to other monitors. If I try, they are not rendered on the other screens, although I am still able to interact with them and drag them back (only by remembering where the mouse was when I drag released them).\n\nHas anyone successfully gotten Xinerama to work with multiple monitors and GPUs with 3D acceleration and X11 support?  \nDoes anyone know of a workaround such as mosaic mode with an add-ons?  \nIs there a good alternative to Unity/X11 that is stable and supports multimonitor desktops?\nDoes the nouveau driver support multi monitor better than the NVidia driver?\nWould upgrading to the newer Nvidia Drivers (I have nvidia-current: 304.117) resolve these issues?\n\nA: It sounds like you have used the option \"New X screen (requires X restart)\" in the nvidia-settings when configuring your monitors. That would explain the \"x\" cursor. Indeed, you have 3 \"Screen\" sections in your xorg.conf. If you're looking for a single desktop that spans all 3 screen, you only need a single \"Screen\" section. \nBascially, what your current xorg.conf says is to spawn 3 different copies of X (one per monitor). That's obviously not what you want. The three copies don't talk to each other, so unless you plan on running three different desktop environments (one per screen)...\nLet me see if I can fix your Xorg.conf:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Acer\"\n    ModelName      \"Acer X223W\"\n    HorizSync       31.0 - 83.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n\n    # HorizSync source: unknown, VertRefresh source: unknown\n    Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Acer\"\n    ModelName      \"Acer X223W\"\n    HorizSync       0.0 - 0.0\n    VertRefresh     0.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n\n    # HorizSync source: unknown, VertRefresh source: unknown\n    Identifier     \"Monitor2\"\n    VendorName     \"Acer\"\n    ModelName      \"Acer X223W\"\n    HorizSync       0.0 - 0.0\n    VertRefresh     0.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"Quadro 600\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:4:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"Quadro FX 580\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:5:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device2\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"Quadro FX 580\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:9:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nAlso, according to this, you have 3 different GPU's? Two are Quadro FX 580's and one Quadro 600? Is that correct? Removing the Quadro 600 should allow you do enable SLI. That is, of course, unless you're a BitCoin miner ;)\n\nA: Enabling Xinerama tends to disable compositing on nvidia and ati graphics cards.  Something in the drivers makes compositing and xinerama incompatible on them.  Compiz cannot enable the majority of its plugins (unity included) without compositing.  \nWith the advent or xrandr, xinerama should not be required to get multiple monitors to work.  That said... my experience has been that in order to use multiple GPU cards on a single system, you typically have to sacrifice compositing... thus no compiz.  Supposedly in xrandr 1.4 (13.04 and later for ubuntu) multi-gpu support is working... I have not tried it, having switched to using ATI cards with Eyefinity and using displayport monitors when I need more than 2.  That usually just works.

If you're copying several gb's or even tb's of data this can mean a huge wait time before you ever see a file conflict pop up (think 3 hours into 8 hour transfer), at that point you can select merge -> do this for all conflicts of this type. When I do a massive transfer I would like to set it and forget it.

If not how can I submit this suggestion to Ubuntu developers?\n\nA: As a workaround, you could simply create a file with the same name in both directories before starting the copy. If you name this file something like aaaaaa, the conflict will arise very early in the copying process and you will be presented with the conflict resolution dialogue early.\nThis is neither elegant nor a solution as such but it should serve as a workaround. \n", "Q: \"Failed to download repository information\" I can't update for some reasons..

When this happened on my fresh 14.04 installation I read something about nvidia-prime, and decided to give it a try.\nInstallation is really easy. Just install the NVIDIA driver using the GUI or the CLI (sudo apt-get install nvidia-331). That's all.\nYou can switch using sudo prime-select intel, sudo prime-select nvidia or using NVIDIA's control panel. You can also install an applet to quickly switch between your cards and it always shows you the card that you're currently using (Google for prime-indicator).\nMy performance using the NVIDIA driver from Ubuntu's repository was horrible. Every 5 seconds or so I had huge framedrops.\nNow I'm using the xorg-edgers PPA and performance is much better. However, NVIDIA's control panel is broken in their packages, so you'll have to use one of the other methods to switch cards.\n", "Q: Make Diodon use the Faenza-Darkest icon in the top panel The Diodon icon in my panel has a yellow colored fish that does not go well with the other icons.

I am currently trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on a Sony Vaio that came pre-installed with Windows 8 in (I understand) UEFI mode. And I am experiencing the dual-boot hell. I already tried most of the suggestions in the exhaustive Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI guide as well as Ubuntu installations when using UEFI, but I still experience issues so please do NOT mark the current question as duplicate. \nThese are the steps that I already did: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use a 64-bit 14.04\n\n*In the BIOS I could NOT find nor disable QuickBoot/FastBoot and Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT). But I did disable FastStartup in Windows 8. \n\n*In BIOS I disabled SecureBoot. \n\n*I installed 14.04 in UEFI mode (the /etc/fstab contains the UEFI partition) by using manual partitioning on the GPT hard-drive. I reduced the size of the Windows 8 partition from within Windows 8, as recommended.\n\n*After the installation I noticed dual-booting issues, so attempted to use boot-repair (following this guide). But it only ended in an error and didn't fix much. \n\n\nIssue: \nWindows 8 always boots fine. When somehow I manage to get to the grub screen then choosing Ubuntu or Windows 8 will result in either OS booting just fine. So dual-booting sort of works. However, most of the times the Vaio will simply boot to Windows 8 after a shutdown or restart. \nTo get to the grub screen reliably, I am currently using the following awkward workaround: \n\n\n*\n\n*While holding the SHIFT key, I click on Restart within Windows-8:\n\n\n*When the menu below appears, I select Use a device:\n\n\n*Then I select Ubuntu: \n\nAfterwards the GRUB menu appears and I can boot Ubuntu. For this to work I had to enable External Device Boot in BIOS and set in the Boot priority that the External Device (1) should be before the Internal HDD (2). \nQuestion: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I fix the dual-boot issues on the laptop? I would like to be able to get straight to the GRUB screen whenever I restart the computer, either from Windows 8 or from Ubuntu. \n\n\nA: One Sony user posted this:\nThe trick was to manually copy the ubuntu Boot directory in place of the \\EFI\\Boot Directory, and rename shimx64.efi to \\EFI\\Boot\\bootx64.efi (not \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi )\nBoot-Repairs fix is the rename of bootmgfw.efi, which has to be redone if Windows updates its files. And then can only boot Windows from grub menu.\nSome other options:\nAlternative to Boot-Repairs rename of shim.\nSome systems work better to register grub/shim from inside Windows - for those that keep resetting Windows as default\nGrub not showing on startup for Windows 8.1 Ubuntu 13.10 Dual boot\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\nhttps://coderwall.com/p/vfyqkg\nSome install rEFInd which seems to be another workaround.\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/index.html\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/secureboot.html\n\nA: I had the same issue here. To fix, try the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable secure boot, fastboot, etc... (you have already done that);\n\n*When installing Ubuntu, choose manual partitioning and create the partitions as follows:\n\n*\n\n*An ext4 partition for system and home (if you want). Mount point: /\n\n*A swap partition. I normally use 50% of available RAM;\n\n*A ext2 partition for boot. I think 400mb is enough. Mount point: /boot;\n\n\n*Install Ubuntu, but do not restart after the installation finishes.\n\n*Install gparted: sudo apt-get install gparted\n\n*Open gparted. Select your disk and then the boot (ext2) partition. Right click on /boot partition, select manage flags and enable bios_grub flag. Apply change and close gparted.\n\n*Install boot-repair like this link and execute it normally using recommended settings.\n\n\nIf everything is right, boot-repair will find your Windows 8 and will configure grub for you. Now, you can reboot.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Try this. I had the same problem with Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 and that worked just fine for me.\n\nA: If a boot device option does not appear for your device:\nCheck the options in the firmware menus to enable or disable BIOS-compatibility mode.\nTo use BIOS-compatibility mode, check for options in the firmware menus to disable UEFI SecureBoot features.\nFor older PCs (Windows® 7-era or earlier), look for options to Boot from file, and browse to the \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI file on that device.\nstright from MS WEBSITE\n", "Q: Cannot Activate Apache SSL (HTTPS Configuration) I've newly installed my private web server with Ubuntu 14.04 and I installed already Apache 2.4.7.\nWhen I open via Firefox http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (my IP adress) I see the \"Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page\" which indicates that Apache works.

Is there a way to make these changes permanent (edit any .conf file or something)? \n\nA: *\n\n*Install redshift,  sudo apt-get install redshift\n\n*In terminal, gnome-session-properties \n\n*Add redshift -t 6500k:6500k -g .7:.7:.7 (the first 6500k is temp color for day, the second for night, - 6500k is default temp color- you can change the values) (.7 is my gamma setting) \n\n*Install dconf-editor sudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\n*Open dconf-editor, org->gnome ->gnome-session and check \"auto-save-session\" \n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: Redshift applies additional gamma correction, so it may not play nicely with xgamma (i.e. together they may over-correct).\nMy solution is:\n\n*\n\n*Put xgamma -quiet -gamma 0.7 in session/Application Autostart\n\n*Put redshift-gtk (without gamma setting, but you can use -l LAT:LONG parameter for if location service fails) in session/Application Autostart\n\n*Have a link to run xgamma -gamma 0.7 in case something deactivates the correction\n\nThen you can deactivate Redshift temporarily, say for watching a video, and it will not affect the gamma.\n\nA: Make executable gammasettings.sh\nchmod +x gammasettings.sh\n\nThen modify the script like this\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 1\nxgamma -gamma 0.7\n\nOn my VAIO with Ubuntu 14.04 works like a charm :)\n", "Q: Wacom tablet middle mouse button scrolling So I recently got a Wacom Bamboo Pen graphics tablet, which is wonderful. I've been trying it out as a general purpose mouse on my 14.04 laptop. The only annoyance is scrolling. The tablet has no scroll wheel nor scroll buttons, and moving to the scroll bar on the screen is really very annoying.\nI remember using Windows you could click the middle mouse button to \"autoscroll\", which would be amazing with a tablet---it's exactly the sort of solution I want. I can't however, for the life of me work out how to implement this system-wide on Ubuntu. \nI am aware that there are Chrome and Firefox extensions/options for enabling this for those browsers, but I would love something system wide. I understand that middle-click is \"supposed to be\" copy/paste on Linux, but when I have Ctrl+C/V I really don't need another clipboard, what I need is easy scrolling.\nAny other solutions for simple scrolling with a graphics tablet would be much appreciated too. A keyboard shortcut perhaps?\n\nA: I wanted to enable scroll/pan actions in my wacom, like we do in Windows by pressing the mouse middle button and move the mouse to up and down.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I listed the devices using xsetwacom --list devices:\n\n\n$ xsetwacom --list devices\nWacom Intuos S Pen stylus           id: 14  type: STYLUS    \nWacom Intuos S Pen eraser           id: 15  type: ERASER    \nWacom Intuos S Pen cursor           id: 16  type: CURSOR    \nWacom Intuos S Pad pad              id: 17  type: PAD\n\n\n\n*Since I wanted to enable scroll/pan using the lower button in wacon pen (Button 2), I used the command below (where \"pan\" is the value to enable the feature in Button 2)\n\n\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Intuos S Pen stylus\" Button 2 \"pan\"\n\n\n\n*To test, go to your browser or any other document, drag the pen to up/down/left/ right while you click the pen Button 2.\n\n*To increase the sensitivity, I decreased the value of \"PanScrollThreshold\" parameter (the default value was 1300)\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Intuos S Pen stylus\" \"PanScrollThreshold\" 200\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/xsetwacom.1.html\n\n*http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man4/wacom.4.html\n\nA: As a fellow owner of Wacom tablet, I decided to make an autoscrolling utility.

The relevant one is called \"Wacom Bamboo Pen stylus\". But\n# there is nothing wrong with grabbing all 4 of them, which is why I use\n# \"Wacom\" filter to catch them all. `_grep` part comes from the fact\n# that the program is just running `xinput list | grep ${xinput_grep}`.\nxinput_grep = \"Wacom\"\n\n# Windows-like auto-scrolling.

I then physically added a clean 80GB disk to the machine, which it detects as 'sdb'.\nBasically my question is, I want to be able to add/combine the allocated amount of space from the new disk (80GB) to my machine so that instead of showing two drives (20GB and 80GB), it simply shows one drive (100GB). I'm not worried about RAID or any other special add-ons.\nI'm somewhat new to Linux, but understand that I need to use LVM to accomplish this.\nIf there is anyone who can help me out or link me to a helpful guide/tutorial, it would be very much appreciated!

To do this, I used LVM.\nTo help anyone else who might want to do this at some point, I will post here what I did.\n\nThese steps assume that you are essentially starting from scratch except having already installed Ubuntu on your machine (via \"Guided - use the entire disk and setup LVM\"), and physically added the additional disk. These steps may work if you have existing data on the machine but I can't say for sure if it would be safe to do this.\nThese commands assume the following information, and will vary depending on your setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your new disk is 'sdb' \n\n\n*\n\n*This can be found by running ls /dev/sd*\n\n\n*That your volume group name is 'ubuntu-vg'\n\n\n*\n\n*This can be found by running vgdisplay\n\n\n*That your logical volume path is '/dev/ubuntu-vg/root'\n\n\n*\n\n*This can be found by running lvdisplay\n\n\n*Your new disk is 20GB\n\n\n*\n\n*Hopefully you know how big the disk is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Logical Volume Manager (you may or may not need to do this).\nsudo apt-get install system-config-lvm\n\n\n*Convert your new disk to a physical volume (in this case, the new disk is 'sdb').\nsudo pvcreate /dev/sdb\n\n\n*Add the physical volume to the volume group via 'vgextend'.\nsudo vgextend ubuntu-vg /dev/sdb\n\n\n*Allocate the physical volume to a logical volume (extend the volume size by your new disk size).\nsudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/root\n\n\n*Resize the file system on the logical volume so it uses the additional space.\nsudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/root\n\nThat should do it. Five simple steps! You also don't have to reboot. Just run df -h and your new disk space should show allocated correctly, as well as any webapps you may be running will pick up the new disk space amount.\n\nA: I attempted to set up a large LVM disk in 14.04 64 bit Desktop with 3X500GB SATA drives.  It failed during the installation with device errors.  I found a link that states drives over 256G are the limit of the extents but I dont know if that applies here.   \nI also attempted to set up RAID (RAID 1 /boot 300MB, RAID 0 swap 2GB, and / RAID 5 everything else.  More failures.  \n\n$ sudo apt-get install -y mdadm   \n\nFrom the Live CD \"Try Ubuntu Without Installing\" option you can still install MDADM. Still no luck.  The GParted detection seems to be slightly re-Tahrded and doesnt pick up some volumes in LVM or some volumes in RAID /dev/mdX unless everything has been given a filesystem already;   \n\n$ sudo mkfs.etx4 /dev/md2  \n\nAlso, the RAID configs present even more challenges now.  MDADM doesnt seem to be added to the /target/usr/sbin package list of the install any more, and installing it there so the installation starts on reboot at all would be a huge ordeal, for which I simply dont have the time or patience, only to find out that a few more hours of work later it still didnt start on these new Windows 8 performance hacked motherboards (UEFI) for a GRUB issue.   \nInstalling LVM from Ubiquity works great, until you need to add more disks to the / (root partition, at which point you stand a very good chance of blowing the entire install. LVM resize operations keep failing and you end up back at square 1 again.  \nTrying the 14.04 server installer Partman saves the day.    \nBooted up the 14.04 Server installer, it identified the architectures just fine, installed MDADM, grub was installed to all 3 disks, and everything works great.    \n3 disks (500GB SATA)  \n3 partitions each.

If you want to enter a root shell, you should almost ever use sudo -i\nTo use your current user's directory as home, use sudo -s. Never start GUI applications from a shell started with sudo -s. The process may transfer the ownership of some important files to the root user, so you can't use them any more!. So use sudo -i to enter root shells you want to execute GUI-applications from.\nIf you just want to execute a program as root, use sudo program for command line programs and gksudo program for GUI applications.\n\nA: The behavior of sudo -i is well documented in man sudo (somewhere at the line 137):\n\n -i, --login\n             Run the shell specified by the target user's password data‐\n             base entry as a login shell.  This means that login-specific\n             resource files such as .profile or .login will be read by the\n             shell.  If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell\n             for execution via the shell's -c option.  If no command is\n             specified, an interactive shell is executed.  sudo attempts\n             to change to that user's home directory before running the\n             shell.  The command is run with an environment similar to the\n             one a user would receive at log in.  The Command Environment\n             section in the sudoers(5) manual documents how the -i option\n             affects the environment in which a command is run when the\n             sudoers policy is in use.\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*'sudo su -' vs 'sudo -i' vs 'sudo /bin/bash' - when does it matter which is used, or does it matter at all?\n\n*What are the differences between \"su\", \"sudo -s\", \"sudo -i\", \"sudo su\"?\n", "Q: Why do cdimage.ubuntu.com and releases.ubuntu.com list different images? There are two places I go when I want to download Ubuntu installer images: cdimage.ubuntu.com and releases.ubuntu.com.\nBoth of these appear equally official: they are both subdomains of ubuntu.com, and the main Ubuntu website makes references to both for its download links.  (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads uses the former for its 'Network installer' download links, and the latter for its 'BitTorrent' download links, for example.)\nIf I visit http://releases.ubuntu.com/ and follow links for the current Ubuntu release, I reach a page that lists numerous links to desktop and server installer images.  Likewise, if I visit http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ and follow links in a similar manner, I get to another very similar page that also gives numerous links to desktop and server installer images.  At the moment, these pages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/\n\n*http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/release/\n(Following '14.04' links instead of 'trusty' leads to pages identical to the above, aside from their URLs.)\nThe language used on those two pages suggests that each page lists all of the available image files. For example, they each say \"A full list of available files, including BitTorrent files, can be found below\", and they each provide a wide variety of link types (.iso, .torrent, .metalink etc).\nNeither page makes any reference to the other page's existence, and for a long time I thought that these were simply two different URLs serving essentially the same list of installer images.\nRight?\n\nNow that I look more closely I see that, despite appearances, the actual lists of files are almost entirely different.  For the Trusty release, releases serves i386 and amd64 images, whilst the cdimage site serves PowerPC and Mac-friendly images.  Even going back to the Precise release, when the architectures overlapped more, there are still installer images on each page that are not available from the other.\nI've searched for explanations as to why the two sites are so disjoint, but have so far found none.  \nI assume that releases.ubuntu.com is intended to hold the more common installer images, whilst cdimage.ubuntu.com is intended to be a more comprehensive archive, given that it also hosts installers for the various spins such as Lubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.\nHowever, this still doesn't explain some things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is there no single page I can go to and see all available images?  For example, if releases.ubuntu.com is reserved for the more popular images, why are these not also included in the (more comprehensive) list at cdimage.ubuntu.com?\n\n*If there's a good reason for keeping them separate, then why does neither page acknowledge the other as a complementary source of installer images?\n\n*Is there any historical reason for this split?\nIf anyone has any behind-the-scenes insight into this, I'd be interested to hear how things ended up this way.\n\nA: The 1st page of releases.ubuntu.com seems to me to explain why:\n\nUbuntu Releases\nThe following releases of Ubuntu are available:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn)\n  \n*Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (Trusty Tahr)\n  \n*Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander)\n  \n*Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail)\n  \n*Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal)\n  \n*Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (Precise Pangolin)\n  \n*Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS (Lucid Lynx)\nWe are happy to provide hosting for the following projects via the\n  cdimage server. While they are not\n  commercially supported by Canonical, they receive full support from their\n  communities.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Edubuntu\n  \n*Kubuntu\n  \n*Lubuntu\n  \n*Mythbuntu\n  \n*Ubuntu GNOME\n  \n*UbuntuKylin\n  \n*UbuntuStudio\n  \n*Xubuntu\nThe cdimage server also hosts releases of other Ubuntu images not found on\n  this server, such as builds for less popular architectures and other non-standard\n  and unsupported images.  For Ubuntu Desktop and Server on popular architectures,\n  please see the links above instead.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Unsupported Ubuntu Images\nFor old releases, see\n  old-releases.ubuntu.com.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*releases.ubuntu.com\nContains only current commercially supported releases images (i386 & amd64 only, 5 years period max LTS for server editions).\n\n*old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/\nOld releases images that no longer supported.\n\n*cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/\nCommercially unsupported favors and builds including alpha, beta and daily builds.\n\n*cloud-images.ubuntu.com, old sub-domain is still working too uec-images.ubuntu.com\n\nUbuntu Cloud Images are pre-installed disk images that have been customized by Ubuntu engineering to run on cloud-platforms such as Amazon EC2, Openstack, Windows and LXC.\n\nIt was there in 2010 as shown in the history of UEC/Images Wiki page, Revision 2 as of 2010-08-19 20:59:56.\nAs canonical is a company that provides technical support, it should have should have such kind of separation.\nLooking to the official links on www.ubuntu.com. They are all point to releases.ubuntu.com except Network installer and Ubuntu Kylin.\nAnother thing, they always try to minimize mirror size and mirroring daily builds just wasting of resources. Mirror script point only to releases.ubuntu.com\nI couldn't find out any official note about such decision yet. But separation between releases and other builds back to 2005 at least. See Ubuntu Server Project Unleashed!. Even back to Oct 2004 with release of Ubuntu 4.10 which is the first release(just i386), Make a look on these few early mails from ubuntu-announce archive.\n\nA: As you pointed out, release.ubuntu.com is intended to hold more common installer image, whereas cdimage.ubuntu.com is for other images, like PowerPC or Kubuntu.\nIn my opinion, Canonical intended to split installers based on their popularity, since Ubuntu installer images are usually distributed using mirrors. Operators of mirror services can choose  what type of mirror they want to copy.\nFor example, http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/ubuntu-releases/ (Ubuntu mirror \"University of Waterloo Computer Science Club\") has images of releases.ubuntu.com and there is a link for cdimage server.\n", "Q: Install MAAS before I Install MAAS? Maybe I'm not understanding how the setup exactly works, but every guide I find on how to initially set up MAAS (in order to use juju and ubuntu to create a cloud environment) there is a step for me to add an Ubuntu MAAS API address.  How would I already have a MAAS API address if this is my first time setting up anything with MAAS?  It's obvious to me that I'm not understanding something about the configuration.  Can anyone clear this up for me?  \nAlso, I feel like I understand the basics of how MAAS and juju work together, so please don't just link to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuCloudInfrastructure , because I've read that pretty thoroughly.  I just need to know what this whole MASS API is about for a first time installer who's never setup anything related to MAAS before.  Thanks,\n\nA: The first thing you install is the region-controller/cluster-controller. You have to tell the controller the address it should give to the nodes to tell them how to reach the cluster-controller. \nSo in many (simple) cases the address will just be the address of the server you are setting up right now.\n\nA: MAAS API is two things, first and what I use the most is a webpage.  The MAAS API address is the ip address of the computer the MAAS regional controller is on.  This webpage allows you to allocate nodes to different users, setup networking, and for the most part configure MAAS settings to make it work correctly.\nInstall MAAS can be done in one of two ways.  When Ubuntu is installed, select the \"Multiple server install with MAAS\".  This is the second or third screen into the install, after it asks which language to select. \nThe second is just to install.\nsudo apt-get install maas\n\nIf you use this command you will also need to run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-region-controller\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller \n\nThese will ask you for the ip address of your maas server.  If you change the ipaddress of your MAAS server you will need to run these commands again.\nThe MAAS API is also a set of command line tools too.  Everything you can do with the webpage you can do with a command line tool and a lot more.  I personally don't use the command line tools because it is easy to mess things up and not be able to see exactly what I did.\n\nA: If you need to login to the API for commandline access, you can create a user 'profile'. This effectively authorises the running user access to the API\nHave you checked out the actual MAAS documentaion? There is a section on this with screenshots and everything.\nhttps://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/maascli.html#api-key\nBasically, you need to login to the MAAS server web interface to access the key which is autogenerated when you install MAAS. \n", "Q: samba.cnf security parameter is not present in smb.conf The security = parameter is missing in the samba smb.conf file in Ubuntu 16.04.\nWas the securty = paramiter removed from newer versions of Samba.

I want to disable the internal webcam of my laptop running Ubuntu 13.10? As suggested here, I already disabled the concerning kernel modules by blacklisting them. But after reboot the modules are loaded nevertheless. What can I do to get rid of these modules?\nMy module blacklist lies in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-webcam.conf and looks like this:\nblacklist videodev\nblacklist videobuf2_core\nblacklist videobuf2_memops\nblacklist videobuf2_vmalloc\nblacklist uvcvideo\n\nBut lsmod gives me (after reboot):\nModule                  Size  Used by\nuvcvideo               80885  0 \nvideobuf2_vmalloc      13216  1 uvcvideo\nvideobuf2_memops       13362  1 videobuf2_vmalloc\nvideobuf2_core         40499  1 uvcvideo\nvideodev              133509  2 uvcvideo,videobuf2_core\n\nEdit:\nWhen I do a sudo modprobe -r uvcvideo the modules are gone. So I could write a script to do that. But I would not consider that as a clean solution ;-)\n\nA: *\n\n*In your blacklist.conf change blacklist videodev to install videodev /bin/false\n\n*update-initramfs -u\n\n*reboot\nFor more details see Kernel Modules Blacklisting on the Arch Wiki:\n\nBlacklisting\nBlacklisting, in the context of kernel modules, is a mechanism to\n  prevent the kernel module from loading. This could be useful if, for\n  example, the associated hardware is not needed, or if loading that\n  module causes problems: for instance there may be two kernel modules\n  that try to control the same piece of hardware, and loading them\n  together would result in a conflict.\nSome modules are loaded as part of the initramfs. mkinitcpio -M will\n  print out all automatically detected modules: to prevent the initramfs\n  from loading some of those modules, blacklist them in\n  /etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf. Running mkinitcpio -v will list all\n  modules pulled in by the various hooks (e.g. filesystems hook, block\n  hook, etc.). Remember to add that .conf file to the FILES section in\n  /etc/mkinitcpio.conf, if you have not done so already, and rebuild the\n  initramfs once you have blacklisted the modules, and reboot\n  afterwards.\nUsing files in /etc/modprobe.d/\nCreate a .conf file inside /etc/modprobe.d/ and append a line for each\n  module you want to blacklist, using the blacklist keyword. If for\n  example you want to prevent the pcspkr module from loading:\n/etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf\n\n# Do not load the 'pcspkr' module on boot.\nblacklist pcspkr\n\nNote: The blacklist command will blacklist a module so that it will\n  not be loaded automatically, but the module may be loaded if another\n  non-blacklisted module depends on it or if it is loaded manually.\nHowever, there is a workaround for this behaviour; the install command\n  instructs modprobe to run a custom command instead of inserting the\n  module in the kernel as normal, so you can force the module to always\n  fail loading with:\n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n...\ninstall module_name /bin/false\n...\n\nThis will effectively blacklist that module and any other that depends\n  on it.\n\n\nA: Just putting the list of modules in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.uvcdrver.conf should work. The file name can be anything. Just make sure the format and permissions are correct. \n\nA: Thank you all very much for your help! I found the source of the problem while trying bain's solution. His solution works well. After reboot the modules were really gone. But there is one drawback: I can not load the module via modprobe uvcvideo in case I want to re-enable the webcam.\nWhile digging through my system in order to find out, why the uvcvideo module was loaded, I finally made a grep -r uvcvideo /etc/ and voilà, I found a script in /etc/pm/power.d which did a modprobe uvcvideo when the power cable is plugged in. I wrote this script some time ago to optimize the power consumption. I commented out the lines dealing with the webcam module and after that, the blacklist worked!\n\nA: I would suggest you run \nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nafter modifying your blacklist. This will update your initial ramdisk.\n\nA: In the case that you were after a solution in one command line instruction this might be helpful (based on this answer):\nTo disable the camera until reboot use this command:\nsudo modprobe -r uvcvideo\n\nType your password and if there are no errors shown in the terminal, your webcam should be disabled. If you got the error message: modprobe: FATAL: Module uvcvideo is in use, you can try to force its removal with:\nsudo rmmod -f uvcvideo\n\nTo enable your webcam back again, type in shell:\nsudo modprobe uvcvideo\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Dual Boot Installation Here is some information.

Enter /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64\n\n*Create the desktop icon for future access from my GUI menu.\n# /home/USERNAME/.local/share/applications/sqldeveloper.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Oracle SQL Developer\nGenericName=SQL Developer\nX-GNOME-FullName=Oracle SQL Developer\nComment= A free integrated development environment that simplifies the development and management of Oracle Database\nKeywords=sql;developer;oracle;db;database\nExec=/home/USERNAME/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper.sh\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nIcon=/home/USERNAME/sqldeveloper/icon.png\nCategories=Admin\nX-AppStream-Ignore=true\n\nMake the desktop file executable\nchmod +x /home/USERNAME/.local/share/applications/sqldeveloper.desktop\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Java 6. (It didn't work for me with Java 1.7):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install oracle-java6-installer  \n\n\n*Download the SQL Developer from here and choose Other platforms. (You'll need an account in order to download it). Open the Downloads directory: \ncd ~/Downloads\n\nand extract the file to /opt:\nsudo unzip sqldeveloper-*-no-jre.zip -d /opt/  \n\n\n*Make the launch script executable:\nsudo chmod +x /opt/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper.sh\n\n\n*Open sqldeveloper:  \nsudo /opt/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper.sh\n\nThe first time you'll be asked to enter the jvm location. In my case (and probably yours if you have followed the first step), the location is: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle .  \n\nA: I installed oracle sqldeveloper in ubuntu 17.10 using the following method: \n\n\n*\n\n*Accept license agreement and download oracle linux rpm: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html\n\n*Install alien:\nsudo apt-get install alien\n\n*Install the rpm using alien:\nsudo alien -i sqldeveloper-17.3.1.279.0537-1.noarch.rpm\n\n*Run sql developer by using the following command in the terminal\nsqldeveloper\nMake sure to change the version of your rpm. \nFor this to be successful you have to have oracle java 8 or above installed in your machine.\n\nA: I installed SQL Developer with these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*(See the comments—this might not be necessary)\nDownload and re-install newest Ubuntu 14.04 LTS from Ubuntu website.\n\n*Install Java:\n\n\n*\n\n*Java Version JDK 7:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk openjdk-7-jre icedtea-7-plugin\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\n\n*Java Version JDK 8 (in some installations this is a requirement instead of 1.7):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\n\n\n*Download SQL Developer from Oracle website (I chose Other Platforms download).\n\n*Extract file to /opt:\nsudo unzip sqldeveloper-*-no-jre.zip -d /opt/\nsudo chmod +x /opt/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper.sh\n\n\n*Linking over an in-path launcher for Oracle SQL Developer:\nsudo ln -s /opt/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper.sh /usr/local/bin/sqldeveloper\n\n\n*Edit /opt/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper.sh and replace it's content to:\n#!/bin/bash\nunset -v GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID\ncd /opt/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper/bin\n./sqldeveloper \"$@\"\n\nor (to prevent error: ./sqldeveloper: Permission denied)\n#!/bin/bash\nunset -v GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID\ncd /opt/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper/bin && bash sqldeveloper $*\n\n\n*Run SQL Developer:\nsqldeveloper\n\n\nNote: When you run Sql Developer at the first time, you need to\n  specify the path of JDK's folder. In my computer, JDK stored at\n  /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64\n  For Java 8 and Ubuntu 16+ /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle\n\n\n*Finally, create desktop application for easy to use:\ncd /usr/share/applications/\nsudo vim sqldeveloper.desktop\n\nadd this lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nExec=sqldeveloper\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GNOME;Oracle;\nType=Application\nIcon=/opt/sqldeveloper/icon.png\nName=Oracle SQL Developer\n\nthen type:\nsudo update-desktop-database\n\n", "Q: What is sudo apt-get -f install? what is the usage of apt-get -f install . when I run sudo apt-get update I got some errors at the end It says try apt-get -f install. What is this command?  the last part of my error is :\n\n. . .  \ngoing to be installed  \nE: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).\n\n\n\nA: See the manpage:\n-f, --fix-broken\n   Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place.\n   This option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages\n   to permit APT to deduce a likely solution. If packages are\n   specified, these have to completely correct the problem. The option\n   is sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time; APT\n   itself does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a\n   system. It is possible that a system's dependency structure can be\n   so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which usually means\n   using dselect(1) or dpkg --remove to eliminate some of the\n   offending packages).

Im trying to get the program to run unrar on torrents but it doesn't work.  The command:\nsudo unrar x -r %f/%n/*.rar /mnt/ \n\nworks when typed in the command prompt and I can enter a sudo password, but obviously I cant do that within the program.  \nI guess basically, how do I either give qbittorrent-nox root rights or make unrar not require them?\n\nA: You would need to either: \n\n\n*\n\n*Change the write permission of the target directory (in this case /mnt, which is a system folder owned by root by default) so it is accessible by your own user, or\n\n*Change the target directory to somewhere where your user has write access.\n\n\nEither of those ways will prevent you from having to use sudo.\n\nA: You can do this by editing the /etc/sudoers file. The command to edit the file is 'sudo visudo'. I'll post the commands to add in an edit.\n", "Q: How do I prevent one of my partitions messing with Lubuntu Grub entries? I recently deleted my Windows XP partition in my dual boot machine (Lubuntu/Windows XP), replacing it with Bhodi Linux. Everything went smoothly, but now I have a problem: Bodhi Linux is messing with my Lubuntu Grub entries, and every time I update something of significance there, Grub ends looking like this:\n\nIs there a way to prevent this? I know how to edit Grub entries, but it seems like quite an annoyance have to do this with every update.\n(Yesterday I updated Lubuntu from 13.10 to 14.04 and that seemed to fix the issue. But later on I updated Bodhi Linux and there it was again)\n\nA: Do not know Bodhi, but with Ubuntu.\nTo see what drive grub2 uses see this line   - grub-pc/install_devices:\nsudo debconf-show grub-pc\nsudo grub-probe -t device /boot/grub\n\nto get grub2 to remember where to reinstall on updates:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nEnter thru first pages,spacebar to choose/unchoose drive, enter to accept, do not choose partitions\nIf Bodhi works the same, do it first and unchoose everything. Then it will not reinstall. \nBoot into Lubuntu and run it to make Lubuntu install to sda and be the system to boot by default.\n\nA: Where the default drive is isn't the problem. The extra entries is. I would like to know the answer to that, too. I have several hot plug sata drives that are most of the time removed, but, sometimes when I am working on line, I find the next time I boot, that all these drives are included in the grub. It is extremely annoying. The easiest solution is to store the grub you want in a place where the parties involved don't have access to it, be it mechanized, or otherwise. Then all you have to do is change ownership & slap it back in.\n\nA: You have this issue because Bodhi Linux and Ubuntu are using the same bootloader (grub) and each have there own mechanisms for keeping grub up to date. This isn't really broken , it's by design however I understand the annoyance. I've answered a similar question here for Ubuntu kernel selection that you can apply to your situation. Since the same package is available for Bodhi I can't think of any reason you couldn't run it under both Ubuntu and Bodhi and insure that the grub boot configurations on both systems offer the same choices in grub in the same order.  \n", "Q: What changed in apache2 from saucy to trusty for projects in /var/www I have some web roots in directories x,y,z, etc. in /var/www/, some of them (not /var/www/) are mounted with options rw,bind,uid=301,gid=301 (301 is uid of user www-data and gid of group www-data). This worked very well in default apache2 of saucy, but no longer with upgraded version in trusty. All permissions of all files and directories under /var/www/ are owned by www-data:www-data.

Sometimes you need to run dist-upgrade a few times, or some new package may overwrite a file that APT refuses to do, so in those cases you can manually dpkg --force-overwrite those packages if you come across them.\n\nA: Well, I too had a lot of broken packages. I just downloaded the 14.04 ISO and installed with the preserver data option. It preserves all your data, but it will delete all non-supported packages.\nBut when you reinstall them, their data is not lost.\nThe above applies, of course, if your /home and / are on different partitions. If they are on the same partition, you'll either want to back up /home, reinstall and restore or fix your packages.\nAlso try:\n$ sudo apt-get install --fix-broken\n\nThat will clean up as much as it can.\nHappy to help.\n\nA: Executing the following command solved the problem for me and I proceeded successfully with the upgrade:\nsudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\n", "Q: Blacklisting Nouveau not working on Ubuntu 14.04 I know there is plenty of documentation on blacklisting the Nouveau driver. However the normal methods are not working for me. I tried adding the below lines in the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file, however this does not work. Nouveau still gets loaded anyway. \nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\nI tried to disable the kernel modules using this command:\necho options nouveau modeset=0 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-kms.conf\n\nfollowed by: \nupdate-initramfs -u\n\nbut it doesn't work. Nouveau still gets loaded anyway.\n\nA: You may need to edit grub to prevent the kernel from ever loading nouveau at boot.

I'm about to ship my laptop to tech support and I started thinking, I don't want them going through my downloads or family photos, etc, however they require the administrator password.  The problem with the laptop isn't even software related though, purely hardware.  \nIs there a way to give tech support the admin password, so they can make sure it boots correctly and what not, but to protect some of my personal files?\nWhat about passwords saved in Chrome?  They could start Chrome and see all of my passwords.\nWould a regular user/guest account work in this way and still satisfy tech support?\nI've got business docs, (S)FTP passwords, and other information that just doesn't need the chance to leak out, regardless of whether I trust the company's support or not.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can move files to an encrypted fold.\nFirst install encfs:\nsudo apt-get install encfs\n\nInstall optional GUI:\nsudo apt-get install cryptkeeper\n\nCreate an encrypted folder:\nencfs  ~/backup\n\nThis command will promt you for a password and some other options.\nMove files you want to \"hide\", to the ~/backup folder.\nIn order to close the ~/backup directory simply type: \nfusermount -u ~/backup\n\nAs long as the directory is closed all the information in ~/backup will seem to have disappeared. The only way to gain access to this information again is by unlocking it. This can be done in a terminal by typing: \nencfs ~/backup\n\nYou will be asked for the proper password to gain access. \nFor more information, see help.ubuntu.com.\n", "Q: Why does package mercurial depend on x11-common in a chroot'ed environment? In relation to a previous question I posed (Make apt-get (or aptitude) run with -y but not prompt for replacement of configuration files?) I came across a somewhat peculiar and hard to explain behavior. Perhaps someone can explain it still.\nWhen I execute the following right after a debootstap inside the target chroot, package mercurial appears to require a lot more than seems logical:\napt-get -s -y -o Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef -o Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold install mercurial\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\n  ca-certificates fontconfig-config fonts-dejavu-core libdrm-intel1\n  libdrm-nouveau2 libdrm-radeon1 libelf1 libfontconfig1 libfontenc1\n  libfreetype6 libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx libglapi-mesa libice6\n  libllvm3.4 libpciaccess0 libsm6 libtcl8.6 libtk8.6 libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0\n  libutempter0 libx11-6 libx11-data libx11-xcb1 libxau6 libxaw7 libxcb-dri2-0\n  libxcb-dri3-0 libxcb-glx0 libxcb-present0 libxcb-shape0 libxcb-sync1 libxcb1\n  libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxdmcp6 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxft2 libxi6\n  libxinerama1 libxmu6 libxmuu1 libxpm4 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxshmfence1\n  libxss1 libxt6 libxtst6 libxv1 libxxf86dga1 libxxf86vm1 mercurial-common\n  openssl tcl tcl8.6 tk tk8.6 x11-common x11-utils xbitmaps xterm\nSuggested packages:\n  libglide3 qct vim emacs kdiff3 kdiff3-qt kompare meld tkcvs mgdiff\n  python-mysqldb python-pygments python-openssl tcl-tclreadline mesa-utils\n  xfonts-cyrillic\nRecommended packages:\n  wish\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  ca-certificates fontconfig-config fonts-dejavu-core libdrm-intel1\n  libdrm-nouveau2 libdrm-radeon1 libelf1 libfontconfig1 libfontenc1\n  libfreetype6 libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx libglapi-mesa libice6\n  libllvm3.4 libpciaccess0 libsm6 libtcl8.6 libtk8.6 libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0\n  libutempter0 libx11-6 libx11-data libx11-xcb1 libxau6 libxaw7 libxcb-dri2-0\n  libxcb-dri3-0 libxcb-glx0 libxcb-present0 libxcb-shape0 libxcb-sync1 libxcb1\n  libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxdmcp6 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxft2 libxi6\n  libxinerama1 libxmu6 libxmuu1 libxpm4 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxshmfence1\n  libxss1 libxt6 libxtst6 libxv1 libxxf86dga1 libxxf86vm1 mercurial\n  mercurial-common openssl tcl tcl8.6 tk tk8.6 x11-common x11-utils xbitmaps\n  xterm\n0 upgraded, 64 newly installed, 0 to remove and 3 not upgraded.\n\nLooking at the output from apt-cache depends it's beyond me why apt-get decides that these dependencies have to be installed.\nAs you can see I am passing Dpkg options as described in the above linked question. The main intention behind it is to prevent apt-get and ultimately dpkg from prompting during what is supposed to be an automated installation.\nHowever, I have tried running the same without passing those options and the result is the same.\n\nA: The mercurial package recommends wish, which is a virtual package provided by tk. This is the package that is pulling in all of the X-related packages that you see being installed as dependencies in the chroot.\nWhat you probably want to do is install mercurial without recommended packages by adding the --no-install-recommends option to apt-get.

I did that and it still hadn't taken effect, but nothing had changed either.\n\n*I looked further and found I had to do sudo restart lightdm. I did that and it did its thing, but when I tried to log back in, I couldn't type.\n\n*I shut down and tried again, but I still couldn't type. I went to onscreen keyboard and it said No X keyboard found, retrying…\n\n\nI don't even have a USB keyboard or anything, it's a laptop with the keyboard built in. I can't do anything because my keyboard doesn't work and I have no idea what to do. Help!\n\nA: Just had this happen. I was editing /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc (remapping alt to ctrl) but forgot a semicolon and could not use my keyboard to log in. \nI restarted using GRUB to select recovery mode and then root terminal mode. Keyboard worked in the simple root terminal and I was able to edit and fix .../pc. Phew!\n\nA: I had the same happen after making some (apparently) bad changes to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc and rm /var/lib/xkb/*.xkm. \nI ended up being able to recover by logging in as guest, clicking open the wifi menu, clicking Connection Information, getting the IPv4 address, and ssh'ing in from my other computer. Then I undid my bad changes to pc, quit the ssh connection, and restarted the Ubuntu box. The keyboard worked normally when the login screen came back up.\nNote that this wouldn't have worked if I had been following decent security practices and not allowed root via ssh, but this was a fairly new install and I hadn't gotten around to that yet.\n\nA: Had the same problem. Reinstalled xkb-data package using Ubuntu Software Center (by mouse only) and it was fixed.\nThe package can be found here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=xkb-data\n\nA: I have resolved the same problem by creating a text file with the password on a USB key using a different computer, and then inserting the USB key and copy-pasting the password from the text file using mouse only. Then I reinstalled xkb-data using the answer above and synaptic. It worked.\nIf you do not have autologin, this possibility might not work for you, since I do not think the USB key gets automounted if you are not logged in. Then I think you could just restart the computer, choose recovery mode from Grub and then enter as superuser. The keyboard should work here. Then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remount the filesystem as read/write: \n\n\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n\n*\n\n*Use apt-get to reinstall\n\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xbd-data\nI did not have to try it this way, but this should work too I think.\n\nA: I had the same problem when I edited the US layouts. Ctrl+Alt+F1-7 weren't working on my default layout.\nMy solution was to switch to a secondary non-English layout I had installed, use Ctrl+Alt+F1-7, then log in normally and run sudo apt-get install --reinstall xkb-data.\nWord of advice to anyone messing with custom layouts - always have a secondary backup layout enabled for stuff like this. Latin letters are preferable but whatever allows you to use Ctrl+Alt+F1-7 works.\n\nA: I was also struggling with this and solved it by just using an ubuntu live usb disk and replacing the keyboard symbols/pc file by the default one. A simple solution, but it took me a while before I thought of it so I hope this helps other people.\n", "Q: Soundfont with Timidity Is there an easy intuitive (user-friendly) way to use a soundfont with timidity ?\nI have seen some complicated how-to but it's not convenient at all for a end-user.\n\nA: I struggled with this recently; it turned out to be simple ...\nNautilus > file system/etc/timidity/timidity.cfg\nUse gedit to look at the file; as it happened, lucky me, both soundfonts were in the folder!

Most of them are soft scratching noises, but I'm not sure if it has to do with a failing drive. I just got this computer last year.\nI ran the commands from Fix for Constant Hard Drive Clicking Noise in Ubuntu and Problem with hard drive clicking, even though my computer's hard drive is not clicking, just scratching. It helped some, but I can still hear the sounds. I don't really recall hearing them when I had Windows installed prior to Ubuntu 14.04.\nI also ran the tests on this blog and got a number of 193 for the Load_Cycle_Count and 9 for Power_On_Hours. The blog said that if you divide the Load_Cycle_Count by the Power_On_Hours, you should get a number less than 15, though I got 21.4.\nSo far, I haven't had any issues or warnings relating to the hard drive, and speed is as good as on Windows!\n\nA: If your hard drive makes new sounds that it hasn't made before, it could be an early sign of damage to the drive.\nThe other possibility is that it's simply normal sounds that the drive makes, but you haven't heard before, perhaps because of different usage patterns.  Drives can make clicking noises when seeking in particular patterns or when parking their heads, and these can happen at different times depending on the software being used.\nEither way you should always have regular, recent backups should the drive fail.  This is true of all hard drives, not just ones that you are noticing unusual sounds from.\nShould any other hard drive diagnostics - either filesystem checks or SMART monitoring tools - pick up any errors this would be further evidence the drive may be failing.\nWhether you should replace the drive immediately depends on whether you can easily afford it, weighing up the cost of the new drive versus the slight risk your drive may fail earlier than it otherwise would have.  But there is no such thing as a hard drive that won't fail.  It's just a matter of time.\n\nI didn't know if installing Ubuntu nulled the warranty or not. \n\nNo, it shouldn't affect any warranties against hardware faults, at least.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu 14.04 dual boot i wanted to ask How to install Ubuntu 14.04 dual boot .\ni have windows 8.1 pre-installed and i downloaded the Ubuntu 14.04 and i want to dual boot them . please tell me how do i do that. please do help. \n\nA: *\n\n*Backup your Windows partitions\n\n*Shrink the Windows partition\n\n*Create a bootable USB drive with Ubuntu on it\n\n*Turn off fast boot and Disable secure boot\n\n*Run the Ubuntu installer\n\n*Partition the empty space (created after shrinking Windows\npartition)\n\n*Complete the installation\n\n*Reboot into the Ubuntu Live image\n\n*Run the boot repair\nread here\n", "Q: Why are there Mac installation CDs for Ubuntu, but not Xubuntu? The 64-bit installation CDs for Ubuntu 14.04 come in two versions: for Macs and all other AMD64s. The reason for this is apparently the failure of Macs to boot multi-catalog CDs.\nWhy is there only one version of Xubuntu then?\nWill the Xubuntu CD boot on a Mac?\n\nA: Although Xubuntu is an official flavor of Ubuntu, it is community-supported rather than managed directly by Canonical. \nProjects such as Xubuntu are independent community-based projects and do not necessarily follow everything that Canonical does with the mainline release. \nThe simple reason for not creating images for Macs is that it is not part of the project's goals, plus they are unlikely to have the resources or volunteers needed to create such images.\nThis is not the only area where the community-supported flavors differ the Unity release. For example, Xubuntu 14.04 is an LTS release, but it will be supported for only 3 years rather than 5 years. Similarly, in Lubuntu 12.04 is not an LTS release at all. \n", "Q: error: parsing file '/var/lib/dpkg/updates/0013' near line 0: EOF after field name installing ubuntu.desktop failed and I get message\nE: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run sudo dpkg --configure -a to correct.\n\nWhen I run that command I get the following message:\ndpkg: error: parsing file '/var/lib/dpkg/updates/0013' near line 0: EOF after field name.\n\nI'm trying to reinstall the ubuntu.desktop but not sure how to proceed.\nany ideas would be appreciated.\n\nA: Run these commands in terminal.

Sometimes I crop PDFs in order to have a one-page reading instead of a scanned two pages. However, nautilus keeps an old thumbnail showing the former front page.\nI know that I can delete the hidden thumbnails folder, but I'd like to know how can I regenerate only one specific thumbnail. F5 doesn't help.\n\nA: According to the freedesktop documentation Thumbnail Managing Standard\n. You can force nautilus to recreate the thumbnail if the mtime (modification time) in the thumbnail is lower than the mtime in the original file.\n\n\n  \n*Detect Modifications\n  \n  \n  One important thing is to assure that the thumbnail image displays the\n  same information than the original, only in a downscaled version. To\n  make this possible we use the modification time stored in the required\n  'Thumb::MTime' key and check if it's equal the current modification\n  time of the original. If not we must recreate the thumbnail.\nExample 2. Algorithm to check for modification.\nif (file.mtime != thumb.MTime) {\n        recreate_thumbnail (); }\nIt is not sufficient to do a file.mtime > thumb.MTime check. If the user moves >another file over the original, where the mtime changes but is in fact lower than >the thumbnail stored mtime, we won't recognize this modification.\n\nIn order to achieve this... you can try with a little Nautilus-Script to set the mtime in the original file to the current time with the touch command.\n1) Creating the script. Open a Terminal window Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\nFor Ubuntu 12.04 & 12.10\n\n\n*\n\n*nano ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Regenerate-Thumbnail\nFor Ubuntu 13.04 & above\n\n\n*\n\n*nano ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/Regenerate-Thumbnail\n2) The content of the script.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nBAKIFS=$IFS\nIFS=$'\\n'\n\nfor FILE in $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS; do\n      touch -m \"$FILE\"\ndone\n\nIFS=$BAKIFS\n\n\nTo save the changes in nano.. Ctrl+O,Enter then Ctrl+X.\n3) To make the script executable.\nFor Ubuntu 12.04 & 12.10\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod +x ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Regenerate-Thumbnail\nFor Ubuntu 13.04 & above\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod +x ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/Regenerate-Thumbnail\n4) To test the script you can open nautilus, select a file(s), right click and go to  Scripts > Regenerate-Thumbnail.\n\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but... sometime the thumbnails get stuck and no trick with touch -m or mv makes it regenerate. \nWrite this simple script (thanks to this answer), let's call it find-gnome-thumbnail:\n#! /bin/bash \n#\nfn=$(echo -n \"$1\" | md5sum | awk '{print $1}')\nfind $HOME/.cache/ -name \"$fn*\" 2> /dev/null\n\nand feed it with the canonical name of the file of which you want to determine the thumbnail location. The better way to do this is to select the file in nautilus, do ctrlC, and in a terminal write  find-gnome-thumbnail ' (with the space and the opening single quote) and after that shiftctrlV; add the closing quote and  you'll have something like this: \n % ./find-gnome-thumbnail 'file:///home/romano/tmp/0101_IM_3026506.pdf' \n/home/romano/.cache/thumbnails/large/d090cf90d2ac3f8127f62043f06b66df.png\n\nNow you can delete the offending thumbnail and it will be regenerated (press F5 if it does not happen alone). The copy-paste trick take care of strange chars conversions: \n % ./find-gnome-thumbnail 'file:///home/romano/tmp/lalla%20(copy).pdf'\n /home/romano/.cache/thumbnails/large/28864dd40fab6d4982e1b103365574da.png\n\nSometime the script fails if you rename the file with mv, I do not know why --- but it's ok most of the times. Also deleting the thumbnail manually does not regenerate it immediately --- again, I am at a loss here. \n\nA: I have a script that I use (author unknown) called Auto Thumbnailer which works fine for this.

I was able to refresh failed thumbnails by deleting the ~/.cache/thumbnails/fail directory\n\nA: Simplified answer (based on @Roman Raguet)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Go to the folder where your files are, for example, /home/me/myimages\n\n*Execute touch -m\n\n\n*\n\n*Either to a single file, for example, touch -m myfile.jpg\n\n*Or to all files, touch -m *\nNow the thumbnails should be regenerated in your nautilus.\n\nA: In my case touch -m * and touch * only re-generate all but still not re-generate for the problematic images. md5sum of that images also not found in ~/.cache/.\nThen I do experiment by copy all \"ok\" images to other directory to backup, leaving only 3 problematic images in that folder, and use strace to debug what path it open, does it open ~/.cache/thumbnails as other answer mentioned? (The log below is my second attempt with 1 problematic image):\nxb@dnxb:~/.cache/thumbnails/normal$ strace -f -e open,openat nautilus '<My Directory>' |& grep -ni thumbnail\n...\n1428:[pid 30799] openat(AT_FDCWD, \"/home/xiaobai/.cache/thumbnails/fail/gnome-thumbnail-factory/d3b419c7166b51189307c0c0c9e1e559.png\", O_RDONLY) = 36\n^C\n\nI observed that 3 images inside ~/.cache/thumbnails/fail/ which has different md5sum, no wonder md5sum trick is not working.\nThen I try eog <original image path> (\"Eye of GNOME\" program) to think and surprising me, thumbnails get re-generate in nautilus when try strace second time with this log:\nxb@dnxb:~/.cache/thumbnails/normal$ strace -f -e open,openat nautilus '<My Directory>' |& gi thumbnail\n...\n1422:[pid 30904] openat(AT_FDCWD, \"/home/xiaobai/.cache/thumbnails/normal/d3b419c7166b51189307c0c0c9e1e559.png\", O_RDONLY) = 36\n...\n1428:[pid 30909] openat(AT_FDCWD, \"/home/xiaobai/.cache/thumbnails/normal/d3b419c7166b51189307c0c0c9e1e559.png\", O_RDONLY) = 35\n...\n^C\nxb@dnxb:~/.cache/thumbnails/normal$ \n\nThe thumbnails with the same md5 filename moved into ~/.cache/thumbnails/normal/ from ~/.cache/thumbnails/fail/\nSo run eog * command from terminal can fix this too (Note: I did touch -m * and touch * before, and strace nautilus to view the image outcome). And for OP question, can use eog <image path>.\n", "Q: How to reset unity panel in Ubuntu 14.04 When I click my setting icon its shows only name in menu. Please see the image\n\nI already tried unity-reset, compiz reset method and unity reset icons.\nPlease provide a solution for this madness. \n\nA: Before trying this you might want to create another admin account just in case something happens.\nThis might be a solution, however, it is a bit inconvenient:\nYou could create a new directory in /home/ and call it for example 'home-backup'. Then move all your files of your home directory into 'home-backup' e.g. using nautilus as root (don't forget the .-files!)\nThen you can just logout and login and everything should be like it was.\n(Note: unless you don't copy some files from 'home-backup' e.g. your browser will also be like it was after you installed your system)\n", "Q: grub 2 fails to boot win 7 I have just installed kubuntu 13.10 on a windows 7 machine but now grub is unable to find the win 7 boot option..:(\nI have installed and ran boot-repair to generate the diagnostic link.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7370400\nThe steps i took in creating the kubuntu installation can be found here .\nHow do I partition my Hard drive to install Kubuntu? \nPlease can you help me reconfigure grub2.0 to find the win 7 boot option.\nregards\npeter\n\nA: You either left Windows hibernated or it needs chkdsk.\nPartition table says sda1 is NTFS, but none of the Linux tools can mount it to see that it is a bootable partition. If it needs chkdsk or if hibernated, the NTFS driver will not mount a NTFS partition to prevent further damage.\nYou need a Windows repair disk and run chkdsk on sda1. \nYou may be able to reinstall a Windows boot loader to the MBR temporarily to boot Windows and see if you can use f8 to get into its own repair console.\nBut then you have to reinstall grub after fixing Windows.

Alternatively, using the MAAS CLI commands, run:\n$ maas my-maas-session node-groups import-boot-images\nThe configuration file that defines what images to download is in /etc/maas/bootresources.yaml. It looks like this:\nboot:\n  sources:\n  - keyring: /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring.gpg\n    path: http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/releases/\n    selections:\n    - arches:\n      - i386\n      - amd64\n      labels:\n      - release\n      - rc\n      release: trusty\n      subarches:\n      - generic\n    - arches:\n      - i386\n      - amd64\n      labels:\n      - release\n      release: precise\n      subarches:\n      - generic\n  storage: /var/lib/maas/boot-resources/\n\nTo limit what gets downloaded, remove one or more entries from the list of arches, labels or subarches. For example, to only download images for series trusty-release-amd64-generic, leave only this in the file:\nboot:\n  sources:\n  - keyring: /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring.gpg\n    path: http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/releases/\n    selections:\n    - arches:\n      - amd64\n      labels:\n      - release\n      release: trusty\n      subarches:\n      - generic\n  storage: /var/lib/maas/boot-resources/\n\nHope this helps!

I have my important data on Ubuntu partition. Is there any way so that I can get into my Ubuntu and take up all my data files?\n\nA: If you're just looking to grab files off of your Ubuntu filesystem from this dual booted laptop, and you only have access to Windows, there's a great little utility from DiskInternals that will allow Windows to open a Linux filesystem.\nYou can find it on this page:\nhttp://www.diskinternals.com/download/\nAnd then scroll down to find \"Linux Reader\" in the list of freeware products.\nThe utility will allow Windows read EXT-formatted partitions, and you can copy and save files from the partitions into your Windows partition.\n", "Q: JavaFX 8 not working in Ubuntu 12.04 I am using Netbeans 8.0 but in JavaFX 8(simple), and 3D applications are not running successfully.

Calls to lockf() from other processes which\n  attempt to lock the locked file section will either return an error\n  value or block until the section becomes unlocked. All the locks for a\n  process are removed when the process terminates.

As the title says, are their any themes which display text from tomboy,Xpad or gedit? or is their any file where I can edit to add text?\n\nA: conky displays whatever you have in your $HOME/.conkyrc file. You can add arbirtary text there. Alternatively, you can have it import and display the contents of another file. For example, if you have the text in question in ~/foo.txt, you can add this line to your .conkyrc:\n ${exec cat ~/foo.txt}   \n\nThat will run cat ~/foo.txt and will display the contents of the file in your conky. If the contents of the file can change and you want the changes to be updated in conky, use this instead:\n ${execi 3 cat ~/foo.txt}   \n\nThat will run cat ~/foo.txt every 3 seconds, updating the text displayed by conky. \n\nA: Conky is able to display everything you can get as standard output from any program.\nSo, I made my own command-line note manager in Python (you can download it from here).\nOnce installed, pyclinote can manage your note as simple text.\nIn order to add and delete notes you can use the gui, by launching this command from the directory you have chosen for pyclinote:\npython pyclinote.py -g\nNow, to show your notes on conky, you just have to add the following command on your conky.conf:\n${execi 2 (cd /your_path/pyclinote-1.0 && python pyclinote.py -s)}\nthis will execute every 2 seconds the 'python pyclinote.py -s' command that will return your notes list.\nIn order to make the management of notes more easy, I added a keyboard shortcut to python pyclinote.py -g, so with a simple key combo\nI can easily add or delete my notes.\nHope this will help you!\nreferences\n", "Q: Cannot format my SD card I am new to Ubuntu, using 14.04 I am trying to format an SD card to make space on it, and it's not working.

Next, make the script executable:\nchmod u+x ~/bin/update-mydebs\n\nsources.list\nAdd the line:\ndeb [trusted=yes] file:/media/Data/Ubuntu ./\n\nto your /etc/apt/sources.list, and you're done.\nUsing the Repository\nWhenever you put a new deb in the mydebs directory, run\nsudo update-mydebs\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow your local packages can be manipulated with Synaptic, aptitude and the apt commands: apt-get, apt-cache, etc. When you attempt to apt-get install, any dependencies will be resolved for you, as long as they can be met.\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal\n", "Q: Vim refuses to start with \"error while loading shared libraries: libperl.so.5.14\" after upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 After I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 vim refuses to start, showing the following error:\nvim: error while loading shared libraries: libperl.so.5.14: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nNow, I reinstalled perl, I checked /usr/lib for libperl.so.5.14 file, there are three:\nlibperl.so.5.14, libperl.so.5.14.2 and libperl.so.

I installed a program that runs in a browser. I would like to change the background picture it puts up on the screen or modify the existing one. The properties for that file tell me that it is owned by root.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 really using Linux for the 1st time.\nI am trying to make the switch from Windows and finding it laborious :-)\nHow can I change that picture file using the GUI? How do I do this with root privileges?\n\nA: Assuming you are the owner of the operating system in question then you can do something relatively simple. Also assuming the current file is owned by root and group of root then in a terminal you can:\nsudo chown your_user:root /path/to/file\n\nYou may now edit this file using your normal GUI login.\nOnce you're done, remember to set it back\nsudo chown root:root /path/to/file\n\nTo find out more about changing ownership of files see:\nman chown\n\nOpening a terminal can be as simple as opening the application bar (name?) and typing \"terminal\". Using sudo you will be asked for your password to grant you elevated privileges for making the change. See:\nman sudo\n\n\nA: Its simple, By default in ubuntu nautilus is the file manager.\nSo open the file manager with root privileges and change your file\nsudo nautilus\n\n\nA: Whenever you need to edit something as root, you can use sudo. Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal and then write this command and hit enter:\nsudo gedit /path/to/file\n\nObviously, make sure to change /path/to/file with the actual location of your file. This will open a gedit (a simple text editor) window run by root (the administrator) and will allow you to edit your file. \n\nA: I'm trying to understand which problem (use case) you actually want to solve.\nIt looks like you do not actually intend to modify your system files, but to change something in your GUI.\nIf that's right, see below. \n\nUsually, the best way to make personal changes to files that are part of Ubuntu, is to make a copy of it to your personal files, and modify that. If you can read the file owned by root, you can create a copy, which is owned by you.\nSome GUI features even do this automatically in some cases.  \nAs a simple example, if you want to make a change to an existing desktop wallpaper image,\nyou could find the file, copy it, and modify your copy.\nNow you can use it as wallpaper image.\n\n(Doing it this way has various advantages, like keeping the original, not creating conflicts when updating the package it belongs to, allowing to do the same for multiple users (and probably more).)\n", "Q: How to enable Wireshark without running as root in Trusty 14.04 I installed Wireshark.

I've tried to setup a triple screen setup (onboard monitor, HDMI and DP) and its all working nicely except that the two monitors driven by the Intel card have some horrible visual artifacts permanently flickering on the screen. \nThey do not appear when taking a screenshot so its got to be something to do with the graphics card/driver. I've gone a bit retro and taken a photo of one of the screens to illustrate it.\n\nI think I got a bit unlucky with the photo, most of the time there are way more dotted lines than that, covering the screen. They flicker around quite a lot. Interestingly while they don't appear on the nVidia-driven screen usually, if I drag a window over there then the artifacts appear around the outside of the edge of the window.\nThese visual artifacts do not appear when the nVidia card is disabled (so the intel card is not just broken). Its only when using nVidia prime to display on both sets of screens.\nAny ideas for what I can try?

I want to create a vps on Ubuntu but can not understand so please give me suggestion and tell me that can i create it by any software if yes then tell me software name.\n\nA: What is a VPS to you? Might seem like an odd question but there are numerous interpretations on what'll be best based on what you're actually doing. Here are a few examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you just want another copy of Ubuntu to play with, use desktop virtualisation software like VirtualBox or VMWare. This will also support things like Windows. These are generally the best option for graphical virtual installs.\n\n*If you want a more application-level containerisation so you can deploy multiple discrete nodes, you probably want something like lxc or Docker. This shares system resources a lot more than a \"real\" virtualisation method so there's less overhead and generally better performance, but less separation. Docker is something else to look at in this area. OpenVZ is a bit like this too.\n\n*If you want to deploy permanent and highly separated installs of various linux distributions inside Ubuntu, you can use XEN's dom0 (or kvm, or something similar) as a hypervisor.\n\n*If you just want a web server installed in your desktop version of Ubuntu, you don't need any virtualisation. All the packages that are available to Ubuntu Server are available to Ubuntu Desktop (and all its flavours). Just install and configure the applications as you would on a Server install.\n", "Q: How to make a .desktop file that matches all files and dirs?

This enables users to email eachother filepaths that are openable on Windows. When other Ubuntu users receive these filepaths I use another script to turn them back into suitable filepaths and open that up in Nautilus/Nemo/Thunar/... So Ubuntu users can right-click any file, and choose \"Copy Windows Filepath\" which will run this script. This is why it needs to be available for any MIME type.\n\nA: The Nemo file Manager has actions for a while now and you're going to be happy to hear this includes Selection=any and also Extensions=any!!!\n\nA: Try mimetype application/octet-stream for all Files. \nFound that on https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Creating_Konqueror_Service_Menus\nand using it in .desktop files for Kde Servicemenus.\n", "Q: Black screen on boot after upgrade to 14.04 I was encouraged to update to 14.04 by Ubuntu, I have done so and when I try to boot up all I get is a blank black screen.\nIf this cannot be resolved can you please send me details how to remove Ubuntu completely as I am very disappointed with what has happened.\nLuckily I still have windows on my PC and I can contact you\n\nA: When grub2 appears press 'e'.\nLocate the line with\nlinux .... ro\n\nand change it to\nlinux .... rw\n\nit worked for me.

Now I have a project to do using Visual Studio in C#. I want to know whether I can install Windows inside a Virtual Box and then install Visual Studio. Will I be able to develop Csharp application in a virtual environment? Will the Virtual Box support the running of Visual Studio software? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: yes, you can. Windows in virtualbox works very similar to how it works on a regular non virtual host. The only part that may be a bit troublesome is developing apps that use directx.\n\nA: Yes. You shouldn't have problems in developing in virtual environment. My friend uses ubuntu and virtual box to develop in Visual studio and he also uses VB to develop on OSX, i think(not sure about osx). He says that he had no problems. You may encounter problems if you're dealing with some complex graphics.\n", "Q: NVIDIA Screen Tearing problem Recently I freshly installed Xubuntu 14.04 on my low-end computer.\nEverything is working fine except that I'm experiencing screen tearing issues while I'm scrolling through a webpage. I thought I could live with it but after a while it starts to hurt my eyes.\nI have installed the Nvidia proprietary drivers version 331.38. I'm using a dual monitor setup, both are the exact same models. GPU is the ASUS GT210 1GB.\nSearched on the web a little bit and installed CompizConfig but I do not have the option to manual set the refresh rate of my monitors.\nAt this point I'm desperate and have no clue how to solve this issue, could anyone help out? Thank you very much.\n\nA: Managed to resolve my issue by using Compton. All credits go to the owner of this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2144468\nFollow the instructions there but make sure you disable the current composite manager first. \nYou can do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Xubuntu icon > Click on \"All Settings\" (bottom right corner)\n\n*In the settings menu click on \"Window Manager Tweaks\"\n\n*Click on the tab \"Compositor\"\n\n*Disable \"Display Compositing\"\n\n\nAfter disabling this, follow the instructions in the mentioned link.

You need to install what it needs. You can usually find out what it needs by running it in a command line and interpreting the errors and just installing the :i386 versions of those packages.\nIn this case...\nsudo apt-get install libqtgui4:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386\n\n...

I have completely the same problem as the guy in this question. So basically I am using nano somefile.txt editing it and then permissions denied because I forgot to use sudo. The only difference from the question is that I am using nano and therefore accepted solution does not work.\nIs there anything similar for nano?\n\nA: The simplest solution is to save the current content to a different file (best within your home directory, say ~/mytemporary-savefile), then exit nano.\nAfter that you copy the saved file over the original file with sudo cp ~/mytemporary-savefile /etc/somefile.txt \n", "Q: Where are the mouse button settings in Ubuntu 14.04? I had my Evoluent VerticalMouse set up to work using HAL FDI files in Ubuntu GNOME 13.10 and before.

Any pointers would be appreciated.\n\nA: I am having the same problem with exactly the same mouse.\nFor now I am typing \nxinput set-button-map NUM 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nin the terminal.\nTo find out the value for NUM, type\nxinput list\nThis will give you back full functionality.\nHowever, you'll have to do that after every login so it annoys a bit in the long run.\n\nA: You can use xev:\nsudo apt-get install xev\n\nOpen a terminal, and run xev from the command line. Put your mouse in the window that just opened, and click one of your mouse's buttons. You will get a lot of output for every click. Find a block that looks like this, the most important part being near the end (button 3 in this case):\nButtonPress event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x3c00001, root 0x269, subw 0x3c00002, time 14058208, (44,38), root:(1725,240), state 0x10, button 3, same_screen YES\n\nTry all your buttons and find the order you want them. Run xinput and try the result. In my case it was:\nxinput -set-button-map \"Evoluent VerticalMouse 4\" 1 3 9 4 5 6 7 8 2 10\n\nPut the xinput command in a file in your home directory. To run it at each startup, add it to the startup command list of your OS. Run a search for \"startup\" or \"startup applications\" from the home menu, you should find it easily. Just tried with Xubuntu 14.04, and it took 3 seconds to find.\nSource: https://www.evilcodingmonkey.com/2013/07/16/advanced-linux-mouse-configuration-made-easy/\n\nA: I had the same problem.  After many hours of trying to use code to make the switch from left to right permanent, I found a simple answer.  Navigate to System Settings > Mouse and Touchpad.  Open that folder and there you have it--choose your primary button to be right or left simply by checking the radio button of your choice.  That choice will stay with you until you change it.

To sum it up:\nHow do I list all the files so that I can at least start finding some begining or ending patterns to identify those for deletion\nHow do I use that pattern to delete them?\n\nA: The error you are getting is because you have too many files which means that * in your rm command is expanded to a list that is longer than the limit (ARG_MAX). So, to get around this you have various options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give rm only some of the files:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/Files/*.quo\n\n\n*Delete the directory containing the files, this avoids listing the files altogether:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/Files/\n\n\n*Use find:\nfind ~/.local/share/Trash/Files/ -delete\n\nor, for non-GNU find:\nfind ~/.local/share/Trash/Files/ -exec rm {} +\n\n\n*Use a shell loop\nfor file in  ~/.local/share/Trash/Files/*; do rm \"$file\"; done\n\n", "Q: bypass sudo for a group of commands I need to bypass sudo for a group of commands for a certain user so the command is just executed without using the sudo \n\nA: You want to allow a user to reboot without using the sudo cammand, add the command to  /etc/sudoers file : add this line to the file :\nyour-username ALL=NOPASSWD: reboot\n\nA more detailed description can be found here: How do I run specific sudo commands without a password?\n\nA: Since you want to bypass sudo, I assume you do not want to type sudo each time you execute certain commands. su will change the user session to root, making all further commands executed as root, hence no need for sudo.\ntry:\nsudo su\npaul@test-machine:~$ sudo su\n[sudo] password for paul: \nroot@test-machine:/home/paul# \nroot@test-machine:/home/paul# exit\nexit\npaul@test-machine:~$ \n\nThis command executes the change of session as root (sudo), to the root user (su root). su assumes you want to be root, so you don't need to tell it the user.\nInformation found here: http://www.linfo.org/su.html\n\nsu is usually the simplest and most convenient way to change the\n  ownership of a login session to root or to any other user. \nSyntax\nA simplified expression of the syntax of the su command is:\nsu [options] [commands] [-] [username]\n\nThe square brackets indicate that the enclosed item is optional. Thus,\n  the simplest way to use the su command is to just type:\nsu\n\nThe operating system assumes that, in the absence of a username, the\n  user wants to change to a root session, and thus the user is prompted\n  for the root password as soon as the ENTER key is pressed. This\n  produces the same result as typing:\nsu root\n\nIf the correct password is provided, ownership of the session is\n  changed to root.\n\n\nA: This is an old post but it came up first in my google search of \"command to bypass sudo\"  You should really use visudo instead of editing /etc/sudoers directly.  visudo checks to make sure you didn't enter anything wrong in the sudoers file...which could potentially break something.\nSee, e.g., Why I must use 'visudo' to edit the '/etc/sudoers' file?\nNot sure what was wrong with this post, please clarify.\n", "Q: Window snapping changes in Tweak Tool not taking effect I'm trying to change the window snapping behavior in Unity (14.04) using the Tweak Tool.

For instance, I set the bottom screen edge to \"Bottom Half\", and then drag a window to the bottom edge and nothing happens.  Closing the tweak tool, logging out and back in, and even restarting the whole computer don't help.  After making a change, if I close and then reopen the Tweak Tool, the change persists.  It's simply not reflected in the actual snapping behavior.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: I posted this on Ubuntu Forums and got a good workaround (Use CCSM instead of Tweak Tool).

Then you will be installing grub-efi, instead of grub-pc, and you will not need a 1M partition flagged with the grub-bios flag (needed bacause gpt partitioned disks do not have the room right after the Master Boot Block to store grub's core.img executable.  Secure boot shouold not need to be turned off, unless your machine has specific problems, but if you can boot Windows with it off, it should make no difference either way.\n", "Q: What is \"Feature Definition Freeze\"?

I recently upgraded to Xubuntu 14.04 on my laptop. Prior to 14.04, I used xrandr (through a script) to configure my preferred layout, which involved an external VGA monitor and the built in laptop monitor. Prior to 14.04, when I closed the lid with that layout active, the layout remained the same (ie, the built-in monitor was off, but still present in the layout).\nAfter upgrading to 14.04, my xrandr layout is retained only for as long as I don't close the lid on the laptop. After the lid is closed, the external monitor is reconfigured as the only display. After the lid is reopened, Xfce seems to restore whatever configuration I had set for the two monitors in the displays dialog prior to closing the lid. This is suboptimal for me, as I cannot make the monitors bottom-aligned through that dialog, which is why I'd prefer my xrandr layout be respected through lid closes.\nA previous question suggests looking into ACPI configuration and removing lid close scripts there, but I seem to have no scripts that do anything with the lid in /etc/acpi. I also haven't been able to find anything to do with lid closes in /etc/udev. Xfce power manager is set to do nothing with lid closes, and that setting seems to be respected – if I set it to suspend, it suspends. The \"Configure new displays when connected\" checkbox in Xfce display settings is unchecked. \n\nA: After many cycles over many weeks, today I solved the two external monitors being reconfigured incorrectly after screen unlock problem with xfce and other desktops:\nDifferent monitors have different \"start up\" or \"monitor boot\" latency - in the order of a second, perhaps more with monitors I don't have.\nThis latency means that even using a keyboard combo to run own xrandr config (perhaps embedded in a script file), has often failed.\nTried using xrandr to first disable all outputs, then wait say 3 seconds. This did not work - it's the monitors \"turning on\" where this problem lies and my old (~7 years?) Intel i7-2640M with inbuilt \"Intel HD Graphics 3000\", presumably fails to maintain the desired display port output config for long enough for at least one of my (4K) external monitors to start up.\nSOLUTION: run xrandr in 2 steps - first enable one external monitor only, then sleep 1s (I've tried 0.6s, but that was insufficient), then enable both monitors, e.g. like so (vary to suit your monitors of course):\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off --output DP1 --mode \"3840x1080\" --pos \"0x580\" --rate 60 --output DP2 --off                                                                                              \nsleep 1s\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off --output DP1 --mode \"3840x1080\" --pos \"0x580\" --rate 60 --output DP2 --mode \"3840x2160\" --pos \"3840x0\"\n\nAttach such a sequence (in a script) to your chosen keyboard shortcut, then after unlocking the screen (XFCE, KDE, whatever), use the shortcut to run this script.\nApparently same issue here (posted same answer there):\nhttps://forum.xfce.org/viewtopic.php?pid=54610#p54610\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 : My computer sees the wireless network, but won't connect to it, keeps asking for the WPA password Sony Vaio VGN-NW240F\nNetwork controller: Qualcomm Atheros AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) (rev 01)\n$ lspci -vv -s\nSubsystem: Foxconn International, Inc.

I'm gonna say driver (?!) ... and followed the instructions. It was only through the github link that I could actually work out where the ... I'm gonna say driver (?!) ... was and downloaded it on my laptop, unzipped it and copied it over on a USB stick. Then I just did the make commands etc. Boom! it worked :)\nAnd I also had to use this command sometimes to clear a cache or whatever:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nA: So, my issue was fixed. I'm not extremely sure how, but here is what I did:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nMaybe that will help others who have this problem, if that was the solution of course.\n\nA: If anyone else is having the same problem as me where you have to run sudo service network-manager restart every time you login for your wifi to work. I have found a permanent fix for my network adapter that the newer release of ubuntu broke. Ignore my previous comments about downgrading the kernel as the main problem was the new wpasupplicant package in 14.04.\nMy solution involved getting this ppa: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/mathieu-tl/nm/ubuntu saucy main it has Ubuntu's 13.10 network manager package and wpasupplicant package. I went to synaptic and downgraded only the wpasupplicant package. I never have to run the command sudo service network-manager restart again.\n\nA: I got the same problem when I was on my home network and switching between a wired and wireless connection. After working fine for a couple of days, the wireless was suddenly no longer working. I could see the wireless network, but when trying to connect it continuously asked for a password.\nI fixed it by installing the new driver for my network card and switching my router off and on. \nI hope this helps anyone with similar issues! \n\nA: This is not a solution rather a workaround, you can use nmcli command line interface for the network manager. For example:\nnmcli d wifi connect <Your-SSID> password <Your-Password>\n\nLet me know if you are able to connect with this.\n\nA: I installed \"wifi radar\" form softwere center Started it left everything as it was and hit save and exited it.

Only the configuration with the middle button does not work, do you have any solution?  \nBelow is my synclient's configuration:\nLeftEdge                = 1769\nRightEdge               = 5423\nTopEdge                 = 1644\nBottomEdge              = 4544\nFingerLow               = 25\nFingerHigh              = 30\nMaxTapTime              = 180\nMaxTapMove              = 238\nMaxDoubleTapTime        = 180\nSingleTapTimeout        = 180\nClickTime               = 100\nEmulateMidButtonTime    = 75\nEmulateTwoFingerMinZ    = 282\nEmulateTwoFingerMinW    = 7\nVertScrollDelta         = 108\nHorizScrollDelta        = 108\nVertEdgeScroll          = 0\nHorizEdgeScroll         = 0\nCornerCoasting          = 0\nVertTwoFingerScroll     = 1\nHorizTwoFingerScroll    = 1\nMinSpeed                = 1\nMaxSpeed                = 1.75\nAccelFactor             = 0.03688\nUpDownScrolling         = 0\nLeftRightScrolling      = 1\nUpDownScrollRepeat      = 1\nLeftRightScrollRepeat   = 1\nScrollButtonRepeat      = 100\nTouchpadOff             = 2\nLockedDrags             = 0\nLockedDragTimeout       = 5000\nRTCornerButton          = 0\nRBCornerButton          = 0\nLTCornerButton          = 0\nLBCornerButton          = 0\nTapButton1              = 1\nTapButton2              = 2\nTapButton3              = 3\nClickFinger1            = 1\nClickFinger2            = 1\nClickFinger3            = 0\nCircularScrolling       = 0\nCircScrollDelta         = 0.1\nCircScrollTrigger       = 0\nCircularPad             = 0\nPalmDetect              = 0\nPalmMinWidth            = 10\nPalmMinZ                = 200\nCoastingSpeed           = 20\nCoastingFriction        = 50\nPressureMotionMinZ      = 30\nPressureMotionMaxZ      = 160\nPressureMotionMinFactor = 1\nPressureMotionMaxFactor = 1\nResolutionDetect        = 1\nGrabEventDevice         = 1\nTapAndDragGesture       = 1\nAreaLeftEdge            = 0\nAreaRightEdge           = 0\nAreaTopEdge             = 0\nAreaBottomEdge          = 0\nHorizHysteresis         = 27\nVertHysteresis          = 27\nClickPad                = 0\n\n\nA: I solved it. Due to fact that it is not the first problem with my touchpad I previously changed the button-map to avoid the issue with left physical button that acted like left and middle button simultaneously, so I typed:\nxinput set-button-map \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" 1 0 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nSo in fact i couldn't use the middle button in TapButton2 option. So I decided to replace ExtBt7 with middle button using the command:\nxinput set-button-map \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" 1 0 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 12\n\nand after that I set the TapButton2 to new value.\nsynclient TapButton2=11\n\nAnd voila! Everything works like it should. Tap with one finger is raported as a left click, with two fingers as a middle click.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Intel 7260 AC Wireless driver does not work properly I have dell xps 13 developer edition with ubuntu 14.04.

So I'm pretty new to Ubuntu. I'm experiencing overheating problem with my laptop and sometimes it's turned off suddenly. I have a Toshiba L655 laptop with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - 64bit. I installed lm-sensors package and measured the temperature. It is continuously increasing when I'm working (just web browsing ) I googled my problem and found few solutions given in some forums. To solve this first I installed proprietary video driver from \"Software & Updates\" -> \"Additional Drivers\" tab.(VGA = AMD/ATI - Mobility Radeon HD 5430/5450/5470) Yet it didn't make any improvement. \nThen I edited  /etc/default/grub and set\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi.power_nocheck=1\"\n\nand saved (found from a forum). After that I executed this command \nsudo update-grub\n\nand rebooted. Still no sign of an improvement. Then I installed another package\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\nsudo tlp start\n\nNothing changed. \nMay be the problem is with my cooling fan , when I was using Windows the cooling fan functioned frequently and I didn't have any issue like this. Now with Ubuntu 14.04 cooling fan is almost not operating. Very rarely it comes and goes and at that time I observe the temperature goes down. I really appreciate if anyone can help me to solve this problem.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 uses kernel 3.13 and since 3.13 there is a major bug in controlling the fans!\nI saw reports about affected HP and DELL laptops, and even Macbook Air. The symptom on my HP Compaq nx8220 is that the fan speed is set according to the temperature, but only once at boot time or when resumed after suspend! At boot time the temp is usually medium and the fan stays at medium speed. But after resume the temp is low, the fan stays off and the system overheats easily.\nI was able to fix it today (July 13 2014) with a pre-release of kernel 3.13.0-32 from https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nCareful users should wait a few days to get this fixed kernel as a normal update!\nFrom what I have read the problem was a kernel patch called \"ACPI / AC: convert ACPI ac driver to platform bus\" which has now been reverted in kernel 3.13.0-31 and higher.\n", "Q: How do I access the command prompt in Lubuntu?

I'm very new and I literally don't know anything, any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!\nUpdate: I'm not looking for a keyboard shortcut, by button I meant a gtk-button inside glade. How to I set it so that when clicked it would take me to the application \"hardinfo\". If this isn't possible, then how can I set the button to emulate a keyboard shortcut once clicked, inside glade, Thankssssss!\nUpdate 2: What I'm looking for is a step by step process of how to do this from someone who knows glade and quickly completely, because I have no idea how the codes work and where I'm supposed to put them :/\n\nA: Had to boot up Ubuntu in a VM for this one, I don't use Unity ;)\nYou can set up custom keybinds by opening the launcher (top left-hand button) and going to \"Keyboard.\" From there you can go to the \"Shortcuts\" tab and create a custom shortcut. Name it whatever you wish, but make the command \"hardinfo\" (no quotes). After that's completed, click the right-hand side of the line that was just added to set your keystroke.\n\nA: You want something like this. I can't do this in Python, only in Perl, but it will look similar in Python.\nsub startapp {\n    system \"/usr/bin/name_of_application &\";\n}\n\n$button = Gtk2::Button->new(\"Start application\");\n$button->signal_connect(clicked => \\&startapp, $window);\n$button->show;\n\n\nA: OK, how about a clear and concise (working) example:\n\n\n*\n\n*quickly create ubuntu-application test\n\n*cd test\n\n*quickly design\n\n*Add a button somewhere with Glade (by default it is called \"button1\")\n\n*Save and close Glade\n\n*quickly edit and go to TestWindow.py\n\n*Add the following at the top of the file:\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\nimport subprocess\n\n\n*Add the following to the end of the file and make sure it is indented properly (pro tip: select the block of text in Gedit and hit tab to indent the whole block):\ndef on_button1_clicked(self, widget, data=None):\n    p = Process(target=self.launch_hardinfo)\n    p.start()\n\ndef launch_hardinfo(self):\n    subprocess.call([\"hardinfo\"])\n\nThese two functions work together. Process.start() calls TestWindow.launch_hardinfo (that's the target= parameter to the Process constructor) in a new thread so that subprocess.call() doesn't block the application.\n\n*Save TestWindow.py\n\n*quickly run and and click the button.\n\n\nI had a little issue because I was trying to assign signals in Glade, but you don't even need to do that. The Quickly library actually allows you to do stuff like on_button1_click() which means \"when the control called button1 is clicked.\" Simple as that! Hopefully this should get you started.\nSee also: Creating Ubuntu Application with Quickly\n", "Q: Why doesn't GNOME 3.10 work in Ubuntu 14.04 I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 and want to have GNOME working instead of Unity, I simply typed to console:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell -y\n\nSome required packages were installed and gdm was along them.\nI made gdm be the default against lightdm.\nHowever, when I log in I can't really pick GNOME as desktop enviroment at start login screen.

The system wouldn't come up any more, sometimes it would get farther into the startup then other times.\nE.

Since I just installed Ubuntu, the loss of data was negligable.\nTo put it in a nutshell: The installation did not even get close to the point where anything would be installed. Either it did not reach the start of any user interface at all or it hung up on me during one of the (early) steps.\nSo I tried booting from DVD and have the \"try Ubuntu\" option to check the hardware from there, but that would not work either. (Same results: Startups hanging in various stages).\nMeanwhile I kept googling for similar problems and hopefully their solutions but to no avail so far. I just can't think of any reason that a system that would install fine one day could not be booted from another medium the other.\nDuring Install as well as boot from medium I tried using the boot option \"noplymouth\" instead of \"quiet splash\". The messages shown until the start of xserver showed no errors, or at least none that I could see.\nAlso in all cases I tried switching to some terminal using \"CTRL+ALT+F1\" but that wouldn't work either.\nI am quite new to running Ubuntu, so yes, the task of using Ubuntu as sole OS on a new laptop might be a wee bit over my head.\nI hope some of you have an idea of what might be wrong or at which part of my setup I might need to look.

I ran some system checks I found on the system (which was not much, but then again, I am new with Ubuntu).\nAfter playing around with it a bit I thought to try the much feared reboot and behold, it hung again. So I tried installing again now using bootoption \"nomodeset\" and I finally managed to get into the installation.\nIn some forum someone suggested to first get a clean install from USB/DVD without any updates whatsoever which worked as well.\nI tried rebooting the system and it hung up on me again (during shutdown).\nSo, I tried changing the Nvidia driver to the proprietary, tested one and adding NOMODESET to the grub.\nTried rebooting ... and it hung up on me again (during shutdown). This time even the magic sysrq B does not work \nSomehow I managed to get the system into a state, in which it would reboot, if that reboot was triggered from one of the Terminals (cTRL+ALT+F2 in my case). The login to Unity however does not work anymore, but leaves me in a state that has been thoroughly discussed here:\nUnity doesn't load no launcher no dash appearsUnity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears\nThe proposed answers did not  my cause at all so I think something might be very much broken either with the software or hardware on my machine. I am not going to give up just yet.\nAfter another round of reinstallation I installed a basic system with only English language support (previously German).

How i do this?\nThank you!\n\nA: It seems like something in the nvidia and mesa upgrades is conflicting with cuda.\nYou can do a simple apt-get upgrade, which should not ask to remove anything, only do what upgrades can be done without removing anything.\nTo investigate why cuda is being removed, you can try upgrading the remaining packages (after apt-get upgrade) one at a time and see which one is removing cuda. You can use synaptic to graphically do this, or simply do apt-get install <package> to upgrade a single package (install will upgrade packages if possible).\nIt's possible that you can just proceed with removing it and then reinstall it after the upgrade, but it's better to know ahead of time what packages are conflicting.\nYou can get CUDA here if needed.\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads\n", "Q: How can I upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04? I want to Upgrade my Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04.\n\nA: Switch on your computer with Ubuntu 12.04, (presumably 12.04.4 if you have updated all till now), and logon. \nDo not open any application. Open 'Software Updater' from Dash. It would check for updates and upgrades. \nFollow all the instruction from it. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, you may have to wait for some time. \nI upgraded to 14.04 LTS this way, and hope it works for you as well. Wonder of wonders! It is a seamless operation.

I loaded AMD's FGLRX drivers and Catalyst manager using a script downloaded from their site  thusly:  made myself root, then  \"sh amd-install-correct-fglrx.run\" in the recovery mode command line after making / rw and purging as best I could all of the old fglrx stuff.  I did have to use --force to make it work because there was some residual fglrx thing somewhere which survived all the purging.\nIt works, supports netflix and hdmi sound, and is wonderful in every way until the update manager decides to overwrite it with the vanilla fglrx.\nThe setup installed as above does not appear as a package and apparently cannot be locked in synaptic package manager.  I suppose I'm asking how to block an update of a package which doesn't reside as such on my machine.\nI realize that questions like this have been asked repeatedly but the answers always seem to be aimed at preventing an update of an installed package, not the overwriting of an installation done without a package.\nMaybe the best idea would be to figure out what the package would be named if I had it installed and block any updates to that?\n\nA: You likely are looking to blacklist the installation (and/or update) of a package. Instead of looking to blacklist the package you have manually installed, you want to blacklist the overwriting vanilla package (which would be the package named fglrx or fglrx-*, or similar).\nThis other askubuntu answer outlines how to go about blacklisting a package, which you will want to do to whichever the vanilla fglrx package name is - Blacklisting packages from installing\n", "Q: Flash drive installation Does Ubuntu install itself on my computer's hard drive using the USB as a loading device or does the OS run off the drive itself (only working when plugged in)?\n\nA: You have to load the Ubuntu ISO on the usb using a software called \"Unetbootin\", oherwise there's no way it loads itself for installation, other than burning the ISO on a DVD \nNOTE: I'm not sure this will work with Ubuntu 14.04!, it depends on Unetbootin being updated or not\n\nA: Normally when you are booting from Ubuntu for the first time (where you have not installed it yet - you would have selected hard drives to install on or the like) you will be running from the USB. This is called a Live Boot and it is only running off the USB and has not been installed onto the hard drive yet. If you click a Install Ubuntu which is typically located on the desktop it will then install Ubuntu from the USB on to the computer's hard drive.\nAs ed0 has said, there are several tools to load the Ubuntu ISO onto usb drives, some being Unetbootin, Pen Drive Linux, and various others you can find by searching.\n\nA: When you use a liveCD (on USB or CD), the OS loads into memory (RAM). \nThe process is (simply) like this. You set up your BIOS/UEFI to boot from USB. The USB must have the ability to boot (to make it bootable you can use a program like Unetbootin), usually the bootloader is GRUB or another bootloader. Once this is recognized (as the OS/bootloader) the OS will take over, and run its commands in memory (RAM). With a liveCD it is not writing onto your hard disk necessarily, unless you set it up that way.(Search for swap partition/files if you want to know more about that).\nI hope that was simple enough, and I didn't make too many mistakes with simplifying the process.\nEDIT: So you should be able to unplug the stick once the OS is loaded (unless the OS is using the USB for swapping memory to the physical disk, which I am only assuming it does not)  \nAccording to this answer : \nDoes Ubuntu run from a CD/DVD save data ONLY in memory?\nA virtual RAMdisk (substituting for a Harddisk) is loaded into RAM in place of the hard drive.\n", "Q: How to wipe clean an NTFS hard drive, with a hibernated Windows I tried to wipe clean my NTFS Windows hard drive, to complete my transfer to Ubuntu.

To format it, find it in the Disks utility, select it, click on the gears icon, and select Format.  Then follow the prompts.\nYou can also format it using the filesystem of your choice from the Terminal with mkfs.<fstype>.

I follow the man yes also I try that but I want to know when we need to use this command. You can follow man page to know the usage of yes. But I am looking for a time when we need that? In which situation I need example.\n\nA: The Wikipedia article has a good explanation.\nBasically it spams a \"yes\" to wherever it is run. This can be used to automate responses to programs that ask for user verification. As an example, the following:\nrm -f *.txt\n\nis functionally equivalent to\nyes | rm *.txt\n\nIt pipes the \"yes\" to rm, so to any question that rm asks (write protection or similar), it will immediately get a \"yes\" and continue.\nCommon programs like apt or rm have a \"force\" function built in, but other programs may not. This is where yes can be useful.\nIt can also be used as input to create a certain size of file, or to stress test a system.\n\nA: \"yes\" was created to allow automation of tasks that request confirmation. If you have a program that wants you to tell it \"y\" before it does something, you can now automate that program by piping yes into it.\nExample :\nyes | rm -i *.txt\n\nHere yes is piped for confirmation to delete all txt files in the directory .\nAnother option print a string repeatedly :\nyes \"test\"\n\nStop by Ctrl + C\nIt also can be used to say no , this repeat n after the rm :\nyes n | rm -i *.txt\n\nThe above example says not to remove a file when rm -i prompts to remove the file.\n", "Q: useradd: cannot lock /etc/subuid; try again later So, while trying to upgrade to 14.04 I encountered this error:\nCould not calculate the upgrade\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.\n\nPlease report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message: 'E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.'\n\nI looked into it and opened the /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log log file in a text editor, locating any \"broken\" packages and remove them with sudo apt-get remove . I had 33 broken packages.\nI typed \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\" to see if there were any packages: there were 2 packages which didn't want to update: libboost-filesystem-dev and libboost-thread-dev, so i removed them to see if I was able to get a correct upgrade. \nIt didn't work.\nI'm now getting an error about unresolved dependencies and can't do anything.

(You can see that in the response says 'existing lock file /etc/subgid.lock', so you have to remove all files that is put in the response). Do this: $ sudo mv subgid.lock /home/youruser/subuid.lock.sav. Substituting subgid.lock for your error file.\n4- Try again $ sudo useradd nickname. If shows other error file, remove it. If no more error files are there, you should get now the new user.\nThis was very useful for me, so I hope that you can fix the problem =). And sorry for my english because I'm spanish.

He said that the nexus 7, just as the 10 started out with an unlocked OS but about 6 months before a new release they also became locked. This leads him to believe that there is a new release of Android coming up soon and that is why the nexus 10 is now shipping with a locked OS. I personally am not too concerned with the Android OS being not upgradable. What does concern me is whether or not I will be able to install other OSs such as Ubuntu onto this tablet. Does anyone know if this 'lock' will affect my ability to install Ubuntu?\n\nA: In order to install any other ROM or OS on an Android Tablet/Phone you need to first unlock the bootloader.\nUnlocking the bootloader is very easy on Nexus devices.  It's sometimes easy and sometimes difficult on devices by other brands such as HTC, Samsung.  This is why Nexus devices are often popular with developers and those interested in aftermarket ROMs or Ubuntu Touch itself.\nTo reiterate, unlocking Nexus devices is easy.  \nOnce you have the Android SDK, it's a matter of \nadb reboot bootloader\nfastboot oem unlock\n\nThe information given to you regarding Nexus 10s being 'locked' seems ambiguous.  It seems they are referring to the upgrade cycle.  However, most devices should get upgrades for roughly 18 months. That is not a lock, but is simply an upgrade cycle and should not concern you regarding your ability to install Ubuntu.\n\nA: As far as I know you have to root your system to install any new operating system and rooting the system overrides any lock that could be there. The \"lock\" most probably means that there will be no pushed major automatic updates.\nI think that you should have no problems installing Ubuntu because of the \"lock\".\n", "Q: corrupted sudoers file, Ubuntu 12.04 My /etc/sudoers file is somehow corrupted and all the users who have sudo privileges are unable to execute ANY command with sudo prefix to the command !\nsudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers.d/README near line 1\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\nsudo: unable to initialize policy plugin\n\nI have tried almost all the solutions suggested in previous similar questions like\n\n\n*\n\n*rebooted the system many times\n\n*Tried to modify the file /etc/sudoers.d/README but was unable to do so.\n\n*In recovery mode, mounted the file system with rw and tried to modify the mentioned file but was unsuccessful\n\n*pkexec bash..... still no use\n\n\nThe file line in /etc/sudoers.d/README is infact an empty line.\nCan you please guide me !\nThanks.\n\nA: I've found that all lines in the sudoers README have to be prefixed with a #.\nI don't understand why README is being processed when you run sudo, but uncommented lines seem to break it. I only stumbled on this when an SD card in my raspberry pi started to fail and corrupted a number of files. This is despite the README file not being the only file in the folder.\n\nA: On my Ubuntu-based system (Mint) /etc/sudoers.d/README is all comments, like # ... there is no line that isn't a comment. And other files in /etc/sudoers.d/ contain blank lines with no errors from sudo... is it possible your blank line contains some weird non-printable character? A hex editor should show anything weird in it.\nAnd since the README file is all comments it shouldn't be necessary for sudo to work anyway, except for this comment in it:\n# Note that there must be at least one file in the sudoers.d directory (this\n# one will do), and all files in this directory should be mode 0440.\n\nSo as long as there's another file in that directory, you could try  moving your corrupt README file out of the dir and see if that helps.\nAnd you should have been able to modify the file in a recovery mode in your attempt 3, I'm assuming you would have been given permission to modify any file, like booting from a live cd/dvd/usb, if you couldn't edit the file maybe the file &/or filesystem itself is corrupt, tried a fsck ?\nAnd here's another well-liked (upvoted) guide on how to fix a corrupt sudoers file, if it doesn't work then I'd look into the fsck/corrupt filesystem possibility.\n\nA: I ran into a similar problem, but it was my own actions that caused the problem. I was already using a file \n/etc/sudoers.d/randy-sudoers\n\nfor my personal changes, as I was instructed to do.\nI thought I was being smart to create a subdirectory off of my home, and create a randy-sudoers file there with me as owner and rw permissions. I could edit this file with mousepad (Xubuntu) as I pleased. Then I wrote a script to copy this file to /etc/sudoers.d.randy-sudoers and change the owner, group, and permissions as needed. This is discussed in this link and is marked as a good idea, but let me tell you, it is a BAD IDEA. https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1352310&highlight=visudo+busy\nThe problem is that I made a mistake in the file. Once I copied it down to /etc/sudoers.d/randy-sudoers, all of a sudden my sudo commands didn't work anymore. It told me there was an error on line 20 of my file. I could modify that in my home subdirectory, but I couldn't use sudo to copy it down to /etc/sudoers again. All my attempts to use sudo were blocked, which I needed to do the copy.\nHunting around, I found what I needed to do was run this:\npkexec visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/randy-sudoers\n\nThis allowed me to bypass the sudo command and edit the file and remove/correct the offending line, and then save again. It prompted me to save as \n/etc/sudoers.d/randy-sudoers.tmp\n\nwhich I did. It then checked the validity of the tmp file and overwrote the original offending file. Whew! I was saved.\n", "Q: Can someone please clear up the haziness regarding security in Ubuntu and the other recognised distros? I was using Ubuntu, but after updating to 14.04 LTS the Unity Desktop did not perform particularly well. So after research, I switched to Xubuntu, a recognised version of Ubuntu running the Xfce desktop environment.\nDo both of these distros actually have anti-virus and anti-malware etc. built in, plus the programmable firewall, or are they just so called 'resistant' to viruses, because of supposed lack of Ubuntu specific viruses. \nI have looked through many articles on Ask Ubuntu as well as other blogs, and all they seem to do is contradict.\nPlease help! Any help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Does Ubuntu have antivirus pre-installed? \nNo, and there are very few antivirus tools available for Linux distros most of which only scan for Windows viruses. The only security tool I'm aware of that supports scanning for Linux viruses is Eset Node32 Antivirus For Linux. That all said there are very few known viruses for Linux. \nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*OSX didn't used to get viruses either.\n\n*Just because viral code (eg a Windows virus) can't infect your system doesn't mean you want it stored on your hard drive, especially if you share files with friends/family, or dual boot with Windows.\nHow does Ubuntu defend itself From Viruses And Hackers?\nUbuntu relies on security updates, and permissions to protect itself. For example the important system files are owned by root to prevent anyone from changing them which is why you have to use sudo so often. \nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows uses the same approach of permissions, but it often fails because people use Administrative accounts rather than user accounts. My point being that permissions on any operating system only work if the user demonstrates good practice. This means not giving root priviledges without thinking first, and never installing programs from sources you don't trust. The system isn't exposed unless a user exposes it.\n\n\nDoes Ubuntu have a firewall pre-installed?\nYes, IPTABLES partnered with UFW, but it doesn't come with any pre-setup rules so you're not protected.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a good idea to disconnect from the network you get your internet from when you're not using it.\n\n\n\nIn summary an Ubuntu installation is as protected as a Windows installation, and the first thing you'd do on Windows is install a better firewall and antivirus, but on Ubuntu there aren't any comparable tools so you're hooped. Luckily Ubuntu is less targeted.\n\nA: The 'contradiction' stems from individual opinion.\nSince security, like nirvana, is a state that is not reachable with any combination of operating system and application on earth, individuals pick their security comfort zone individually. Hence the apparent contradiction.\nPeople in the Linux department mostly think that viruses is something that happens to Windows only and applying antiviral measures to Linux itself would be pointless. Given the net effectiveness of viral protection that happens at the Windows camp, some even forward the opinion that the entire business model is shoddy, scare-ware or a scam in itself. \nPlease read the many articles you refer to and form your own opinion.\nNo, neither ubuntu nor xubuntu come with anti-virus or a firewall pre-installed. The makers believe that the system is as secure as it gets.\n\nA: To my knowledge no linux distributions including the Ubuntu family have Anti-Virus/Anti-Maul-ware software \"built in\". Ubuntu indeed has a firewall called IPtables installed but by default it's deactivated and many distributions do not come with a GUI to activate or configure it \"built in\". That is not to say either can not be installed.\nLinux and desktop distributions of Ubuntu in particular are more \"Resistant\" to viruses due to the fact that the market share though growing is significantly smaller and the structure of Unix and Unix derived OSes (Linux, BSD, MacOS, ETC) make it harder to infect and gain system level access where they can do the most damage and propagate fastest. Web facing programs seem to be the overall soft spots, however the vast majority of these weaknesses seem to be in social engineering (Fooling you into doing or allowing something that is malicious.) and thus practically undetectable to any software currently known. Likewise linux does not open unneeded ports to the internet unlike Windows, so having a firewall for most cases is not deeded as the ports that are not in use are typically closed and locked to outside connections.\nAll this being said, the following pages will supply some good reading.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/security: Some basic\ninformation on Ubuntu Security in easy to follow Q and A format.\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus: Official Documentation on Antivirus software.\n\n", "Q: My wi-fi auto connect after very long time (about 5 minutes) Every time I start my computer I have to press twice F12 in order to deactivate and reactivate WI FI, and just after that my connection starts (in a few seconds).

Otherwise, the DVD will not work!!\nWait, until the burning-process is completely finished!\nThen put this new DVD into the drive of the machine, you want to install Ubuntu 14.04 on.\nThen in the installer, you get two options:\neither: installing alongside Windows (Windows will be preserved and will be the first booting-option\nor: wipe Windows Vista off your harddrive and install Ubuntu instead.\nSo you see: you did a burning-mistake!! Your mistake was, that you extracted the files from the iso-image! This is wrong!! You need to do it as stated above.\nGreetings\nAndrea\n\nA: If you install Ubuntu using the \"Whole Disk\" option, it will remove all previous files and it will be clean.\nSo when you booted to the live disk and told it to install, did you follow all the instructions to the end? The install can take 30 minutes or so. Did it take that long?\n", "Q: Is there an Ubuntu shortcut for moving the cursor to the next word I want something similar to Windows' Ctrl+Left/Right arrow key.\nThe effect is that the cursor moves to the beginning of the previous/next word. \nI did not find anything on the Ubuntu documentation. \nAny help?\n\nA: In most GUI programs, Ctrl + Left/Right will work as expected. In the terminal, the defaults are different. You can use Alt + F and Alt + B or you can set up your terminal to use Ctrl + Left/Right as well.\nTo do so, add these lines to your ~/.inputrc file (create the file if it does not exist):\n\"\\e[1;5D\": backward-word ## good: Ctrl+left\n\"\\eOd\": backward-word\n\"\\e[1;5C\": forward-word\n\"\\eOc\": forward-word\n\nThen, open a new terminal and the Ctrl + Left/Right  shortcuts should work. For more info on the strange syntax used, see my answer here.\nNote, however, that this should be enabled by default on Ubuntu, at least it is on my 14.04 install.\n", "Q: Can't execute files in windows partitions from Ubuntu I am using Ubuntu 14.04 inside Windows.

I have an old laptop with sadly out of date 10.04 Lucid on it.  The internal drive is partitioned and contains Windows 7, which I never use.  Gradually, it's losing functionality, as more software becomes incompatible with it.\nI recently bought an external drive to backup all my data on.

Perhaps on a separate partition?\n\nA: The answer to your question is a clear \"NO\".\nYou should never ever use the same external drive for data-backup and as booting-device.\nFor this purpose, i really recommend, to use two different media.\nFor data-backup, I would recommend, that you use your existing external harddrive.\nAs boot-device, you can either use a fresh and clean DVD (which you burnt the iso-image on) or otherwise - as I do it - a usb-stick.

The only issue that seems to persist is a bit of a (very soft) scratching sound coming from my HDD. I checked my drive manager and it appears to have a high read error rate. Is this a major issue? The software said any value other than 0 \"indicates a problem with the disk or the read/write heads.\"\nHere's a quick screenie for reference: \nThanks for any help!\n\nA: The raw value for the read rate is meaningless, and basically all drives show really big numbers there.  The normalized value of 118 with a threadhold value of 6 indicates that it is a LONG way from being a problem indicator ( it has to get from 118 down to 6, and the worst it has ever been is 99 ).

I need to get back to my windows how do I do this?!\n\nA: The standard solution to problems like this is to run boot-repair:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nYou can run this from within Ubuntu, or there's also a CD image available from the above linked site.\nBoot-repair is capable of fixing problems with Windows boot, not just Ubuntu, and should even work for dual-boot systems.\nAs for the reason for your problem, it's most likely that the Ubuntu installer modified your computer's boot information in UEFI in a way that is not compatible with the way you were booting before.  This is bad news for your Windows partition as it has lost the ability to boot.  It is possible that you could solve that problem with the Windows repair CD, but you would then still not be able to boot Ubuntu, and in some cases it may require a re-install of Windows which is not ideal.

You need to installation file, SketchUp.exe\nwine /home/your_user/SketchUp.exe\n\nNot sure if after you install SketchUp will be in your menu (it might) under the wine glass symbol or SketchUp, or if not wine /path/to/installedSketchUp , usually in ~/.wine in the c_drive.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine \n\nA: I'd look in the Ubuntu Software Center or Synaptic to see if you installed the WINE packages correctly. They're available from the regular Ubuntu sources/repositories, and when I installed them they always added WINE menu items to the \"start menu\". I'm not sure if you're using Unity or MATE or XFCE or K, but there should be some graphic way to look through your program shortcuts.\nIf the guide you followed involved downloading mystery files from mystery websites to install wine, that's not the usual linux/Ubuntu way to install programs.

If so, will doing so automatically replace Windows as my OS? I'm downloading it using someone else's computer and I don't want to accidentally download Ubuntu onto their computer. Basically what I'm asking is will downloading Ubuntu on a DVD only burn it onto the disc or will it replace Windows as the computer's operating system? Another question; is a 4.7gb disc going to be enough space for the operating system?\n\nA: Sounds like we need to clarify some concepts for you.\nBy default, \"downloading Ubuntu\" using a Windows computer will not automatically replace Windows OS. What you will be doing is downloading a file (a large one at about 4GB) that can be burned onto a blank DVD disc. This DVD can then be used to install Ubuntu onto any computer that 1) supports booting from a DVD disc, and 2) supports the version of Ubuntu you download. BUT, you have to put the DVD in that computer AND boot from it AND tell Ubuntu to install AND tell it to replace Windows.\nSo in short: No, if you just download the latest Ubuntu Desktop file, it will not replace Windows on your friends computer.\nGood luck, and be sure to check out the Ubuntu community documentation.

However it is very weird that after it boots Ubuntu the arrows keys work perfectly.\nHelp!!!\n\nA: Does your BIOS/UEFI setup have a setting for \"legacy USB support\" or \"USB keyboard support\"?  If so, enabling this might allow your keyboard to work during boot.\nThese USB support options allow USB based keyboards to function as if they are traditional DIN or PS/2 keyboards like in the days before USB.  This will only affect the time up until your operating system loads its own keyboard drivers, so it can allow USB keyboards to work during boot even for boot loaders without USB support.\nI'm not sure if Grub should support USB keyboards without the legacy option.  But in this case it's worth a try.\n\nA: *\n\n*Before Grub loads, (on my machine at least) when given the option to enter BIOS or select boot volume, I hit a key to go to one of those and then hit escape. \n\n*When it dumps me out at grub I now can move the arrows up and down. Whereas if I just let it load to Grub, keyboard does not work.\n\n\nA: I had exactly this problem and I thought I would never get back into Windows.

Indeed, I couldn't navigate through my BIOS. I had to finded an old PS/2 keyboard. Fortunately my motherboard have a PS/2 connector and I manually configured the USB support in the bios.\nAfter that I never faced this problem anymore.\nTo return to your problem, can you navigate through your bios ? The problem is only concerning grub ? Your keyboard have some lighting indicator during your boot ?\nIf you can't navigate in your bios, please try this solutions :\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the USB port of your keyboard to another one\n\n*Try another keyboard\n\n*Use a PS/2 keyboard (if possible) and then enable the USB support in your bios.\n\n\nA: I had this problem too but it turns out that special characters such as '@' as in P@ssword was not being generated. At the prompt pressing RIGHT SHIFT and key 2 does not generate a '@' instead a '2' is generated. This can be confirmed by switching over to another TTY and typing in the password (CTRL + ALT + F1) which will echo the key press. In this TTY, I noted that using LEFT SHIFT and key 2 generated the '@' control character. Thus if LEFT SHIFT is used in complex password it will be typed correctly and cryptsetup will be able to decrypt the volume. It is very frustrating when grub can not accept complex password characters used on encrypted volumes during recovery booting. \n\nA: I had the same exact problem with the grub menu and found a fix that worked for me. I tried looking into BIOS, and I tried 'Page Up/Page Down' keys- both with no success.. Finally I plugged in a different USB keyboard and the Up/Down keys were working normally with the menu.\nThe keyboard that didn't work was older, and the one that was working was newer.. Not really sure why one would work and the other wouldn't though. \nHopefully this helps!\n\nA: I installed Ubuntu 18.04 LTS alongside Windows 10.

We installed a Nagios plugin that brought along build-essential, and I'd like to remove it because I don't want build tools on a production server.\nWhen I simulate the apt-get remove command:\napt-get remove build-essential --simulate\n\nIt says it will also remove the Nagios plugin.  \nHow can I remove build-essential while keeping the plugin?\n\nA: The \"nagios plugin\" you installed probably lists build-essential as a dependency.\nThe most common reason a package would list build-essential as a dependency is if that package compiles some source code as part of its installation procedure.  Depending on build-essential is not common practice for packages provided by Ubuntu itself, which on the rare occasions they do require some compilation during install, would not include all of build-essential.\nAssuming it's listed as a \"requires\" dependency there is no way to remove the dependency but leave the package that depends on it using APT. This is a constraint that is enforced by APT for the entire time the package is installed.\nIn theory if the build tools were only required when the package was installed but are no longer being used, you could forcibly remove the various files belonging to build-essential and things would probably continue to work.  But this is definitely not recommended as it will leave you with a system that, as far as APT/dpkg are concerned, is broken!\nYou say that you don't want build tools on a production server.  Is this for security reasons?  Because if so, simply not having particular tools available does not really enforce security.  For one, build tools don't give ordinary users any extra privileges - they're still restricted to the same parts of the filesystem they would be anyway.  They couldn't, for example, install code to run as superuser.  Also, regardless of what's installed system-wide a user could still install and run binary tools (such as compilers) inside his or her own home directories with their user privileges.\n", "Q: Can't restore GRUB after upgrade to 14.04 (\"grub_term_highlight_color\" bug) I recently upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 and, as dozens of other people, I was gifted with the grub_term_highlight_color bug.\nI then tried to restore GRUB by booting from a live CD and using boot-repair, but the process fails and generates log files, the last of which can be found here:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7375835/\nThe machine is a dual boot desktop (Windows 8 with UEFI). All /dev/sda partitions are listed in that log file, but the repair tool insists in saying that an error occurred with the boot loader (it says it couldn't be found).\nMaybe this is about UEFI or something else related to the Windows partitions. The fact is I can't use that computer any more, because neither Ubuntu nor Windows will load (and I'm clueless).\nI'm aware of all other related questions on Askubuntu - none of them worked for me. Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: I had a similar recent experience: upgraded to 14.04, none of the suggested fixes for this issue seemed to work.\nI suspect you have stale EFI files in your EFI partition. There is a launchpad bug specific to the EFI situation which I suspect addresses your case. The fix is to update EFI files manually. Here's a walk-through:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to live CD\n\n*Open xterm\n\n*Use parted to determine your EFI partition: sudo parted -l (substitute for /dev/sda1 in next step)\n\n*Mount your EFI partition: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n*Update the Boot EFI file: sudo cp /mnt/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /mnt/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi\nAlso see Upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04 broke Grub\n", "Q: How to uninstall or remove TLP?

Can anything be done about it? \n\nA: I found quite a bit of information about this on another source, can't remember where.\nIn the Add-ons section of the tools, disable all the unity, gnome and ubuntu extensions to firefox. Especially if you use AdBlockPlus (as I do) something in them is interferring with the operation of Firefox.\nThese extensions cannot be deleted from inside Firefox, merely disabled. If after testing, you decide that you want to permanently remove them, use the Ubuntu Software Center, select Firefox, and click 'More Info'. The extensions are checked there, and unchecking them and applying changes removes them from the system.\n\nA: The problem dissappears if you start from clean firefox profile. Then you can install adblock and it will work fine with the ubuntu extensions.\nIt seems the problem is something that remains in the firefox profile after the upgrade from 10.04.\nOne quick solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure firefox sync\n\n*Wait for sync to finish\n\n*Close firefox and move your .mozilla folder to .mozilla.backup\n\n*Launch firefox and configure firefox sync again\n\n\nUnfortunately firefox sync does not sync certificate's configuration so you have to move that manually.\nAfter that I can use all the extensions I used previously (adblock, noscript, ...) without the slowdown.\n\nA: Well I checked a youtube video, that shows a procedure, and it worked perfect for me!. Now firefox is way faster that before, and more than that, is faster than chromium!. The procedure is basically the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a new tab in firefox and write \"about:config\". Enter.\n\n*Press in \"I'll be carefull, I promise\", in order to get into the settings page.\n\n*Once in the settings page, In the \"filter\" field write: network.http\n\n*Go to the list below and double click \"network.http.pipelining\" in order for it to change from \"false\" to \"true\"\n\n*do the same for \"network.http.proxy.pipelining\"\n\n*Now, in the \"filter\" field write: network.dns\n\n*Go to the list below and double click \"network.dns.disableIPv6\" in order for it to change from \"false\" to \"true\".\n\n\nThat's all! now you have the Fastest browser you'll ever find!.\nJust for the record: Firefox version: 29.0 , Ubuntu version: 14.04\n\nA: after\nsudo apt-get purge xul-ext-webaccounts\n\nmy Firefox was fast again.

If you open/load the .torrent file in qBittorrent (or any client, for that matter), and set the save path to the directory containing the file you already downloaded, then qBittorrent will see that a file of the same name exists and that all pieces of the file have already been downloaded.

Has this happened to anyone? \n\nA: You're trying to resize the extended partition (/dev/sda2), which serves as a container for logical partitions. The partition you should be trying to resize is the logical partition (/dev/sda5). You could then either resize the extended partition and create a new primary partition or (better in most cases) create a new logical partition within the extended partition without resizing it. See here or do a Web search to learn more about the differences between partition types. Note that these distinctions apply only to the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table; the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT) doesn't draw these distinctions or have a 4-primary-partition limit. (I mention this mainly for completeness; you have an MBR disk and so are tied to MBR's rules.)\nIn addition, heed hmayag's comment about the fact that you're using an encrypted partition.

For previous versions of Ubuntu the guide:\nHow to make LBP-1120 Canon printer work?\nworked flawlessly, but for this version the capstsui shows me:\nCheck the DevicePath of /etc/ccpd.conf\n\nand accordingly printing does not work.\nThe ccpadmin gives me:\n CUPS_ConfigPath = /etc/cups/\n LOG Path        = None\n UI Port         = 59787\n\n Entry Num  : Spooler   : Backend   : FIFO path     : Device Path   : Status \n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     [0]    : LBP1120   : ccp       : //localhost:59787     : /dev/usb/lp0     : \n\nAlso I get the two numbers:\nsudo /etc/init.d/ccpd status\n/usr/sbin/ccpd: 9507 9506\n\nAnd printer is connected:\nls -l  /dev/usb/lp0 \ncrw-rw---- 1 root lp 180, 0 May  2 09:36 /dev/usb/lp0\n\n\nA: After numerous attempts I found a way to get my LBP1120 to work by using 32 bit driver instead of 64 bit one. Following:\nCan't get my Canon LBP printer to run under Ubuntu 14.04 my solution to the problem is as follows:\nInstalling the Linux capt driver\ndpkg --add-architecture i386\napt-get update\napt-get install libstdc++6:i386 libxml2:i386 zlib1g:i386 libpopt0:i386\napt-get install cups\n\nwget # I will fix soon but Linux_CAPT_PrinterDriver_V260_uk_EN.tar.gz\n\n# Now the system is prepeared for 32 bit driver\ndpkg -i Linux_CAPT_PrinterDriver_V260_uk_EN/32-bit_Driver/Debian/*.deb\n\nConfiguring LBP1120\nlpadmin -p LBP1120 -m CNCUPSLBP1120CAPTK.ppd -v ccp://localhost:59687\nlpadmin -p LBP1120 -E\nccpdadmin -p LBP1120 -o /dev/usb/lp0\n\n# Not sure if works flawlwslly but this should start ccpd driver on boot\nupdate-rc.d ccpd defaults\n\nNow you should connect the printer and try to get two numbers of command:\n/etc/init.d/ccpd status\n\nby starting (from my experience I do this until it works) and stopping:\n /etc/init.d/ccpd stop\n /etc/init.d/ccpd start\n\nNow if you have managed to get the two magical numbers then you are ready to open captstatusui with:\ncaptstatusui -P LBP1120\n\nand see if your printer shows that it is ready to print.

Is there any way to calculate it?\nAny suggestions is appreciated.\n\nA: The simplest approach I can think of is\n$ date; ssh user@server date\nFri May  2 13:45:28 EEST 2014\nFri May  2 13:45:30 EEST 2014\n\nThe first date will print out the current date/time of your system. The second will connect to your server over ssh (ssh user@server) and run the date command on the server. Assuming that both client and server are synchronized to the same NTP server and so have the same time, that will let you see the time difference. Note that this won't be 100% accurate since there will be a tiny delay caused by the launching of the ssh command but we're talking about milliseconds so I doubt it will make a difference.\nIf you need greater precision, use something like this which will show the nanoseconds:\n$ date +%T:%N; ssh user@server date +%T:%N\n13:47:21:739912080\n13:47:23:774238647\n\nYou can also use the verbose flag for ssh (-v) which will report the transfer speed. This only takes into account the time after the connection has been established and not the overhead needed for connecting in the first place:\n$ ssh -v user@server exit 2>&1 | grep second\nTransferred: sent 3272, received 1920 bytes, in 0.5 seconds\nBytes per second: sent 6556.2, received 3847.1\n\nThe command above connects to the server and simply runs exit to quit the connection again. 2>&1 redirects standard error to standard output which allows us to grep for \"second\" and get the stats.\n", "Q: Is it possible to develop Ubuntu Application using java I am a Java Developer & want to develop application for Ubuntu.\nI also visited developer.ubuntu.com site and successfully installed Ubuntu SDK and Editor but it is on Unity code and HTML views.

If it is not and the only other option you have is CentOS, you should have it in an else clause:\ndist=`grep DISTRIB_ID /etc/*-release | awk -F '=' '{print $2}'`\n\nif [ \"$dist\" == \"Ubuntu\" ]; then\n  echo \"ubuntu\"\nelse\n  echo \"not ubuntu\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Check for Ubuntu in the kernel name:    \nif [  -n \"$(uname -a | grep Ubuntu)\" ]; then\n    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade \nelse\n    yum update\nfi  \n\n\nA: Execute /etc/os-release in a sub shell and echo its value:\nif [ \"$(. /etc/os-release; echo $NAME)\" = \"Ubuntu\" ]; then\n  apt-get install updates \nelse\n  yum update\nfi\n\n\nA: lsb_release command is only work for Ubuntu platform but not in centos\nso you can get details from /etc/os-release file \nfollowing command will give you the both OS name and version-\ncat /etc/os-release | awk -F '=' '/^PRETTY_NAME/{print $2}' | tr -d '\"'\n\n# output :-\n# for centos -> CentOS Linux 7 (Core)\n# for ubuntu -> Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (version differ with different releases)\n\nYou can also get the os name and version separately.\nin your case to run update command you can use following script-\nos_name=$(cat /etc/os-release | awk -F '=' '/^NAME/{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}' | tr -d '\"')\n\nif [ \"$os_name\" == \"Ubuntu\" ]\nthen\n        echo \"system is ubuntu\"\n        os_versionid=$(cat /etc/os-release | awk -F '=' '/^VERSION_ID/{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}' | tr -d '\"')\n\n        case $os_versionid in\n                \"14.04\" )\n                        echo \"os version is 14.04\"\n                        sudo apt-get update\n                        ;;\n\n                \"16.04\" )\n                        echo \"os version is 16.04\"\n                        sudo apt-get update\n                        ;;\n\n                \"18.04\" )\n                        echo \"os version is 18.04\"\n                        sudo apt update\n                        ;;\n        esac\nelif [ \"$os_name\" == \"CentOS\" ]\nthen\n        echo \"system is centos\"\n        sudo yum update\nelse\n        echo \"system is $os_name\"\nfi\n\n\nA: I would use python\nif ! python -c \"exec(\\\"import platform\\nexit ('centos' not in platform.linux_distribution()[0].lower())\\\")\" ; then\n   echo \"It is not CentOS distribution, ignoring CentOS setup\"\n   exit 0\nfi\n\n\nA: Using this command works in CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian:\ngrep \"^NAME=\" /etc/os-release |cut -d \"=\" -f 2 | sed -e 's/^\"//' -e 's/\"$//'\nIn Debian it yields Debian GNU/Linux, in Ubuntu it yields Ubuntu and in CentOS it yields CentOS Linux.\nThe benefit of using grep, cut and sed instead of gawk is clear: Debian does not have gawk installed by default, so you cannot rely on it on random Debian box.\n\nA: Following @terdon's answer, I like the simple solution below:\ngcc --version | grep \"Red Hat\"\nif [ \"$?\" -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"OK, on centos\"\nfi\n\ngcc --version | grep Ubuntu\nif [ \"$?\" -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"OK, on Ubuntu\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Awk  is supported on almost every nix system so this should be enough so we not have to care about all tools.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDISTRO=\"$(awk -F= '/^NAME/{print tolower($2)}' /etc/os-release|awk 'gsub(/[\" ]/,x) + 1')\"\n\n[[ \"${DISTRO}\" = \"gentoo\" || \"${DISTRO}\" = \"ubuntu\" ]] && \\\nawk 'BEGIN{print \"'${DISTRO}'\"}' || \\\nawk 'BEGIN{print \"Unknown distro...\"}'\n\nPerl\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse Linux::Distribution qw(distribution_name);\nif(my $distro = distribution_name) { print \"Distro: $distro\\n\"; } else { print \"Unkown distro...n\\n\";}\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 not working properly after executing command After running the command\nsudo rm -fR /var/lib/apt/lists/*,\nmy system ain't working properly & many of the applications aren't opening.\nWhen my pc boots, black screen appears for some time.\nCan any one help?\n\nA: Type this in terminal\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nThis will re-create that file & upgrade your packages & as stated in comments below,\nsudo do-release-upgrade will you to Ubuntu 14.04.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on SSHD Drive with Windows 7 VM I'm totally new to Ubuntu. Only played with it in the last few days while I waited for the new drive to come  (LiveUSB persistent)\nI'm really impressed with it (and sick of Windows' sluggishness) and would like to use it as a permanent solution. However, I cannot use my architectural programs under Linux. For that I was thinking to use a VM and then run apps in Unity. Will I have big drawbacks in performance? (Beside the obvious RAM usage)\nMy other question is will Ubuntu use a SSHD Drive properly (use the NAND memory to speed up) or should I go with Windows 8?\nMust specify that my laptop has 6gb of RAM, Intel Core i5 CPU and dedicated ATI video card. The SSHD Drive is totally new, which I bought to replace the old dead one.\n\nA: SSHD drives like the Seagate I own do the hybrid SSD/HDD thing at the hardware level and present themselves as a drive that is OS agnostic. \nThere's nothing special you need to do in Ubuntu (or Windows for that matter) to take advantage of them, it's pretty much out of the box, the drive is doing the work at the hardware level.\n\nA: Depending on the programs, they \"should\" run fine in a VM. Programs that depend on lots of graphics power may show some performance loss. Some virtualization software has options for 2D or 3D acceleration that can help. Based on your hardware, the performance in a VM shouldn't be that bad.\nThe default installation of Ubuntu will handle an SSD just fine.

I've encountered a user who alleges that 25.0.1364.160 is the latest version, so I guess that she is still using Ubuntu Lucid (10.04), because chromium-browser is up-to-date in later releases.\nTo get a recent version, I tried to add the 14.04 LTS repository, and pinned chromium-browser:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty universe\"\n\ncat <<HEREDOC | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/chromium-browser-pin-400\nPackage:  *\nPin: release n=trusty\nPin-Priority: 400\n\n\nPackage:  chromium-browser chromium-browser-l10n chromium-codecs-ffmpeg chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\nPin: release n=trusty\nPin-Priority: 500\nHEREDOC\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI don't have Lucid at hand, so I tested the previous in a 11.10 live CD that I still had lingering around. Unfortunately, installation failed because of unmet dependencies. Before diving even deeper into resolving unmet dependencies, I want to know whether this way of getting the latest chromium-browser is viable.\nIf not: what is the recommended way of installing the latest stable version of Chromium on an old Ubuntu version?\n\nA: 11.10 has reached End-Of-Life status, and so won't get any updates from Ubuntu. 10.04 has reached EOL status for the desktop edition, but not for the server edition, so anything that might be used on the desktop but not on the server won't get updated.\nIf there is any chance that chromium-browser will install, it will be using the packages from Precise, since those have the lowest dependencies (in terms of version number). However, there's a good chance it won't work, since Google increased their minimum requirements a while ago for Chrome (and, by extension, Chromium) to Ubuntu 12.04.\nIn short, to get the latest Chromium, I would recommend your friend to update to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (which has desktop support for another year, I think) or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nCorrection: Starting with 12.04, the support periods for both the desktop and server versions is 5 years.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 is very slow to respond while Handbrake is encoding I've upgraded my Ubuntu 12.04 install to 14.04 using a fresh install.\nI have Handbrake installed using it's nightly PPA. and ever since I've been running it on 14.04, while using it to encode video files, the entire computer becomes unresponsive and very slow.\nI checked in the System Monitor and handbrake's instance has a \"normal\" priority, and even if I change it to \"very low\" priority, the system is still extremely slow.\nDo you have any suggestions? Thanks.\n\nA: Try to disable the \"Show system tray icon\" option in \"File -> Preferences\" (the little icon which shows you the completion percentage while a job is running).\nThis solved the problem for me.\n\nA: I can confirm that with the \"Show system tray icon\" box unchecked (it is checked by default), the desktop returns to normal operation.  however that may just be fixing the symptom, in the sense that the desktop is working well now, but not the problem.\nWith this option enabled in \"Preferences\", and nothing else of any note running, the Compiz process goes from 1% to about 18% of CPU time (on my system).  This is a huge amount of processor time devoted to updating one small app. indicator/icon.\nSo I think the problem is somewhere between Compiz and the Handbrake Icon/App Indicator.\nSystem Specs: Quad Core 3.3 GHz i5 CPU, 8 Gb RAM, Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty w. Unity desktop.\n", "Q: Forward slash (/) is not working after upgraded to 14.04 I'm using Lenovo G580, and I have recently upgraded to 14.04 from 13.10, after this upgrade forward slash (/) is not working and long press of backspace is also not working.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: When keyboard problems emerge after installing a new Ubuntu it may be helpful to double check the current keyboard layout and keyboard settings.\nClick on the gear in the upper right of the screen\nClick on System Settings\nClick on the Keyboard Choice\nDouble check on the Repeat Keys Settings on the Typing tab\nClick on Text Entry on the bottom of the Typing tab\nSee that the Input Source matches your input type (keyboard). You can also add more keyboard choices and see if any work better than the current choice. As you change the keyboard layout in this way the change is reflected in the little rectangle in the menu bar. By default you press the Super-Space key to go switch keyboard layouts.\n\nA: Hi John's answer helped me in solving this problem. The actual problem is that in Ubuntu 14 they have set the \"/\" forward slash as shortcut key for the Search launcher. To solve this:\n1) Click on the gear in the upper right of the screen\n2) Click on System Settings\n3) Click on the Keyboard Option\n4) Click on the Shortcuts tab\n5) Click on the Search row and hold down a new key, f.i.: \"F12\" or press \"Backspace\" to clear it.\nThat's it. Now you should be able to get a single forward slash again in the terminal or web browser.\nBest regards,\nArjan Burggraaf\n\nA: This is what helped me on ubuntu 16.04 running in virtualbox 5.2.18 under mac os.\nGo to: \nSettings -> Keyboard -> Layout -> Keyboard layout\n\n\nDelete all layouts except the English(UK) one.\n", "Q: How can I take a screenshot of the current video frame in Skype? I want to take a screenshot of only the video part that I am looking at and not the whole screen. It is possible in the Windows version of Skype, where we can just click the Take a picture button and we get the current video frame (picture) in our gallery.\nI've tried it on Ubuntu, but there seems to be no option for it. How can I take a screenshot of the current video frame in Skype on Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: This is not possible. The page says you need Skype 5.5 for Windows or higher.\nYou can use Shutter to make a screenshot instead. After you've installed Shutter you can bind it to your PrtScr key. Shutter has different modes (from shutter -h):\n-s, --select=[X,Y,WIDTH,HEIGHT]\n        Capture an area of the screen. Providing X,Y,WIDTH,HEIGHT is optional.\n-f, --full\n        Capture the entire screen.\n-w, --window=[NAME_PATTERN]\n        Select a window to capture. Providing a NAME_PATTERN (Perl-style regex) ist optional.\n-a, --active\n        Capture the current active window.\n--section\n        Capture a section. You will be able to select any child windowby moving the mouse over it.\n-m, --menu\n        Capture a menu.\n-t, --tooltip\n        Capture a tooltip.\n--web=[URL]\n        Capture a webpage. Providing an URL ist optional.\n-r, --redo\n        Redo last screenshot.\n\nSo you could bind PrtScr to shutter -s so you can select an area (in your case the area where your Skype video is displaying) to save to an image file.\nTo bind your PrtScr key to shutter:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search Dash for Keyboard and open it\n\n*Click on Shortcuts\n\n*Click on Custom shortcuts\n\n*Click on + to add a new shortcut\n\n*For the Name field, enter Shutter\n\n*For the Command field, enter shutter -s\n\n*Click on Apply\n\n*Click on Disabled to assign a key\n\n*Press your PrtScr key\n\n*Click Reassign\nNow you can use your PrtScr key to take a screenshot of an area.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 along Windows 8 - Do you recommend? I am having a problem with installing 13.04 on my Samsung, would you recommend to try installing 14.04 along Windows 8?\n\nA: You should have no conflict between systems.\nRemember that you'll need to use GRUB or LILO as bootloader, so install the Windows system first and after that let the Ubuntu installer overwrite the boot sector with GRUB.\nRemember to check the minimum requirements for both systems before doing anything:\n\n\n*\n\n*Official Windows® 8.1 & 8 requisites;\n\n*Official Ubuntu Desktop requisites.\n\n\nNOTE: Windows 8 is obsolete, use Windows 8.1 if you can.\nIn this community is forbidden to express personal opinions on other systems or on trademarks; I can only give you objective observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a Windows® system if you enjoy Closed Source software: on those systems you can't be operative without it, because the system itself is not Open Source;\n\n*The proprietary technology (like the one used by some eye candy games) used on Windows® may not be compatible with your Linux/Unix system but you should always find an alternative free software on your Ubuntu Repository; if you are a professional gamer you need Windows for now;\n\n*The concept of User Friendly is very different in Linux and you may need to read the manuals or ask for help if in doubt. The community will be always here to help with any Linux problem; Ubuntu has the instructions to solve almost any problem already installed.\n\nIn general you'll not need a Windows® system or any other Closed Source system, because Linux Ubuntu is a complete system.\n\nFollow the Official Ubuntu installation guide to know how to install your new Ubuntu system.\nI suggest to use torrent to download the Ubuntu DVD/USB image, this protocols guarantees the file integrity and doesn't weight on the servers; click here to do so.\nPlease, feel free to comment under here if you have more questions and click the up arrow on the left if I'm of any help.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server internet connection Im using windows 8 with USB Internet Connection.\nI have installed ubuntu server using Virtual Box.\nIn Virtualbox Network setting i tried all types of connections.\nStill ubuntu server is not getting connected to internet.\nIf i type \nPING GOOGLE.COM it gives me Unknown Host\nLooks like Ubuntu server in virtual box will not detect USB Internet connection.\nHow do i configure Ubuntu Server in Virtualbox to detect my USB Internet connection?\n\nA: Have you installed VirtualBox guest additions?

However when I try to connect to the internet, it gets stuck in the same place, and if I try to view it under my wireless connections, my computer will for some reason have created a new log of this network.\nBy this I mean, I will have changed the settings to WPA on \"My-WiFi\", and when it tries to connect it will create a new WEP connection called \"My-WiFi 1\".\nTried a few fixes but none have worked :/.\n\nA: Please Update with Wireless Router model and any pertinent info regarding that device.\nFor now, I'm assuming Your wifi router can in fact provide other forms of encryption.\nThe first thing we should know is what your device is named:\n$sudo iwconfig\n\nit gives similar output to ifconfig. What we care about is the device name. lets pretend it  is wlan0.\nnext, do $sudo iwlist wlan0 auth\nalternatively, \ndo \n$sudo iw list\n\nthis will tell you what authentication protocols your wlan0 device supports. \nIf there is something besides WEP available, Please tell us your preferred Authentication method, out of which your device supports. I will update my answer accordingly. \n", "Q: Ubuntu under VirtualBox in Windows 7 - how to set bigger screen resolution? I have a Windows 7 with VirtualBox. I did install a fresh downloaded Ubuntu 14.04 (64bit). I did install the guest additions. I wanted to set the screen resolution to a higher value than 640x480. I did go over on/off (top right)--system settings--hardware--viewing devices.\nI get only \"eingebaute Anzeige\" (German, Wnglish would probably be \"builtin display\") and only one screen resolution. I have found a howto for Ubuntu 9 and did try to edit/create an /etc/X11/xorg.conf. But this too didn't work.\n\nA: Original screen size was 640 x 480.\nIn Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager go to:\nFile -->  Preferences\nClick on  Display\nOn the Maximum Guest Screen Size dropdown change Automatic to None\nClick on OK\nOn my Dell Precision M6500A laptop system running Windows 7 after restarting Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager and then starting the Ubuntu 14.0.4 VM  my default screen settings (1024 x 768) were taken with (800 x 600) as a second choice\n\nA: Sometimes the packaged version of the Guest additions gives better results.\nSo I'd suggest to update the Guest additions with the VM package manager. So login first into your VM and open a Terminal to type:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11\n\nFinally restart the Ubuntu VM to complete the installation.\nYou should get access to higher resolutions now.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

Then you go to your running session of your virtualized OS and open a terminal. Go to your media path : /media/(user-name)/vbox.... (I don't remember the name of the CD) then in the terminal run the following command\n\napt-get install gcc (if you don't have it yet)\n./VBoxLinuxAdditions.sh (the name of your installation file (it ends by .sh)\n\nif the previous command don't work execute this one :\n\nsh VBoxLinuxAdditions.sh\n\nLet this run and reboot your VBox machine.

I am getting errors about dateutil not being present even though I have installed this package. Shouldn't \nimport dateutil \n\nwork after installing the above package? I am using Ubuntu 14.04 in case it matters.\n\nA: First make sure that you are not trying to import the module after activating the virtualenv. If you have your virtualenv activated and didn't supply the argument --system-site-packages while creating it, the module won't be available to you to import in virtualenv.\nIf you are not using a virtualenv and still unable to import the module, then make sure that you are using the Python 3 interpreter and not the Python 2 interpreter. Since you installed the package for python3, it won't be available to import in python2 interpreter. Next try to purge and reinstall the module using:\nsudo apt-get purge python3-dateutil\nsudo apt-get install python3-dateutil\n\nPurging the package and reinstalling it should fix any issues which was restricting to import the module.\n", "Q: Method other than TOP to discover running services I have a pretty old laptop running 11.10.

I can access my mikrotik route by its ip anywhere in internet. Is there is any way by that i can access my all those server remotely from anywhere by internet connection (I can access my local server in my local network)?\nI am using ubuntu server 14.04.\n\nA: First, I'm going to assume you're using IPv4 with NAT, and not IPv6. (IPv6 makes it easy. In fact, if you had IPv6, it would probably already work for you by default. Actually, it's probably more fair to just say doing stuff without NAT makes it easy, but that's usually not an option on IPv4.)\nAssuming your router is using IPv4 NAT, you will need to set up something commonly referred to as port forwarding. It allows you to map a port on your Mikrotik router to be passed on to a server's port.\nIn essence, you will be setting up a rule that tells the Mikrotik router that if it sees traffic address to it on port X, re-write that traffic on the fly to be addressed to your server's internal IP (usually starts with 10. or 172.16. or 192.168.) address on port Y.\nHere's how it's done on a Mikrotik router:\nFirst, go to the IP menu on the left, and then Firewall. Then make sure you are on the NAT tab, and then click the \"Add New\" button.\n\nYou will be taken to a screen like this:\n\nFor chain, pick dstnat. Clik the arrow pointing down next to Dst. Address and then enter the address that you can access your Mikrotik router by from the internet. Unless you know you are using UDP ports, click the down arrow next to protocol and leave it at 6 (tcp). For the Dst. Port, again, click the down arrow, and enter the port you want to use on the internet to access your server.\nNow scroll down the page:\n\nFor action, select dst-nat. Change the \"To Address\" to the internal IP address of your server (again, this should start with 10. or 172.16. or 192.168.). Change the \"To Port\" to the port of the service on your server.\n\nFinally, click OK (if you want to leave the page and put the settings in place) or Apply (if you want to put the settings in place and stay on the page to tweak them).\nOh, and if you prefer the command line way, you can do something along the lines of this:\n/ip firewall nat add chain=dstnat dst-address=69.69.69.69 protocol=tcp dst-port=5900 \\\naction=dst-nat to-addresses=192.168.1.101 to-ports=5900\n\nBased of the Mikrotik wiki page on port forwarding.\n", "Q: How do I upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 What steps do I take to upgrade from LTS 12.04 to LTS 14.04 with the least amount of trouble and loosing the fewest amount of data.\n\nA: You can upgrade ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 with do-release-upgrade command\nAlso check http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/04/upgrade-ubuntu-14-04-12-04\n", "Q: Evolution appears unable to store mail account details I am trying to set up Evolution with Exchange so I can bypass Windows for a bunch of office stuff. The problem I have is that when I set up my account, Evolution just doesn't seem to be able to store it. I provide the information, it seems to connect correctly, but then when I get to the end of the wizard there is no account configured. If I start Evolution again I get the wizard again.\nThis was a straight install of evolution and evolution-ews out of apt on a pretty much brand new 14.04 installation running Xubuntu on the front.\nI couldn't see any logs for Evolution so I ran it with CAMEL_DEBUG=true evolution to get a bit of debugging and the first few lines look like this:\n\n** (evolution:14167): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-wLqFGe8c5K: Connection\n  refused\n(evolution:14167): camel-WARNING **: Failed to initialize NSS SQL\n  database in sql:/etc/pki/nssdb: NSS error -8187\n** (evolution-alarm-notify:14173): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-wLqFGe8c5K:\n  Connection refused\nDatabase succesfully opened\n\nThis appears to be what was happening during the wizard, then once the wizard ends we get some regular behaviour where it creates databases and stuff.\nIt turns out that the next time I logged in, Evolution had the same account created four times, so apparently there was some problem there that it bypassed. It still can't retrieve messages from Exchange so it's as useful as a chocolate teapot, but this issue is kind of limited.\n\nA: Maybe your problem is related to this confirmed bug (Please indicate that the bug affects you, the bug heat will increase). A possible workaround which worked for many is found in comment 35:\n\"I was experiencing this exact same bug as well. Based on information I read in the corresponding RedHat report (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=879773) I was able to get this to work by removing all the Evolution configuration directories (which did have some prior attempts at configuration from a long time ago) and killing and restarting Evolution:\n[Fri Aug 8 10:02:25 EDT 2014] > mike at ossy in ~\nrm -rf .config/evolution/ .cache/evolution/ .local/share/evolution/\n[Fri Aug 8 10:02:40 EDT 2014] > mike at ossy in ~\npkill evolution\nI went through the account wizard again, and after adding the password prompt showed up and I was able to type the password and add the account.\" \nI also had the same issue as you did, but did not need to delete all the configuration fortunately. After login/-out of the session, gnome keyring would ask me for the passwords again and then the EWS-accounts would work fine. I just deleted the duplicate accounts as I tried several times to set it up. \n\nA: I just had to kill the currently running processes related to evolution, and start evolution once again. This worked for me.\nMethod 1\nFirst, list the PIDs of currently running processes for evolution.\nps -aux | grep evolution\n\nFind the relevant PIDs (PID1, PID2, PID3 ...) from above output and kill them in one go:\nkill PID1 PID2 PID3\n\nAlternative method\nIt may also work if you just logout and re-login to Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to change accels in GNOME 3.10?

However, changes applied to that file do not change anything, since Evolution seems to overwrite that file on startup. \nHow could I alter the keyboard shortcuts?\n\nA: You're on the right track.

It should contain grub no?\nThanks guys\n\nA: If by \"512k at start of the disk\" you mean 440 bytes, then no, GRUB should not reside there on an EFI-booting computer. On such a computer, the boot loader lives in the EFI System Partition (ESP) as ordinary file(s). You've got such a partition (/dev/sda1), but there's no evidence of GRUB installed on it. You may want to check that manually using an emergency system -- look for a directory called EFI/ubuntu on that partition. On an Ubuntu install, it will normally have a file called grubx64.efi, and probably another called shimx64.efi. If those files aren't present, then your EFI boot loader has failed to install. In this case, you have a number of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install GRUB manually. This can be done with emergency discs, using the procedure described here (although that's a rather inefficient procedure).\n\n*Install GRUB automatically. The Boot Repair tool can usually fix this problem relatively painlessly; however, you must be sure to boot it in EFI mode. Once you've booted, check for the presence of a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode and may proceed. If not, then you should check how you boot and find a way to boot into EFI mode. (Unfortunately, how to do this varies from one system to another, so I can't provide a simple set of instructions.)\n\n*Use my rEFInd boot manager: Download a USB flash drive or CD-R image, prepare the medium, and boot with it. You should see at least one option to boot Ubuntu. If it works, install the Debian-package version of rEFInd. It will then take over boot manager duties from GRUB.\n\n", "Q: Installation hangs up on 14.04 I'm trying to install 14.04 on a HP/Compaq laptop with 1.5G RAM and a 25G hard drive.

The main screen is 1280x800 and the extended screen is 1024x768.\nI installed variety. It changes wallpaper every 5 minutes.\nHowever it changes wallpaper only in main screen. In the extended screen the wallpaper stays always the same. It is the default lubuntu wallpaper. I tried to change wallpaper in extended screen using nitrogen but nothing happens. How to change wallpaper in extended screen?\n\nA: This is a super-old question, but I was annoyed by the issue today and finally found a solution. Note that this might only apply to LXDE, not to LXQt and hence might not be applicable for recent lubuntu versions.\nThe right way to do this is to have two files ~/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE/desktop-items-0.conf and ~/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE/desktop-items-1.conf.\nThe former holds the config for the first desktop, the second for the second desktop. The desktop settings utility only covers the first one, so you'll need to change the various wallpaper= values manually with an editor of your choice.\n\nA: Ok I found the solution.\nI downloaded and installed disper-indicator. It is a .deb package.\nI installed it manually because I could not find it in repositories. \nThen I have set disper-indicator to run on startup. So now I click on disper indicator and I configure the dual monitors \n\nDisper indicator can be found from this repository https://launchpad.net/~nmellegard/+archive/ubuntu/disper-indicator-ppa\nAdded later by Edit\n\nA: I actually had this same issue on Lubuntu 14.04 and it was driving me crazy. I changed the desktop wallpaper multiple times and ways, including even using Nitrogen and SyncWall both mentioned here. \nWhat worked for me was running the following: \npcmanfm --desktop-off\nfrom a terminal window.\nI hope that helps some wandering soul that is trying to set multiple monitors with different wallpapers.

Thus the need to split out fast-growing filesystems such as /var (After all, all those logfiles, caches, spoolfiles historycally were aggregated at /var to make this scenario possible)\nThe separation of /usr sort of predates package systems - it used to be an attempt to keep a read-only collection of software with special regard to diskless (or reduced-disk) clients. \nThe goal of that split was to keep system configuration and an emergency roadset for system maintenance on a per-system root filesystem, and share the large chunk of software needed or desired by the user(s) without replicating. \nA separate /var ideally allowed the root filesystem to be on partition mounted read-only, a concept that still would seem desirable for the use of media with limited\nwrite-cycles.\nSo for the moment, it does seem desirable to keep /var separate, but there doesn't seem to be a real benefit to keeping /usr on a partition of its own - it might be more economical to assign that space to the root filesystem directly, saving the overhead for a separate partition.\n", "Q: Double click not working as expected in file manager I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed on my laptop.

The only other example of this problem I can find is on askubuntu where a guy is asking exactly the same question I'm about to ask but it has no responses.

Reading the manuals implies this is what\nd-I partman-auto/choose_recipe select homes\n\ndoes but it also implies there's no \"default\" action - that is if my syntax for this line was wrong or if it was missing altogether, the installer would stop and ask me what to do.

The installer will look for this \"atomic\" recipe file in the following dirs:\n/lib/partman/recipes-<arch>-<subarch>/*\n/lib/partman/recipes-<arch>/*\n/lib/partman/recipes/*\n\nSearch for the atomic recipe in these dirs to see if it is defining what you want. \nHere is a preseed recipe that I have working on our PXE server to only set up a swap partition and use the rest of the disk for root(Ubuntu 14.04, netboot install):\nd-i partman-auto/init_automatically_partition select biggest_free\n\nd-i partman-auto/expert_recipe string             \\\n    swap-root ::                                  \\\n        2048 4000 2048 linux-swap                 \\\n            method{ swap } format{ }              \\\n    .                                             \\\n        100 10000 100000000 ext3                  \\\n            $primary{ }                           \\\n            method{ format } format{ }            \\\n            use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext3 }  \\\n            mountpoint{ / }                       \\\n    .\n\n#d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select swap-root\nd-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true\nd-i partman/choose_partition select finish\nd-i partman/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true\n\n\nA: I've found out what is going on. I'm not sure if I want to use the word \"bug\" to describe this but I've been able to repeat it and carry out tests to confirm my findings.\nLong story short - the machines I'm working on have a 240GB SSD and 512GB of memory. If I reduce the amount of RAM so it's less than 120Gb (half the size of the SSD) the atomic partition scheme works correctly. As soon as the installed RAM exceeds 120Gb I get a 9Gb / partition and everything else assigned to /home.\nI've got round this by learning about expert recipes and specifying a 64Gb swap partition. Everything else just falls in to place.\nI hope this helps someone else out.\n", "Q: Shortcut to rename workspace in Gnome You can \"right-click => Preferences\" on the Gnome workspace switcher to rename the workspaces.\nI'm wondering if it is possible to configure a keyboard shortcut to trigger renaming the current active workspace.\n\nA: Use dconf-editor from Terminal, navigate to gnome>desktop>wm> and then set workspace-names to\n [\"Internet\", \"Oracle\", \"Gimp\", \"PHP\"]\n\n\nA: There is no shortcut I am aware of, but you can write a script to change the workspace label:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\n#get desktop number\nn=$(xdotool get_desktop)\nn=$[n+1]\n\n#get current workspace label\net=$(cat ~/.workspacenames/names| sed -n \"$n p\")\n\n#prompt user for new workspace label\nlabel=$(zenity --entry --entry-text=\"$et\" --title=\"Workspace label\" --text=\"New label\")\n\nif [ \"$label\" = \"\" ] ; then exit; fi\n\n#replace the workspace label in our local file\nsed \"$n s/.*/$label/\" -i ~/.workspacenames/names\n\n#convert lines of the local file to an array gsettings can understand\nmagic=$(cat ~/.workspacenames/names | tr '\\r\\n' '|' | sed \"s/.$/\\\"/;s/^/\\\"/;s/|/\\\",\\\"/g\"|sed 's/\\(.*\\)/\\[\\1\\]/')\n\n#update settings\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences workspace-names \"$magic\"\n\nThis script assumes you have zenity installed, and have a local file called ~/.workspacenames/names which has a name for each workspace on a new line.

This is the reason why using Alt+Ctrl+L does not produce the same effect: none of those keys have any effect on the sidebar, dash or the Help screen.\nEither rapidly tap Super+L simultaneously (DO NOT HOLD DOWN Super), use Alt+Ctrl+L or find a way to remove the Super shortcuts for the Dash/Sidebar.\nEDIT: Also found that if your sidebar gets stuck, you can tap Super twice to get rid of it.\n\nA: You may have triggered the four-finger multi-touch command for revealing the launcher.

Can any one provide step by step installation of Open stack installation on Ubuntu 14.04?\nOr \nIs there any script like http://openstack.redhat.com/Quickstart for auto installation. I have tried devstack on Ubuntu but it didn't work ( Credentials Not Working ).\nDumidu answer did work (Installation) but there is no username or password for the installation, so there is nothing to check its working or not.\nIs there any way to install Openstack on Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can use devstack to deploy openstack on your machine. devstack is used for development and is probably the fastest and easiest way to deploy openstack. We first setup the environment to deploy openstack and then install openstack using devstack.\nPreparing the environment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deploy a virtual machine with ubuntu 14.04 as the guest OS on your ubuntu 14.04. You can use various hypervisors for deploying the virtual machine, I have used VMware Player. For instructions on how to deploy a virtual machine using VMware Player, refer to this tutorial:\n\n\n*\n\n*VMware Player- Installing and deploying virtual machines on ubuntu\n\n\n*Next, after you have deployed the virtual machine and it is ready to use, you need to clone the devstack script from the github repositories, so first install git using the terminal(press Ctrl+Alt+t together) and type:\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nand enter your password and wait for the installation to complete. Now get the devstack script using the command below:\ngit clone https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git\n\nThis will take sometime depending upon your connection speed.\nInstalling openstack:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the script and other files downloaded successfully, you will get a directory devstack in the folder you executed this command. Go into the directory and type:\ncd devstack\n\nand then execute the script that fetches and install packages required by openstack using:\n./stack.sh\n\n\n*You will be asked to set the password for administration and a few packages like mysql, rabbitmq, etc(six times in all); you could keep the passwords short and simple and may be even same if you don't wish to remember a different one for all. This will take roughly 2 hours to complete, again depending upon your connection speed (I assume it is around 200kbps). You can read about the script here. The script will download and install and start various services and packages.\n\n*The output of the execution explains what scripts are being downloaded and other installation output; this will be useful to troubleshoot if you end up with an unsuccessful installation. If the script completes execution successfully, you will the output ending with the following lines:\n\nHorizon is now available at http://10.1.119.60/\nKeystone is serving at http://10.1.119.60:5000/v2.0/\nExamples on using novaclient command line is in exercise.sh\nThe default users are: admin and demo\nThe password: password\nThis is your host ip: 10.1.119.60\nstack.sh completed in 257 seconds.\n\nIf you don't get this, the script encountered some errors and they need to be sorted out first.*\n\n*If the installation is successful, you can open a browser and type the URL as given in the output message:\nThis is your host ip: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nas shown above. **\n\n*You will get a page asking you the username and password. The username is admin and the password is what you entered when you installed openstack(the first of the six passwords). If you don't remember, open your localrc file in your devstack folder and check (It either be named localrc, or .localrc or local.conf).\n\n*If you ever happen to restart your machine or the virtual machine or even log off, you may need to restart openstack services since all of them are not started when the machine is booted. To restart the services, executed the following command on a terminal when you are in the devstack folder:\n./rejoin-stack.sh\n\nand if completed successfully, all openstack services will be started and you should be able to access using the same username and password.\n\n*The installation above does not install neutron(the networking component), to install neutron, add the following to the end of your localrc file:\ndisable_service n-net\nenable_service q-svc\nenable_service q-agt\nenable_service q-dhcp\nenable_service q-l3\nenable_service q-meta\nenable_service neutron\n#Optional, to enable tempest configuration as part of devstack\nenable_service tempest\n\nand then again execute ./stack.sh.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Though you can install openstack on a bare-machine(not a virtual machine), it is recommended to install it on a virtual machine for security and for ease of use. The devstack installation removes your administrative password(rather does not ask for a password even for privileged commands). Also, you can create clones of your installtion and then even if you mess up your installation, you can discard the messed up one and then revert back to the latest working image of the virtual machine. \n\n*It is better to install openstack on a new, clean virtual machine having an LTS OS on it, since support and testing is usually done on LTS, you will find more response on channels and forums if it is on an LTS version. Also the new virtual machine ensures there are no package version conflicts and helps in easing out the installation.\n\n*If you are behind a proxy, you may need to add them in the virtual machine as environment variables in your /etc/environment file if you want to add it globally or in your ~/.bashrc file if you want it locally and also in /etc/apt/apt.conf. You may also need to tweak the script a little if git is not able to fetch packages even after adding http and https proxies.\n*It is difficult to give a canonical solution to all those errors since a lot of ground needs to be covered and is nearly impossible to state them in one solution. After you have resolved the error that caused the script to fail, you need to restart the script using ./stack.sh when you are in devstack folder.\n**The reason you were getting the error when you logged in was because the installation was not successful or because you restarted, you need to restart openstack services if you restarted, if the installation failed, you need to troubleshoot the errors first and then restart the script.\n\nA: I am not sure, I never try it but see if this work for you \n# apt-get install python-software-properties\n# add-apt-repository cloud-archive:icehouse\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get dist-upgrade\n# apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-saucy linux-headers-generic-lts-saucy\n# reboot\n\nReference: http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/install-guide/install/apt/content/basics-packages.html\n\nA: At present Devstack/Havana release supports only till ubuntu 12.04.

This time and every time since, the installation was aborted and I got a fatal error saying:\nUnable to install GRUB in /dev/sda\nExecuting `grub-install /dev/sda` failed.\nThis is a fatal error.\n\nCan anyone please suggest a solution to this problem?\nIf any further information is needed I would be happy to provide it.\nThanks.\nWhen installing I get the following in details:\nubuntu kernel: [ 1946.372741] FAT-fs (sda2): error, fat_get_cluster: invalid cluster chain (i_pos 0).\nubuntu grub-installer: error: Running 'grub-install --force failed.\n\n\nA: I finally got it working, not sure which of the following did the trick but I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled Lenovo Fast Boot in BIOS.\n\n*Disabled Secure Boot in BIOS.\n\n*Booted from Live USB.\n\n*In boot menu Added backlight=vendor in Try Ubuntu configuration text just before quiet splash.\n\n*Chose Try Ubuntu.\n\n*In terminal ran sudo rmmod ideapad_laptop to enable wifi.\n\n*Ran installation and chose to install updates during installation.\n\n*EFI partition was selected automatically so I assigned 9700MB for swap space and 80GB for Ubuntu.\n\n*After installation completed added backlight=vendor to /etc/default/grub before quiet splash and then ran sudo update-grub.\n\n*Blacklisted ideapad_laptop to enable wifi.\n\n*Works fine so far. Thanks to everyone for the help!\n\n\nA: I got the same error while installing Ubuntu 20.04. Turned out that I had created \"logical\" instead of \"primary\" partitions during the installation process for both my EFI and root partition. I ran the installation again, this time configuring both partitions as a \"primary\" partition, and the error was gone this time.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. What I did was to leave the installation as it was, then I made sure my drive was in UEFI mode and booted from a live CD and installed boot-repair. \nTo do this I had to add the yannubuntu repository and then download it with apt-get. This was done the following way:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\nThen, when the program was launched, I checked all the options in Advanced Options > Main Options and clicked Apply.\n\nA: I had this issue when installing Ubuntu (not dual-boot) in my new build. None of the boot options described above would work for me. \nI had to disconnect my SSD and all USB devices so that Ubuntu would only recognize the 1T HDD for installation.\n\nA: I just had this problem installing Ubuntu 14.04 from a USB stick to a hard drive.\nThe problem was the USB stick was /dev/sda, installing to the hard drive /dev/sdb\nEven though the installer knew to install to /dev/sdb, it then tried to install grub to the MBR on /dev/sda, and failed.  The workaround was to go back to the menu, try again, say NO to automatically install to MBR of first hard drive and manually tell it /dev/sdb.\nThen everything worked.\n\nA: I don't have a Lenovo Yoga but I had the same issue on my desktop.\nIt has SSD and HDD drivers, it was listed like this:\nSATA#1 HDD /dev/sda\nSATA#2 SSD /dev/sdb\n\nAs always I'm trying to install the OS on my SSD. The installer is installing Ubuntu (or Linux Mint) on /dev/sdb but then is trying to install GRUB on /dev/sda. That is a problem.\nThe solution was to swap the SATA connections, like this:\nSATA#1 SSD /dev/sda\nSATA#2 HDD /dev/sdb\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Check installation media for corruption\n\n*Check BIOS and disable Secure boot\n\n*Disable Lenovo fast boot\n\n\nI assume you are installing in UEFI mode, so it might be nescessary to unlock System lock in BIOS. If neither works, I would assume that problem lies in dual boot. I myself am running Ubuntu on Y2P as I type without any problems.\nAs for blacklisting ideapad_laptop module, you may want to check github.com/pfps/yoga-laptop, as there are some Y2P specific drivers. Still work in progres tho.\n\nA: Ran into this very issue while installing on a Poweredge with scsi raid. I found that pulling out the USB drive prior to installing GRUB did the trick.\n\nA: I have the same laptop and for me everything works fine - but I installed the grub loader into the already existing EFI partition, which had the index 2 at the end of its name - it certainly wasn't the sda partition though, which was chosen by default. (So I chose my partition for installation above and below, there was the possibility to change the partition for grub installation.)\nI used an SD card for installation and started it in UEFI mode, because Windows 8.1 was pre-installed that way, too. (I'm sorry if I'm expressing this in a wrong way, but I only know about all this from reading in different forums before installing Ubuntu 14.04 about three days ago.)\nAnyway, everything works fine if you do it this way. Start installation medium in UEFI mode, choose the partition freed for the installation, install grub into the existing EFI partition.\nOh, and also, I didn't really have to change anything in the BIOS, I had disabled fast boot before and left it that way. It automatically changed something else, I can look that up again, if you want to know.\n\nA: I had the same problem when installing Ubuntu 15.10 desktop (dual boot on separate partition in Lenovo G40-45 laptop where Windows 10 is already installed and activated).  \nI had already disabled secure boot (as per my earlier experiences with dual boot - Linux and Windows).\nFinally I decided that I would try with secure boot enabled (as I expected things to have improved since 14.xx). AND IT WORKED!!! -- without any other adjustments (and without internet connection).\n(I installed Windows 10 while secure boot was disabled and then installed Ubuntu with secure boot enabled).\n\nA: I had a plethora of devices on a bare install and got this on 12.04 (last alternate manual install). Rather than track down where you specify to GRUB, I just acquiesced and moved the boot SSD to the sata-0 port so it would show up as sda.\n\nA: This problem occured when i tried to give new life to my VERY old hp pavilion dm4. It said it couldn't install grub and none of the buttons to do anything worked. I freaked out, and force shutdown my computer in the MIDDLE of installation. Luckily, I was able to boot on to the pen drive again. I later figured out that the pen drive had been pulled out a little bit, causing the installer to go nuts. It turned out for me it was a really simple little solution.\n\nA: It can't be /dev/sda itself, it have to be some partiton of it. As usual windows make one NTFS, one recovery and one UEFI for boot parition. We have to first identify this UEFI boot partition as to get dual boot working.\nMy bios is of ASRock. This is how I was able to make it grub install for dual booting.\nI think issue was I was trying to use just usb as bootable in the bootable drive options. \nOnce I chose usb uefi as bootable, I saw immediate change in partitions seen on parition layout GUI.\nI was able to see uefi windows boot manager partition at /dev/sda2, (which I identified from windows disk partitons as the one with EFI layout), this was not shown when I was choosing usb without uefi option as bootable drive. I chose this uefi partition as boot partition for my install.\nAfter that grub installed on windows boot manager partition and it  and dual boot started working.\n", "Q: Quake Terminal: Switch to numbered tab Is there a way to directly navigate to a tab in guake instead of cycling?\nIn most tabbed apps I can press ALT+1 to go to the first terminal, ALT+2 for the second, etc.  Guake seems to only let me cycle between tabs (CTRL+Page Down).\nI don't want to use yakuake.  I'm also aware of tilda but it's a little quirky.\n\nA: Yes, the tabs are numbered 1-10.\nKeyboard shortcut Ctrl+Fn gets you to the nth tab.\nSo, Ctrl+F1 gets you to the first tab, Ctrl+F2 gets you to the second tab, Ctrl+F3 gets you to the third tab, and so on.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set partition to root ('/') without reformatting? Long story short. I accidentally removed my GRUB, and my partition set with mount point '/'. I did remedy this by re-installing Ubuntu from a liveCD (USB), and set the mount point for the new partition (with 2nd version of Ubuntu) as '/', and the Ubuntu installer reinstalled GRUB. (I had tried using boot-repair, from liveCD but it was not working)\nMy question is: Is it possible for me to remove this old system to get back the used space, and re-assign my original Ubuntu to the mount point '/', without having to copy reformat et cetera? \nReasons why: \n\n\n*\n\n*I do not have a mass storage device which would have the space, to hold everything on this partition (current/1st Ubuntu).\n\n*No optical drive.\n\n*Lots of settings, and other things I wish to save\n\n*Computer was pre-packaged with Ubuntu, making finding drivers un-needed (would rather not have to go through hassle of finding everything, because I know some did not work in liveCD)\nLSBLK Below:\n\n\n\ndf -h --total\n\n\n\n(Edit: For more information)\nThe netbook I have was pre-installed with Ubuntu, so it was not set up in the 'normal' way i.e. my OS was not set up on the same partition as the MBR, and GRUB. There is also a recovery partition which contains the Ubuntu recovery. The boot information was set at /  for a mounting point. \nsda1 -- FAT32 Partition\nsda2 -- FAT32 Partition\nsda3 -- 2nd Ubuntu Install root directory ' / ' \n\nsda4 -- encrypted swap\nsda5 -- 1st Ubuntu Install home directory ' /home ' \n\nsda7 -- Other OS (Ubuntu 14.04)\nsda8 -- Unused\nzram0 and zram1 -- swap partitions for linux\n\nSteps Taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*From liveCD- opened terminal to clone /sda5  -- sudo dd if /dev/sda5 of=/dev/sda7 conv=notrunc,noerror\n\n*From new terminal did watch -n5 'sudo kill -USR1 $(pgredp ^dd) to see progress of dd (this took about 24 hours to finish)\n\n*Tried to load from hard-drive. System loaded into grub command line (not bootloader).\n\n*Ran liveCD again installed boot-fix, ran through repair. \n\n*Default OS is now set to sda5 in GRUB, still have messed up partition mount points.\n\n\n(Up to step 5 OS was intact)\n\n\n*Formatted sda7.\n\n*Resized sda5.\n\n*One of these last 2 steps destroyed GRUB, and bootability of partitions (i.e. none of the 3 Ubuntus will load)\n\n*liveCD, tried boot-repair 3 times, after 1st \"fix\" was unable to access GRUB options in advanced options of boot-repair (could not purge/reinstall GRUB)\n\n*Mounted sda5, to see if I could get files off, but the disk was unreadable. (Guessing due to resize in step #7)\n\n*Wiped everything and re-installed Ubuntu.\n\n*Unfortunately I have to redo all my settings, fortunately I do keep backups of important data, but still lost some.\n\n*Lesson to myself. Be careful when partitioning.\n\n\nAlthough it looked like booting would work with sda3 intact, it seems as if some of the boot information may have been stretched across partitions. Cloning from sda5 to sda7 (with dd) did not work either. (sda7 would not boot after sda5 was cloned over, but probably because of size difference, and cloning needs exact size to duplicate). So i formatted sda7, and expanded sda5. This caused my sda5 information to get messed up. If I only had information (not full system tweaks) the answer below would most likely work. \nThe biggest problem I had is that when using the liveCD, I had to mount my drives manually (using terminal, mkdir /temporary/folder/ , mount /dev/sdXY/ /temporary/folder), but not always.. sometimes the system automatically mounted, so I would have to dismount, if I wanted to change anything. It was inconsistent.  \n\nA: The easiest way will probably be to just move everything to /dev/sda3 since moving your / partition can be tricky (special files, grub, and stuff, see here)\nYou will need to boot from USB to use gparted to edit the partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all the files you need from /dev/sda5 to /dev/sda7, delete\n/dev/sda5\n\n*You should be able to move /dev/sda4 and expand /dev/sda3 into\nthe free space\n\n*You can then copy the files you moved to /dev/sda7 to /dev/sda3\n\n*Then you can delete /dev/sda7, move /dev/sda4 again, and finally\nexpand /dev/sda3 to fill the space\n\n\nYou will also want to edit the /etc/fstab to remove the reference to /home on /dev/sda5\nSince / remains on the same partition, hopefully grub will still boot fine. If not, you should be able to run Boot Repair to fix it.\nFYI: grub is installed on the MBR of the drive (which doesn't show up on lsblk or df), and the information about partitions and all is stored in /boot, which in your case will be in the / directory (on /dev/sda3)\n", "Q: Can't get server to respond to SSH I am the admin of a private server and I'm pretty new to administration.

Not so successful, so far:\nEvery attempt to have it write its backup via ssh results in a local directory tree opened at the directory where the deja-dup frontent got started:\nfor the record: user and server are set with the configuration utility, the backup is supposed to go to the directory /export/dumps/notebookhost/user/deja-dup\nUsing a small directory as source for the backup, for the sake of testing...\nresult: a local directory of /home/user/sftp:/user/server/export/dumps/notebookhost/user/deja-dup containing the backup (imagine this in a backup schedule of the home directory - each time it got called, it would bloat the homedirectory with backup+homedirectory, until the filesystem boundary is reached)\nCalling duplicity from the command-line works as it should - both using scp or sftp - once a keyphraseless public ssh key gets installed at the target host:\n duplicity sampledir scp://user@host//export/dumps/client/home/user/deja-dup/\n duplicity sampledir sftp://user@host//export/dumps/client/home/user/deja-dup/\n\nBut even after these methods are tried and verified (and the local mess cleaned), the frontend deja-dup still creates local directory structures starting at \"sftp:\"\nOmitting the username in the configuration results in omitting the username in the (local) path. Padding with /-es in strategic places only resulted in %2F-es added to the path.\nIf \"custom location\" is selected, the last uri generated for ssh is displayed as:\nsftp://192.168.178.12/export/dumps/client/home/user/deja-dup\n\nthis location is missing a / to successfully write somewhere else but the users homedirectory, however, it fails the same way as when selected through the \"ssh\" menu item. I tried to replace sftp with scp and ssh and only got differently named local directories. Quoting the uri does not work, since in that case it gets the path to the local homedirectory preprended. Escaping parts of the uri doesn't work either - the escape character gets inserted into the local directory name literally.\nNext try: using dconf-editor to circumvent parsing in the configuration tool. \norg.gnome.DejaDup.File path 'sftp://user@host:22//export/dumps/client/home/user/deja-dup/'\n\nIt's possible to add single quotes (as in all other strings) around the uri there.

It's not in the dependencies for deja-dup either, and so its absence led to the behaviour described. \nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\nfollowed by a reboot of the notebook fixed the issue. Now deja-dup --backup called from the shell results in the backup being sent to the correct location on the server as configured.\nFor further information on debugging the problem see my answer to the nautilus problem. \n\nA: The above didnt work for me however i did find a bit of a clunky work around.\nthe trick i have used is to \"mount\" the remote folder and trick deja dup in thinking its a local folder. \nIm not sure if i can link being a newbie but look up mounting ssh drives and/or doing it via CIFS. i know it wont be secure as SSH but on a small home network it works for me. \nSlight edit: this also effect smb as well as ssh so i do not think its limited to just ssh backup but all remote. \n", "Q: How do I install a specific version of java on Ubuntu I am trying to build Android from source and it require Java 1.6 to build.

However I get the impression that the CPU got's hotter in average than without this file. \nWhat changes from 13.10 to 14.04 may be responsible for this? \nIf this is a bug, for which package I should report the bug?\n\nA: This is a bug in the Linux kernel. However, according to https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71711, the top of the page says \"RESOLVED PATCH_ALREADY_AVAILABLE\", meaning that there is a fix. I think it has been fixed in Linux kernel 3.14.\n\nA: \nWhat changes from 13.10 to 14.04 may be responsible for this?\n\nIf I have to guess, it would be the kernel. The kernel is responsible for most power related stuff (fan, batteries, devices, large etc.) so is the usual suspect. If it isn't then there's no much where to dig from, some -firmware package, perhaps, but in these cases is for privative modules.\n\nIf this is a bug, for which package I should report the bug?\n\nubuntu-bug linux\n\nThis would call Ubuntu bug reporting helper and fill out most of the required information.\n\nA: I'd recommend installing fancontrol from the 14.04 repositories, and then configure it by running pwmconfig as root.\nAfter installing fancontrol I was able to reduce my server's noise from \"annoying\" to \"barely perceptible\" with only a small increase in temperature.  I monitor temperatures and fan speeds remotely and can confirm it reacts to temperature increases. \nWithout that I think you're probably relying on the controls built in to your hardware (my laptop has three settings for fan control, and one of them alternates between full on and stopped which seems to be what you're experiencing.\n\nA: How about this utility?\nWorked nicely on my Acer Aspire 5742G with Intel Core i3 processor, 8 GB RAM, 640 GB HDD and nVidia GeForce 520M with 1GB memory running Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS.\n", "Q: What happened to my settings?

But what is I'm connected to internet via a socks proxy? How can I share internet to my mobile devices then?\n\nA: The ap-hotspot solution is slightly out of date and has the added disadvantages of being complicated and incompatible with socks proxies. A simpler solution is to use ubuntu's built in network-manager to create the hotspot as detailed by http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/09/3-ways-create-wifi-hotspot-ubuntu/\nTCP traffic from the hotspot can be passed through the ssh -D socks proxy using redsocks. With redsocks installed and configured one can use iptables to redirect all traffic from the wifi hotspot to redsocks which then passes it through the socks proxy.\nFor instance if your wifi hotspot is on the 10.42.0.1/24 subnet and the incoming redsocks port is 12345 issue:\nsudo iptables -F\nsudo iptables -t nat -F\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 10.42.0.0/24 -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345\n\nFor a detailed set of instructions visit http://abidmujtaba.blogspot.com/2016/07/ubuntu-create-wifi-hotspot-access-point.html\n", "Q: 14.04: password not accepted after computer wakes up from sleep If i press Ctrl+alt+L to lock the screen, I can get back in by typing my password.\nIf I put the computer to sleep, wake it back up again, I cannot log in anymore because it says the password is invalid.\nThe password is valid, because when I press Ctrl+F1 to go to tty1 I can log in using my username and this exact password.\nCtrl-F7 back to unity, the same password is invalid, and I have to restart in order to log back in.

Merging does not mean working, it just means the code is to a degree good and can be merged without creating other problems. \niptables is still in the 14.04 and on any other distro until nftables gets a stable release (More so than the 0.3 that was again merged with the Kernel). This, with the fact that nft user-space utils are not there yet will make the wait for nftables a bit longer.\nWith that in mind, if you don't want to wait you can use the Nftables step by step installation which includes git cloning the Linux kernel and settings other variables so that you can have Nftables working on your end. This information can be found in regit.org \nAside from this, here is a feature request\n\nA: Starting from the very beginning of the 2018 nftable framework is ready to use in  production environments. It supports 3/4 of the existing iptables features, although it provides new features that you cannot find in iptables. \nFramework requires to have kernel >= 3.13, but running a newer kernel >= 4.10 is recommended.

I intend to run it as a local host only (mainly for testing out web design).\nMy question is about the operation I guess. I tried pinging my web server (ping -c (x) localhost) and it obviously came through loud and clear, but when I take it offline (etc/init.d/apache2 stop) I can still ping it and get a clear response back. Why is this? Does my computer become the default local host when the server is down?\nSorry, if this is a really stupid question. I'm very eager to learn the system!\n\nA: Ping requests are not handled by a web server - only http requests are. Ping requests are handled by the kernel, so you don't need a web server to answer a ping.\n", "Q: Why does my menu become transparent?

I'm glad I had a closer look at this.\n[Original Answer]\nI am in the process of configuring a system with an A10-6700 using Ubuntu 14.04 Server.\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of cat /proc/cpuinfo does not, and will not, reflect any processor boost. The boost is an autonomous decision on the chip based on potentially complex criteria. Read about it here.\n\n*The output of cpufreq-info will not show available boost frequencies, but the output of cpupower frequency-info will. For the A10-6700, it should show 4300 MHz (Pb0), 4200 MHz (Pb1) and 3900 MHz (Pb2) in addition to the regular 3700, 3400, 2700, 2300 and 1800 MHz.\n\n*The output of cpufreq-aperf (after modprobe msr) is comparable to the output of cpupower monitor. The frequencies shown by these tools are supposed to reflect boosts. \n\n*With the standard video driver or even the radeon module in the kernel, I did not succeed to get the A10-6700 to use a boost frequency (using stress --cpu 2).\n\n*Withe the ATI/AMD fglrx module loaded into the kernel, the processor will boost two cores permanently (and apparently also the remaining cores temporarily). This was tested without X being used or even configured.\n\n\nRemember, the decision for or against the boost is made by the APU autonomously. My guess at this point in time is that the APU cannot decide whether its current power dissipation leaves room for a boost unless the integrated graphics unit is adequately initialised.\nThe video output with the standard module differs from the output when fglrx is loaded. Therefore, we can only guess whether the kernel can put the APU into the presumably required \"smart\" (power loss aware) mode by itself, while still using the VGA module.\nUntil this gets sorted out, I will simply load fglrx. The downside is that building it it requires a lot of stuff which you don't want on a server and which needs to be deleted after compilation.\nAlso, fglrx is almost 9 MB in size. It's not a problem but knowing that it's mostly dead freight in this case doesn't make me too happy.\n[Edit 2014-Jul-24]\nI now reported this bug.\nI noticed another bug has also been reported: If in fact you use fglrx and try to use the Dynamic Power Management mode.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my Thinkpad running the same AMD A8-4500m on Ubuntu 13.10.\nI found this today, but my english isn't that good,so I didn't understand it.\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/boost.txt\nMay it be helpful for you.\nThe main commence I found is, that the Turbo Core isn't supported since 11.10.\nThat's all I found. Please prove me that I'm wrong.\n", "Q: Ubuntu password reset question unable to shutdown 12.04 So basically my father passed away has Ubuntu on a Lenovo t61.

PLease help!\nThank you\nscott\n\nA: Short answer\nUsually what I do is boot the machine from a Live Disc (from USB) then click the 'Try Ubuntu' option.\nExplained\nOnce the system is running I then mount the primary machine to my live disc giving you full root access to the machine when you sudo su (as the trial doesn't require a password).\n(Assuming you're root) However you could replace your dads password hash by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running passwd which will prompt you for a new password;\n\n*Once set cat /etc/shadow | grep 'ubuntu' will display you the password hash;\n\n*You need to mount the primary hard disk in order to forcefully write the new password;\n\n\nMounting the disk you will need to work out which disk is the primary; usually that's /dev/sda1.  To list the partition table you will need to run the following command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou'll seesomething like:\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048    39845887    19921920   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2        39847934    41940991     1046529    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5        39847936    41940991     1046528   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nThe importance here is to know you need Linux under System (not swap - that's something different.)\nThen you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change directory to establish the mount: cd /mnt;\n\n*Create a directory: sudo mkdir test;\n\n*You can mount your primary disk via sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/test;\n\n\nNow you should be able to access your dads machine via: cd /mnt/test/.\nGoing back to my point about replacing a root password, you could copy the password hash from the initial step and paste it into /mnt/test/etc/.shadow next to the root user.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: \"'Mega' object has no attribute 'get_name_from_file'\" when writing files to Mega I am trying to have deja-dup backup my system to my https://mega.co.nz account\n1- Déjà dup = Ubuntu easy front end to the powerful Duplicity\n2- Duplicity states it supports Mega as from version v0.6.23 (through a mega:// URI)\n---Using Duplicity v0.6.23----\nThe command \nduplicity /test mega://myemail%40yahoo.com:mypassword@mega.co.nz/test\n\nsuccessfully writes files in my Mega directory but it displays the following errors:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1489, in <module>\n    with_tempdir(main)\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1483, in with_tempdir\n    fn()\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1332, in main\n    do_backup(action)\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1361, in do_backup\n    sync_archive(decrypt)\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1094, in sync_archive\n    remlist = globals.backend.list()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backend.py\", line 429, in list\n    return map(tobytes, self._list())\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backend.py\", line 330, in iterate\n    return fn(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backends/megabackend.py\", line 115, in _list\n    % (self.__get_node_name(self.folder), str(e)), raise_errors)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backends/megabackend.py\", line 139, in __get_node_name\n    return self.client.get_name_from_file({handle:files[handle]})\nAttributeError: 'Mega' object has no attribute 'get_name_from_file'\n\n---Using Déjà Dup 30.0----\nIn the \"Storage\" tab, I select\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup location: Custom Location\n\n*URI: mega://myemail%40yahoo.com:mypassword@mega.co.nz/test\nbut it produces the error \"Backup Failed: Location is not mountable\"\nDo you know any solution to use Déjà Dup (or Duplicity without errors) to create an easy backup solution to mega.co.nz?\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: This is one of those wisdom of the ancients sorts of situations. \nSo, ummm...\nDear people of the future, here's what we've figured out so far:\nIt seems the code for the Python module has been deprecated. There's a link on the page that says there's something newer, but that link 404s.\nI'm using Debian Jessie, but I'm assuming it should be similar for Ubuntu. You need to edit the file /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mega/mega.py as root in whatever text editor you use. Then add the following code just under class Mega(object)::\ndef get_name_from_file(self, file):\n    for key, value in file.items():\n        if 'a' in value and 'n' in value['a']:\n             return value['a']['n']\n    raise RequestError(\"Could not find the file attribute.\")\n\nIt seems to make it so duplicity can actually restore the files that it backs up on Mega... which might be a bit important if you need it.\n\nA: I've used Mega directly via duplicity successfully.  I remember I had to grab a git checkout of the mega python module and even then had to fix a couple bugs with it.  But I don't remember that particular error.  So maybe the mega python module is just a little janky.\nAs for the Deja Dup \"custom location\" box, that is for GNOME urls like you would put in the File Browser location bar, not for duplicity urls.\nRight now, Deja Dup does not support Mega as a destination.

Open the iso file in ultraiso. Then choose the option to write to disc from bootable menu.\n\nA: Did You try to download ISO image again? Perhaps Your ISO got checksum errors. If not, try to download ISO image again, then burn this fresh ISO... But I'm informing You, that You don't need DVD for that. You can use pendrive for this, it's really faster, but it's require from You basic information about \"How to boot pendrive when computer is starting\". If You are interested to perform installation via pendrive, You should try app named UNetbootin: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ (backup Your pendrive before)\np.s. If this wont work, try unplug any USB devices from Your computer except mouse and keyboard. But if even this wouldn't work, You should try change SATA controller type, in Bios... To do this try F2 key and look for SATA type in menus, but remember previous settings and what did You changed - just in case.\n\nA: Try running your Ubuntu DVD burn on your Win7 computer first (Just select the option to try it out, don't install it) to make sure you are burning correctly.  \nIf the live iso does not run on your Win7 computer then your burning settings may be incorrect or the iso file is corrupt.  \nIf it does run on your Win7 computer, then perhaps your DVD drive on the WinXP PC might be faulty.

I downloaded version 14 and installed that instead (haven't tried to upgrade from there, but that seems like the way to go).  I'm not sure how to tell UBUNTU of the issue.  This forum doesn't look like it's monitored by anyone who can/will do anything about it.  (I've posted in another thread).  Lucky for me I only burned it to 3 DVD's before I came to this conclusion.\nI'm attaching a picture to show that the essential files for setup and install are missing in the root directory of the download.

This file creates some symlinks to some libs in /usr/lib\nIssue is , /etc/init/lightdm.conf also starts on \"filesystem\".\nIf I traverse backwards, mountall.conf is the file which emits \"filesystem\" event and when this event is generated, lightdm.conf as well as my custom firstboot.conf both try to execute their scripts but the ordering is not guarenteed and you can never tell which one runs first. Now I want to always ensure that firstboot.conf runs before lightdm.conf . How can I ensure this without editing lightdm.conf ( I know I can create a dependency by emitting an event in my firstboot.conf and modify the lightdm.conf to start on that emitted event, but I dont wanna do this. Need a better approach which deals only with my custom firstboot.conf  !!)\n\nA: There is no way to enforce the ordering of two upstart jobs that both start on the same event, the filesystem event in this case, according to the upstart cookbook. However, you can modify your firstboot upstart job to run before the filesystem event is emitted instead.\nFor example, if your script only requires a particular filesystem to be mounted, you can make it depend on just the mounted event for that one filesystem:\nstart on mounted MOUNTPOINT=/usr\n\nThis should cause your firstboot script to run after the filesystem you need is ready but before the filesystem event is emitted. Modify the MOUNTPOINT variable to be the filesystem mountpoint from /etc/fstab that your script will need to do its function.\nYou can also make your firstboot script execute before lightdm, if that's the dependency you want to express instead, by using the starting event, and make your script use\nstart on starting lightdm\n\n\nA: Posting an answer because I do not have enough karma to comment:\nstart on mounted MOUNTPOINT=/usr\n\nis not how to do it. This event will only be emitted if the user has a separate /usr filesystem, which is uncommon.\nstart on starting lightdm\n\nis the perfect way to do this. The starting event blocks lightdm from continuing to start until your job has started.\n", "Q: Remote desktop from Windows Mobile to Ubuntu I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, I'm wondering is there a any possibility, to share remote desktop from Windows Mobile Pocket PC device.\nLike ActiveSync Remote Display, from MS Windows Mobile Developer Power Toys.\nFirst I would like to try establish connection using ActiveSync, to check if this working with Wine.\nI think it's a first thing worth to try, but maybe some known alternatives? \nI was looking for SynCE, but it's damnably hard to find those packets good to my system, maybe some of you have a clear directions what to do, to bring SynCE to my system.\nBut like I've said, I'm also open on alternatives :)\nAny tips what should I try, any ideas or alternative routes, to solve this?\n\nA: Alright, on the first try I didn't found anything that works with Windows CE 5.2, just old bunch of software that didn't work for me. \nBut yesterday, I give it a try again and I found EfonVNC Server, it works great with any machine equipped with VNC Client that wants to connect it, Android, Linux, Windows.

Would that be any help if I can?  \n\nA: You should be able to access the files and copy them using any linux live dvd. \n\n\n*\n\n*Become root. sudo su usually works\n\n*mount the source and destination drives\n\n*copy the files\nYes, you can install from a live DVD next to an existing OS but I don't recommend it without a backup. One mistake and you could wipe your precious data away. Better to copy the files off first. If you have permissions difficulty that becoming root doesn't solve, look into chown to take ownership or chmod to allow access (both available on all distributions AFAIK).\n", "Q: Make Ubuntu compatible with Arabic language I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I want to make Ubuntu compatible with Arabic language Can you help me please\n\nA: *\n\n*اذهب إلى (Go to)\n\n\n*افتح (Open)\n\n\n*اضغط على علامة الزائد لإضافة لغة (Click on plus sign to add a language)\n\n\n*سوف تظهر لك اللغات (List of languages will show up)\n\n\n*إذا أضفت اللغة العربية سوف تجدها في القائمة الرئيسية الفوقية (If you added Arabic, you find it on the upper list)\n\n\n*إن لم تجد اللغة العربية في المرحلة الرابعة (If you couldn't find it in step 4)\n\n\nثم (Done)\n\nثم عد إلى المرحلة رقم 2 (Then go back to step 2)\n", "Q: Can't use boot from usb after installing ubuntu 14.04 I did a full install of Ubuntu 14.04 and am now trying to boot from the ubuntu 14.04 usb that I made but when I switch the boot order in the boot menu to boot from the usb it just goes back to my current install of 14.04 on my hdd and won't let me boot from the usb.

Do i need to install 32bit java and fire fox to get this worked? Is there any option in 64 bit itself\n\nA: Assuming that a 64bit system is used (the most common scenario nowadays), there are two approaches to make WebEx work in Ubuntu 14.04LTS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make it work \"natively\"\n\n*Use a self-contained manually installed 32bit version of Firefox/Java.\n\n\nWhile #1 is preferable because of automatic security updates and less clutter, I only got #2 to work properly.

The latter worked fine for only a few days. Moreover even when I log out, I'm not prompted for a password while logging back in.\nI read a bit more and found that in Trusty Unity has its own lock screen. So instead of the old lightdm/gnome-screensaver we can use Unity. I found this and tried to check if enabling the lightdm lock screen helped in any way. As it turns out I don't have the Lockscreen option as mentioned in the link.\nWhat could be a possible way to solve the issue?\n\nA: I'm using Gnome and I had the same issue that after the update to 14.04 the screen wasn't locked after the timeout. Interestingly it did work after I locked the screen using \"Ctrl + Alt + L\". \nI found that the problem was that gnome-screensaver wasn't started after booting, but was started when unlocking the screen.\nSo my solution was to add the gnome-screensaver command to the startup applications which solved the issue.\n\nA: Try these:\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver\nsudo apt-get install xscreensaver xscreensaver-gl-extra xscreensaver-data-extra\n\nThen search for \"Screensaver\" in the menu and tweak its settings to your needs.\nTo add Xscreensaver to startup, open Startup Applications and add \"xscreensaver -nosplash\".\nTo get CTRL + ALT + L to lock the screen and start the screensaver, go to System Settings > Keyboard and on the \"Shortcuts\" tab, under \"System\", change the \"Lock screen\" keyboard shortcut from CTRL + ALT + L to something else, then under \"Custom Shortcuts\", click the \"+\" button to add a new custom shortcut, under \"Name\" enter \"Xscreensaver\" and under \"Command\" enter \"/usr/bin/xscreensaver-command -lock\", then click \"Apply\".\nAnd finally, click next to the newly created shortcut and press CTRL + ALT + L to assign it to it (or use any other keyboard shortcut you want, but make sure it's not already assign to something else). Alternatively, you can run the following command instead of assigning a new keyboard shortcut for the old screensaver:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command\n\nTo revert the changes (go back to the black GNOME Screensaver screen), use the commands below:\nsudo apt-get remove xscreensaver xscreensaver-gl-extra xscreensaver-data-extra\nsudo rm /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command\nsudo apt-get install gnome-screensaver\n\nIf you've used the alternative method to assign CTRL + ALT + L to Xscreensaver lock screen, open System Settings > Keyboard again, remove the custom Xscreensaver command and assign CTRL + ALT + L back to \"Lock screen\" (under \"System\").\n\nA: As suggested here it is possible to trigger lock screen from command line. To enable the keyboard shortcut you have to create a custom keyboard shortcut and link it to your lock screen script.\nHere is how I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder ~/scripts and in folder create script lockme.sh\n\\#!/bin/bash\nDISPLAY=:0 gnome-screensaver-command -l\n\n\n*Create custom keyboard shortcut for lock screen: \nGo to \"System Settings\" > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts, and add a custom keyboard shortcut by clicking on the [+]. Give it a funky name and the command is in my case: /home/username/scripts/lockme.sh\nThen click OK\n\n*Set the keyboard shortcut: \nClick on the new created row and press [Super]+L on your keyboard to assign this keyboard combination to start the script.\n\nA: well, here I switch window managers quite often, \na way to grant any key binding will work for them all is to use\nxbindkeys and xbindkeys-config \ntip: if the grab key crashes on the config application, the config file ~/.xbindkeys has instructions how to set it manually or at least how to skip the grabbing and type the keys identifiers directly, here became:  \n#Screen Lock\n\"gnome-screensaver-command --lock\"\n   Control+Alt+l\n\nObs.: this works on ubuntu 16.04 but is available for 14.04 too https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xbindkeys\n\nA: To manually lock, use the \"Ctrl + Alt + L\" key combo. For automated locking use the \"Brightness and Lock\" applet in \"System Settings\"\n", "Q: Unity crashes unexpectedly, no option for recovery Sometimes my Unity session crashes just like that - no window decorations, no panel, but whatever was going on in the background continues, like music playback.

But there are facilities in the kernel to track/do everything. But doing it on your own will be a tedious task as you will need to do it with a C program. That is what the external applications are doing. Virtually every command you run, is a userspace application.\nLink posted by Paul doesnt mention one useful software. If you would like to see which application or process is using the bandwidth, I recommend using nethogs. Get it with sudo apt-get install nethogs \nUsage : sudo nethogs -p eth0.

I will tell you how to do that below :-\n\n\n*\n\n*Update your OS completely.\n\n*Go to this website.\n\n*Now select the appropriate options there. Note that you must select Linux x86_64 for 64 bit OS and Linux x86 for 32 bit OS.\n\n*Now if you proceed by selectin 'Display results' there you will find your drivers. \n\n*Before you begin downloading check the release notes and installer notes without fail. See if your system meets all the system requirements mentioned.(This way we can know if any of your system requirements are not met and then start answering according to that too. Added advantage for you, you know!) To check the system requirements, use the following commands:- \nuname -a    - To know your kernel version\nldd --version   - To know your eglibc version\nXorg -version   - To know your Xorg version\n\n*Now if all those requirements are met then proceed to downloading the driver. \n\n*Then follow the installer notes for successful installation.\n\n\nPS:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't think that your OS isn't supported by the driver just because the OS is not mentioned in the release notes of the driver!

I have tried these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup Disk Creator not recognizing selected ISO in 13.10 \n\n*Startup disc creator not allowing any iso to be loaded\nBut still aren't able to solve this problem. Can you please help me in this regard? Thanks in advance. \n\nA: .iso file is seen by startup disk creator when opening other dialog but never gets selected (its like it does not really recognize this file extension) but this does not happen with all .iso files.\nJust rename iso image to img extension\nmv imagename.iso imagename.img\n\nThis has happened to be on 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04 but I assume is a glitch of the program and not ubuntu.\nat least in my case I had to move img to Downloads folder otherwise \"Startup disk creator\" did not see it\nmv imagename.img ~/Downloads/imagename.img\n\nThen open \"startup disk creator\" and choose appropriate USB (img should be automatically chosen)\nFor more details on iso and img renaming look in\nHow to create an .img file from .iso on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Startup Disk Creator looks in the Downloads directory by default. If finds any ISOs it sticks and will only let you use that ISO with the highest number and Ubuntu in its name. I solve this by moving ALL the ISOs from my Download directory in another directory. Startup Disck Creator can't default to any ISO so it comes up blank. It will then let you select ISO's from other directories as normal.\nMy exact process is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all ISOs from ~/Downloads to ~/Downloads/ISOs\n\n*Run Startup Disk Creator, Source table will be blank\n\n*Click Other...\n\n*Open ISOs from any location as normal (in my case ~/Downloads/ISOs)\n\n\nHope this helps\nThis is only based on my computers running 12.04.4. Your mileage may differ.\n\nA: I am aware how old this thread is, but given someone with the same problem pointed me here when asking for advice, I thought I'd share my answer\nThe answer, alas, is to not use SDC, but the command line.\ncd path/to/iso/dir\nlsblk\n# (identify the flash drive - likely /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc or the likes)\n# (you should be able to identify it by its size - or just remove the flash drive, run lsblk again, see what disappears)\nsudo dd if=name_of_image.iso of=/dev/sdc # (as appropriate)\n\nThis will copy byte-for-byte the ISO to your flash drive, overwriting it completely. It will look like nothing is happening when you run the command, but that's just the 'dd' command - it's not verbose at all. Takes about 1-4 minutes depending on ISO side and write speed of the flash drive.\nNote that if this is one of the official Ubuntu respins (Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, etc) then it should be fine to boot from flash disk. Other ISOs may not have compatibility for being written to and booted from a flash disk.\nYou can convert an ISO to \"hybrid\" (CD and USB compatibility) by installing the syslinux utility and running isohybrid (which will modify the ISO file itself - maybe do this on a copy of the ISO)\nsudo apt install syslinux-utils\nisohybrid path/to/your.iso\n\nGood luck\n\nA: You can use unetbootin for making bootable usb stick. It works out of the box.\n\n\n*\n\n*To install use the command sudo apt-get  install unetbootin\n\n*open from terminal with command sudo unetbootin and give your password.\n\n*choose your iso image browsing the folder where you have kept it\n\n*choose your usb stick\n\n*click ok and wait until it is done.\n\n\nIt works pretty smooth in any platform.\n\nA: in Ubuntu 16.04, moving the ubuntu iso's out of the Download Directory to a sub directory resulted in an empty CD-Drive/Image block.

OR put all iso s in another directory under Downloads. Anyway, make sure there's no iso in the Downloads that you don't want to burn right now.\n\n*Even still the disk creator is not recognizing, then change the iso you want to burn into .img by simply renaming it. \nRemember to close and restart the Disc Creator after renaming. \nThis has helped me solve the above question more than a dozen times.

I have the following Upstart script saved as /etc/init/automount.conf:\ndescription     \"SOME DESCRIPTION\"\n\nstart on startup\n\ntask\nexec mount -t vboxsf WebApps -o rw,dmode=777,gid=GROUP_ID,uid=USER_ID /var/virtual/some_folder_name\n\nwhere GROUP_ID and USER_ID is some number I took from /etc/passwd\nPreviously before I upgraded my ubuntu from 12.10 to 14.04, this was working. After I upgraded it, I also upgraded the virtual box from 4.3.8 to 4.3.10. Subsequently, I think there was an issue with 4.3.10. So I downgraded the virtual box back to 4.3.8.\nNow everything is working with the shared folders. Unfortunately, this script is not executed, I believe. The reason is because, the mount is not happening on start up.\nI can still execute the command without any problem whatsoever. Why isn't Upstart able to run this any more? How can I tell what the problem is?\n\nA: By default Upstart should be logging what it's doing to /var/log/upstart/automount.log. That will show you output from it trying to run (and in doing so, should let you know roughly what the problem is).\nNothing in there? Try a sudo start automount and see what that does for things. If that works (and things are mounted), it's likely your start on startup line needs to change. It's possible that something else hasn't started up (I'm not sure what vboxsf requires) so delaying it until later might work.\nHowever, in your case I'd be tempted to drop the script completely and just use the more regular method of mounting things /etc/fstab. We already have a question with an answer that goes down this route:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to mount a VirtualBox shared folder at startup?\nThat's much more logical way of handling this (IMO). You can still pass in all the options, it's just rearranged to something (I haven't tested so you might need to jumble things) like:\nWebApps  /var/virtual/some_folder_name  vboxsf  rw,dmode=777,gid=GROUP_ID,uid=USER_ID  0 0\n\n", "Q: freetuxtv installed in 14.04 is not working I have installed freetuxtv and it went through the preferred language and installed my program list. \nI tried an outdoor channel and it said \"playing\" but also showed an error message saying that the channel may be dead.

When booting from USB in Windows 8? I tried to have a fresh install of latest Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 in my laptop running on Windows 8 using USB iso image.\nI am careful on all things like :\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS settings - External USB Flash drive - 1st Priority etc.\n\n*Tried Directly to BOOT from USB option as of advanced windows 8 option.\n\n\nStill, I am facing the error\nOperating System Not Found\n\nAny suggestions, geeks.\n\nA: The USB has problems booting under an EFI environment. Usually, this results in a simple GRUB prompt. What you may try doing instead is enabling the CSM of your EFI (System/BIOS setup). On mine (Lenovo), this is an option called something like \"Boot mode\" with the options of UEFI and Legacy. In my case, I would change this to Legacy. Then, your USB should be able to boot depending on how you made the USB in the first place (i.e. unetbootin doesn't work).\nHowever, since the install will be from Legacy mode, it will then only be bootable in Legacy mode, meaning you won't be able to boot Win 8.\nIn order to fix this, you have to enable EFI boot in Ubuntu after installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*From a terminal: sudo apt-get install grub-efi\n\n*Reboot, change the UEFI (BIOS) back to UEFI mode (as opposed to Legacy)\n\n*You should then be presented with a menu allowing you to boot several options including Ubuntu and Windows\n\n*A few buggy UEFI implementations can cause issues. If you run into any problems, I can try to guide you form there.\n\n\nOK, so it appears that you must have installed Ubuntu in legacy (non-UEFI mode). In order to fix this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up Ubuntu from Legacy (non-UEFI) mode.\n\n*From a terminal: sudo apt-get install grub-efi\n\n*Reboot and enter Setup (\"BIOS\") via F1, Delete, F12, etc.\n\n*Go to the \"Boot\" tab and move \"Ubuntu\" to the top.\n\n*Reboot and you should see the GRUB menu with options for Ubuntu as well as Windows.\n\n\nA: Yesterday I tried to make a clean installation of 14.04.1 on a Lenovo X121e, and got \"Operating System Not Found\" - no grub. \nSo I started over again with an old Ubuntu 10.04.2.LTS i386, that I still had around. That installation worked, grub now on board, and then I installed the 14.04.1 amd64 again, choking down the 10.04 partition to a few GB. And then the 14.04 started nicely. \nIt is not a clean solution, but got me through the problem. It might also work to upgrade the 10.04 to 14.04, but I didn't bother to try that. (The \"software update\" of 14.04 from 13.whatever was not a satisfying experience).\nSo obviously there is an essential feature in 10.04 (\"starting the operating system\") that is missing in 14.04, I guess someone should run a \"diff\" on these two ;-).\nhilmer_B\n\nA: Switching USBs worked for me.\nI had a similar operating system not found issue. I tried legacy boot mode and reconfiguring the USB device with LinuxLiveUSB, but to no avail. I ended up changing to a different USB device, which worked on the first try.\nBoth were 16 GB, both were formatted to FAT, but for some reason it worked.\n\nA: I was having an issue installing Ubuntu Desktop on a tower Thinkserver (it would say Operating System not Found after installation no matter how I configured it).  The work-around that worked for me was actually to download ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64+mac.iso from http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/saucy/.  It worked perfectly!  All I had to do from there was do incremental upgrades until I was at the latest version.  I was banging my head on this issue for a while -- I hope this post helps someone out there!\n", "Q: hook failed: \"shared-db-relation-changed\" when using OpenStack in the same system as Juju/MAAS I have been trying to setup OpenStack on 14.04 using one machine.

We've likened this \"Hulk Smashing\". Basically you're layering a ton of services on top of each other that all expect to own the machine.\n\nSo, what can you do to achieve isolation and still keep everything on one machine? Containerization!\nThe --to flag has a finesse about it which allows you to do co-location without the potential for catastrophic collisions. --to supports a syntax like --to lxc:0 and --to kvm:0 which will place the service in containers on the machine listed. Almost all the charms in the OpenStack deployment can be safely placed in LXC (or KVM) containers, with the exception of Ceph and nova-compute. Nova-compute because it in itself will provision VMs (and KVM inside LXC is weird) and Ceph because it needs to own disks. You can do an OpenStack deployment without Ceph so that's not a problem and you can nest KVM so nova-compute on KVM to create KVMs (or LXC) should work.\nAt this point it's all about performance and you won't really get a lot of that with this setup. It should, however, be enough to pilot the process.\n", "Q: VMWare Windows 7 (host) Ubuntu 14.04 (guest) shared folder won't mount I have a windows 7 with vmware workstation 9, and I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on it.\nI configured the shared folder in the VM/settings menu, and I can see it in the Ubuntu when doing vmware-hgfsclient.

How would I go about removing this?\n\nA: Edit: \nI found a very hackish but surefire way to hide the panel indicator.\nSimply replace the stock indicator with this one-pixel transparent PNG file (right click → Save link as to download the file).\nInstructions on replacing the indicator may be found here.\nOriginal answer:\n\nThere are various discussions about this on Google's product forums. The only solution I've found that partially works is to disable Google Now in Chrome's flags: \n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to chrome://flags/#enable-google-now\n\n*Set the flag to Disabled\n\n*Restart Google Chrome\n\n\nHowever, even with this flag disabled the notification icon can reappear under some circumstances:\n\nThe Notification Bell seems to reappear consistently when i fullscreen\n  a Youtube Video, even after deactivating \"Google Now\" and anything\n  that even mentions \"Notifications\" in the flags settings.\n\n--- Source\nGoogle's official statement on the matter isn't very satisfactory, either:\n\nHi All,\nAs mentioned on the flags page, those are experimental tools that can\n  get removed at any time. We are working on improving the notification\n  system and your options around controlling when to see them, which\n  will be included in upcoming releases. For Windows users, please try\n  clicking on system tray, customize link, which will open your control\n  panel. You can then change the settings for your notification area\n  icons for Chrome from there. \n- Sarah\n\n--- Source\nI guess we will have to wait for now.\n\nA: Open the URL chrome://flags in the browser. Now disable these flags:\n\n\n*\n\n*#enable-sync-synced-notifications\n\n*#enable-google-now\n\n*#device-discovery-notifications\n\n*#enable-experimental-notification-ui (Chrome/Chromium 34 only)\n\n\nClick the restart button at the bottom of the site.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 rt3290 driver is not working, soft blocked In Ubuntu 14.04, WiFi driver is not working.\nI completed this suggest

In output.mp4 there is no audio at all.\nI would like to use avconv because I have bunch of files on my xubuntu 14.04 server.\nWhat I am doing wrong?\nRegards.\n\nA: In your command you were not specifying what should be done with the audio track.\nTry this:\navconv -i P3040001.AVI -strict experimental -c:v libx264 -b:v 8000k -c:a ac3 -b:a 192k output.mp4.\n\nFeel free to tweak the bitrates as you like. You may use avinfo to get an idea about original bitrate and transcode to a similar one.\nYou can also use a GUI program like Avidemux.\n\nA: Try this:\n avconv -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -b 800k output.mp4\n\nthis will reencode the video using the libx264 codec with the rate at 800k and let the encoder decide to what to do with the audio to insure compatibility with the mp4 container. Adjust bit rates to your quality preference. All things considered you should allow higher bitrates for larger movies. (for instance a movie that is 1280x960 would need roughly 4 times the bitrate of one 640x480 to maintain a similar quality)\n\nA: Perhaps best option would be to use a preset for the x264 encoding and specify Constant Rate Factor (CRF) rather than a fixed bitrate. Sound from the source is not the best to start with but perhaps a conversion to a relatively low bitrate VBR mp3 might sound ok. Try the following:\navconv -i P3040001.AVI \\\n   -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 22 -tune film \\\n   -c:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 7 -ar 44100 \\\n   output.mp4\n\nand this might give reasonable video quality and perhaps better sound. Adjust the -qscale:a 7 setting for better sound, a lower number will give a higher bitrate target.\nIf avconv chokes on either x264 or libmp3lame you will need to  add in the appropriate libavcodec-extra*  package appropriate for your version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: System Settings won't load after Ubuntu 14.04 installation Since I installed Ubuntu 14.04, system setting won't load.

I have ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed on my machine with gnome shell  3.4.1 installed.   \nRecently,  I have installed AMD Radeon graphics driver from the AMD website in my ubuntu. After that I have noticed that after I type my password correctly on the login screen, desktop takes too long to come up.\nA black screen with a mouse pointer on it shows up for about 5-19 seconds before desktop shows up.    \nCan anyone point out the possible solutions or the possible causes of this? \n\nA: Both GNOME SHell and Unity 3D Shell are highly resource intensive. even my laptop has an AMD graphics hardware and I experience the same lag as you do even in gnome-classic session(although that is just for about 3-5 seconds at max because gnome-classic is very light on resources). \nYour problem might be because the drivers form the AMD website are not updated and fixed regularly. Using those drivers will help you to run the graphics hardware on your laptop, but they will cause some bugs and quirks on your system. Like the one you posted.\nWhy don't you try the open-source drivers developed by the community by removing your previous drivers(just do a google search and you get how to do that in Ubuntu) and then installing the fglrx-updates from the software center? They might work for you. (Although I am personally quite satisfied with the drivers form the AMD website.

I use the GIMP photo editor which automatically saves the converted files in .xcf format, but they cannot be reopened with any other app. How can I convert or save my images as JPEG or PNG?\n\nA: .xcf is GIMP's native project file format similar to how .psd is Photoshop's native project file format. As Louis already explained saving in such formats has the benefit of being able to make modifications to editable components, which comes in handy when you work on big projects and have features like non-destructive editing and a history of modifications.\nIt makes sense to save into a project file format that is not intended to be viewed in a typical image viewer when you have users that use the program extensively for bigger projects and not just plain open, modify and save modifications workflows and you want to have a clear distinction between project files and image formats.\nEarlier versions of GIMP allowed to save directly to standard image formats, this was remodeled into an export function with version 2.8. You can revert this through a plugin if you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*GIMP 2.8 doesn't allow to save usual image file formats (jpg, png) via Save dialog\n\nA: You have to export the image, not save it.\nTo convert:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the XCF file using GIMP\n\n*Click on File\n\n*Click on Export\n\n*Enter a filename\nIt'll be saved as PNG by default. You can use any other format by simply adding the extension to your filename (like image.jpg, image.bmp) or selecting another file format in the bottom right of the export window.\n\n*Click on Export\nThe downside of exporting is that you'll only save what you see. So all your layers will be merged, and all editable components you may have added (like text) are not editable anymore.\nSo, if you would like to easily edit your images in the future, also save it as a XCF file as this will preserve all layers, components and other things as they are when you close GIMP.\n\nA: I have been using free XNView to quickly view (top layer) XCF for years. That will batch convert almost all image files too, original program worked perfectly in Windows, One of my favorite programs ever.\nDownloaded the multiplatform deb to Linux Mint, works well so far, but can not vouch for stability or integrity. On Windows that new version had issues with a DLL to view SVG. (I didn't purchase that DLL.) No clue.\n(It may have lagged the Nero copy working (extensively) from CD Rom drives, I am not using its file manager function now) \n", "Q: Text editor for developers What's the text editor that appears in the photo on the \"Ubuntu for Developers\" presentation on the Ubuntu website?\n\n\nA: That is Sublime Text. It is not free.\n\nA: This is Sublime Text (as already pointed out by Cornelius).\nBut I can not resist my urge to introduce you to Emacs, the most wonderful editor.\nLet me tell you: Emacs can do wonders. If you learn it then you can edit text with amazing speed. You can customize it the way you want. You can write your own functions and what not! And most importantly, it is opensource (Sublime Text is not opensourced).\nSo if you are still deciding which editor to use, I will advice you to go for Emacs.\nIf you are only concerned about the look then you can do the same with Emacs.

Everything in ubuntu has different date-time formats. It is crazy. Is there a way to set the standard ISO date-time format (e.g., 2014-05-03T12:31) universally throughout ubuntu so that the ISO format overrides EVERYTHING?\nI currently have my locale set to an ISO standard (i.e., en_DK) but it is next to useless because few things obeys it. Terminal/Bash doesn't obey it. Nautilus doesn't obey it. the watch-command doesn't obey it.\n\nA: The simple answer is: no. I.e. not without changing all programs which don't pay regard to the selected locale for date and time formatting.\n\nA: Assuming, you configured it according to your distro's normal way and it works for some software, but not all. To get the remaining software to start displaying time according to system locale you should:\nFor open-source software:\n\n*\n\n*open issues on their bug trackers to let them know you want this.\n\nIf you want things to go faster:\n\n*\n\n*do it yourself and submit pull requests.\n\n*offer them enough money to work on this feature for you.\n\nFor closed-source software:\n\n*\n\n*ask them via some contact option (bug tracker, suggestions forum, Twitter, email).\n\n", "Q: how can I know if a binary is malicious? I downloaded a binary file from sourceforge and accidentally run it. How can I know if it is safe? I added my user to sudoers file before. Where can I submit it to scan safety?\n\nA: While I cannot attest to how well it actually works, there is an open-sourced virus scanner in the Ubuntu repositories: ClamAV . Once installed, run clamtk and it can scan the file.\nThere aren't very many AV scanners for Linux in general, but if you're willing to install non-free software you could also have a look at BitDefender Scanner for Unices\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a free key for private use here.\n\n*Follow the instructions here to add the DEB repo to your /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n*sudo apt-get install bitdefender-scanner-gui or sudo apt-get install bitdefender-scanner for the CLI version.\n\n*Run these commands to get rid of the segfaulting behavior:\nsudo bdscan --update\n\nRead the license and, at the end, type \"accept\" if you agree, then (as root):\n# cat /opt/BitDefender-scanner/var/lib/scan/versions.dat.* | \\\n  awk '/bdcore.so.linux/ {print $3}' | \\\n  while read bdcore_so; do\n      touch /opt/BitDefender-scanner/var/lib/scan/$bdcore_so;\n      bdscan --update;\n      mv /opt/BitDefender-scanner/var/lib/scan/bdcore.so \\\n          /opt/BitDefender-scanner/var/lib/scan/bdcore.so.old;\n      ln -s /opt/BitDefender-scanner/var/lib/scan/$bdcore_so \\\n          /opt/BitDefender-scanner/var/lib/scan/bdcore.so;\n      chown bitdefender:bitdefender \\\n          /opt/BitDefender-scanner/var/lib/scan/$bdcore_so;\n  done\n\n\n*Run the gui via the command bdgui (it should also show up in the launcher)\n\n\nA: If you're concerned about malicious sotware on your linux machine, you're more interested in rootkits than viruses. clamav is great, but is used mainly for protecting windows machines from viruses by scanning emails before they reach the target. \nYou may want to consider looking into rootkit detection. rkhunter is available through apt but will give you some false positives even on a fresh install. Read about it here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RKhunter\nas a side note, I've never had any trouble with sourceforge, though some of my windows using colleagues occasionally download apps from the misleading ads and install things that register as potentially malicious on their virus checker. \n", "Q: Vokoscreen Not Working On Ubuntu 14.04 I been trying to make it work on Ubuntu 14.04, but no luck .

All this happened after upgrade from 13.10 to 14.04. No explanation - pure voodoo.\nGrub loads the selection screen. For me Ubuntu boots perfectly. Choosing Windows leaves the screen either purple or purple with black spots. And stays like that. Numlock works, ctrl-alt-del works.\nI exercised several different combinations with boot-repair. Restoring MBR instead of grub lead to straight boot into windows as expected. Any other configuration - installing grub in MBR or on linux partition - returned the situation as described in the beginning.\nAfter a desperate attempt of checking keystrokes, I managed to discover an unexplainable (for me) but stably working procedure - when the blank purple screen is reached after choosing windows at grub menu, I hit 'y' - seems to me that it could stand for 'yes' but then it promptly proceeds into windows.

You will need to uninstall the ffmpeg version you have on your system. Please disregard my solution below.\nIncorrect solution:\nI had this issue with SimpleScreenRecorder 0.2.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit as well. It would seem that FFMPEG/avconv will seg fault when trying to identify your CPU capabilities (according to the developer of SSR).\nHere is a quick fix, that should help you. I did this, and it allows me to use SSR with MP4 and H.264 again. Open a new Terminal, and enter the following commands and hit Enter for each (it's just two commands):\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jon-severinsson/ffmpeg\n    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nWhat this does, is that it adds a PPA that contains a newer version of FFMPEG/avconv maintained by Jon Severinsson. The second command then checks for updates, finds them and installs them (in this case, it finds the new FFMPEG/avconv).\nThere you go! You should now be able to record with SSR again. I hope this helps you :)\nFurther information:\nThis problem only seems to affect Intel CPUs, and even then I'm not sure how many are affected. My Intel i7-4770 seg faults with FFMPEG 1.2.5-1, but my AMD 965 x4 does not with the same FFMPEG.\nBy default, Ubuntu 14.04 comes with FFMPEG 7:1.2.5-1. The PPA will bump this to 7:1.2.6-1 at the time of this writing.\nIf this does not solve it for you, then I recommend you alert the developer of SSR on his GitHub page here: https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr/issues?state=open\nI opened an issue for this, and I came to this solution thanks to his help.

I have tried to \"shrink\" the largest partition to 320Gb with success in order to create a \"Swap area\" and a Primary area with the \"/\" designator. When I reboot with my USB Flash \"Live drive\", the installation program will start to work. I go through the various steps until I am at the installation choice. I chose \"Something else\". \nOn all the instructional videos, I am supposed to have a free space created by the new unallocated partition. Instead, the installation software considers my new unallocated partition as \"UNUSABLE\" and because of this, I am unable to dual boot 14.04. I have learned that the problem is those preexisting four partitions (three created by Windows 7 and one created by Hewlett Packard). I have learned that I cannot have more than four partitions on this hard disk.\nOne video found a solution by removing one of the partitions (I assume it was the \"HP_Tools\" partition). When the fourth partition was removed, the \"UNUSABLE\" partition NOW becomes \"Free Space\" and the Primary and Swap area partitions can now be created and Ubuntu 14.04 can be installed as a dual boot.\nI do not know if this solution is correct or proper. What puzzles me is that I was running dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.10 without any problems. The \"Upgrade Manager\" suggested that I upgrade to 14.04. I tried and that is when my installation nightmare began. The Upgrade manager loaded 14.04 to my laptop, BUT 14.04 would not boot up!! I created the USB drive with 14.04 installation and tried to use it to help boot up. I accidentally wiped out the entire hard disk and had it dedicated to 14.04. It works!! But I wanted a dual boot. I have reloaded Windows 7 and am trying to dual boot 14.04. None of your instructions are helping me because of my 4 partitions.\nIs there any other way to dual boot 14.04 WITHOUT removing that 4th partition?\n\nA: I'm not sure I understand your problem in full meaning. But I think you should try with logical partitions. Logical partitions resemble primary partitions, although the number of logical partitions that can be created on a single physical disk is unlimited.\nUnfortunately I don't know what is the point to have those trash partitions like Hewlett Packard and other created by Windows7.\nI have Win7 and Ubuntu, for me, at this moment it's look like this\nMy tip is just: Try to create logical partition for linux, create primary partition for swap, create primary partition for win7. Inside extended partition try to create those 3(?) partitions in NTFS filesystem for Windows7 Hewlett etc (or leave free space for them?), but I'm not sure those partitions will work for win7 with this combination in extended, and I really don't know what is the point of their exist and how their work. :( Then try to install Win7 first, after that, install Ubuntu. \nGood luck with this, have fun\np.s If you load Ubuntu live from 14.04 you should have preinstalled gparted on board, no need to work in installation program\n\nA: I have discovered a solution to my dual boot problem. While reading an HP support forum, I learned that HP sets up its computers with 4 Primary Partitions (two for Windows and 2 for HP information). When I used Windows Disk Manager to \"shrink\" the largest Windows 7 Primary partition into a 323Gb unallocated empty space, I unwittingly created a 5th Primary partition on my Hard disk drive. Ubuntu installation software did NOT know what to do with the 5th Primary partition. This girl from the HP Support forum came up with a brilliant idea. Instead of erasing one of the HP Primary partitions, she converted the HP Primary partitions into Logical Partitions. This action reduced the number of primary partitions. She recommended a download of a free app called \"EaseUS Partition Master Free\" which converted my HP Recovery Primary partition into an HP Recovery Logical partition. The Ubuntu installataion software NOW saw the unallocated 323Gb of empty space as USABLE (because it became the new 4th Primary partition) and immediately took over and installed the Ubuntu 14.04LTS as a dual boot with Windows 7. I NOW have dual boot with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Windows 7.  Everything works. I am happy. By the way, I discovered that the Ubuntu installation software (the \"Install along with Windows\" option) created a Swap area of 16Gb which is exactly the amount of RAM memory on my laptop.\n", "Q: I want to dual boot windows with Ubuntu My computer originally had Windows 8 on it.

Is there a way to force gdisk to restore my gpt with my backup?\n\nA: The overlapping data suggests that you did not have a GPT disk to begin with, but in fact had an MBR disk and were booting in BIOS mode. (One of gdisk's features is that it automatically converts from MBR to GPT when you launch it on an MBR disk.) If I'm right, you can probably restore the MBR as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch gdisk, as in your example.\n\n*Load the (converted-to) GPT backup data, as in your example.\n\n*Type r to enter the recovery & transformation menu.\n\n*Type g to convert the GPT data to MBR form (in memory). You'll see a new MBR command prompt.\n\n*Type p to view your converted-to-MBR partition table.\n\n*Review the output to be sure that all the partitions are present -- none should be listed as omitted in the Status column. You may want to review the FixParts documentation, as FixParts uses this same menu, and the documentation describes the options in more detail.\n\n*Once you're satisfied that all your partitions are present and set as they should be, type w to save your changes and exit.\n\n\nOTOH, if you're positive that the disk was in GPT form and that the computer was booting Windows in EFI mode, then your partition table was simply damaged to begin with. In this case, you may need to delete that final partition and re-create it a little bit smaller to make it fit; gdisk won't let you save a damaged partition table.\n\nA: IMO, in my case when I removed data partition from W7, in GParted I got a message about corrupt gpt table, but when I merge this unallocated space with other linux partition, everything is OK.\nI am unending newbee, do not throw a roks :)\n", "Q: Pac ssh manager on Ubuntu 14.04 does not work I am using Ubuntu 14.04.

Any ideas that someone not familiar with Linux could understand and follow? \n\nA: You said the answer, the hard drive will always work (you can try with any OS on the other drive). Just open the PC and detach it. Some BIOSes may have the option to remove the drive. \n", "Q: Moving Ubuntu to new server I have an old Dell Precision 390 desktop with Ubuntu 10.04 that stopped booting because of \"a thermal event\". I cleaned it, reset the logs but it still won't boot. Not sure what my options are, but if I have to replace the machine, I am not really sure how to copy over my configurations - Jenkins, Postgres, MySQL, Java, Grails, etc. I thought I would move the hd over, but I doubt that would work.\nThe searches I have found indicate a backup copy (which I stupidly never did since it was \"just a dev box\"), or just doing a copy from the old to new hd. But since I can't boot this machine anymore, I can't do that.  Is it possible to just remove the hd and put it in a new computer?  \n\nA: As @Rinzwind suggested in his comment, moving the hard drive between machines will work, and sounds like your best option.  The only issue you might run into is that the name of your network interface may change (from eth0 to eth1, for example).\nThis change in network interface naming is caused by udev detecting an adapter with a different MAC address, and so giving it the next available name to allow you to have a persistent name-to-hardware mapping.\nUdev keeps this configuration in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules.  You can modify the name given to a MAC address there, or you can remove the un-commented lines and let udev re-learn the settings.  Either way you should reboot once you've changed the configuration settings.\nI would recommend letting udev regenerate the file because that way it will definitely be done right.\n", "Q: iptables ruleset blocking all network activity? I've gone through numerous trial and error to recently discover that my iptables result is the culprit of blocking all LAN and WAN activity.

Both have 500gb drives with Windows 7 dual booted with Ubuntu 12.04. Made DVD from ISO and installed 14.04 into Dell system. At install menu it said that it detected multiple operating systems and the 1st option was to install along side Windows in dual boot. Chose that option and 14.04 installed no problems on the Dell 755 Desktop.\nThen tried to install 14.04 onto the Acer system\nAt install menu it said it detected multiple systems but no option to dual boot. All options were to basically format the drive and only install Ubuntu. Both systems had more than enough space to install 14.04 so why does the 14.04 install DVD only do a dual boot install on the 755 but refuses to install dual boot on the 5515. \nUnfortunately, I'm not savvy enough to install 14.04 manually into the 5515 as a dual boot setup. \n\nA: I think you have one of two problems:\nYour ACER already has used the maximum 4 partitions\nIF this is the case, you have no choice but to delete and reclaim the existing partition(s) that were being used for 12.04.  Backup any files before-hand.\n\n\n*\n\n*See the official documentation on installing and upgrading\n\n*Information on partitions and methods.

Yet, I can't seem to find it so I'm planning to use Ubuntu as the OS and backup the files from Vista. Is that possible? If so, can you explain how it could be done.\nNote: It's possibility it could be either Windows Vista OR Windows 7. Also you may noticed that I'm new to Linux OS, so I need help switching over from Windows to Linux.\n\nA: Is you current windows install working/bootable? If so, you could simply use an external hard drive to copy files from Windows and the restore files to your new Ubuntu install. It should be easier if your external HD is formatted as FAT32.\nIf your Windows install is not working, you could use Ubuntu LiveCD to boot your computer, plug your external hard drive and copy the files.\n\nA: Welcome to Linux! Welcome to Ubuntu!\nThere are two main methods. Both work for Windows Vista or Windows 7.  \n\n\n*\n\n*If your Vista OS is working, then just copy all your data to an external drive or disc. Then install Ubuntu on top of Vista, wiping out Vista completely. Plug in your drive and you can see your data.  \n\n*Make a LiveCD or LiveUSB (for example using Unetbootin), plug in. transfer your data to somewhere safe, such as an external hard drive, and tnen install Ubuntu. If you are storing your data within the computer in any drive, then be careful during the partitioning step in installing Ubuntu not to erase that drive.\nIf you have data stored in default kind of folders in Windows like Documents, Downloads or Pictures, then to access those in Ubuntu LiveCD, just go to the drive where Windows is installed (there won't be any \"C\" drive or \"D\" drive, just drive names like \"Personal Drive\" and/or their storage sizes like \"150GB File System\". Search you Windows OS drive by that and then go to folder Users (if that's not there then that is definitely not your Windows drive) and then to the folder that has username you use to login to your Windows User account in Windows (like \"Ryan Jobs\", \"Kitty Kole\" etc.). There you will find the Documents or Pictures or Downloads folder from Windows.\n", "Q: Nautilus crashes after upgrade (12.04LTS->14.04LTS) i've upgraded my 12.04LTS Ubuntu to 14.04LTS. Everything installed fine, however my 'Nautilus' is behaving weird. It crashes every time i try to open a folder..\nMy whole desktop is blank.\nWhen i press Files it restarts the file manager (showing stuff on my Desktop and opening a new window with the files). But when i press any item (file or folder) it crashes everything, showing nothing (no desktop files or folders and window goes away).\nI've checked many 'solutions' that didn't work for me, for example:\nNautilus doesn't work.... from command or from unity\nAny suggestions what i can do?\nThings i've already done:\n\n\n*\n\n*reinstalled nautilus\n\n*installed some packages (python-nautilus i believe?)\n\n*fully (+purged) removed nautilus and installed it again\n\n*something with samba? idk lol\n\n\nBTW. I have also an SSD with a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04 that works totally fine!\nEdit:\nThis guy has a similar problem to me: http://nerdanswer.com/answer.php?q=339938\nPermissions are also fine (root:root, chmod=755)\nI ran nautilus -c which did gave me a specific error:\nrunning nautilus_self_check_file_utilities\nrunning nautilus_self_check_file_operations\nrunning nautilus_self_check_directory\nrunning nautilus_self_check_file\nFAIL: check failed in nautilus-file.c, line 8334\n      evaluated: nautilus_file_get_name (file_1)\n       expected: eazel:///\n            got: eazel:\nrunning nautilus_self_check_canvas_container\nLooking now how to fix, anyone suggestions..?\n\nA: I've finally managed to fix the problem. I've checked so many websites and the bugtracker of Ubuntu Nautilus. Spent the whole day looking for the cause; i'm not even sure if i found the 'real' cause. I even was unable to login again...lol.. :).\nFor the people who are experiencing the same problem; here's what i think is the problem: there were duplicates of extensions in nautilus (maybe caused by the upgrade?):\n/usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0\n/usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-3.0\n\nEven when i did: sudo apt-get remove --purge nautilus. It still stayed there (and maybe somewhere else). So what i did is:\ndpkg -l | grep naut* or dpkg -l | grep nautilus\nand manually removed all libraries listed until there's nothing left. \nA very important note: Your system might get messed up! Don't reboot before you installed nautilus et al again.. (When reboot, you might get what happened to me: 'Failed to load session' and virtual console didn't work..! More info down)\nNow, when you've REALLY removed everything, you can reinstall nautilus again:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus\n\nThen check your list again:\ndpkg -l | grep naut*\n\nIt should show the same list as before (without duplicates). And your nautilus is fixed! \nReboot to be sure that everything works fine..\nIf your reboot failed 'Failed to load session':\nThis happened to me, because i was too aggressive with deleting the libraries.. hehe. I accidently removed some core files of ubuntu.\nUse CTRL + ALT F2 (or F1,F3,F4,F5,F6; F7 returns back to the login). This will open the virtual console where you can try to re-install the packages you accidently removed.. (for me it was sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop and sudo dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-desktop; this will -i think- reinstall the deleted core packages again)\nReboot failed + virtual console failed..\nIf you can't enter the virtual console --> reboot and press SHIFT. This will give  you a list -safe-mode- where you can load the terminal from there. I selected one of the safe-modes on the top list. This will return a list where you can do some things. In our case we needed a wireless connection -loading takes a LOT of time- and the terminal.\nOverall i had a great time and learning experience; this was a good moment to learn some new bash commands and about Ubuntu. I love ubuntu 14.04 :D!\n\nA: I followed the solution here to kill running nautilus processes and it worked.\nNautilus not opening up, showing GLib error\nI've been experiencing a similar problem today, only I couldn't open nautilus at all. So I'm wondering if this is due to some recent update clash.\nThis isn't a likely solution, but at least it allows me to carry on as normal.\nFirst thing to try is sudo nautilus in a terminal. If it works, then it may mean that there is something wrong with active nautilus processess for your current user.\nTo be able to restart nautilus properly, do the following:\nSee what nautilus processes are running :\nps aux | grep nautilus\nKill all nautilus processes you see :\nsudo kill PIDNUMBER\nRestart nautilus :\nnautilus -q\n", "Q: Dual boot partition problem When trying to create a dual boot (windows and ubuntu) I ran in some trouble. Because I do already have 4 partitions, the 5th one is unusable for ubuntu to install. Now I'm really hesitating which one could be deleted or not. I have the following partitions:\ndevice    type   size     used      system\n/dev/sda1 ntfs   104mb    25mb      Windows 7(loader)\n/dev/sda2 ntfs   877973mb 195685mb  \nunusable         56624mb    an\n/dev/sda3 ntfs   64424mb  24054mb\n/dev/sda4 ntfs   1065mb   218mb     Windows Recovery Environment(loader)\n\nAs you can see, sda2 is my main partition, and sda 3 is my driver partition.  \nCan I safely remove sda1 or sda4 partition? I'm not sure what the \"loader\" is supposed to do.\n\nA: If you can merge the contents of your drivers partition onto your main Windows partition and get can confidently remove it you can delete that partition and add extended partitions using its space and the contiguous unused space.\nAt that point if you want to create an Ubuntu partition as well as create a new Windows driver extended NTFS partition you can.\nHaving four primary partitions is a dead-end it's best to avoid.\nIf your computer and Windows can deal with it you may also be able to convert the disk to GPT format--it doesn't differentiate between primary and extended partitions and can have a large number of partitions. Both Windows and your BIOS would have to support that move.\nI'm confused by one of your comments. You mention having allocated space for the Windows installer already. If I understand correctly and that's an NTFS partitions on the list never used you could delete it, boot from a DVD or USB Ubuntu installer, and then let the Ubuntu installer handle putting Ubuntu into an extended partition (not a primary one). Ubuntu doesn't generally install on an NTFS partition, using a different file system like Ext4. You don't need to create a partition for the Ubuntu installer itself. You can boot an Ubuntu install DVD and the software on it will do the formatting you need.\nUnless you are letting the Ubuntu installer do all the formatting automatically you will have to choose \"Custom\" for the install type.\nIn any case you would have to be careful about backing up and having a way to use the backup if there is a problem.\n\nA: My guess is that the Windows and Linux programs are not properly compatible. I suggest to revoke the changes you've made in Win and start the installer again. Then use the Ubuntu program to shrink /sda2 again.\nHope that'll work, good luck!\n", "Q: How can i connect to wlan with my BCM4313 (14e4:4727)? i am looking for help for getting my Broadcom Wlan card working on my laptop with Ubuntu.\nUntil now i was not able to get it to work.\nSolutions i tried for now:\n  1. using the additional driver that can be installed via the ubuntu additional driver menu\n  2. using ndiswrapper with the appropriate Windows XP driver for the BCM4313\nBoth solutions seem to have the same problems.

This works fine, it will start nicely when my computer switches on and it will even survive suspend to RAM.\nProblem is, imwheel often halts, when tv-browser.org pops up an automatic notification. I configured those notifications in KWin to always show on top and also enabled the focus steeling prevention. Also TVB is not the only program to kill imwheel.\nIf I haven't moved the mouse for a few seconds, imwheel will survive a TVB notification. If I'm actively using the mouse (scrolling/left-clicking/dragging) the moment, one of those popups appears, the extra-mappings of imwheel are defunct thereafter.\nI ran imwheel from the console: no errors get displayed. The process of imwheel is still hanging around, but doesn't do anything anymore. It happens about once every hour, so I pretty much cannot rely on the thumb button currently issuing the command, I programmed it to or issuing e.g. a back in Firefox per default-configuration bypassing imwheel.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Anybody else ever suffered this problem?\n\n*How and where to get help on this complex scenario?\n\n*Shall I report a bug against KWin? In launchpad or upstream at kde?\n\n*Who is maintaining imwheel? There is only an outdated http://imwheel.sf.net from 2004\n\n*Can you recommend a more up to date alternate software for mapping mouse-thumb-buttons to key-strokes in Kubuntu / KDE?\n\n\nThanks for your time and advice\nEDIT:\nFound more ways to kill imwheel almost reliably.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Firefox, when I save a small download / an image to my harddrive there is an animation of the green arrow icon. If I click my thumb-button (supposed to close the current tab by Ctrl+W) within two seconds of that animation, the tab won't close and imwheel is defunct everywhere (also in other programs/windows)\n\n*After switching windows or desktops I have some fancy 3D effects enabled. If I'm too fast clicking one of the thumb-buttons right after such an animation, imwheel gets defunct to.\nAs a wild guess I'd say, imwheel somehow tries to deliver it's derived key-events that translated from the thumb-button-presses, to some graphic overlay, which is not a full fledged window itself and certainly not supposed to ever gain keyboard-focus.\nFinally I found \"imwheel --kill\" to be way faster for reactivating it (instead of logging out and in again). I even mapped that to a global keyboard shortcut.\nEDIT2:\nDebug shows, imwheel is ungrabbing buttons 4 to 9 and then waits eternally, never grabbing them again. Only a restart with -k can bring it back.\nThe easiest scenario is to send a mapped thumb button to a configured window, which is in the background and does not have the focus. Debug output shows, imwheel testing against the window which has the focus, not respecting the mouse position over the other window. None of the ordinary rules apply to this window, but I made an exclude rule at the end of ~/.imwheelrc like this:\n\".*\"\n@Priority=-1000\n@Exclude\nmatching every window.\nRemoving/commenting this final exclude rule solves my problem. imwheel won't crash anymore.\n\nA: When running imwheel from the commandline, use the options '-d -D' to see debugging information.\n\n*\n\n*I have had some issues with imwheel crashing/freezing in the past, though mine is much less reproducible than yours. It looks like we're not the only ones having an issue with imwheel: There are two suggested patches on the upstream tracker ( sourceforge.net/p/imwheel/patches/2/ sourceforge.net/p/imwheel/bugs/8/ ) which may help with your issue.\n\n*Since the upstream project appears to be inactive, you may have better luck contacting the Debian maintainer for this project: chrsmrtn -AT -debian.org You might ask them to include one or both of the patches mentioned above. Package details are here: packages.qa.debian.org/i/imwheel.html\n\n*Since imwheel is not behaving as expected, the problem is most likely in imwheel. If you file a bug for this problem, the bug should be filed against imwheel.\n\n*The official support channel for this project is the Sourceforge page (see #1), which does appear to be inactive. (See #2 for more info)\n\n*Easystroke is an alternative. From wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/All_Mouse_Buttons_Working :\n\nGo to Preferences tab > Additional buttons > Add, and add any special button.\nNote: In case of easystroke doesn't automatically detect mouse buttons, you can specify it manually. Button identifiers (numbers) can be viewed by xev.\nGo to Action tab -> Add action, give the new action a name, as Type choose \"Key\", as Details set \"Alt+Left\" for Back button, \"Alt+Right\" for Forward button, as Stroke click the proper mouse button (confirm if a warning is displayed), and voilà! Your mouse button is configured. \n  \n\n\nA: I was recently bitten by this, too, and it appears to be a bug in imwheel that has to do with @Exclude. Apparently the code responsible for restoring key grab after an exclude is activated is never executed.\nThere's a patch in the link above, and here as well. Apparently, the bug has been known since 2004 :D\n", "Q: How to get Netgear A6200 to work on 14.04 I bought the Netgear A6200 USB wireless adapter, and I used WINE to run the installer from the disk that came with the adapter, but it failed part way through.  Is there any way to get this to work?\n\nA: With Ubuntu 14.04 I did the following steps:\nsudo apt-get install ndisgtk\nwget www.mediafire.com/?od9wpw6ccrnyhaa\nunzip A6200_Linux_drivers.zip\nsudo ndisgtk\n\nThen when ndisgtk is running, choose the file ending in \"ing\" that was unzipped. It should be bcmwlhigh5.inf. Once that is installed you can select a wifi network from the Network menu-bar item. \n\nA: Solved with https://github.com/jurobystricky/Netgear-A6210 - plug your device out before the following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/jurobystricky/Netgear-A6210\ncd Netgear-A6210\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nIf your device was plugged in before the above steps, unplug and re-attach, the OS will detect and you should see available Wifi hotspots\n\nA: The solutions I found, including the ones given here, did not work for me unfortunately. Seems to be some issues with newer kernels.\nHowever, I just found out what works for me. The following github repository contains many non-free and proprietary modules including one for the mt7662 chipset which is used in the Netgear A6200/A6210.\nHad to simply clone the repository in /lib/modules/ and modprobe mt76-usb and she now works like a charm.

I end up trying to reboot. At that point the network interface does not come back up\nIf I force it back up with sudo ip link set eth0 up the interface comes up, but shows no addressing other than broadcast information. It does not connect to the internet.\nHelp with this is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Ok, I ditched Microsoft and change my household computers and laptops to Ubuntu 14.04.\nAfter a week long searching the internet how to get a static ip-address on Ubuntu 14.04 I finally found a way.\nIt seems the network-manager is overwriting (or by-passing) my /etc/network/interfaces every single time, I thought of removing it but decided on trying to use it first.\nGo to the right upper corner and click the network icon, go down to the bottom and right click edit connections.\nThis opens network connections and choose the connection to change, click edit and go to IPv4 settings. Choose Method: Manual and then fill in the Address, Netmask and Gateway and your desired DNS server.\nJust save and your done. It will change to the given static IP-address on the fly even after reboot!!\nThis might be an old thread, but after a week of searching I updated the 10 first hits in Google. Hope to safe other people some time!!\n\nA: Was a very weird issue but in the end I got the Gnome-network manager working again.\nNot sure exactly what fixed it. \nI did remark (#) everything from /etc/network/interfaces, rebooted, but nothing changed.\nI believe the uninstaling and reinstalling the network manager fixed it. All I know is now I can access it from within Gnome 3 and set my address as static.\nI may disable this in the future if I decide to install XEN, but for now it's working the way it should.\nSpeaking of XEN - had was indeed preparing to do that today on another machine, but noticed I can't find any toolstacks outside of XL in the repo's. I'll post this as a separate question. \n", "Q: Find missing/moved video clip Kdenlive After moving a video clip used by kdenlive from one folder to another, kdenlive can no longer find the video clip and tells me \"missing clip\".\nHow do I tell kdenlive where the new location of the video clip is? Or do I have to delete the missing clip, add it back in, then re-add all of the crops/transitions/effects back onto the track?\n\nA: The only way I've found to fix this is to save my project, close KDEnlive, then relaunch and open the project.  KDEnlive will pop up a box with all the missing clips and give you the option to search recursively to find them.\nOnce it finds each clips' new folder, click \"OK\".\nBe sure to save your project again after KDEnlive has made the changes.\n(aside: would be nice if KDEnlive had an option to perform this recursive search when right-clicking a clip that has gone \"missing\"... maybe someday)\n\nA: I think the easiest way to leave the clip in its new location and still have kdenlive see it, while preserving your edits, would be to symlink it.  In the terminal cd to the folder where it used to be. Then, enter:\nln -s path-to-clip's-new-location clip's-filename\n\nFor example, if the clip were named clip.avi and your username were dave and the clip now resided in the Videos subfolder of your home folder, then the command would be, after changing into the directory where kdenlive expects the clip to be:\nln -s /home/dave/Videos/clip.avi clip.avi\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nA: Probably, not the most elegant, yet quite efficient way to re-map data location to your KDEnlive file is just open the project file (which is *.kdenlive) in text editor and manually replace required pieces of paths by mask. I.e. you moved your data from\n'/home/video/prj'\nto\n'home/video/prj/1'\nSo everywhere mask '/home/video/prj' is found, it must be replaced with 'home/video/prj/1'. When you complete all changes, just save the file and that's it. It opens in KDEnlive with whole new mapped paths to your data.\n", "Q: Multiple Connections through SSH We have a server which we connect through and do remote tasks.

I really do NOT want to have to start over with 13.10 every time there are routine system updates, so if anyone can help, I will be grateful.\nThe connection was working fine since I installed Kubuntu a couple weeks ago, and only went on the fritz after the update today.\nI found this in the logs:\n[   13.100650] realtek: No valid SSID, checking pincfg 0x40f79a2d for NID 0x1d\n[   13.100651] realtek: Enabling init ASM_ID=0x9a2d CODEC_ID=10ec0269\n[   53.887772] wlan0: authenticate with 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2\n[   55.019037] wlan0: send auth to 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2 (try 1/3)\n[   55.855573] wlan0: send auth to 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2 (try 2/3)\n[   56.868445] wlan0: send auth to 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2 (try 3/3)\n[   57.869344] wlan0: authentication with 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2 timed out\n\nnumerous times followed by:\n[ 6136.219868] wlan0: authenticate with 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2\n[ 6136.229893] wlan0: send auth to 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2 (try 1/3)\n[ 6136.231531] wlan0: authenticated\n[ 6141.237997] wlan0: deauthenticating from 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2 by local choice (reason=3)\n[ 6152.081403] wlan0: authenticate with 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2\n[ 6152.091258] wlan0: send auth to 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2 (try 1/3)\n[ 6152.092859] wlan0: authenticated\n[ 6157.097625] wlan0: deauthenticating from 00:18:f8:4a:a2:e2 by local choice (reason=3)\n[ 6161.162629] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n[ 6164.165572] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n\nI have no idea what it means or how to fix it, though.\n\nEdit: I have searched for 3 days for answers to getting this to work. I got a Netgear N150 USB WNA1000M adapter, and after following a youtube video for that installation, the best I can get is a few seconds of connection. It shows in connection manager as being connected, but I cannot even ping an outside source.\nI tried blacklisting the drivers for the onboard Realtek adapter, and that made no difference with the Netgear USB.\nIt appears that there is something in 14.04 that keeps it from working properly with some wireless adapters, or at least on this Toshiba Laptop. If I could find out what USB adapter would work out of the box, I'd return the one I have and go that route.\n\nA: I know, this answer sounds lame, but consider buying a new (Intel) wireless card to replace yours. You can get one for 15-25$ on amazon and specifically look for its compatibility with Linux. \nMany non-Intel wireless cards tend to work unreliably on Linux...\nA friend of mine had problems with his wireless on his notebook and that's how he solved the problem.\n", "Q: Where can I find the sudo commands to work on the ubuntu grub file?

The problem is that I don't know the sudo commands, particulary, the permission command and how to use. I'm planning on changing the boot menu to my satisfaction. This would include the order of the menu options, boders, colers and etc.\n\nA: You should use the sudo command and with whichever program you want to use to open the file. This looks like:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nIt asks for a password. Type your password and press Enter.\ngedit is a text editor.\nYou can also use grub-customizer.

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Still no result to launch the program.\nAny reason that it wouldn't come up?\n\nA: I haven't used ndiswrapper in many years, but here's what I found:\n$ apt-cache search ndiswrapper\n...\nndisgtk - graphical frontend for ndiswrapper (installation of Windows WiFi drivers)\n\nThat is probably the package you need.\nIf that is the package you installed, look for the executable by running:\ndpkg -L ndisgtk | grep /usr/bin\n\nThen run /usr/bin/whatever.\n", "Q: DockBarX autostart breaks shutdown menus Since I installed DockBarX in Ubuntu 14.04, I am unable to access the shutdown menus (shutdown, log-out, lock, et cetera) from the top-right gear-like menu.

How can I fix it?\n\nA: I had also the same issue recently with DockBarX. To fix it, I just added a delay for the DockBarX application to start. Modify the startup command to following:\nsh -c \"sleep 8 && dockx\"\n\nThe number 8 is the delay and it can vary with machines. So try a lower value like 5 first and increase it till the issue is resolved.\nSame issue is also having with Cairo dock.

One point to clarify though is that my question is in general about bash, not just specific to ssh.  I'd like to be able to do the same thing locally and issue a long-running command, then close my terminal.\nFrom my reading, I'm starting to get the impression that this might be an ill-posed question. If so, can someone suggest to me which component(s) I might need to dig into a little deeper.\n\nA: You can't.  There are ways to leave a program running in the background after you go, but to be able to reconnect later and interact with it, you need screen or a similar program.\n", "Q: Why /var/log/auth.log is using diffrent timezone?

THINGS DO NOT WORK THIS WAY anymore. Basically each program, or portion of a program in some instances, is supposed to control its own settings, including any sound alerts. It's basically not possible to have a program that communicates with, and can dictate to, each portion of the user interface. Some are easy to find, most are not. Just finding settings for them in say, your file manager, may be impossible! My, things HAVE changed in 10 years.\nBasically it's the way ALSA is designed, and most *buntu systems use it.

Brasero is installed by default in Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe following screenshots provide a visual explanation of the preceding paragraph. In the first screenshot CD/DVD Creator was selected from the dialog box that appeared after inserting a blank CD, and I dragged in an iso file that I wanted to burn to a CD.\n\nThere is no tab or button to select Burn image even though the file to be burned is an iso image file. There is no button to select the disc burning speed.\nIn the next screenshot a blank CD was inserted and Brasero was opened by clicking on the Brasero icon in the Dash. Under the Create a new project: heading Burn image is selected.\n\nThe iso image file is added.\n\nThe Properties button was clicked to open the Properties window. In the Burning speed dropdown menu the slowest burning speed is selected for the best quality.\n\nThe disc integrity is checked after it is burnt.\n\nThese screenshots are from the built-in Brasero Disc Burner application with no changes in the settings except for selecting the slowest burning speed for burning the iso image to the CD.\n\nA: Like Wilf says:\n\nThis CD/DVD Creator tool could be nautilus-cd-burner in launchpad and in ubuntu packages.\n\nBut it was last supported for Lucid 10.04 and it doesn't seem supported in newer versions of Ubuntu - you're using Ubuntu 12.04.

Is my machine possessed or in need of a new motherboard? Ubuntu 14.04\nI'm having incredibly frequent kernel panics that have been getting worse for the last week, after I installed and then removed Gnome and GDE.  At this point, it is almost impossible to work on the machine, as it dies at least within five minutes of booting, if not sooner.  I assume it's all panics, but about 50% of the time, it dies without a panic screen.  \nSometimes, it just goes into a hard reboot, sometimes, the screen blacks out and it does not want to restart, after killing these, the machine will not load the bios until the power is cut for ~5 seconds. Otherwise, it will display a panic screen, which at this point almost always is shredded or somehow corrupted graphically, with garbage pixels stranded or the text smeared across the screen.  If left to sit, the graphical glitches will occasionally change or flash.  The panics themselves are often different, some \"tried to execute MX-protected page', some \"CPU: 1 PID: 0 Tainted\", some \"CPU: 0 PID: 0 Not tainted\", etc.\nAlways accompanied by some manner of graphical glitching, either moments before it crashed or while it's frozen or while it's displaying the panic screen or some combination of all the above.  Most frequent glitch is as if the screen is broken into vertical bars spanning each an 8th of the screen, which are then rearranged. Other 'shredding' of the screen is frequent.  \nATI Radeon 200M\nAlways, compiz and xorg have been resource hogs, normally taking at least 20% cpu each.

Memtest crashed after 2% pass two out of two times.  The second time it was oscillating between looking normal and displaying random text shredded over the normal memtest screen.  The flashing red plus continued to flash but everything else was frozen. \nOnce out of the fifty-some times it's displayed a panic screen, it was complaining about the stuff it wrote to swap being corrupted, but that's never happened again.  \nI am at a total loss.  \n\nA: What you are experiencing sounds more like a hardware issue instead of a software one.  I would verify that all heatsinks are properly attached to your machine first.\nThen I would remove/swap/replace ram, until you are able to pass memtest.\nOnce you are able to pass memtest, then you can start worrying about Ubuntu.

Both are installed in my Dell laptop but the bios is not configured properly. I have to press F11 every time I need to use Ubuntu instead of Windows 8. I tried to use Boot Repair to repair it but was unsuccessful.\nHere the the output from my boot repair : http://paste.ubuntu.com/7390841/\nAlso, the Boot Repair said that :\nThe boot files of [The OS now in use - Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS] are far from the start of the disk. Your BIOS may not detect them. You may want to retry after creating a /boot partition (EXT4, >200MB, start of the disk). This can be performed via tools such as gParted. Then select this partition via the [Separate /boot partition:] option of [Boot Repair]. (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition)\n\nWhat should I do in this situation?\n\nA: *\n\n*Enter the UEFI setup (usually F1,Delete,F12, etc.)\n\n*Go to the Boot tab\n\n*Move \"Ubuntu\" up to the top of the list\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu installer does not see windows 8 after changing partitions I'm pretty new to Ubuntu (and Windows 8 for that matter).  Here is my story so far in case these details matter.  I have a brand new windows 8 machine, and I wanted to dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 8.\nI have a CD for Ubuntu 12.04.4 32bit.  I read that I needed to turn off Secure Boot and change my the setting in my bios form UEFI to legacy.\nThis allowed me to install Ubuntu 12.04.4 32bit, and I did so using the normal install (not making the partitions manually).  Ubuntu worked fine, but when I selected Windows 8 from the startup menu I got a Windows Boot Manager error saying something had changed and I need to repair the boot for windows.  I switched back to UEFI and Windows booted fine, but of course, I get no Ubuntu.\nSince then I have come to learn my error was installing a 32bit version under legacy instead of a 64bit version under UEFI.  So I got the latest version of Ubuntu (14.04) and put it on a bootable USB.  I also read that it was best to do the partitioning under windows so it essentially understands what is happening.  So I deleted the Ubuntu partition, the swap partition, and the 1mb grub partition, all of which I assumed were put there by Ubuntu.  I then created two new unformatted partitions which will eventually be used for Ubuntu and the swap partition.  I assumed the installer could handle creating another grub partition (maybe this is where my mistake is).\nSo here is where my problem comes in:  Now I have swiched Secure boot and UEFI back on and booted from my USB with Ubuntu 14.04.  When I get to the part where it asks me what type of install I want to do, it says no operating system found, and my only real option is to format and just run Ubuntu.  Yet, when I take my USB out Windows boots without any problem.  \nSo my question is, why is Ubuntu not recognizing that Windows 8 exists.  I know the old version did in legacy mode, and I think the new one did also before I changed the partitions.  Did this happen because I deleted the grub partition?\n\nA: I assume you are doing the \"do something else\" when asked to where to install the OS, not alongside windows, not by itself, do \"do something else\" choose a partition for ubuntu make it / so it knows where the root is. if you have more than 3-4 gb ram I dont even recommend swap, just waste of space, its for older computers and assuming your pc is win8 then it has to be new. at the same place where you choose partition for the OS, choose a device you put bootloader on and thats it, I always do it that way on any computer with any OS combination and never had a problem, hope it helps!\n", "Q: Installing (creating?) driver for Wireless adapter I'm very much a rookie with Linux and recently installed Ubuntu 12.04.

I use it as a virtual machine host (tasksel installed). meaning am running it with kvm + libvirt.\nI have set up the same bridge I had in 13.10.\nauto p4p1\niface p4p1 inet manual\n    up ifconfig $IFACE up\n    down ifconfig $IFACE down\n\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\n    address 46.182.xxx.xxx\n    netmask 255.255.255.240\n    gateway 46.182.xxx.xxx\n    dns-nameservers 46.182.xxx.xxx 46.182.xxx.xxx\n    bridge_ports p4p1\n    bridge_stp off\n    bridge_maxwait 0\n\niface br0 inet6 auto\n\nAgainst br0 I connect my virtual machines with <source bridge='br0'/> defined in libvirt.\nMy virtual machines get Router Advertisement messages without problem. All virtual machines get IPv6 addresses.\nMy problem is that IPv6 does not work over the bridge. But it does work when I turn on tcpdump against br0 for troubleshooting. I have tried setting the interface manually into promiscous mode but that does not make it work, ifconfig br0 promisc.\nWhy I have the IPv4 addresses on the bridge? I do not know, old habit, never question it. IPv6 does not work on the virtual machine host but the host get IPv6 address by RA, just like the virtual machines.\n\nA: have you enabled IPv6 on the interface at all? if the bridge device is br0, then do this:\nsysctl net.ipv6.conf.br0.disable_ipv6=0\nsysctl net.ipv6.conf.br0.autoconf=1\nsysctl net.ipv6.conf.br0.accept_ra=1\nsysctl net.ipv6.conf.br0.accept_ra_defrtr=1\n\n\nA: Every IPv6 address, even link-local ones, automatically subscribe to a multicast group based on its last 24 bits. If multicast snooping is enabled, the bridge filters out (almost) all multicast traffic by default. When an IPv6 address is assigned to an interface, the system must inform the network that this interface is interested in that particular multicast group and must be excluded by the filter. The following is a good introductory video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1JMdjnn0ao\nMulticast snooping is there to prevent flooding the network with multicast packets that most systems aren't interested. You can disable multicast snooping in small deployments without noticing any big difference. But this may have significant performance impact on larger deployments.\nYou can disable snooping with:\necho -n 0 > /sys/class/net/<brif>/bridge/multicast_snooping\n\nIf you want to protect your VMs from unwanted traffic and unnecessary packet processing, you can leave snooping enabled but also enable a multicast Querier on the network. A Querier will periodically broadcast query packets and update snooping filters on switches and bridges. It is possible to enable a Querier on your system with:\necho -n 1 > /sys/class/net/<brif>/bridge/multicast_querier\n\nIf you have snooping enabled, you must also have a querier on the network.\nThere's no need to enable STP. It's probably safer to turn it off, unless you know that you're bridging segments that result in circular paths. It's also irrelevant if you have SLAAC enabled (ie autoconf=1, accept_ra=1). Enabling PROMISC mode on the bridge implicitly disables snooping.\nHere's a nice summary of the modern challenges of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD).\n\nA: The only obvious problem I see with your configuration is:\n    bridge_stp off\n\nFor various reasons STP needs to be enabled on libvirt bridges.\nChange the configuration to:\n    bridge_stp on\n\nYou can also activate it immediately without restarting the network:\n$ sudo brctl stp br0 on\n\n", "Q: why do I not see desktop cube option in compiz manager Ubuntu 14.04 on a new piece of hardware (Samsung laptop).

So I think your laptop must be a 64 bit laptop. \nTry the entire process again from the beginning and when Ubuntu is installing itself on the system, then remove the internet cable or disconnect the wifi, becuase during installation, if Ubuntu is connected to the internet, then it might search for updates and start installing them, which is time taking(and probably made you think that it is downloading the iso again).\nI personally recommend Unetbootin. It is faster and simpler and more popular. So I recommend that you use Unetbootin to burn the Ubuntu 14.04 to your pendrive.\nIf the Ubuntu GUI does not appear that probably must be because it was not installed properly or probably the Ubuntu official distro is too resource intensive for your graphics hardware(although I am doubtful of this point-If your laptop is more than 6-8 years old, then try Lubuntu or Xubuntu) \nCheck to see if  Ubuntu is properly installed on your computer. Reinstall it. Start right from scratch i.e. making the Ubuntu Live USB. Redo the entire process to verify if its done correctly.\nAlso, I, as a beginner, often ran into issues when installing Ubuntu inside Windows. If you are an absolute newbie and rely heavily on Windows XP then I would not recommend this, but if you can take the risk why don't you install Ubuntu as the main distro on your laptop. That preserves Windows XP and increases performance of Ubuntu.\n(Windows XP ,by the way, is damn outdated and vulnerable to viruses since Microsoft stopped providing security updates to it from April 8 of this year. Why don't you try Windows 7...or get someone to install it on your machine if you don't know? You'll be surprised!)\nGive these options a try.

Since Ubuntu 14.04, the Linux kernel by default supports dynamic power management for open source drivers, which wasn't there before. It will improve battery life, reduce fan speed, and reduce laptop temperature by dynamically switching between two graphics cards when needed.\nAlso a lot of tweaks were added to support better battery life.\n", "Q: Unable to install VMware Player: Module VPMC power on failed I want to install Ubuntu on my VMware Player, but I facing the following error:\nVirtualized performance counters are not supported on the host CPU type.\nModule VPMC power on failed.

When your machine gets hot, the fan will run at top speed to cool it down again. This is a Good Thing® and you should not try to change it.\nIf you feel that it is happening too often, that it occurs even when the machine is not hot, you might need to tweak the default temperature thresholds. There is a nice little program, ThinkPad Fan Control that lets you do that for ThinkPads. \nYou should also read the How to control fan speed page on http://thinkwiki.org which is the site for Linux on ThinkPads.\n\nA: I am not sure it will work for all.\nI have an t540 with the same problem.\nMy problem was solved by editing the Bios Power Management seetings. On the menu item :Power > Adaptive Thermal Management\nScheme for AC: Balanced Scheme for Batery: Balanced\nI choosed balanced instead of Maximum performance for both AC adapter and Batery.\nAfter this, re-start the system and no more fan noise from time to time. To enter the bios, just type enter during startup.\nNow the Fan stays around 2000 with normal usage. I am not sure this is high or low. But it is not noisy. If you stop using many programs the fan can just go down to 0 rpm. When you activate any program again the Fan goes up to 2000 rpm or more (depending on the CPU usage of the application) and then stays at this level.\nOne tip is to install the lm-sensor and psensor to monitor your fan and CPU temperatures.\nI will monitor my fan from now and if any thing change I will post aother reply.\nAll the best, Gustavo\n\nA: I had the same problem with my T410.

Since I've upgraded I've noticed that my mouse starts to lag after I play a movie via xbmc or a video on Youtube in full screen mode.\nIt usually happens after playing a fullscreen video for around an hour. My mouse works perfectly on startup.\nI have just tried a fresh install of 14.04 and I've got the same problem.\nWhen I say the mouse lags, I mean that after I move the mouse it takes 1-2 seconds to respond and is continuously lagging ie. once it starts lagging it's constant and I have to reboot to fix the problem. I've tried restarting x but that doesn't fix it.\nI am using a Logitech K400 mouse/keyboard combo with a logitech unified receiver.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I had the same problem, but i fixed it. You need to install \"CompizConfigSettingsManager\" and switch off \"sync with VBlank\" in OpenGL tab. After that i installed PPA and update drivers for video card. It helped me. Here is video solution: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIQZv6MXzno\n\nA: This can occur if your bluetooth dongle is next to a wifi chipset for example. Just switch side to connect my USB dongle solved my laggy keyboard (my mouse was already fluid before).\nA fresh install rather than a upgrade is always cleaner. \n\nA: I actually found the issue to this problem and thought I'd do the right thing and post it. It would seem that the positioning of the bluetooth receiver in particular USB ports had an impact with the reception between the keyboard/mouse (probably something to do with the fact that it's a mini-pc and the processor and other radio affecting devices are situated so closely together and so close to the USB ports).\nI changed the logitech bluetooth receiver to a different USB port and my mouse/keyboard are working like a charm now.\nThank you to everyone for their input and help!\n\nA: I cannot find a solution to my problem so I am going to downgrade to 13.10.

I don't want Evolution, Tracker and other packages in my computer (Ubuntu 14.04, GNOME 3.9, Shell 3.10.4), but GNOME depends on these packages . I've read some tricks for disabling some of them without really removing their packages. Despite this methods, I'd like to know the reason for doing GNOME this way.\nI don't want to be FUD'ish, but in Windows there is \"Turn Windows features on or off\". Given the architectural superiority of Linux in this sense, shouldn't it be easier to disable these packages?\n\nA: Both the gnome and gnome-core packages are meta-packages. Removing them does not actually remove any installed programs. \nBriefly, meta-packages are a way of bundling multiple packages together. Installing a meta package will install these other packages but removing it will not actually uninstall anything.

I saw this command on a forum as a question for registering:\n\"date -u +%V$(uname)|sha256sum|sed 's/\\W//g'\"\n\nI think it depends on the time of my PC which changes every second, but the output is still the same every time I try it. So, can someone please explain how this command works? \n\nA: Let's break this into its constituent parts:\nThe date part\n\n\n*\n\n*date -u : as explained in man date, the -u flag makes it print the Coordinated Universal Time\n\n*+%V : the data command takes a format argument which is given after a +. For example:\n$ date +%m/%d/%y\n05/04/14\n\nSee man date for a list of all the formats it can produce. The %V means:\n\n%V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)\n\nSo, this week it will return:\n$ date +%V\n18\n\nAnd next week it will return 19.\n\n*$(uname) : this will simply print the result of the uname command which should be Linux on a Linux system.\nSo, putting all that together, the date command will print WeekNumberLinux:\n$ date -u +%V$(uname)\n18Linux\n\nThe sha256sum part\nsha256sum simply takes an input string and applies a hashing function to it. This produces a long string that is unique to the input given:\n$ date -u +%V$(uname) | sha256sum \n9a93b71d5b2841e649195bc81f8e38600860a040bc368cdbd0cde346b73248a1  -\n\nThe sed part\nThe sed commmand uses the susbtitution operator (s/pattern/replacment/) which will substitute pattern with replacement. In this case, the pattern is \\W which means \"All non-word characters\", meaning anything that's not [A-Za-z0-9_], not a letter, not a number and not an underscore. This is used to remove the trailing space and - from the output of sha256sum.\n\nSo, the command is a simple way of making sure you are not a robot. Since the date is printing the current week, your output will always be the same until next week when it will change.\n\nA: date -u +%V$(uname)|sha256sum|sed 's/\\W//g'\n\nRemoves all the non word characters from the sha256sum of date -u +%V$(uname) command's output.\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ date -u +%V$(uname)\n18Linux\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ date -u +%V$(uname)|sha256sum\n9a93b71d5b2841e649195bc81f8e38600860a040bc368cdbd0cde346b73248a1  -\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ date -u +%V$(uname)|sha256sum|sed 's/\\W//g'\n9a93b71d5b2841e649195bc81f8e38600860a040bc368cdbd0cde346b73248a1\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ \n\nFrom man date\n%V -  ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)\n-u, --utc, --universal    print or set Coordinated Universal Time\n\n", "Q: Error running Java web application with OpenJDK Java7 runtime in Ubuntu 14.04 I have fresh Ubuntu 14.04 install on my HP Pavilion g6 laptop.\nI have installed OpenJDK and IcedTea plugin in order to run Java applications as explained here.\nBut when I am going to chess.com website and select play against computer option it is showing an error. \"Click here for details an exception has occurred\"\n\nThen I ran firefox from terminal and opened Java application again.

You're going to have to reset some of these settings back to their defaults by running a few commands.\nReset Icons\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme 'ubuntu-mono-dark'\n\nReset Theme\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 'Ambiance'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme 'Ambiance'\n\nReset Login Screen\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nThe above will fix the looks of the unity.

Of course you need to be able to install Ubuntu first and be able to actually see those settings:\nIf you are using a regular Ubuntu DVD or USB-Stick press F6 in the boot menu and select nomodeset. If you are using UNetbootin select your boot entry and press TAB to edit the boot-options. Add nomodeset to the existing line and press ENTER to boot.\nIf you still get corrupted windows try the same with vga=771 instead of nomodeset. Now you can install Ubuntu. Of yourse your installed version of Ubuntu will get the same corrupted windows, so for one single boot you need to add the boot-option that worked for you to the boot line in GRUB.

I want to do this that way I can work on a website for my school, as well as have a space for me to develop that is completely sandboxed from one another and both hosted on port 80. (I do not need them running at the same time) Based on the research that I have done, I believe that this is the only way to do this, but if you have any other suggestions, I would be glad to hear it. I am not sure how to dual boot in the installation of the server because I am not used to how it looks. Do I have to partition it in the first installation or the second? How do I partition it? Are there any videos that I should refer to that might be able to guide me through it?\n\nA: For more information about dual booting in general check out this documentation. \nFor your specific case, this is what I would do. (Let's Assume you have 1 100GB Hard Drive and 4GB of RAM, you can adjust the amount of space based on your specific situation)\n1) Boot Ubuntu Server 14.04 and change the partition table to look something like this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Partition 1: ext4 50 GB Mounted on / (We will use this for the school instance) \n\n*Partition 2: ext4 45 GB Mounted on / (We will use this for the home instance) \n\n*Partition 3: swap 5 GB (This will be shared swap area for both instances) \n\n\n2) Now run the installer and choose the first partition for your school website. \n3) Reboot and run the installer again, this time choosing the second partition for your personal sandbox website. \n4) Reboot again, and you should see both options in GRUB, select the one that you want to use and you should be good to go. \n\nA: Have you Considered using LXC Containers? ( https://linuxcontainers.org/ )\nThis will avoid you having to partition your server all togehter.\nContainers are simliar virtualization, but each container is like its own OS however it shares the kernel of the parent OS but is an otherwise an completely sandboxed environment. It's really easy to create a container and start it.\nlxc-create -t ubuntu -n p1\nlxc-start -n p1 -d\n\nOnce that is setup, you can ssh into that container and do your development work.\nTo list your containers run this command:\nlxc-ls --fancy p1\n\nWe use containers at work to sandbox our web applications so that we can host several applications on a single server with out any overlap in each container's configuration. each of our containers has its own ip so we can forward any traffic to specific container if it needs to be public facing.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 installation hangs despite `-- forcepae` option trying to install the new Ubuntu 14.04 on my old laptop I got the message:\n*ERROR: PAE is disabled on this Pentium M\n(PAE can potentially be enabled with kernel parameter \"forcepae\" - this is unsupported, may cause unknown problems, and will taint the kernel)\nThis kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU:\npae\nUnable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU*\n\nThe laptop is a Toshiba Satellite M30X-124, with a 1.8 GHz Pentium M (I think its a Banias type one) and 2 GB of RAM.\nI have therefore tried the -- forcepae option via pressing tab during boot, F6 followed by ESC, selecting \"install...\" and adding the forcepae flag. I then see an \"ubuntu\"-logo in the middle of the screen and dots changing color below that. Only minutes later the dots stop changing color, the DVD spins down and the system stops doing anything. I've also tried booting up the live-system with and without the forcepae-option but always failed.\nDoes anyone have an idea how I can get Ubuntu 14.04 installed on the device? I don't have any other Linux system running and since I don't want any dual-boot on that laptop, I've already wiped the old Windows installation and cleared all partitions on the hdd so that the Ubuntu-installer can partition the hdd optimally.\n\nA: Since your system starts to boot user space it is probably not PAE at fault.\nRemove \"quiet splash\" from the boot parameters and add \"debug\" and hopefully you will see an error, or at least the point at which it hangs.\nOld laptops have old hardware, and in particular, old graphics cards, which haven't been well tested on the latest kernels and Xorg. It is possible that your system is hanging or crashing as Xorg starts. You can test this by booting the Ubuntu server install image, if it works then you can then complete the install, reboot, and 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' to install the graphical packages.\n\nA: Your system cannot support PAE,I suggest that you install the 32-bit version of 12.04 normally without any option. It seems both versions of 14.04 require PAE.\nAnother alternative would be to purchase a newer computer.\nIn case you do have a Dothan Pentium M, \nSee this\n\nA: The following instructions were written for Lubuntu installations.  However, the only important part (i.e. DUAL \"FORCEPAE\") is what will correct the problem.  The important part of these instructions is the following line:\n\nAdd 'forcepae' to the string before and after the two dashes (forcepae -- forcepae).\n\nThe \"dual forcepae\" has been the solution for all Ubuntu versions after 12.04, and in cases where the \"dual\" statement is actually not needed, it will not hurt either.\n\n(From) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PAE\nBoot the computer with an 32-bit Lubuntu DVD in the DVD drive.

Printing what's actually going on is much more useful for debugging.\n\n*You can use wget --output-document=/path/to/file to avoid cding before wgetting.\n\n*You can use tar -C .. to go to the parent directory before doing the tar operation without cd.\n\n*Why create a directory and a file name with the date? You only need a date indicator in the tarball name. The canonical solution for this sort of thing is to\ntmp=\"$(mktemp -d)\"\ntrap -- 'rm -frv -- \"$tmp\"' EXIT\ncd -- \"$tmp\"\n\nand store the temporary files there.

I was wondering if Ubuntu Server could be used to have a library of various operating system images (say, Windows 7, 8 & Windows Server 2008/2012 and possibly Ubuntu itself) that could be installed to client machines over the network. Possibly by PXE, CD or USB booting to something that would access the said network/server/library.\nI've done a little homework into things like TFTP and PXE booting, but I've never come across a specific \"follow this tutorial\" solution that would allow me to use the ubuntu server in my workshop to push operating systems onto machines connected via a switch.\nThe practical application for this would be having IT firms, depts or MSP's capable of using KVM & switch stations to do OS reloads in bulk without having to haul slower physical media around from station to station.\nI suppose you might compare this to a multi-platform counterpart to WAIK?\nInsight greatly appreciated friends :)\n\nA: Here is our build doc for creating this kind of server using 10.04 LTS.

Make sure to taste many flavours of linux (such as, say, Xubuntu as well).\nAnother safe way to test it would be using a virtual machine (since you'll be able to do so without damaging your system at all). \n", "Q: Upgrade 14.04 from 12.04 I use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I tried to upgrade it to 14.04 by booting from a usb stick. In the menu there were just two options - one was to install 14.04 by erasing 12.04 and another was to install 14.04 by erasing everything. But problem is both of them said that my documents, downloads and musics will be erased totally. Is there a way in which I can upgrade my OS to 14.04 without losing any data?\n\nA: Yes, but not from a usb stick if I understand correctly. You will have to get online to where you can upgrade directly from the ubuntu servers. \n", "Q: Using part of an external hard drive for ubuntu and another part for windows I have a 1TB external hard drive that I have installed ubuntu 14.04 on, partioned as 150gig for ubuntu and 2gig for swap space. The remaining memory is free. What I am wanting to do is use the remaining 800+gigs for misc files in windows 7 while keeping ubuntu separate. Since the drive is partioned as ext4 file system, windows will not even recognise the drive. Is this possible? \n\nA: Windows will still recognize the disk drive. It will recognize the partitions you already have on the drive, but will be unable to allow you to do anything with them, or tell you anything about them other than that they're there. You will still be able to partition the remaining space.

On starting PC, it asks me to select Windows 7 or Ubuntu 12.04. In windows, I have 3 parts, Drive C,D,J. When I open Ubuntu, I have category named \"Devices\". In that, those parts(C,D,J) are there with different names. But a part named \"79 GB system\" seems to be C drive of Windows but it has some things which are not visible in Windows. So what is this? \nSecondly, there is category in Ubuntu named \"File system\". In that I have all sections like boot, etc, dev, root, run... so, now what is this? What is the relation between that devices and this file system? Where is this file system stored? \nWhen I am storing my C, C++ files in home/username--> then where is it getting stored? in which drive? like C,D or J of windows? I am getting confused with all this. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not use drive letters; it sees all of its available space as one large tree. It lists your Windows drive (which is called \"C:\" in Windows) as one of its \"Devices\", as you mention, but that is just a matter of convenience: in Ubuntu terms that is probably a folder called /media/long-complicated-drive-name/.The fact that you can see more files in Ubuntu than in Windows is more like a Windows trick: under Ubuntu you will see all files and directories, whereas Windows hides these from you.The boot, etc, dev, root, run etc. are system folders where you shouldn't store anything, and in most cases, the system won't even let you. Feel free to organize your own files in the /home/username folder. That one is comparable with the folder called \"username\" under Windows. Ubuntu does not care how and where you store things in /home/username, except for personal settings which are typically in folders starting with a \".\".\nFrom the Windows perspective, whether your Ubuntu system is stored in D: or J:, or somewhere else, is impossible to tell without more information.\n\nA: If you know your filename you can search where the mountpoint is with:\nfind / -iname <filename> 2>/dev/null\nThis will show you the full path for the file IF the windows disks are mounted to begin with. With the path in posession, it'd be an easy job of getting it done. However, if you need to verify the mounts you can do the below:\ndf \nIt should give you the mounted devices on the system. On my Ubuntu, the output is:       \n`ubuntu:~$ df\nFilesystem      1K-blocks      Used  Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/loop0       29496487   9139181   20357306  31% /\nudev              7659848         4    7659844   1% /dev\ntmpfs             1533884       920    1532964   1% /run\nnone                 5120         0       5120   0% /run/lock\nnone              7669416        80    7669336   1% /run/shm\n/dev/sda3        51199996  13263736   37936260  26% /host\n/dev/sdb2      1953382396 173874560 1779507836   9% /media/NeverDie\n/dev/sdc1         3916912   1260704    2656208  33% /media/CRYPTO\n/dev/sdd1        15617008        40   15616968   1% /media/E4D3-8E30\n/dev/sda5       874358780 670689976  203668804  77% /media/Warehouse\nubuntu:~$ `\n\nSo, you'd have to see if the expected windows unit is mounted. Else, you'll have to find the device (probably /dev/sd and mount it).\n\nA: Linux has a nasty tendency to be very confusing regarding drives in comparison to windows. The best way to figure out what drive is what is to use a partition manager and looking a the sizes like you where already doing. Disks is nice for that. Ubuntu is probably using two \"partitions\" or the drives that windows sees. One is likely a small disk for storing working memory if your RAM is full. the other is where ubuntu self is.\n", "Q: Access Xephyr session twice Ok ; so I've got a gnome-session running on Xephyr flawlessly .

I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed on my system, and I am using it as the sort of host OS allowing its version of GRUB to be the boot loader and allowing it to manage all of the grub configuration. When I run \"update-grub\" to update the grub config file with the newly installed operating systems it does that just fine, but I can't find any way to add custom things to these entries without editing the actual \"grub.cfg\" which it says not to do. \nThe customizations I am looking to add would be things like \"quiet splash=silent\" for openSUSE in order to get its splash screen. Just adding \"quiet\" for Arch Linux, and adding \"quiet rhgb\" for Fedora in order to use its splash screen. I was wondering if there is any official way to do this other than editing the file it says not to edit?\n\nA: To add custom entries, the file you should edit is /etc/grub.d/40_custom.\nThe options are the same as in grub.cfg, but just in case here is a link with more info how to customize the file.\n", "Q: Ubuntu boot menu wont show up.

However, whenever I plug in a USB flash drive or an SD card, it seems to open in Shotwell. First I went to the \"System Settings\" and then \"Details\" and tried to adjust the default actions upon removable media being inserted, as I was almost certain that those settings would be pertinent to the issue. No settings changed the issue, at all.  If I right click on the Unity icon, and then click \"Open\" or even left click the Unity icon, it first opened in Shotwell, never Nautilus. Does anybody know what I could do to simply open removable media in nautilus once again, or at least have the option in Unity? The drives appear to be fully mounted at all times. I am able to access the drives by opening Nautilus, plugging in the removable media, and waiting for the removable media to appear in the left column, that works perfectly fine. The remaining issue is the automatic opening of Shotwell upon inserting removable media, and the lack of ability to open the device in Nautilus automatically or from Unity. All help appreciated!\n\nA: Try System Settings - Details - Removable Media and change all options to Ask what to do. Try having nautilus open when you insert the flash drive or SD card. It should appear in the left hand column as a removable ejectable drive and you can browse it normally.\n\nA: I actually just fixed it. Here was my solution.\nFirst, I edited the mimelist \nsudo gedit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\nand searched for any entries that started with inode/directory= and deleted them as pursuant to doug's solution regarding \"Unity links to USB drives do not open nautilus.\" Coincidentally, the entry linked to shotwell and looked something like \n\ninode/directory=...shotwell;\n\nThen, I installed Ubuntu Tweak via:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nand opened Ubuntu Tweak. \nUnder the File Type Manager (a mime list module) I went to 'All' and looked for the file type 'Folder'. This file type was linked to Disk Usage Analyzer, so I changed that back to Nautilus and everything worked normally. \nNo more opening in a random application by default, and no more failing to open in nautilus when clicked from Unity.

I've also noticed that clicking on the HP icon gives a menu with several options listed twice. \nI'm also often getting a communication error with the printer.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, printing through a CUPS server (also running Ubuntu). The solution to my problem was to remove the printer and re-install it on the client machine.\n\nA: The problem appears to have been fixed by the update to cups and various libcups packages, marked as 1.5.3-0ubuntu8.3, 1.5.3-0ubuntu8.4.

I'm not sure if this is truly a Ubuntu question, as it's more of a boot question (BIOS/CMOS perhaps). I have an existing Ubuntu v12.04 on one HHD drive. I don't want to partition that drive; not much room. I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a new SSD drive. I wish to use both systems at different times.\nNow I'm wondering if I can setup a boot selection of some kind. Would I just need to change the BIOS/CMOS boot order to load the version I wish to use? Does anyone know of a better approach? Thank you.\n\nA: Yes. GRUB will do it all. Simply install both drives in the machine.\nBoot from whichever one you want Open a terminal and run  sudo update-grub \n\nA: Your want your 12.04 grub in the MBR of the hard drive and the grub for 14.04 in the MBR of the SSD and set SSD as default boot in BIOS. (assumes both BIOS not UEFI).\nIf you used a default install both grubs may have originally installed to whichever drive is sda. And then on a major grub update will reinstall grub's boot loader to the MBR that is sda.\nTo see what drive grub2 uses see this line   - grub-pc/install_devices:\nsudo debconf-show grub-pc\nsudo grub-probe -t device /boot/grub\n\nto get grub2 to remember where to reinstall on updates:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nEnter thru first pages,spacebar to choose/unchoose drive, enter to accept, do not choose partitions\nThen follow Elder Geek suggestion on sudo update-grub. If you run that in both installs you can boot from BIOS or one time boot key and both grub menus will show the other. There are ways to add a default boot entry to boot link to most recent kernel so you do not have to update grub in both installs on kernel updates.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaintenanceFreeCustomGrub2Screen\n", "Q: analyse disk space usage of an encrypted home directory I'm having some problems with a full disk.\nAccording to df -k I'm using 47 gb of data in my home folder and I have no idea where all of that data is hiding.

Running Boot-Repair indicated that the problem was that the boot files were located far from the beginning of the disk and that the BIOS therefore had problems finding them. To remedy this, I created a boot partition at the beginning at the disk using gParted and Boot-Repair. However, this didn't solve the problem - not sure why. So I decided to start all over - i.e. merge the boot partition back into the partition with the Ubuntu installation and do a fresh install (\"erase and install\"). \nApparently, this made things worse. When I turn on the laptop, it simply displays \"Read Error\" (after the BIOS messages). My suspicion is that the Master Boot Record (MBR) got deleted during the partitioning. (I seem to remember that the first partition started at 1MB before I partitioned the drive, but now starts at zero). I have tried to restore the MBR with Boot-Repair (which is done successfully according to Boot-Repair), but when I then try to do the \"Recommended Boot repair\" afterwards it gives an error (also saying \"Please do not forget to to make your BIOS boot on sda disk!\"). The Boot-Repair URL log is here http://paste.ubuntu.com/7395389\nAny help is much appreciated - thanks.\nUPDATE:\nI have tried deleting all partitions on the drive using GParted and then installing Ubuntu with default setting \"erase and install\". Installation went well, but when the laptop is turned on it enters the \"grub rescue\". \"ls\" gives \"(hd0) (hd0,msdos1)\", \"ls (hd0,msdos1)\" gives \"(hd0,msdos1): Filesystem unknown\" and \"error: failure reading sector 0x802 from 'hd0'\".  Issuing the command \"ls\" and \"ls (hd0,msdos1)\" makes the laptop think for a while. After typing \"ls (hd0,msdos1)\" a second time, I got \"error: no such partition\".\n\nA: Use g parted magic usually on Hiren's Disc to delete and current os's on HDD/SSD and leave unallocated then install should be simple and fast.  \n\nA: It turned out to be a hardware error. I contacted Lenovo support and was guided through a series of tests including opening up the laptop and removing the SSD and reconnecting it. They send a new SSD (under warranty) and now it works perfectly.\n", "Q: Ubuntu, gtk 3.10.8, not able to visualize a menubar made by Glade My problem is that I've drawn a UI with Glade, but the menubar doesn't want to be drawn.\nHere is the xml, just a sample: please try to check out the properties.

Windows 7 is gone completely on the Acer and Ubuntu 13.04 or 13.10 does not start at all. I tried to make a Mac-bootable USB stick, but I cannot.\n\nA: I believe that the article that you want is: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\nBut in case you do not want to look it up, here it is:\nNote: this procedure requires that you create an .img file from the .iso file you download. It will also change the filesystem that is on the USB stick to make it bootable, so backup all data before continuing.\nTip: Drag and drop a file from Finder to Terminal to 'paste' the full path without risking typing errors.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu Desktop\n\n*Open the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/ or query Terminal in Spotlight).\n\n*Convert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil.  Example:\nhdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso\n\nNote: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically.\n\n*Run diskutil list to get the current list of devices.\n\n*Insert your flash media.\n\n*Run diskutil list again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2).\n\n*Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN (replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2).\n\n*Execute sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m (replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located; for example, ./ubuntu.imgor ./ubuntu.dmg).\nUsing /dev/rdisk instead of /dev/disk may be faster.  If you see the error dd: Invalid number '1m', you are using GNU dd. Use the same command but replace bs=1m with bs=1M.\nIf you see the error dd: /dev/diskN: Resource busy, make sure the disk is not in use. Start the 'Disk Utility.app' and unmount (don't eject) the drive.\n\n*Run diskutil eject /dev/diskN and remove your flash media when the command completes.\n", "Q: How to open youtube video with youtube-dl Ok so I found this answer to someones question about how to download youtube videos via youtube-dl.

Again, thanks for your help.\n\nA: You can specify the directory where the video will be saved using the -o option.\nExample:\nyoutube-dl -o \"/home/<User>/Downloads/%(title)s\" {URL}\n\nThe syntax to open any file in its default application is:\nxdg-open $file\n\nIf you are using VLC player, you can use so:\ncd /path/videos\nvlc \"Videoname.avi\"\n\nIf VLC Player is not installed, you can install it so:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:videolan/stable-daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\n\nA: Ok I found the answer. As Lucio stated, you double click on the file, I just didn't know where to find it to do this, and it is in the home folder. \n\nA: Perhaps the best way to set the location of all of your downloaded files is to set this from within youtube-dl's configuration file which can be located as $HOME/.config/youtube-dl.conf. Syntax is:\n--output \"~/media/%(title)s.%(ext)s\"\n\nand of course change the path to suit your needs (and the extension template details if you wish). Otherwise youtube-dl will simply download the requested file in the working directory. This will only work with relatively recent versions of youtube-dl so it would be best to update your copy before trying this with the following command:\nsudo youtube-dl --update\n\nNow you will be able to easily find your downloaded files and play them back with VLC, SMPlayer or whatever your favoured media playback application is :)\n", "Q: Can I Dual boot Windows? I have Ubuntu already installed on my computer that I just bought, and I have a copy of Windows 7. I like the feel of Ubuntu, and plan on trying it out, but I have many Windows-specific applications. \nSo, my question is, is it possible for me to dual boot Windows from Ubuntu. I understand people usually dual boot Ubuntu from Windows, but I have it the other way around. What do you suggest, or is this possible?\n\nA: Sure you can, but Windows is known to disregard installations of other operating systems.\nYou will probably need to edit the Windows 7's Boot Configuration Data (BCD) to add the entry for Ubuntu. The easiest way is to use a BCD editor like EasyBCD: www.softpedia.com\nAfter installing Windows, install EasyBCD and add the entry for Ubuntu.\nThis will make a dual-boot system but will still use the Windows' Boot Manager. If you would like to use GRUB as a boot manager, you can find more info on reinstalling GRUB here: help.ubuntu.com\n\nA: Yes it is possible.  See here\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n\nA: Yes, you can dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 7 even if Windows 7 was installed first.  The answer here is very good.\n\nA: Yes it is possible and the steps are listed on this thread. \nHowever if you just want to use windows for a couple of hours to finish some work using a windows specific application and don't want to see any kind of booting issues then I suggest you to go for virtual box. You can install virtual box in your Ubuntu box and then Install windows as a guest OS. The only catch here is you need to have more RAM. If your PC have more than 4GB ram then definitely you can try this\n", "Q: Mcrypt extension is missing in 14.04 server for mysql The php mcrypt extension on ubuntu 14.04 shows that it is installed properly, but phpmyadmin says:\n The mcrypt extension is missing.

What if I do that in Linux? By linux I definitely mean Ubuntu.\nFor downvoters:\nI don't want to update my ubuntu everyday, I only want to update to major long term supports, what is my liability? \n\nA: Failing to apply updates regularly will cause your machine or devices to be more vulnerable to recently-discovered security flaws.  Take the recent Heartbleed vulnerability for instance: if you weren't watching the news and you didn't update, any SSL-protected resources may have their private keys stolen.\nIf you're only running your desktop machine on your LAN behind a good firewall, there's less risk than in other scenarios and the Heartbleed example becomes a little drastic.  On the other hand, you're more vulnerable to viruses and malware if you're not regularly applying updates.  Viruses targeting Linux are less common than those targeting Windows, but I think you should still be careful.\nAt the end of the day you have to be the judge of whether or not you are willing to take the security risk involved in not regularly applying updates, because only you know the sensitivity of your data and how important it is to you to keep it private.\n", "Q: How to install GNU Parallel in Ubuntu 12.04 with my firewall?

If it does, then you can backtrack the things you have installed or any settings you may have changed. \nI recently had the same problem caused by incorrectly adding an environmental variable in my .profile. If you are in fact able to get into the guest account, use the terminal to ssh into your user account and start troubleshooting. \nssh my-user@localhost\n\nGood Luck\n", "Q: How to setup OpenVPN Client I'm trying to setup OpenVPN using NetworkManager. The GUI seems buggy and unresponsive. Are there any other tools for setting up a VPN client?\n\nA: Easiest method is running this command:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n\nAnd then add a OpenVPN connection from Network Manager which after above command supports importing .ovpn files.\n\n\nA: Install OpenVpn\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n\nThen go to Network Settings > Edit Connection > Add > Select VPN Point to Point Tunneling Protocol > Create\nAdd Username, Password and Gateway \nThen go to Advanced Menu\nCheck Use point to point Encryption\nSave\nThen go to Network Settings > VPN Connection and select that VPN connection and connect it.\n\nA: As Louis has explained installing openvpn client can be done with command\nsudo apt-get install openvpn\n\nHowever if you are using dual authentication mechanism for your vpn server, simple connection with\nsudo openvpn --config /path/to/config.ovpn\n\nwill not be sufficient. You need some extra setup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your config file has auth-user-pass line.\n\n*Next add --auth-retry interact to your connection command. So your entire command would look like\nsudo openvpn --config /path/to/config.ovpn --auth-retry interact\n\n\nA: Yes, you can use OpenVPN directly. This way you can use more settings as well.\nFirst you need the openvpn package:\nsudo apt-get install openvpn\n\nThen you can connect like this:\nsudo openvpn --config /path/to/config.ovpn\n\nThe sudo is important because OpenVPN won't be able to connect otherwise (I think because it has to change the routes).\n\nA: I'm coming here from the locked How to setup VPN using an .ovpn file? [duplicate], because I wanted to give an answer to problems of importing *.ovpn files in the GUI, which some users experience.\nJust like others, I've made sure to install:\n$sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n\nHowever, on Ubuntu 18.04 (had same problem on 16.04), I've not been able to import a *.ovpn file using the GUI (Settings -> Network -> VPN + -> 'Import from file').  I always get:\n\nCannot import VPN connection\nThe file \"foo.ovpn\" could not be read or does not contain recognized VPN connection information\nError: the plugin does not support import capabilities\n\nHowever, I just stumbled upon the following instruction from nixCraft for importing a *.opvn file:\n$ sudo nmcli connection import type openvpn file /path/to/foo.ovpn\n\nAfter running that command, my VPN connection gets listed under 'Settings -> Network -> VPN'.  After editing the password, my VPN connection works.  The VPN connection is also listed in top-panel menu that shows connections, power, users among other things.\n\nA: If you don't want to involve Network Manager, this git repository has a simple script that does the whole job very well using an interactive session with less than half-a dozen questions. See docs in download. \nhttps://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install.git\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18, install network manager with the command: \nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n\nThen...\n\n\n*\n\n*Reopen Network settings\n\n*Retry importing file\n\n\nThe import should work fine.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a separate drive I am wanting to use Ubuntu for daily use and my programming contract work (basically everything except for gaming). Right now I have Windows installed on a 64GB SSD and all of my Applications/Docs/Videos/Games/etc are installed on a separate HDD. In a month or so I am going to be getting a couple of new drives so i can get stop using two different drives for one OS (it just really bugs me having them separate for some reason). \nI have already read this article and this one. However, I am asking a more fundamental question, should I do this?\nWill I have a better experience doing it a different way?\nSo I was just considering re installing windows onto my HDD and then using the 64GB SSD for Ubuntu. Would that be an unwise decision on my part? Most Ubuntu installation tutorials I see either discuss installing as a partition or on a USB. So I am a little hesitant.\nWhat do you all think? If it sounds okay, are there any tutorials out there for doing what I am talking about?\n\nA: First of all, from my own experience it is possible to install Ubuntu on a SSD drive, and it actually works quite well.\nMy Laptop had a 32GB SSD drive and a 500GB HDD that I wanted to split between Ubuntu and Windows.\nI ended up installing Ubuntu on my 32GB SSD drive and splitting the HDD drive between the Windows installation and a media drive for Ubuntu.\nUbuntu boots really fast now, and working with the HDD drive is seamless, so I'm quite happy with the results. However, Windows' performance was cut down because I gave it a relativity small part from the HDD drive.\nShould you do it?\nIt really depends on how you use Ubuntu and Windows relatively. If you just want Ubuntu as a lightweight OS that can be booted quickly then installing it on a 64GB drive, even without a media drive for heavy files, should be fine. That way you can give Windows the whole HDD drive like you suggested.\nPlease note that the performance improvement may be negligible, and installing an OS on a SSD drive does have its own risks. So you may want to think twice before deciding to play with an SSD installation.\nIf you decide that you do want to install Ubuntu on the SSD drive, then the  answer here  might guide you:\nDo I need Intel Smart Response when installing Ubuntu? \n", "Q: wifi connection slow and weak on ubuntu 14.04 I am pretty new to ubuntu so please bear with me,\nSo basically I installed ubuntu14.04 on my Samsung 900x laptop, and the wifi signal becomes very weak and I couldn't connect to the internet at all, but the wifi on my Mac is fine.

I assigned 10GB for swap space and 90GB for Ubuntu itself.\nWhenever I try to install Ubuntu I get an error saying:\nUnable to install GRUB in /dev/sda Executing grub-install /dev/sda failed. This is a fatal error.\n\nAlso in details I get the following message:\nubuntu kernel: [ 1946.372741] FAT-fs (sda2): error, fat_get_cluster: invalid cluster chain (i_pos 0).\n\nubuntu grub-installer: error: Running 'grub-install --force failed.\n\nCan anyone suggest a solution?\n\nA: I think that your file system is not so good.\nSo I suggest you check your file system via using following command.\nsudo fsck.vfat -a /dev/sda2\n\nWhen /dev/sda2 is mounted, you must unmount it with following command before use fsck.vfat command.\nsudo umount /dev/sda2\n\n\nA: During the install, did you set a partition as the EFI boot partition?  If not, that is most likely the issue.  Here is the procedure I used (and recommend) when installing any Linux distro to dual boot with Windows 8.1.  In order to use this procedure, Ubuntu will need to be on a UEFI bootable media (such as a GPT FAT32 UFD, a DVD/CD, or other media that is UEFI supported).\nIf you want Ubuntu on the same disk as Windows 8.1, here are the steps I had to go through:\n1) Turn off Windows Fast Boot\n2) You need to shrink the main Windows 8.1 partition.  This can be tricky, as Windows expects a certain partition scheme to be used.  Let me show you a diagram:\n[(Windows RE Tools)(EFI System Partition)(Microsoft Reserved Partition)(Windows 8.1)(Anything else)]\nYou can use your favorite tool to edit these partitions.  I prefer Gparted, but any good disk partitioning tool can handle this.  Backup your Windows install first.  Then, resize the Windows 8.1 partition so that you have enough space for another OS.  I prefer to give any Linux distro about 100 GB of space.  \n3)  Download your Ubuntu iso and put it on some media (CD/DVD/USB/(insert your preferred media here)).\n4) Shut off Secure Boot and Fast Boot in the UEFI.  DO NOT TURN ON LEGACY BOOTING (if your motherboard supports UEFI only booting without Secure Boot and Fast Boot on.)\n5) Insert your install media and install Ubuntu in the space you left.  Make sure that for your EFI boot partition (you can select this in the partitions menu), you make the installer use the EFI System Partition already created by Windows 8.1.  The partition should be something like sdx2, but this could be different.  DO NOT REFORMAT THIS PARTITION!!  You are only going to tell the installer to use it as the EFI partition.  It will put the grubx64.efi bootloader for Ubuntu in this location.  \n6) With that done, continue the install as normal and set up your partitions as you see fit.  Once the install is finished, you should be able to boot into Ubuntu easily.  \nIf you are trying to fix an existing install of Ubuntu (that was installed in UEFI mode), you will need to do:\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi-amd64\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx (x being the drive Debian is installed on)\nsudo update-grub\nFrom there, the UEFI should use Grub-EFI as the bootloader. I have not found a way to get the Windows 8 bootloader to see and allow Debian to boot.  YYMV.\nAt this point, I think I have re-wrote (aka copy/pasted) this procedure about four times.  I should probably just make a wiki at this point.\n", "Q: Should I backup some files if I upgrade 12.04 to 14.04 ? Currently I'm using Ubuntu 12.04. I would like to upgrade to 14.04. Should I backup  some important such as those of the web root folder ? If I would need so,  how should I proceed ?\n\nA: A lot of settings are stored in the hidden folders and files (names starting with ., use Ctrl+H to see them) in your home directory, so I'd make a backup of your home directory. Furthermore, with dpkg-query -l > ~/dpkg-list.txt, you save a list of the programs you installed. You can use it to reinstall these programs after you installed 14.04 on a clean disk/partition.\nOn the other hand, I believe you can simply update to 14.04 by means of the Update Manager without having to worry about the home directory and packages.\nThis question is a duplicate of http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu by the way.\n", "Q: Is it possible to produce an ISO image of my current installed Ubuntu OS?

The vendor is derived from the unique MAC address of the card: the first 6 hexadecimal digits determine the vendor. To translate these digits to the vendor name, arp-scan uses a table stored in /usr/share/arp-scan/ieee-oui.txt. So to hack your arp-scan output you will need to reverse engineer the ieee-oui.txt table and add your own line with the MAC address and whatever text you want to show up.What you probably want though, is a list containing IP addresses and hostnames. The arp-scan command will not give you that.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Compiz taking lot of CPU resources I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop on a virtual machine with 1.5 GB of RAM and 20GB hard-drive.

I have seen many files which have this line as the first line in them. What exactly is this?\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nWhat does it mean? Why is it necessary?\n\nA: It's not just /usr/bin/env python but #!/usr/bin/env python and this line is called a shebang.\nI'm quoting Wikipedia:\n\nUnder Unix-like operating systems, when a script with a shebang is run\n  as a program, the program loader parses the rest of the script's\n  initial line as an interpreter directive; the specified interpreter\n  program is run instead, passing to it as an argument the path that was\n  initially used when attempting to run the script.[8] For example, if a\n  script is named with the path \"path/to/script\", and it starts with the\n  following line:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nthen the program loader is instructed to run the program \"/bin/sh\"\n  instead (usually this is the Bourne shell or a compatible shell),\n  passing \"path/to/script\" as the first argument.\nThe shebang line is usually ignored by the interpreter because the \"#\"\n  character is a comment marker in many scripting languages; some\n  language interpreters that do not use the hash mark to begin comments\n  (such as Scheme) still may ignore the shebang line in recognition of\n  its purpose.\n\nIn my case (13.10 Desktop), /usr/bin/env python will default to python2.7 but it could be python3.4 depending on your system defaults (e.g. 14.04 Server).\n$ /usr/bin/env python\nPython 2.7.5+ (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:37:08) \n[GCC 4.8.1] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> \n\n\nA: A line like this can appear on the first line of interpreted programs or scripts. It is a directive to the program loader to pass the file to the interpreter - in this case Python.\nInterpreter directives are placed on the first line of an executable script after the characters #! (called a shebang or hashbang) so that a script can be executed by just the script name, in one of the following ways from the command line:\n$ script\n$ ./script\n$ path/to/script\n\nTo be able to execute the script in this way like a command, it must have execute permission.\ninstead of the interpreter with the script name as an argument which would be required if the interpreter directive was not there, like thus:\n$ python path/to/script\n\n\nA: #! is called shebang. Normally, Bash considers the symbol # as a comment, however upon seeing #! Bash knows that the rest of the content should be a script and the first line will refer to which program or interpreter to invoke. In the case of #!/usr/bin/env python Bash knows that this line is invoking the correct \"environment settings\" for the Python interpreter. Thus the rest of the file's content will be run using the Python interpreter. Had the line been like #!/bin/bash or #!/usr/bin/perl Bash would have run the content using Bash (itself) or Perl respectively.\nYou can still write a Python, Bash or Perl script without mentioning this line. In that case to run your Python script you'd need to invoke from command line this way:\n/usr/bin/python MyScript.py\n\nThis is because without shebang #! and without a correct interpreter path, Bash would not know it's a script and would treat it as a text file.\n", "Q: How to Recover My Windows 7 files Unfortunately i did replace windows7 with ubuntu os . my hard drive is formatted please help me any one to recovery my files  \n\nA: This is almost impossible.

Try to copy the same file to your HOME directory.\ncp /etc/skel/.profile ~/\n\nHow i know this information?\n$ locate .profile\n/etc/skel/.profile\n/home/avinash/.profile\n\n\nA: There is no reason to copy the default if you don't want to. You can simply create a new, empty .profile and add this line there:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/empreinte/\n\nAvinash's approach is also correct of course, the files in /etc/skel are the defaults and you can copy the template file from there. It is just unnecessary since you can create it yourself.\nIn any case, I would recommend you create a new folder where you want to keep your own binaries and add that to the $PATH instead of keeping ffmpeg in your $HOME:\nmkdir ~/bin\nmv ~/ffmpeg ~/bin\n\nThen, edit your ~/.profile and use this line instead of the above:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/empreinte/bin\n\n", "Q: Broken Windows flashdrive after sudo cp I copied a PDF file on Ubuntu to my Windows-formatted flashdrive with\nsudo cp file.pdf /mnt/sdb4/\n\n(I am not sure if /mnt/sdb4/ was the path though).\nNow I can't access the drive neither from Windows nor from Linux(it doesn't appear in My Computer).\nI don't want to format it as there were some important files on it.

(Or, maybe, someone knows a better regex to get the link from the first code box)\n\nA: Here are some simpler approaches to get what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*grep with PCREs\nwget -q -O - \"serverlink\" | grep -oP 'flvurl=\\K[^;]+(?=&amp;)' \n\nExplanation\nIn PCREs, the \\K means \"discard everything matched until here\". The -o option to grep means \"print only the matched portion of a string\". So, grep -oP 'flvurl=\\K means: \"look for flvurl= and start matching after it.\" The [^;]+ means \"match as many non-; characters as possible. \nThe foo(?=bar) format is called a positive lookahead. It is not part of the actual matching string. It means _\"match foo followed by bar but discard the bar. Putting all this together, the regular expression above will print everything between flvurl= and &amp;.\n\n*sed\nwget -q -O - \"serverlink\" | sed -nr 's/.*flvurl=([^;]+)&amp;.*/\\1/p' \n\nExplanation\nThe substitution operator (I use the traditional s/// instead of the s\\\\\\ you used but its the same idea), will substitute everything with the text between flvurl= and &amp;. The parentheses are there to \"capture\" the matched string, making it available as \\1. The -r option enables extended regular expressions which can deal with parentheses without needing to escape (\\( and \\)) them. That's the reason you were getting the error by the way.\nThe -n suppresses normal output, no lines will be printed by default. The p at the end of the substitution (s///p) means \"print the current line if the substitution was successful\".\n\n*Perl\nUsing the same logic as the sed above:\nwget -q -O - \"serverlink\" | perl -ne 's/.*flvurl=([^;]+)&amp;.*/$1/ && print' \n\n\nA: Your command line is piping the output of wget into sed - in order to substitute the result of the sed command as a URL argument on the wget command line, you will need to do something like\nwget -q -O- -- $(echo -n \"urlstring\" | sed -e 's/pattern/replacement/')\nor\nwget -q -O- -- $(sed -e 's/pattern/replacement/' <<< \"urlstring\")\nThe -e may be omitted in this context.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty with UEFI + Software RAID1 How to install Ubuntu on UEFI BIOS with Software RAID1?\nShould there be 1 partition for EFI and another partition for RAID1 (root+swap) on each drive?\nI wonder how it will update one EFI partition to the other if it's not in RAID1 mode?\nWill the update-grub-efi command will update both EFI partitions on both drives like the one in legacy BIOS by using only the update-grub2 command?\nI'm using Intel Serverboard S1200V3RPL motherboard with Xeon E-1275 V3 processor.

BUT, in case you recreate the partition (that was my case), DO NOT change the UUID on those files, it's better to change the new UUID of the partition for the previous one it had with:\ntune2fs /dev/{device} -U {uuid}\n\nA: I've had this problem for a while. Recently I decided to verify checksum for the distributive (I found some mention of that in other problem solution). But md5 was correct. \nWhat finally helped me, was clearing my kubuntu live cd flash and creating new one with unetbootin. 10 minutes for fresh install and everything is up and running. \nSo my suggestion is do a foolproof check before any other investigation.\nI hadn't done it before just because Try Kubuntu worked absolutely fine from my flash drive. And I got through installation without any issues/errors/warnings.\n", "Q: configuration for ufw to allow upnp between desktop and xbox360 I am really stuck with this question.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04\nI cannot enable UFW to allow a connection between my desktop and Xbox 360 stream media when UFW is enbaled.\nThe connection and streaming works perfectly when UFW is disabled.\nI know that the network IP address of my Xbox 360 is 192.168.0.20\nI would appreciate it if someone could share the code I need to apply to enable streaming with UFW enabled.\nI have reviewed UFW documentation etc and find the examples either confusingh or not relevant to my use case\nAppreciate any helps that can be offered\n\nA: Try to allow all traffic from xbox to pc.\nsudo ufw enable    \nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.20\n\n", "Q: dual boot with windows 7 ubuntu 14 not working I have 3 hard drives on the PC:\n1st drive: 1 TB with windows 7 and 3 partitions.\n2nd drive: 500 GB Data.\n3rd drive: 40 GB and drive empty where the ubuntu installed itself.\nPerfect, now I restart PC only windows boots... \nno ubuntu?\nam I missing some kind of boot manager?\n\nA: try EasyBCD. it's an aplication for windows to change the bootloader settings.  i've seen some functions of it, but i haven't tested it yet. \n", "Q: ubuntu installation alongside vista to uninstall vista later if I decide to install ubuntu alongside vista, in order to try it first, can I disintall vista afterwards?\n\nA: Yes.

If you simply want to copy the .MP4 files to it in order to play them on a computer or a hardware player with MP4 support, you can use the preinstalled program named Brasero, or you can even do it in File Manager.\nIf, however, you want to create a video DVD that can be played by any hardware DVD player, you'll probably first need to transcode the files to DVD compatible MPEG-2 with MP2, AC-3 or PCM Audio, then master a DVD image and burn it using the appropriate DVD-video compatible UDF filesystem.\nTo save you a lot of reading, I'll put the probably most simple answer right at the beginning: While writing this, I stumled across Bombono (available in Software Center). I don't have any experience with it, but it seems to be a single tool that does everything you need (transcoding, mastering, and even burning).\nNow to the gory details, if you want to do everything by hand ;-)There are plenty of video transcoding tools available for Ubuntu. I personally use mencoder (available in software center), although, since it is a command line utility, it might have a rather steep learning curve. But don't fear, the documentation for mencoder is excellent (and by the way worth reading, no matter which transcoding software you use, since it also has some tips on how to get the best quality at a certain bitrate).\nOnce you have a suitable MPEG2 file, you'll need a DVD mastering software. The tool of choice for this task is dvdauthor (again: available in software center). To use it directly is pretty cumbersome, since it requires the whole DVD menu structure written as an XML file. Nevertheless, there are several frontends available for it (see the respective website - I only have experience with qdvdauthor, which is rather outdated and therefore no longer available in software center...).\nAfter you've prepared the files for your DVD, you need to burn them with a DVD-video compatible UDF filesystem. The easiest way to do this is to use k3b (did I mention Software Center yet?) as DVD writing application and to burn your project as Video-DVD (of course, this can also be done on the command line, see man growisofs and man genisoimage).\n", "Q: Run a script on detecting modem My problem is I am not able to run script automaticlly when modem is connected.\nI need a code to be run when my modem is detected. I am having a photon modem and I am using sakis3g script to connect to internet. I have to run sudo sakis3g connect in terminal to connect my modem. I have made this code to run without password by editing sudoers list.

I dont know whether I missed anything.\nThanks \nEdit. It is working.... No changes were made. Problem was delay was a little more that made me think not working. Thank you \n\nA: Your problem is probably that sakis3g is not in a default location. Modify your script to use the full path. For example, if sakis3g is in your $HOME/bin folder, make your script look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 6\n/home/bibi/bin/sakis3g connect\n\n\nA: It is working. Whatever steps I followed was correct. No changes were made. Problem was delay was a little more that made me think not working. \nAlso it was running without any notification.  Normally a window will pop up with 'connecting' dialogue when I run sakis3g to connect internet. No notifications like 'connected' also I  am  getting as showed in question. \nBut on plugging modem it is  getting connected automatically to internet in few seconds. :)\nThank you\n", "Q: How to install Digikam on Ubuntu 14.04? It seems that Digikam was removed from Ubuntu 14.04. Why was that?\nConsidering that Digikam is the only photo organizer which works with geo-tagged photos, what would be the best way to install Digikam in Ubuntu 14.04?\nNote that trying to install or search for Digikam turns up nothing:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo aptitude search digikam\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ \n\nAlso, clicking the .deb from UbuntuUpdates opens the Ubuntu Software Center which states that the dependencies for Digikam cannot be satisfied.\n\nA: digiKam 4.0 is out! if you'd like, install or upgrade it from PPA (14.04 only):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:msylwester/digikam\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install digikam\n\nPPA: https://launchpad.net/~msylwester/+archive/digikam\nvia: this quick tip\n\nA: Do you have your universe repos enabled?\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and I can see it:\n$ apt-cache show digikam | grep Filename\nFilename: pool/universe/d/digikam/digikam_3.5.0-0ubuntu10_amd64.deb\n\nTry enabling the Universe repositories:\n$ software-properties-gtk\n\nThen leave the \"universe\" repositories option checked\n\nClick \"Close\" and allow the packages info to be updated.\n", "Q: How to replace spaces with newlines/enter in a text-file?

Each line is stripped of its trailing newline, split into words, and then rejoined into one string where each word is separated by newline.This is done to ensure having one word per line and avoid multiple newlines being inserted in case there's multiple spaces next to each other. Eventually we end up with list of strings, which is then again joined into larger string, and printed out to stdout stream. That later can be redirected to another file with > out.txt  redirection.\n\nA: Try the below command\nawk -v RS=\" \" '{print}' file\n\nOR\nawk -v RS='[\\n ]' '{print}' file\n\nExample:\n$ awk -v RS=\" \" '{print}' example\nabc\ncdef\nghi\njk\nlmnopq\nrst\nuv\nwxyz\n\nExplanation:\nRS (Record separator) is an built-in awk variable. In the first command, the value given to the Record separator variable is space. Awk breaks the line from printing whenever it finds a space.\nIn the second command, the value given to the RS variable is space or a new line character.This command eliminates the extra blank line appeared while running the first command.\n\nA: You can use xargs,\ncat example | xargs -n 1\n\nor, better\nxargs -n 1 < example\n\n\nA: Similar to the 'tr' above but with the additions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Also works for tabs\n\n*Converts multiple spaces or tabs to 1 newline\ntr -s '[:space:]' '\\n' < example\n\n", "Q: Restoring higher resolution after installing ubuntu 14.04 with nomodset I've installed ubuntu 14.04 on my Thinkpad T420 which has Nvidia optimus GPU, using nomodset option but after installation I'm not able to get the full resolution.

How can I bring those default windows back?\n\n\nA: rm -r ~/.gimp-2.8\n\nWhen gimp starts again it regenerates this directory, and you'll get gimp fresh and clean :)\n\nA: For GIMP 2.10, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click TAB, or\n\n*Windows menu → untick 'Hide Docks'\n\n\nA: To open a new Toolbox, just hit Ctrl+b.\n\nA: I have also had the tools disappear, especially when working with email attachments other docs.

But this is pretty much the nuclear option, rarely useful for just a missing dialog.\n\n\nA: Since you recently installed GIMP and closed the Toolbox window, I would suggest to reset your window preferences because it would also restore the dockable dialogs and the Layers windows which is extremly handy when working with GIMP.\nNavigate through Edit menu → Preferences → Window Management → and click the button for Reset Saved Window Positions to Default Values. Then click Ok to close the Preferences dialog and restart GIMP.\n\nI would also suggest to enable the single-window mode so that all these windows would be docked inside the GIMP's main window and ease the workflow when working with it.

I think my installation of Ubuntu Server and Jenkins was succesfull. I can access the Jenkins page by internet from any computer. So now I want Jenkins to access my private gitrepo on BitBucket.com. I have found this tutorial: Configuring Jenkins Git Tutorial and I am stuck with step 3.5. With says do this: \ncd /srv/jenkins/jobs/project/workspace\ngit config user.email \"some@email.com\"\ngit config user.name \"jenkins\"\n\nBut with the first command I get the error: \n-su cd: /srv/jenkins/jobs/project/workspace: No such file or directory\n\nDo I have to make this folder?

But I don't know the meaning of :a;$!N;s/\\n/string/;ta within the single quotes. I know the middle part s/\\n/string/. But I don't know the function of first (:a;$!N;) and last (ta) part.\n\nA: These are the, admittedly cryptic, sed commands. Specifically (from man sed):\n\n: label\n              Label for b and t commands.\nt label\n           If  a  s///  has  done  a successful substitution since the last\n                input line was read and since the last  t  or  T  command,  then\n                branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.\nn N            Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.\n\nSo, the script you posted can be broken down into (spaces added for readbility):\nsed ':a;  $!N;  s/\\n/string/;  ta'\n     ---  ----  -------------  --\n      |     |        |          |--> go back (`t`) to `a`\n      |     |        |-------------> substitute newlines with `string`\n      |     |----------------------> If this is not the last line (`$!`), append the \n      |                              next line to the pattern space.\n      |----------------------------> Create the label `a`.\n\nBasically, what this is doing could be written in pseudocode as\nwhile (not end of line){\n    append current line to this one and replace \\n with 'string'\n}\n\nYou can understand this a bit better with a more complex input example:\n$ printf \"line1\\nline2\\nline3\\nline4\\nline5\\n\" | sed ':a;$!N;s/\\n/string/;ta'\nline1stringline2stringline3stringline4stringline5\n\nI am not really sure why the !$ is needed. As far as I can tell, you can get the same output with\nprintf \"line1\\nline2\\nline3\\nline4\\nline5\\n\" | sed ':a;N;s/\\n/string/;ta'\n\n\nA: I post this answer since I see a lot of confusion about why the last line is excluded when executing N (through the line addressing string $!) and because the OP was confused about the meaning of :a;$!N; in a sed command, not only in the specific one he posted.\nWell, the benefit of using $!N instead of N is not evindent in the examples proposed (by the OP and by @terdon), since no \"important\" (keep reading) command is performed on the last line after the N command. (Indeed, the result is the same if one strips that line address off.)\nIn a more complex example (for instance, substitute this sentence in a file, with the two words appearing sometimes on one line and some other times on two lines), excluding the last line for the N command could be crucial! If the last line is not excluded, upon executing N on it, sed hits the EOF and exits immediately, preventing all subsequent commands (branching commands as well, namely t and b) to be executed.\nIn the too simplistic examples shown, we can safely remove $! and let sed fail in executing N and return since the aborted s command would do nothing if it was executed, since there's no \\n to match.\n", "Q: Cloning with DD command How can I backup a partition (not the whole disk) to another partition on an external hard-disk using DD? \nI achieved this with the following command:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda6 of=/dev/sdb3 bs=1M \n\nHowever my requirements are:\n\n\n*\n\n*I need to backup /dev/sda6 and store that as an image (.img) file in /dev/sdb3 \n\n*Preferably as a compressed (.gz) image file (this is actually what I am trying to achieve)\n(Here are my foolish attempts that, obviously, didn't work: \nsudo dd if=/dev/sda6 of=/dev/sdb3/backup.img bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror\n\nsudo dd bs=1M if=/dev/sda6 | gzip -c > /dev/sdb3/backup.gz\n\n\nA: Unless /dev/sdb3 is actually mounted on /dev/sdb3 ( I doubt it, please research a bit on devices and mount points), you'd need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out where /dev/sdb3 is mounted.

I usually find it easier and more useful to back up files using rsync or something similar, then if needed compressing the resulting backup directory. But this is really up to you.\n\nA: What you want to do involves 3 simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a disk file\n\n*Copying data from partition into the disk file\n\n*Compress the disk file\n\n\n\nCreating a disk file\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount and CD to the partition where you want to keep a disk file\n\n*Use fallocate to create and preallocate blocks to a disk file. It's much faster than creating a file by filling it with zeros using dd or other tools. To specify the disk file size you can use MB/MiB/GB/GiB prefixes. For example if you want a disk image with size 50 GiB, you do\n$ fallocate -l 50GiB part_backup.img\n\n*Format the disk file. In this example, I use ext4 and disable journaling feature because there's no need for it in this case\n$ mkfs.ext4 -O '^has_journal' part_backup.img\n\n*Now that we have our disk file ready, mount the disk file with losetup. Pass --show option to it so it prints the loopback device that your disk file is mounted to, eg /dev/loop0\n$ sudo losetup --show -f part_backup.img\n\n*Create a mount folder in /mnt and mount the loopback device to the folder\n$ sudo mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/my_disk_file\nCopying data from partition into the disk file\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the partition that contains files you want to backup and identify the mount point\n\n*Use rsync to copy the files into the disk file you just mounted.\n$ sudo rsync -avzPSX /mnt/media_partition/ /mnt/my_disk_file\n\n*Please look up what each of those rsync opts does in rsync man if you're unusure. Also read the note about trailing slash in backup source\nCompress the disk file\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount the disk file as per normal\n$ sudo umount /mnt/my_disk_file\n$ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0\n\n*Use gzip to compress the disk file\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts not working anymore in xfce Although everything was working perfectly well, keyboard shortcuts like Alt+F4, Alt+TAB, etc. have suddenly stopped working in my Xubuntu 14/Xfce4 installation.\nNothing happens if I hit them, and oddly, if I try to close a terminal by Alt+F4, the letters ;3S get written in the console.\nOf course, the shortcuts in \"Settings>Window Manager>Keyboard\" are all correctly configured, and I have checked in xev that the keys are still mapped correctly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Output of ps -ef | grep xfce: http://pastebin.com/R44JZBP5\n\n*Output of cat ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xmlhttp://pastebin.com/GY7NzxCV\nWhere could this come from ?\nEDIT: I localized the problem: it comes from xmodmap:\nI have a .Xmodmap file in my home folder, containing only\nkeycode  21 = asciicircum dead_grave dead_circumflex dead_grave dead_tilde dead_ogonek dead_tilde\nkeycode  77 = NoSymbol NoSymbol NoSymbol\n\n(so nothing related to Alt).

Then the new mapping will be stored in the config.\n\n\nA: This seems to still be an active issue. I found a solution for Studio Ubuntu 14.04 that should work for other xubuntus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set your file manager to \"show hidden files\"\n\n*Navigate to ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/\n\n*Open xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml in a text editor\n\n\nLook for two lines:\n\n\n*\n\n*<property name=\"<Alt>Tab\" type=\"empty\"> should be first\n\n*<property name=\"<Alt>Tab\" type=\"string\" value=\"cycle_windows_key\"/> has to come after that\n\n\nYou could search on \"Tab\" to locate these more quickly. If either of these are missing or they are out of order or the wrong value is assigned, then the Alt-Tab function will not work. Fixing a missing value assignment got my computer working right again. (I had disabled Alt-Tab while working with Inkscape and could not get it back again until I did this).\nBe careful in there!

It will always render a white background but can also be styled with TextFieldStyle:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\nimport QtQuick.Controls 1.1\nimport QtQuick.Controls.Styles 1.1\n\nMainView {\n    width: 400\n    height: 300\n    backgroundColor: \"black\"\n\n    Column {\n        spacing: units.gu(2)\n        anchors.centerIn: parent\n        TextField {\n            placeholderText: \"ask\"\n        }\n        TextField {\n            placeholderText: \"Enter text\"\n            text: \"ubuntu\"\n            style: TextFieldStyle {\n                textColor: \"black\"\n                background: Rectangle {\n                    radius: 5\n                    color: \"gold\"\n                    implicitWidth: 100\n                    implicitHeight: 24\n                    border.color: \"#333\"\n                    border.width: 1\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIt will look like the screenshot below:\n\nSource: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qml-qtquick-controls-styles-textfieldstyle.html\n", "Q: Monitor randomly reboots - could it be Ubuntu fault? Recently bought a new widescreen display/TV combo for my Ubuntu system. It has a weird issue that when viewing huge colorful images fullscreen (or close to full screen) display reboots - turns off, displays logo and continues to display whatever it was displaying before. Sometimes I can get into infinite reboot loop. Tried connecting it through HDMI<->DVI and VGA - results are the same. Also tried using integrated video card - it still crashes.\nHas anyone seen similar issues? Is it possible, that this is a defect of PC/OS combo, but not display?

If the problem doesn't persist it's related to your current system and the manufacturer of your screen is right. If it does persist, then:\nContact the manufacturer again or contact place of purchase.

Bluetooth needs to be unblocked for the led to be on.\nrfkill block bluetooth\n\nThis will turn the led indicator off, and vice versa. Doing the same for WLAN doesn't affect the led indicator. The issue was having bluetooth blocked on startup, which then caused WLAN and Bluetooth to have opposite status. Using the function key for Wi-Fi would flip the status of both Bluetooth and WLAN.\nrfkill unblock bluetooth\n\nBlacklisting, but unblocking Bluetooth on startup, was a desirable solution for me.

According to man ssh, -A is supposed to forward local authentication, so it should be able to use sudo on the remote server..\nWhat am I doing wrong/not understanding..?\n\nA: SSH authentication and sudo authentication are two different sets of credentials. The -A option to the ssh command applies to SSH only. It provides the ability to forward your credentials so you can ssh from server to another system using your local SSH key.\nUnless you have sudo rules allowing you to run commands with no password, it will always need to prompt for your password, either from your shell's terminal or using an askpass program, if so configured. An askpass program is a (typically graphical) helper program that simply prompts for a password securely. To authenticate with sudo remotely, you will have to do one of the two things it is requesting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you have a tty so sudo can securely prompt for your password on the server. This is as easy as logging in with ssh -t.\n\n*Tell sudo to prompt for your password using an askpass program with the -A option on sudo (not to be confused with the -A option for ssh!). This can be done in your script, for example, with something like:\nexport SUDO_ASKPASS=/usr/lib/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass\nsudo -A ...\n\nNote that since you are piping your shell script to the standard input stream of the SSH connection, sudo will be unable to securely prompt for a password. If sending the script over the SSH standard input like this is a requirement (instead of just copying the script to the server), then the first option will not work. You will have to either use an askpass helper program or configure the required sudo rules to use NOPASSWD, if that is an option.\n\nA: Your premise that -A will help sudo is wrong unfortunately. It merely forwards the ssh-agent. You will have to run askpass like the warning suggests.\nAlso note that bash -c is not needed. You can simple pipe in your script with ssh server < mylocalscript.sh\n", "Q: Is it possible to define a list in the terminal?

I am extremely new to using Ubuntu.  While I have a basic grasp of scripting for git/linux and scripting for windows, ubuntu scripting isn't super clear for me.\nI'm wanting to set up a wifi driver w/o having to install ethernet... wondering if that's even possible?\nDo you think there may be a way to download an installer from windows and somehow insert it into the Ubuntu partition?\nReally wanting to avoid using Ethernet, it would be a huge headache to resolve, and presumably open a can of worms to start disconnecting the wifi router, which is not actually my own.\nAnyways, based on some previous threads, it sounds like I need to try using lspci and lsusb, but I don't really understand those commands or what to expect thereafter.\nAny advice for getting wifi on Ubuntu/Wubi partitioned off Windows 7, without ethernet?\nAlso, I saw a youtube recommending I find out the chipset for my wificard?  Not really sure how to do that offhand? Suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks!\nedit: Worst case scenario, would it be possible to get the driver(if even needed) from win7 to usb stick to Ubuntu?\n\nA: Please download this file on any other computer: http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/l/linux-firmware-nonfree/linux-firmware-nonfree_1.14ubuntu1_all.deb Transfer it on a USB drive or similar and drag and drop it to your desktop.

Install on SSD and RAID 0/1 or LVM for HDDs? I would like to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my PC, but I'm uncertain on what would be the best for my setup. I have a 128GB SSD (Crucial M4) and two 500GB HDDs.\nCurrently I'm running Windows 8 where I have Windows installed on my SSD and with the help of Storage Spaces I have an additional 1TB D:/ drive.\nI kind of wanted a similar (or maybe a completely different but better) setup for Ubuntu. The system should be installed on the SSD (for performance reasons, obviously) and my Documents, Music, Videos, etc. should be stored on the two HDDs. \nI thought about using a software raid, as it is described in this AskUbuntu post, also with level 0 or 1 (I don't mind missing 500GB of storage, I don't need that much). I also heard about LVM, but even after researching for quite some time I don't know if would be useful for me and even if, I'm too insecure to set it up.\nNow I wanted to ask you for help. Maybe you have a similar setup or just know what would be the best alternative.\nThanks in advance for your help.\nEdit 1: I also have a 500GB external hard drive which I would use for backups.\n\nA: If I had your hardware, and was dropping Windows entirely as you mention in your comment, I would install the operating system on the SSD mounted at / and use the installer options to mount one of the 500GB drives at /home The 2nd 500GB HDD I would likely hold in reserve and mount as needed for backups. I think you'll find you have plenty of space and having a backup plan is always a fabulous idea. You can skip LVM entirely since it's not in your comfort zone and there are always easy ways to deal with outgrowing storage on a Linux system such as Ubuntu. \nFull Disclosure: I actually have 3 systems setup exactly like this.\nIn response to your edit regarding keeping the 500GB internal as a spare or mounting it when you also have a 500GB external that you are using for backup: I would still keep it as a spare and mount it as needed. Say you collect lots of pictures and video and discover one day that one of those folders is taking up half your space. You could mount the spare temporarily on /mnt/whatever, mv all the files from the overloaded folder to the spare drive and then unmount and remount to your original pictures or videos folder. end result is a seamless increase of space where you need it most.\n", "Q: Mounting a network folder on a local computer I'm trying to mount a folder from a different computer as a local mount on mine.\nBoth mine and the other computer (our home server) are Ubuntu, both running 14.04.

When installing Ubuntu you have three options.  The first two options is to allow Ubuntu to use some automatic configurations.  The third option \"Other\" will allow you to specify the partition to use.  If you specify a partition, the partition(s) that you specify will be the only one(s) that will be affected.\n\nA: 1) Tell the Ubuntu installer which partition to use. It will not touch any other partition.\n2) Install macchanger (or macchanger-gtk if you prefer a gui). Then\nmacchanger --mac=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX eth0\n\nWhy do you want to change the mac?

In the second attempt, even the installation of GRUB failed. What did I wrong?\nMy system is a dell inspiron 6000, and I'd like to maintain simple windows boot with the built-in hard disk. I installed a second HD in the dvd bay, and my idea was to boot from that HD with GRUB on a USB stick. When I remove the stick, the system will boot windows without loading GRUB at all.\n\nA: I suggest you have GRUB install to the MBR of USB stick.\nIf all else fails, Try boot-repair.\nBoot-Repair is a GUI application which can fix a variety of GRUB 2 problems. It can be used either from a LiveCD, its own CD, or during a normal Ubuntu session. In addition to providing a simple user interface, Boot-Repair also includes the ability to run a script to gather details of the system which can be used for troubleshooting help on various forums and IRC channels.\nPlease refer to the Boot-Repair community documentation for instructions on how to install and run this application available here\n", "Q: Start the Rsync daemon to synchronize a directory between two servers I want to synchronize a directory on the server A to a server B.\nOn the server A I created a file rsyncd.conf with the content:\nuid             = rsync\ngid             = rsync\nuse chroot      = no\npid file        = /var/run/rsyncd.pid\n\n[share]\n  comment = share\n  path = /etc/dirtosync\n  read only = false\n  list = yes\n  hosts allow = *\n  auth users = rsync\n  secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets\n\nAnd I created on the server A the file /etc/rsyncd.secrets with the content:\nrsync:rsync\n\nI also created on the server A  the pid file, and the user rsync with the password rsync.\nOn the server A, on the file: /etc/default/rsync I put the value RSYNC_ENABLE to true and I started the rsync daemon with the command:\n/etc/initd/rsync start\n\nOn the server A and the server B the owner and the group of the directory is rsync.\nI launched on the machine B the command:\nrsync -avzr rsync@<serverA>:/etc/dirtosync/* /etc/dirtosync/\n\nI also tried on the server A the command\nrsync -avzr /etc/dirtosync/* rsync@<serverB>:/etc/dirtosync/\n\nWith this two commands the result is the same: the files are synchronized just one time when I launch the command but after if I modify the files in the server A they aren't synchronize to the server B\nDo I have to do something else to keep the file synchronized?\n\nA: You misunderstand how rsync works. rsync does not automatically replicate changes - it is not like dropbox or similar software. rsync only synchronises files once each time it is run. If you want to synchronise more often, then put the rsync command in a cron script (eg. look in /etc/cron.daily). If you want something that automatically synchronises changes, like dropbox does, then look at a different project, such as Sparkle Share or ownCloud.\n\nA: You may also use lsyncd: https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd. I'm using so far and it's great for this.\n\nA: The rsync syntax you've posted works assuming you've omitted the machine's host name/IP, but does not use the rsync share you've set up.  To use the share, you would need to change your syntax as follows to use the share:\nrsync -av rsync@MACHINE-A::share/ /etc/dirtosync/\n\nHowever, that will still not set up a continual sync between those folders.  What you seem to be after is a bi-directional sync for those folders, which is something that you can either set up in the cron or start using Unison file synchronization software.\nUnison is not well maintained any more, and I have not used it myself, but I have heard great things about it.  It keeps track of changes to files made in a directory that you've set up for synchronization, and periodically copies those files over using rsync or another (configurable) method.\nIf you're going to go the rsync-in-the-cron route, you will want to use the -u option which tells rsync to only copy over the newer files.  You will run into issues with deleted files re-appearing with this approach, however.\n", "Q: Copying Folder while Preserving Permissions/Ownership Error: operation not permitted I am trying to copy a folder while preserving ownership. When I use the command:\nsudo cp -R -p /var/lib/mysql /newpath\n\nthe files copy but the ownership changes (my username becomes the owner on the new files) and I get an error message saying that cp: failed to preserve ownership for '/newpath/subdirectory' : Operation not permitted for each subdirectory and file in the copied folder.

Any file copied to a FAT filesystem will appear with default owner/group/mode attributes, depending on how the filesystem was mounted.\nIf you need to preserve these attributes, use a different filesystem. Most (if not all) Unix filesystems (ext*, ReiserFS, btrfs and a bunch of others) supported by Linux will work, so will NTFS to an extent (not strictly a Unix filesystem but designed with a certain degree of Unix compatibility in mind).\n", "Q: Which proprietary video driver do I need for a VTK Rad7K 64P graphics card?

I don't know but model number on box when I purchased card is VTKRad7K64P, my computer is running REALLY slow.\n![lspci]/home/doug/Desktop/ubuntu.JPG\n\nA: Your card is Radeon 7000, it's an old card (do not confuse it with the Radeon HD7000, which is a much newer card). Your card has been declared obsolete by ATI/AMD and is not supported by the proprietary drivers any more. The good news is that it should be supported by the open source drivers. See if hardware acceleration is enabled (from that page):\n\nTesting The Driver\nTo look for boot messages/errors, check\ndmesg | egrep 'drm|radeon'\nTo see your OpenGL information, you can run the commands below.

If I chmod 777 that file and re-run the unrar command it unrar's everything just fine.  If I delete everything, chmod 777 the folder and run the unrar command, I get the original error.  I could really use some help here.\n\nA: /media is owned by root and it can be modified only with superuser privileges. That means that, if you want to unrar, create or copy any file to that directory, you have to precede the command by sudo or launch the program you are going to work with, launched with gksu.\n", "Q: phpmyadmin connect using computer name? I use phpmyadmin to connect to a remote server for Windows machine.  I have to use the IP address and not the computer name.\nIs it possible to use the computer name to configure a connection to a remote computer?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to use the computer's name as long as it resolves properly either through DNS or has an entry in the /etc/hosts file.\nFor example, if the computer name is sql, you could connect to it using \"sql\" as the MySQL host to connect to if your DNS pointed sql.yourdomain.com to the IP address of the MySQL server and you had search yourdomain.com and domain yourdomain.com lines in /etc/resolv.conf.  If you're using Ubuntu Desktop, you should set this in the \"Additional search domains\" setting in Network Manager.\nIf you are not/cannot use DNS, you can add a line like so to your /etc/hosts file:\nx.x.x.x     sql\n\nwhere x.x.x.x is the IP address of your MySQL server.\nThe major drawback with going the /etc/hosts route is that if you have multiple machines it can be pretty inconvenient to manage the hosts files on all of them (which is one of the reasons DNS was created in the first place).\nI would definitely recommend going the DNS route.\n", "Q: Rotating a log file in my home directory on Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS I have a log file ircd.log in /home/irc.\nI want to rotate it daily at 00:00 and keep 7 days.\nI want the rotated log files to be saved as ircd.log.YYYYMMDD for example ircd.log.20140505.\nCan someone please tell me the package to use and also an example configuration for it based on this?

I was using Synapse in Ubuntu 13.10 with the hotkey Ctrl+Shift+SPACE. After updating to Ubuntu 14.04 I tried to use the same configuration, but after each reboot the configuration is cleared.\nI've checked the file ~/.config/hotkeys/synapse.hotkeys and seems to be OK:\n[hotkey:activate]\nOwner=synapse\nSignature=<Shift><Control>space\n\nHow can I make the hotkey available after rebooting my PC?\n\nA: I've also encountered this problem in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and searched exhaustively for this. Finally I found a workaround for this problem.\nThe way is to use a lightweight tool named xdotool to simulate moves and clicks of the mouse, and then assign a shortcut for it. \nThe step in detail is as followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and install xdotool via command sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n*Try figuring out the coordinates of the icon of synapse on top panel. Usually the coordinates of top left on the screen is 0,0 (X, Y). When you type the command xdotool mousemove 0 0 click 1 mousemove restore you will probably find the mouse move to the top left and click and then come back to the previous location. Then you can increase X depending on your own. On my computer the coordinates are 950 0 (may differ with resolution/notification area icons but won't vary much). \n\n*After successfully activating synapse via command line, we try to assign a shortcut for it. Search Keyboard via Dash and open it. In Shortcuts, add a Custom Shortcuts. Type the name whatever you like and copy xdotool mousemove X Y mousemove restore (X Y for your own) as the command and click Apply. Then you'll find it disabled. Don't worry, just click disabled and it will show new accelerator.. then type your own short keys on keyboard simultaneously.\n\n*Close the window and enjoy it :)\n\n\nA: I did have the same problem with the version found in the testing-ppa (ppa:synapse-core/testing). However, as stated in this bugreport https://bugs.launchpad.net/synapse-project/+bug/1288839  you can use the saucy salamander package from ubuntu 13.10 (https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/saucy/+package/synapse) which runs just fine on my ubuntu 14.04 installation.\n", "Q: Do something if a program is running Is there something you can type into terminal so that it will run a command if a certain program is running?  For example, if <Libre office is running> then sudo pkill <Libre ofice>.  \nEdit 1: So what I want to do is make an if statement in terminal that runs if a program is running and if it is not it does nothing, or does something else.\n\nA: \n\"what I want to do is make an if statement in terminal that runs if a\n  program is running and if it is not it does nothing, or does something\n  else\"\n\nTo determine if a program is running given its name, use pgrep.  To dosomething if LibreOffice's word processor is running:\npgrep soffice.bin >/dev/null && do_something\n\nSimilarly, to do something if LibreOffice's word processor is not running:\npgrep soffice.bin >/dev/null || do_something\n\nFurther, you can use these two in combination:\npgrep soffice.bin && do_one_thing || do_another\n\nOr, if things get more complicated, use an if statement:\nif pgrep soffice.bin\nthen\n    # command is running\n    do_one_thing\n    do_one_thing2\nelse\n    # command is not running\n    do_another\n    do_another2\nfi\n\nThe above work because pgrep, just like grep, sets a useful exit code.  If a process is found, it returns with an exit code of zero (which the shell interprets as logical true).  If not, it returns with one (the shell interprets any non-zero exit code to mean false).\nTo find out all the programs that are currently running (and hence what name to use as the argument to pgrep), run ps ax\n", "Q: Can't find desktop shortcuts I updated Ubuntu to 14.04 about two weeks ago.

I can go to Desktop in Files and they will all be there, they just don't appear on my desktop until I go to the Desktop file in Files. Does anyone know how to fix my problem?\n\nA: What exactly do you mean? If you mean that nothing shows up on your desktop,  no icons or anything, just the background,  then you should try my fix: install gnome-tweak-tool and click around until you find a toggle for icons on the desktop. It fixed my problem immediately (even though it took me hours to figure out this solution).\n\nA: Maybe i didn't understand your question.\nAnyway, did you see the standard shortcuts tab on Settings ?\nThey are on \n\nSystem Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n", "Q: lubuntu how to execute 2 commands in .desktop file?

Then change the Exec line of your .desktop file to point to it:\nExec=/home/my_username/my_wrapper_script.sh\n\n\nA: According to this source:\n\nThe Exec key must contain a command line. A command line consists of an executable program optionally followed by one or more arguments.\n\nMy understanding of the above being that the Exec key supports a single command and that command can only contain 1 executable followed by arguments for the executable.\nMy tests to combine commands:\nfirefox && gedit\nfirefox & gedit\nfirefox ; gedit\n\nresulted in the second executable being read as an argument which seems to confirm the text.\n\nA: Apart from calling an external bash script there is this option:\nExec=sh -c \"disper -d LVDS,VGA-0 -r auto -e -t right; echo Running other command; echo ...and an other one\"\n\n", "Q: KDE appearance broken after using systemsettings On Ubuntu 14.04 (Unity) I wanted to change some KDE appearance settings, so I installed systemsettings.

I then discovered that there were a couple of key powerpoint functions that I use regularly and could not replicate them in impress.

I'm running the KDE Desktop on Ubuntu 14.04LTS. Is there a way to make it recognize my KDE desktop as THE desktop during a KDE session? Currently, if I save a file to my \"desktop\" it's not on the desktop in KDE, but if I restart in Unity, there it is. It also causes issues with Live Wallpaper and such. I guess the best way to describe it is it appears that KDE Plasma Desktop is running ON TOP OF Ubuntu, instead of IN PLACE OF it.\nI'd rather not reinstall straight-up Kubuntu, because I'd lose all my configurations and probably some software, too. Is there some way around this?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: As Saiarcot895 states, the desktop is highly customisable in KDE. By default, you use it as widgets, one of which being the \"desktop\" widget. However, you can still use it as a traditional desktop.\nRight click the desktop, to select settings.

In general, you should only add PPAs that you know are reputable and well established or trusted.\nHow likely is a Linux system to be infected? Not too likely.\n\nA: I would say anything is possible which is why I recommend backups! :-D \nFrom my personal experience I can safely say that I've added numerous PPAs to my systems for well-known and desirable software and never had a security breach AFAIK. The worst thing I've ever seen happen to an Ubuntu system was a home page hijack. Easily solved by setting the homepage back to normal.

How do I do this via the terminal? \nExtra info: Running wine explorer /e opens \"home/.wine/\"\nThe steam prefix is located in \"home/.local/share/wineprefixes/steam/\"\n\nA: While I've never found any documentation discussing this my personal experiences have shown that Wine assigns different letters to each prefix, which I guess makes sense because when you install multiple versions of Windows for real there are certain circumstances that can result in each installation having a different letter drive rather than all using C:\\ (Eg: the use of logical partitions.) but it's still really weird. \nShort hand commands for Wine only seem to work for default prefix because the command assumes the use of C:\\ . When you install wine it creates a prefix and assigns it as C:\\ any additional prefixes you make may have different letter drives. You will need to find out which letter drive your 2nd prefix is using. Most likely D:\\ . \nOne way to be sure would be to copy cmd.exe from Windows (Not the Wine cmd.exe it doesn't work) to the prefix and launch it. It's located at C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe and it will read something like D:\\Users\\Username.\nExample Wine Command For Launching 7-zip:\nwine start 'C:\\Program Files\\7-zip\\7zFM.exe'\n\nKeep in mind that if the software installed within the Wine prefix is configured for a C:\\ setup but is running from a D:\\ configured prefix, then it won't run unless it's a simple program that doesn't need to look for other files or that uses %SYSTEMDRIVE% or a variant when searching rather than D:\\ . Wine really needs to provide a more in depth explanation of the multi-prefix feature, because clearly some odd stuff goes on.\n", "Q: Can't open viewport for graphics in NG Spice When running ng spice 26, after compiling, I can not plot the results.

At least I'm not seeing any information to that effect.\nAnd when I'm trying to find information on this, specifically to Ubuntu 14.04, I'm just finding information on using the xl toolstack. \nWhat am I missing here?\nIs the XAPI toolstack now integrated into other components (hypervisor, kernel, etc)?\nDid the XL toolstack replace XAPI completely?\n\nA: The Answer\nThe XAPI toolstack is not dead. It is in active development here: https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api\nHowever, xapi never really ran right(imo) on debian derivatives. That has been changing since xen became a linux foundation project. If you really want xapi on debian, then I'd recommend you compile the xenserver core referenced in the xen-api github readme.\nThere are a couple of things you need to know..\nFirst, some terminology,\nThe Xen Hypervisor is the thin layer that domains (or vms, referred to as dom0 or domu) talk to when they want resources. It is now part of the linux kernel, so it no longer requires a custom kernel to run. The hypervisor does not have a shell or any easy way to mess with it directly. It is generally configured and managed from a SPECIAL vm we call dom0, on which the toolstack is installed.\nThe Toolstack is a set of programs used to manage all domains on a host and to generally tell the Xen Hypervisor what to do. As you know, the primary toolstacks of choice are xe(XAPI/XCP), xl(xenlight/libxl), and xm(xend).\nThere exist other tools that talk to the various toolstacks and provide another layer of abstraction. The most well known of these is libvirt.\nNot too long ago(ok, maybe awhile ago), xen hypervisor development was taken over by the linux foundation, which opened up a lot of doors as far as development was concerned. The most important things that you need to know are:\n\n\n*\n\n*xm is going away. This limits your future-proof toolstack choices to xl(libxl) or xapi.\n\n*The xapi toolstack is working towards building xapi on top of libxl.\n\n\nOk, now to the effectively useful information. The differences between libxl and xapi.\nxenlight, libxl, the xl toolstack\nThe xl toolstack is effectively a command line tool to manage the xen hypervisor. It generally is given a vm .cfg file like the ones in the ubuntu archive (http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/xen/xm-debian.cfg) and turns them into running vms via xl create .\nIt doesn't manage the creation of filesystems on iscsi targets or lvm systems. It is pretty dead simple and if you are starting with xen, it is imho the best place to get started as you can get a feel for what xen is doing and why. Additionally, the config files are human readable plain text, and when something is misconfigured it's easy to figure out how.\nHere are some useful xl commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*xl list\n\n*xl console \n\n*xl info\n\n\nxe, xapi, XCP(misnomer, XCP is now known as XenServer, which is a full distro)\nThe xapi toolstack makes scaling xen vm deployment trivial. There are two parts to xapi, the xe command line tool and the xapi api which is accessible via rpc via a web interface. XAPI is what XenCenter talks to and is a fundamentally different experience from the simplicity of xl. With xapi, there are tools for managing lvm partitions, snapshots, remote storage, advanced networking, performance statistics, patches, etc etc etc.\nIt is much much more than a hypervisor toolstack in that it manages all parts of the host system. If you want to get used to xapi, the best route is to install Citrix XenServer and manage it from XenCenter. Once you get a feel for the GUI, ssh into your XenServer and start playing with the xe command. Everything, including the uuids that are associated with vms, are tab-completable and the help documentation is fairly complete.\nThe End\nIf you have more questions you can email me at b@ethe.us\n\nA: Clutsicus.\nI have a tutorial in the Ubuntu Forum, which I put together by going through the woefully inadequate material which you mention above. I'm afraid that it always has been very poor around XCP/XAPI, but I did actually manage to get it to work.\nI Updated my tutorial today after attempting a fresh install on 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr), Because it is now broken. Here's my comment:\n\nBroken: Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) on Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (Trusty\n  Tahr)\nUpdate 28th May 2014:\nI was today in the process of installing a new XCP visualisation\n  server and found that the xcp-xapi package is missing from the repo.\nA brief look at xcp-xapi 1.3.2-15ubuntu2 (amd64 binary) in ubuntu trusty\n  and “xen-api” 1.3.2-15ubuntu2 source package in The Trusty Tahr shows:\n\nStatus: Deleted\n\nand\n\n1.3.2-15ubuntu2 DELETED: Trusty pocket Release in component universe\n    and section admin.

As far as I'm aware, OpenStack and some others use\n  XCP on Ubuntu for their infrastructure and this would appear to be a\n  cynical method of getting them to switch to XenServer/CentOS.\n  Personally I'd like to stick with Ubuntu and also don't like the Idea\n  of switching to an inferior Xen Toolstack. Perhaps I aught to start\n  from scratch and learn to use KVM?\nIf anyone knows anything about this situation and if it is likely to\n  be remedied please let me know, I'd really appreciate it!\nI will endeavour to get xcp-xapi installed by other means and report\n  back as soon as I am able.

Does anyone know how to disable the multi-touch gestures for the touch-pad, specifically the application switcher and Unity launcher?\nI have a Asus C710 Chromebook with Ubuntu 14.04 installed natively. When I have more than two fingers on the touch-pad, which happens if i'm scrolling or editing, the application switcher and/or unity launcher take me away from the window i'm on. This has become an extreme annoyance, I have already disabled the application switcher in Compiz, but it still appears.\n\nA: From the terminal, run synclient to view all touch-pad properties.\nNow, according to the official touch-pad support docs in order for multi-touch gestures to work, the touch-pad property ClickFinger3 must equal 0. So we will do the exact opposite:\nsynclient ClickFinger3=2\n\n\nA: There are a couple of programs I know of that you could try:\nUnity-tweaks, sort of a standard catch-all for changing unity - it has an option for disabling two-finger scrolling\npointing devices:  I think this installed by default, and tries to modify options for the synaptics touch pads\n\nA: According to How can I disable arbitrary default multitouch gestures in Unity? and this more recent example, the annoying 4 finger Dash shortcut is hardcoded into Unity.

Please help and thanks in advance :)   \n\nA: In general sharing application binaries between different distributions is not possible without additionally adapting other aspects of our systems.  \nMost applications make extensive use of libraries shared with other applications to make the code lean. This means that whenever we run an application we need to make sure we have all libraries needed also installed. \nOn installation of a program our package management takes care to add missing libraries as a dependency. This will not be the case if we only pointed to an application binary installed in a different distribution. Amarok for example needs many KDE-specific libraries which will be installed in a KDE desktop but not in XFCE. In the latter case you'd need to install all those KDE-libraries there to be able to run Amarok. Then you could also install Amarok on XFCE in the first place. It will take a little more code but it will be considerably more stable then.\nIn addition, the file hierarchy and application settings format may differ between program versions, releases or distributions. Therefor we may already have issues if we only shared our HOME directory with a different release or distribution.\n\nIn summary, it is not a good idea to share application binaries or configurations between different releases or distributions.\n\nWhat people do if they wanted to run the same application on different desktop environments is they install just the desktop environments but not the whole distibutions (e.g. install Cinnamon desktop in Xubuntu or install Xubuntu desktop in Mint).\n\nA: Do you want the programs to share data across OSes?

I'm using full disk encryption, that is easily done using recent ubuntu installation images. I have a very strong password that I type in on boot to unlock the encrypted disk partitions. Is a strong linux login password needed if I have no network services running (I have a firewall turned on to reject all incoming connections)? It's really annoying to have to type in a 40+ character password everytime I lock my screen, like when I just want to take a 5 minute break from working and step away from my computer or leave it in the trunk of my car. I can't think of any way someone could do a very high speed brute force attack with just keyboard and mouse access. Is this true? If the machine is stolen, then someone can copy the disk and insert it into another machine, but if a very strong password is used on the full disk encryption, it seems like I am safe. Am I missing any possible hacking attempts? I am aware of a cold boot attack, but it seems to me like in this situation the length of the password doesn't really matter.\n\nA: I feel the question is a bit vague but yet it has some points . The lock screen and disk encryption protects you mostly from physical (if you can call them so) attacks , meaning someone being in front of your computer literally . As you say computers can be stolen , and we all know that some data can be valuable . But I think cold boot attack is the method that hackers take data from RAM when the power is off and the encrypted disk don't offer more security . So in that sense the length of the pass doesn't really matters. As for brute force attacks 10 characters (that isn't really a word ) maybe with special characters and numbers , that covers it in the most part . Also I hear that linux kernel can be modified to keep some of the encrypted data in the CPU rather than the RAM with patches like TRESOR . If you conclude something more please share .\n\nA: To answer your question: No.  Physical attacks are going to be in a number of categories:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attacking the offline harddrive: This is the only point of using super long passwords.\n\n*Attacking the offline RAM: This is the approach billybadass is discussing, and if it works, length of your password won't matter.\n\n*Attacking the computer while on using the normal interface: This is the point of locking your computer and your computer wouldn't allow billions of password attempts per second, so no point in super long passwords.\n\n*Attacking the computer while on through roundabout means: If someone is able to get around the normal login interface, like directly reading memory or CPU, your password length won't matter because your harddrive is already decrypted so they'd have full access.\n\n\nThis is why there is a very different standard for encryption passwords specifically versus your normal passwords.  If you're the only user you might consider a full disk encryption which is prompted for once during the bootup and then have an easier user password.\nAlso, keep in mind that having no network services running and blocking incoming connections doesn't make you immune from that vector.  You could download a virus accidentally which could send all your data to the attacker.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Stopping at Boot Screen So, I was installing some packages via Synaptic.

How does PCManFM know where to mount a drive? I have an external drive /dev/sdb1/ whose mount point I would like to change from /media/Media to /media/external, but I'm not sure how to tell PCManFM to do this. I could just turn off auto-mounting in PCManFM and do it via fstab, but then I'd have to hit S when booting without the drive connected.\nIs there a file where PCManFM sets the mountpoints so it remembers them for the future?\n\nA: Normally PCManFM mounts partitions to /Media/Username/Partition-Label. If you change the partition label it will then mount under the new name.\nEg: /Media/Username/Example could be changed to /Media/Username/Changed.\nSteps:\nStep #1\nIn PCManFM unmount the partition for your external drive by clicking the unmount icon.\n\nStep #2\nGo to the main menu, accessories, and click Disks.\n\nStep #3\nIn Disks click on your device (from left hand side menu), then under volumes click on the partition so it's highlighted, and then click the cog beneath it and choose \"edit filesystem\".\n\n\nStep #4\nChange the partition label as desired, and click \"change\".\n\nStep #5\nRe-open PCmanFM and you will see it mounted under the new name.\n\nScreenshot links are dead.\n", "Q: Driver installation stuck I am trying to install proprietary drivers for a printer (EPSON L355, driver: epson-inkjet-printer-201207w) on Ubuntu 14.04 by adding a new printer in Printers.\nThe installation is currently stuck and I have already hit the cancel button but nothing happens.\nMy question is, how to proceed when installation seems to be stuck?

I've only been using Ubuntu for two weeks and have been able to find answers to any problem I had, however this one defies my searches.\nI want to move a visible programme file (wallch) to a hidden directory ./config/autostart.  I have been able to enter this directory and the subject file is not there and I want to have this program start at bootup.\nCan anyone assist?  Thanking you\n\nA: In Ubuntu, if you want a folder to be hidden, its name must too start with a . (dot) - the same thing is true for files. For example to create a hidden dolder, let say .folder, in your home directory from terminal, you can use the following command from terminal:\nmkdir ~/.folder\n\nThen to copy a file to this hidden folder, you can use the following command:\ncp /path/to/file ~/.folder\n\nTo move a file in .folder:\nmv /path/to/file ~/.folder\n\nTo list the content of .folder:\nll ~/.folder\n\n(In Ubuntu ll is aliased to ls -alF in .bashrc file.)\n\nA: I'm a newbie in Ubuntu myself, but maybe this will help you.\nGo to Dash, type in \"Startup Applications\" go there, you'll see a dialog and the list of programs that are on startup . \nClick \"Add\" button > \"Browse\"  \nand choose the program you want to be on startup.

So only for one time, just activate the feature that you want to use on startup, minimize and that's it.\nWallch will start this feature on startup.\nFor previous versions\nWallch -> Preferences(CTRL+P)->Start up options and enable the option you want.\n\nA: Try this command,\ncp /path/wallch /path/.config/autostart\n\n/path/wallch - path to the wallch file\n/path/.config/autostart - path to the autostart directory.\n\nA: Are you sure you want to copy it into /.config/autostart? That would stand for the .config folder of the 'root' account. For your account specifically the path should be ~/.config/autostart. Remember the 'tilda' symbol ~ stands for 'home directory'. For e.g. if your username is 'john', then ~ will point to /home/john and therefore ~/.config will be equivalent to /home/john/.config.\n", "Q: Tomboy Notes is not starting My Tomboy Notes is not starting. As soon as I start it, it gets closed. This problem started when I added a task in Tasque and the task importer plugin was enabled in Tomboy Notes and then just happened to open my Tomboy Notes and it crashed. \nNow I am using Gnote from few days, but I'm not satisfied. I want Tomboy back. What must I do in order to get Tomboy working again? Tell me how to reset it and as I have all the backups of my notes. Even removing it and reinstalling it will do for me. Tell me the procedure.\n\nA: You most likely have a note in your default note directory that has a wrong format and tomboy is crashing when it tries to process it.\nBy default, on Ubuntu, your tomboy note directory is located at:\n~/.local/share/tomboy\n\nSince you already have a backup of your notes, move the notes to a temporary directory such as:\n$ mkdir ~/.local/share/tomboy.store\n$ mv ~/.local/share/tomboy/* ~/.local/share/tomboy.store/\n\nAfter this, you will have verification that tomboy is crashing because it's having a problem with an ill formated note.  It shouldn't crash now, but should open up with no notes.\nNow systematically move note from the store directory to the real directory.  When you move the problem note tomboy will start to crash again.  When you learn the problem note, you can  eliminate that note and have a working tomboy.\nYou can copy your notes back 10 at a tome (or any number) by:\n$ mv `ls ~/.local/share/tomboy.store/*note | head -10` ~/.local/share/tomboy/\n\nYou may have to quit tomboy and restart it between blocks to see if it still crashes, or to help verify where the culprit note lies.\nBy the way, tomboy's notes are identified by the *.note extension.\n\nAlso, please note.  There is a bug with in Tomboy in that it will be confused with the timestamp of the note if you don't quit tomboy\n  between the moves (or copying of notes).  It will change the timestamp\n  of the note to the current time if you don't quit.  Quiting then\n  bringing in the new notes will preserve the correct timestamp.\n\n", "Q: Is there any command similar to qlmanage in Mac OS? Is qlmanage command is present in Ubuntu?

It will do a valiant job at trying to interpret that nothingness as a valid writer file, but the result will be pretty much as it is in the question.\nTo create LibreOffice files directly from nautilus or another file manager, you need to tell that file manager what a \"new\" LibreOffice file looks like.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open LibreOffice, and start a new document.\n\n*(Optional) Edit the fonts, etc. to be how you must often like them to be when you start a new document.\n\n*Save it in ~/Templates (that is, the Templates directory in your home directory) called something like \"New LibreOffice Writer Document\".\n\n\nNow when you right click in Nautilus you have the added option New > Document > New LibreOffice Writer Document.\nYou can also customise further.

That being said it will not upgrade 13.10 to 14.04. The do the full distribution upgrade, you will need to change your software repositories to 14.04.\n\n*If you run \"sudo apt-get linux-generic\", it will only upgrade the kernel. If you run \"sudo apt-get upgrade\" however it will upgrade all packages that have an update & it may include the kernel as well.\n\n*Technically speaking, yes, the kernel (Linux) is the operating system. That is why the upgrade option for apt-get is dist-upgrade which stands for \"distribution upgrade\". Kernel (Linux) + all applications make up the distribution. If you upgrade from Linux kernel version 3.12.x to 3.13.x, you have technically upgraded the \"operating system\", but you haven't upgraded your \"distribution\" which might still be Ubuntu 13.10 (and not Ubuntu 14.04).\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes. Upgrade leads to running the latest Ubuntu version. This\nassumes that you are upgrading from the version that was the latest\nbefore the new release (You are running 13.10 and latest is 14.04)\n\n*The upgrade may (and usually does) involve kernel upgrade. But not\nevery kernel upgrade is an OS upgrade\n\n*No. Upgrading kernel only upgrades the kernel.

By a commented line I mean either: \n#!/usr/bin/perl -w\n\nand the comments in /boot/grub/menu.lst file as described in this answer on superuser.\nIt already has a comment, i.e the line begins with a #, but still is being interpreted. Why is that so?\n\nA: The line beginning with #! is still a comment, in that it is not executed as normal commands.\nBut not only is it a valid comment but it's also a hashbang, a line that can be used to indicate the interpreter to be used to execute these commands if the script is called on its own.\nHashbangs begin with a # in order to be backward-compatible with interpreters that don't read hashbangs, in which case they will simply be interpreted as comments and ignored.\n\nA: Any line that begins with a # is a comment in many languages and is ignored by the interpreter (perl etc.). \nHowever, if the first line of a script in Linux begins with a #! (shebang as it is called), it is not a comment but a directive to the program loader to actually run the program specified after #! and pass it the name of your file as the last argument.\nFor example, if the first line is\n#!/usr/bin/perl -w\n\nit means the shell will actually invoke /usr/bin/perl -w /path/to/the/script and you don't need to specify a program to run this script, you can run it using\n/path/to/the/script\n\nif you have the permission to run it and it is located on a filesystem supported for execution and the file has the permission to be executed. \nFor the interpreter, however, this line is always just a comment, so if the script is  executed as:\nperl /path/to/the/script\n\nthen the line has no effect. (Thanks to Ruslan for pointing this out).\nBe warned that # is not always indicative of a comment. For example, a statement beginning with a # in C is pre-processor directive and not a comment.\nIn your case, the line is a comment and will be ignored while execution.\nUpdate:\nThe file you are talking about is a menu.lst for which a comment is a line beginning with ## and not #.

(I still received the same 5 minute delay with different error messages regarding NetworkManager.)\n\n*Killed NetworkManager before shutdown.\n\n*Added lines to the scripts in /etc/init.d to halt NetworkManager at runlevel[0]\n\n*Updated Kernel and other packages\n\n*Changed the order of shutdown scripts in /etc/rc0.d/ and reboot scripts in /etc/rc6.d/. \n\n*added acpi=off to /etc/default/grub (this was a long shot, but suggested on some forums for a similar problem)\n\n\nI think it's safe to say that ModemManager is not the culprit, and NetworkManager probably isn't either (killing it before shutdown doesn't help). Perhaps another program is trying to access the internet and keeps NetworkManager running.\nI believe the problem may lie somewhere in a fluid dynamics simulation package I have installed called the Weather Research and Forecasting Environmental Modelling System (WRF-EMS). Here are the instructions I followed to get it running on Kubuntu.\nI did a nearly identical install of Kubuntu 14.04 LTS on a different machine without the WRF-EMS package, and that machine shuts down in a few seconds with no delay. Furthermore, if I run the WRF-EMS before shutting down, sometimes I have no delay, but if I don't run it, I always experience the 5 minute delay. \nRemoving the WRF-EMS does not solve the problem, though, so perhaps the shutdown hang is only affected by the WRF-EMS, not directly caused by it.\n\nA: It's impossible to be sure without actually experimenting on the given machine, but it's most likely a service and quite possibly modem-manager.\nModem-manager is a package related to mobile broadband modems, so if you aren't using any of those, you could just remove it entirely.\nIf that isn't possible (because you do use it) or fails to stop the issue, then try shutting down some services manually before a reboot, and see if one of these results in a dependably faster (and error-free) shut-down.\nThat service is therefore the (or a) culprit. If you know you don't need it, you can remove it. Otherwise you can try setting kill timeout 1 to the shut-down parts of its script, though that takes a bit of reading up on the config files for the service in question.\n\nA: I had the problem with a fresh installation of Kubuntu 14.10: The Kubuntu screen froze during shutdown. My solution was to change the line in file /etc/default/grub to look like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash init=/lib/systemd/systemd\"\n\nAfter that run sudo update-grub in a terminal.\nNow the system shuts down again... hope this helps.\n", "Q: Sequence of files used when booting the Lubuntu 14.04 How can I find out which files the Lubuntu 14.04 in fact uses during the boot - from the very start when I turn ON the power.\nI'm new to this Linux world, but I think Lubuntu must have  list of configuration files it searches for - maybe finding them or not finding them.\nEspecially I'm interested in seeing what is going on BEFORE the logon dialog.\nI'm not interested in what ??ubuntu XX.YY did way back but what Lubutu 14.04 does right now on my machine.\n\nA: First the kernel boots, then it launches init, which uses the scripts in /etc/init.d/ to start up all of the system services. The final service to be started is lightdm which in turn starts xorg and then draws a login screen. man boot-scripts. The whole startup process, from boot loader to graphical login, is complicated, and understanding it all requires understanding how initrd works, how upstart works, how the individual init scripts work, how udev works, how xorg works, etc. Each subsystem has its own configuration scripts. \nDo not expect to be able to learn it all overnight - it takes years to become an expert. I would suggest you start by reading the scripts in /etc/init.d/ and playing around with starting and stopping them. Most of the configuration files are, in general, found in /etc/ - if you look in that directory, you will find many files, each with its own purpose, each installed by some software. To find out which package a particular config file came from use dpkg eg. dpkg -S /etc/locale.alias will tell you that file came from the locales package. Some of these files have their own man pages (eg. locale.alias), for others you will have to read the package docs or search the web.\n", "Q: How to add element to the gsettings array at the specific location (given by index)? I want to write a script that translates devilspie's window rules into compiz' rules. Compiz settings can be changed by gsettings keys in path org.compiz.profiles.unity.plugins.place. There are three keys: viewport-matches, viewport-x-values and viewport-y-values. Unfortunately each key is an array, and the index of the elements matters. \nGsettings lacks any support of array types other than rewriting whole array at once, and I need to place item in the array at the specific location (say, at the beginning, index '1').\nI know, that if I don't care about the index, I can use\ngsettings set ${schema} ${key} \\\"`gsettings get ${schema} ${key} | sed s/.$//`, ${value}]\\\"\n\n\nThe question complements How to remove element from gsettings array in script?\n\nA: The following python3 script will insert new element(s) at a given index:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport argparse\nimport subprocess\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument(\"schema\", help=\"gsettings shema\", metavar=\"SCHEMA\")\nparser.add_argument(\"key\", help=\"gsettings key\", metavar=\"KEY\")\nparser.add_argument(\"index\",\n                    help=\"KEY array index where VALUE(s) need to be inserted\",\n                    metavar=\"INDEX\", type=int)\nparser.add_argument(\"value\",\n                    help=\"gsettings VALUE(s) to add to the KEY array\",\n                    metavar=\"VALUE\", nargs='*')\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\narray = eval(subprocess.check_output([\"gsettings\", \"get\", args.schema, args.key]))\nfor v in sorted(args.value, reverse=True):\n    try:\n        value = eval(v)\n    except NameError:\n        value = v\n    array.insert(args.index, value)\nsubprocess.call([\"gsettings\", \"set\", args.schema, args.key, str(array)])\n\n\nA: You can also do this via a bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSCHEMA=\"your.wanted.schema\"\nKEY=\"your-wanted-key\"\n\nSTATUS=$(gsettings get ${SCHEMA} ${KEY})\n\n# Optional proof, whether value to add already exsists\nif [[ $STATUS == *\"'to.add.value'\"* ]]; then\n    echo \"to.add.value is already in the list!\"\nelse\n    gsettings set ${SCHEMA} ${KEY} \"${STATUS%]*}, 'to.add.value']\"\n    echo \"Added to.add.value to the list.\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: Unable to update my ubuntu server 14.04 using apt-get update I am unable to update my ubuntu server 14.04 using apt-get update. \nOutcome is:  \nW: failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/inrelease \n\nAnd another error is:\n/usr/local/snort/bin/snort: error while loading shared libraries: libdnet.1 : cannot open shared object\n\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: I just had this same issue.

Since then the integrated webcam is not working anymore. I tried to use it with Skype and Google Hangouts, but it says that no video device is found. I found some solutions but they did not work. \nFirst thing I did was to check if the integrated webcam is activated in bios settings. Then I found this \"How can I get my webcam to work with Ubuntu 14.04?\" but I don't have any /dev/video* device. \nCan anybody tell me what to do? Thanks.\n\nA: For proud owners of the Asus Zenbook!\nMy camera did not work after upgrading to Ubuntu 18.04.\nSo I ran sudo apt-get install guvcview and restarted my computer. And it works now!

Regards.\n\nA: The comment by user.dz on the original question provided the solution worked for me:\nsudo modprobe -r uvcvideo && sudo modprobe uvcvideo\n\n\nA: I finally figured this out. For the longest time, I just thought the web camera in my laptop was broken. It didn't even show up when doing an lsusb ...and it won't, because hitting the web camera function key on the laptop adds/removes the device in hardware as if it has been physically connected/disconnected.\nYou must hit Fn+<Camera Key> on your keyboard and then you'll see the following in your kernel logs:\n\n[22219.057985] msi_wmi: Unknown event received\n[22219.509572] usb 3-1.4: new high-speed USB device number 6 using ehci-pci\n[22219.646222] usb 3-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=5986, idProduct=055c\n[22219.646229] usb 3-1.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=3, Product=1, SerialNumber=2\n[22219.646233] usb 3-1.4: Product: BisonCam, NB Pro\n[22219.646237] usb 3-1.4: Manufacturer: Generic\n[22219.646239] usb 3-1.4: SerialNumber: 200901010001\n[22219.649336] uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device BisonCam, NB Pro (5986:055c)\n[22219.652486] input: BisonCam, NB Pro as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.4/3-1.4:1.0/input/input19\n\nHere is what the key looks like on my MSI WS-60. It varies from laptop to laptop. Hit it and you should watch /dev/video0 appear and disappear. \n\n\nA: You can try GTK UVC video viewer . This software is available in software center. Then go to Videos and select the device. I have two device connected with my computer. I keep my mobile device active, because of that in device it is showing Symphony FT45. In your case chose the default device. This might solve your problem. Have fun.\n.\n\nA: I had a similar problem - it will probably be solved when you update and upgrade your computer.\ntry this command:\nlsmod            \n\nIn this screen you'll find the devicename, its number, the third column means that your device activated or not (0 means not activated). See screenshot below:\n\nTo activate this device use this command :\nmodprobe <name of the device>\n\nyour kernel will run the activate automatically after rebooting.\nYou can also do it manually through this file /etc/rc.d/rc.modules\n\nA: In my case (Lenovo Ideapad Y500, elementaryOS) installing the following packages solved the problem: \nsudo apt-get install libsbigudrv2 libsbigudrv0\n\n\nA: Install webcam driver packages and needed software\nsudo apt-get install cheese build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\n\nA: If you change your display manager on Mint from mdm, to lightdm your sound and video won't work. I tried everything on any website but nothing worked. I just reverted back to mdm from lightdm and sound-video-webcam was back and running fine.\n\nA: I also ran into an issue where the integrated webcam was not detected (no /dev/video*), with similar symptoms to the 'disable camera button' responses above. My work laptop does not have that button, but there is a BIOS setting to enable the camera, which was off.\nI restarted and entered Bios Setup (F12) and for me the setting was under:\nSystem Configuration > Miscellaneous Devices > Enable Camera\nI didn't know this option even existed, hopefully this post saves someone some time.\n\nA: Look for a physical switch somewhere on your laptop if there is no key combination or BIOS setting to kill the camera. On my machine, HP Spectre x360 Convertible 15-df1xxx, this was a tiny, miniature, unnoticeable switch right next to the USB port. Seems I had accidentally bumped into it while upgrading the Ubuntu version using a USB stick. Seeing no key combo or BIOS option and finding no software fix, I was pretty convinced this was caused by the kernel upgrade.

Press ctrl+W and then enter the string you want to search. It will search for the string inside the file.\n^W      (F6)            Search for a string or a regular expression\n\n\nA: Try ctrl+g. You will get \nMain nano help text\n\n The nano editor is designed to emulate the functionality and ease-of-use of the UW Pico text\n editor.  There are four main sections of the editor.  The top line shows the program version, the\n current filename being edited, and whether or not the file has been modified.  Next is the main\n editor window showing the file being edited.  The status line is the third line from the bottom\n and shows important messages.  The bottom two lines show the most commonly used shortcuts in the\n editor.\n\n The notation for shortcuts is as follows: Control-key sequences are notated with a caret (^)\n symbol and can be entered either by using the Control (Ctrl) key or pressing the Escape (Esc) key\n twice.  Escape-key sequences are notated with the Meta (M-) symbol and can be entered using either\n the Esc, Alt, or Meta key depending on your keyboard setup.  Also, pressing Esc twice and then\n typing a three-digit decimal number from 000 to 255 will enter the character with the\n corresponding value.

The new unity entry does not seem to originate from a correct .desktop entry because all the submenus are missing from it (New incognito window, New Window etc.) and it has a permanent tag '(1) Facebook' no matter the window title (see attached picture).\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled chrome in hope that it would help which it did until restart but now I get the same behaviour.\nNote that I haven't altered any .desktop files regarding chrome and I can only find one file: \n/usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\nwhich seems to be correct (with submenus etc.) \n\n\nA: You will possibly also have a Chrome .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications. Probably when you type \"chrome\" in Dash, it will appear as well. Just remove the local one.\nAnother possibility, even more likely since it is called \"Facebook\", is that you have a (presumably local, in ~/.local/share/applications) .desktop file called Facebook, using Chrome. Webapps do leave a .desktop file. \nWhen looking for the right .desktop file to remove, it is good to know that the filename of the .desktop file can be different from the name you see in Nautilus (and Dash/Unity!); if the file is in /usr/share/applications, or if it is executable and in ~/.local/share/applications, the displayed name is defined in the Name= line of the file, and is different from its actual filename.\nEither which way, you must have mutiple occasions of desktop files, calling Chrome in their native command, That is: the command in the headsection of the desktop file (above the Actions= line). Look in both /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications for duplicates. If you are not sure you picked the right one to remove, open it with gedit, see what is in the line after Actions= If the defined shortcuts match the \"right\" version (New incognito window, New Window etc.), keep it. Another tip to identify: local .desktop files (in /usr/share/applications) show their icon if you make them executable. If you suspect a file, make it executable to see if the icon matches your \"secundary\" Chrome .desktop file.\n", "Q: VHDL compiler and simulator for Ubuntu 14.04 I am searching for good VHDL compiler and simulator. Which packages do I need to install? Thank you.\n\nA: I am assuming you are looking for a \"free\" compiler and simulator?\nAnd you are looking to target an FPGA design?\nI have had good luck with Xilinx ISE which supports Linux and has a pretty good reference manual so you can run via command line if you prefer.  This includes the ISim simulator which works fairly well, and has all the tools you would need with it.\nXilinx offers the ISE \"free\" but they basically degrade performance after you reach a specific design size.  There are full open source options available also, take a look at GHDL.\nHowever if you are looking to target a specific device you may want to see what the vendor offers; Xilinx ISE is obviously targed for Xilinx devices, Altera offers a free version of Quartus etc.\nIf you are willing to put some money into your development there are a host of Linux friendly vendor independent software available, check out Mentor Modelsim or Synopsys.\n", "Q: How to increase memory allocated to java? java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space I have an Ubuntu server 12.04 using a reverse proxy so that tomcat runs on top of apache.\nAnd I have a confluence instance on that machine, and a ticket system. So nothing special.\nMemory is 8GB that's more than enough for this use.\nFrom time to time, and in the last few days more often my confluence page crashes.\nThe log (confluence\\logs\\catalina.2014-05-06) shows this :\nSEVERE: Socket accept failed\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n\nSo how can I avoid this? How can I give that process more memory.\n\nA: In my system I have edited the file\n/etc/init.d/tomcat \n\nwith these rows\nHEAP=\"-Xms2048m -Xmx2048m\" \nexport JAVA_OPTS=\"$HEAP\"\n\nAfter restart tomcat you can see in the status section the memory allocated\n\nA: You can also do it in tomcat/bin/setenv.sh file and restart tomcat:\nexport JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms512m -Xmx1024m\"\n\n\nA: The reason for the error is due to the way Java allocates memory. Your applications are allowed to use only limited amount of memory. This limit is specified during the application startup. \nAllowed maximal size is set during the JVM launch by specifying JVM parameters such as -Xmx. If you do not explicitly set the sizes, platform-specific defaults will be used.\nSo – the “java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space” error will be triggered when you try to add more data into the heap space area in memory, but the size of this data is larger than the JVM can accommodate in the Java heap space.\nSo the obvious way is to increase (or add if missing) the maximal possible heap size specified via -Xmx parameter. But in many cases you are just hiding symptoms instead of solving the underlying problem. To see the full explanation of the java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error, check out the Plumbr performance tuning site.\n\nA: the answers didn't work for me, tried that and it worked :\nexport _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx4096m\n\n", "Q: Is it okay (or not) to symlink libraries to overcome \"cannot open shared object\" errors? Sometimes, for one reason or another, a program hasn't specified or included all its dependencies correctly, and starting it up results in errors indicating missing dependencies. A typical error is something like:\ncannot open shared object libudev.so.0\n\nI see a lot of answers advising people to work around such problems by making symlinks in /usr/lib or other system locations, and this does seem to often solve the problem. But I see an equal number of comments advising people that it's a bad idea. Here's one answer that's representative.\nUnder what circumstances is it acceptable to symlink a library to make a program work? Never? Sometimes? What if you delete the symlink after you finish running the program?\nWhat are the the consequences of doing this?\n\nA: The problem with creating these links is that they aren't managed in any meaningful way. If that library is removed, the link becomes broken. If the library is upgraded, it may encounter an error because of the link that it doesn't expect to be there.\nAlso, you are essentially lying to the system. In the linked example, you are pretending that libudev.so.1 is actually libudev.so.0. They are named differently for a reason (different versions of the library). While this may work just fine for some programs, there is the potential that differences between the versions could cause issues (such as a segfault or other unexpected behavior).\nSo if you are specifically creating this link just so a program will run, and you know that you will remove it later, you address the first issue but not the second. While this does address the primary issue, it is not ideal.\nThe ideal solution is of course to install the right version of the library (the accepted answer on your linked example), or to compile the program against the version you have.\n", "Q: Move/Rename a lot of files with specific file size I recovered a lot of pictures (1000+) from a bad SD Card. All except 75 which seems to be 'broken'. I ran a program to get all the pictures reading at a lower level and I found out I got all the pictures including the ones that are not readable in the SD Card, the problem is that they were recovered with different names and a lot are duplicated.\nI want to find the file (if there's more than one, just get the first) in the 'good' folder with the exact same size each file in the 'bad' folder has, and rename it with its name.\nI ran this command ls -lR | egrep -v '^d' | awk '$5==5040057{print}'\nand I got this result\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  5040057 Apr  6 04:47 _MG_2443.JPG\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 5040057 Apr  6 04:47 f11146176.jpg\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 5040057 Apr  6 04:47 f12072256.jpg\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 5040057 Apr  6 04:47 f14834560.jpg\n\nEdit: It doesn't show in the result from the command, but the folder structure is as follows:\nRecovery:\n |- Bad ( containing _MG_XXXX.JPG files )\n |- Good ( Containing fXXXXXXXX.jpg files )\n\nWhere the first one _IMG_2443.JPG is the bad image and any of the following are good (those are the candidates to be renamed or moved). So for the previous example I would like that for example file 'f11146176.jpg' to be renamed in the Good folder as '_MG_2443.JPG' so I can check it later and replace it on the bad folder.\nIs there a way to run a command to do that automatically for all the pictures? Thanks\n\nA: File size is not a good way of determining duplicates. You can have two files with the exact same size but different contents. This means that it is quite likely that this approach will fail. That said, the following will do what you asked for.\nImportant: this assumes your file names have no spaces and no new lines. \n\nfind bad -iname \"*.jpg\" -printf \"%s %f\\n\" | while read -r bs bf; do \n  find good/ -iname \"*.jpg\" -printf \"%s %f\\n\" | while read -r gs gf; do \n    [ $bs -eq $gs ] && echo \"mv good/$gf good/$bf\"; \n  done \ndone\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*find bad -iname \"*.jpg\" -printf \"%s %f\\n\" : find all files whose name ends in .jpg or .JPG in the bad directory and print their size and file name.\n\n*while read -r bs bf; do : read each line of the output above, saving the file's size as $bs and its name as $bf.\n\n*The second find ... | while ...; done does exactly the same for the good directory, saving the file's size as $gs and its name as $gf.\n\n*[[ $bs -eq $gs ]] && echo \"mv good/$gf good/$bf\"; : If the bad file's size is the same as the good file's size, rename the good file using the bad file's name. If this does what you expect, remove the echo and change the line to simply mv good/\"$gf\" good/\"$bf\". Note that this will keep the last 'bad' file name as the final name for the 'good' file.\n\nI want to stress that this is not safe, different files can have the exact same size and completely different contents. Instead of using this naive approach, you might be better off using a program that is specifically designed to compare images. I've never used any such software but a 3 minute search turned up DupeGuru. I suggest you try it first:\n\nDupeGuru : dupeGuru Picture Edition (PE for short) is a tool to find duplicate pictures on your computer. dupeGuru PE is a big brother of dupeGuru. \nThis software works like dupeGuru, but is specialized for duplicate pictures matching. dupeGuru PE runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.\n\n", "Q: apt-get in LXC container is very slow on Ubuntu Server 12.04 I haven't had much luck in finding out the source of the issue, whether this \"issue\" is simply a limitation of LXC or zfs, or whether this issue is specific to Ubuntu.\nThe issue is quite simply that apt-get is very slow when run inside a container. \napt-get hangs for about 30 seconds when reading package lists (after I've run apt-get update for example)\nReading package lists... 99%\n\nIt also hangs when installing new software.

It often boots to the Lubuntu splash screen for a few seconds and then displays what appears to be a black screen. After a while the monitor reports that there is no video signal. At this point the hard drive light flashes occasionally. The video does not respond to the keyboard and mouse. There is no response to power cycling the monitor (off then on). I even switched to PS/2 keyboard and PS/2 mouse to eliminate USB initialization problems but the problem happens regardless of whether the input devices are USB or PS/2. \nThis board is described as having the following video support: Integrated UniChrome Pro 3D Graphics. The BIOS seems to have a setting to specify AGP or PCI. Neither setting makes a difference and perhaps the setting applies to plug-in video cards, of which none are present.\nI have swapped monitors, keyboards, mice, and installed a voltage regulator. The problem persists. \nVery seldom does the Lubuntu login screen appear, but if it does, the unit is functional and was tested with Skype and Firefox, so I know the OS is present and common applications work.\nHow do I resolve this black screen problem?\n\nA: If the information at the link My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? with relevance to Ubuntu does not get the job done then perhaps the advice there about using the install menu's F6 to change the nomodeset option was not sufficient or the recommendation about using GRUB to also apply nomodeset was similarly lacking. \nThe answer in this post is specific to Lubuntu and contains no screen shots of Ubuntu that are not exactly what the Lubuntu user will encounter. This answer is specific to Lubuntu 14.04.\nThe tested recommendation that did succeed for this particular hardware is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot from the ISO image but highlight Try Lubuntu without installing. While it is highlighted notice that the cursor keys allow you to cursor (horizontally) through the list of configuration keywords. It might not be obvious. What is obvious is that if you can cursor through them you can edit them. Replace the words quiet and splash with the words nomodeset and xforcevesa. The nomodeset will cause the kernel not to set video parameters and leave it to other parts of Lubuntu. The xforcevesa has to do with forcing VESA configurations, probably in X support. \n\n*It might not be obvious that Try Lubuntu without installing will provide a way to conveniently install, so to merely \"try Lubuntu\" is not a waste of time. Once the edits have been made proceed to invoke Try Lubuntu without installing. In a little while, the desktop will show an icon that allows you to actually install Lubuntu. Right click it and invoke it. (Note that the selection Install Lubuntu back in the install menu (not to be confused with the desktop icon for installing) also allows horizontal cursoring and option editing and so it probably is the alternative solution. However, as suggested, to merely \"try\" was not a terribly inefficient route.)\n\n\nPerhaps it is not obvious but apparently the option edits that were done in step 1 will persist over shutdowns and reboots. \n", "Q: Font Hinting in Ubuntu 14.04 I'm in the process of switching from 12.04 to 14.04 on all of my machines.\nI'm a bit particular about font rendering and used the app \"unsettings\" to set font hinting to None on 12.04.

I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I have been experiencing the following issue with former releases as well.\nI am using a German keyboard layout. However, I am missing the key to display the pipe- / inequality-signs (which on German keyboards is supposed to be left to the Y key).\nI already tried to add or remove different German keyboard layouts using system settings but non of the layouts include this key. The best I could get so far is to have access to t he following symbols: » and «. However, these are not the appropriate German inequality signs plus the pipe symbol is missing.\nSee this screenshot of my German keyboard layout:\n\n\nA: It might be, that the wrong keyboard model is selected. To view currently installed keyboard model issue:\nsetxkbmap -print | grep geometry\n\nIf you see pc104 there you will have a 104 key layout where the > < | key is not defined. \nIn order to use a typical German 105 keys keyboard, you have to choose the \"pc105\" type, labeled \"Generische PC-Tastatur mit 105 Tasten (Intl)\" in the German localization of Ubuntu on installation. To change this later you can issue\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nor edit /etc/default/keyboard as root.

Nevertheless, since I don't use Unity or Gnome, I have no idea where the respective setting is hidden there (if someone knows: please update this answer).\n", "Q: Encrypt: Overwrite empty disk space bad for SSD drives? I am installing Ubuntu 14.04 and got the choices of:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for Security\n  \n*Use LVM with the new Ubuntu installation\n  \n\nIf I select Encrypt and go to next step, I get to write a password/passkey and then there is another choice:\n\nFor more security: [checkbox] Overwrite empty disk space\n\nThere are answers to what it does in this thread - For more security: overwrite empty disk space, i.e. overwriting unused space to make it more difficult to recover data. \nMy question is...\nIs this bad for SSD since it will then write more than \"needed\"?\n\nA: Not really. Using that option will cause a single write to every sector of the SSD partition that you assign to Ubuntu. Used sectors will get encrypted data. Unused blocks will get random data. This is the equivalent of a Windows \"Full Format\". Modern SSD drives are rated for hundreds, or even thousands, of terabytes of writes before any significant number of sectors get reallocated. See The SSD Endurance Experiment. Even the worst performing drive there was capable of enduring 140GB of writes per day for 10 years. The initial wiping of the drive (around 250GB for an average 2014 drive) will be insignificant in comparison to the total writes over the lifetime of the drive.\n\nA: Strictly speaking, yes, but not significantly. \nYes, all operations on an SSD impact on likely lifetime, and hence we should avoid doing anything that costs excessive pointless writes (like forcing a defrag), but worrying about it here is penny-wise and pound-foolish.\nIn answering the question of whether to overwrite the free space, the impact on SSDs is a point in the \"no\" colum, but it's a very, very, very small point. \n", "Q: Switching Java version through apt? (Apologies in advance if my formatting is off, this is my first post, please feel free to correct me).\nNormally, when I want to find out what version of java I'm using, I run:\njava -version\n\njava version \"1.7.0_55\"\n\nIf I want to change java version (from java 7 to java 6), I can just point the symlink (/usr/bin/java) to the corresponding JREs java binary. (We don't need to worry about the javac compiler or java_ws here, in this instance, btw).\n# readlink -f /usr/bin/java\n\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java\n\n# ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java /usr/bin/java\n# java -version\n\njava version \"1.6.0_31\"\n\nThis is fine, and as far as I can see, it works.\nIn Solaris, there is a nice way of doing this through the pkg mediator tool:\nmyHost# pkg mediator -H java\n\njava     system    1.7     system\n\nTo change Java from 1.7 to 1.6:\npkg set-mediator -V 1.6 java\nThen to confirm the changes\nmyHost# pkg mediator -H java\n\njava     local     1.6     system  \n\nI'm wondering does apt have an equivalent? Or is there a more graceful way of switching between java versions?\nEdit: This could also apply to python, so I'm not looking for java-specific answers\n\nA: The correct way of switching between multiple versions of an installed software is using:\nsudo update-alternatives --config <package>\n\nSo, for java, you need to execute:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\nwhich should return you the versions installed, which in my case is:\nThere are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).\n\n  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* 0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java          1053      auto mode\n  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1051      manual mode\n  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java          1053      manual mode\n\nIn order to switch between versions you can enter the selection i.e. 0, 1, 2 in this case, depending upon the version you want to switch to.\nHowever, in case of python, python2 and python3 are not alternatives, so you won't find this option, you will need to create aliases for this.\nSo, if you want python to refer to python version 2.xx and python3 to refer to python version 3.xx, you can open your ~/.bash_aliases file and enter the following:\nalias python=`/usr/bin/python`\nalias python3=`/usr/bin/python3`\n\nThis file may be empty if you have not created aliases before, which is fine. You may even want the alias the other way around, i.e. python to refer to python3 and python2 to refer to python2, you can tweak the alias as you want.\nAs you can see, it depends if the versions installed are alternatives of each other- if they are alternatives, you can use update-alternatives, if not, you will have to tweak using aliases or soft-links. There may be better, cleaner solutions, but I am not aware of those.\n", "Q: KDE, how to have \"tail -f\" constantly on a dedicated panel?

This will write the output of a command both to your terminal and to a file at the same time. To capture all output and errors from starting a server, run\nserver_cmd 2>&1 | tee /path/to/logfile\n\nTo read the saved output in another session, simply read the saved log file /path/to/logfile.\nAnother more flexible way is to use a terminal multiplexer program such as screen , tmux , or byobu . A terminal multiplexer allows you to attach to and detach from running terminal sessions. This gives you the ability to do view the output of running programs from more than one attached session, and much more.

I want to add that space but it needs to move it and then grow it . I know it will take some time but i'm more concerned about wheter it is safe or not. Most of my data is backed up, but before venturing i want to know if there's a real possibility that it will result in boot failure\n\nA: Yes, there is a real possibility. gparted has been tested on many systems and drives, but it does occasionally fail. Boot failure is not the worry, as grub can be reinstalled from a livecd. The potential problem is your partition table or file system being corrupted. You should regularly backup important data anyway, in case you have a drive crash, or house burn down, etc.\n", "Q: Can't use a new formatted partition after formatting with gparted. Permissions I guess Xubuntu 14.04. \nI had a non used partition, and as my /home has become full I have had to format that unused partition. \n(My desire was to merge that partition with /home as it is listed next to /home, but as home is in use I can't do it, I can't unmount it. Help with this would be much desired too, even prefered, should I use a live-CD?).\nSo I have formatted with gparted that new partition as ext4 and put a name/label \"home2\". When I launch gparted it asks me about the computers password, so I run it with privileges. \nThis new partition is listed in gparted as /dev/sda3.\nThen I open this new partition in the file manager (Thunar) but can't create folders or copy there. If I list its properties it says: \nOwner: Root\nAccess: Read and Write\nGroup: Root\nAccess: Read only\nOthers: Read only. \nSome help here.

How can I fix this?\n\nA: You must be trying to install from a live media. Ok now 1st thing you must try to do is restart your computer and boot into the pendrive again. If the problem solves well and good, if not try opening gparted if it reports an error it's May be a connection problem. Sometimes the files appear well and good but the partitions are not detected clearly. Try doing 'something else' on the installation see if there the windows boot loader written or not alongside any of the partitions.

What could be going on here?\n\nA: It may not be actual physically used RAM, but rather Disk Cache. Disk Cache is where any frequently used files are stored in RAM so they can easily be retrieved again quickly without needing to wait on the disk (which is way slower than waiting for RAM). You can usually tell how much RAM is actually used for apps using the second line of the freecommand.\nHere's an example:\n            total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:         12925       1221      11704         35         32        468\n-/+ buffers/cache:        720      12205\nSwap:            0          0          0\n\nIn this example I am physically using 720MB of ram of my 13GB, but with disk cache this amounts to 1221MB total. After a while my RAM usage will increase because the disk cache will increase, but the actual app RAM usage may not.\nI hope this better explains things. \n\nA: From your post : Cached:          3062088 kB\nThis is really not a concern. Your swap usage is very low. \nSwapTotal:      11719380 kB\nSwapFree:       11719068 kB\n\nThis means that the vast majority of work is being performed very efficiently in RAM\n", "Q: No Lubuntu 14.04LTS Unetbootin?

You will have a text window; move between options with TAB and choose with ENTER --- choose lightdm for Unity.\nThen you can restart it with \nsudo restart lightdm \n\nOld (but relevant) link here. \nIf it still does not work, try to reinstall the DM:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm \n\nand/or remove gdm: \nsudo apt-get remove --purge gdm\n\n(be careful with this one, if it asks you to remove important packages, do not do that --- you could end with an unusable system). \nPS: Have you ever modified some file in the lightdm/gdm configuration directories, to change login background or similar things? If yes, add that info in the question,  detailing what you have done (which files you have modified/added and how).\nThis is because if you modify some configuration file, when reinstalling or updating, the system will not delete or reset the file you changed. So if you want to go back, you have to undo manually what you did manually...\n", "Q: UPower reports Incorrect Capacity I've just replaced my old Netbook battery with a new one of higher capacity.  It was a cheap battery off of Amazon which clearly reads as a 5200mAh battery but Ubuntu reports the battery as being the standard 4400mAh battery that came with the system and that it has 99% of its capacity left.\nThis seems very strange but I have no idea how to directly confirm the capacity.  I've installed acpi and run:\nacpi -v\n\nThe returns the same information as UPower interface.  I've run:\nsudo fwts battery \n\nAnd the system reports the battery is fine for a new battery, though it does report a lack of ACPI events.\nIs there any way to manually set the capacity (I have to do this with my Android phone and the battery monitoring app I use) or force it so rescan the battery?\n\nA: It may be related to the problem that the manufacturer of the battery often does not disclose the specification of the battery, and for supplying a compatible - or at least almost compatible - battery, it's hard to build a correct 'battery chip'.\nI think it could well be that the battery has about 5200mWh electrical capacity, but the chip does not know it, because it was easier to find or build a chip reporting 4400mAh.\nThat would mean, it reports no more than 4400mAh no matter what you do, but gives you more, and the battery capacity estimation will have to cope with the inconsistent data somehow.\n\nThere may be interesting info if you take a look at what you find in /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1 or so - see\n Battery design capacity is zero?. Maybe add it to the question if it looks interesting.\n", "Q: Not able to connect to the internet using HUAWEI E303 datacard I followed the steps mentioned in the post.

I shouldn't have used the open source Xorg\n  driver instead of the proprietary Nvidia driver that seems to work\n  correctly.\n\n–  user278680 May 11 at 16:42\n\nA: I had the exact problem of disabled keys & mouse after resuming from suspend.\nI've managed to solve it by switching from default display drivers to the NVIDIA 331.38 drivers.\nyou can switch it easily on the HUD --> additional drivers.\nYou would need to restart after you make the change.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 14.10 on GA-H81M-D3H motherboard without any separate GPU, and it's frozen after suspending randomly. All that remains is the log-in screen that you can neither move your mouse nor enter the tty mode. I figured out that the problem happened every time I triggered the audio on the system. Then I went to the bios setup -> peripherals -> audio controller, and changed its settings from \"auto\" to \"enabled\". It's now working!\n\nA: I also had the same problem. Using HUD-->additional drivers, I was able to switch from the Xorg driver to the NVIDIA driver. (The number was different for mine than the 331.38 but this makes sense, I guess). Solved my problem of the login screen being frozen after waking from suspend. \n\nA: I've had a similar problem, after wake up sometime i could move the mouse but the GUI was freezed and only when i pressed CTRL+ALT+F1 i could use the terminal. Other times instead it freezed totally.\nAfter long research ( changing bios settings, grub settings, graphic drivers , DMs etc) i tried both lxde and gnome with metacity and both didn't had problems with suspend.\nSo i have to think that compiz is bugged with suspend mode. Try to use another desktop manager or change compiz with metacity if you can.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI've installed the latest nvidia drivers from here, \n and now everything works fine.\n\nA: found another thread where a workaround is \"sudo pm-suspend\". Seems to work well for me. I'm using Intel Ivy Bridge graphics.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on Ubuntu Gnome 15.10. This is what worked for me:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nEdit the line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash'\"\nReplace it with: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi='!Windows 2013' acpi_osi='!Windows 2012'\"\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen you have to reboot twice. I know. You have to do it twice, though.\nThat fixed the issue for me, hopefully, this helps someone else. \n\nA: Has anyone thought the problem might be suspending with unmounted drives (partitions or USB drives) showing. I had this problem recently, and no other changes than having unmounted drives @ suspend caused the problem. When any detected drives/partitions were mounted, the suspend feature worked flawlessly. This is probably a duplicate but I'm not searching for it.\nThanks.\n", "Q: Multiple Problems while installing VMware Player with Kernel Headers Sorry, pretty long problem\nFirst some background: I was running Ubuntu 13.10 x64 in my laptop. I just upgraded to 14.04 few weeks back.  The output of the uname -a currently on my system are\nLinux ubuntu 3.11.0-19-generic #33-Ubuntu SMP Tue Mar 11 18:48:34 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nNow, I downloaded the VMware-Player-6.0.2-1744117.x86_64.bundle and tried to install it on my Laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 x64.\nI installed VMWare-Player bundle usual way via\nsudo sh VMware-Player-6.0.2-1744117.x86_64.bundle\nAfter that, I tried to run the VMWare Player by searching through the search dock and clicking on its icon. I get this window\n\nI googled the problem and found many people had faced such similar problem but with many different solutions. Unfortunately, none worked for me.\nOne was to install the header via this command\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nI tried it and got the following output\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nPackage linux-headers-3.11.0-19-generic is not available, but is referred to by another package.\nThis may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or\nis only available from another source\n\nE: Package 'linux-headers-3.11.0-19-generic' has no installation candidate\n\nThis was scary.\nThen I tried to another solution\nsudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all\n\nagain for no luck. Failed to setup build environment.\nThen I tried this solution\nI was totally confused then because the terminal showed, the path /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux   i.e.\n/lib/modules/3.11.0-19-generic/build/include/linux didn't exists!\nThen I executed the following commands to clear my doubt:\n$ cd /lib/modules\n$:/lib/modules$ ls\n3.11.0-19-generic  3.13.0-24-generic\n$:/lib/modules$ ls 3.11.0-19-generic 3.13.0-24-generic\n3.11.0-19-generic:\ninitrd  modules.alias      modules.builtin      modules.dep      modules.devname  modules.softdep  modules.symbols.bin\nkernel  modules.alias.bin  modules.builtin.bin  modules.dep.bin  modules.order    modules.symbols  updates\n\n3.13.0-24-generic:\nbuild\n\nI am totally confused about whats wrong with my system and what should I do now? \nThanks!\n\nA: The installed kernel was obsolete. Its headers is not any more in the repository. So the best thing to do is to update the kernel to last version in the repository.\nTo enable auto update for the kernel, install linux-generic which is a meta package to keep current version of the kernel & its headers:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\nFor some reason this meta wasn't installed while upgrade for you. If it didn't work, then use Synaptic to install its headers or upgrade/install to the last kernel release (search for \"linux\").\n", "Q: Can't play .mp4 files embedded in html5 player in Firefox I have just installed Lubuntu 14.04.\nI can run .mp4 video files directly with Firefox but if i put them into an HTML5 tag then I get error: 'video format or mime type is not supported'.\nI have been searching for a solution to this for hours now, I've tried so much but to no avail.\nI am using Firefox version 28.0.\nOS: LUbuntu 14.04 and I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed flashplugin-installer.\n\n*Set media.gstreamer.enabled to false in about:config.\n\n*Changed the .htaccess file to include:\nAddType video/mp4 mp4 m4v f4v f4p\nAddType video/ogg ogv\nAddType video/webm webm\nAddType video/x-flv flv  \nAnd I have also done:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\n\nAccording to: 10 Things To Do After Installing Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr To Get A Near Perfect Desktop\nThen I installed Lubuntu extras, as is detailed here, but its all to no avail and the error just persists.\nDoes anybody know how I can get to view HTML5 embedded .mp4 files in Firefox?\n\nA: To \"fix\" this, all you need is install the \"gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\" package and its dependencies. If you've upgraded from an older Ubuntu version, this package might already be installed but if this is a fresh install, you can get the package from a PPA. Add the PPA and install it using the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\n\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu.html\n\nA: What solved it was to go in Firefox’ URL bar and type about:config,\nand there set media.gstreamer.enabled to true.\n", "Q: Run a command on Shutdown? I recently installed Grive, a third party Google Drive tool for Ubuntu, and in order to sync the folders, you must run the command grive in the Google Drive folder in your home page. Is there a way I can automate a simple command before my system shuts down to ensure I always sync my libraries?\nThanks!\n\nA: As mentioned by Warrent Hill, Execute command before shutdown/reboot is the way to do it. Create a script under /etc/init.d/shutdown_google_drive.sh and add softlinks as required in rc6.d.\nHowever, if the synchronization may take over 60 seconds (I'm pretty sure this is the default timeout,) then it won't work because the shutdown process has a watchdog and a script that takes too long is simply stopped (as in killed) and the shutdown process moves on.\nTo make sure you do not lose data, you may consider using shutdown -c in your script (I would think it's possible) and let the user know that the shutdown was cancelled in the event your sync-ing is taking too much time.\n", "Q: Upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 from a terminal How do I upgrade to 14.04 around my existing system with out re-installing?\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64 currently.\nI have checked through update manager.\nIs there a way to do it through Terminal?\n\nA: The (discussable) best way to do it is to switch to a TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and login.\nNo enter sudo do-release-upgrade.

But your expectations were wrong: tar -xzf does not install the archive, it just unpacks it to the current directory. To launch Djl, you have to launch djl.sh:\ncd Downloads\ntar -xzf djl-1.2.20.tar.gz\ndjl/djl.sh\n\n\nTo finish Djl installation, you should move it to /opt and make symlink to djl.sh:\nsudo mv djl /opt\nsudo ln -s /opt/djl/djl.sh /usr/local/bin/djl\n\nAfter that, you can run Djl just typing djl in the Terminal.\nIf your goal is to make it visible in the Dash, you have to make .desktop file for it (hope you know how to do it; if not, simply use one of .desktop files in /usr/share/applications as basis) and place in ~/.local/share/applications.\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Djl\nExec=djl\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nPath=/opt/djl\nIcon=/opt/djl/icone.png\nGenericName[en_US]=Game manager \n\n\nA: By default downloaded files would be stored inside the ~/Downloads directory.

I have had an HP LaserJet 2550L for a long time now. Since I upgraded to 13.10, I cannot print in black and white anymore.\nBefore, the driver would give me an option in the Print dialog. Although I had to remember and change the setup each time I would print, since I rarely print color documents, it wasn't that bad.\nHowever, no such option appears in the newer version. Downgrading is always a very annoying feature update!\nSo I looked around and found that I had to go to preferences, printers, right click on my LaserJet 2550L and select Properties.\nIn there, I can click on Job Options and on that screen I see defaults, including the print-color-mode which is set to Color.\nClicking on the dropdown, I can select monochrome and then click either Apply or Save.

I tried upgrading to 14.04 but I cant make made ubuntu work in paralel with windows 8.1 were I dont have any problem with temperature . Why only in ubuntu 13.10 and how to fix it ?\n\nA: I have a Lenovo Z500 CORE i7 running on Ubuntu 14.04 and had experienced overheating too. This is due to the dedicated graphics card, a nVidia GT 635m, running constantly, instead of using the integrated Intel 4000 HD graphics chip.\nYou should set up your Ubuntu to use the internal graphics to decrease heat and when wanting to use the dedicated graphics, the nVidia, use it with Bumblebee, e.g. $ primusrun [your-app]. Follow the online instructions either here:\nBumblebee Installation\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia virtualgl linux-headers-generic\n\n*Reboot\nor here:\nHow to install nVidia drivers with Bumblebee on Ubuntu\nIf you want to run Ubuntu 14.04 in parallel with Win 8.1 you need to install it on a separate partition to Windows 8.1, using one that's available or shrinking a used one with caution.

It is in the Ubuntu repos. Adjust the input level before recording; after recording, do a \"normalize\" and export to mp3 or whatever you need.\n\n\nA: Audio Recorder\nAlthough Audacity works for this, it's a bit on the overkill side with all the features and controls. If you're using Ubuntu, try audio-recorder. It will record anything that comes out of your speakers. You can select Custom Audio Device and then, under Device settings, select Built-in Audio Analog Stereo (Microphone).\n\nWhen I get stuck on any audio source, I circumvent the problem. I record the audio using my (standalone) Zoom H1 stereo digital recorder (plugged into the headphone jack or audio out of the source device). It will save the audio on its own micro SD card as wav or mp3 files (with lots of quality options). Then, I just copy the files to wherever I need them. It's an extra step and another device to buy, but it works wonderfully and is useful for a lot of other things.\n\n", "Q: How do I reset Unity default shortcuts?

I've posted my config here for anyone who's interested (the commented line 6 was the cause of the problem). \nI'm unsure how I got the setting on line 6 set. Looking at the settings dialog for gnome terminal, there's nothing that I see that seems like it would cause that behavior. \nEdit\nFound the setting. I'm not sure how I missed before, or why I clicked it in the first place. I don't know how this \"feature\" could ever be a good thing to have, since you can't get back into the settings to set it back.\n\n\nA: You can also turn on the menu bar with this command in terminal:\ngnome-terminal --show-menubar\n\nIt helped me to solve this problem, so I'm posting it here. I hope it will be useful for others.\n\nA: In my case (Ubuntu 16), going to System Settings > Appearance > Behaviour. Under the \"Show the menus for a window\", selecting \"In the windows title bar\", solved it.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu (on its own partition, Windos 8 machine) and lost both boot options in BIOS I partitioned the unit in Windows first, and after I disabled Windows in BIOS because it wasn't allowing the boot CD to load. After the installation, the option to enable Windows and the option to enable Ubuntu in BIOS were no longer there. How do I get them to function?\n\n\n\nA: For BIOS issues I'd recommend contacting the manufacturer of your motherboard/system/laptop. I'll narrow it down for you if you provide the make and model of your system in your question.\nBased on your comment I believe you have an ASUS S46CA you can contact the manufacturer about repairing your BIOS boot options here\n", "Q: Whole system freezes, even TTY does not work I upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 and now after a while the complete OS freezes.

You can try updating to a mainline kernel (How do I add the mainline kernel PPA?), or install the Nvidia proprietary drivers (Ubuntu 14.04 install NVIDIA driver). It would probably help to get the bug fixed if you report it to freedesktop.org or the Nouveau mailing list.\nYour system also has Intel integrated graphics, so another option would be to disable the Nvidia card.\n", "Q: Feeling \"lost\" when I am on Linux I don't know if this question really is on-topic for this website. But if I go to the \"Productivity\" one I may not get so many Linux people at once.\nMy question isn't a technical one. It's more \"spiritual\".\nI want to use Linux but I feel \"lost\" when I actually have it. Don't get me wrong, it's not about knowledge or anything. I have no problem learning new things. \nI just have this feeling every time I wipe out Windows to move to Linux that doesn't go away. Like when you lose someone dear and after years you still feel him/her in your hearth.\nI want to move to Linux. Everything I have to do on Windows I can visualize, so that is not an issue. Also, there are huge benefits in moving to Linux for me, as for the work I do it would really help having a Linux Machine to do \"dirty work\" (grepping/one-liners/programming in a blink/ecc). I am really motivated. \nI think about it for all week at work. And I promise myself that in the weekend I'll wipe off Windows to put Linux. But as soon as I do that I feel \"empty\". Like a part of me being ripped off.\nMy question is: how can I overcome this feeling long enough to get into the habbit of using Linux, so that I can switch operating systems like nothing? I now it sounds silly but I am really in a dead end.\n\nA: Switching to Linux need never be traumatic.  There are many ways to \nkeep both operating system available until you are comfortable, and\nmany ways to keep the old OS around \"just in case\".  Some of the \napproaches are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put Linux on an external USB stick or disk.  If the external device\ncan be put first in the boot order, you can do this with absolutely\nno change at all to the host machine.\n\n*You can run Linux in a virtual machine\nlike VirtualBox under Windows. WUBI used to be used for this, but is\nbeing pretty much phased out. \n\n*Dual boot Linux with Windows.  Both operating systems may be put\non the same disk, and a choice made at boot time through a\nbootloader like grub.   \n\n*You can run Windows in a virtual\nmachine under LInux. VMware offers a converter to grab a copy of a\nrunning Windows machine, and a free  player.  VirtualBox can run the\nWindows off its original filesystem.\n\n\nYou have a step-by-step approach for getting comfortable with Linux, and ways\nto keep Windows around until you just don't care about it anymore.\n", "Q: Fresh Install Ubuntu 14.04 Server Slow Boot due to failure to connect 169.254.169.254 Have just installed Ubuntu Server 14.04 and have no VM instances operational.\nBoot time takes an eternity and on pressing F1 during loading this is what I see, the continued connect attempts and failures are endless any straightforward fixes would be appreciated (Note have replaced http with LINK in the log mentions to enable this posting):-\n\nCloud-init v. 0.7.5 running 'init-local' at Tue, 06 May 2014 19:42:27 +0000.

This issue manifested when we started using our existing icehouse friendly images in a juno cloud.  No other OS had this issue except our 14.04 image.\nWe also based our 14.04 image on the Canonical Cloud version.\n\nA: In my case (new install using Ubuntu Juju) the problem was that neutron was misconfigured with the wrong ip address for the metadata server.\nThis is good: http://techbackground.blogspot.ie/2013/06/metadata-via-dhcp-namespace.html\nThat pointed me at: root@neutron:/etc/neutron# cat metadata_agent.ini\n    ...\n  nova_metadata_ip = 192.168.100.151\n  nova_metadata_port = 8775\n    ...\n\nI fixed the nova_metadata_ip adn restarted the neutron metadata service and that solved the issue.\n", "Q: How do I open Chromium in incognito mode by default? I would like to be able to open Chromium in incognito mode automatically. I'm new to Linux and I love it so far but I haven't yet found a way to do this. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: This is how I do it using alacarte (main menu).\nInstall alacarte (aka main menu) from the Ubuntu Software Center if you don't already have it. Launch it.\nOn the left hand side, under Menus, make sure Applications is expanded. Look for Internet. Single click it. Now look for Chrome under Items. Single click it. Look for Properties on the right hand side. Single click it. A little window appears. (I've dragged it to the right for clarity.) Look for Command. For me, I see /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome %U.\n\nCarefully change that to:\n/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --incognito %U\nClick Close on the little window and then click Close on the Main Menu window. You need to log out and log in to make the change register.\nYou're done.\n(I just did it so I know it works.)\n\nA: I assume you mean the Chromium Web Browser.\nYou have to change one line in the chromium-browser.desktop file. The best is to do that locally: \n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the file from /usr/share/applications to /home/yourname/.local/share/applications\n\n*Open the file with gedit (open gedit and drag the local desktop file on to the gedit window)\n\n*Find the first line in the file that begins with Exec= \n\n*Replace the line by Exec=chromium-browser --incognito\na few remarks:\n\n\n*\n\n*The folder /home/yourname/.local/share/applications is a hidden folder by default. To make it visibe: go to your home folder, type ctrl + h, the .local folder will appear.\n\n*You can copy the chromium-browser.desktop file to your local folder with the command: cp /usr/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop\n\n*You might have to log out and back in before the changes to take effect.\n\nA: There are two steps,\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser and select /usr/bin/chromium-browser. This will make Chromium your system's default browser.\n\n*Run sudo -e /etc/chromium-browser/default (edit as root), and change the line that reads CHROMIUM_FLAGS=\"\" to CHROMIUM_FLAGS=\"--incognito\".\n\n\nThat's it. Changes are instantaneous.\nAlso, if you ever want to open chrome without incognito mode, just hold Ctrl + n in incognito mode.\nSee also,\n\n\n*\n\n*Where can I configure Chromium's default command line arguments?\n\nA: *\n\n*You need create a Chrome incognito.desktop file like with the following contents:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Chrome incognito\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --incognito\nTerminal=false\nIcon=google-chrome\nType=Application\nCategories=Network;WebBrowser;\nMimeType=text/html;text/xml;application/xhtml_xml;x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https;x-scheme-handler/ftp;\n\n\n\n*Save this file, open Nautilus with root permission (run gksu nautilus).\n\n\n*Browse to /usr/share/applications and paste the file here.\n\n\n*Now you can drag this icon to your launcher.\n\n\n*Click on launcher icon, Chrome will start in incognito mode.\n\nA: The solution which worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*open an incognito window\n\n*lock it to luncher\n\n*remove the other chrome from luncher\n\n*whenever you click this icon in luncher an incognito window of chrome will be opened. \n\n", "Q: How to display the IP address of the sender when rsyslog rejects a UDP message?

It allows one specific host to send messages to it:\n$AllowedSender UDP, 192.168.4.1\n\nWhen I send a message from a different server, it rejects the message and logs:\nrsyslogd: UDP message from disallowed sender discarded\n\nIs it possible to configure rsyslog to include the IP address of the rejected sender?\n\nA: I downloaded the version 5 source (https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/archive/v5-stable.zip) and looked at plugins/imudp/imudp.c.  In this file, it's a hardcoded message with no option for displaying the sender's frominet IP address:\nif(glbl.GetOption_DisallowWarning) {\n    time_t tt;\n    datetime.GetTime(&tt);\n    if(tt > ttLastDiscard + 60) {\n        ttLastDiscard = tt;\n        errmsg.LogError(0, NO_ERRCODE,\n        \"UDP message from disallowed sender discarded\");\n    }\n}\n\nI also found that tools/syslogd.c contains a now-unused remnant chkMsgAgainstACL() that did display the fromHost value.\nerrmsg.LogError(0, NO_ERRCODE,\n    \"UDP message from disallowed sender %s discarded\",\n    (char*)fromHost);\n\nI'm not sure why Rainer decided not to keep that feature.

When I download Wine to play Windows games, will I also be able to play those Windows games through Steam? \n\nA: You won't be able to play Windows games using native Steam for Linux, but you can install Steam for Windows on Wine (not sure if it'll work, but you can try).\n\nA: Steam for Windows under Wine works wonderfully. It lets me play Unturned and Terraria (the two main games I cannot play on linux) without issues (so far). Moreover, if the game you are looking at is a source engine game, such as Team Fortress 2 (which is, by the way, also available on Steam for Linux natively,) then you may run into some text rendering issues caused by a lack of native windows fonts. However, games that don't use said fonts (such as Times New Roman, Arial, Tahoma, Comic Sans MS, etc.) should work phenomenally.\nHowever, as pointed out by a few people, if you are playing games which are on their own very resource taxing, it would be best to dual boot with Windows.\n\nA: There is some complexity but generally it is impossible to answer this question. Some games, yes, others, no. There are, however, lots of alternative ways to run Steam games on Linux.\nA lot of games are now built for Linux, and you can view these in the Steam store by hovering over \"Games\" and selecting SteamOS + Linux - these games are all available as native Linux binaries. This probably won't be enough for most gamers, but it is at least something.\nThere is also a feature in Steam known as Home Streaming. This allows you to stream games from a Windows PC to your Linux PC without needing to have the game installed on the Linux PC. It's a bit flaky and doesn't always perform perfectly, but depending on the nature of the games you're playing it may well handle it just fine. You'll want to make sure both machines are on the same network and use the best connections available (that is to say if ethernet is available, use it).\nFrom personal experience, I'm running Elite: Dangerous on an old laptop with an i5 and onboard 4000 series graphics, 4GB RAM and a fairly slow 5400RPM single platter hard drive, the game is of the same quality as it is on my xbox one.\n\nA: From my own experience I can confirm that Steam for Windows works great with recent versions of Wine.\nBy this you can run many naitve Windows games available through Steam using Wine or Play On Linux. Issues and games which won't run, or tweaks needed are best being queried from the Wine Application Database. It may also be worth to have a look at the Steam support forums for issues.\nAs a rule of thumb: if a game is listed as Platinum you will be able to play it without issues. A game rated as Gold will be playble just fine but may need some tweaks. All other ratings indiciate more or less severe issues.\nPerformance of games played through Wine varies considerably but many games will just perform fine with only a minor perfomance loss as compared to native Windows. This will also include 3D graphics which is supported through DriectX drivers in Wine.\nSadly however there is no guarantee that any single game you bought will actually run on your specific system. In case a Linux version is available through Steam you will probably better install this version.\nIt is also possible to connect your Steam account to both, native Steam for Ubuntu, and Steam for Windows run through Wine.\n\nA: You should really check the wine homepage. It will tell you how most games and other software work on various distributions using wine. Wine is able to make many pieces of Windows software work, sometimes with some workarounds. If you want an easier way to get Windows software working, check out Planonlinux. POL is a front for Wine, it does a lot of the configuration behind the scenes for you. If you want to pay for software you can also check out Crossover. It's made by the developers of Wine but it's more polished and has actual customer support.\n\nA: Software that makes extensive use of accelerated 3D graphics, such as most mainstream Windows games, will not run well on Wine.\nThey may not run at all, or run with significantly degraded performance.  Wine is good at running office or productivity applications but its limitations start becoming significant when pushing it with 3D gaming.  You're unlikely to get a good experience with it.\nOn top of this, I have no idea how well Steam for Windows would run in Wine on Linux.  You wouldn't be able to run Windows-only games with Steam for Linux, as has been pointed out.\nIf you are a heavy gamer and have a legal copy of Windows, dual-booting is the best solution for running heavy 3D games.\n\nA: I agree with the first answer - Steam does work great with Linux, but some fonts and other graphical issues may crop up occasionally. By that I mean that the fonts on the \"Updating\" window appear more blocky and without anti-aliasing than the counterpart on Windows. Some games may not work correctly due to unimplemented functions in Wine - if you have a problem, first open the log, and find the DLL, and then go into winecfg and make it try to load the native libraries first. (There are online tutorials for doing this.)\nSometimes, other programs might require Microsoft .NET or other programs like Microsoft SilverLight or some other things which there are only Microsoft implementations of. In that case, there is little you can do if you only have Wine, but PlayOnLinux attempts to solve some of those problems by installing some of the programs you need such as Mono or Microsoft Fonts. It still doesn't work correctly sometimes.\nThere are some minor performance losses compared to Windows, and either way, I recommend that you install the proprietary nVidia or AMD/ATI graphics drivers. The FOSS versions don't have as much functionality compared to the closed-source version.\nOn another note, however, and yes, I know somebody else already posted this, there is a proprietary version of Wine called CrossOver, and it costs about $40USD for the cheapest option, and up to $60USD for the option with 12 months of online support and 1 month of phone support.\nAs my final point, I would like to make it clear that yes, I use Linux Mint 17.1 as my primary OS, but I still have Windows 7 installed so that I can use it if I have to, for running programs like the latest version of Office or things like Visual Studio. Windows is so cheap nowadays that you could probably pick up a version of Windows 8.1 for less than $100, so you can probably do that if absolutely necessary.\n", "Q: Can´t install Ubuntu 14.04 When I try to Install Ubuntu 14.04 either the x86 or 64 bit version (I´m using Windows 8.1) the Install process freezes after I choose Continue when asked about installing via internet some mp3 stuff.

Some strange things happened with network manager. \nFirst, it stopped communicating with my 3G modem (Sierra Aircard 312U). Around $100 later I have a 3G router broadcasting a wireless signal that I can hook up to (although Ubuntu lost the signal overnight and I had to restart the computer to get it communicating again).\nThis has been deeply frustrating and unwelcome. But its not the weird bit.\nI have two unknown networks listed in the Network Manager's dropdown box. The first is for a \"Galaxy Note3 Network\". The second is for \"Tsai's iPhone Network\". Wifi networks, (including my phone's hotspot) and all the usual stuff is listed below these two. \n(If I tether my phone to the computer to access the internet (i.e. hook up a cable), the list says \"wired connection 1\", then Tsai's and Galaxy Note3 would appear next, with wifi options in a section below that).\nI cannot edit connections for either of these new networks, or gather any settings info at all - or even delete them. They are persistent across restarts.\nAny ideas? Anyone else? Have I somehow been hacked by a clumsy infiltrator? I downloaded the update from the Australian mirror.\nEDIT\nPicture of the menu\n\n\nA: Answering the question\nOne of the people in the area around you is hosting a hotspot using their iPhone, and another person is broadcasting a hotspot using their Samsung Galaxy Note 3. You shouldn't be worried about the networks that you are unfamiliar with, because people make their own networks for different purposes. \nHacking\nIt is very unlikely that a mobile or tablet would be used for hacking, because the hardware on most portable devices is simply not powerful enough to make the hacker's time worthwhile. \nAbout being not able to edit the networks\nYou won't be able to edit them because if you haven't connected to them with a password, the network details are not able to be given to your computer. However the names of those networks will still be there. This is so Network Manager has an idea of how to connect to the network next time the user requests to connect to the remembered network. \n\nA: This is an old question but the only thing I have found while trying to solve a similar issue on my 14.04.2 install. I had a similar menu entry that mysteriously appeared and eventually realised it had appeared after I had paired my phone to my laptop via bluetooth (it would appear whether bluetooth was switched on or not). In my case this seemed to be causing Wifi connection problems too so was not just a cosmetic issue.\nSo for the benefit of anyone googling for an answer to this: Simply delete the relevant paired device in Bluetooth Settings. \nIt would probably be useful if it was indicated that these menu entries are for bluetooth tethering or some such as it really isn't clear what they are for.\n\nA: You are seeing a bluetooth connection, which you can get more information on with nmcli:\nnmcli -p con\n\n", "Q: New laptop won't boot after installing Ubuntu 14.04 on SSD I removed the HDD from a Toshiba Computer I bought today and installed a 250GB SSD.

Delete the ubuntu partition.\nI'm not an experienced user, so i'm sorry if something goes wrong.\n\nA: Boot into windows, and use the windows computer manage tool to remove the ubuntu partition. In your windows explorer, right click on \"This PC\" and select \"manage\" from the cascading menu. Select the Storage>Disk Management section in the menu on the left hand side, and find the partitions which contain your linux info. There will be a number of them, and windows will say they are unidentified or something. Then, you will need to repair your Master Boot Record so you don't fail loading the linux boot software you just removed. To do this, follow the instructions here.

It asks encryption password every time when back up starts. I entered every related passwords (server's one, client's one, and all things I think related), but it does not help. After entering encryption password, deja-dup works for some time and asks password again.\nI expected this symptom has been solved in 14.04, but unforatunately deja-dup in 14.04 has exactly the same case.\nHere is my environment of backup ...\nMy laptop computer (ThinkPad X220) is scheduled to be backed up files under my home directory in every week. The destination of backup is my office computer (running Ubuntu 12.04). This backup is made using ssh connection (so, selection of backup style in deja-dup is \"ssh\"). \nHelp, suggestion and answers appreciated.\n\nA: If you run Deja-Dup from a terminal, you may be able to get more info on the problem:\nexport DEJA_DUP_DEBUG=1\ndeja-dup --backup\n\nIn my particular case, it turned out that there was a stale lock file preventing GnuPG from working at all. Deleting ~/.gnupg/gnupg_spawn_agent_sentinel.lock solved the issue for me.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with deja-dup running on Ubuntu 14.04.  I found that these \ndirectories in my home folder were owned by root.\n\n\n*\n\n*.dbus\n\n*.gnupg\n\n*.gvfs\n\n*.rnd\nAfter I changed the ownership of those directories and their contents to me, deja-dup was able to create an encrypted backup of my home directory.\n\nA: I also faced this annoying problem and it is still an open bug (here is the report)\nChanging the path/name of the backup folder solved the issue for me.\n\nA: deja-dup uses duplicity, so perhaps there is an option in the gui to turn off encryption?\nFor example, with a duplicity command you'd turn off encryption this way: \nduplicity --no-ecryption --verbosity 8 /home/user/folder-to-backup/ file:///home/user/backup/destination-folder/\n\nI realize this doesn't address your question perfectly, but sense no one else has tried, I thought I'd say something. Turning encryption off might not be acceptable, but I suspect it would prevent that prompting you're trying to avoid.\n\nA: Here's what I did:\nI formatted and renamed my external USB disk and then selected it under \"Storage location.\"\nAlso, this time I chose the option \"Allow to restore files without password.\"\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but...\nTo reset the password (yes, I have found a way to reset deja-dup password.) you must simply enter your deja-dup folder and delete EVERY SINGLE BACKUP. On it's next attempt to backup, it should ask you for a NEW password.\nCheers!\n\nA: Following @Ponkadoodle's answer to debug he problem I only found a vacuous stack trace due to an EOFError with the text Compressed file ended before the end-of-stream marker was reached.\nWhat actually helped was deleting the directory ~/.cache/deja-dup/[32 digit hex]. The backup started immediately afterwards finally succeeded.\nThe directory was recreated by Déjà Dup, so the hex string seems more like an identifier than a random name.\nI also found that my .gnupg directory was owned by root. I changed that in accordance to @Robert C.'s answer.

If it's a forward proxy, then it should only be possible for the authorised person to use it - not any arbitrary user out on the internet.  If it's a reverse proxy, it should only be usable for contacting the one particular website it's designed to proxy for - not any arbitrary site.\nThe above is in addition to the usual security considerations that apply to any software.\n", "Q: Post Ubuntu Installation : Post Ubuntu Installation is it necessary to install the motherboard drivers .

I know the package is available in the Software Center, and I installed it, but I am unable to use it.\n\nA: In fact, I have not been able to use my Wacom Tablet with fancy KDE-settings (systemsettings) under an untouched Mint (tryed with Ubuntu based and Debian based), yet you can tweak it a bit and make it work and access happily to most of config in KDE-config and let it work.\nTo achive this I made a fresh Linux Mint 17 LTS Xfce install and installed not only systemsettings but also kwin (sudo apt-get install kde-window-manager) which is the composite window manager used by KDE. Might seem strange but you will get your original desktop (Xfce in my case, but might be MATE, Cinnamon, Unity, Gnome or whatever) with another window manager (that you'll see in window decorations, fancy bouncy icon of loading application beside the cursor and that kind of fancy KDE stuff, and also window capabilities provided by kwint, such as invert colors, transparency on the fly and others.\nTo switch to kwin you should execute:\nkwin --replace\n\nWich can be done at startup. And to return to previous mode:\n<your-previous-window-manager> --replace\n\nIn the case of Xfce:\nxfwm4 --replace\n\nBut in any case expect some fails, reboots, requirement of KDE services ...\nUpdate: Managed to have the fancy KDE wacom system settings.\nAfter some research, I wonder if the kde tablet service was actually running or not, so, tried modifying some config after reading this https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=37365\nIn a terminal:\ncd /usr/share/kde4/services/kded #where your kde dir might be\nsudo cp wacomtablet.desktop wacomtablet.desktop.old #just in case I broke something\nsudo gedit wacomtablet.desktop #can use nano, vi, or your favorite editor\n\nchanged this line in the file wacomtablet.desktop:\n    X-KDE-Kded-phase=0 #was before 1 in my case.\nRestart KDE services:\nkded4\n\nDone!\nTell us if it works for you!\n\nA: The package is probably a plugin of the main system settings program, which is called systemsettings(1) and come from the package with the same name: \nsudo apt-get install systemsettings\n\nNow you will have the settings for the tablet in the systemsettings menu:\n\n...but I do not know how much good it can do for non-KDE applications. In my system (Ubuntu Gnome 14.40), if called I have: \n\nso probably it will of no use outside a KDE environment(2).\n\nFootnotes:\n(1) I have it installed to control the appearance of KDE programs I use, like digiKam. \n(2) Simplicity versus configurability... sometime I find myself too wanting to check again Kubuntu.   \n", "Q: Nagios-Plugin \"check_radius\" missing in Ubuntu 14.04?

The -l tells grep to list the matching files instead of printing the match. You can then use the list of files as an input to the mv command e.g.\ngrep -lzP '\\Q@<TRIPOS>BOND\\E\\n\\Q@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\\E' * | xargs mv -t /path/to/newdir/\n\n\nAdditional info\nYou could express the second part of the match as a lookahead but I don't think it has any advantage in this case\ngrep -lzP '\\Q@<TRIPOS>BOND\\E\\n(?=\\Q@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\\E)' *\n\nEquivalent expressions in pcregrep (which is not part of the standard Ubuntu system, but obtainable from the repository) would be something like\npcregrep -lM '\\Q@<TRIPOS>BOND\\E\\n\\Q@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\\E' *\n\nand\npcregrep -lM '\\Q@<TRIPOS>BOND\\E\\n(?=\\Q@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\\E)' *\n\n\nA: How about \nfor file in *.txt; do \n    grep -A1 \"@<TRIPOS>BOND\" \"$file\" | grep -q SUBSTR && mv \"$file\" bad_files/\ndone\n\nExplanation:\nThis will loop through all .txt files in the current directory (change to the blob to whatever matches your files) and save each as $file. It will then search $file for @<TRIPOS>BOND and print that and the next line. This is passed through the next grep which silently (-q) looks for SUBSTR, if it finds it, it means that the line after BOND is SUBSTRUCTURE and not the numeric line you want so it will move the current file to the folder bad_files.\n\nA: It's not that simple:\nfind -type f -exec \\\n awk '/@<TRIPOS>BOND/{getline; \\\n  if ($0 !~ /1  3  5  ar/){\\\n  printf \"mv %s /path/to/move/%s\\n\", FILENAME, FILENAME}}' {} \\; \\\n| bash\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*find -type f: Find all files in the current working directory\n\n*awk '/@<TRIPOS>BOND/{getline; \\: find the line inside the file and move to the next line\n\n*if ($0 !~ /1  3  5  ar/){\\: If the next line is NOT (!~) your desired \"numeric line\"\n\n*printf \"mv %s /path/to/move/%s\\n\", FILENAME, FILENAME}}' {} \\; \\: build an mv command and pipe it to...\n\n*| bash: ...bash and execute it.\n\n\nSo the command will mv all file that are not contianing the numeric line to a directory called /path/to/move/.\n\nA: nawk '/^@<TRIPOS>BOND/{getline;if( $0 ~ /^@/){print \"mv\", FILENAME, \"../NewLoc/\"}}' * | bash\n\n\nA: The task is quite simple using awk.  Here's my example. I've created two files file-nm (for not-missing) and file-m(for missing), and moved directory for the files that we want to move. \nawk '/@<TRIPOS>BOND/ {getline; if ($0 == \"@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\" ) system(\"mv \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\" moved\")}' file-nm file-m\nHere we find the @<TRIPOS>BOND string, step into the next line, and check if that line is @<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE. If it is, we make system call with \"mv \" the FILENAME of the file that has been found, and \" moved\" as destination. Here's the result:\n$ ls\nfile-m  file-nm  moved\n\n\n$ awk '/@<TRIPOS>BOND/ {getline; if ($0 == \"@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\" ) system(\"mv \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\" moved\")}' file-nm file-m      \n\n\n$ ls                                                                                                                     \nfile-nm  moved\n\n\n$ ls moved                                                                                                               \nfile-m\n\n\nA: Using awk or gawk\nawk '/@<TRIPOS>BOND/,/@/ {getline; if ($_ ~ /^@/) {printf \"%s:%s\\n\",$_,FILENAME; system (\"mv \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\" <bad_files>/$(basename \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\")\")} exit}' <file_name>\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*/@<TRIPOS>BOND/,/@/\nWe need only the block between @<TRIPOS>BOND and the next line starting with @\n\n*getline\nRead the next line after @<TRIPOS>BOND\n\n*if ($_ ~ /^@/)\nCheck, if the line starts with a @\n\n\n*\n\n*true\nPrint a message\nprintf \"%s:%s\\n\",$_,FILENAME\n\nMove the file\nsystem (\"mv \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\" <bad_files>/$(basename \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\")\")\n\n\n*false\nLeave the script\nexit\n\n\nExample\n$ cat foo\n@<TRIPOS>ATOM\n  2 H18 65.2220 Du 1 RES1 0.0000\n@<TRIPOS>BOND\n@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\n\n$ cat bar\n@<TRIPOS>ATOM\n  2 H18 65.2220 Du 1 RES1 0.0000\n@<TRIPOS>BOND\n 1  3  5  ar\n@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\n\n$ awk '/@<TRIPOS>BOND/,/@/ {getline; if ($_ ~ /^@/) {printf \"%s:%s\\n\",$_,FILENAME; system (\"mv \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\" \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\"_moved\")} exit}' foo\n@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE:foo\n\n$ awk '/@<TRIPOS>BOND/,/@/ {getline; if ($_ ~ /^@/) {printf \"%s:%s\\n\",$_,FILENAME; system (\"mv \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\" \\\"\"FILENAME\"\\\"_moved\")} exit}' bar\n\n$ cat foo_moved \n@<TRIPOS>ATOM\n  2 H18 65.2220 Du 1 RES1 0.0000\n@<TRIPOS>BOND\n@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE\n\n$ cat bar_moved\ncat: bar_moved: No such file or directory\n\n", "Q: Can't enter Windows after \"Erase Ubuntu and reinstall it\" I was running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a dual-boot with the preinstalled Windows 8.1 that came with my laptop.\nI was messing around with the launcher interface (You know the cube thing and all that graphical stuff) and I wanted to go back, so I reinstalled Ubuntu with a live USB.\nThere was an option that said Erase Ubuntu and reinstall it So I obviously picked that one.\nEverything installed ok, and I am currently running Ubuntu.

Warnings like 'WARNING:main:no data, and even one ERROR - trying to repair DB failed. But they don't reproduce afterwards.\n\n*Also, one of the package is compiz. I went to check the changelog on Launchpad, and noticed the following history page: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/trusty/amd64/compiz. It says \"Phased updates\", \"40% of users\". Could this be linked to that? Is there a way to bypass this phased updates when using the Software Updater (as when using apt-get)?\n\n\nA: Hm, this seems to be exactly what PhasedUpdates are. Also check out http://www.murraytwins.com/blog/?p=127 and http://lwn.net/Articles/563966/.\nTo summarize links above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu quietly introduced a new mechanism in its 13.04 release that progressively rolls out package updates, pushing each update to a small subset of the total user base first, then steadily scaling up, rather than publishing the update for everyone simultaneously.\n\n*On the client end, phased updates are implemented in the update-manager tool, which is Ubuntu's graphical update installation application. The other methods for updating a package, such as apt-get, are not affected by the phased update plan.\n\n*update-manager generates a random number between zero and one for each package, then compares it to the Phased-Update-Percentage value published on the server for that package. If update-manager's generated number is less than the published percentage, then the package will be added to the list of available updates that the user can install. Dependencies for a package are pulled in automatically.\n\n*One can opt out of the Phased Update process by adding the following to the configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf:\nUpdate-Manager::Never-Include-Phased-Updates “True”;\n\nHere a one-liner to print all packages with the Phased-Update-Percentage tag:\napt-cache show \".*\"|sed -r '/^Package:/h;/^Phased-Update-Percentage:/{H;x;s/\\n/\\n\\t/;p};d'\n\n\nA: You have selected to display updates from trusty-updates weekly. I suggest you to change this setting to \"Display immediately\" and Security updates to \"Download and install automatically\".\n\nAlso, it will be convenient to use unattended-upgrades. Run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades\n\nand select \"Yes\".\n", "Q: Wifi device not ready, but it isn't hard nor soft blocked I'm unable to connect to wifi on my Toshiba Satellite U200, even though the wireless card doesn't seem to be blocked:\n$ rfkill list\n0: Toshiba Bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: yes\n6: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\nNote: when I boot it is blocked, but doing:\nmodprobe -rfv iwl3945\nrfkill unblock all\nmodprobe -v iwl3945\n\nUnblocks it.

During Ubuntu 14.04 installation, I received this error. I know the error is common, but I didn't find an answer, so please read below.\n\n\n[Errno 5] Input/output error\nThis is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard\n  disk. It may help to clean the CD/DVD, to burn the CD/DVD at a lower\n  speed, to clean the CD/DVD drive lens (cleaning kits are often\n  available from electronics suppliers), to check whether the hard disk\n  is old and in need of replacement, or to move the system to a cooler\n  environment.\n\n\nI've had this error before, but back then I had problem with Ubuntu .iso file (checksum wasn't correct). However, this time the checksum is correct. Moreover, I used both Ubuntu (Start-up app) and Windows (Universal-USB-Installer) ways for making bootable usb. Both of them are giving me this error. If it means something, in \"md5sum.txt\" file on bootable usb the hash doesn't match with the correct on.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: maybe you will be surprised like I am. I recently encountered the same problem while trying to install ubuntu 14.04 on my other laptop (i3 Dell-Vostro). What I did is; I used Universal-USB-installer to create a bootable usb, then tried installing, it didn't work, I've been reading  lots of suggestions here with no luck. Solution - I simply decided to use another software which is rufus (https://rufus.akeo.ie/) to create a bootable usb, then it worked, just like that. I am surprised, as simple as that. So now I think that Universal-USB-installer didn't copy all necessary files,I hope this is helpful. \n", "Q: Unity doesn't load ubuntu 14.04 I installed ubuntu 14.04 LTS with wubi and after 2 days of use after the login screen unity doesn't seem to load.

This includes things like:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*fonts used in user interface elements and titlebar\n\n*font hinting and aliasing\n\n*alternative user interface themes\n\n*changes in window management behaviour\n\n*behaviour on laptop lid close\n\n*file manager desktop icons\n\n*icons in menus and buttons\n\n\nA: If you read this tutorial from WebUpd8 you will be able to manually make these changes. - http://www.webupd8.org/2011/05/how-to-remove-maximized-windows.html\nFollow the steps for Method #2.\nNote- Method #1 is no longer maintained so it is not relevant anymore but Method #2 does still work.\nThis is if you want to remove the titlebar completely, if you want to blend the titlebar with the theme then @v2r's solution is more applicable.\n", "Q: System hangs frequently Environment\nSystem spec : Lenovo ideapad U310\nHaswell-based Pentium 3556U CPU, 4GB RAM, no discrete graphics.

Actually I try to realize this simple thing:\nI want to suppress the annoying \"Application xyz is ready\" notification. After a bit of research I found out, that this class is responsible:\nWindowAttentionHandler from /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/windowAttentionHandler.js\n\nThis includes an event handler method called \"_onWindowDemandsAttention\" which sends the notification. A quick and dirty test by commenting out the responsible code in this method leads to what I want: no more \"Application xyz is ready\" notification any longer.\nFor not to be such dirty by hacking the original sources I want to write a little shell extension which overloads the \"WindowAttentionHandler._onWindowDemandsAttention\" method with nothing more than a simple \"return\". \nIt can be read here - under \"How extends functionality\" that one can simply overload a function by using the .prototype. After researching the correct syntax I now have an extension with this simple code in extension.js just for testing if it works:\nconst WindowAttentionHandler = imports.ui.windowAttentionHandler;\n\nfunction init() {\n}\n\nfunction enable() {\nWindowAttentionHandler.WindowAttentionHandler.prototype._onWindowDemandsAttention=function(display, window) { \n                return;\n        }\n}\n\nfunction disable() {\n}\n\nEnabling the extension and restarting gnome shell raises no error (nothing in gnome session logs or in LookingGlass) BUT it doesn't work either: The \"Application xyz is ready\" notifications are still appearing.\nI can make sure that the extension is really loaded by adding some debug output ( log(\"BLAA\") ) in the \"init\" or \"enable\" functions.\nAny hint what I am doing wrong? Or do I have to use a different solution?\n\nA: Most likely the handler is already instantiated at the time your extension overrides the template from which it was already constructed. You will need to hunt down the running instance and override that, not the library template.\n", "Q: Remove RECYCLER directory from virus infected flash drive Before you advise me on the option of saving my files and formatting the drive using gparted, please understand that I could have done that hours back and that would have taken only a few minutes. Actually, I want to understand, what is really happening here. The situation is trashing all my experiences gained  over the years.\n\nI was under the impression that if I insert a virus infected flash drive to my Ubuntu machine, all I need to do is to simply delete the virus files and I am good to go. \nToday, I collected some files in an NTFS formatted flash drive from a Windows machine fully knowing that the machine is virus infected.

However, it fails to find a threat.\nI understand that I can simply save my flash drive contents somewhere and then format it.

(And definitely, I  will want to disinfect my flash drive as well.)\n\nUPDATE 1\nFurther to the comment from Patro.\n\n\n*\n\n*When the folders are visited, those files with myriad attributes are not shown, even when I try to view them as hidden files.\n\n*Deleting these files fails.

There has not been any improvement.\n\nUPDATE 3 (SOLVED)\nAs advised in this post, I inserted my drive in a Windows machine and\nexecuted (from a terminal),\nchkdsk <drive letter> /R\n\nThere was a flurry of activities about checking and repairing. There were some messages regarding bad sectors as well. The task\nwas finished in less than a minute.\nThen I found that some new folders have been created for recovered areas.\nI reinserted the flash drive to a Linux machine, and the RECYCLER folder could be deleted without any problem.\nAs an added step, now I have formatted the drive (using gparted, to NTFS) since I think that I have gained my insight.\nLooks like the virus is indeed capable of causing (temporary/soft) hardware\nproblem. Please see the above mentioned post for a detailed technical explanation.\n\nA: Ok I gotta clear a couple of things here:\n\n\n*\n\n*The reverse-engineer part about NTFS does not apply here, especially for a formatted NTFS flash drive. Even if it did that would be something really out of the normal. I have worked with many NTFS formatted Flash drives, formatted in Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. \nSo a problem with the Linux not detecting NTFS correctly is not it. the NTFS-3G proyect is not slow nor incompatible to that level, you can even see that the last update was a couple of months ago this same year. It sure has a couple of issues from time to time like caching support and huge CPU usage, but like I said, for a Flash Drive it would be something very unlikely to happen or would be with a very small chance..\n\n*I have had similar problems with Flash drives showing either ????? symbols or simply wrong symbols altogether (EG: !@#%$@%#@ instead of the filename). Some users recommend using ntfsfix or ntfck but if you can't fix them with that run chkdsk on Windows on the drive. The Boot record/filesystem for it might be having some issues.\n\n*The owner of the file/folder does not matter as long as he uses sudo. It could be any user but when he uses the sudo command rm will remove it regardless of who owns it. Again this applies to this NTFS formatted Flash drive.\n\n*When I first saw the question I was going to ask to run the command as sudo but I read you already did. Then was going to suggest the ntfs repair tools, but you already did. then I saw the Input/output error at the end. That and seeing how the name of the files appeared all messed up simply told me there was an actual filesystem problem which can be corrected only by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using chkdsk on Windows. Neither ntfsfix nor ntfsck will fix a couple of issues that chkdsk can only fix.\n\n*At this moment it does not look like a hardware problem, more likely a filesystem problem. If chkdsk does not work, then the only solution is to format the flash drive again (No need for low level). In the case a simple format does not help (and tested in Windows and gparted), then we are looking at a hardware level problem.\nIf a virus actually had to do anything with this problem, it would be because it affected/attached to the filesystem table (MFT). This would create problems like seeing parts of the filesystem OK and others BAD. Not seeing files on one system and seeing them in another. Seeing all files or some corrupted (eg:!@#!#!LOL!@#!) and other weird stuff that could happen if the file system table is corrupt. It could be as simple as the virus changing one of the fields in the filesystem table or it could be as horrible as the virus changing the size of the MFT or several files.\nVirus aside you should know that if the problem is so bad that you can't format the drive (Fresh filesystem) which would be rare to see a virus do that, then it is more probable that you have a flash drive hardware problem caused by heat, impact, etc..\nFor the corruption of data on the flash drive, or in any storage unit but especially flash drives, the cause in many cases is removing the unit before all information was correctly saved. This can happen in both, Windows and Linux if a user removes the flash drive without making sure that everything has finished writing and the session for the device is closed.\nIn the case of Linux you will start getting warnings about read/write operations not permitted in the whole flash drive or files (like movies) missing 50% of more of the whole size (Like a 1.2GB movie weighing only 500MB and everything in it corrupted). fsck can fix this in most cases. In the case of Windows it will show input/output errors and can go as far as corrupting the whole unit because the MFT did not save correctly the info. So it is recommend to either wait for the session to close or use a \"safely remove\" option when available.\n\nA: I think that the problem is that the NTFS implementation in Linux is reverse-engineered and not complete --- ask Microsoft for the source code ;-). \nYou have hints with the \"Unsupported case found\" warning. Probably the Windows machine antivirus used some advanced/obscure NTFS filesystem characteristics that the Linux driver is not able to grasp. \nYou should do low-level management of a filesystem on the native system only (search here how often gparted resized an NTFS partition only to make the system unbootable...). \nSee also the main NTFS-3g page, and especially this FAQ Q&A.\n", "Q: Windows 7 not recognised in installation I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 to dual boot on this Windows 7 64 bit laptop, but it didn't recognise Windows.

Is it possible without doing a clean install (installing 14.04 on top of 12.04)?\nThanks.\n\nA: When you do a distro upgrade nobody can guarantee, that nothing will break.\nI would recommend to create a backup image of your hard drive with clonezilla (Its a special linux live system for image-based snapshots) and save it to an external usb drive, for example.\nThen, if anything breaks, you can easily roll back the saved image and everything will be as before the upgrade.\nIf you like to learn how to use clonezillea, you can watch tutorials such as this one, google for tutorials, and try to backup and restore in a virtual machine.\n\nA: \nThis is my work laptop and I need to make sure that nothing will\n  break.\n\nIt can never be guaranteed that nothing will break. If you use your system for work, and any amount of downtime is unacceptable, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install on another PC\n\n*Install on another (possibly new) hard drive\n\n*Install on your existing harddrive but on another partition (if you have used LVM for your existing install, then create a new LVM Logical Volume)\n\n*Take a full backup of your existing parition, install over it, and if it fails, then restore the backup\n\n\nOn my work system, I have multiple 8GB partitions for base installs of different operating systems, and I always do a fresh install of the new system onto an empty partition.

My Asus laptop makes a high pitch squeeking noise/sound.\nIt turns out that is has something to do with the CPU and its power saving settings. I have my laptop on dual-boot with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nFor Windows 7 I found this applicable and working solutions; now how can I fix this irritating sound in Ubuntu?\n\nA: What you are hearing are probably the coils of the CPU power converter, when the CPU switches between powersaving modes, so in order to get rid of the sound you have to disable the powersaving modes, which will have a negative impact on power draw.\nIn order to do this, you have to add the kernel cmdline option cpuidle_sysfs_switch to your bootloader configuration. Then you can disable modes by writing a 1 to the disable files in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/stateX/.\nFirst change to root by running sudo -i, then disable states with, for example,  echo 1 >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state3/disable.\nYou'll have to try which powerstates you have to disable. Once you have figured it out, you can make the changes permanent by adding the command lines to /etc/rc.local, before the last line, which by default is exit 0.\nThe official documentation can be found here.\n", "Q: aod255 netbook wireless connection legitimation problem Following problem:\nI tried to install ubuntu 14.04 lts on an Acer Aspire One D255 because the pre-installed windows 7 starter was running annoyingly slow. ubuntu is way faster, but now I got a new problem: I can't connect to the wireless lan.

While installing Ubuntu 13.04, I accidentally selected the option to erase everything on the disk and install Ubuntu, and as a result, my entire hard-disk was formatted as one partition on which Ubuntu was installed(Thus, no Windows now).\nAfter booting up the laptop, an error comes as \"No boot device found. Press any key to reboot.\" This probably happens because Windows is no longer there, and it's bootloader is still there(?). To boot to Ubuntu, I have to either select it manually in the boot options menu during startup by pressing the F12 key, or by setting up the boot option in my BIOS settings to UEFI instead of Legacy. If I select the UEFI boot option, then it directly boots up into Ubuntu, and this is what I'm currently using. I recently upgraded my Ubuntu to 14.04, and the situation is still the same.\nNow, I want to install Windows 8.1 over my current system(along with Ubuntu 14.04). The problem is I already have a Windows bootloader(?) that's somehow left because of formatting of the hard-disk previously. I don't want to take any chances, so I'm posting this question.\nI have the image file(iso) of Windows 8.1.

This results in the \"No boot device found\" error message, because there's no BIOS/CSM/legacy boot loader. (Windows 8 and later are almost always installed in EFI mode on new hardware, so there would be no BIOS-mode boot loader when you bought the computer.) Adjusting your boot options to boot in EFI/UEFI mode by default (or equivalently, to disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support; the phrasing varies from one EFI to another) would probably get rid of the issue.\nMoving forward, if I'm right about this, it's critical that you install Windows in EFI/UEFI mode. If you attempt to install in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, Windows will complain about your GUID Partition Table (GPT) and refuse to install. Leaving BIOS-mode boot options active in your firmware might cause this to happen.\nIf I'm right, your computer already has the EFI System Partition (ESP) to which oldfred alluded. Windows and Ubuntu can share a single ESP. You will need to have either unallocated space or a ready-made NTFS partition for Windows' use, so you'll probably have to use GParted, as mrsud suggests, to prepare your disk. You'll need to do this from an Ubuntu live disk, since GParted can't modify any partition that's currently in use. Rather than use Boot Repair to restore GRUB, I recommend using bcdedit in Windows, since this is a more minimal option that's less likely to cause follow-on problems.\nAs a precaution, back up your ESP (/boot/efi from Ubuntu) to a USB flash drive or some other removable medium. That way, you can restore it in case the Windows installer trashes it. For that matter, backing up all your important user data is also advisable.\nBefore proceeding, you may want to check your boot mode and partition table type. When you boot Ubuntu in EFI mode, a directory called /sys/firmware/efi should be present. Look for it to verify that you're in EFI mode. To check your partition table, type sudo parted /dev/sda print. You should see output resembling the following:\n$ sudo parted /dev/sda print\nModel: ATA ST3000DM001-1CH1 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 3001GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B\nPartition Table: gpt\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                 Flags\n 1      20.5kB  577MB   577MB   fat32        EFI System           boot\n 2      578MB   1102MB  524MB   ext2         Ubuntu /boot\n 3      1102MB  1626MB  524MB                Unused /boot\n 4      1626MB  3001GB  2999GB               Linux LVM            lvm\n\nYours will be different in many details from mine, but note the Partition Table line, which identifies the partition table as GPT or MBR (which shows as msdos, IIRC). Note also the FAT32 partition with the boot flag set -- that's the ESP. (Its entry in the Name column is descriptive for humans, and might not read EFI System, as mine does.)\nIf you don't have a /sys/firmware/efi directory and/or if your disk does not use GPT, then my interpretation of what you've written is wrong, and you should post back with details. (Edit your original question.) In this case, ignore everything I've written here -- or file it away for future reference -- since it doesn't apply if you've actually installed Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\nA: Create a partition using gparted and then install windows in it. Later you may use boot-repair to get your grub back.\n\nA: Windows in UEFI mode also needs a reserved partition and it must be just before the NTFS partition.\nI would suggest just to install Windows into unallocated space. \nMicrosoft suggested partitions including reserved partition for gpt & UEFI:\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744301%28WS.10%29.aspx\nOrder on drive is important: msftres\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Reserved_Partition\nThe efi partition still has the old entries which a new install should overwrite. But UEFI also remembers settings from efi partition in its NVRAM. Windows should also refresh that or you may need to update it manually with efibootmgr or from inside your UEFI if you have an UEFI with better menu options.\n\nA: If you are using the EFI / UEFI boot instead of the boot loader (eg. GRUB) of the HD, please disregard this answer.\nI would burn the .iso to DVD, then follow the advice above concerning setting the BIOS the way you want it. I would install the Windows 8.1 first, having it delete all partitions and then create one partition from half the drive. Do all the Windows stuff first, ignoring the unused half of the drive, and once the Windows is working and updated then install the Linux.\n", "Q: where can I download xsltproc that is compatible with ubuntu 12.04 Where can I download xsltproc that is compatible with Ubuntu 12.04?

I also ordered a bluetooth keyboard.  When I start the bluetooth app in Ubuntu, it quickly finds the keyboard.  When I try to pair with it, though, it generates a number for me to type on the keyboard.  I type the number, press ENTER, and yet it fails to pair.\nWhat could be the problem here?\n(Incidentally, after much gnashing of teeth, I inadvertently managed to completely wipe out the Windows 8.1 that came with the computer so it's all Ubuntu now.)\nEDIT:\nHmm:  I see a lock on the Bluetooth indicator.  This sounds like it could be related.  Not sure what to do about it.  I didn't see anything about locking in the bluetooth app.  I'm a bluetooth noob, by the way.\n\nA: The workaround that I am using works as follows.\n1) Figure out the Bluetooth address of your keyboard. I think I used blueman to do that. The address should look like this 23:AF:61:45:E8:3C (This is just an example)\n2) Run the following two commands in a terminal. Use the address you determined beforehand.\nsudo hciconfig hci0 up\nsudo hidd --connect 23:AF:61:45:E8:3C\n\nThat should connect your device.\n3) optional. You can put those commands in a .sh file and make it executable to save you from typing them repeatedly.\n\nA: On the connect new bt device (the + sign under the bt settings) Select the type of device and also the pin the device is looking for (0000, 1234, etc.).  That is the typical way to get the pair to work.  Doesn't work anymore for me though, so good luck.  There are other BT problems with the battery indicator which make my mouse not work (bug filed).  If you get it paired, and it still doesn't work, take a look at hcidump and see if you see the clicks/move signals -- if so and the cursor isn't moving, probably the battery indicator is grabbing the signals looking for bt battery state, and not requeueing the moves.  Another machine will work with the mouse until the battery indicator finds the mouse battery and starts processing, then the cursor stops moving.\n\nA: This post on the RedHat bug tracker really helped me solve my problem.

I think Intel still leases x64 from AMD...\nYou do not need a Mac-specific image, and you definitely want the x64 version.\n\nBackup, backup, backup!\nNo matter how many people have successfully installed Ubuntu alongside OSX, there is still a very real possibility of losing everything on your hard disk, so please, do the prudent thing and make a full backup before proceeding!\n\nNote: You need to install rEFInd to get a boot menu on startup.\nHere's a guide on how to do that, taken from the How-To-Geek:\n\nrEFInd is a boot manager that will allow you to choose between Mac OS\n  X, Linux, Windows, and other operating systems when you boot your\n  computer. Installing rEFInd makes the dual-boot process easier. (Some\n  older how-to’s will instruct you to use rEFIt, but it’s no longer\n  maintained. rEFInd is a currently maintained boot manager based on\n  rEFIt.)\nFull-disk encryption causes problems with rEFIt, so you’ll need to\n  disable full-disk encryption or do some extra work before installing\n  rEFInd.\nFirst, visit the rEFInd page on SourceForge and click the Download\n  button to download the latest refind-bin-[version].zip file. Open a\n  Terminal window by pressing Command+Space and, typing Terminal, and\n  pressing Enter. Drag and drop the install.sh file from the downloaded\n  zip file into the terminal window and press Enter to run it.\n\nShut down your Mac — a full shut down, not a restart — and boot it\n  back up again. You should see the rEFInd boot manager screen.\n\n\n\nNow for the actual install:\nWhile the ISO is downloading, use Disk Utility to partition your HDD. Make sure to leave the partition you create as \"Free Space\". (No filesystem)\n\nAfter you download the ISO, burn it to a blank DVD.\nIf you'd like to burn it to a USB stick instead, see: https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\nNext, hold down the Option key while hitting the power button. Continue to hold it down until you get the boot device selection menu. Then you want to choose \"EFI Boot\". It will show a picture of a DVD if you burned it to a DVD, and it will show a picture of a drive if you burned it to a USB stick.\n\nAfter the installer loads, select the \"Install Ubuntu\" option, and then select \"Install Alongside Mac OSX\". Hopefully, it will automatically install to the partition you left as \"Free Space\" earlier.\n\nAfter it installs, shut down and remove the installation media. Then reboot, and cross your fingers. Hopefully you'll see this:\n\nIf after installing your Wi-Fi doesn't work:\nThen you should post a new question on this site, including the version of Ubuntu you installed, whether you have a working Ethernet port, and the output of these two terminal commands:\nlspci -nnk | grep 0280 -A2\nrfkill list all\n\nAnd I'm sure Pilot6 or Chili555 will be glad to assist you! Make sure you add the wireless tag!\n\nA: *\n\n*Download the refind binary zip on OS X\n\n*Unpack it and run install.sh (on OS X)\n\n*Use OS X Disk Utility to resize your HFS+ partition\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a partition for Ubuntu (create two partitions if you want a swap partition). Choose any partition type (it does not matter because you will overwrite them later).\n\n\n*Download Ubuntu 14.04 amd64 iso image and write it to a USB flash drive\n\n*Reboot and hold option key after you hear the bell, to start Startup Manager\n\n*Insert USB drive and select it. Ubuntu 14.04 installer will start.\n\n*At partitioning stage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select manual partitioning\n\n*Select the partition that you created in Disk Utility as your / (and set up swap if you created a partition for it)\n\n\n*At Grub install stage, Grub will detect an EFI system and install a boot loader to the EFI partition on /dev/sda1\n\n*At end of install, remove USB drive and reboot\n\n*Refind will load and show you the option of booting OS X or Ubuntu. Choose Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Xubuntu blank screen after wakeup Xubuntu 14.04. After wake up from sleep, it asks to enter password. I entered the passw. and screen goes black. On Ubuntu 14.04 waking up was just ok. Lenovo E330 laptop with intel HD graphics.\nadd: If lid was closed, not clicked sleep\n\nA: This is all great and fine. But for a noob or anyone who is not accustomed to CLI it doesn't make the problem any less bothersome. Here is the solution that worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely remove Light Locker using Synaptic Package Manager\n\n*Install Gnome Screensaver from the Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Restart the computer\n\n\nA: Strangely, one day when I fresh installed Xubuntu, that problem stopped. Still, if this happen, try using the following tip:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get into the command line using Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\n*Put your credentials user/password.\n\n*Write the following:\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nSo it will take you back to the login screen.\nHope that helps! (It's not a fix for this problem, though. I had to get used to click the Suspend button instead of closing the lid.)\n\nA: Easier way:\nSwitch to different session using Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or F2-F6)\nand then back to your session using Ctrl+Alt+F7\n\nA: I was able to work around the problem by going into settings, opening \"Light Locker Settings\" and setting \"Enable light-locker\" to off.\nLearn more about light locker at http://xubuntu.org/news/screen-locking-in-xubuntu-14-04/\n\nA: My Lenovo E531 does the same. I insert the password and the screen goes black. Then I press the power button, I enter the password (again!) and everything it's fine. I know it's not the answer you needed, it's just a workaround than works for me. I hope it will help you too.\n\nA: Had the same problem too. My solution was on Light Locker Settings too but I didn't disable light locker. I just enabled \"Lock on suspend\" and the problem solved.\n\nA: The answer from WolfangAukang helped me. But in my case, it was sddm which had to be restarted.\nGet into the command line using Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nPut your credentials user/password.\nWrite the following:\nsudo service sddm restart\n\nSo it will take you back to the login screen.\n\nA: Seems to be a bug in light-locker on most laptops. A workaround is, using suspend instead of xflock4. This can be achieved changing the next three options in XFCE4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Whiskers menu > right click > settings > commands > lock screen -> and write 'systemctl suspend' instead of 'xflock4'\n\n*Settings panel > power manager > security > lock session automatically > never\n\n*Settings panel > session and start > advanced > lock screen before suspend > unchecked\n\n\nAn easier workaround is just installing xscreensaver. It's ugly, but it works.\n", "Q: When I create .desktop files, they don't get found by Trusty's Dash Magnifier not found by Trusty's Dash though Manage Launcher (both variants) are.\nI've tried creating Magnifier.desktop both with Manage Launcher, Manage Launcher (Administrator) & Arronax.\nroot@JohnDesktop:/home/john# ls -l /usr/share/applications/Ma*\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 142 May  7 15:35 /usr/share/applications/Magnifier.desktop\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 322 Oct  1  2013 /usr/share/applications/Manage Launcher (Administrator).desktop\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 281 Oct  1  2013 /usr/share/applications/Manage Launcher.desktop\n\n\nA: How about making them executable?

I tried again and was successful, but then realised that I still had the partition from the previous attempt. I have tried to use gparted to shrink this partition in order to expand that of the successful installation, but it won't allow me to do so (resize option greyed out). I also tried deleting all the items contained therein - they no longer show in nautilus, but the free space has not increased). How can I combine these two partitions?\n\nA: *\n\n*Run gparted from a live cd. \n\n*Delete the partition you do not want.\n\n*Resize the other partition to take up all of the available free\nspace.\n\n*Reinstall grub (unless you have /boot on the first disk partition)\n\n*Reboot\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu cope with bad RAM? I have installed Ubuntu on a computer which hat bad/defective RAM (memtest86+) showed that later. \nThe thing is I did not have any problems with Ubuntu 14.04 while Windows 7 installed on the same machine bluescreen crashed constantly. I know that there is a Badblocks/badRAM feature possible in the linux kernel and in grub.\nCan somebody confirm that the good (in comparison with windows 7) crash-free experience was more than just luck? I.e. does ubuntu probe RAM during install/boot and prevent defective RAM to disrupt system stability? Or was I just lucky that Ubuntu did not crash?\n\nA: It can cope with bad ram, but not out of the box.\nI found the easiest and most robust way for me is to add a kernel parameter memtest=4 to my Grub config. This adds a couple of seconds to bootup where the kernel checks your ram and then marks them as bad for you \\o/ (thank God as I'm not able to replace my ram in this Covid19 lockdown)\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /etc/default/grub \n\n*update this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash memtest=4\"\n\n*sudo update-grub\n\n*reboot\n\n*optionally check that it is working by running dmesg and see logs like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*[    5.043917]   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bad mem addr 0x0000000581a90000 - 0x0000000581a90010 reserved\nhttps://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2278744\n\nA: Linux does not, by default, do anything that would make it possible to run reliably on a system with bad RAM. The badram project, and other similar projects, come from an era when memory was less reliable and more expensive. You may still be able to still compile it, but most likely you will find that the patches (which the Ubuntu wiki suggests are for kernel 2.6.20 - over 7 years old now) - have suffered bitrot, and nobody cares, because there are only a few people in the world running Linux on systems that are known to have bad memory.\n", "Q: Is it possible to periodically repeat a dhcp request? I have my ubuntu server set to get addresses from a dhcp server.\nHowever, if that dhcp server is not currently active, the server will just stay with no address.\nIs there some mechanism to periodically send dhcp requests? \n\nA: You can use cron for that.\nOpen a console and as root type:\ncrontab -e\n\nInsert a line that executes the dhclient \n\n00 * * * *  dhclient eth0\n\nThis runs the command dhclient for the network card eth0 every hour (00)\nYou must change the time for the one you want, and the network card for yours.\nIf you want to know how cron works:\n\n", "Q: Can't Mount NTFS drive \"The disk contains an unclean file system\" I am getting an error when I try to access my NTFS drive from ubuntu.\nUnable to access “My Drive”\n\nError mounting /dev/sda6 at /media/ubuntu/Media Center: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda6\" \"/media/rolindroy/Media Center\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda6': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

You would have to do those things by booting into Windows.\nYou may also run chkdsk on it from Windows.\nIf you don't have immediate boot access under Windows for the drive, do as the message says and mount it as read only.\nThen access the drive and copy the important data.  You can then repair the drive under Ubuntu by reformatting the partition and bring the backed up data back.\nMounting drive as read only:\n$ sudo mount -o ro /dev/[partition /media/[mounting point]\n\nAnother option is to repair the disk under Ubuntu with ntfsfix:\n$ ntfsfix /dev/[partition]\n\n\nA: This should be because your \"Windows\" system is in a intermediate state (not a full shutdown of system before powering off the hard drive, like using hibernation for example).\nRestart on Windows, shutdown down system fully and it should work.\nIf you try this on a command line term session, you should have this kind of explanation\nDo:\nsudo mount -o ro /dev/[partition /media/[mounting point]\n\nThe output will be:\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. \nPlease resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), \nor mount the volume read-only with the `ro` mount option.\n\n\nA: Log on to windows and then restart to Ubuntu. Works for me!

Is it normal that now is it disappeared? Is there a way to add this button?\n\nA: That button has been replaced by a standard menu, which will be (by default) the global menu at the top of the screen or (if changed) in the title bar.\nNot sure if the menu is laid out the same or not, but no functionality is removed with this change.\n\nA: Just a thought here\nI just installed mine and the gear icon exists\nso I figure since I have default options\nif you launch dconf editor\nand set defaults\nto all tabs\nunder gnome > nautilus \nwith \nnautilus -q\n\nand open nautilus\ncould it be related to this bug ??\npic\nit seems that they are working on it \ndid you tried nemo and things are missing there too ??\n\nA: Combining NGRhodes and billybadass's answers, I can confirm that this is a Unity-only feature. Upstream GNOME nautilus still has this feature and this feature has specifically been changed for users using Unity. The gear icon has been removed in Unity to combine them in the menu bars- all features of the gear icon are in the respective menus.\nI confirmed this with the nautilus mailing provide and will soon attach the respective mails(it seems like they are not in Google's index right now, so you won't get them googling). Posting a part of the mail here, for you reference, replied by Emmanuele Bassi, the Director at GNOME Foundation:\n\nit(The gear icon)'s still there. I think Ubuntu is patching out some stuff related to\n  header bars, but that's a Ubuntu-only thing, and upstream GNOME has\n  nothing to do with it.\n\nThe easiest but the most undesirable way would be switch to GNOME(no one would do that for the gear icon, I believe). I'll update my answer as soon as I find a way, if possible, to get this gear icon back on Unity.\n\nA: As far as I know... with nautilus 3.10 in Ubuntu 14.04 there is a new patch to the source named restore-traditional-menu-bar.patch to bring back the \"File | Edit | View | Go | Bookmarks | Help\" menus instead the new \"View\" & \"Location\" buttons.\n\nIn Nautilus 3.6, introduced in raring, the menu layout was changed\n  from the traditional all-entries-in-one-menubar to:\n  * an application menu called \"Files\" in the Unity menu bar\n  * a view menu has moved to some toolbar buttons and a dropdown under an arrow in the upper right of a window\n  * all other menu items have moved to a cog button dropdown in the upper right of a window\nFor Unity, we should probably switch back to the more traditional\n  layout (and keep the new layout for GNOME). I'll assign an Ayatana\n  task to get design guidance on what the layout should be.\n------------------------ Desired resolution:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Remove the 'cog' icon from the top right of the Nautilus toolbar. Move the view and search buttons over to the right, so that the right\n  most view button occupies the position which previously held the cog\n  button.\n  \n\nIn this way if you are using Unity you have the traditional menu, but if you are using gnome, gnome-session-flashback you have the new menu buttons.\nNautilus in Unity:\n\nNautilus in Gnome-Flashback:\n\nIf you want to have the traditional menu with the new buttons in Unity...You can try to edit the nautilus source code.\nNOTE: I recommend you to do this in a Virtual Machine or in a Test Machine to see is everything is OK.\nIn this example I'm running Ubuntu \"14.04\" with \"nautilus 3.10.1\".\n1) Make sure you have enable the Source code repository\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*In the Menu Bar choose Edit -> Software Sources.

Why is that ? and what can I do to update the kernel from terminal.\n\nA: apt-get upgrade won't install new software or remove software, something you must when installing a new kernel... See the thread.\nA thing you can do (taken from this thread, read full for more):\nUse aptitude:\nsudo aptitude update\nsudo aptitude safe-upgrade\nsudo aptitude full-upgrade\n\nYou could also use sudo apt-get dist-upgrade instead of sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nA: You need to perform dist-upgrade inorder to install/remove all dependencies related to the packages upgraded using upgrade. From the manual page of apt-get:\n\n  dist-upgrade\n       dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of\n       upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies\n       with new versions of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\"\n       conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade\n       the most important packages at the expense of less\n       important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may\n       therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list\n       file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve\n       desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a\n       mechanism for overriding the general settings for\n       individual packages.\n\n\nSo, the better way of upgrading would be:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nHowever, be careful while using dist-upgrade as it might also remove packages to satisfy dependencies.\n", "Q: Meaning of different icons for USB flash drives Ubuntu uses at least three different icons for identifying USB storages. What are the criteria used to diferentiate those?\n\n\nFor instance, I have two nearly identical Sandisk Cruzer Blade USB drives, one 4 GB and other 8 GB. (The output of lsusb is the same for both: Bus 001 Device 009: ID 0781:5567 SanDisk Corp. Cruzer Blade). On Linux, one is displayed with the flash drive icon and other with the generic USB storage icon. Sometimes a third, purple icon is used too.\nWhat is the cause of this behavior? Are there other icons? What are the rules for Ubuntu picking different USB drive icons and what do they mean?\n\nA: Ubuntu differentiates between filesystem builds (ISO formats) and displays the relevant icon. \nThe standard USB icon is for generic removable media devices. The one with the purple usb stick is for UDF filesystems (Info here). The larger icon is for mass storage devices.\nYou may come across any of these depending on the hardware specifications of the device.\n\nA: The icons appear based upon the partition type of the device.  As of Ubuntu 21.10, older types show a rectangle with a USB symbol and newer types show a USB image with a connector at the bottom.\nAs of this moment, on my Ubuntu 21.10 system, they are (as listed in Disks app):\n W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n Basic Data, NTFS/exFAT/HPFS, UDF\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 repeats the background voice for every input I have installed the Ubuntu 14.04 before a week, when ever I gave an input action it is repeated over male voice.\nExample: if I press the F5 key then Ubuntu produce the male voice as \"f5\".

I hope this helps someone.\n\nEditor's Addition (by Anwar)\nIt's the installation of gnome packages and not removing them cleanly. gnome-control-center is GNOME3 sessions part and not meant to be used in Unity. \n\nA: \nIs there another way to reach it ... ?\n\nI think you can directly access it through Software & Updates either from the dashboard or from the System Settings panel (in the shutdown button).\nNow for the second part of the problem:\nTry reinstalling ubuntu-desktop as proposed here\n\nA: In Kubuntu 14.04 use Muon Discover.

I've recently set up a headless server to back up a number of very large film & editing files.\nI SSH into the server and - following some best practice guides I found around - I've tightened security so that the server auto logs me off after 5 minutes of inactivity.\nThis is now creating a bit of a headache as I try to sort and move those files. \nIssuing mv file1 /new_directory/ can take +5 mins and so I'm often logged off half way through.\nWhere multiple files are involved I've come back to find that some files seem to have transferred and others (at a seemingly arbitrary cut off point... or roughly what I reckon a 5 min timeout might have allowed) have not.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*When issuing a mv command, if it is cancelled whilst incomplete is there any risk of data loss? Might I be safer using cp?\n\n*Is there any way that I could set a cp or mv command to go and then be sure that it will continue even after I've logged off or my ssh window has closed\n\n*Is there a way to do other things whilst a mv or cp is taking place (and thus refresh my countdown timer)\n\n\nA: Don't log in as such. Instead, from your local machine, run\nssh user@server mv /path/to/source /path/to/dest\n\nThat should let you get around the problem.\nOn a more general note, I do believe you are being a bit paranoid here. Setting the idle time to 5 minutes and then facing this kind of issue seems silly. Just set it to something longer and avoid the problem. \nAs for your 1st question, mv will only delete the source files if the copy succeeded. As explained in info mv (emphasis mine):\n\nIt first uses some of the same code that's used by `cp -a'\n  to copy the requested directories and files, then (assuming the copy\n  succeeded) it removes the originals.  If the copy fails, then the part\n  that was copied to the destination partition is removed.  If you were\n  to copy three directories from one partition to another and the copy of\n  the first directory succeeded, but the second didn't, the first would\n  be left on the destination partition and the second and third would be\n  left on the original partition.\n\n\nA: It is highly recommended to do long-running admin tasks only with tmux or screen (or Xvnc if you need it graphically). This shields you from network disconnects and allows reconnect. You could also use mosh, which is robust against network outages.\nIf you do not care so much about continue the session after your command has terminated, you can also run it detached with nohup mv ... (optional ending with & to background it immediatelly). You then need to monitor its execution with ps. Some shells can detach a running program (disown or not kill them like zsh's setipt NO_HUP) or use a background starter like at or cron.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04: how to enable hibernate?

So, what I would like to know is if it's ok to just select the Delete boot option for both of them.\n\n\nA: In short: Yes.\nTo elaborate a bit: Those boot options are stored in your motherboard's NVRAM, and point to files on your hard disk that either no longer exist or that are non-functional if they still exist. Deleting those entries (using efibootmgr from a Linux live CD, bcfg from an EFI shell, or sometimes from the EFI setup utility's built-in user interface) will simply delete something non-functional.

There's also another free application, called Paragon Extfs, which is able to read and write files on ext partitions, but it's known to break some Linux installations.\n", "Q: Unity launcher stays behind windows I have been having a problem with Unity launcher recently. Launcher stay behind my windows and I can't bring it to the front of my windows! \n\nAs you can see, the Nautilus window is in front of the launcher menu and the menus are totally inaccessible when the window is maximized.\n\nA: Open your terminal by pressing Ctrl +  Alt + T and type this following to solve this problem:\nunity&disown\n\nHit Enter to generating this commands, you'll see screen will flick a few times, just don't panic ! Wait for a few second and everything will back to normal again\n\nA: This was resolved for me after shutting down and restarting. The Unity application launcher now correctly appears in front of any other window.\nFor me the unity&disown solution didn't work - it actually made the entire unity UI permanently disappear until restarted, including the top part of every window with the close, minimize and maximize buttons. Even after waiting ~20 minutes the UI didn't reappear and I couldn't close any windows to see if there was possibly a dialog box waiting for my response hidden somewhere, so I had to force a shutdown by holding the power button for 4+ seconds.\nThe issue occurred after suspending and waking up my machine several times, although I'm not positive the two events are correlated.\nHope this helps anyone else having trouble with the unity&disown solution.\n", "Q: Why does Lubuntu not respect my keyboard preferences? I’ve just installed Lubuntu 14.04 on my laptop (replacing the previous dual boot Ubuntu 13.10 / Windows 7, which my poor little laptop really didn’t have the space for). As part of the installation process, I was asked to select my keyboard layout. I selected Irish, and double-checked that the problematic keys (\", @, €) worked correctly. Everything seemed fine.\nNow that the installation is complete, however, I have a US keyboard with no obvious way to change it (and no obvious way to type the € symbol). I am, of course, interested in fixing this, but I’d also like to know why this happened in the first place.\n\nA: Right click on the Keyboard Layout Handler icon in your LXPanel.  Choose Keyboard Layout Handler settings.  Untick Keep system layouts and then click add.  Choose Irish which I believe will show up as ie.  You can then move it to the top to have it be the default or keep it where it is and just toggle when you need it.  Check Keep system layouts.  I believe that it will not take effect until the next boot.\n", "Q: Corebird twitter client for Ubuntu 14.04 I have recently installed ubuntu on my laptop (wubi method) and I'm very pleased.

I can see DHCP and DNS traffic when I look at tun0 (notebook's internal). When I explore wlan0 traffic (external between notebook and WiFi router) I only get grey TCP packages.\nI think it's happening because DNS-query isn't needed in characters-to-numbers decoding and it goes in common stream like a usual data package.\nI'll be glad to know your considerations, it will not be surprise if I'm completely wrong\n\nA: I faced the same problem and found out when using the PiVPN setup script for Open VPN, the server config contains the line:\npush \"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp\"\n\nalready.\nOn the IOS client everything is routed through the tunnel automatically (that is what the log says).\nOn the Tunnelblick client you need to add this line in the client.ovpn file:\nredirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp\n\nand it should work perfectly. At least it did on my Mac.\n\nA: On server side find server.conf file and just add this line into it\npush \"redirect-gateway autolocal\"\n\nIt will redirect all client side traffic trough tunnel\n\nA: If your OpenVPN client is on Windows 10 (or similar) there is another issue to watch out for, the binding order of the NICs.  The existing DNS server settings on the LAN or Wifi adapter may take priority over the DNS server settings for the tunnel interface, so even though everything is set up corectly from an OpenVPN point of view, Windows continues to use the original DNS server.\nYou can fix this as described in this Microsoft forum post.\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/1cc5b647-6e51-482b-8998-ac5c3900938c/how-to-force-vpn-clients-to-use-the-dnsserver-from-their-vpn-adapter-not-the-dnsserver-from-their?forum=winserverNIS\n", "Q: iptables command to give internet to my guest OS via virtual box Based on this link there is a difference between Host-only network and NAT.

Please advise.\n\nA: No,\nthere is not trick to find the initial password [1].\nBut to solve your actual problem, you do not need that [2].\nImportant: before continuing here, try if the answers on \nHow do I reset a lost administrative password? make sense to you. If yes, use them. Otherwise, continue here, I will give you some context to understand what problem you need to solve, and propose an approach to start.\nNormally, an Ubuntu system used by one person has a user name, and a password for that user name, defined during setup. That password can be used to log in at startup, and to allow actions that change system data.\nBut - important -  it can not be used to log in as the system administrator with the user name \"root\", as you could expect from similar unix-like systems.\nOn an Ubuntu system, user root normally can not log in at all in the usual sense of loging in. \nSo if you are looking for the root password - that does not even exist. You need the user name, and the password for that user, to log in. \nBut if you can not get hold of that password, you can forget about the normal login, and find another way. \nYou could start the system independently of the installed OS, and reset the password to nothing, or set a password choose.\nTo have the programs you may need available, use an Ubuntu live DVD (or CD, USB-stick etc.) to boot it as an independent OS, that just happens to be a similar version. Then, you have a clean system running, that you are fully in control of.\nIn your situation, it would be good to use the opportunity to start getting used to the system. One reason is that it's nice that you can try things that may mess up your system, and just restart if tha happens. The other reason is that you now have a simple, normal system, while the old system may have personal configuration changes that could confuse you (and people trying to help).\nNow you need to find the hard disk partition that contains the old Ubuntu system, and how to reset the password on that partition, from working from your live CD.\nI'll stop here and refer you to other answers. You could start at the same place I mentioned at the beginning: How do I reset a lost administrative password?.\n(One approach would be to use the method titled \"The Drastic Measures\" from the answer of @keepitsimpleengineer - but it is more difficult than others if you are not used to the system. Of course you can just try again if the old system still does not work because of a typo.)\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no fixed default password in Ubuntu, in case you are looking for that.\n\n*This approach does not work if the harddisk containing the old Ubuntu is encrypted.\n\n\n[1] Except for classic \"hacking\" approaches - like automatically trying all possible short passwords, or all from a list with known common passwords.\n[2] See X/Y problem\n", "Q: Can I send email on the Internet using postfix on a localhost without real hostname?

I just upgraded several PC to Ubuntu Trusty 14.04. For this, I used to install everything from scratch to get a clean system, keeping only /home (and /etc for reference).\nThis time however I upgraded using the upgrade tool, and I want to know what differences my PCs have compared to a nominal system. Because I installed many different packages from different sources, and might have edited some files here and there. Of course I know that apt should handle everything auto-magically, but I'm the paranoid type, and I really want to make sure.\nBasically, here what I'd like to have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a list of all packages installed and for each of them, the repository it is coming from (if available). This would be basically an apt-cache policy for each package, but summarized in a neat list.\n\n*For packages coming from \"unofficial sources\", an indication whether there is a version available from the official sources (I mean the repo listed in /etc/apt/sources.list).\nSometime I installed patched packages from some 3rd-party, and this package is not updated because of conflicting version number. I want to have a list telling me whether it makes sense to fall-back to official version.\n\n*The list of all files on the file system coming from an installed package (incl. configuration files), but that have been modified afterwards.\n\n*The list of all files on the file system (excluding /home, and possibly /etc) that are not coming from an installed package.\nBasically I want to know the differences that my system have if I did the upgrade versus a clean install, and decide on a case by case basis whether these differences might cause some instability.\n\nA: My question is already partially answered at How do I get a list of obsolete packages?.\nThe answers suggest to use\napt-show-versions | grep 'No available version'   # Show all package not coming from repo\naptitude search '~o'                              # Similar\n\nI guess we can do as well:\napt-show-versions | grep -v uptodate              # All packages that are not up-to-date\n\nThis would give packages that are not up-to-date, i.e. packages that are upgradeable from enabled repositories, or packages not coming from such repositories.\nTo get a list of all available versions for such packages, we could do:\napt-show-versions -a $(apt-show-versions | grep -v uptodate | sed -r 's/:.*//')\n\nI also found a question referencing deborphan -a (How to list installed packages in apt that are not backed by a repository?)\ndeborphan -a             # List all packages that have no reverse dependencies\n\nSo to summarize, I have some answers for item 1 and 2, but still looking for 3 and 4:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-show-versions is a good answer\n\n*Idem, one of the command combo above.

I am recently coding a bash script, which I have 26 sets of variables. I'm stuck on this part which I need help with.

What I want to do is this:\nit loops a range just like how you count from 1 to 10, there's only 9 digits. But, in this, i want it to count it as if there were 64. Let's put it like this.\nStarting from \"l1a\", it starts at 0, and keeps adding 1 until it gets to 64, when it gets to 64, it waits until the moment it can tick to 65, but instead of going that far, it checks the successor's (in this case \"l2a\") value, and if it is not 64, it ticks it by 1, and sets l1a to 0, If it is, it checks the next one to see if it's 64 or not, if not, it ticks that by 1 and sets everything before that to 0, if it is, it checks the next, and so on. When it finds one that isn't 64, it ticks it, and every predecessor's value gets changed back to 0. But, if it goes all the way to l26a, and it's 64, as well as all the other digits, it ends the code.\nTHE CODE:\nl1a=0\nl2a=0\nl3a=0\nl4a=0\nl5a=0\nl6a=0\nl7a=0\nl8a=0\nl9a=0\nl10a=0\nl11a=0\nl12a=0\nl13a=0\nl14a=0\nl15a=0\nl16a=0\nl17a=0\nl18a=0\nl19a=0\nl20a=0\nl21a=0\nl22a=0\nl23a=0\nl24a=0\nl25a=0\nl26a=0\nl1b=\"0\"\nl2b=\"0\"\nl3b=\"0\"\nl4b=\"0\"\nl5b=\"0\"\nl6b=\"0\"\nl7b=\"0\"\nl8b=\"0\"\nl9b=\"0\"\nl10b=\"0\"\nl11b=\"0\"\nl12b=\"0\"\nl13b=\"0\"\nl14b=\"0\"\nl15b=\"0\"\nl16b=\"0\"\nl17b=\"0\"\nl18b=\"0\"\nl19b=\"0\"\nl20b=\"0\"\nl21b=\"0\"\nl22b=\"0\"\nl23b=\"0\"\nl24b=\"0\"\nl25b=\"0\"\nl26b=\"0\"\nn=1\nn2=0\np=1\nlet n2 = n + 1\nl=0\nu10=\"_\"\nu11=\"a\"\nu12=\"b\"\nu13=\"c\"\nu14=\"d\"\nu15=\"e\"\nu16=\"f\"\nu17=\"g\"\nu18=\"h\"\nu19=\"i\"\nu20=\"j\"\nu21=\"k\"\nu22=\"l\"\nu23=\"m\"\nu24=\"n\"\nu25=\"o\"\nu26=\"p\"\nu27=\"q\"\nu28=\"r\"\nu29=\"s\"\nu30=\"t\"\nu31=\"u\"\nu32=\"v\"\nu33=\"w\"\nu34=\"x\"\nu35=\"y\"\nu36=\"z\"\nu37=\"A\"\nu38=\"B\"\nu39=\"C\"\nu40=\"D\"\nu41=\"E\"\nu42=\"F\"\nu43=\"G\"\nu44=\"H\"\nu45=\"G\"\nu46=\"H\"\nu47=\"I\"\nu48=\"J\"\nu49=\"K\"\nu50=\"L\"\nu51=\"M\"\nu52=\"N\"\nu53=\"O\"\nu54=\"P\"\nu55=\"Q\"\nu56=\"R\"\nu57=\"S\"\nu58=\"T\"\nu59=\"U\"\nu60=\"V\"\nu61=\"W\"\nu62=\"X\"\nu63=\"Y\"\nu64=\"Z\"\nwhile true; do\n    cd /home/eddy/Pictures/MCSkins/Auto\nlet n = 1\nif [ \"$l\" -lt \"10\" ]; then\n    let l\"$n\"b = l\"$n\"a\nelse\n    let l\"$n\"b = u\"$l\"\nfi\nif [ \"$l\" -le \"64\" ]; then\n    let l = l + 1\nelse\n    if [ \"$l+$p\" -le \"64\" ]; then\n        let \n\n\nA: Ouch!

The\n       default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to\n       the server, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set.  This option\n       applies to protocol version 2 only.  ProtocolKeepAlives and\n       SetupTimeOut are Debian-specific compatibility aliases for this\n       option.\n\nSo, if I'm right, simply adding this line to your /etc/ssh/ssh_config file on the client should fix the issue:\nServerAliveInterval 30\n\nThat will send the keep alive messages every 30 seconds.

I've discovered the minimal iso file and used it to download and install Ubuntu 14.04, but I had some errors running the OS and ended up trying to reinstall, but I realized if I have to keep doing that I'm just re-downloading the same files over and over again. I have 14.04 already downloaded to a USB stick, and I'm just not clear on a simple way to boot with the minimal ISO boot disc and then install files from the USB drive instead of downloading them.\nSorry, I know this question is pretty lame, but any advice would be helpful! Thanks in advance.\nPS: The reason I'm using the minimal ISO instead of just a regular ubuntu ISO is because the CD drive on my laptop is pretty crappy and sometimes stops reading in the middle of an installation. The Minimal iso seems to work better. Also it can't read DVD-R very reliably, but it reads CDRs just fine.\nYes, this is a REALLY old laptop (Compaq Presario R3000 AMD) and I'm just fartin' around with it for fun and enjoyment.\n\nA: Instead of a minimal Ubuntu boot CD, I always use PLoP boot manager from a CD to chainload directly into the USB itself.\nThere's a nice little guide on how to do this here, but all it is, is burning the ISO onto an optical disk (I would use a CD as opposed to a DVD, to support older systems), then boot to it.\n\nA: is the machine so old it doesnt have a usb port? or its not removable media boot capable?\nyou could try a network boot/install, or install from SD/ floppy, and if the smaller version of ubuntu works better and you have limited ram/ disc space i would recommend a different distro, if your well versed in linux arch linux can be fun to play around with,\n\nA: Observation:\nYou mentioned Ubuntu 14.04.\nDid you tried Lubuntu 14.04, or smaller distro like Puppy Linux or Damn Small Linux Linux ?\n", "Q: Samsung Keyboard Brightness Keys So I've recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 (kernel: 3.13.0-24-generic).

Everything still looks crisp and sharp, no complaints on that front.\nMy issue is i have to have a custom script loaded when ubuntu starts that changes the resolution from 3200 to 1920 so when i log in i have to wait for the resolution to change before i log in or else the resolution will stay at 3200 and then i have to change it manually.\nMy question is, is there any way to remove the actual 3200x1800 resolution from even being an option?\nAnother small issue i run into is, i use an external monitor(1920x1080) sometimes and when i unlpug the hdmi cable, my desktop on my laptop screen reverts back to 3200 resolution.\nI basically want to fool ubuntu into thinking that the highest resolution to choose from is 1920x1080. Is this possible?\nSorry for the long winded question :)\n\nA: Stripping down the resolution to 1920px might not be the best solution.\nYou can easily adapt Ubuntu to such a high resolution: Adapt Ubuntu to a high-DPI resolution screen\nThere is a new new option since Ubuntu 14.04:\nIn System Settings->Displays  Look for \"Scale for menu and title bars.\" \nI solved some more issues in my Guide for the Yoga 2 Pro\nAlso you can Adjust Firefox and Thunderbird to a High DPI touchscreen display (retina)\n", "Q: Boot Failure from DVD I burned the latest ISO version of Ubuntu to a DVD (per the instructions on the site) and when I insert the disk and begin boot, all I get is Boot failure.

Always work for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have another computer with Linux, try LiveUsb from UnetBooting app (Software Center on Ubuntu) or Brasero (pre-installed app)\n\n*When booting with LiveUSB make sure to select \"USB HDD\" to boot first.\n\n\nPS: switching HD to SSD will not cause any problem or trouble in both windows or linux distros. SSD is really like a HD to the motherboard, just with much more read/write speeds. \n\nA: Can you try burn the ISO again at a lower speed? Sometimes data can get corrupted when burning an iso. \nAlso, have you tried booting from a USB, this is very simple and the biggest benefit is that you will be able to reuse the USB drive after you are finished for whatever you like. \n", "Q: What is the proper way to use a package cache with MAAS or Juju?

(It's possible to have an interface as part of a bridge, but not have it set to being up, so no traffic will go through that \"port\").\nsudo ifconfig eth1 up\nsudo ifconfig eth2 up\nsudo ifconfig br0 up\n\nAlso, check your work on the bridge to make sure it has the interfaces you are expecting:\nsudo brctl show\n\nMake sure that you have the LAN IP address assigned on the bridge interface instead of either of the ethernet interfaces that are part of the bridge/switch:\nifconfig eth1\nifconfig eth2\n\n(Neither of them should list an IP address). If one of them does, try something like:\nsudo ip addr del 192.168.0.1/24 dev eth1\n\nMake sure your bridge interface does have it:\nifconfig br0\n\n(It should list the address). If it does not have the address, do this:\n sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev br0\n\nAnother thing I would try checking: See if any clients attached to eth2 can ping anything on eth1. If so, then the bridge and interfaces (and their up/down state) is probably set up right, and I would look at the IPtables rules. If they can't talk to each other, than it's probably not with IPtables, and probably something with the bridge or interfaces that are part of it.\n", "Q: How do I check the internet speed inside Ubuntu 14.04 How do I check the internet speed on my computer, a dell Inspiron 1545,  while using ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: indicator-netspeed works nice\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-netspeed\n\nYou can watch the internet speed in top panel and it takes less space in top panel.\n\nA: Observing the current upload and download rate is fairly easy in Ubuntu. The easiest option is to use the System Monitor, but you can do it through the console as well.\nGUI Option\nUbuntu comes with an application called System Monitor, which acts like the Windows Task Manager. To open it, search for \"System Monitor\" in your dash and start up the proper application. Select the Resources tab and you should see CPU History, Memory and Swap History, and Network History. What you want is the network history, which should show your current upload/download rates, as well as a graph of them over time.\nCommand-Line Option\nAlternatively, you may want to test your speeds. To do this, you could use SpeedTest.net or wget. The latter is a Terminal command. To use it, enter wget in the console and provide it with a download URL as an argument (i.e. wget http://download.org/download.tar.gz). You should choose a fairly large file you know to have good speeds. Once you've done that, you can observe your download speed from the console. Feel free to delete the downloaded file afterwards.

I have searched and I believe there is no a question like this one. Whenever my laptop finds updates the Software Updater application comes up as usual however it is always showing the package highlighted in the picture (both with the square and the cursor).\nI'm unable to check them, nor update them. Is there a way of updating them or delete them?\n\nA: It was solved by using synaptic and double clicking the package libapache2-svn (which had a exclamation mark in the status (S) column, meaning: \"installed and upgradeable\").\nThe package got updated - problem solved.\nI don't really know why it wouldn't update using the update manager.\n\nA: Do:sudo apt-get remove libapache2-svn apache2.2-bin, then, before confirming, check carefully that no packages are removed that you want to keep.The lines in your screenshot are taken from the Description field in the package database.

If so how can I recover my data?\n\nA: If you installed Ubuntu 14.04 with the replace Windows 8.1 option then it replaced Windows 8.1 completely which means that Ubuntu took over the partitions that used to be occupied by Windows 8.1.\nEven though the partition has been \"deleted\" the data should still be there as long as it was not overwritten by new files. \nYou may still be able to recover some of the data from the Windows 8.1 partition using some of the tools in this documentation. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery \nKeep in mind you may not be able to recover all of your files, and some of the files that you do recover may be corrupted. \n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04 - No soundcard detected HDA Intel Realtek ALC880 After fresh install of Lubuntu 14.04 no sound card is detected.

During the installation the sound level can be mutted, check out in the slider if it is not mute!\n\nA: No idea whether this will help you, but I know the frustration of running out of ideas, so if you don't get any other leads, perhaps worth a try.\nI have an Asus laptop on which I recently installed Lubuntu 14.04. I wasn't getting any sound from the laptop's main internal speakers with the default installation. \nI ended up installing pavucontrol (otherwise known as PulseAudio Volume Control) package. (PulseAudio itself was already installed.)\nWithin pavucontrol, under the Configuration tab, there were two Built-In Audio device profiles listed. The top one was \"Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output (unplugged)\". The bottom one was \"Analog Stereo Duplex\". I changed that bottom \"Analog Stereo Duplex\" to \"Analog Stereo Output\". That change gave me sound output through the laptop's internal speakers. (I had gone through a similar experience with Lubuntu 13.10.)\n\nA: \"./configure --with-cards=hda-intel\"\n\"make\"\n\"make install\"\n\n\n*\n\n*these ran without error, but when I rebooted there was still no sound.\nAfter a spot of gooogling , and more in desperation than expectation, I installed\npulseaudio and pulseaudio-utils.\n\n\nMy laptop then refused to boot! but after a lot of fiddling around taking out the battery etc it booted up and, much to my surprise, there was a speaker icon and sound.\nThanks again.  \n\nA: Lubuntu 14.04.  Ergo Z91F Dual Core laptop, alc660 soundcard.\nI followed Scott Goodgames advice and it worked for me eventually. (Thanks, Scott)\nI hope this rundown will help those who, like me, struggle with command-line stuff.\nI downloaded the driver into a folder named \"alc660\".\nFor some reason the \"tar\" instruction wouldn't work for me, but opening with\nXarchiver worked.\nThis produced a folder named \"Rt-Linux-HDaudio-5.18\".\nIn this folder was another tarball named \"alsa-driver-RTv5.18rc8.tar.bz2\" ( plus a guide\nand a Readme)\nI \"Xarchiver\"ed  this tarball and got the folder \"alsa-driver-RTv5.18\".\nWhen I tried to run \"configure\" I kept getting \"no such file or directory\".\nThis was because I was \"CD\"ing to the wrong place: the \"configure\" script is in\nanother folder (underneath \"alsa-driver-RTv5.18\" named \"alsa\")\nso I needed to CD to\n/home/geoff/alc660/Rt-Linux-HDaudio-5.18/alsa-driver-RTv5.18/alsa\n", "Q: How do I create a cloud? So I am kind of new at this,but I have my mind set on creating a cloud. By cloud I mean a place where I can store file and access them from anywhere, like Dropbox or Google Drive. I cant really find a step by step guide on what I need to do in order to create one. I have an old computer that I would like to use but  I don't know how to set everything up. If I will need more than one computer I can get that, although i would like to use only one if possible. By the way i am not looking for a software program, such as OwnCloud or others, I am looking for an operating system.\n\nA: Cloud is just a term file hosting companies use to differentiate themselves from pirating file hosts. Cloud meaning the file hosting service is typically intended as a place for the user to backup all their personal files rather than share files with others.\nYour question is a rather loaded one, but lets break it down in terms of what you'd need.\nList Of Things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A computer to host the files (aka server).\n\n*An ip address for the computer, and if desired a domain name. [So you can access the computer over the net. If you plan to use a domain name with your site eg: http://example.per.red then you'll probably want a static ip for ease though there are a few services that can help you use a dynamic ip for webhosting. If you plan to access the site over the internet keep in mind the bandwidth limits of your internet plan.]\n\n*Ubuntu with Lamp installed, or some kind of OS setup with a web server program. [Lamp will add web hosting capability to your Ubuntu installation so you can host a website. You can use the server or desktop version of Ubuntu it doesn't matter.]\n\n*A website [This part will be tricky because it needs to support browsing files, uploading files, allow the user to download files, and most importantly secure the whole thing. You'll either have to find a file hosting website script, buy one like YetiShare, or make one yourself (php html etc). If you use a site script built by someone else it may require you to have a domain name rather than just an ip.]\nYou can setup a Local cloud server for use only in your house, or you can setup one to be over the internet for use anywhere. If your plan is the internet then it would probably be cheaper to just purchase vps hosting rather than shell out for a static ip and bandwidth for it.\n", "Q: SteadyFlow extension Chrome Can steadyflow download manager run on Chrome?

I made  clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04 on 18th of April. Then to overcome the problem of heating, I installed the fglrx-updates driver for my Radeon HD 7730M graphics.\nYesterday, on boot everything looked fine until I get to the login screen. After putting in my password and logging in the login screen disappears, however my desktop never loaded and the mouse and keyboard become non-responsive. The desktop background also didn't show up. The only thing I can do at that point is force power down.\nSo, as per the answer given on this page, I tried the steps but all in vain. So, I made a live USB of Ubuntu 14.04 and reinstalled in the same partitions as before. Now, It's working fine.\nBut can somebody tell me whether switching to GNOME is better? Because, yesterday I couldn't give a seminar since my slides were stored in Ubuntu. Now if this problem keeps popping up, it's gonna create problems for me.\n\nA: Graphics integration is still dodgy. If the GPU drivers are not working in Unity, they probably won't in GNOME either. \nYou can try the following if unity fails to load:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F1 to go to tty shell.\n\n*Login and execute (for Unity)\n$ sudo service lightdm restart\nIf this works, then you might get away with your current graphics drivers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 ATI Legacy drivers compile error: /lib/modules/.../build/include/linux/version.h not found Short story, get Error!

If a \n  package is selected for installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the \n  command line) and it could not be downloaded then it will be silently held back. \n\n Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Missing.\n\nThis is confusing:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can 'ignore missing' and 'fix missing' be synonyms for the same option?\n\n*What does 'hold back' mean in this context?\n\n*What does 'handle the result' mean?\n\n\nAnd in what situation is it useful anyway? When you try to install a package not in the apt index, you get this message:\nE: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?\n\nAre the two suggestions (apt-get update, apt-get install --fix-missing...) at all equivalent?\n\nA: Ok, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*(1) -m ignore missing or fix missing packages (as opposed to -f broken packages). These options are synonyms for the same option. (Since to fix it ignores from here it takes its own weirdness  :-) )\n\n*(2-3) When you install/upgrade with apt-get upgrade or with apt-get install somepackage, usually apt tries to update dependencies. This means that it may find that some packages need new or updated versions of existing packages, and so on in a cascade of dependencies. If some of those packages are missing or fail the integrity check, it seems to  suspend this package, and wants you to go to handle the result following the handle method of the requiring package, if possible. Often it stops installing this package.\n\n*(4)  With apt-get update you download what is needed to rebuild the list of dependencies.\nAfter that you can try apt-get install --fix-missing again, in the hope that the updated list fixes the problem by itself.\nThis can be very useful at times, such as when you add a source for packages in your /etc/atp/sources.list,\nor when the package index files have been updated.\n\n\nNot all the programs you can use under Ubuntu came from the official Ubuntu repositories, and are updated with the same versions -- this is rare.\nMoreover, there are many reasons why an installation can be abruptly interrupted (A kill signal, a power shortage, a failure of graphic driver...)  In those situations, apt-get update may not work, so you first need to fix the problem with apt-get install --fix-missing or with some dpkg  commands.  \nYou can see apt-get install --fix-missing as a light and friendly version of commands like dpkg-reconfigure --all or dpkg. \n", "Q: Cannot boot from CD Drive Initially, I had Windows 8 in my Computer and I accidentally formatted my hard drive. I was not having Windows Installation Disk, and hence I installed Ubuntu 14.04. Now I have the Windows Installation Disk, but I couldn't boot from the CD/DVD (Official). When I start the computer with the CD in the tray, it directly boots to Ubuntu. I have no idea how to boot from Disk. I also have the Ubuntu Live CD, but I couldn't boot that too. All I want is Windows back.\nAlso, I would like to ask that would formatting hard drive would remove UEFI? (I'm a bit noob regarding booting!). If yes, how would I get it back?\nAlso, how do we format the whole hard drive without booting from any Disk?\n\nA: Go to your BIOS settings (when your computer starts up and shows a key to go to your BIOS settings) go to the boot order (or anything like that) and put CD/DVD Drive on top.\nI don't think so that when you format your hard drive your UEFI will be gone. I guess it stays inside your computer not your hard disk. I'm sorry if its gone. Please make sure you look on internet to make sure your UEFI disappears.\nFor formatting your hard drive with out booting, use an external hard drive case, if you don't have one, boot from your live ubuntu cd (when you boot, click try ubuntu, it won't install on your hard drive) use gparted (application) and format/delete your partitions.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Unable to install Oracle SQL Developer 4.0.2 (4.0.2.15.21) from rpm file I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 (using Update Manager), and it works fine with no issues.\nIn which I am using SQL Developer 3.2.20.09 and it works fine.

I recommend Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x64. A quick google search will help you find rufus. But here it is just to be nice (click on this orange text)\nOnce you have rufus up and running, insert your usb stick.  Remember your usb stick will lose EVERYTHING on it, so make sure you get anything important off of it first.  I think the smallest you can use is 4 GB but I recommend 8 GB just to be safe.\nSelect your Ubuntu image down in the middle right portion of the rufus window.\nTHIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART:\nAFTER selecting your image, then go back to the top of the rufus window and make sure you select GPT style with uefi.

There were some bad sectors in a partition used by both Ubuntu and Windows. I have run chkdsk (from Windows installation disk), and so Windows will not access these bad sectors anymore.\nHowever, will Ubuntu try to read/write to these sectors causing further errors?\n\nA: I think the true answer is it depends.\nHave you tried running any hardware testing software outside of windows or Ubuntu?  This will help you determine if the bad sectors are hard or soft bad sectors.\n-If they are \"soft\" bad sectors, chkdsk has already repaired them and both windows and Ubuntu will both write to those portions of the disk again.\n-If they are \"hard\" bad sectors, you must start asking yourself things like...how old is my disk? have I caused any damage to the disk (like drops or falls)? If not, then there may be something wrong with the S.M.A.R.T controller on your disk.  This piece of hardware is supposed to take care of marking bad sectors so that NO operating system running on the disk writes or reads to those areas.\n-Preferably before but you can after; you perform your hardware test outside of all operating systems using a utility like pc-check you should make a backup just in case your drive is on the verge of failure.

Then I install ubuntu 14.04 (separated partition). but i cant have the liste of availbale OS in the HDD , so the PC start Win7 ! Any solution pliz ?\n\nA: There are many possible reasons for this. For instance, if your computer is using BIOS, you have to make sure, that the disc selected as boot device in BIOS setup, and the device you installed the Ubuntu Bootloader (GRUB) to are the same. Also, when installing Ubuntu, you should make sure that the bootloader is installed to the MBR of the HDD you want to use as a boot device in BIOS, not to one of its partitions.\nIf your computer is using (U)EFI, you must be careful to install both, Windows and Ubuntu in EFI mode (preferred), or both in BIOS compatibility mode (emergency solution, if EFI does not work). If you use BIOS compatibility mode, the pervious paragraph applies. If you use EFI mode, you might have to go to the EFI setup screen after installing Ubuntu, since both, Windows and Ubuntu, will create an EFI boot entry and on some computers EFI does not automatically switch to Ubuntu. The labeling is slightly misleading, since the Ubuntu entry actually launches a bootloader that allows you to choose every time you boot your PC, if you want to boot to Ubuntu or Windows.\n\nA: This was the problem that I met days before.\nIf system directly loading into Ubuntu. \nUpdate your Grub.

I have found that uefi likes gpt disks especially if you have as many partitions as you do.  I realize that some of your disks are logical but with gpt partitioning they won't have to be.  I am just not sure windows xp supports gpt, actually I am pretty sure it doesn't.  You should be able to do anything you need for XP in a virtual machine, however.\nIt looks like everything should work in theory the way you have it set up, but a lot does depend on your bios set up.  For grub to be your primary bootloader you will either have to install it to sda (not sdaX...just sda) or the better solution is what you have most likely already done which is install grub to sdb.\nThe trick there is to set your bios to boot from the second hard disk (sdb or primary slave or secondary master in your bios) After you do that, you can chainload into the windows 8 and windows xp bootloader.\nIf you get stuck at some point but have already been able to get grub back to a working point and can get into a version of windows.  play around with a program called EasyBCD to fix your windows related problems.\nOne other negative depending on your computer manufacturer about disabling uefi mode is that sometimes you lose hardware virtualization abilities.  It also can cause you problems with graphics drivers that were poorly written for uefi systems only. Hope this helps!\n\nA: In windows turn off Fast boot first.http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6320-fast-startup-turn-off-windows-8-a.html.Then restart.\nIf it loads Ubuntu directly without grub menu,Update your Grub.\nGo to terminal then type\nsudo update-grub\n\nthen\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Can I install in unallocated partition and use BIOS to boot? I am trying to install Ubuntu on a Windows 7 64bit laptop. The installer didn't recognise Windows. The partitions, according to Windows Disk Management are 1) 100MB NTFS System, Active, Primary Partition 2) (C:) 220 GB Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition 3) 220.66 GB Unallocated 4) 25 GB Recovery Partition.\nCould I install Ubuntu in the Unallocated Partition - I think it was called Free Space in the Installer - and then just use the BIOS to boot - at the moment I want to carry on using Windows most of the time, while I learn how to use Linux.\nAndrew\nP.S. I got this boot-info report: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7409913/\n\nA: Depends if you are using UEFI mode on Windows 7...if you are, then sure  -----The main reason I have found Ubuntu to not recognize a windows partition is either because encryption software like true-crypt is installed or quick-boot mode is enabled where each time you shutdown windows it is really only hibernating.  There are thousands of posts all over AskUbuntu and google that detail how to disable all of that. Just make sure you know your laptop vendors button to select which loader you want to use in the uefi. (an \"f\") key...\n----Otherwise if you aren't using uefi, then you should be able to chainload either grub then windows boot loader or vice versa.  When you install Ubuntu just make sure you install grub to the \"unallocated partition\" you have been speaking of. If you install grub to sda (no number) you will make the windows boot loader mad and have to do lots of extra work to get everything back to normal...\n\nA: Create a new ext4 partition from that unallocated space through gparted and install Ubuntu on it by choosing  something else option in the Ubuntu installer.\nYou don't need to run boot-repair before installing Ubuntu. It have to be runned after installing Ubuntu on a Windows pc only if the options for both Os's are not appears in the grub menu.\n\nA: just for clarification:\nno, you can't install Ubuntu to a partition to select booting it from the BIOS.\nThis is mainly because to boot your computer needs a master boot record (MBR) on your hard disk (which is not the same than a partition). At present this is the Windows boot loader. On installing Ubuntu this boot loader has to be replaced by Grub. Different to the Windows boot loader Grub is able to boot both, Ubuntu and Windows. The Windows boot loader refuses to boot Ubuntu.\nIt is possible to use a boot loader other than Grub and direct it (\"chainload\") to Grub located on a paritition boot record but this is a special case and probably not what you want.\nTo be able to recognize a Windows partition on installing Ubuntu you need to take care of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*do not use Windows \"dynamic\" disk format.\n\n*do not hibernate Windows.\n\n*disable \"fast boot\" option from Windows.\n\n*do not have your Windows boot partition encrypted.\n\n*do not install Ubuntu when its installer does not see your Windows. All your data will be deleted then. If in doubt better ask somebody (e.g. here in chat) before you proceed.\n\n\nIn case you want to select the booting hard drive (not the partition!) from BIOS you will need another, separate hard disk.\n", "Q: Error in Juju configurations I have configured Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 1 vm for MAAS-cluster, 2 VM for Nodes to connect the MAAS-cluster.\nI am not able to complete juju configuration in nodes, find the below error.\nError details:\ncannot parse \"/root/.juju/environments.yaml\": YAML error: line 326: could not find expected ':'\n\nWhat should i do to solve this problem ?\n\nA: It seems like your environments.yaml file can't be read because it doesn't comply with the YAML syntax.

My /etc/crypttab ended up like: \ncryptswap1 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x500...-part6 /dev/urandom swap, cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\n\nA: Just use an unencrypted swap\n... and keep /home encrypted\nI tried a couple of the other solutions suggested here.\nEven though they kept working after a hot reboot, eventually they all failed after a shutdown and cold restart.\nThis tells us we are actually dealing with a double bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*The UUID of the swap drive gets overridden by the encryption system, and\n\n*There is a timeout issue during booting.\n\n\nThese thoughts are also reflected in the comments to the pertaining bug filed at Launchpad.\nHowever, with the pending move from Upstart to systemd, little is done to resolve the bug on current LTS systems.\nAt this point, the following thoughts crossed my mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*During system installation, I asked to only encrypt my \\home partition, nothing else.\n\n*The risks involved with not having an encrypted swap partition are rather limited.\n\n*It is up to Canonical to clean up their act. I will waste no more time with this.\n\n\nSo, here is my solution to restore the swap as a normal, unencrypted swap without having to reinstall the whole operating system.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have not done so already, install blkid: $ sudo apt-get install blkid\n\n*Edit /etc/crypttab and delete the whole cryptswap1 line: $ sudo nano /etc/crypttab\n\n*Start GParted from the system Settings menu.\n\n*You will see a partition with an exclamation mark. This should be the faulty swap partition.\nCarefully select it and reformat it to a linux-swap partition.\nAfter having applied this operation, you are informed about the new UUID of the restored normal swap partition. You are offered an opportunity to save this information. If you do not, know that you can always retrieve the new UUID from the command line with blkid: $ sudo blkid\n\n*Now, it is time to restore /etc/fstab to its old glory: $ sudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the entire line containing a reference to /dev/mapper/cryptswap1.\n\n*Uncomment the old swap line by removing the hash # in front of UUID=....\n\n*Now, replace the old UUID with the new one obtained earlier.\n\n*Write the file out by hitting Ctrl+O  and exit nano with Ctrl+X.\n\n\n*Once done all that, you can already start using the new unencrypted swap with: $ sudo swapon -a\n\n*This solution survives both hot reboots and shutdown with cold restart.\n\n\nA: Have a look at this. I fixed this issue by simply replacing UUID=... with /dev/sda3 in /etc/crypttab.\n\nA: Known Bug\nThere is a bug (see below) that overwrites the UUID for the partition as soon as data is written to it. Therefore, you cannot use the UUID to reference the partition to use for encrypted swap.\nThese days, swap space is hardly ever used. On my machine, swap is only used when I open my 40th tab. When I have no swap, suddenly my computer starts lagging and the browser closes itself. Or in the case of the Chromium browser, a lot of tabs will suddenly 'die'.\nFor this reason, referencing /dev/disk/by-uuid/ in your /etc/crypttab might seem to be working for a while, but as soon as your swap space is actually used, it will overwrite the UUID because the entire partition is used for encrypted data storage.\nEasy Fix\nThe easy fix is to reference the swap partition by device in your /etc/crypttab, e.g.: \ncryptswap1 /dev/sda5 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nWarning: this is probably safe on a laptop (I use it like this), but if you are on a desktop with swappable drives or have other reasons for changing the drive/partition layout, you don't want to do this, as a normal storage partition might suddenly be used for swap.\nNote: You need to reboot for this change to take effect, because only when booting will /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 be created.\nProper Fix\nThe proper way to fix this is to make sure the part of the raw partition that stores the UUID is not overwritten by encrypted swap data, so it will still be there on reboot. However, I'm not sure where the UUID is written and how much bytes it takes up. You could, at your own risk, test it like so:\ncryptswap1 UUID=abe3c568-c8fd-4dfb-b8e9-0520d442dd61 /dev/urandom swap,offset=36,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nNote the offset=36.\nPlease if you have an Ubuntu One account log in and go to Bug #1310058 on Launchpad and choose (or click here): \"This bug affects me too\" so the bug will gain 'popularity' and is more prone to get fixed.\n\nUpdate 2014-10-27\nI also stumbled upon this. Not verified by me. It looks like offset trick with more verbosity and comments about rebuilding a broken swap.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecryptfs-utils/+bug/1310058/comments/22\n\nA: I have this problem, as did the people in question 332625.  Some combination of suspend and reboot loses the UUID of your swap partition (as the comment in your /etc/fstab says, confirm this with sudo blkd), so the line in your /etc/crypttab to use that UUID as encrypted swap fails.\nI'm having no luck switching /etc/crypttab to use the partition's /dev name (/dev/sda6 in your case) or dev/disk/by-id/ name instead of the vanishing UUID.\nAbandoning encrypted swap is the easiest and so far best solution, sadly.\n", "Q: Problem when upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 from Ubuntu 12.04 When upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 from Ubuntu 12.04 I am getting the following error:\n\nW:Failed to fetch http://deb.opera.com/opera-beta/dists/stable/Release\n  Unable to find expected entry 'non-free/source/Sources' in Release\n  file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file) , E:Some index files\n  failed to download.

As I explain in more details HERE, the real problem is that the path to the official Opera repositories have changed but the Opera DEB installation packages weren't reconfigured to reflect this change.\nThe change in repo location affects those who already were Opera users. And the lack of reconfiguration of the DEB installation packages affects new Opera users.\nIn order to fix this issue, all you have to do is to execute these commands at the shell terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using Opera stable:\nsudo sed -i -e 's,opera-stable/ stable,opera-stable/opera/ stable,' \"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera-stable.list\" ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get check\n\n\n*If you're using Opera Beta stable:\nsudo sed -i -e 's,opera-beta/ stable,opera-beta/opera/ stable,' \"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera-beta.list\" ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get check\n\n", "Q: How to search in another language than the system language? My Ubuntu system is installed with the Italian language so, when I search with the Dash, I obtain the results from the Italian version of Wikipedia. But let's say I need more information on my topic, and I know that the English version of Wikipedia is more comprehensive.\nHow can I obtain from the Dash the results from the English Wikipedia instead of the Italian one?\n\nA: In the Terminal, type:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/libtranslate/services.xml\n\nList item\nIn the file, make this line of code bold in  the google section of the gedit file. \n<language to=\"it\" tag=\"en\"/> `\n\nWhen I looked in gedit, the language you want to change looks like this \"*\", so you still need to change that part to \"it\", but the rest is done for you. \nAfter this, restart language translator from the dash. After you have done this, resart gnome-translate. Next, try it out with this code: echo\"Hope this helps. Good luck.\" | translate-bin -s google -f it -t en.\n\nA: I am unsure how deep you want to delve into this, but I'll give it a shot at an answer.\nIt seems a quick and dirty way to change the search would be change the messages locale temporarily.\nFrom terminal (before using lens, and while it is up):\nLC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\nClose the terminal and it should go back to your default.\nOr before the application(if you want to run the lens from command line I guess). \nI have looked at the source code for the '__ init __.py' for the actual lens (it was written in python) there are two lines, which check your locale messages, they get it from the system, but I am unsure what you would need to change to get it to be set to multi languages.It is grabbing the locale to determine which wikipedia (en,fr,de,it, etc.) to search.\nMore stuff below, which may be helpful\n(from the '__ init __.py' in the lens package)\n\nlocale.setlocale(locale.LC_MESSAGES, '')\n loc = locale.getlocale(locale.LC_MESSAGES)[0].split(\"_\")[0]\n(line 28 and 29)\n\nwiki= http://%s.wikipedia.org  % (loc)\n(line 31)\n\n(Explanation of code: the locale is being checked from LC_MESSAGES on system, it is being put into a variable called (loc), which is then split to grab the first portion of the language code (something like 'en_US.UTF-8') for English the result would be 'en', French 'fr', etc. It then takes this variable, and puts it into the %s in the wiki variable before the .wikipedia.org)\nIt seems like the developer of the lens was probably the person who wrote this entry in the developer section. (the code looks the same)\nIf you wanted to hard code a language in, it looks like you could do that as well.\nYou could make a custom lens for Wikipedia and change the locale (or have multiple locales if you wanted to program it in somehow)\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/2012/04/how-to-create-a-wikipedia-unity-lens-for-ubuntu/\nYou will then need to restart for these changes to take effect.\n\nA: Just an idea: add Wikipedia (en) in firefox's list of search engines: go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page then click the small arrow in the search engines drop list and choose Add \"Wikipedia (en)\".\nSorry this answer may only expand searches to Wikipedia (en) only, not to all English sources. If it works you could add the same way any other localized search engine you'd like.  \nFurther more I believe you need to have the ubuntu firefox plugin(s) installed and activated.

About the DVD:\n\n\n*\n\n*DVD+R is printed on the disk, as well as - separately (!) - RW\n\nI burned the 14.04 LTS *.iso on to that DVD in Win7, following standard procedure as listed on ubuntu.com \nShould this DVD still be re-usable to burn other things on it? If so, how much of the original 4.7GB space should still be available for re-use?\n\nA: If what you mean for the \"separately\" \"RW\" is something like this: \n\nThat means, literally, \"The read-write characteristics of this disk are: DVD+R\". Don't let the logo (the stylized RW) confound you. \nSo in this case you have a write-once media; you can't erase data.   \nThe writable-once disks come in two flavors, DVD+R and DVD-R. Only the first ones allows you to add data if the disk is not full (multi-session). \nSo if you have a DVD+R disk, the general answer is \"no, you can't\" if you have closed the disk, or \"yes, you can\" use the rest of the capacity if you have not closed it by opening another session. \nIn this case, the answer is probably no, you can't because I think that the programs that write a bootable DVD also close the disk.\nA real rewritable disc will have: \n\n\nA: Your \"DVD+R\" \"RW\" may be a DVD+RW, which is reusable:\n\nThe recording layer in DVD+RW and DVD-RW discs is a phase change metal\n  alloy (often GeSbTe) whose crystalline phase and amorphous phase have\n  different reflectivity. The states can be switched depending on the\n  power of the writing laser, so data can be written, read, erased and\n  re-written.\n\nOfficially speaking, there is no such thing as \"DVD+R\" \"RW\"; it sounds like one of the various shorthand terms, like DVD±R/±RW, that are commonly used to describe the different formats of disks. \nThe easiest way to test this is to try writing a new image to the disk.\n\nA: \nUnlike DVD+RW discs, DVD+R discs can only be written to once. (...) This can cause confusion because the DVD+RW Alliance logo is a stylized 'RW'. Thus, a DVD+R disc may have the RW logo, but it is not rewritable.\n\nTherefore the answer seems to be no: non-reusable (as in, non-rewritable), as has also been discussed in a previous SX Q&A.\n", "Q: Toshiba Tecra A8 without audio with Ubuntu 14.04 Bug alsa Sound used to work but now it doesn't.\nuname -a\nLinux PCIFP26 3.13.0-24-generic #47-Ubuntu SMP \nFri May 2 23:31:42 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n\naplay -l\n**** Lista de PLAYBACK dispositivos hardware ****\ntarjeta 0: Intel [HDA Intel], dispositivo 0: ALC262 Analog [ALC262 Analog]\n  Subdispositivos: 0/1\n  Subdispositivo #0: subdevice #0\ntarjeta 0: Intel [HDA Intel], dispositivo 6: Si3054 Modem [Si3054 Modem]\n  Subdispositivos: 1/1\n  Subdispositivo #0: subdevice #0\n\nhead -n 1 /proc/asound/card*/codec#*\n==> /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 <==\nCodec: Realtek ALC262\n\n==> /proc/asound/card0/codec#1 <==\nCodec: LSI Si3054\n\nalsa-base.conf file\n# autoloader aliases\ninstall sound-slot-0 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-0\ninstall sound-slot-1 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-1\ninstall sound-slot-2 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-2\ninstall sound-slot-3 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-3\ninstall sound-slot-4 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-4\ninstall sound-slot-5 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-5\ninstall sound-slot-6 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-6\ninstall sound-slot-7 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-7\n\n# Cause optional modules to be loaded above generic modules\ninstall snd /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd $CMDLINE_OPTS\n && { /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-ioctl32 ; /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-seq ; }\n#\n# Workaround at bug #499695 (reverted in Ubuntu see LP #319505)\ninstall snd-pcm /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-pcm $CMDLINE_OPTS\n && { /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-pcm-oss ; : ; }\ninstall snd-mixer /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-mixer $CMDLINE_OPTS\n && { /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-mixer-oss ; : ; }\ninstall snd-seq /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-seq $CMDLINE_OPTS\n && { /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-seq-midi ; /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-seq-oss ; : ; }\n#\ninstall snd-rawmidi /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-rawmidi $CMDLINE_OPTS\n && { /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-seq-midi ; : ; }\n# Cause optional modules to be loaded above sound card driver modules\ninstall snd-emu10k1 /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-emu10k1 $CMDLINE_OPTS\n && { /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-emu10k1-synth ; }\ninstall snd-via82xx /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-via82xx $CMDLINE_OPTS\n && { /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist snd-seq ; }\n\n# Load saa7134-alsa instead of saa7134 (which gets dragged in by it anyway)\ninstall saa7134 /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install saa7134 $CMDLINE_OPTS\n && { /sbin/modprobe --quiet --use-blacklist saa7134-alsa ; : ; }\n# Prevent abnormal drivers from grabbing index 0\noptions bt87x index=-2\noptions cx88_alsa index=-2\noptions saa7134-alsa index=-2\noptions snd-atiixp-modem index=-2\noptions snd-intel8x0m index=-2\noptions snd-via82xx-modem index=-2\noptions snd-usb-audio index=-2\noptions snd-usb-caiaq index=-2\noptions snd-usb-ua101 index=-2\noptions snd-usb-us122l index=-2\noptions snd-usb-usx2y index=-2\n# Ubuntu #62691, enable MPU for snd-cmipci\noptions snd-cmipci mpu_port=0x330 fm_port=0x388\n# Keep snd-pcsp from being loaded as first soundcard\noptions snd-pcsp index=-2\n# Keep snd-usb-audio from beeing loaded as first soundcard\noptions snd-usb-audio index=-2\n\nAny ideas, of what it can be.\n\nA: SoundTroubleshootingProcedure\nStep 9\nIf you are using a dual boot system (even with Windows and Ubuntu installed on separate partitions), then make sure to set the sound volume in Windows to a high level before booting into Ubuntu.

My Ubuntu 14.04 has Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. For Python 2 I could install cx_Freeze very conveniently using:\nsudo apt install cx-freeze\n\nHowever this only installs cx-freeze for Python 2 not for Python 3. Also the officialy cx_Freeze website does not contain installation hints. I'm not very firm in building software from scratch.

I tried listing permissions with ls -la and I'm a little confused by the output:\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 kat  kat  4096 mei  8 14:20 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 mei  8 14:20 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 kat  kat  4096 mei  8 14:20 FastQC_v0.10.1\n\nAs I understand it, that means I'm the owner of the current directory and the subdirectory FastQC_v0.10.1, and I should have all the permissions.  Root is the owner of the parent directory, which would be /usr/local/bin.  Am I reading this output correctly?  Why would the script be crashing due to insufficient permissions?\n\nA: I got the same error. I end up putting FastQC to /usr/share, as many other packages are put there, and put a link to /usr/local/bin, as suggested by the installation guide. Then I changed the permissions to files under FastQC.\nsudo ln -s /path/to/FastQC/fastqc /usr/local/bin/fastqc\nsudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/FastQC\n\n\nA: I think /usr/local/bin/FastQC is a symlinked directory and since you said you already own it, then probably you may have to add the execute permission to the original location where the fastqc program is. Also note at what step the script crashes - is the script trying to create any files/directories at places you don't have permission to, etc..\n\nA: sudo chmod -R +rwx /usr/local/bin/FastQC\n\nShould have set the read / write / execute flag to /usr/local/bin/FastQC and to its content for the owner, for the group and for the others, but from your ls -la output the group and the others are missing the write flag:\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 kat  kat  4096 mei  8 14:20 .\n[...]\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 kat  kat  4096 mei  8 14:20 FastQC_v0.10.1\n\nAltough this might not be a problem, it looks like chmod somehow failed.\nThe first thing I'd try would be to run chmod -R +rwx /usr/local/bin/FastQC again and check whether /usr/local/bin/FastQC and its inner folders / files (which might don't have the read / write / execute flags set for the owner already) are actually set to be read / written / executed by the owner.\n", "Q: Booting sequence in dual boot environment - Windows 7 + Ubuntu 12.04 Until recently, I was able to progress without a problem in a single hard drive Windows 7 / Ubuntu 12.04 dual boot environment. The boot menu would prompt whether one wanted to load Windows 7 or Ubuntu 12.04, with the default being Windows 7 ; this was possible by manipulating the boot menu using EasyBCD's tool. If one were to select the Ubuntu 12.04 option, it would take one to GRUB from where Ubuntu 12.04 was loaded.\nWhile fidgeting with something, I had to update GRUB with 'update-grub' command and now the booting sequence is reversed. On booting the computer, I now get the GRUB screen (with the default being Ubuntu 12.04) and if on selecting the Windows 7 option there manually, I get the original boot menu of either Windows 7 or Ubuntu 12.04.

That should resolve it.  \nYou can mount the Windows partition and view files so your Windows installation may be still intact.  It's just that since there is no valid MBR entry for Windows, os-prober / grub is ignoring it.  \n\nA: Did yo check your grub config files to see if Windows is listed?

I've done a couple of installs of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on some old computers from a LiveCD a coworker gave me. I'm now interested in upgrading my network, including a Gateway LT4010u netbook with Intel Atom N2600 processor and 4GB of RAM, and 320GB Hard drive. I would like to install Lubuntu 14.04 LTS on this machine. My question is:\nIs it possible to install the 64-bit Intel/AMD64 version, or is the Atom REALLY a 32-bit processor?\nI intend to make a bootable USB stick for the install.\nThanks in advance for any help you can give. \nP.S. No hurry. Ubuntu 12.04 LTS works just fine for now. I wonder why it only sees 2.91 GB of the 4 GB memory stick, though....\n\nA: To check what processor architecture you have you can use the following command:\nuname -p\n\nYou should be able to install the 64-bit version of Lubuntu if your processor is x86_64 or 64-bit.\nThe reason for why the USB stick is only shown as 2.91GB can be for multiple reasons but it's probably related to formatting, that if it is in face 4GB.\n\nA: \nAll Atom processors implement the x86 (IA-32) instruction set; however, support for the Intel 64 instruction set was not added until the desktop Diamondville and desktop and mobile Pineview cores. - Wikipedia\n\nIf the notebook was produced before 2008 maybe its really 32bit (x86).\nBUT if you want to make sure that your processor is 64bit or really 32bit, you can just burn 2 ISO versions of Lubuntu/Ubuntu.\nWhen you boot from LiveCD with the wrong version for the system architecture, will display a simple message saying that you need, for example, i634 software\nI saw this message when i try to boot 64bit Ubuntu LiveCD with an old Celeron (2004) Notebook.

Any help identifying what my issue is would be greatly appreciated.\nHere is the backup script:\necho Starting backup to tape at `date`\nmt -f /dev/st0 rewind\ntar cfv /dev/st0 /srv\nmt -f /dev/st0 eject\necho Backup to tape complete at `date`\nexit\n\nHere is the restore script:\necho -n Starting restore from tape at `date` to directory: `pwd`\nmt -f /dev/st0 rewind\ntar -xfv /dev/st0\necho Restore from backup complete at `date`\nexit\n\n\nA: The options  of the tar command is wrong in the restore script. This works:\ntar xfv /dev/st0\n\nThe  only difference is the missing minus, however that is quite important. If you use the '-' then you are using the usual GNU options syntax. In that case the 'f' option must be followed by the file name. In your script 'f' is followed by a single 'v' letter. So tar tried to extract from the file named 'v'. Which does not exist as the error message correctly says.\nIf the first argument does not start with the '-', than you are using the old, but quite comfortable tar syntax. In this case the required arguments of the options follow the entire set of the options. Now 'v' means verbose, as expected, and the source file is the tape drive (/dev/st0), as expected.\nFrom the GNU tar documentation at http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#SEC36:\n\nAs far as we know, all tar programs, GNU and non-GNU, support old\n  options: that is, if the first argument does not start with '-', it is\n  assumed to specify option letters. GNU tar supports old options not\n  only for historical reasons, but also because many people are used to\n  them. If the first argument does not start with a dash, you are\n  announcing the old option style instead of the short option style; old\n  options are decoded differently.\nLike short options, old options are single letters. However, old\n  options must be written together as a single clumped set, without\n  spaces separating them or dashes preceding them. This set of letters\n  must be the first to appear on the command line, after the tar program\n  name and some white space; old options cannot appear anywhere else.\n  The letter of an old option is exactly the same letter as the\n  corresponding short option. For example, the old option 't' is the\n  same as the short option '-t', and consequently, the same as the long\n  option '--list'. So for example, the command 'tar cv' specifies the\n  option '-v' in addition to the operation '-c'.\nWhen options that need arguments are given together with the command,\n  all the associated arguments follow, in the same order as the options.\n  Thus, the example given previously could also be written in the old\n  style as follows:\n$ tar cvbf 20 /dev/rmt0\nHere, '20' is the argument of '-b' and '/dev/rmt0' is the argument of\n  '-f'.\n\n", "Q: Lubuntu Graphical Bugs I've Been Installed Lubuntu in Desktop and after \"upgrade\" some graphical/theme bugs appeared. example screenshot:\n\n\nA: There is a similar bug reported in Firefox Bug Tracker.

Save ls for when you want human eyes to see the files, and use the shell filename patterns when you want your script to do something with filenames.\n\nA: This is a problem Internal Field Separator. Rather, it's not a problem, it was designed that way. It splits up the input by whitespace, just as in positional parameters.\nFrom the Bash man page:\n\nfor name [ [ in [ word ... ] ] ; ] do list ; done\n\nThe list of words following in is expanded, generating a list of items.  The variable name is set to each element of this list in turn, and list is executed each time.   If  the  in word  is\n                  omitted,  the for command executes list once for each positional parameter that is set.  The return status is the exit status of the last command that executes.  If the\n                  expansion of the items following in results in an empty list, no commands are executed, and the return status is 0.\n\n\nThis means, that it expands the results of the expression into a list of words. This is where the Internal Field Separator, $IFS comes in. By default, $IFS is set to whitespace (space, tab, and newline). This means that a field consists of everything up to (but not including) these whitespace characters. Because the filenames consist of spaces, it is treating them as several different fields and running the loop once for each field. The way to fix this is to adjust $IFS value.\nSo, you need to adjust the $IFS to something other than whitespace. Using your current method however there would be no way to tell where one file name ends and the other begins unless they all happen to have file extensions. An easier way to go about this would be using the find utility like so:\n#Save the original IFS\noldifs=$IFS\n#Set the new IFS to the ASCII null character \\x00\nIFS=$(echo -ne \"\\x00\")\n\nfiles=\"\" #To prevent scoping issues\n\n#Use the find utility to find and print just regular files (not directories),\n#and not going further than ~/Downloads (remove '-maxlength 1' to make the\n#search fully recursive), then print the filenames in the format\n#file1\\x00file2\\x00file3\\x00file4...\n\n#However, since our new IFS is now \\x00, the boundary upon which these filenames are\n#separated now works as expected\nfor f in $(find ~/Downloads -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0)\ndo\n  files=\"$files,$f\"\ndone\necho \"$files\"\n\n#Reset IFS\nIFS=$oldifs\n\nI would also like to point out that your statement ls ~/Downloads | grep -v ^d probably doesn't do what you expect. It sounds like you were trying to filter directories out, but what is actually happening here is that it's filtering out files that start with 'd'. This is because you're not using the long form of ls like ls -l. ls -l prints output like:\ndrwxrwxrw- user group SomeDirectory size date_modified filename\n\nwheras 'ls' prints just the files names:\nSomeDirectory\nfile1\nfile2\nfile3\n\n\nA: Use while read instead of for\nThe safest way I've found for iterating over filename lists is to pipe to while read thusly:\nfind ~/Downloads -type f | while read filename; do\n  echo \"found file called $filename\";\ndone\n\nAs you can see, it puts the whole filename (separating by lines instead of whitespace) into the variable name you supply, here $filename.\nFrom the original question, however, if what is actually wanted is a comma-separated list of files, then you don't even need to iterate, just use tr to translate line separators into commas: \nfind ~/Downloads -type f | tr '\\n' ','\n\n", "Q: How to recover data from overwritten NTFS partition? I downloaded Ubuntu 14.04 and installed it via a bootable USB drive.\nI wanted dual-boot for Windows and Linux.\nI already had installed Windows 8 in C: partition.\nNow I installed Ubuntu in D: partition (with F: partition as swap area)\nI'm unable to access D: and F: drives from Windows.\nWhat do I do now?\nI have my very important files in F: drive.\nHow to recover or access it?\nPlease help me. Thanks :)\n\nA: It appears that you did not repartition the drive, but chose an existing Windows partition as swap space in the Ubuntu installer. This means your NTFS partition will be corrupted (mkswap was run on it). mkswap does not do a full format, so you should be able to recover the majority (perhaps all) of your files.\nBoot Windows and run Microsoft Checkdisk (chkdsk) on your F: drive. You might need to change the partition type from 82 (Linux swap) to 07 (HPFS/NTFS/exFAT) if it does not recognise the drive as being a Windows drive. \nIf that does not work, try TestDisk\n\nThe MFT (Master File Table) is sometimes corrupted. If Microsoft's\n  Checkdisk (chkdsk) failed to repair the MFT, run TestDisk. In the\n  Advanced menu, select your NTFS partition, choose Boot, then Repair\n  MFT. TestDisk will compare the MFT and MFT mirror (its backup). If the\n  MFT is damaged, it will try to repair the MFT using the backup. If the\n  MFT backup is damaged, it will use the main MFT.\nIf both MFT and MFTMirr are damaged and thus cannot be repaired using\n  TestDisk, you might want to try commercial software like Zero\n  Assumption Recovery, GetDataBack for NTFS or Restorer 2000.\n\n\nA: Did you install Ubuntu in UEFI mode or Legacy BIOS mode? If you have installed Ubuntu through legacy mode, then you won't be able to access Ubuntu when UEFI is enabled and vice versa.\nAlso, if you assigned your F: partition, i.e /dev/sdxy as your swap area, Ubuntu has to format that partition for using it as swap. You won't be able to get back your data (unless you did backup it or perform a data recovery).\nMake sure GRUB is properly installed and configured.\n", "Q: take changes in file sshd_config file without server reboot I changed the configuration in:\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nbut the changes were only applied after rebooting the server.\nHow to apply changes without a reboot?\n\nA: Simply restart the sshd service:\nsudo service sshd restart\n\nor:\nsudo /etc/init.d/sshd restart\n\nJust in case you are restarting remotely, the configuration should be checked first to make sure it will not fail to start:\nsudo sshd -t\n\n\nA: sudo service ssh restart\n\nwill not do it.

Then \nservice ssh restart\n\n\nA: Reload may be a better alternative to restart\nsudo service sshd reload\n\nunder the hood it sends HUP signal to sshd daemon process almost the same way Steven K already answered. The difference is that this variant uses killproc function instead of kill command directly in order to send the signal in even more precise way (to reduce possible errors of sending signals to wrong processes).\nThe configuration is reread without restarting/stopping the service.\nOf course it worth to find out how exactly SSH deamon is called actually as others discussed.\n\nA: There's an even less intrusive way to do this, without restarting the SSH service. \nFrom man sshd:\n\nsshd rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal, SIGHUP, by executing itself with the name and options it was started with, e.g. /usr/sbin/sshd.\n\nSo you can use a command like the following to send SIGHUP to the SSH server process:\nsudo kill -SIGHUP $(pgrep -f \"sshd -D\")\n\nThe pgrep -f \"sshd -D\" part will return only the PID of the sshd daemon process that listens for new connections, since there are likely to be other PIDs for each active session that don't need the signal. \n\nA: For Systemd Systems (Ubuntu default)\nsudo systemctl reload sshd.service\n\nor\n sudo systemctl reload sshd\n\nor\n sudo /bin/systemctl reload sshd.service\n\nFor Sysvinit / Systemd (Linux from Scratch default and Unix systems)\nsudo service sshd reload\n\nor\nsudo /etc/init.d/sshd reload\n\nUbuntu uses systemd: Here  the service command passes the units: start, stop, status, and reload  through to their systemctl/initctl equivalents.\n", "Q: Has anyone been able to get the Citrix Receiver running on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit?

Architecture dependant.\n\n*Burn the ISO from 1, using a burning tool or create a bootable usb drive (http://gparted.org/liveusb.php)\n\n*Boot the CD or USB drive\n\n*Delete the Entire Disk Partition.\n\n*Create A Windows Partition, of desired size, type NTFS, and Label it windows (be sure that it is primary partition because the windows boot-loader need this).\n\n*Create an ext4 partition of at least 100MB for /boot, and label it boot.\n\n*Subtract your RAM from the amount left.\n\n*Create an ext4 partition of size (Total Size - Amount in step 8), label it root.\n\n*Create a Swap Partition, size should be at least size of your pc memory (RAM).\n\n\nAfter Partitioning the Disk, reinstall Windows, using the NTFS Partition created in Step 7, making sure to use the option to preserve the existing disk format.\nAfter the Windows Install completes, reboot the computer with a Ubuntu ISO, click install, and choose something Else.  Make sure to follow your labeling scheme, i.e. mount / on the partition labeled root, mount /boot on the partition labeled boot, mount windows on the mountpoint named /windows and mount swap.  Make sure not to format the partitions\nSave the custom layout, and continue the installer.  When asked to install GRUB install it in the partition mounted as /boot.  The installer will detect the Windows Install using os-prober, and add it to your GRUB Menu.\nLastly, Do not use WUBI\n", "Q: How can I get the source code of the sound drivers in ubuntu? I have dual boot windows and ubuntu. Ubuntu can correctly detect and play my ESS 1969 sound card. So, I was thinking of the source code of ubuntu driver so that I can compile and run it on my windows 7 for sound?\n\nA: The source code for the driver is freely available from several places, including in the Ubuntu archive itself.\nHowever, you cannot simply take that source code and compile it on Windows, expecting to have a driver for your Windows platform. The open source driver in the Linux kernel is a driver for Linux only, and not for other operating systems.\nYou will need to get the driver for your sound card for Windows 7, from the manufacturer of your sound card.\n", "Q: Problem with resolv.conf I made these changes to resolv.conf today and when i restarted my laptop i cannot connect to the internet.

This is a positive sign because it means that Ubuntu is detecting the presence of your soundcard, but the drivers are not installed/running. Leave your shell running since you will need it.\nError : \n\n\n*\n\n*If it is not listed, then there are a few things that you can do.\nIf your soundcard is an onboard sound card, then it might be disabled in the system's BIOS. You will have to reboot and hit the key that lets you enter into the BIOS (usually Delete, F2, or F8).\n\n*If your soundcard is not onboard, make sure that it is properly\nseated in the PCI slot. If your card is working under Windows then\nthis is not a problem.\n\n\n3) Check to see if the ALSA driver for your sound card exists. Go to http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/ and search for your sound card (chipset) manufacturer in the dropdown box. You'll be given a matrix of the sound cards made by the manufacturer. Try to match the chipset you found in step 2 with the driver(green hyperlink text).\nSuccess - You will have found the driver for your soundcard's chipset.\nFailure - You will have not found the driver for your soundcard chipset. (at the moment I cannot help you, but stay tuned!)\n4) Now go to the terminal and type that sudo modprobe snd-\nNow, press the TAB key BEFORE pressing the ENTER key to see a list of modules.

I like dc3dd for this better than dd as dc3dd provides a progress report while it runs.\nEDIT: newer versions of dd now include a progress report with the switch status=progress. To see if yours does see man dd\n1) Boot from a Live media USB or DVD - Choose Try Ubuntu\n2) Open a terminal with CTRL - ALT - T at the prompt enter \nwhich dc3dd\nthis is just a quick way to see if you have the right tool installed for the forensic image. If it responds with a path like\n/usr/bin/dc3dd \nwe have it. If not, we have to install it and enter\nsudo apt-get install dc3dd before continuing to step 3\n3) determine what your source (old) drive is named This is likely /dev/sda but to be sure look with Disks from the GUI in the attached image below you can see my sda1 is a 128GB drive with 2 64GB partitions.\n\n4) attach the new drive Verify the device names with Disks from the GUI make notes! The old disk will be called source and the new one called target. So in this example source=/dev/sda and target will be /dev/sdb or whatever it says it is in Disks\nNow that we have a plan we will duplicate the source to the target using dc3dd.\n5) At the terminal issue the command\ndc3dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY change X to match the source (likely a) and Y to match the target (likely b or c) check your notes and be sure you have this right!!!\nNote: To create an image rather than clone a physical drive change of=/dev/sdY to of=diskimage.dd\nWhile we are copying the source drive to the target to insure we can always go back in case something goes wrong and we will be no worse off than before, we should likely familiarize ourselves with partitions in general. A good write up can be found at http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/270354-32-understnading-extended-logical-primary-partitions This knowledge will be useful later in the process. \n6) When the copy is complete shut down, disconnect the drive marked source (old drive) and put it away somewhere safe.\n7) Boot up the machine again with the Live DVD/USB with the target (new drive) attached.\n8)We're going to install testdisk to recover the partitions on the target drive which is now identical to the source in terms of data.\nOpen a terminal and issue the command\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n9) When the installation is complete we issue the command testdisk\nThe following example steps are from a very good step by step tutorial source\nOne condition:\n\n    TestDisk must be executed with Administrator privileges.\n\nImportant points for using TestDisk:\n\n    To navigate in TestDisk, use the Arrow and PageUp/PageDown keys.\n    To proceed, confirm your choice(s) with the Enter key.\n    To return to a previous display or quit TestDisk, use the q (Quit) key.\n    To save modifications under TestDisk, you must confirm them with the y (Yes) and/or Enter keys, and\n    To actually write partition data to the MBR, you must choose the \"Write\" selection and press the Enter key.\n\nLog creation\n\nChoose Create to instruct Testdisk to create a log file containing technical information and messages, unless you have a reason to append data to the log or you execute TestDisk from read only media and must create the log elsewhere.\nChoose None if you do not want messages and details of the process to be written into a log file (useful if for example Testdisk was started from a read-only location).\nPress Enter to proceed.\n\n\nAll hard drives should be detected and listed with the correct size by TestDisk:\ndisk selection\nUse up/down arrow keys to select your hard drive with the lost partition/s.\nPress Enter to Proceed.\n\n\nTestDisk displays the partition table types.\nmenu partition table type\nSelect the partition table type - usually the default value is the correct one as TestDisk auto-detects the partition table type.\nPress Enter to Proceed.\n\nCurrent partition table status\nTestDisk displays the menus (also see TestDisk Menu Items).\n\nUse the default menu \"Analyse\" to check your current partition structure and search for lost partitions.\nConfirm at Analyse with Enter to proceed.\n\nNow, your current partition structure is listed.

Replace the lsdvd package with the highest numbered version of the amd64 package at: http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/l/lsdvd/. As of March 2015, this was \"lsdvd_0.17-1_amd64.deb\".\n\nA: uninstall lsdvd 0.16 4 and install lsdvd 0.16 3 in http://packages.ubuntu.com/ (saucy)\n", "Q: How to schedule a command to run a few seconds after startup? I was trying to use @reboot /my/script in cron to run a script on a 10.04.4 VM running in VMware Fusion top print ifconfig to a file on a shared directory, which is /mnt/hgfs/somedir.\nIt didn't work because hgfs is not mounted yet as a remote directory when the system starts.  Is it possible to do something like @reboot +10s to run the cron job 10 sec after the system starts, when I can realistically expect to have that remote directory mounted on the system?\n\nA: You could simply add\nsleep 10\n\nto the beginning of your script. This way, your script will \"sleep\" (wait) 10 seconds before continuing.\n\nA: For a more robust option, your cron job could be\n @reboot until [ -d /mnt/hgfs/somedir ]; do sleep 1; done; /my/script\n\nThat will wait until the directory actually exists, so you don't need to guess how long it will take or worry that it might take longer.\n", "Q: rsyslog for beginners I've just started to use rsyslog on an ubuntu 14 server. I am using it as a server to send logs from my firewalls / nas / routers etc. \nNew to all this so could do with some advice. Firstly, how to properly setup rsyslog to run as a server? I have it working, receiving information from the other devices but is there a better way to set this up other than the default. What about storing it in a mysql database?\nSecondly, I am looking for a web interface to manage it all. Preferably something clean, easy to use and realtime(if thats possible) I have had a look at logzilla which looks perfect but is no longer free. So what would people recommend?\nThanks\n\nA: If you have rsyslog running then it is, essentially, \"properly setup\".  Customization is going to be based on your specific needs.  If you can provide more detail we can probably give better advice.\nAs far as analyzing the data, LOGalyzer is open source.  You can check it out here:\nhttp://logalyze.com\nIt takes a bit of work to get running properly, but it's free.  You can also pay for support, but their prices are relatively hefty, especially if this is for non-work purposes.\n", "Q: How to move a program from a partition to another one? I'm new to Linux and Ubuntu, so sorry in advance if this is a noob question, but I don't know how to solve this situation.\nI've installed Virtual Box on Ubuntu, and I've also installed Truecrypt (That I Had used to create an Hidden encrypted Volume on the Hard Disk). Now, I want to move the program VirtualBox (That is installed on the partition not encrypted of the Hard Disk) to the partition encrypted with Truecrypt (The Hidden Volume).  \nI've searched for the Vitual Box folder or similar, where is installed the program, but is not like in windows or OSX where you only have to find the program and then you can move it wherever you want; in fact there is not just a folder for the program, but more than one. (For example I have in Usr/bin these files : Vbox, vboxautostart, vboxballoonctrl, xbox headless, vboxmanage, vboxsdl, vboxtunctl, vboxVRDP and vboxwebsrv; and then there is a folder called Virtualbox in Usr/lib).\nI don't know, probably I have to move the folder that is Usr/lib to the Encrypted Partition, or not? \nThanks in advance for any answer :)\n\nA: There are several ways you can do this. IMO it is easiest to mount your truecrypt partition to /usr/local and \"install\" vbox and the libs there.\nYou can manually copy vbox to /usr/local (/usr/local/bin , /usr/local/lib , etc) or compile vbox from source using the option PREFIX=/usr/local , then install.\nYou then need to make sure /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib is on your path.\nModify these directions if you choose an alternate mount point.\nProbably easier to keep vbox installed in the default location and when making a guest, place the guest virtual hard drive on your encrypted partition.\n", "Q: localhost links have stopped working in XAMPP? I have an XAMPP installation on Ubuntu 14.04 and its been working great ever since I installed it under 13.10, up until today. I was going to check something in my MySQL database via phpMyAdmin through the XAMPP page, which I normally access via localhost.\nHowever, I went to do this today, and I just get a page that looks like this:\n\nIf I access phpMyAdmin via localhost/phpmyadmin it pulls up just fine.\nHowever, none of my projects (all with index.html files in sub-folders) appear, or even the default index.html page. I added an index.html file to /var/www/html (I had read this question regarding the new apache version in 14.04) and it displayed that page.\nI also noticed that if I run the command sudo /opt/lampp/xampp start it says this:\nStarting XAMPP for Linux 1.8.3-3...\nXAMPP: Starting Apache...fail.                 <----------!!!\nXAMPP:  Another web server is already running. <----------!!!\nXAMPP: Starting MySQL...already running.\nXAMPP: Starting ProFTPD...already running.\n\nwhich makes me think that the updated version of apache (installed with 14.04) is interfering with XAMPP somehow.\nFunny thing is, if I FTP in (ProFTPD installed with XAMPP) I can see all of my files like normal. \nI know that XAMPP stores its files in /opt/lampp/htdocs, and all of my files are still there, but I can't access them.\nI have googled all over the place for a fix, no one else seems to have run into this issue yet. Is there a fix for this, or is XAMPP rendered useless with 14.04?\nEDIT:\nI installed XAMPP via the installer.run file from the Apache Friends website and I'm running XAMPP 1.8.3-3, as you could see. \nThe version of Apache is the default installed one for Ubuntu 14.04 2.4.7-1ubuntu4. Configuration is default AFAIK, nothing changed around. \nI would agree with the comments in saying that it looks like I have another instance of Apache installed, but I removed the LAMP bundle software I had previously installed before I installed XAMPP via the .run installer.\nEDIT:\napt-cache policy apache2 output, as suggested by Braiam:\napache2:\n  Installed: 2.4.7-1ubuntu4\n  Candidate: 2.4.7-1ubuntu4\n  Version table:\n *** 2.4.7-1ubuntu4 0\n        500 http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu/ trusty/main i386 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: You have the repository version of apache2 installed. That's why when you use /opt/lampp/xampp start it tells you that there's already another instance. \nJust remove that package and you should be all right. Here's how:\nsudo service apache2 stop\nsudo apt-get remove apache2\n\n", "Q: Why X is relying on software instead of hardware with \"nomodeset\" kernel parameter for 3D acceleration? My laptop is an ASUS K55N with AMD A8-4500M Trinity APU and integrated Radeon HD 7640G. Yesterday I tried at least 8 live sessions from different distros (slackware based, gentoo based, arch based, debian based, ubuntu based) with the same results: backlight off after suspend.\nWhat I've done so far that works better is to modify /etc/default/grub to:\nGRUB_CMD_LINE_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset acpi_osi=\"\n\nMy workaround works but only because Xfce does not rely on 3D acceleration. If you try to change to a compositor that relies on 3D acceleration you'll get into trouble with high temperatures. So, if you want to use a pretty and modern desktop like KDE, GNOME, Cinnamon, Unity or Pantheon you are going to need 3D acceleration hence you can't use nomodeset hence you can't Suspend.\nOn the other hand, what I know about nomodeset is it should not kill 3D hardware acceleration after X kicks in. \nThe question is:\nWhy X is relying on software instead of hardware with nomodeset kernel parameter for 3D acceleration?\nMore information at: bugs.launchpad.net\n\nA: From what I understand, the X.org guys have ripped out XAA (X Acceleration), and are requiring DRI (/dev/dri/card0) to be available to render anything other than via llvmpipe (software rendering). When you load with nomodeset and acpi_osi=, you are preventing your card from being detected by DRI.  You may be able to log in, but it will very sluggish.\nYou can test what you are running by typing\nglxinfo | less\nAnd searching for Gallium 3D and/or llvmpipe.\nThe glxinfo program may require the mesa-utils package, just\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\nTo install if needed.\n", "Q: UBUNTU 14.04 and WINDOWS 7 My Toshiba Satellite P875-S7310 has the capacity for dual hard drives. I want Windows 7 on one. And Ubuntu 14.04 on my other hard drive. My question is in what order and how should I install these operating systems. I've done a lot of researching but none of the scenarios match mine. The last thing I want to do is have to wipe my hard drives and restart the process after trial and error 50 times. Please give me options and opinions as soon as possible.\n\nA: It really depends on what you want. Personally I like to keep operating systems separated and each using their own boot manager, but that means pressing a few extra keys at boot up which can irritating if you switch between operating systems a lot.\nOption #1\nInstall Windows 7, and then install Ubuntu. This will result in 1 boot manager (Grub2) which means when you boot up you will see Grub2 and be able to choose whether to boot Windows or Ubuntu. This makes it easier to boot the operating systems, but more complicated to replace them since they share a boot manager.\nOption #2\nInstall Windows 7, remove the hard drive, install Ubuntu, and re-add the Windows 7 hard drive. This will result in each OSs being unaware of each other, and each using their own boot manager which is great if you ever replace 1 of the operating systems. When you turn the computer on it will automatically boot in Windows 7, no menu will be presented, but if you press the appropriate F# key at boot up you can use your quickboot menu to boot into Ubuntu instead by selecting to boot from the second hard drive. This option assumes your computer is capable of choosing which internal hard drive to boot from so if you go that route check your menu first to see if your system supports it.\n", "Q: Force PPA package to satisfy distro meta-package dependency I am building a package for my ppa that requires a newer implementation of libboost than what is provided in my target distro (precise). I've copied libboost1.55 from the boost ppa into my ppa.  I'm using pbuilder-dist to test my package build. I have successfully used the answer to this question to get pbuilder to get libboost packages from the ppa into the chroot environment.\nUnfortunately, while all the dependencies can be installed from the ppa as libboost-libname1.55-dev, none of them satisfy the meta package libboost-libname-dev and the pbuilder-dist build fails due to unsatisfied dependencies.\nSo, this question is not necessarily only tied to pbuilder-dist, but how would I either let pbuilder ignore the packages for dependencies (as I'm sure the dependency is met), or make apt-get consider the meta package dependency satisfied? I would prefer not to mess with the debian/control unless there is no other way.\n\nA: Because the main metapackage that is updated to depend on Boost 1.55 libraries isn't supplied through the PPA, you get the dependency errors. No builder (pbuilder or sbuild) or package manager (apt-get) will allow building/installing a package where the dependencies aren't met, as this indicates that the package will fail to build or work. Therefore, you will have to go into debian/control. To get around the error, try using dependency alternatives to specify using either the main metapackage if it is of a sufficient version or the alternative version.\nTo do this, in the case of a Boost module called name, the dependency for that module would look like libboost-name-dev (>= 1.55.0) | libboost-name1.55-dev. In this case, the libboost-name-dev will be used if it is at least version 1.55; otherwise, it will use libboost-name1.55-dev.\nNote that you may need to manually enable using alternatives in pbuilder.\n", "Q: Laptop Screen Black After Suspend I'm a new user to Linux and i am running into an issue with suspend on my laptop with the following configuration\nModel : HP Envy m6 (AMD A10-4600M APU with Radeon HD Graphics)\nOperating System : Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nIssue : When I close the lid of my laptop, or manually attempt to put it in suspend, it will shutdown like normal.

I noticed that with 14.04, the option \"safely remove\" is no longer there with external HDD's or flash drives.\nIt just says \"eject\" now. \nIs eject and safely remove now consolidated into one option, making \"eject\" safe to use?\n\nA: For flash drives, \"eject\" and \"safely remove\" have always been synonymous.  \nThe \"eject\" and \"safely remove\" options only have a different effect on drives with a mechanical ejection mechanism like CD or DVD drives connected via USB.\nThe reason why both options appeared on previous version was a technical limitation.  If I understand correctly, it's that the majority of USB flash drives \"pretend\" to have an eject mechanism even when they don't, and it doesn't do anything.\nUbuntu has now simplified the two options down to one, at least for USB flash drives.  It looks as if they've found a way around the issues mentioned in this bug.\n\nA: You can still \"Safely Remove\" but you have to open the \"Disk Utility\" app to accomplish it. \nFirst you should \"Eject\" the drive. Then you would open the Disk Utility app and select \"Safe Removal: power down the drive so it can be removed.\"\nThe issue with having the Safely Remove option in the context menu is that you generally don't want to power down devices that are INTERNAL; you only want to \"eject\" them. And the OS doesn't know if a device is internal/external. (If you \"Safely Remove\" an INTERNAL device, you will not have access to that device again until after doing a reboot. You can regain access to an EXTERNAL device by replugging it back in).\nTruthfully, I don't think it harms an external device at all to simply Eject and then pull it out. The Safely Remove option powers down the device via the OS. Just pulling the device out (after ejecting) powers down the device cause you pulled it away from its power supply. They both accomplish the same end as I understand it. So there is no harm AFAIK to just Ejecting and then pulling out your external drive/s.\n", "Q: Java: plugin install for freemind, get : NoClassDefFoundError org/objectweb/asm/Opcodes I am using freemind 0.9 on Ubuntu 12.04, and trying to install a plugin written with \"groovy\", from \nhttp://blog.icare3d.org/2011/02/writing-phd-thesis-using-freemind-and.html\nI installed freemind, freemind-plugins-script, put manually (and edited) the grrovy srcipt, edited  plugins/ScriptingEngine.xml as described in the link.

The Return key in my keyboard is broken, so I have chosen to make my PgDn key to act like the Return key. Now I learned how to do this using 'xmodmap'. The command I have to run is:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 117 = Return'\n\nBut I have to run this command everytime I reboot. I googled around and found that placing this command in the /etc/rc.local file should run it automatically at start-up. However, it does not work.\nCan anyone tell me how can I execute this command when I boot up? I am using Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Although you asked for a solution on startup, this might do what you want as well: to run a command on login, on user level, here is a simple one:\nFor example, to set the PageDown key as Return key on login:\nCreate a .desktop file as below, save it in ~/.config/autostart\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Set Keyboard\nExec=xmodmap -e 'keycode 117 = Return'\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nCopy the text above, paste it into an empty textfile (gedit), save it as set_keyboard.desktop (or anything_else.desktop) in ~/.config/autostart\n\nA: The easiest way to run commands at on user login (which is the best way to accomplish what you want) is to add the command to the .profile file (located in /home/[user]/).  You want to add the command to the end of the file.  For example:\n[user@host ~]# nano .profile\n# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.\n# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login\n# exists.\n# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.\n# the files are located in the bash-doc package.\n\n# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask\n# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.\n#umask 022\n\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\n# Remap Return key to Page Down on login\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 117 = Return'\n\nYou should be able to logout and log back in to make this change take effect.  However, it may be best just to reboot (to fully test it out).\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 - bit not working on bootable usb hello i went to download Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit and went to make my bootable usb and followed the steps and everything correctly and the usb showed install Ubuntu but when i went to setup my laptop and disable safe boot and change the usb to first in the boot order it keeps telling me there is no bootable image/file or something along those lines like was there something i missed or didn't do or is there a problem that people have been experiencing when downloading Ubuntu 32-bit/64-bit like it being a damaged download or whatever any help would be greatly appreciated as i am new to Ubuntu and the forums and would love to learn from you more experienced folks and become more knowledgeable with the Ubuntu Linux OS \n\nA: I use Linux Live USB Creator to make my linux bootable USB.
